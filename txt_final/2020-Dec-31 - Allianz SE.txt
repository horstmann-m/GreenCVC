BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Allianz Group structure

Allianz SE and its subsidiaries (the Allianz Group) offer property-casu-
alty insurance, life/health insurance, and asset management products
and services in over 70 countries, with the largest of our operations
located in Europe. The Allianz Group serves more than 100 million pri-
vate and corporate customers’. Allianz SE, the parent company of the
Allianz Group, has its headquarters in Munich, Germany.

The Allianz Group’‘s structure reflects both our business segments
and geographical regions. Business activities are organized by product
and type of service, based on how these are strategically managed:
insurance activities, asset management activities, and corporate and
other activities. Due to differences in the nature of products, risks, and
capital allocation, insurance activities are further divided into the two
categories property-casualty and life/health. In accordance with the
Board of Management's responsibilities, each of the insurance cate-
gories is grouped into regional reportable segments. In 2020, the
Allianz Group had 11 reportable segments.

Most of our insurance markets are served by local Allianz compa-
nies. However, some business lines — such as Allianz Global Corporate
& Specialty (AGCS), Allianz Partners (AP), and Euler Hermes — are run
globally.

Asset Management

Our two major investment management entities, PIMCO and
AllianzGl, operate under the governance of Allianz Asset Manage-
ment (AAM). We are one of the largest asset managers in the world
that actively manage assets. Our offerings cover a wide range of
equity, fixed income, cash, and multi-assets products as well as a
strongly growing number of alternative investment products, such as
infrastructure debt/equity, real assets, liquid alternatives, and solution
business. Our core markets are the United States, Canada, Germany,
France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Asia-Pacific region. As of
October 2020, PIMCO officially assumed oversight of Allianz Real Estate
and, as a result, Allianz Real Estate was transferred from the Corporate
and Other business segment into the Asset Management business seg-
ment. The combined entity forms one of the world’s largest and most
diversified real estate platforms.

Corporate and Other

The Corporate and Other business segment's activities include the
management and support of the Allianz Group’s businesses through
its central Holding functions, Banking and Alternative as well as Digital
Investments. The Holding functions manage and support the Group's
businesses through its strategy, risk, corporate finance, treasury, finan-
cial reporting, controlling, communication, legal, human resources,
technology, and other functions. Our Banking operations, which
place a primary focus on retail clients, support our insurance business
and complement the products we offer in Italy, France, and Bulgaria.
Digital Investments identifies and invests in digital growth companies
and provides digital investment management services and an inter-
face between portfolio companies and the Allianz Group.

BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
Allianz SE has a divisional Board structure based on functional and
business responsibilities. Business-related divisions reflect our business
segments Property-Casualty, Life/Health, Asset Management, and
Corporate and Other. In 2020, they were overseen by five board mem-
bers. The following divisions focus on Group functions and come with
business-related responsibilities: Chairman of the Board of Manage-
ment; Finance, Controlling and Risk; Investment Management; Opera-
tions and Allianz Services; Human Resources, Legal, Compliance and
M&A; and Business Transformation’.

For further information on Board of Management members and
their responsibilities, please refer to Mandates of the Members of the
Board of Management.

TARGET SETTING AND MONITORING

The Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business segments
via an integrated management and control process. It begins with the
definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which are dis-
cussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating entities.
Based on this strategy, our operating entities prepare three-year plans,
which are then aggregated to form the financial plans for the business
divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan also forms the
basis for our capital management. The Supervisory Board approves
the plan and sets corresponding targets for the Board of Manage-
ment. The performance-based remuneration of the Board of Manage-
ment is linked to short-term and long-term targets to ensure effective-
ness and emphasize sustainability. For further details about our remu-
neration structure, including target setting and performance assess-
ment, please refer to the Remuneration Report.

We continuously monitor our business performance against these
targets through monthly reviews — which cover key operational and fi-
nancial metrics — to ensure we can move quickly and take appropriate
measures in the event of negative developments. The Allianz Group
uses operating profit and net income as key financial performance in-
dicators across all its business segments. Other indicators include seg-
ment-specific figures, such as the combined ratio for Property-Casu-
alty, return on equity? and new business margins for Life/Health, and
the cost-income ratio for Asset Management. For a comprehensive
view of our business segment performance, please refer to the respec-
tive chapters on the following pages.

Besides performance steering, we also have a risk steering pro-
cess in place, which is described in the Risk and Opportunity Report.

{This member of the Board of Management also oversees Insurance Iberia & Latin America and Alling Partners.

Non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to as-
sess the organizational health of Allianz and are reflected in the an-
nual bonus of the Board of Management. In line with our Renewal
Agenda 2.0 motto “Simplicity Wins", Customer Centricity and em-
ployee commitment — the two key levers identified — are reflected in
two KPIs: the Net Promoter Score (NPS?) and the Inclusive Meritoc-
racy Index. For further information on non-financial KPls, please re-
fer to the Combined Separate Non-Financial Report for the
Allianz Group and Allianz SE (according to §§289b (3), 315b (3), sen-
tence 1, sentence 2 in conjunction with §298 (2) of the HGB) and for
an overview of the development and expected development of
these non-financial KPls, please refer to the chapter Outlook 2021,

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

Economic environment 2020"

2020 was the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which claimed almost
two million lives globally last year and brought entire economies to a
standstill. As a result, the world gross domestic product slumped by
around 4 %, by far the worst performance since the Second World War.
(By comparison, the Financial Crisis caused a drop of only 0.1 % in 2009.)
The blow from the pandemic on livelihoods could be cushioned, how-
ever — first and foremost in advanced economies — by unprecedented
fiscal policy measures: Governments’ outlays totaled more than €10tn
globally. This staggering level of support helped people and companies
to endure lockdowns, trade disruptions, and social distancing — at least
economically. Corporate insolvencies, for example, even declined by
around 10 % globally in 2020, defying economic logic in the face of a
severe recession. The flip side of generous fiscal support is rapidly esca-
lating public debt: It reached around 130% of world gross domestic
product in advanced economies in 2020.

The big fallin global economic activity conceals an unusually large
dispersion of performance in large economies. Reflecting diverging
strategies as well as their differing success in combating the pandemic,
the growth gap between China (+2.3% in 2020) and the Eurozone
(-6.8 % in 2020) amounted to nine percentage points; the gross domes-
tic product of the United States declined by 3.5 % in 2020.

Capital markets initially reacted with panic to the outbreak of
COVID-19; even the U.S. sovereign bond market, the backbone of the
global financial system, was not immune to dislocations. But as central
banks quickly stepped in, offering provisions of liquidity of unparalleled
scale, functionality was restored. As a consequence of the ongoing
monetary support, markets enjoyed a strong recovery since the March
turbulences, even setting new records in some areas such as corporate
bond issuance or initial public offers. Most equity markets concluded
2020 in positive territory, with the U.S. market, measured by the market-
wide index S&P 500, setting the pace with a plus of 16 %. On the other
hand, interest rates and yields dropped to new record lows: The 10-year
US. Treasury yield declined from 1.9 % to 0.9 %, while the 10-year Bund
yield dropped from -0.2 % to -0.6 % at the end of 2020.

Business environment 2020 for the insurance
industry

Initially, COVID-19 impacted both sides of the balance sheet of the
insurance industry. But entering the crisis with strong, well-capitalized
balance sheets and the quick rebound of markets helped to manage
temporary losses on the asset side. On the liability side, however,
underwriting losses emerged in particular in travel and event cancel-
lation, credit, and business interruption insurance. At the same time,
frozen activity during lockdowns lowered claims frequencies in some
lines of business. Global insured losses of natural catastrophes
increased sharply in 2020, mainly due to severe storms and wildfires in
the United States.

{At the date of the publication ofthis report, not all general market data for the year 2020 used in the chapter Business
Enviconment wos final. Also, please note that the information provided §in this chapter is based on our estimates.

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group

C_Group Management Report

The industry also had to cope with the operational challenge of
business continuity amidst lockdowns and social distancing: Accelerat-
ing digitalization was the answer to serving clients and maintaining
operations while protecting employees during the pandemic.

The property-casualty sector proved remarkably resilient in 2020.
Specifically, a hardening of rates helped stabilize premium income in
commercial lines, while in personal lines the intensive use of digital
channels mitigated the impact to new business that was caused by
mobility restrictions. Industry profitability came under stress as invest-
ment income kept declining. The impact on underwriting profitability,
however, was mixed: While some lines of business suffered from
COVID-19-related and natural catastrophe losses, others, in particular
motor, benefitted from lower claims frequencies during lockdowns.

In the life sector, premium income is very likely to have declined in
2020. To start with, products are in general less commoditized and thus
less suitable for digital channels. Furthermore, the high uncertainty
and ultra-low interest rates weighed on the demand for savings-type
insurance products, a trend that could only partially be offset by grow-
ing demand for protection products. The overall impact of COVID-19
on industry profitability was ambiguous as lines of business were dif-
ferently impacted. By and large, profitability remained challenged as
falling interest rates and yields affected investment income.

Business environment 2020 for the asset
management industry

In 2020, the asset management industry was severely impacted by the
COVID-19 driven market disruption at the end of the first quarter. After
years of steady growth, the industry's asset base was hit by financial
market volatility. Yet, with aid of monetary and fiscal stimulus, markets
recovered and the global economy was supported through the crisis.
Both bonds and equities saw a year of high returns with the MSCI
World Index increasing by 16 % in 2020, overcompensating the effects
at the end of the first quarter of 2020.

Overall, global assets continued to grow and exceeded
USD 110 tn for the first time. Although active investments still make up
for most assets under management, growth in both passive and alter-
native investments is continuing. Related acceleration in fee and prof-
itability compression for asset managers is partly compensated by an
expansion of alternative and private market offerings. Also, asset
managers are putting more focus on the growing importance of ESG-
engagement (ESG = Environment, Social, Governance) with investors,
impacting product design, fund allocation and performance objec-
tives.

During 2020, asset managers continued to invest in digitalization.
Accelerated by COVID-19, technology has become even more essen-
tial to drive customer engagement, data mining for information on
clients, operational efficiency, and regulatory and tax reporting.

Earnings summary

MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF 2020 RESULTS

On an internal basis®, our total revenues declined by 1.8% compared
to the previous year. Although most of this decline was attributable to
our Life/Health business in the United States and Germany, our Property-
Casualty business segment also registered a decrease, due to lower
volumes. Our Asset Management business segment, on the other
hand, generated higher revenues based on an all-time high total assets
under management (AuM) level.

Our operating profit decreased by 9.3% mostly due to adverse
impacts from COVID-19. We registered a decrease in operating profits in
three of our four business segments: in Property-Casualty, this was caused
by a sharp drop in the underwriting result as well as in the operating
investment result, with the former being due to COVID-19-related
losses and lower run-off. In Life/Health, operating profit decreased but
still remained on a strong level supported by a resilient investment
margin. The decline was mainly due to a positive prior-year impact in
the United States and the disposal of Allianz Popular S.L. in Spain. In
Corporate and Other, the operating result worsened, mainly driven by
a lower operating investment result. Our Asset Management business
segment, on the other hand, registered operating profit growth from
higher average AuM and continued cautious cost management.

Our operating investment result decreased by €220mn to
€ 23,634 mn, driven by significantly higher impairments and lower interest
and similar income, partly offset by higher realizations on debt securi-
ties and a higher trading result.

Our non-operating result worsened by €370 mn, resulting in a
€ 1,148 mn loss. Key drivers were higher restructuring and integration
expenses.

Income taxes decreased by € 305 mn to €2,471 mn, a result of
lower pre-tax income. The effective tax rate increased to 25.7% (2019:

2019.

The lower operating profit and worsened non-operating result led
to a decrease in net income.

Our shareholders’ equity’ increased by €6.8bn to €80.8bn,
largely due to a net income attributable to shareholders of € 6.8 bn, a
€5.0 bn increase in unrealized gains and losses (net) and the issuance
of undated subordinated bonds of € 2.3 bn. Part of the increase was
offset by a € 4.0 bn dividend payout, the € 2.2 bn lower foreign currency
translation adjustments, as well as € 750 mn for the purchase of 4.9
million own shares®. Our Solvency II capitalization ratio was strong at
207%’.

Total revenues?

On a nominal basis, we recorded a slight increase in total revenues by
0.4% compared to the previous year.

This included unfavorable foreign currency translation effects to
the amount of € 1,088 mn’ and positive (de)consolidation effects of
€ 2,201 mn. On an internal basis, our revenues decreased by 1.5%,
driven mainly by a negative volume effect of 4.8% and a positive price
effect of 3.8%.

The following operations contributed positively to internal growth

AGCS: Total revenues were € 9,339 mn, a 4.2% increase on an
internal basis. Key drivers were price increases in our Liability, Financial
Lines, and Property lines of business.

Turkey: Total revenues went up 17.1% on an internal basis, total-
ing € 1,003 mn. Much of this increase was owed to favorable volume
effects in our health and motor insurance business.

Germany: Total revenues amounted to € 10,918 mn, an internal
growth of 1.6%. Key drivers were price increases in our motor and prop-
erty insurance business.

The following operations weighed on internal growth:

Allianz Partners: Total revenues went down 19.0% on an internal
basis, totaling € 5,336 mn. The main reason for this was that the
COVID-19 pandemic caused a volume decline in our travel insurance
business.

Euler Hermes: Total revenues amounted to € 2,755 mn, an inter-
nal decrease by 7.0%. Much of it was due to COVID-19-related unfa-
vorable volume effects in our credit insurance business.

Italy: Total revenues fell to € 3,794 mn, a decrease of 5.0% on an
internal basis. It was largely due to negative price effects in our motor
insurance business.

We registered a sharp drop in our operating profit. While most of it was
driven by our underwriting result, our operating investment income
also contributed negatively.

The decrease in our underwriting result was due to an overall
negative impact of COVID-19 amounting to € 1.1 bn, higher claims
from natural catastrophes, and a lower contribution from run-off. On
the other hand, strong improvements on the expenses side had a par-

‘C_Group Management Report

The following operations contributed positively to the development of
our accident year loss ratio’

Italy: 0.5 percentage points, due to a reduction in claims fre-
quency.

France: 0.4 percentage points, also driven by a reduction in
claims frequency.

Allianz Direct: 0.3 percentage points, due to reduced claims fre-
quencies across all markets, with the strongest impact recorded in our
motor insurance business in Italy.

The following operations weighed on the development of our accident
year loss ratio:

AGCS: 0.9 percentage points. The deterioration resulted from an
increase in natural catastrophes and a severe impact of COVID-19,
mostly on the losses from the Entertainment line of business.

Reinsurance: 0.7 percentage points. This increase was mainly
due to the negative effects from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our positive run-off result was € 431 mn — after € 1,059 mn in 2019 —
translating into a run-off ratio of 0.8%. Reserve releases stemmed par-
ticularly from our operations in Reinsurance, Australia, and Italy, but
were in many operations lower compared to 2019, leading to a drop
in run-off. AGCS continued to have a negative impact on our run-off
result.

Acquisition and administrative expenses amounted to € 13,846 mn in
2020, after €14,119mn in the previous year. Our expense ratio
improved significantly by 0.7 percentage points to 26.8%, as it bene-
fited from our acquisitions in the United Kingdom and a positive busi-
ness mix development at Allianz Partners.

currency translation effects of € 510 mn as well as positive (de-)con-
solidation effects of € 137 mn. On an internal basis, statutory premi-
ums dropped by 2.6% — or € 2,009 mn — to € 74,296 mn.

In the German life business, statutory premiums totaled
€ 26,232 mn, a 5.4% decrease on an internal basis that was largely
driven by lower single premium sales in our business with capital-effi-
cient products. In the German health business, statutory premiums
went up to € 3,741 mn. The increase — 4.6% on an internal basis —
mainly resulted from premium adjustments in comprehensive
healthcare coverage as well as from the acquisition of new customers
in supplementary healthcare coverage.

In the United States, statutory premiums declined to € 9,915 mn,
a decrease of 17.6% on an internal basis. Most of it was caused by
declining sales of fixed index annuity products, with the effect partly
offset by higher sales for non-traditional variable annuity products.

In Italy, statutory premiums grew to € 12,487 mn. Key drivers of
this increase — 15.4% on an internal basis — were stronger sales for unit-
linked and capital-efficient products, while weaker sales of guaran-
teed savings & annuities contributed negatively.

In France, statutory premiums decreased to € 7,409 mn, an 8.8%
drop on an internal basis. It was largely attributable to lower sales of
our guaranteed savings & annuity products.

In the Asia-Pacific region, statutory premiums went up to
€ 6,049 mn, translating into a 9.3% increase on an internal basis. For
the most part, it was due to sales increases for unit-linked products in
Indonesia as well as guaranteed savings & annuity products in Taiwan.

Our PVNBP decreased by € 5,450 mn to € 65,448 mn, impacted by
COVID-19 restrictions. Most of the drop was a result of the lower sales
volumes for capital-efficient products in the German life business, fixed
index annuities in the United States, and guaranteed savings & annui-
ties in France. The negative effects were partly offset by increased vol-
umes from unit-linked products in Italy.

lower investment margin in France. Other drivers included the exten-
sion of the amortization period for deferred acquisition costs in the
United States in 2019, resulting in a favorable effect in that year, as well
as the disposal of Allianz Popular S.L. in Spain. Positive effects partly
offsetting the decrease came from the unlocking of assumptions, as
well as from a model refinement in the United States, an improved
investment margin in our German life business due to a higher
reserve base, and increased unit-linked management fees in Italy. We
also registered higher volumes and lower claims in the Asia-Pacific

Loadings from premiums decreased as sales volumes declined, above
all, for capital-efficient products in our German life business, but also
in guaranteed savings & annuities in Thailand. Stronger sales of pro-
tection & health products in the United States partly offset this devel-
opment. Loadings from reserves went up, largely driven by higher
reserve volumes in our German life business and remained stable in
relation to reserves. Unit-linked management fees went down, mainly
due to the disposal of Allianz Popular S.L. in Spain, an effect partly

Our investment margin increased. In the United States, we registered
positive effects from the unlocking of assumptions and from a model
refinement in both our fixed index and our variable annuity businesses
as well as from a recovered spread margin in the fixed index annuity
business. On the other hand, we saw increased hedging expenses, due
to market turbulences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in our vari-
able annuity business, which, however, only partly offset the positive
developments. In our German life business, higher realizations from
debt securities and equity instruments and an increased trading result
outweighed higher impairments from equities and a decrease in inter-
est income. In Switzerland, increased realizations and reduced reserve
strengthening contributed positively. Negative developments included
an increase in impairments from equities, due to the pandemic, and a
decline in interest income in France, which could not be offset by higher
realizations and lower policyholder participations.

Acquisition expenses and commissions decreased along with lower
sales volumes, particularly in our U.S. fixed index annuity business and
in our capital-efficient products in our German life business. This was
partly offset by higher unit-linked sales in Italy as well as stronger pro-
tection & health sales in France. Administrative and other expenses
went up along with the increase in our reserves.

TECHNICAL MARGIN?

Our technical margin decreased, mainly because of a lower lapse
margin in the United States but also deteriorated risk margins in Swit-
zerland and France. The deconsolidation of Allianz Popular S.L. in
Spain also weighed on the margin. Positive factors included lower
claims and volume growth in the Asia-Pacific region as well as an
improved lapse result in Italy.

Impact of change in DAC (206) 243 (450)

The impact of change in DAC turned negative, driven mainly by our
business in the United States. After an extension of the DAC amortiza-
tion period had caused a favorable effect in the previous year, amorti-
zation rose, also due to the loss recognition in the long-term care busi-
ness. Other drivers included the unlocking of assumptions in both our
fixed index and our variable annuity businesses as well as the recov-
ered spread margin in the fixed index annuity business. Lower capital-
ization was largely due to lower sales volumes in our fixed index annu-
ity products in the United States, an effect partly compensated by
stronger sales of unit-linked products in Italy and guaranteed savings
& annuity products in Taiwan.

Adecline in operating profit in our guaranteed savings & annuities line
of business was largely driven by increased hedging expenses and
lower loadings and fees in our U.S. variable annuity business. Another
key development was a shift to capital-efficient products, combined
with a lower contribution due to a smaller portfolio share in the Ger-
man life business. The operating profit in the protection & health line
of business decreased. Key drivers included the loss recognition in the
U.S. long-term care business, a deteriorated combined ratio in France,
and the deconsolidation of Allianz Popular S.L. in Spain. Lower claims
as well as growth in the Asia-Pacific region had a partially offsetting
effect. The operating profit generated by our unit-linked without guar-
antee line of business went down. Most of the decline resulted from the
disposal of Allianz Popular S.L. in Spain and a lower technical margin
in France, due to negative one-off effects. The rise registered in the op-
erating profit in the capital-efficient products line of business was pri-
marily due to lower acquisition costs and a higher portfolio share in the
German life business. Other contributing factors included the unlock-
ing of assumptions and a model refinement, as well as the recovered
spread margin in the United States. This was partly offset by a change
in the DAC amortization period in the United States in 2019, leading to
a favorable effect in that year, and in a corresponding negative impact
in 2020.

Net income

Our net income increased by € 243 mn. A higher non-operating result
— mainly due to increased realizations from the disposal of Allianz
Popular S.L. in Spain — and reduced income taxes outweighed the
decrease in operating profit.

Return on equity

Our return on equity remained stable at 12.8%.

3The impact of change in DAC includes effects of the change in DAC, uneamed revenue reserves (URR), and the value of
business acquired (VOBA). It represents the net impact of deferral and amortization of acquisition costs and front-end
loadings on operating profit and therefore deviates from the IFRS financial statements

investment success ofall third-party assets that are managed by Allianz Asset Management's portolio-management
Units. For separate accounts and mutual funds, the investment success (valued on the basis of the closing prices) is
‘compared with the investment success prior to cost deduction of the respective benchmark, based on various metrics.
For some mutual funds, the investment success, reduced by fees, is compared with the investment success of the
median of the respective Morningstar peer group (a position in the first and second quartile is equivalent to
utperformance).

The decline in the overall three-year rolling investment outperfor-
mance is due to COVID-19-driven significant market dislocations and
the fact that often the investment universe for a global active manager

is significantly different from the respective benchmark.

Operating revenues

Our operating revenues increased by 2.6 % on a nominal basis. This
was driven by higher average third-party AUM mainly at PIMCO, due
to strong market effects — especially from fixed-income assets — com-
bined with net inflows. These positive impacts were partly offset by un-
favorable foreign currency translation effects. On an internal basis’,
operating revenues grew by 3.6 %.

Performance fees were lower in alternative assets as a result of
the extreme volatility in the first quarter of 2020. While PIMCO recov-
ered strongly in the second half of the year, AllianzG! was burdened by
the challenging performance environment in the context of COVID-19
over the year.

Other net fee and commission income rose, driven by higher av-
erage third-party AUM mainly at PIMCO.

Other operating revenues decreased due to a lower net interest
and similar income.

Operating profit

Our operating profit increased by 5.5 % on a nominal basis, as growth
in operating revenues by far exceeded an increase in operating ex-
penses. On an internal basis’, our operating profit went up by 7.2 %,
which was due to higher average third-party AUM.

The nominal increase in administrative expenses was driven by
PIMCO and due to investments in business growth and infrastructure.

Our cost-income ratio went down as a consequence of stronger
growth in operating revenue and a lower increase in operating ex-
penses, compared to the previous year.

Economic outlook?

The downside risks are sizeable. First and foremost, vaccination
hurdles on the demand side (vaccination skepticism) as well as the

2021 will be the year of the vaccine. The progress of the global vac-
cination campaign will be the decisive factor for the economic recovery
from the pandemic. After a lackluster start into 2021 — due to new
COVID-19 restrictions in Europe and other parts of the world — a suc-
cessful vaccination of vulnerable populations (20 - 40% of the total)
should set the stage for moderate growth in the second half of 2021.
Main driver of the rebound will be the return of confidence, helping to
restart the service economy, to unleash forced and precautionary sav-
ings, and to resume corporate investments. Allin all, we expect global
gross domestic product to expand by 4.6% in 2021, with China setting
the pace (+8.4%) and the United States and the Eurozone registering
more modest growth of 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively.

supply side (production and distribution bottlenecks) could easily
derail the recovery; in that respect, the slow start to the vaccination
rollout in Europe is not promising. Other risks include an unexpected
strong bout of inflation, a premature withdrawal of fiscal and mone-
tary support, a spike in insolvencies and social unrest in response to
rising inequalities and poverty in the aftermath of the pandemic.

In our base case scenario, however, we expect policymakers to
step up support to limit long-term scarring to the economy and provide
a tailwind to the recovery. On the fiscal side, in Europe, safety net
measures look set to be extended while in the United States stimulus
spending will be stepped up in 2021. Meanwhile, central banks will
continue with their bond purchases to ensure favorable refinancing
rates to the public and the private sectors, with the U.S. Federal
Reserve and European Central Bank maintaining record-low interest
rates for the time being.

At the beginning of 2021, equity markets have already consumed
most of the optimism story and high valuations provide very little

tionary expectations as the economic recovery unfolds.

Insurance industry outlook

The expected economic recovery and heightened risk awareness after
the pandemic should give insurance markets some tailwinds in 2021.
Premiums are likely to increase in some lines of business. One of the
legacies of the pandemic that will shape 2021(and the following
years) is accelerated digitalization: digital processes and distribution
channels will continue to become more relevant. Another legacy, less
pleasant, are low or even negative interest rates, which have become
even more entrenched. Thus, falling investment returns will impact
industry profitability in 2021 and beyond.

In the non-life sector, premium growth is expected to return to pre-
crisis levels, with emerging markets — and particularly China — outper-
forming advanced markets by a wide margin. Besides the recovery,
another supportive factor is the ongoing hard market in commercial
lines. On the other hand, investment income will remain under pressure
and in some business lines claims from COVID-19 are likely to drag on.
Social inflation and impacts from natural catastrophes are other fac-
tors that could drive claims higher and thus require thorough claims
management to preserve underwriting profitability.

In the life sector, premium income should Largely rebound in 2021.
This optimism is based on two observations: the pandemic should have
raised the awareness of the need for risk cover, especially for
healthcare and life insurance, and the lockdowns have swollen the
amount of excess savings, parts of which might be used to bolster old-
age provisions. But there are also reasons to be cautious: first and fore-
most, ultra-low interest rates, which will not only impact profitability
but also continue to weigh on the demand for savings-type insurance
products.

Asset management industry outlook

Monetary easing by central banks across the globe as well as fiscal
support by many governments in the context of the COVID-19 pan-
demic, massively helped capital markets. Market volatility, on the
other hand, is very likely to persist and investors are expected to stay
alert. We therefore expect a volatile and overall moderate capital
market contribution to assets under management growth.

The asset management industry benefits from the strong market
performance, but nevertheless industry profitability remains under
pressure, due to continuous flows into passive products, new pricing
models and rising distribution costs. We also expect the trend towards
industry consolidation to persist, accompanied by a growing cost
awareness. Both developments lead to respective restructuring activ-
ities within the industry. At the same time, digital channels such as
robo-advisory platforms are likely to continue gaining traction. The
strengthening of regulatory oversight and reporting could also affect
profitability in the asset management sector. Opportunities in the
area of active asset management will continue to exist, particularly in
alternative and solutions-oriented strategies, but also in the area of
ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) investing. We expect the

74

COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the already existing trends within
the industry. In order to continue growing, it will remain vital for asset
managers to keep sufficient business volumes, ensure efficient opera-
tions, and maintain a strong investment performance.

‘ALLIANZ GROUP.

Operating profit of € 12.0 bn, plus or minus € 1 bn.

Protect shareholder value while continuing to provide attractive returns
cand dividends.

Selective profitable growth.

NPS: for over 75 % of Allianz Group business segments to outperform
their local market (meaning either above market or Loyalty Leader
position).

IMIX of 73 % plus.

Revenue growth of up to 6 % of which 1 % will come from our acquisition
in Spain.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

Operating profit of € 5.6 bn, plus or minus 10 %

Combined ratio of approximately 93 %.

Pressure on operating investment income (net) to continue, due to
reinvestments in a consistently low interest rate environment.

LIFE/HEALTH Continue to focus on profitable growth; keep developing capital-efficient
products; expand to new markets. Revenues expected to be in the range

of € 67.0 bn to € 73.0 bn.

Operating profit of € 44 bn, plus or minus 10 %
RoE between 10.0 % and 13.0 %.

Pressure on investment income due to low interest rates and continued
capital market volatility.

ASSET MANAGEMENT Moderate increase in AuM driven by slight positive market return

combined with third-party net inflows at PIMCO and AllianzGl.
Operating profit € 2.8 bn, plus or minus 10 %

Costincome ratio approximately 62 %

ASSUMPTIONS
Our outlook assumes no significant deviations from our underlying as-
sumptions — specifically:

Expected global economic recovery,
— Interest rates to remain at the current level,

— A100 basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates would
raise (lower) the expected operating profit by less than
€0.1 bn in the first year that follows the rate change.

— No major disruptions in the capital markets,

— No disruptive fiscal or regulatory interference,

— Level of claims from natural catastrophes at expected average
levels,

— Anaverage U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate of 1.17.

-— A 10% weakening (strengthening) of the U.S. Dollar, com-
pared to the assumed exchange rate of 1.17 to the Euro,
would have a negative (positive) effect on operating profits of
approximately € 0.4 bn.

Management's assessment of expected revenues
and earnings for 2021

In 2020, our total revenues were € 140.5 bn, a 1.3% decrease on a
nominal and a 1.8 % decrease on an internal basis,! compared to 2019.
For 2021, we envisage moderate growth, with strong growth in Prop-
erty-Casualty, moderate growth in Asset Management and
Life/Health revenues remaining rather stable, owing to our selective
focus on profitable growth.

Our 2020 operating profit was € 10.8 bn, with the pandemic re-
ducing it by an estimated € 1.3 bn. As we do not expect continued ma-
terial impact from the pandemic for 2021 comparable to last year, we
envisage strong performance in all business segments and an overall
operating profit of € 12.0 bn, plus or minus € 1.0 bn for this year.

Our net income attributable to shareholders was also affected by
the pandemic in 2020, reaching a total of € 6.8 bn in 2020. Consistent
with our disclosure practice in the past, and given the susceptibility of
our non-operating results to capital market developments, we refrain
from providing a precise outlook for net income. However, as our out-
look presumes no major disruptions in our capital markets we antici-
pate a higher net income for 2021.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY INSURANCE
We expect our revenues to increase by up to 6 % in 2021 (2020: 0.4 %),
assuming a fast recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 1%
will come from our acquisition in Spain. Organic growth will be sup-
ported by favorable price and volume effects.

We expect revenue growth at Allianz Partners where we have
pooled our B2B2C activities. We expect growth to pick up here in the
second half of the year, depending on further developments of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Further growth is likely to happen in Germany
and Ireland as well as in Asian markets such as China

We believe that the overall rise in prices that we saw in a number
of markets in the past year will continue in 2021. Nevertheless, we will
maintain our focus on achieving strong underwriting results by adher-
ing to our strict underwriting discipline, as we have in previous years,
and we will be prepared to accept a lower top line if we fail to achieve
target margins.

Our combined ratio was 96.3 % in 2020, missing our target. This
was mainly due to negative COVID-19 impacts. In 2021, we envisage a
combined ratio of approximately 93 %. The underlying assumption is
that the aggregate effect of improvements in pricing, claims manage-
ment, and productivity will compensate for any inflation in underlying
claims. Furthermore, impacts from COVID-19 are mainly expected from
Euler Hermes and Allianz Partners. As for impacts from natural catas-
trophes, despite the highly volatile nature of such catastrophes in recent
years we assume claims to continue at comparable levels going for-
ward.

As the low-interest-rate environment is likely to stay, investment in-
come will remain under pressure due to the rather short investment
spans in our Property-Casualty business segment. Going forward, we
will continue to actively adapt our investment strategy to changing
market conditions.

Overall, we expect our 2021 operating profit to be at € 5.6 bn, plus
or minus 10 % (2020: € 4.4 bn).

C_Group Management Report

LIFE/HEALTH INSURANCE

At € 4.4 bn, our Life/Health operating profit was within the target range
in 2020. For 2021, we expect this business segment's operating profit
to be at € 4.4 bn, plus or minus 10 %.

One of the key performance indicators used in steering our
Life/Health business segment is RoE. In 2021, we expect it to be be-
tween 10.0 % and 13.0 %.

Allianz continuously works to make the Life/Health business
model more resilient to market volatility, for instance, by adjusting our
products to market needs while keeping in line with our strategy. Go-
ing forward, we will continue to pursue profitable growth and to im-
prove our capital-efficient products — always with a particular focus
on the customer — while exploring new market opportunities and
building on our strong track record of product innovation. In addition,
we will continue to actively manage both our new and our in-force
business through continuous price reviews, expense management, as-
set/liability management, crediting strategies and reinsurance solu-
tions. As in the past years, this should allow us to mitigate the impacts
of difficult market conditions, in particular negative interest rates, and
achieve our profitability targets.

ASSET MANAGEMENT
For 2021, we envisage overall moderate third-party net inflows and
market returns at both PIMCO and AllianzGl, with relatively stable
margins and stable performance fees, resulting in modest growth in
operating revenues. We also assume the U.S. Dollar to remain rela-
tively stable compared to 2020. All things considered, we expect our
2021 operating profit to be at €2.8bn, plus or minus 10 % (2020:
€2.9 bn).

Our cost-income ratio is expected to be approximately 62% in
2021(2020: 61.2 %) as we continue to invest in business growth. Over
the mid-term, we expect to maintain it at that level.

CORPORATE AND OTHER (INCLUDING
CONSOLIDATION)

We recorded an operating loss of € 0.8 bn in Corporate and Other in
2020. For 2021, we envisage an operating loss of € 0.8 bn, plus or mi-
nus 10 %.

Non-financial key performance indicators

As outlined in our Remuneration Report as well as the section “Our
Strategy” in our Risk and Opportunity Report, we have set ourselves
non-financial targets. Below, we provide an overview of how the most
important of these targets have developed, and are expected to de-
velop in 2021.

NET PROMOTER SCORE (NPS)

We achieved the highest ever measured NPS results for Allianz, with:

— 45 out of 57 measured segments having been either above local
market or Loyalty Leaders resulting in a share of 79 % (2019: 70 %)

— 34 out of 57 measured segments having been Loyalty Leaders re-
sulting in a share of 60 % (2019: 46 %).

This means that we exceeded the 2021 group target (75 % plus outper-
forming) one year ahead of time. Main drivers for this success have
been the VOICE of the customer initiative, product simplifications, ex-
panding digital service offerings and COVID-19 measures.

INCLUSIVE MERITOCRACY INDEX (IMIX)
Our IMIX was 78 % in 2020, a five percentage point improvement com-
pared to 2019. For 2021, our IMIX target is 73 % plus. Although the
Allianz Group already exceeded its 2021 targets in 2020, we will start
working on new global focus areas and continue with the VOICE initi-
ative in order to further improve results.

Financing, liquidity development,
and capitalization

Allianz Group enjoys a very robust liquidity position and excellent fi-
nancial strength as well as healthy business mix and global diversifi-
cation, which allow us to outperform despite challenges in the perfor-
mance of our industrial insurance segment following the COVID-19
pandemic. Allianz Group Solvency II capitalization is well above regu-
latory requirements.

As a result, we have full access to financial markets and are ina
position to raise financing at low cost. We are determined to maintain
our financial flexibility, which is supported by both prudent steering of
our liquidity resources and our well-balanced debt maturity profile.

We are managing our portfolios with great diligence to ensure
that the Group has sufficient resources to back its solvency capital and
liquidity needs. In addition, we will continue to monitor the sensitivity
of our Solvency II capitalization ratio with regard to changes in inter-
est rates and spreads, by continuing to ensure prudent asset/liability
management and life product design.

Expected dividend development!

Allianz management is committed to have shareholders participate in
the economic development of Allianz Group through dividend pay-
ments. Through prudent capital management, Allianz Group aims to
maintain a healthy balance between an attractive yield and invest-
ment in profitable growth. Of the Group's net income attributable to
shareholders, we will continue to pay out 50 % as a regular dividend,

‘This represents management’ current state of planning and may be revised in the future. Also, note that the decision
regarding dividend payments in any given year is subject to spectic dividend proposals by the Management and Super
\isory Boards, each of which may elect to deviate, if and as appropriate under the then prevailing circumstances, as well
1s to the approval ofthe Annual General Meeting.

76

While the 2020 earnings are impacted by the COVID-19 crisis,
Allianz Group aims to keep the regular dividend per share at least at
the previous year’s level. For 2020, the Allianz SE Board of Manage-
ment and the Supervisory Board propose a dividend of € 9.60 per
share.

In addition, as part of our policy to return capital to the sharehold-
ers on a flexible basis, Allianz SE executed five share buy-back pro-
grams with an aggregate volume of EUR 8.2 bn in the period from
2017 to 2020. Due to the ongoing economic uncertainties caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic, Allianz SE’s Board of Management an-
nounced on 6 November 2020 that it would no longer execute the sec-
ond tranche of € 750 mn of the initial announced € 1.5 bn 2020 share
buy-back program.

lL of the above remains subject to our sustainable Solvency Il
capitalization ratio above 160 % — which is considerably below our
year-end 2020 level of 207 %? and 20 percentage points below our
minimum solvency ambition for the Solvency II capitalization ratio of
180 %.

Management's overall assessment of the current
economic situation of the Allianz Group

At the date of issuance of this Annual Report and based on current in-
formation regarding natural catastrophes and capital market trends —
in particular foreign currency, interest rates, and equities —, the Board
of Management has no indication that the Allianz Group is facing any
major adverse developments.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact
on individuals, society, business and the wider economy across the
globe. The insurance industry was hit, but the Allianz Group has re-
sponded quickly, has introduced measures to mitigate the adverse im-
pact and still continues to run its business profitably.

LIABILITIES

PROPERTY-CASUALTY LIABILITIES

As of 31 December 2020, the business segment's gross reserves for loss
and loss adjustment expenses as well as discounted loss reserves
amounted to € 72.8 bn, compared to € 70.0 bn at year-end 2019. On
a net basis, our reserves, including discounted loss reserves, increased
from € 60.1 bn to € 62.0 bn.*

LIFE/HEALTH LIABILITIES

Life/Health reserves for insurance and investment contracts increased
by € 23.2 bn to €596.1 bn. A € 20.0 bn increase (before foreign cur-
rency translation effects) in aggregate policy reserves was driven by
our operations in Germany (€ 14.5 bn) and the United States (€ 6.9 bn
before foreign currency translation effects). Reserves for premium
refunds increased by € 13.3 bn (before foreign currency translation
effects), due to higher unrealized gains to be shared with policyhold-
ers. Foreign currency translation effects decreased the balance sheet
value by € 10.3 bn, mainly due to the weaker U.S. Dollar (€ 9.2 bn).

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, the Allianz Group may enter into
arrangements that do not lead to the recognition of assets and liabili-
ties in the Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS. Since the
Allianz Group does not rely on off-balance sheet arrangements as a sig-
nificant source of revenue or financing, our off-balance sheet exposure
to loss is immaterial relative to our financial position.

The Allianz Group enters into various commitments including loan
commitments, purchase obligations, and other commitments. For more
details, please refer to note 38 to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments.

The Allianz Group has also entered into contractual relationships
with various types of structured entities. They have been designed in
such a way that their relevant activities are directed by means of con-
tractual arrangements rather than voting or similar rights. Typically,
structured entities have been set up in connection with asset-backed
financing and certain investment fund products. For more details on our
involvement with structured entities, please refer to note 36 to the Con-
solidated Financial Statements.

Please refer to the Risk and Opportunity Report for a description
of the main concentrations of risk and other relevant risk positions.

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RESOURCES

Organization

The Allianz Group's liquidity management is based on policies and
guidelines approved by the AllianzSE Board of Management.
Allianz SE and each of the operating entities are responsible for
managing their respective liquidity positions, while Allianz SE provides
central cash pooling for the Group. Capital allocation is managed by
Allianz SE for the entire Group. This structure allows the efficient use of
liquidity and capital resources and enables Allianz SE to achieve the
desired liquidity and capitalization levels for the Group and its operat-
ing entities.

Liquidity management of our operating entities

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Major sources of liquidity for our operational activities are
primary and reinsurance premiums received, reinsurance receivables
collected, investment income, and proceeds generated from the
maturity or sale of investments. These funds are mainly used to pay
claims arising from the Property-Casualty insurance business and
related expenses, life policy benefits, surrenders and cancellations,
acquisition costs, and operating costs.

We receive a large part of premiums before payments of claims
or policy benefits are required, generating solid cash flows from our
insurance operations. This allows us to invest the funds in the interim to
create investment income.

Our insurance operations also carry a high proportion of liquid
investments, which can be converted into cash to pay for claims.
Generally, our investments in fixed-income securities are sequenced to
mature when funds are expected to be needed.

The overall liquidity of our insurance operations depends on cap-
ital market developments, interest rate levels, and our ability to realize
the market value of our investment portfolio to meet insurance claims
and policyholder benefits. Other factors affecting the liquidity of our
Property-Casualty insurance operations include the timing, frequency,
and severity of losses underlying our policies and policy renewal rates.
In our Life operations, liquidity needs are generally influenced by
trends in actual mortality rates compared to the assumptions underly-
ing our life insurance reserves. Market returns, crediting rates, and the
behavior of our life insurance clients — for example, regarding the level
of surrenders and withdrawals — can also have significant impacts.

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group

ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS

Within our Asset Management operations, the most important sources
of liquidity are fees generated from asset management activities.
These are primarily used to cover operating expenses.

Liquidity management and funding of Allianz SE

The responsibility for managing the funding needs within the Group,
maximizing access to liquidity sources and minimizing borrowing costs,
lies with Allianz SE. We therefore comment on the liquidity and funding
resources of Allianz SE in the following sections. Restrictions on the
transferability of capital within the Group mainly result from the capital
maintenance rules under applicable company laws, as well as from
the regulatory solvency capital requirements for regulated Group
companies.

LIQUIDITY RESOURCES AND USES

Allianz SE ensures adequate access to liquidity and capital for our
operating subsidiaries. The main sources of liquidity available for
Allianz SE are dividends received from subsidiaries and funding pro-
vided by capital markets. Liquidity resources are defined as readily
available assets — specifically cash, money market investments, and
highly liquid government bonds. Our funds are primarily used for
interest payments on our debt funding, operating costs, internal and
external growth investments, and dividends to our shareholders.

FUNDING SOURCES

Allianz SE's access to external funds depends on various factors such
as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings,
and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz SE in
the capital markets for short-, mid- and long-term funding needs are
described below. In general, mid- to long-term financing is covered by
issuing senior or subordinated bonds or ordinary no-par value shares.

SHARE CAPITAL
As of 31 December 2020, the issued share capital as registered at the
Commercial Register was € 1,169,920,000. This was divided into
412,293,128 no-par value shares. As of 31 December 2020, the
Allianz Group held 247,489 (2019: 595,677) own shares.

Allianz SE has the option to increase its share capital according to
authorizations provided by the AGM. The following table outlines
Allianz SE's capital authorizations as of 31 December 2020:

LONG-TERM DEBT FUNDING

As of 31 December 2020, Allianz SE had senior and subordinated
bonds with a variety of maturities outstanding, reflecting our focus on
long-term financing. As the cost and availability of external funding
may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by
matters specific to the financial services industry or the Allianz Group,
we seek to reduce refinancing risk by actively steering the maturity

ties increased in the use of commercial paper, compared to the previ-
ous year-end. Interest expenses on money market securities decreased
mainly due to lower funding costs on average in 2020.

The Group maintained its A-1+/Prime-1 ratings for short-term
issuances. We can therefore continue funding our liquidity under the
Euro Commercial Paper Program at an average rate for each tranche
below Euribor, and under the U.S. Dollar Commercial Paper Program
at an average rate for each tranche below U.S. Libor.

Further potential sources of short-term funding that allow the
Allianz Group to fine-tune its capital structure are letter of credit facili-
ties and bank credit lines.

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group

‘Includes effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of € (758) mn and € 90 mn in 2020 and 2019,
respectively

Net cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to € 32.0 bn
in 2020, down by € 4.4 bn compared to the previous year. This figure
comprises net income plus adjustments for non-cash charges, credits,
and other items included in net earnings, as well as cash flows related
to the net change in operating assets and liabilities. Net income after
adding back non-cash charges and similar items decreased to
€ 11.0 bn in 2020. Additionally, operating cash flows from net changes
in operating assets and liabilities decreased by € 3.4 bn to € 21.0 bn.
This was mainly driven by lower reserves for insurance and investment
contracts in our Life/Health business segment in Germany, the United
States and France. Part of the effect was offset by higher net cash
inflows from assets and liabilities held for trading.

Net cash outflow used in investing activities increased by € 1.2 bn
to € 28.9 bn. The main driver were higher net cash outflows from loans
and advances to banks and customers, mainly at our Life/Health busi-
ness in Germany, Allianz SE and the United States. This was partly com-
pensated by lower net cash outflows from financial assets and liabili-
ties designated at fair value through income, especially in our
Life/Health business in Germany and in our Property-Casualty rein-
surance business.

Net cash outflow used in financing activities amounted to
€ 14 bn, compared to € 4.9 bn in 2019. This development was largely
driven by higher net cash inflows from our refinancing activities —
including the issuance of a dual tranche RT1 bond and lower net cash
outflows from transactions between equity holders, in particular from
the Allianz SE share buy-back program.

Cash and cash equivalents increased by € 1.4 bn. This figure
includes € 0.3 bn cash and cash equivalents reclassified to assets of
disposal groups held for sale which were disposed of in 2020.

RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT

Target and strategy of risk management

Allianz aims to ensure that the Group is adequately capitalized at all
times and that all related undertakings at least meet their respective
regulatory capital requirements for the benefit of both shareholders
and policyholders.

In addition, we take the requirements of rating agencies into
account. While capital requirements imposed by regulators constitute
a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies’ capital requirements
and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic business objectives
of the Allianz Group.

We closely monitor the capital position and risk concentrations of
the Group and its related undertakings and apply regular stress tests
(including standardized, historical, and reverse stress test scenarios as
well as monthly stress and scenario analyses focusing on current and
possible future developments). These analyses allow us to take appro-
priate measures to preserve our continued capital and solvency
strength. For example, the risk capital reflecting the risk profile and the
cost of capital being an important aspect which is considered in busi-
ness decisions. Furthermore, we ensure a close alignment of the risk
and business strategy by the fact that business decisions to achieve our
set targets are taken within the determined risk appetite and in line
with the risk strategy. The implemented sound processes to steer the
business and assess and manage associated risks ensure a continuous
alignment of the risk and business strategy and enable us to detect
and address any potential deviations.

In addition, our liquidity risk management framework ensures that
all legal entities in scope are responsible for managing their liquidity
risks and maintaining a sufficient liquidity position under both market
conditions (expected as well as stressed) and business conditions.

Risk governance system

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

As a provider of financial services, we consider risk management to be
a core competency and an integral part of our business. Our risk man-
agement framework covers all operations and subsidiaries within the
Group in proportion to the inherent risks of their activities, ensuring that
risks across the Group are consistently identified, analyzed, assessed,
and adequately managed. The key elements of our risk management
framework are:

— Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a
robust risk governance structure.

— Consistent and proportional application of an integrated risk cap-
ital framework to protect our capital base and support effective
capital management.

— Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into manage-
ment and decision-making processes by attributing risk and allo-
cating capital to business segments, products, and strategies.

84

Our risk management system is based on the following four pillars:

— Risk identification and underwriting: A robust system of risk identi-
fication and underwriting forms the foundation for adequate risk
management decisions. Supporting activities include standards
for underwriting, valuation methods, individual transaction and
new product approvals, emerging-/operational-/top-risk assess-
ments, liquidity risk and scenario analyses, amongst others.

— Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk
appetite consistent with our business strategy. It ensures that
rewards are appropriate based on the taken risks and the required
capital. It also ensures that delegated decision-making bodies are
in line with our overall risk-bearing capacity and strategy.

— Risk reporting and monitoring: Our comprehensive qualitative
and quantitative risk monitoring and reporting framework pro-
vides management with the transparency needed to assess
whether our risk profile remains within the approved limits and to
identify emerging issues and risks quickly. For example, risk dash-
board and limit utilization reports as well as scenario analyses and
stress tests are regularly prepared and communicated.

— Communication and transparency: Transparent risk disclosure
provides the basis for communicating our strategy and perfor-
mance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustain-
able positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strength-
ens the risk awareness and risk culture throughout the entire
Group.

OUR STRATEGY

OUR BUSINESS ASPIRATIONS

The Board of Management of Allianz SE has defined the following
objectives for Allianz Group’s medium-term strategy with the motto
“Simplicity wins”:

— Outperform: We seek to move ahead of our competitors, both tra-
ditional businesses and disruptors.

— Transform: We seek to become simpler and deeply digital and to
make our businesses more scalable.

—  Rebalance: We seek to build leading positions in large, profitable,
and fast-growing geographies as well as in new areas of business.

These objectives have been translated into clear ambitions for the
period 2019 - 2021. With regard to financial performance, we strive
for a return on equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds) of
more than 13%, while growing our earnings per share at a compound
annual growth rate of more than 5% (baseline full year 2018).

To ensure the sustainability of our performance, we have set our-
selves non-financial health targets: For customer loyalty, our ambition
is for more than 75% of the business segments of our entities to be or
become rated by their customers as a loyalty leader or above-market
in terms of Net Promoter Score (NPS). In terms of employee engage-
ment, our ambition is to have the Inclusive Meritocracy Index above
73%. At the same time, we have also set a number of sustainability tar-
gets such as the reduction of our corporate greenhouse gas emissions

Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group


--- Page 26 ---

and the transition of our proprietary investment portfolio to net-zero
emissions by 2050.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated some trends that shape
the insurance markets, while halting others. The altered environment
has reinforced many of our strategic priorities, for example, digital by
default, simplification, and rebalancing of our product portfolios, for
example towards Health and Protection insurance, and the transfor-
mation towards higher resilience and agility.

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY

To implement these strategic objectives, we have defined a number of
strategic priorities, and are implementing initiatives and programs to
address the five dimensions of our Renewal Agenda.

— True Customer Centricity: Design intuitive products and processes
to achieve loyalty leadership in our core markets.

— Digital by Default: Build legacy-free platforms with automated
core processes.

= Technical Excellence: Move to data-driven product design, pricing,
and claims handling.

— Growth Engines: Systematically exploit new sources for profitable
growth.

— Inclusive Meritocracy: Reinforce a culture where both people and
performance matter.

Allianz SE’s Board of Management has also defined a strategy for the
management of risks. This risk strategy places particular emphasis on
protecting the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining solvent even in
the event of extremely adverse scenarios, maintaining sufficient liquid-
ity to meet financial obligations, and providing resilient profitability.

Opportunities

Our financial strength, coupled with ongoing transformation, renders
us resilient and allows us to profit from new opportunities in a fast-
changing business environment as well, for example:

— By combining close customer understanding and evolving data
analytics techniques, we provide superior insurance products and
raise productivity.

- Asa diversified financial group that is active in over 70 countries,
we can innovate locally, then spread ideas and best practices
across the Group in order to exploit economies of scale.

— We seek to grow in fast-growing regions, including Asia-Pacific,
and want to profit from consolidation in developed markets such
as Europe.

— Weare building expertise and business models to benefit from
new risk pools, including cyber risk (insurance, risk mitigation, and
recovery services) and mobility fleets.

— As the world’s population ages, we are improving our offerings in
the retirement savings markets.

In a continuously evolving market where the demands of customers
constantly change, our knowledge of the industry and our expertise in
product development and risk management offers us great
opportunities to create customer-focused solutions. For further details
on opportunities envisaged by the Allianz Group in the various seg-
ments, please refer to Outlook 2021

RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

SUPERVISORY BOARD AND BOARD OF
MANAGEMENT

Allianz Group's approach to risk governance permits integrated man-
agement of local and global risks and ensures that our risk profile
remains consistent with both our risk strategy and our capacity to bear
risks,

Within our risk governance system, the Supervisory Board and
Board of Management of Allianz SE have both Allianz SE and group-
wide responsibilities. The Board of Management formulates business
objectives and a corresponding risk strategy; the core elements of the
risk framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy and
approved by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board
advises, challenges, and supervises the Board of Management in the
execution of its management activities. The following committees sup-
port the Board and the Supervisory Board on risk issues:

Supervisory Board Risk Committee
The Risk Committee reports to the Supervisory Board, where the infor-
mation and the findings are discussed with the Board of Management.
It monitors the effectiveness of the Allianz risk management frame-
work. Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related developments as well as
general risks and specific risk exposures and ensures that the business
strategy is aligned with the risk strategy.

For more information, please refer to the paragraph “Risk Com-
mittee” in the Supervisory Board Report.

Group Finance and Risk Committee

The Group Finance and Risk Committee (GFRC) provides oversight of
the Group's and Allianz SE's risk management framework, acting as a
primary early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz Group's and
Allianz SE's risk profiles as well as the availability of capital. The GFRC
also ensures that an adequate relationship between return and risk is
maintained. Additionally, the GFRC defines risk standards, is the limit-
setting authority within the framework set by the Board of Manage-
ment, and approves major financing and capital management trans-
actions. Finally, the GFRC supports the Board of Management with
recommendations regarding the capital structure, capital allocation,
liquidity position, and investment strategy, including strategic asset
allocation for the different business segments.

Overall risk organization and roles in risk management

A comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved by setting
standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appe-
tite, limit systems, documentation, and reporting. These standards
ensure the accurate and timely flow of risk-related information and a
disciplined approach towards decision-making and execution at both
the global and local levels.

As a general principle, the responsibility for the First Line of
Defense rests with business managers in the related undertaking. They
are responsible for both the risks taken and the returns from their
decisions. The Second Line of Defense is made up of independent
global oversight functions including Risk, Actuarial, Compliance, and
Legal, which support the Board in defining the risk frameworks within
which the business can operate. Group Audit forms the Third Line of
Defense, independently and regularly reviewing risk governance
implementation, compliance with risk principles, performing quality

85


--- Page 27 ---

‘C_Group Management Report

reviews of risk processes, and testing adherence to business standards,
including the internal control framework.

Group Risk management function

Group Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Officer and supports
Allianz SE’s Board of Management, including its committees, by
performing various analyses, communicating risk management
related information and preparing and implementing committee
decisions.

Group Risk also supports the Board of Management in develop-
ing the risk management framework — which covers risk governance,
risk strategy and appetite — and risk monitoring and reporting. Group
Risk’s operational responsibility encompasses assessing risks and
monitoring limits and accumulations of specific risks across business
lines, including natural and man-made disasters and exposures to
financial markets and counterparties.

Group Risk strengthens and maintains the Group’s risk network
through regular and close interaction with the management of related
undertakings and with other key stakeholders such as the local
finance, risk, actuarial, underwriting and investment departments. A
strong group-wide risk network enables the Allianz Group to influence
risk culture across the Group, identify risks at an early stage, and make
management aware of these risks.

Related undertakings

Related undertakings’ are responsible for their own risk management,
including adherence to both external requirements (for example,
those imposed by local regulators) and internal standards. Their
Boards of Management are responsible for setting and approving a
local risk strategy — supporting the Group's risk strategy — during the
annual Strategic and Planning Dialogs with the Group and for ensuring
adherence to their risk strategy.

Arisk function, headed by a Chief Risk Officer which is independ-
ent from business line management, is established by each related
undertaking. A local Risk Committee supports both the Board of Man-
agement and the Chief Risk Officer by acting as the primary risk con-
trolling body.

Consistent implementation of the Group’s risk management
framework in the related undertakings, including regular dialog
between the Group and the entity, is ensured, for example, through
Group Risk representation on local Risk Committees and through reg-
ular assessment of the appropriateness of the local risk management
framework and performance of the Chief Risk Officers by Group Risk.
Moreover, the Group Chief Risk Officer must be consulted on decisions
regarding the staffing, objectives, and performance evaluation of lo-
cal Chief Risk Officers.

Other functions and bodies
In addition to Group Risk and the local risk functions, legal, compli-
ance, and actuarial functions established at both the Group and the
entity levels constitute additional components of the Second Line of
Defense.

Group Legal and Group Compliance seek to mitigate legal risks
with support from other departments. The objectives of both functions

{Related undertakings re also refered to as operating entities.

are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to react appro-
priately to all impending legislative changes or new court rulings, to
attend to legal disputes and litigation, and to provide legally appro-
priate solutions for transactions and business processes. In addition,
Group Compliance — in conjunction with Group Legal and other
experts involved — is responsible for integrity management, which
aims to protect the Allianz Group as well as our related undertakings
and employees from regulatory risks.

Group Actuarial, Planning and Controlling contributes towards
assessing and managing risks in line with regulatory requirements, in
particular for those risks whose management requires actuarial exper-
tise. The range of tasks includes, amongst others, the calculation and
monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial assistance in
business planning, reporting and monitoring of the results, and sup-
porting the effective implementation of the risk management system.

Risk-based steering and risk management

The Allianz Group is exposed to a variety of risks through its core insur-
ance and asset management activities, including market, credit,
underwriting, business, operational, strategic, liquidity, and reputa-
tional risks.

As an integrated financial services provider, we consider diversifi-
cation across different business segments and regions to be an
important element in managing our risks efficiently, as it limits the eco-
nomic impact of any single event and contributes to relatively stable
results. Our aim is to maintain a balanced risk profile without any
disproportionately large risk concentrations and accumulations.

With Solvency II being the regulatory regime relevant for the
Group as of 1 January 2016, our risk profile is measured and steered
based on our approved Solvency Il internal model’. We have intro-
duced a target solvency ratio range in accordance with Solvency II,
based on pre-defined stress scenarios for both the Group and related
undertakings, supplemented by ad-hoc scenarios, historical and
reverse stress tests, and sensitivity analyses.

In addition, central elements of Allianz‘s dividend policy are linked
to Solvency II capitalization based on the internal model. This helps us
to ensure a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization in line
with the Solvency II framework.

Allianz steers its portfolio taking a comprehensive view at risk and
return, which is based on the internal model and is supported by sce-
nario analyses. Risk and concentrations are actively restricted by limits
based on our internal model, and there is a comprehensive analysis of
the return on risk capital? (RoRC). The RoRC is a new business indicator
that allows us to identify profitable lines of new business and products
on a sustainable basis, reflecting the capital commitment over the life
time of the products, and is a key criterion for capital allocation deci-
sions.

As a consequence, the internal model is fully integrated in busi-
ness steering, and its application satisfies the so-called “use test”
requirement, under Solvency II.

MARKET RISK

As an inherent part of our insurance operations, we collect premiums
from our policyholders and invest them in a wide variety of assets; the
resulting investment portfolios back the future claims payments and
benefits to our customers. In addition, we also invest shareholders’ cap-
ital, which is required to support the business. Finally, we use deriva-
tives, mostly to hedge our portfolio against adverse market move-
ments (for example, protective puts) or to reduce our reinvestment risk
(for example, by using forwards, swaps, or swaptions). Asset/liability
management (ALM) decisions are taken based on the internal model,
considering both the risks and the returns on the financial market.

As the fair values of our investment portfolios and liabilities
depend on the changes observed in the financial markets, we are
exposed to the risk of adverse financial market developments. The
long-dated liabilities in our Life/Health business segment and those
attributable to internal pensions contribute to interest rate risk, in par-
ticular when they cannot be fully matched by available investments
due to long maturities. In addition, we are also exposed to adverse
changes in equity and real estate prices, credit spread levels, inflation,
implied volatilities, and currencies, which might impact the value of our
portfolios.

To measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models! for
the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to
generate possible future market developments. After the scenarios for
all the risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions are
revalued under each scenario. The worst-case outcome of the sorted
portfolio profit and loss distribution at a certain confidence level
(99.5%) defines the market Value at Risk (VaR). For entities modeled
using the standard formula, the market risk is based on aggregating
the losses under specified standard formula shock scenarios.

Strategic asset allocation benchmarks and risk limits, including
financial VaR, stand-alone interest rate and equity sensitivity limits,
and foreign exchange exposure limits, are defined for both the Group
and related undertakings. Limits are closely monitored and, if a breach
occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include escala-
tion to the respective decision-making bodies and/or the closing of
positions. Furthermore, we have put in place standards for hedging
activities, due to the exposure to fair-value options embedded in our
life insurance products. Finally, guidelines are provided by the Group
regarding certain investments, new investment products, and the use
of derivatives. Compliance with these guidelines is controlled by the
respective risk and controlling functions.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Allianz is a liability-driven investor. We may suffer an economic loss in
the event of falling interest rates as we reinvest maturing assets at
lower rates prior to the maturity of liability contracts, if the duration of
our assets is shorter than our liabilities. This risk is higher for long-dated
life investment and savings products as well as for internal pensions,
with a significant part of the Life/Health business segment’s interest
rate risk coming from Western Europe, mainly from traditional life in-
surance products with guarantees. Conversely, opportunities may arise
when interest rates increase, as this may result in returns from reinvest-
ments being higher than the guaranteed rates. Interest rate risk is man-
aged within our asset/liability management process and controlled via

{Internal pensions are evaluated and modeled based on deterministic models, following IAS 19 principles.

C_Group Management Report

interest rate sensitivity and duration mismatch limits for the Group and
the local entities.

INFLATION RISK

As an insurance company, we are exposed to changing inflation rates,
predominantly due to our Non-Life insurance obligations but also due
to inflation-indexed internal pension obligations. While inflation
assumptions are taken into account in our product development and
pricing, unexpected rising rate of inflation will increase both future
claims and expenses, leading to higher liabilities; conversely, if future
inflation rates were to be lower than assumed, liabilities would be
lower than anticipated. The risk of changing inflation rates is incorpo-
rated in our internal model.

EQUITY RISK

The Group's insurance-focused operating entities may hold equity
investments to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of ex-
pected long-term returns. Strategic asset allocation benchmarks, in-
vestment and equity sensitivity limits are used to monitor and manage
these exposures. In addition, equity investments fall within the scope of
the credit risk platform to avoid single-name risk concentrations. Risks
from changes in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing
share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As stock markets
might also increase, opportunities may arise from equity investments
in those events.

CREDIT SPREAD RISK

Fixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads
widen. However, our risk appetite for credit spread risk takes into
account the underlying economics of our business model: As a liability-
driven investor, we typically hold fixed-income assets until maturity.
This implies that we are less affected economically by short-term
changes in market prices. In our capacity as a long-term investor, this
gives us the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the
risk-free return and earning this additional yield component.

CURRENCY RISK

Our operating entities typically invest in assets which are denominated
in the same currency as their liabilities. However, some foreign currency
exposures are allowed to support portfolio diversification and tactical
investment decisions. Our largest exposure to foreign currency risk
comes from our ownership of non-Euro entities: Whenever the Euro
strengthens, the Euro equivalent net asset value of our foreign sub-
sidiaries will decline from a Group perspective; however, at the same
time the capital requirements in Euro will decrease, partially mitigating
the total impact on Group capitalization. Based on our foreign
exchange management limit framework, currency risk is monitored
and managed at both the local and Group level.

REAL ESTATE RISK
Despite the risk of decreasing real estate values, real estate is a suita-
ble addition to our investment portfolio due to good diversification
benefits as well as to the contribution of relatively predictable, long-
term cash flows.

Allianz’s Group Investment Committee has defined a framework
for standard transactions for real estate equity and commercial real

87

‘C_Group Management Report

estate loan investments. These standards outline diversification tar-
gets, minimum-return thresholds, and other qualitative and quantita-
tive requirements. All transactions that do not meet these standards or
have a total investment volume (including costs) exceeding a
defined threshold must be reviewed individually by Group Risk and
other Group center functions. In addition, all applicable limits must be
respected, in particular those resulting from strategic asset allocation
as wellas its leeways and risk limits, with regards to an investing entity's
portfolio.

CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of
our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quality
of our counterparties (“migration risk”) or the inability or unwillingness
of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations (“default risk”).

The Group's credit risk profile originates from three sources: our invest-
ment portfolio, our credit insurance business, and our external reinsur-
ance.

— Investment portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in
fixed-income bonds, loans, derivatives, cash positions, and receiv-
ables whose value may decrease depending on the credit quality
of the obligor. However, losses due to credit events can be shared
with the policyholder for certain life insurance products.

— Credit insurance: Credit risk arises from potential claim payments
on limits granted by Euler Hermes to its policyholders. Euler
Hermes insures its policyholders against credit risk associated with
short-term trade credits advanced to policyholder’s clients. When
the client of the policyholder is unable to meet its payment obliga-
tions, Euler Hermes indemnifies the loss to the policyholder.

— Reinsurance: Credit risk arises from potential losses from non-
recoverability of reinsurance receivables or due to default on ben-
efits under in-force reinsurance treaties. Our reinsurance partners
are carefully selected by a dedicated team. Besides focusing on
companies with strong credit profiles, we may also require letters
of credit, cash deposits, or other financial measures to further
mitigate our exposure to credit risk.

The internal credit risk capital model takes into account the major
determinants of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at
default, rating, seniority, collateral, and maturity. Additional parame-
ters assigned to obligors are migration probabilities and obligor asset
correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are
assigned to single obligors using a clearly defined assignment process.
Central components of this assignment process are long-term ratings
from external rating agencies, and internal rating models in case of
specific internal investment strategies. If available, a dynamic adjust-
ment using market-implied ratings and the most recent qualitative
information available is applied.

The loss profile of a given portfolio is obtained using a Monte
Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and exposure
concentrations per obligor segment. The loss profiles are calculated at
different levels of the Allianz Group, and then fed into the internal
model at each level for further aggregation across sources of risk to
derive diversified credit risk.

‘Credit Rsk Platform
2 Property-Casuaty is also refered to as Non-Life

Our credit insurance portfolio is modeled by Euler Hermes, based
on a proprietary model component which is a local adaptation of the
central internal credit risk model. Euler Hermes’ loss profile is inte-
grated in the Group's internal credit risk model to capture the concen-
tration and diversification effects.

To ensure effective credit risk management, credit VaR limits are
derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket
benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the
lower investment-grade and non-investment-grade area

Our group-wide country and obligor group limit management
framework (CRisP*) allows us to manage counterparty concentration
risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the Group and oper-
ating-entity levels. This limit framework forms the basis for discussions
on credit actions and provides notification services featuring the quick
and broad communication of credit-related decisions across the
Group.

Clearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations
and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed. The
setting of country and obligor exposure limits from the Group's per-
spective (i.e, the maximum concentration limit) takes into account the
Allianz Group's portfolio size and structure as well as our overall risk
strategy.

UNDERWRITING RISK

Underwriting risk consists of premium and reserve risks in the Property-
Casualty? business segment as well as biometric risks in the
Life/Health? business segment. Underwriting risks are not relevant for
the Asset Management business segment and our banking opera-
tions.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

Our Property-Casualty insurance businesses are exposed to premium-
risk-related adverse developments in the current year’s new and
renewed business as well as to reserve risks related to the business in
force.

Premium risk

As part of our Property-Casualty business operations, we receive pre-
miums from our customers and provide insurance protection in return
Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the business in the current
year develop adversely relative to expected claims ratios. Premium risk
can be mitigated by reinsurance as well as by technical excellence in
underwriting. Assessing risks as part of the underwriting process is
therefore a key element of our risk management framework. There are
clear underwriting limits and restrictions which are defined centrally
and applied across the Group.

Premium risk is subdivided into three categories: natural catastro-
phe risk, terror risk, and non-catastrophe risk including man-made
catastrophes.

Premium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are
used to derive loss distributions. Non-catastrophe risks are modeled
using frequency and severity models for large losses and aggregate
loss distribution models for attritional losses. Natural disasters such as
earthquakes, storms, and floods represent a significant challenge for
risk management due to their high accumulation potential for higher
return periods. For natural catastrophe risks, we use special modeling

3 Life/Heatth is also referred to os Life

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group


--- Page 30 ---

techniques which combine portfolio data (geographic location, char-
acteristics of insured objects, and their values) with simulated natural
disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of poten-
tial losses. Where such stochastic models do not exist, we use deter-
ministic, scenario-based approaches to estimate potential losses. Sim-
ilar approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations for terror and
man-made catastrophes, including losses from cyber incidents and in-
dustrial concentrations.

These loss distributions are then used within the internal model to
calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.

Reserve risk

Reserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in best-
estimate reserves over a one-year time horizon, resulting from fluctu-
ations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement. We estimate
and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events that have not
yet been settled. In case of unexpected developments, we would ex-
perience a reserve gain or loss dependent on the assumptions applied
for the estimate.

Similar to premium risk, reserve risk is calculated based on actu-
arial models. The reserve distributions derived are then used within the
internal model to calculate potential losses based on a predefined
confidence level of 99.5 %.

In order to reduce the risk of unexpected reserve volatility, our
operating entities constantly monitor the development of reserves for
insurance claims on a line-of-business level. In addition, operating
entities generally conduct annual reserve uncertainty analyses based
onsimilar methods used for reserve risk calculations. The Allianz Group
performs regular independent reviews of these analyses and Group
representatives participate in the local reserve committee meetings.

LIFE/HEALTH

Underwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks)
include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality,
disability, and morbidity risks are associated with an unexpected
increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims. Lon-
gevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and group
pension products might not be sufficient due to longer life expectan-
cies of the insured.

Life/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower
than expected. As profitability calculations are based on several
parameters — such as historical loss information and assumptions on
inflation, mortality, or morbidity — realized parameters may differ from
the ones used for underwriting. For example, higher-than-expected
inflation may lead to higher medical claims in the future. However,
beneficial deviations are also possible; for example, a lower morbidity
rate than expected will most likely result in lower claims in income pro-
tection products.

We measure these risks within our internal model, distinguishing,
where appropriate, between risks affecting the absolute level and
trend development of the actuarial assumptions on the one hand and
pandemic risk scenarios on the other. Depending on the nature and
complexity of the risks involved, our health business is represented in
the internal model according to Property-Casualty or Life/Health cal-
culation methods and is therefore included in the relevant Property-
Casualty and Life/Health figures accordingly. However, most of our
health business is attributable to the Life/Health business segment.

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group

C_Group Management Report

BUSINESS RISK

Business risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks. They
are mostly driven by the Life/Health business and to a lesser extent by
the Property-Casualty business. Cost risks are associated with the risk
that expenses incurred in administering policies are higher than
expected or that new business volume decreases to a level that does
not allow Allianz to absorb its fixed costs. Business risk is measured
relative to baseline plans.

For the Life/Health business, policyholder behavior risks are risks
related to unpredictable, adverse behavior of policyholders in
exercising their contractual options, such as, for instance, early termi-
nation of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals, and
annuity take-up options.

Assumptions on policyholder behavior are set in line with ac-
cepted actuarial methods and based on own historical data, where
available. If there is no historical data, assumptions are based on
industry data or expert judgment. It is used as a basis to determine the
economic impact of policyholder behavior under different scenarios
within our internal model.

OPERATIONAL RISK

Operational risks refer to losses resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, human errors, system failures, and external events,
and can stem from a wide variety of sources, including the following:

— “Clients, Products & Business Practices”: potential losses due to a
failure to meet the professional obligations or from the design of
products. Examples include misselling, non-compliance with inter-
nal or external requirements related to products, anti-trust behav-
ior, data protection, sanctions and embargoes, etc. These losses
tend to be less frequent but, when they occur, can have high finan-
cial impact.

— “Execution, Delivery and Process Management”: potential losses
arising from transaction or process management failures. Exam-
ples include interest and penalties from non-payment or under-
payment of taxes or losses associated with broker and agent dis-
tribution processes. These losses tend to be of a relatively higher
frequency but with little financial impact (although single large-
loss events can occur).

— Other operational risks including, for example, internal or external
fraud, financial misstatement risk, a cyber security incident causing
business disruption or fines, a potential failure at our outsourcing
partners causing a disruption to our working environment, etc.

The Group's operational risk capital is dominated (by more than 80 %)
by the risk of potential losses within the categories “Clients, Products,
and Business Practices” and “Execution, Delivery, and Process Man-
agement”. With regard to the largest category “Clients, Products, and
Business Practices’, key external drivers are changes in laws and regu-
lations. Internal drivers reflect potential failures of internal processes.
These drivers are considered in the local scenario analyses.
Operational risk capital is calculated using a scenario-based
approach based on expert judgment as well as internal and external
operational loss data. The estimates for frequency and severity of
potential loss events for each material operational risk category are
assessed and used as a basis for our internal model calibration.
Allianz has developed a consistent operational risk management
framework, which is applied across the Group based on

proportionality and focuses on the early recognition and proactive
management of material operational risks. The framework defines
roles and responsibilities as well as management processes and meth-
ods: Local risk managers, in their capacity as Second Line of Defense,
identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control deficien-
cies via a dialog with the First Line of Defense, report operational risk
events in a central database, and ensure that the framework is imple-
mented in their respective operating entity.

This framework triggers specific mitigating control programs. For
example, compliance risks are addressed with written policies and
dedicated compliance programs monitored by the Group Compliance
function at Allianz Group. The risk of financial misstatement is miti-
gated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting.
Outsourcing risks are covered by our Outsourcing Policy, Service Level
Agreements, and Business Continuity and Crisis Management pro-
grams to protect critical business functions from these events. Cyber
risks are mitigated through investments in cyber security, cyber insur-
ance that Allianz buys from third-party insurers, and a variety of ongo-
ing control activities.

OTHER MATERIAL RISKS NOT MODELED IN THE
INTERNAL MODEL

There are risks which, due to their nature, cannot be adequately
addressed or mitigated by setting aside dedicated capital. These risks
are therefore not considered in the internal model. For the identifica-
tion, analysis, assessment, monitoring, and management of these risks
we also use a systematic approach, with risk assessment generally
based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. The most important
of these other risks are strategic, liquidity, and reputational risk.

STRATEGIC RISK
Strategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company’s value that will
arise from adverse management decisions on business strategies and
their implementation.

Strategic risks are identified and evaluated as part of the Group's
Top Risk Assessment process, and discussed in various Board of Man-
agement-level committees (for example, GFRC). We also monitor mar-
ket and competitive conditions, capital market requirements, regula-
tory conditions, etc., to decide if strategic adjustments are necessary.

The most important strategic risks are directly addressed through
Allianz’s Renewal Agenda, which focuses on five themes: True Cus-
tomer Centricity, Digital by Default, Technical Excellence, Growth
Engines, and Inclusive Meritocracy. Progress on mitigating strategic
risks and meeting the Renewal Agenda objectives is monitored and
evaluated in the course of the Strategic and Planning Dialogs between
Allianz Group and the related undertakings.

LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that current or future payment obli-
gations cannot be met or can only be met on the basis of adversely
altered conditions. Liquidity risk can arise primarily if there are mis-
matches in the timing of cash in- and out-flows.

Each legal entity of Allianz Group manages liquidity risk
locally, using asset/liability management systems designed to ensure
that assets and liabilities are adequately matched. Local investment

ermance and decision-making processes at the Allianz Group.

strategies particularly focus on the quality of the investments and en-
sure a significant portion of liquid assets (for example, high-rated gov-
ernment bonds or covered bonds) in the portfolios. In the course of
liquidity planning, liquidity sources (for example, cash from invest-
ments and premiums) and liquidity needs (for example, payments due
to insurance claims and expenses) are reconciled under a best-esti-
mate plan, as well as under adverse idiosyncratic and systemic liquidity
scenarios, to allow for a group-wide consistent view on liquidity risk.
These analyses are performed at legal entity level and are monitored
by the Group.

An identical liquidity stress-testing framework is applied at
Allianz SE. Major contingent liquidity requirements arise mainly from
market risk scenarios for Allianz SE and its subsidiaries, from the non-
availability of external capital markets, and from reinsurance risk sce-
narios for Allianz SE.

In addition, the cash position of the Group cash pool investment
portfolio is monitored and forecast on a daily basis and is subject to an
absolute minimum liquidity threshold and an absolute target liquidity
threshold. Both thresholds are defined for the Allianz SE cash pool in
order to be protected against short-term liquidity crises.

The liquidity planning process addresses future potential liquidity
needs and aims to manage available liquidity sources in an efficient
and effective manner. The annual and high-level three-year cash flow
plan for Allianz SE and the Holding and Treasury reportable segment
of Allianz SE reflects the overall operating, financing, and investing
strategy of Allianz Group. The annual liquidity plan for Allianz SE and
for the Holding and Treasury reportable segment is subject to the ap-
proval of the Board of Management. Liquidity planning is constantly
monitored and regularly reported to the Board of Management via
GFRC.

REPUTATIONAL RISK

Allianz’s reputation as a well-respected and socially aware provider of
financial services is influenced by our behavior in a range of areas such
as product quality, corporate governance, financial performance, cus-
tomer service, employee relations, intellectual capital, and corporate
responsibility.

Reputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of
the Allianz SE share price, the value of the in-force business, or the
value of future business caused by a decline in our reputation in inter-
nal or external stakeholders’ judgment.

The identification and assessment of reputational risks is part of
the annual Top Risk Assessment process. As part of this process, senior
management approves the risk management strategy for the most
significant risks facing the company, including those with a potentially
severe reputational impact.

The management of Environmental, Social and Governance
(ESG) risks — which are closely related to reputational risk — is sup-
ported by a dedicated Group ESG Board and Group ESG Office’, which
help steer the integration of ESG aspects into core investment and
insurance activities. Significant ESG and other reputational risks iden-
tified in the course of business are escalated to experts from Group
Communications and Corporate Responsibility?, Group Risk, and

sibility. As of 1 January 2021, Alinz’s ESG agenda will be managed by a new Global Sustainability function and Group

CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change has the potential to materially affect the global econ-
omy and our business, especially in the long run. Risks arising from cli-
mate change can be seen already today and their relevance will in-
crease over the mid- and long-term. These can for instance be acute
and chronic physical risks such as warming temperatures, extreme
weather events, rising sea levels, intensifying heatwaves and droughts,
or a change in vector-borne diseases, with impacts on property or
health. The risks also result from the cross-sectoral structural change
stemming from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. These
include changes in climate policy, technology, or market sentiment,
and impact thereof on the market value of financial assets as well as
impact resulting from climate change litigation

Climate change also creates opportunities — be it in connection
with financing a low-carbon and climate-resilient future, e.g., by invest-
ing in renewable energy, energy efficiency in real estate, and electric
vehicle infrastructure —, or by providing insurance solutions to protect
against physical climate impacts and to support low-carbon business
models.

Climate change impacts Allianz’s business in two key ways:

— Firstly, through insurance policies e.g., covering health impacts,
property damage, and other losses, and

— Secondly, through changes in the sectors and business models it
underwrites.

Furthermore, Allianz is affected by climate change as a large-scale in-
stitutional investor. It has significant stakes in various economies, com-
panies, infrastructure, and real estate that might be affected by the
physical impact of climate change and by the transition to a low-car-
bon economy. This can directly influence the ability of assets to gener-
ate long-term value.

We address immediate risks from climate change factors follow-
ing the management approach for the primary underlying risks e.g.,
building on our long-term expertise in the modeling of extreme
weather events or analyzing emission profiles of our proprietary invest-
ments. On a forward-looking basis, we consider risks from climate
change factors under emerging risks, where we closely monitor the de-
velopment of the risk landscape supported by selective analyses on
our portfolios.

Internal risk capital framework

We define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us
against unexpected, extreme economic losses, and which forms the
basis for determining our Solvency Il regulatory capitalization. On a
quarterly basis, we calculate and consistently aggregate internal risk
capital across all business segments. We also project risk capital re-
quirements regularly between reporting periods in times of financial
market turbulence.

GENERAL APPROACH

For the management of our risk profile and solvency position, we utilize
an approach that reflects the Solvency II rules in that it comprises our
approved internal model covering all major insurance operations.
Other entities are reflected based on standard formula results, others
under the deduction and aggregation approach as well as on sectoral
or local requirements for non-insurance operations, in accordance with
the Solvency I! framework.

INTERNAL MODEL

Our internal model is based on a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo
simulation. Following this approach, we determine the maximum loss
in portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe
(“holding period”, set at one year) and probability of occurrence (“con-
fidence level”, set at 99.5%). We simulate risk events from all risk cate-
gories (“sources of risk”) modeled and calculate the portfolio value
based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including risk-mit-
igating measures such as reinsurance contracts or derivatives, under
each scenario,

The risk capital required is defined as the difference between the
current portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse condi-
tions at the 99.5% confidence level. As we consider the impacts of a
negative or positive event on all risk sources and covered businesses at
the same time, diversification effects across products and regions are
taken into account. The results of our Monte Carlo simulation allow us
to analyze our exposure to each source of risk both separately and in
aggregate. We also analyze several pre-defined stress scenarios rep-
resenting historical events, reverse stress tests, and adverse scenarios
relevant for our portfolio. Furthermore, we conduct ad-hoc stress tests
on a monthly basis to reflect current political and financial develop-
ments and to analyze specific non-financial risks more closely.

COVERAGE OF THE RISK CAPITAL CALCULATIONS

The Allianz Group's internal model to calculate our Solvency Capital
Requirement (SCR) covers all major insurance operations?. This
includes both relevant assets (including fixed-income, equities, real
estate, and derivatives) and liabilities (including the run-off of all cur-
rent and planned technical provisions as well as deposits, issued debt
and other liabilities). For with-profit products in the Life/Health busi-
ness segment, the options and guarantees embedded in insurance
contracts — including policyholder behavior — are taken into account.

Smaller related undertakings in the European Economic Area
which are not covered by the internal model are reflected with their
standard formula results. At the Group level, the Solvency Capital
Requirements for smaller insurance undertakings outside the Euro-
pean Economic Area with only immaterial impact on the Group's risk
profile are accounted for by means of book value deduction.”

Risk capital related to our European banking operations is allo-
cated to the Corporate and Other business segment and calculated
based on the approach applied by banks in accordance with the local
requirements resulting from the Basel regulation (Basel standards). As
the capital requirement for the banking business is only approximately
0.8% (2019: 0.9%) of our total pre-diversified Group Solvency Capital
Requirement, risk management for the banking operations is not dis-
cussed in greater detail.

2_Under book value deduction, the book value of the respective entity is deducted from eligible Own Funds of the Group.

‘C_Group Management Report

For our Asset Management business segment, we assign internal
risk capital requirements based on sectoral regulatory capital require-
ments. The Asset Management business is affected mainly by opera-
tional risks. However, since most of our Asset Management business is
not located in the Eurozone, at Group level its participation value
bears a foreign exchange rate risk. Our Asset Management business is
covered by adequate risk controlling processes, including qualitative
risk assessments (such as Top Risk Assessment) set up by the respective
entities, with key results regularly reported to the Group. As the impact
on the Group's total Solvency Capital Requirement is minor, risk man-
agement with respect to Asset Management is not discussed in greater
detail.

In view of the above, Allianz’s risk capital framework covers all
material and quantifiable risks. Risks not specifically covered by the
internal model include strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.

ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

RISK-FREE RATE AND VOLATILITY ADJUSTMENT

When calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities, the assump-
tions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial in deter-
mining and discounting future cash flows. For liability valuation, we
apply the methodology provided by the European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) as part of its technical docu-
mentation (EIOPA-BoS-20/109) to extrapolate the risk-free interest
rate curves beyond the last liquid tenor

In addition, we adjust the risk-free yield curves by a volatility
adjustment (VA) in most markets where a volatility adjustment is de-
fined by EIOPA and approved by the local regulator. This is done to
better reflect the underlying economics of our business, as the cash
flows of our insurance liabilities are largely predictable. The advantage
of being a long-term investor is the opportunity to invest in bonds yield-
ing spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield
component over the duration of the bonds. Being a long-term investor
mitigates much of the risk of having to sell debt instruments at a loss
prior to maturity.

We take account of this by applying the volatility adjustment to
mitigate the credit spread risk, which we consider to be less meaningful
for long-term investors than the default risk. Allianz also models the
volatility adjustment dynamically within our approved internal model,
which differs from the static EIOPA VA concept applied in the standard
formula. For risk capital calculations, we assume a dynamic movement
of the volatility adjustment broadly consistent with the way the VA
would react in practice; however, we base the movement on our own.
portfolio rather than the EIOPA portfolio. To account for this deviation,
Allianz applies a more conservative, reduced application ratio for the
dynamic volatility adjustment. Validation is performed regularly to
verify the appropriateness and prudency of the approach.

VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS: REPLICATING
PORTFOLIOS

We replicate the liabilities of our Life/Health insurance business. This
technique enables us to represent all
guarantees, both contractual and discretionary, by means of standard

product-related options and

financial instruments. In the risk calculation, we use the replicating
portfolio - together with a Least Square Monte Carlo approach for

risks that are not covered by the replication — to determine and revalue
these liabilities under all potentially adverse Monte Carlo scenarios.

DIVERSIFICATION AND CORRELATION ASSUMPTIONS
Our internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and corre-
lation effects when aggregating results at the Group level. The result-
ing diversification reflects the fact that all potential worst-case losses
are not likely to materialize at the same time. As we are an integrated
financial services provider offering a variety of products across differ-
ent business segments and geographic regions, diversification is key to
our business model.

Diversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks
that are not, or only partly, interdependent. Important diversification
factors include regions (for example, windstorm in Australia vs. wind-
storm in Germany), risk categories (for example, market risk vs. under-
writing risk), and subcategories within the same risk category (for ex-
ample, commercial vs. personal lines of property and casualty risk). Ul-
timately, diversification is driven by the specific features of the invest-
ment or insurance products in question and their respective risk expo-
sures. For example, an operational risk event at an Australian entity
can be considered to be highly independent of a change in credit
spreads for a French government bond held by a German entity.

Where possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair of
market risks through statistical analysis of historical data, considering
observations over more than a decade. In case historical data or other
portfolio-specific observations are insufficient or unavailable, correla-
tions are set by the Correlation Settings Committee, which combines
the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-defined and con-
trolled process. In general, when using expert judgment we set the cor-
relation parameters to represent the joint movement of risks under
adverse conditions. Based on these correlations, we use an industry-
standard approach, the Gaussian copula, to determine the depend-
ency structure of quantifiable sources of risk within the applied Monte
Carlo simulation.

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

Our internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liability
inflation, mortality, longevity, morbidity, policyholder behavior,
expense, etc. We use our own internal historical data for actuarial
assumptions wherever possible, additionally considering recommen-
dations from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, and actu-
arial associations. The derivation of our actuarial assumptions is based
on generally accepted actuarial methods. Within our internal risk cap-
ital and financial reporting framework, comprehensive processes and
controls exist for ensuring the reliability of these assumptions.

MODEL LIMITATIONS

As the internal model is based on a 99.5% confidence level, there is a
low statistical probability of 0.5% that actual losses could exceed this
threshold at the Group level in the course of one year.

We use model and scenario parameters derived from historical
data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If
future market conditions were to differ substantially from the past, for
example, in an unprecedented crisis, our VaR approach might be too
conservative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict. In order

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group


--- Page 34 ---

to mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR anal-
ysis with stress testing.

Furthermore, we validate the model and parameters through sen-
sitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews, and, where appro-
priate, independent external reviews, focusing on methods for select-
ing parameters and control processes. To ensure that the model is val-
idated adequately, we have established an Independent Validation
Unit (IVU) within Group Risk, responsible for validating our internal
model within a comprehensive model validation process. Any limita-
tions identified during the validation process are remedied after con-
sultation with the Group regulator. Overall, we believe that our valida-
tion efforts are effective and that the model adequately assesses the
risks to which we are exposed.

The construction and application of the replicating portfolios
mentioned are subject to the set of replicating instruments that are
available and might be too simple or restrictive to capture all factors
affecting the change in value of liabilities. As with other model compo-
nents, the replication framework is subject to independent validation
and to suitability assessments as well as to stringent data and process
quality controls. Therefore, we believe that our liabilities are ade-
quately represented by the replicating portfolios.

Since the internal model takes into account the change in the eco-
nomic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to estimate the
market value of each item accurately. For some assets and liabilities it
may be difficult, if not impossible — notably in distressed financial
markets — to either obtain a current market price or apply a meaning-
ful mark-to-market approach. For such assets we apply a mark-to-

C_Group Management Report

model approach. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of their val-
ues also depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow estimates.
Despite these limitations, we believe the estimated fair values are ap-
propriately assessed,

REGULATORY AND MODEL CHANGES IN 2020

In 2020, our internal model was further enhanced based on regulatory
developments, model validation results, and the feedback received in
the course of our consultations with regulators.

The net impact of regulatory and model changes on the Sol-
vency II risk capital of the Group in 2020 was € (0.6) bn. This reduction
in SCR is mainly driven by the introduction of several minor and imma-
terial model changes at both the Group and entity levels and the im-
plementation of the final aspects of the cross-effect model change.
Cross-effects are defined as the effects arising due to the interaction
between different risk categories and/or risk types. This is partly offset
by impacts of the regulatory change of a reduction in the ultimate for-
ward rate (UFR) and the refinement of the calibration of equity volatil-
ity. The change in the modeling approach for surplus funds of Allianz
Lebensversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft contributed to the significant
reduction of the capital add-on.

In all subsequent sections, the figures including model changes
will form the basis for the movement analyses of our risk profile in 2020.
As our general capital steering continues to focus on the Solvency II ra-
tio impacts excluding the application of transitional measures for tech-
nical provisions, the figures in the following table exclude transitional
measures unless specifically stated.

the following risk categories:

MARKET RISK

The overall decrease in market risk especially for the Life/Health busi-
ness segment is mainly driven by the impacts of minor and immaterial
model changes and the cross-effect model change. This is partly com-
pensated by the regulatory change - the reduction in the ultimate for-
ward rate that is mostly allocated to market risk —, the refinement of
calibration of equity volatility, and the modeling of cross-effects in the
surplus funds of Allianz Lebensversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft. The
combined impact on the market risk of Allianz Group was a decrease
of € 0.1 bn to € 25.3 bn (2019: € 25.4 bn).

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group

No material model change was applied to the risk capital model for
credit risk in 2020. However, minor model changes and model updates
in the credit risk model as well as model changes in other risk modules
that affect the credit risk model resulted in a marginal decrease of
credit risk.

driven by minor and immaterial model changes.

CAPITAL ADD-ONS

The decrease of the risk capital requirement of € 0.5 bn is mainly driven
by the reversal of the capital add-on introduced previously to reflect
not modeled cross-effects in the surplus funds of Allianz Lebensver-
sicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft. This add-on is no longer necessary due
to the approach introduced for modeling these cross-effects.

IMPACT OF MODEL CHANGES ON ELIGIBLE GROUP
OWN FUNDS

The regulatory and model changes in 2020 resulted in a €1.0bn
decrease of Own Funds which was mainly driven by the adjustment
of the UFR by -15 basis points and the model changes at Allianz
Lebensversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft and Allianz Private Kranken-
versicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft such as the introduction of a simpli-
fied look-through on asset participations and the implementation of
model changes in cashflow modeling.

IMPACTS OF TRANSITIONAL MEASURES

The application of transitional measures on technical provisions for
Allianz Lebensversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft and Allianz Private
Krankenversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft resulted in an increase in the
SCR of € 66 mn and an increase in the Own Funds of € 13.6 bn at the
Group level.

Allianz risk profile and management assessment

RISK PROFILE AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT
Allianz’s core business as a global insurer and asset manager predom-
inantly exposes it to a variety of risks such as underwriting risks, finan-
cial market and credit risks, and several other non-financial risks (i.e.,
operational, reputational, liquidity, and strategic risks). The execution
of the Renewal Agenda may impact the potential severity or likelihood
of these existing risks, contribute towards concentrations of certain
types of risk, or potentially even give rise to new risks within a given risk
category. However, from a broad perspective, the overall risk profile of
Allianz has remained and is expected to remain stable. “Stable” in this
context means a relatively high exposure to market and credit risks, a
moderate exposure to underwriting risks and a modest exposure to
operational, business, and other risks (i.e., measured as a share of the
Allianz Group's Solvency Il risk capital). Please refer to section
Solvency II regulatory capitalization for further details.

To support the development of a risk appetite and a risk manage-
ment framework for these core risks, the Allianz Group has elaborated
the following risk management philosophy:

— Financial risks: Allianz Group’s ultimate objective is to assure that
financial risk taking is in line with risk bearing capacity at the Group.
and legal entity level and it creates shareholder's equity. To man-
age financial risk effectively and avoid accumulated losses in times
of financial crisis, it is essential to clearly identify, measure, monitor
and control the risks inherent in the investment portfolios and in
insurance products including the development of new products.

— Underwriting risks: Exposures to these risks are required to serve
customers and generate shareholder value. Quality control mech-
anisms are applied to ensure adherence to Allianz’s underwriting
standards and monitor the quality of the portfolio and underwrit-
ing process. The underwriting processes must support sustainable

94

and profitable business, secure consistency, align with the risk
appetite of the Group and of the operating entities as well as
avoid undesired and/or excessive risks and accumulations. The full
economic consequences of a pandemic event such as COVID-19
are uninsurable. The required capital for an effective protection
against such an accumulation of risks would require premium
rates, that are unattractive for the customers, if not unaffordable.
In addition, a pandemic affects multiple factors such as business
interruption, impact on global capital markets, increase in medical
costs, and mortality.

— Other non-financial risks: These risks are inherent to the Group's
core business and need to be carefully managed via continuous
improvements in risk identification, risk assessment and control
environments. This occurs through elements of the Group Risk
management framework such as the Top Risk Assessment (TRA),
Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS), Reputational Risk
Management Framework, and Liquidity Risk Management.

POTENTIAL RISKS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET AND IN
OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

Financial markets are characterized by historically low interest rates
and risk premiums, causing some investors to look for higher-yielding
—and potentially higher-risk — investments. In addition to sustained low
interest rates, the challenges of implementing long-term structural re-
forms in key Eurozone countries, the uncertainty about future mone-
tary and fiscal policies, rising populism, amplified geopolitical tensions
and economic nationalism amid the pandemic, which weigh on global
trade with the potential of prompting long-term structural shifts in
global supply chains may lead to increasing market volatility. The in-
creasing reliance on digital technologies which has been greatly ac-
celerated by the COVID-19 pandemic — to ensure business continuity
and enhance efficiency and competitiveness — increases the risk of
technology obsolescence, cyber-attacks, data breaches, system fail-
ures as well as the risk of non-compliance with increasing regulation
covering IT-related business processes.

The uncertainty around the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic
remains a significant risk. The approval, production, distribution, and
correct administration of the vaccines are critical in alleviating the so-
cial, economic, and financial repercussions of the pandemic. The steps
are subject to a number of challenges such as the efficacy of the vac-
cines, high-quality mass production, potential long-term side effects,
and the willingness of a majority of the population to get vaccinated.
Full economic recovery is not expected to occur until the health con-
cerns are forcefully and credibly addressed, i.e., for herd immunity to be
achieved. Global vaccination is expected to be eventually successful;
however, the timing and progress appear uncertain. Residual risks will
remain such as further virus mutations, emerging side effects, length of
the immunity, or refusal to take vaccines by the majority of the popula-
tion as most authorities do not intend to make vaccination compulsory.
The extended containment (lockdown) measures risk delaying eco-
nomic recovery, with significant credit implications in some industries.
The pace and timing of recovery, the overall economic cost, and credit
implications will depend on an effective transition to post-COVID poli-
cies, as less supportive fiscal packages could hurt employment and the
solvency of small or more exposed businesses.

Another strain is the future relationship between the United King-
dom and the European Union as the Trade and Cooperation Agree-
ment negotiated between them enters into force in 2021.

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group


--- Page 36 ---

Therefore, we continue to closely monitor political and financial
developments as well as the global trade situation to manage our
overall risk profile to specific event risks.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

Our approved internal model has been applied since the beginning of
2016 when Solvency || became effective. There is some uncertainty
about future regulatory requirements resulting from the potential in-
troduction of future global capital requirements and from the cur-
rent Solvency Il review.

The frameworks for potential future capital requirements for Inter-
nationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) and Global Systemically
Important Insurers (G-Slls) are yet to be finalized by the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Financial Stability
Board (FSB).In addition, the European Commission is conducting a re-
view of the Solvency Il directive as foreseen in European legislation.
The review covers an extensive list of topics from a wide variety of ar-
eas, from capital requirements to reporting and on to proportionality,
for which EIOPA provided technical advice to the European Com-
mission in December 2020, suggesting amendments in each area.
Based on this and further input from stakeholders, the European Com-
mission is expected to provide a first legislative proposal by the third
quarter of 2021, followed by trilog negotiations at the European level
before changes to the directive can become effective. Depending on
circumstances, a further transposition into national law will be re-
quired, so that final implementation is not expected before end of
2022. In this context, the Allianz Group is actively participating in dis-
cussions with the European Commission, EIOPA, local regulators, Insur-
ance Europe, and GDV.

Therefore, future Solvency II Capital Requirements might change
depending on the outcome of the 2020 review of the Solvency I! frame-
work by EIOPA. Concrete effects of the Solvency II review for the Group,
however, can only be assessed after final results are available.

Finally, the potential for a multiplicity of different regulatory
regimes, capital standards, and reporting requirements will increase
operational complexity and costs.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

The management feels comfortable with the Group's overall risk
profile, and confident that the effectiveness of its risk management
framework meets both the challenges of a rapidly changing environ-
ment and day-to-day business needs. This confidence is based on
several factors:

— Due to its effective capital management, the Allianz Group is well
capitalized and has metits internal, rating agency, and regulatory
solvency targets as of 31 December 2020. Allianz remains one of
the most highly rated insurance groups in the world, as reflected
by our external ratings.

— The Group has a conservative investment profile and disciplined
business practices in the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Asset
Management business segments, leading to sustainable operat-
ing earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.

- Asa result of COVID-19 pandemic, the Group experienced the
following:

— Losses in the Property-Casualty business segment resulted
from business interruption coverage and accumulations from

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group

C_Group Management Report

the entertainment sector. The Group also lost revenue in the
travel and credit business lines.

— Higher market risk mainly due to the volatility of equity prices
and interest rates. The Group implemented risk mitigating
measures such as equity sales, increasing asset duration, and
the purchase of credit default swap protection

— Elevated reputational risk, as law suits with respect to business
interruption policies could affect our purpose statement
depending on media coverage and public perception. In
addition, increased regulatory pressure can be observed
regarding dividend payments of insurance companies,
premium deferrals, or customer friendly interpretation of
policy cover.

— Business continuity and employer liability remain a focus area.
The implementation of a new work model is key to addressing
employer liability risks resulting from the accelerated trend by
COVID-19 to work from home. This is accompanied with
respective changes in IT risk management.

— Allianz is well positioned to deal with potentially adverse future
events such as the COVID-19 pandemic — due to our strong
internal limit framework, stress testing, internal model, and risk
management practices.

— Finally, the Group has the additional advantage of being well-
diversified, both geographically and across a broad range of
businesses and products.

Based on the information available to us at the moment of report
completion, including the known impacts of COVID-19, we expect the
Group to continue to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with
both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and minimum
consolidated Group Solvency Capital Requirement. However, we are
carefully monitoring the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and
managing our portfolios to ensure that the Group and its entities have
sufficient resources to meet their solvency capital needs.

Allianz Private Krankenversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft. Including
the application of transitional measures for technical provisions, the
Own Funds and SCR as of 31 December 2020 amounted to € 98.5 bn
and € 40.9 bn leading to a Solvency Il ratio of 240 %. Our general

ratio

Compared to year-end 2019, our Solvency II capitalization ratio
declined by 5 percentage points to 207% (2019: 212%) since the
slight increase in Own Funds was overcompensated by the increase of
the Solvency || Capital Requirement. The decrease of the Solvency II
ratio was mainly driven by the COVID-19 triggered negative market
developments ((27) percentage points) especially due to the decline in
interest rates. Taxes and other changes ((8) percentage points) also
contributed negatively. This was partially compensated by operating
Solvency II capital generation and business evolution (23 percentage
points), model changes (1 percentage point), and (capital) manage-
ment actions (7 percentage points). The latter was mostly driven by the
issuance of subordinated debts in May and November 2020 as well as
de-risking measures (e.g., duration management and reduction of
equity exposure). The impacts are partially offset by the executed
share buy-back in the first quarter of 2020, dividend accrual, and M&A
transactions (e.g., acquisition of SulAmerica and Control Expert as well
as the joint venture with BBVA).

This Risk and Opportunity Report outlines the Group's risk figures,
reflecting its risk profile based on pre-diversified risk figures and Group
diversification effects.

At the Allianz Group, we measure and steer risk based on an
approved internal model which quantifies the potential adverse devel-
opments of Own Funds. The results provide an overview of how our risk
profile is distributed over different risk categories, and determine the
regulatory capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II

With the exception of the Asset Management business segment,
all business segments are exposed to the full range of risk categories.
As mentioned earlier, the Asset Management business segment is pre-
dominantly exposed to operational and market risks and to a lesser
extent to credit risk. The risk capital for the Asset Management busi-
ness segment is allocated to sectoral requirement.

The pre-diversified risk figures reflect the diversification effect
within each modeled risk category (i.e., market, credit, underwriting,
business, and operational risk), but do not include the diversification
effects across risk categories. Group diversified risk figures also capture
the diversification effect across all risk categories.

The following sections explain the evolution of our risk profile per mod-
eled risk category. All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis and
concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accordingly.

As of 31 December 2020, the Group-diversified risk capital, which
reflects our risk profile before considering non-controlling interests,
amounted to € 40.9 bn (2019: € 39.5 bn). This represents a slight dec-
rement in the diversification benefit — before tax — of 0.6% to 23.2%.
The increase in Solvency Il Capital Requirement was mainly due to
market impacts driven by adverse market movements especially in the
first half of 2020 triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Business
evolution also contributed slightly to a higher SCR, driven by the net
earned premiums in the Property-Casualty business segment. Other

effects such as model updates or the loss in diversification benefit fur-
ther contributed to the increment. This was partially compensated by
management actions such as risk mitigating measures, including, but
not limited to equity de-risking, increasing asset duration, and the pur-
chase of credit default swap protection to dampen the impacts of
COVID-19.

1.2019 risk profile figures adjusted based on the 2020 model changes impact.

The Group’s total pre-diversified market risk increased by € 2.0 bn,
which was mainly driven by credit spread risk, especially in the
Life/Health business segment, due to higher exposures and lower pol-
icyholder participation following the decline in interest rates. The lower
interest rates together with lower interest rate volatilities contributed
to lower interest rate risk, which was supported by management
actions — in particular duration management measures — that
improved the interest rate risk profile. The volatility in equity markets
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in equity de-risking
activities at most entities and investment in alternatives and infra-
structure. However, most equity indices fully recovered from the
COVID-19 shock in the first half of the year. This effect combined with
the lower policyholder participation increased the equity risk. Real

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group

estate risk remained broadly unchanged. The higher inflation risk was
mainly driven by exposure especially in the Property-Casualty business
segment. The overall increase in market risk was also supported by
business growth, while exposure changes due to asset/liability man-
agement measures and the corresponding effects on the diversifica-
tion between market risk factors reduced the impact to some extent.

INTEREST RATE RISK

As of 31 December 2020, our interest-rate-sensitive investments
excluding unit-linked business —- amounting to a market value of
€ 486.5 bn (2019: € 460.8 bn)! — would have gained € 58.6 bn (2019:
€ 49.8 bn) or lost € 49.8 bn (2019: € 42.8 bn)’ in value in the event of
interest rates shifting by -100 and +100 basis points, respectively. How-
ever, these impacts would have been partially offset by policyholder
participation. In addition, the Solvency || Own Funds effect is much
more limited due to our active duration management, limiting the du-
ration mismatch of the Group to negative 0.1 years, representing Sol-
vency II liabilities of longer duration than assets.

EQUITY RISK

As of 31 December 2020, our investments excluding unit-linked busi-
ness that are sensitive to changing equity markets - amounting to a
market value of €66.6 bn? (2019: €75.7 bn) - would have lost
€ 17.9 bn* (2019: € 20.0 bn) in value assuming equity markets had
declined by 30%. However, this impact would have been partially off-
set by policyholder participation.

REAL ESTATE RISK
As of 31 December 2020, about 5.4% (2019: 5.5%) of the total pre-
diversified risk was related to real estate exposures.

Throughout 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no mate-
rial events with regard to credit migration risk and default risk.

The overall credit risk for the Allianz Group increased by € 0.6 bn
to € 6.1 bn (2019: € 5.5 bn). This was mainly driven by the lower interest
rate environment compared to the previous year, which generally in-
creased credit risk exposures, thereby increasing credit risk. This also
contributed to a decrease in the loss-absorbing capacity of technical
provisions in the traditional life business, which increased the credit risk
after considering policyholder participation.

CREDIT RISK - INVESTMENTS

As of 31 December 2020, the credit risk arising from our investment
portfolio accounted for 81.5 % (2019: 80.6%) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk®.

Credit risk in the Life/Health business segment is primarily driven
by long-term assets covering long-term liabilities. Typical investments
are government bonds, senior corporate bonds, covered bonds, self-
originated mortgages and loans, and a modest amount of derivatives.
In the Property-Casualty business segment, fixed-income securities
tend to be short- to mid-term, due to the nature of the business, which
explains the lower credit risk in this segment.

The counterparty credit risk arising from derivatives is low, since
derivatives usage is governed by the group-wide internal guideline for
collateralization of derivatives, which stipulates master netting and
collateral agreements with each counterparty and requires high-qual-
ity and liquid collateral. In addition, Allianz closely monitors counter-
parties’ credit ratings and exposure movements.

business) reflecting the Solvency I framework, and therefore is not based on classifications given by accounting principles.

future exposure for derivatives and reinsurance, and other off-balance sheet exposures.

CREDIT RISK - CREDIT INSURANCE

As of 31 December 2020, 8.6% (2019: 11.0%) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk was allocated to Euler Hermes credit
insurance exposures.

CREDIT RISK — REINSURANCE
As of 31 December 2020, 1.2% (2019: 1.1%) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk was allocated to reinsurance exposures.
Of the Allianz Group's reinsurance recoverables, 75.5% (2019:
82.4%) were distributed among reinsurers that had been assigned an
investment-grade rating; the remaining 24.4% (2019: 17.5%) were non-
rated reinsurance recoverables. The movements in the reinsurance ex-
posure are mainly due to an expanded reinsurance program. For sub-
stantial single-name reinsurance exposures or exposures to non-rated
captives, risk-mitigating techniques such as collateral agreements or
funds-withheld concepts are in place. In particular, the economic rein-
surance exposure to General Electric was reduced in 2020 by increas-
ing the amount of trust assets and obtaining credit protection.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

The decrease in Property-Casualty underwriting risk was mainly
driven by premium non-catastrophe risk due to model and expo-
sure updates. This was partly offset by reserve risk which increased
in line with the underlying reserve level.

Overall, the underwriting risk profile for the Allianz Group is not
expected to change much, as we do not plan to significantly
change our underwriting standards (Allianz Standard for P&C Un-
derwriting) or our risk appetite with regards to natural catastrophe,
man-made, or terror risks and our corresponding retrocession rein-
surance strategy.

Nevertheless, the underwriting guidelines were refined to miti-
gate significant future accumulations from pandemics and an ad-
ditional retrocession cover for natural catastrophe frequency losses
was placed.

The loss ratios for the Property-Casualty business segment are
presented in the following table:

‘L Represents claims and insurance benefits incurred (net), divided by premiums earned (net).

The top three perils contributing to the natural catastrophe risk
as of 31 December 2020 were: windstorms in Europe, floods in
Germany, and earthquakes in Australia.

LIFE/HEALTH
The underwriting risk capital contribution of biometric risk in-
creased by € 0.35 bn compared to the previous year. This is mainly
due to the impact of lower interest rates and other adverse market
movements triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic on the longevity
risk for most major Life/Health portfolios. Contributions from the
Property-Casualty and the Corporate and Other business seg-
ments are generated by the longevity risk of the internal pension
schemes they contain.

Due to effective product design and the diversity of our prod-
ucts, there were no significant concentrations of underwriting risks
within our Life/Health business segment.

BUSINESS RISK

The risk capital contribution of business risk decreased by € 0.5 bn
compared to the previous year. This is driven by the impact of lower
interest rates and other adverse market movements triggered by
the COVID-19 pandemic on the lapse and lapse mass risk for most
major Life/Health insurance portfolios.

100

OPERATIONAL RISK

The decrease in risk capital for operational risks was driven by the
regular annual update of local parameters. The decrease is largely
due to reduced regulatory risks based on observed fines in the in-
dustry, e.g., for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but
also due to a reduction of the originally too conservatively set pru-
dency margin in the estimation of internal frauds. The increasing
risk due to the pandemic was compensated by the decrease of op-
erational risk in case of business continuity events based on the ob-
served effectiveness of business continuity measures during the
COVID-19 crisis. This finally led to a neutral risk capital impact of
COVID-19 on operational risk capital. Foreign currency exchange
effects played a minor role.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Detailed information regarding the Allianz Group's liquidity risk ex-
posure, liquidity, and funding — including changes in cash and cash
equivalents — is provided in Liquidity and Funding Resources and in
notes 13, 19 and 34 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As
can be inferred from the section on the management of liquidity
risks, while these are quantified and monitored through regular
stress test reporting as well as properly managed, they are not
quantified for risk capital purposes.

INTEGRATED RISK AND CONTROL SYSTEM FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING

The following information is provided pursuant to §289(4) and
§ 315 (4) of the German Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch —
HGB")

In line with both our prudent approach to risk governance and
compliance with regulatory requirements, we have created a frame-
work and processes to identify and mitigate the risk of material errors
in our Consolidated Financial Statements (this also includes our mar-
ket value balance sheet and risk capital calculation risks). The Inte-
grated Risk and Control System (IRCS) is regularly reviewed and
updated. It covers three buckets of risks: financial reporting risks, com-
pliance risks, and other operational risks (including IT risks). The IT con-
trols are based on COBIT 5 and include, for example, controls for
access right management, project and change management. In addi-
tion, our Entity Level Control Assessment (ELCA) framework contains
controls to monitor the effectiveness of our system of governance.

ACCOUNTING AND CONSOLIDATION PROCESSES

The accounting and consolidation processes we use to produce our
Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a central consolida-
tion and reporting IT solution and local general ledger solutions. The
latter are largely harmonized throughout the Group, using standard-
ized processes, master data, posting logics, and interfaces for data
delivery to the Holding. Access rights to accounting systems are man-
aged according to strict authorization procedures.

Accounting rules for the classification, valuation, and disclosure of
allitems in the balance sheet, the income statement, and notes related
to the annual and interim financial statements are defined primarily in
our Group accounting manual. Internal controls are embedded in the
accounting and consolidation processes to safeguard the accuracy,
completeness, and consistency of the information provided in our
financial statements.

INTERNAL RISK AND CONTROL SYSTEM APPROACH

Our approach can be summarized as follows:

— We use a centrally developed risk catalog which is linked to indi-
vidual accounts. This risk catalog is reviewed on a yearly basis and
is the starting point for the definition of the Group’s as well as the
operating entities’ scope of financial reporting risks. The method-
ology is described in our IRCS Guideline. In the course of the scop-
ing process, both materiality and susceptibility to a misstatement
are considered simultaneously. In addition to the quantitative cal-
culation, we also consider qualitative criteria, such as the expected
increase in business volume or the complexity of transactions.

- Based on the centrally provided risk catalog, our local entities
identify risks that could lead to material financial misstatements.

1 Solvency and Financial Condition Report and Regular Supervisory Report

‘Annual Report 2020 - Allianz Group

— Preventive and detective key controls addressing financial report-
ing risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and
impact of financial misstatements. When a potential risk material-
izes, actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial mis-
statement. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting
processes on information technology systems, we have also imple-
mented IT controls.

— Last but not least, we focus on ensuring that controls are appro-
priately designed and effectively executed to mitigate risks. We
have set consistent process and documentation requirements
across the Allianz Group for elements such as the design of key
controls and evidence of their execution as well as related con-
trol design and effectiveness testing procedures. We conduct an
annual assessment of our internal control system to maintain
and continuously enhance its effectiveness. Group Audit and lo-
cal internal audit functions ensure that the overall quality of our
control system is subject to regular control testing, in order to as-
sure reasonable design and operating effectiveness. Internal Au-
dit does so through a comprehensive risk-based approach that
assesses the key controls of the company’s internal procedures
and processes, including local and group-internal controls over
financial reporting risks, from an integrated perspective.

GOVERNANCE

The Group center functions, the Group Disclosure Committee, and our
operating entities support the Allianz SE Board of Management to
ensure the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Group Disclosure Committee ensures that the board mem-
bers are made aware of all material information that could affect our
disclosures, and assesses the completeness and accuracy of the infor-
mation provided in the quarterly statements, half-year and annual
financial reports as well as in the Solvency II qualitative reports!. In
2020, the Group Disclosure Committee met on a quarterly basis before
the quarterly statements and financial reports were issued. An addi-
tional meeting was held prior to issuance of the Solvency II qualitative
reports.

Subsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individually
responsible for adhering to the Group’s internal governance and con-
trol policy and for creating local Disclosure Committees that are similar
to the Group-level committee. The entities’ CEOs and CFOs provide
periodic sign-offs to the management of Allianz SE, certifying the
effectiveness of their local systems of internal control as well as the
completeness, accuracy, and reliability of financial data reported to
the Holding.
