FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

3.1

3.1.1 FISCAL 2016 YEAR HIGHLIGHTS

3.1.11 A solid performance

In Fiscal 2016 all activities contributed to the +2.5% organic
growth" in revenue except for the Remote Sites activity, which
was down by -16%, affected by a severe decline in the mining
and oil and gas industries. Excluding the Remote Sites activity,
the underlying growth was +4%, benefiting for about +0.5%
from the success of the Rugby World Cup event in the United
Kingdom in the first quarter and a solid performance from
Benefits and Rewards.

Geographically, there was an improvement in growth in North
America, strong growth in the United Kingdom and Ireland,
and Continental Europe was up +1.0% with some recovery
in Corporate in mature economies and sustained growth in
Germany and Russia, offset by a difficult situation in France,
especially in the fourth quarter.

Operating profit excluding the currency effect and before
exceptional expenses, was up +8.2% in line with the objective
set at the beginning of the year. The operating margin improved
by +30 basis points, excluding currency effect and exceptional
expenses, benefiting from productivity initiatives and the first
results of the Adaptation and Simplification program launched
at the beginning of the fiscal year. A total of 108 million euros
of exceptional expenses were incurred during the year on this
program. Net financial expense increased slightly due to 21
million euros of exceptional indemnities resulting from the early
reimbursement of some US private placement debt as part of
a debt restructuring program to extend maturities and reduce
financing rates. The tax charge was also up slightly at 33.7%
against an exceptionally low tax rate of 31.1% last year. As a
result, Group net profit declined by -9%. Net profit before these
non-recurring items and excluding currency fluctuations, was
up +5.2%.

Confident in the outlook for the Group, the Board has decided
to propose a dividend of 2.40 euro per share, up +9.1%. This
implies a 57% pay-out ratio while maintaining circa 50% pay-
out ratio on net profit before non-recurring items.

FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

Fiscal 2016 Free cash flow amounted to 595 million euro, after
unusually high capex linked to the start-up of the Rio Tinto
contract and Rugby World Cup timing impact. Net debt was
up slightly at 407 million euro, and the balance sheet remained
strong with gearing® at 11% and a net debt ratios of 0.3

In March, Sodexo joined the CAC 40 index, thus confirming the
regularity of its performance.

3.1.1.2 Segmentation enhancing business

opportunities

Clients seeking productivity and global footprint in Energy
and Resources:

In March, Sodexo was awarded a ten-year contract with
leading global mining company Rio Tinto, estimated at 2.5
billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.8 billion euro) over
10 years, to deliver integrated facilities management services
in the company’s extensive operations in Australia’s Pilbara
region. This is the largest contract of its kind for Sodexo. Rio
Tinto’s assets in this region comprise ports, towns, aerodromes,
operational sites, accommodation sites, commercial buildings
and residential properties. The Group was successfully awarded
the contract after demonstrating a number of strengths in key
areas such as consistency and quality in services, alignment
with improving quality in village life and strong engagement
with local communities. The Sodexo teams will provide
project management and integration, building and grounds
maintenance, accommodation and catering, village and town
services, cleaning, aerodrome management, transport and
property management. The different start-up phases are
progressing in line with expectations and the contract should
be fully ramped-up during the course of fiscal 2017. The capacity
of the global Energy and Resources segment team to mobilize
more than 100 experts around the Group was key to winning
this exceptionally large contract.

(1) Organic growth is defined as growth at constant consolidation scope and exchange rates (converting Fiscal 2016 figures at Fiscal 2015 rates, except for Benefits
& Rewards in Venezuelan Bolivar (Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2075 revenues and issue volume in VEF have been converted at the exchange rate of USD 1 = VEF

645 us. VEF 199 for Fiscal 2075).

(2) Exceptional expenses are the costs of implementation of the Adaptation and Simplification program in Fiscal 2016 (108 million euro)
(3) Non-recurring items: 108 million euro of exceptional expenses and 21 million euro of early debt reimbursement indemnity, both net of taxes (respectively 77

million euro and 13 million euro)

(4) Group borrowing on the balance sheet less operating cash.
(5) Gearing: Net Debt/Shareholders equity.

(6) Net Debt ratio: Net Debt/EBITDA

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

The crisis in the energy and resources sector has helped clients
to recognize the advantages of global agreements with their
service-providers. As a result, in September, the Group signed
contract extensions with Seadrill, leading offshore drilling
contractor, and Shell. The Seadrill contract spans 5 years, 90% of
the company’s global fleet and a total value of 200 million euro
The Shell contract represents 135 million euro over five regions
worldwide. These wins are driven by Sodexo’s commitment to
safety and performance, a world-class service culture, technical
expertise in the segment and a holistic approach to Quality of
Life.

Further contract extensions in Facilities Management for
existing Corporate clients:

Relationships with existing worldwide clients are also continuing
to develop. Integrated facilities management contracts have
been signed with Danone and Unilever in Indonesia, Huawei in
Romania, Colombia and Malaysia and Pfizer in 12 countries
in Asia. The global airport lounge offer for clients is attracting
names such as United Airlines. In all these examples the key has
been the interest for the client of a global standardized integrated
services offer, adapted to the local environment.

Driving segment development in white spaces:

The Group signed its first contract in the Australian justice
market for a five-year term, and two five-year extension
options, with the Western Australian Government to manage
and operate the new 254 bed women’s Melaleuca Remand and
Reintegration Facility. As part of the contract, which starts up
in December 2016, Sodexo will be developing partnerships with
non-government organizations to provide culturally appropriate
rehabilitation and reintegration services and programs to help
inmates successfully reintegrate the community and reduce
reoffending risk. The Group's long and successful track record of
managing and operating more than 120 facilities in the justice
sector internationally was key to winning this contract. The 20
year UK experience of managing custodial and through-the-gate
services for women offenders was an essential element of the bid

Transfer of expertise into new markets:

Sodexo has installed and is now operating, as part of its Clinical
Technology Solutions, a Lithotripter (medical ultrasound
equipment for kidney treatments) for the Makati Medical Center,
one of the top hospitals in the Philippines. This is a 5-year
contract in which Sodexo has recommended the equipment,
procured the device, trained the personnel and is now providing
the Lithotripsy and associated services. Without the segment
expertise and the sharing of experience, this contract would not
have been possible.

FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

3.11.3. The Group’s corporate responsibility
engagement is confirmed
and recognized both internally

and externally

Employee engagement up +9 points since 2014 to 68%.
The latest employee engagement survey was proposed for the
first time, to all employees around the world with more than six
months within the Group. With a response rate of 57% anda
nine-point increase in the engagement rate to 68%, the digital
survey was a success. The external benchmark of 60% and the
Group's internal objective of 65% have been exceeded. Other
learnings from the survey are that 80% of employees consider
Sodexo to be a socially and environmentally responsible company
and 88% prefer working for Sodexo than for a competitor.

In terms of the financial community, the Dow Jones
Sustainability index has confirmed Sodexo as industry leader
for the 12th consecutive year. Sodexo was one of only eight
companies worldwide that achieved all three top ranks in the
2016 Robeco SAM yearbook: Gold Class, Industry Leader and
Industry Mover. The Group is also confirmed as a component
of the STOXX® Global ESG Leaders index and the Ethibel
Sustainability Index (ESI) Excellence Europe.

At the United Nations Women’s Empowerment Principles
awards, Michel Landel, CEO, and Janet Awad, regional Chair of
Latin America were awarded the CEO Leadership Award which
recognizes a company for its demonstrated commitment to and
implementation of policies that advance and empower women
in the workplace, market place and community. In particular, the
United Nations acknowledged the Sodexo Women’s International
Forum for Talent (SWIFt), which underpins Sodexo’'s strategy for
improving the Group's gender balance.

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) awarded the maximum score to
Sodexo on its Palm Oil Buyers Scorecard this year, reflecting
the very active and long-term approach that Sodexo has taken
to progressively increasing use of responsible palm oil

Sodexo joined forces with Ardo, McCain, PepsiCo, SCA, Unilever
Food Solutions and the WWF to launch the International Food
Waste Coalition in 2015, in order to combat food waste
throughout the food services value chain

The Group also made a commitment to purchase exclusively
sustainable fish and seafood in the 80 countries where the
Group operates and to reduce CO; emissions by 34% by 2020,
especially in the supply chain and by contributing to its clients’
emissions reduction initiatives.

Sodexo and the WWF have worked together to design and deploy
best practices to lessen the environmental impact of the Group's
services at its client sites, including through a program to reduce
food waste and the adoption of technologies that will cut energy
use by 12% to 45%

3.1.2.2 Currency effect

FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

Sodexo operates in 80 countries. The percentage of total revenues and operating profit denominated in the main currencies are as

follows:
Operating
profit before
Revenues exceptional costs
U.S. dollar 41% 45%
Euro 26% 14%
UK pound sterling 10% 10%
Brazilian real 4% 15%

The currency effect is determined by applying the previous year’s average exchange rates to the current year figures except for
Benefits & Rewards in Venezuelan Bolivar. All Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 figures in VEF have been converted at the exchange rate

of USD 1= VEF 645 us. VEF 199 for Fiscal 2015

Impact of exchange rates (in %, average rate) _ (in %, closing rate) Revenues —_ exceptional costs Net profit
Euro/U.S. dollar +4,8% +0.7% 381 25 10
Euro/Brazilian real -18.9% +12.9% (211) (42) (25)
Euro/UK pound sterling -2.7% -14.2% (57) (4) (3)

During Fiscal 2016, the U.S. dollar stabilized, resulting in a
much less significant year on year impact than in the preceding
year. However, the Brazilian real declined significantly from July
2015, resulting in an average decline in Fiscal 2016 of -18.9%
Nevertheless, the Brazilian real picked up significantly from
March 2016, and the balance sheet closing rate for Fiscal 2016
actually increased by +12.9% relative to the closing rate for
Fiscal 2015. The trends were the opposite in the UK, with the
Pound Sterling falling considerably against the euro from June
2016, after the Brexit referendum

In terms of the Venezuelan Bolivar, the Group considers that
the best estimate of the exchange rate at which funds from its
activities in Venezuela could be repatriated is the DICOM rate.
The exchange rate used for the year ended August 31, 2016

H REVENUES BY ACTIVITY

is therefore 1 U.S. dollar = 645 bolivars (1 euro = 718 bolivars)
relative to the Fiscal 2015 rate of 1 U.S. dollar = 199 bolivars
The effect of this depreciation is not material at Group level, as
the Group's operations in Venezuela now represent just 0.1%
of consolidated revenues and less than 0.4% of consolidated
operating profit.

3.1.2.3 Revenues

Fiscal 2016 consolidated revenues totaled 20.2 billion euro,
increasing +2.2% year-on-year. Organic revenue growth was
+2.5%. The currency effect was negative at -0.4%, slightly
offset by a +0.1% contribution from acquisitions and disposals
of subsidiaries.

TOTAL

The breakdown in the +2.4% organic growth in On-site Services
can be analyzed in several different ways, by type of service or
by the combination of retention and development.

At +4.5%, facilities management services organic growth
was significantly better than the +1.5% increase recorded for
foodservices. Non-food services now represent 30% of On-site
Services sales.

In Fiscal 2016, client retention was stable at 93.1%. This stability
masks an improvement in North America and the UK resulting
from larger and larger contracts which are renewed less regularly

and a decline in retention in the Rest of the World, particularly in
Latin America. The development rate of new business at 7.2%
was down 30 basis points: significant new business in the Rest
of the World (including the Rio Tinto contract) was offset by slow
new business particularly in Universities in North America, and
in the United Kingdom and Ireland due to the focus on the Fiscal
2015 start-ups. Elsewhere, new business was relatively stable.
Comparable unit growth was +2.1%, similar to the +2.2% in
Fiscal 2015. The significant volume decline in Remote Sites was
compensated by more contract extensions in integrated facilities
management services to existing clients in all other segments.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Health Care and Seniors organic growth improved steadily
during Fiscal 2016. The +4.9% increase for Fiscal 2016 reflected
new contracts won in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 as well as
strong comparable unit sales growth

FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

In Education, organic revenue growth was +0.4%. The increase
reflected the combination of solid same site growth in demand

TOTAL 5,690 5,686 +1.0% -0.4% -0.5% +0.1%

In Continental Europe, revenues amounted to 5.7 billion
euro, stable on the previous year. Organic growth was +1.0%,
reflecting some recovery in Corporate activity in most other
mature countries in the region, and a strong growth in Germany,
Russia and in the developing economies. This performance was
partially compensated by a difficult situation in France, and more
particularly in the fourth quarter due to strikes, flooding and
terrorism

In the Corporate segment, organic growth of +1.7% was
attributable to modest growth in revenues at existing sites in
Southern Europe and the Nordic countries; and continued robust
growth in developing economies, in particular in Russia and
Turkey, supported by the continued success of the integrated
services offer. In France, the Justice activities were impacted
by the loss of a prison contract, and Sports and Leisure, in

UNITED KINGDOM AND IRELAND

particular the boats on the Seine, was significantly impacted
by the disappointing Summer tourist season in Paris resulting
from the flooding in June and the terrorist attacks in November
2015 and July 2016

The -1.3% contraction in Health Care and Seniors revenues
was mainly due to weak growth at existing sites and a selective
approach to new contracts, especially in France impacted by
severe cost cutting and a lack of new development opportunities
in the public hospitals segment. The Korian contract in Seniors,
won last year, is ramping up successfully. Good results were
achieved in the Nordic countries, with the start-up of a contract
to provide medical equipment to individuals for the province of
Ostergétland in Sweden

3 | CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

Revenues in the United Kingdom and Ireland increased +9.6%
to reach 2.0 billion euro. Organic growth of +11.3% was in
part due to the significant contribution of the Rugby World Cup
contract in the first quarter of the year. However, even without
the Rugby World Cup effect, the organic growth trend was a solid
+5.3% due to the ramp-up of the many new contracts won in
Fiscal 2015 and strong retention during the year. The result of
the Brexit referendum has not had an impact on activity although
it may have slowed down some public sector decision-making
in some of the bids

In the Corporate segment, organic revenue growth was +14.2%.
This very strong performance was largely attributable to the
services provided in connection with the Rugby World Cup in the
first quarter, which contributed 131 million euro to revenues,
or +8.3% of the organic growth. However, even without the
Rugby World Cup, organic growth was a solid +5.9% due to the
progressive start-up of major contracts signed in Fiscal 2015
(Transforming Rehabilitation, Diageo...) and contract extensions
with existing clients for a wider scope of facilities management
services. Business development has been more modest in Fiscal
2016 because of the heavy commitment of resources to previous
year start-ups.

Health Care and Seniors showed an organic decline of -0.9%.
The ramp-up of Imperial College Hospitals in London had a
significant contribution to growth over the last two years
There was no start-up this year in the absence of attractive
development opportunities. Same site sales have been solid but
not enough to compensate the losses during the year.

In Education, organic growth of +15.1% reflected solid new
business with, in particular, the start-up of York St John and
Northumbria universities and several new school contracts.

Brexit:

In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European
Union. Sodexo has been present in the United Kingdom since
1988 and has around 35,000 employees there today. The
Group's business should not be impacted materially by the
United Kingdom leaving the European Union. The Group is
a local player, working with local suppliers and employees,
and very often for Government authorities and Government
services. Of course, growth in activity will depend upon growth
in GDP and employment in the country

In the Rest of the World region (Latin America, Africa, Middle
East, Asia, Australia and Remote Sites), Fiscal 2016 revenues
amounted to 3.1 billion euro, down -10.3%. In terms of organic
change compared with the previous year, activity was down
-3.2%. The region was severely affected by the decline in Remote
Site revenues of -16%. Excluding Remote Sites, organic growth
from the region remained strong at +7.0%

Corporate revenues fell by -4.9% organically due to:

e In Remote Sites, severe reductions in oil and commodity prices
forced clients operating in these industries to revise down
their production levels which in turn led to a corresponding
reduction in required service levels. In Chile, several mining

Sodexo | Fiscal 2016 Registration Document

clients sought to diversify their suppliers in a strained
economic and social environment. As a result of these issues,
Remote Site revenues in the Rest of the World region were
down -16% organically. Activity stabilized in the third quarter
relative to the previous quarter and, from the fourth quarter,
the comparable base has become less challenging. The Rio
Tinto contract signed in March contributed to the activity in
July and August. The contract will have a more significant
impact in fiscal 2017, as will the Seadrill and Shell contract
extensions signed in September 2016

in the Middle East and Africa. In the last quarter, some
improvement in activity in Brazil compensated the slower
demand in the Middle East and Africa, where economies are
beginning to feel the impact of the sustained weakness in
the oil price.

In Health Care and Seniors, organic growth of +19.4% was
attributable to some contract wins and same site sales growth,
especially in Latin America and Asia

Education revenues were stable relative to Fiscal 2015. Solid
growth in Asia was offset by a contract exit in Africa

FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

Benefits and Rewards Services

Benefits and Rewards Services revenues were 780 million euro,
down -5.7% due to a sharp decline particularly in the Brazilian
real. Issue volume was up +6.9% organically, reflecting a
relatively resilient performance in all regions, with strong face
value growth in Brazil, solid growth in Europe and particularly
strong development in Mexico, Chile and Turkey. On the other
hand, organic revenue growth was more modest at +4.7%,
impacted by severe pricing competitiveness in Brazil, particularly
from the smaller players, and record low interest rates in Europe.

In Latin America organic growth was solid, with an increase of

Higher face values were an important growth driver in the region
In Brazil, the progressive rise in unemployment led to a decline
in the number of beneficiaries at existing clients. As a result, the
environment became more and more competitive throughout
the year as the smaller players, in particular, were aggressively
seeking new business. Face values rose by close to inflation
which more than compensated the decline in the number of
beneficiaries.

Growth in Mexico and Chile was particularly strong, with
face value increases, strong new business and an increase in

In Europe and Asia, issue volume organic growth was a strong
+6.2%. Organic growth in revenues was more modest at +3.1%.
Lowest-ever interest rates in mature Europe have helped to
create a gap between issue volume and revenue growth. However,
demand continued to be strong for existing and new products
in all markets, market penetration continued to develop in Asia
and momentum remained strong in Turkey

(1) Issue volume corresponds to the total face value of service vouchers, cards and digitally-delivered services issued by the Group (Benefits and Rewards Services

activity) for beneficiaries on behalf of clients.

(2) Organic growth is defined as growth at constant exchange rates and consolidation scope, except for Benefits & Rewards in Venezuelan Bolivar. Fiscal 2016 and
Fiscal 2075 revenues and issue volume in VEF have been converted at the exchange rate of USD 1 = VEF 645 us. VEF 199 for Fiscal 2015

The operating margin before exceptional expenses was 5.9%,
up +10 basis points relative to the previous year. Excluding the
currency effect of in particular, the weakness of the Brazilian real,

On-site Services margins continued to grow steadily led by
productivity gains, enhanced operating efficiency and the first
contribution from the Adaptation and Simplification program
The performance by region is as follows:

e In North America operating profit increased by +9.3%
excluding the currency effect and operating margin rose by
+30 basis points, reflecting a significant reduction in SG&A
costs and strong contract management.

e In Continental Europe the +18.4% growth in operating
profit and +70 basis points increase in operating margin,
excluding currency effect, were attributable to improved
On-site productivity and efficient management of food
purchasing costs as well as the ongoing effect of a more
selective approach to contract bidding.

e In the United Kingdom and Ireland, operating profit rose
by +50.4% excluding the currency effect, compared to a low

Sodexo | Fiscal 2016 Registration Document

comparative base in Fiscal 2015 impacted by significant
mobilization costs of new contracts. The margin increased
+170 basis points. This strong performance was due to a
focus on overheads and operational profitability as well as the
contribution of a successful Rugby World Cup event.

e The Operating profit declined in the Rest of the World
region by -38.6% excluding currency effects, reflecting the
difficult economic environment in the mining and oil and
gas industries and contract exit costs in Latin America. The
effective alignment of operating expenses in the Remote Sites
activity was not enough to offset the sharp decline in volumes.
In the second half, a small underlying improvement in margins
in the Remote Sites business, as volumes stabilized and cost
management caught up, was offset by the mobilization costs
of the new Rio Tinto contract as well as an investment in the
Asian technical platform

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

In Benefits and Rewards Services, operating profit and margin
were adversely affected by the -18.9% decline in the Brazilian
real relative to the euro. Excluding the negative currency effect,
the operating profit rose by +8.8% and margin by +110 basis
points. This strong performance was attributable to tight control
of overheads and continued optimization of processing costs.

3.1.2.5 | Group net profit

The Operating Profit after exceptional expenses of 108 million
euros was 1,095 million euros down -4.2%.

Net financing costs increased by 4 million euro. Net borrowing
costs fell substantially by 41 million euro due to a lower average
debt during the year and lower rates, with the average cost of
debt down from 3.8% in Fiscal 2015 to 3.2% in Fiscal 2016
However, other financial charges included a 21million euro
exceptional indemnity for the early redemption of 208 million
dollars of US private placement debt, at high interest rates,
as part of an ongoing debt restructuring program, to increase
maturities and lower interest rates. This will be more than offset
over future years by the reduction in future interest expenses

The effective tax rate increased to 33.7% from an exceptionally
low rate in Fiscal 2015 due in particular to the use of previously
unrecognized tax loss carry-forwards.

The share of profit of other companies consolidated by the
equity method was stable at 7 million euro. Profit attributed
to non-controlling interests were also stable at 24 million euro

FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

As a result, Group net profit was 637 million euro, down -9%.
Group net profit before non-recurring items (net of taxes)
amounted to 721 million euro, an increase of +3.0% at current
rates or +5.2% excluding the currency effect. Non-recurring
items were exceptional expenses of 108 million euro and debt
reimbursement indemnity of 21 million euro, respectively 71
and 13 million-euro net of tax

3.1.2.6 Earnings per share

Earnings per share before non-recurring items amounted to
4.77 euro, up +3.7%, and after non-recurring items to 4.21
euro, down -8.5%. The small accretion relative to change in net
profit (-9%) is due to the effect of the 300 million euro share buy-
back during the year, net of the lower number of treasury shares
carried resulting in a lower weighted average number of shares.

3.1.2.7. Proposed dividend

At the annual Shareholder’s Meeting to be held on January 24,
2017, the Board of Directors will recommend paying a dividend
of 2.40 euro per share for Fiscal 2016 and increase of +9.1%
over the prior year. This proposal reflects Sodexo’s policy of
maintaining regular growth in dividend in line with underlying
profits growth. The proposed dividend implies a 57% pay-out
ratio on reported figures and a stable pay-out ratio before non-
recurring items at =50%.

* Including changes in financial assets related to the Benefits and Rewards Services activity (48 million euro in Fiscal 2016 and 24 million euro in Fiscal 2015).

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 945 million
euro down -7.1%. The Adaptation and Simplification program
and some negative currency effects had an adverse impact on
operating cash flow. Working capital was affected by the Rugby
World Cup, for which much of the cash came in Fiscal 2015 and
most of the spend was in Fiscal 2016. Client payment delays
also increased somewhat, particularly in North America.

Net capital expenditure, including client investments amounted
to 398 million euro, representing 2% of revenues compared
to 1.8% last year. This increase is principally linked to the
investments of 64 million euro for the Rio Tinto contract start-up.

Operating free cash flow amounted to 595 million euro, down
from 688 million euro in Fiscal 2015. This variance is more than
explained by the net impacts of Rugby World Cup for 51 million
euro and Rio Tinto mobilization for 65 million euro.

Net acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries represented a
net spend of 42 million euro. After taking into account share
buy-backs of 300 million euro and dividend payments of
355 million euro, consolidated net debt only rose during the
year by 67 million euro to 407 million euro at August 31, 2016.

3.1.3.2. Acquisitions for the period

During Fiscal 2016, the Group strengthened its presence in the
Benefits and Rewards Services market in Portugal. In Personal
and Home Services, the Comfort Keepers subsidiary strengthened
its presence in the United States and Ireland. Total outlays for
acquisitions in the first half of Fiscal 2016, less the proceeds
from the sale of a few small businesses, amounted to 42 million
euro.

3.1.3.3. 2016 Share buy-back program

On November 19, 2015, Sodexo announced a 300 million euro
share buy-back program reflecting the strong balance sheet at
Fiscal 2015 year-end and the Board's confidence in the future
of the Group. The share purchases were completed in April 2016
and 3,390,886 shares, representing 2.2% of the capital, were
cancelled in June 2016

As of August 31, 2016, net debt was 407 million euro,
representing a gearing of 11%, compared to 9% as of
August 31, 2015. The Group’s financial position remains strong
with cash flow covering most of the investments, the dividend
and the 300 million euro share buy-back program. Also in Fiscal
2016, the Group reimbursed 526 million euro of its debt, of
which 184 million euro was early reimbursement, part of a
debt restructuring program aimed at extending maturities and
benefiting from extremely low interest rate opportunities. As a
result, at year end, both the cash and the gross debt levels had
fallen relative to the end of the previous year. The average cost
of debt fell from 3.8% for Fiscal 2015 to 3.2% in Fiscal 2016
and the pro forma rate after refinancing is estimated at 2.7%

At the end of Fiscal 2016, the Group had unused lines of credit
totaling 1,168 million euro.

The operating cash position totaled 2,146 million euro, of which
1,498 million euro for Benefits and Rewards Services (including
restricted cash for 507 million euro and financial assets for
292 million euro).

3.1.3.4 Subsequent events

e On September 29, 2016 Sodexo redeemed in advance a
further 108 million U.S. dollars of its March 2011 U.S. private
placement, following on from the 208 million U.S. dollars
early redemption in August 2016. On October 14, 2016 the
Group issued 600 million euro worth of bonds, redeemable
in April 2027. All these refinancing transactions are part of a
program to considerably reduce average cost of borrowings
and extend maturities.

e Since the beginning of fiscal 2017, two acquisitions have been
closed

e Inspirus in the United States, a specialist in employee
recognition with a long experience and cutting edge
technology solutions

e PSLin the United Kingdom, a leading procurement provider
to the Hospitality industry

3.1.3.5 2017 Share buy-back program

Confident in the future while maintaining the financial flexibility
needed to invest in future development, the Board has also
decided to implement a 300 million euro share repurchase and
cancellation program in Fiscal 2017 (approximately 1.9% of
the share capital as per August 31, 2016). This transaction is
expected to be accretive to earnings per share starting in 2017.

3.1.3.6 Outlook

At the Board of Directors’ meeting chaired by Sophie Bellon
on November 15, 2016, Chief Executive Officer Michel Landel
highlighted his confidence in the future development of the
Group

The geopolitical environment will continue to be difficult in Fiscal
2017. However, the commodities markets have been stabilizing
for several quarters, which should provide a base for the Group's
Energy and Resources segment, particularly given the strong new
business from Rio Tinto, Shell and Seadrill, starting-up in the
year. The North American market will continue to provide growth
opportunities, with the development of integrated services
contracts. In particular, US Education will benefit from schools
new business signed in Fiscal 2016. The recovery in the Brazilian
real since April 2016 should also help the Group's margin mix.

FISCAL 2016 ACTIVITY REPORT

In Europe, the Group will have an easier comparative base in
France but a more difficult one in the United Kingdom without the
Rugby World Cup contribution in Fiscal 2016. Elsewhere, the slow
recovery in the mature economies and the strong momentum in
developing countries should continue.

The new organization by global segment combined with the global
functions are helping the teams to extend client contracts and
relationships into new services or new geographies, to identify
white space opportunities around the world and to develop the
exchange of best practices and standardized processes.

The Adaptation and Simplification program is on track to deliver
significantly more savings in Fiscal 2017 than in the previous
year and to achieve its target of 200 million euro of savings
in Fiscal 2018. This will sustain margin growth while at the
same time liberate resources to continue to develop the Service
Operations global platforms, innovative consumer centric digital
solutions and the quality of life integrated services offer.

The M&A pipeline is larger than it has been for several years and
two acquisitions have already been closed since the beginning
of the year:

e Inspirus employee recognition expertise and platforms bring
to Benefits and Rewards Services a scalable new opportunity
which together with the Motivcom activities in the United
Kingdom, acquired two years ago, will allow Sodexo to deliver
global recognition solutions for global clients.

e PSL will reinforce Sodexo’s proposition to deliver market-
leading food cost management solutions to its clients including
real-time e-platforms to facilitate efficient procurement and
operational support to maximize food savings.

The solid financial structure of the Group provides the capacity

to accelerate the rhythm of acquisitions. In the meantime, the

Board of Directors has approved a further 300 million euro share

buy-back during the year.

The Management is focused on accelerating growth while
continuing to increase margins

Despite challenging revenues comparable in the first half,
the Group is confident in achieving the following Fiscal 2017
objectives:

e Organic revenue growth of around 3%;

e Operating profit growth (excluding exceptional expenses
related to the Adaptation and Simplification program and
currency effect) of 8% to 9%.

The Board of Directors and Executive Committee confirm the

medium-term objectives of:

e Average annual revenue growth, excluding currency effect,
of between 4% and 7%;

e Average annual growth in operating profit, excluding
currency effect, of between 8% and 10%.

of business acquisitions and divestments, as follows

e For businesses acquired during the current period, revenue
generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the
organic growth calculation;

e For businesses acquired during the prior fiscal year, revenue
generated during the current period up until the first
