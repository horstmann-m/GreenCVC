REPORTS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO THE COMBINED GENERAL MEETING OF 13 JUNE 2013
Sopra Group’s business and key events in 2012

H Sopra Group’s business and key events in 2012

This report includes the summary of the management report as well
as the Group’s financial statements.

1.1. Business in 2012 -
Background

Over the last few years Sopra Group has developed a specific
business model based on Consulting, Systems Integration,
Application Outsourcing and Software Development for specific
industries (banking, human resources and real estate sectors).

The Group has positioned itself, and adopted a successful business
model, based not only on technological development but also on
outsourcing and business combinations. This novel business model
makes it difficult to make a comparison with other companies
within the sector which have positioned themselves differently.
The sector saw low growth in 2012, after reporting slightly more
significant growth in 2011. Revenue of companies in the Software
and Services sector increased by about 0.8% in France (Source:
Syntec), compared to 3.6% in 2011

Sopra Group posted revenue of €1,216.7 million in 2012,
representing total growth of 15.8% and organic growth of 2.4%.
The Group’s growth over the year was buoyed by a fourth-quarter
spike in revenue. Orders on high value-added offerings such as
major build and application outsourcing projects rose sharply at
the end of the year, as did sales of Sopra Banking Software licences.
The strongest revenue growth was achieved in the following
verticals: Services, Transport and Utilities (+ 11%), Manufacturing
(+9%) and, to a lesser extent, the Public Sector (+4%).

At 31 December 2012, Sopra Group employed a workforce of
14,303 people, an increase of nearly 1,700 staff compared to
2011, including 690 net recruits and more than 1,000 integrated
employees resulting from acquisitions.

Financial year 2012 was marked by the acquisition of
Callatay & Wouters (C&W), a specialist vendor of banking software,
the UK subsidiary of Business & Decisions and Tieto’s UK banking
software business (see paragraph 5 of this management report).

1.2.2. FORMATION OF SOPRA BANKING SOFTWARE

Financial year 2012 saw the formation of Sopra Banking Software,
which houses all of the Group’s banking products and solutions
businesses.

This new company consists of the following

All these businesses were transferred to Sopra Banking Software in
the second half of 2012, with the exception of Callataly & Wouters,
which was acquired directly by Sopra Banking Software.

Tieto’s UK business, acquired on 1 March 2012, was also
transferred to Sopra Banking Software in the first half of 2013.
Sopra Banking Software constitutes a cohesive business unit with
projected 2013 revenue in excess of €220 million.

net profit to €55.6 million or 4.5% of revenue, compared with
€62.9 million or 6.0% of revenue in 2011.

and outlook for 2013
4.1. Key events in 2012

4.1.1. CHANGE IN THE GROUP’S GOVERNANCE

STRUCTURE

A key event marking 2012 was the operational transition in Sopra
Group’s governance structure. In August, Pierre Pasquier was
appointed as Chairman and Pascal Leroy was appointed as Chief
Executive Officer. This major change is based upon the on-going
coordination and long-term collaboration between the Chairman's
office and Executive Management.

Following this change, Pierre Pasquier is in charge of steering the
Group’s strategy, including mergers and acquisitions, corporate
communications and financial transactions. He is supported
in this role by Pascal Leroy, who participates in the design and
implementation of the strategy and spearheads the operational
aspects of all of the Group's activities. The Chairman's office
also supports Executive Management in a number of operational
initiatives, such as the creation of Sopra Banking Software.

4.1.2. SOLID PERFORMANCE

Sopra Group recorded sustained growth in 2012, posting organic
growth of 2.4% and improvement in our margin on operating
activities to 9%, despite a slowdown in activity in the first half of
the year.

All geographic regions contributed to this solid performance, as the
subsidiaries outside of France generated close to one-third of the
Group's revenue.

Strategy and objectives:

Strategy and objectives: recent trends and outlook for 2013

increase when compared with 2004. The subsidiaries outside

headcount since 2004.

4.1.3. CONTINUATION OF THE KEY
CLIENTS PROGRAMME

clients in 2012. Accordingly, 30 key clients represented 51% of
Sopra Group’s revenue and organic growth of +6.8% relative to
2011, higher than that posted by the Group.

4.1.4. EUROPEAN EXPANSION AND CONSOLIDATION
OF THE BANKING SOLUTIONS OFFERINGS

a. Acquisitions of three European entities

With over thirty years in the banking software publishing market
in France offering Evolan solutions, Sopra Group expanded our
positioning in the European market in 2011 with the acquisition

development in the financial sector with the acquisition of three

aimed at consolidating the solutions offerings designed for the
banking sector in Europe, a market with high growth potential.

b. Creation of Sopra Banking Software

Sopra Group restructured and combined the activities of Evolan,
Delta Informatique, Tieto UK and Callatay & Wouters to create a
subsidiary dedicated to software publishing and solution integration
for the banking sector: Sopra Banking Software.

publishing business in 2012.

4.2. 2013 strategic direction

4.2.1. POSITIONING OURSELVES AS A VITAL

BUSINESS PARTNER

Sopra Group is continuing our transformation and performance in
an effort to position ourselves as a vital business partner to major
companies and organisations. This strategic direction is in line with
the Sopra 2015 project, which aims for revenue of between €1.5
and €2 billion (35% to 40% of which will be outside France) and
an operating margin of 10%

In a constantly changing information technology market,
technological advances like the mobile Web, social networking
and cloud computing are fostering new practices. This creates
opportunities for development and innovation to support the
Group's competitive position, not to mention that of our clients.
The Group will continue to offer solutions to meet a growing
inclination to optimise the maintenance and operating costs of
existing systems.

With a constant focus on consistency, independence and economic
performance, Sopra Group will intensify our efforts to make our
business model even more valuable, with a global offering that
includes consulting, technology services and software publishing.

To do this, four areas for strategic development have been defined:

= develop the added value provided to clients, by increasing our
proximity to them to better serve their business challenges and
improve the Group's capacity to support them throughout their
transformation cycle;

= maintain a constant effort to innovate, which will enable
us to offer them the best uses of technologies, particularly
digital technologies, in order to contribute to their growth and
competitiveness;

m improve the positioning of the Group's software publishing
business, particularly by industrialising production while ensuring
exemplary quality and through the performance of services
delivered;

= boost growth in Europe around our enhanced Group culture.

Registration Document 2012 - Sopra Group

4.2.2. CONSOLIDATING OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION
IN FINANCIAL SERVICES

The financial services sector represented approximately one-third of
our revenue in 2012. A true growth driver, this sector is of major
strategic interest for Sopra Group as we strive to maintain our
position as a leader in this segment by:

= offering comprehensive consulting, services and publishing
solutions;

= continuing to develop our Sopra Banking Software subsidiary;
= capitalising on our traditional positioning as an integrator;
= boosting our distribution capabilities internationally.

4.2.3. DEVELOPING THE PARTNERSHIP WITH AXWAY
SOFTWARE

Sopra Group aims to be the main integrator of Axway Software in
France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy.

The Group's offering will include solutions built around Axway
Software products as a first choice.

4.3. Recent developments

4.3.1. ACQUISITION OF HR ACCESS

Sopra Group's acquisition of HR Access is in line with Project 2015,
which aims not only to consolidate our positioning in the Human
Resources (HR) management market, but to attain the ambitious
objective of earning 30% of our revenue in software publishing as
well. The transaction guarantees that HR Access can continue its
activities and the possibility of contributing to Sopra Group's global
strategy. The Group will be able to offer a complete HR solution,
perfectly suited to the human resources market and companies of

Subsidiaries and associated entities

5.1.2. DECONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

No Sopra Group entities were deconsolidated over the course of
financial year 2012

5.1.3. REORGANISATION OF LEGAL ENTITIES

a. Partial transfers of assets

The General Meeting of 19 June 2012 approved the proposed
partial transfers by Sopra Group of assets relating to its banking
software development and distribution business to the Group's
wholly owned subsidiary, Sopra Banking Software, which already
houses the Callatay & Wouters business.

Following the recent acquisitions of Delta Informatique and Callatay
& Wouters, Sopra Group has decided to set up a new division
bringing together all of its banking software development and
distribution activities so as to harness synergies, concentrating all
of these operations within a single entity, Sopra Banking Software,
able to offer solutions to clients across the entire financial services
and banking sector.

From a legal standpoint, the partial merger was finalised on

30 June 2012 during Sopra Banking Software's General Meeting,

which decided on these transactions. Sopra Group transferred to

Sopra Banking Software all of the assets and liabilities of its banking

software development and distribution business:

= the Evolan business unit;

= all shares constituting the issued capital of the Belgian company
Business Architects International (BAI);

= all shares constituting the issued capital of the French company
Delta Informatique.

As consideration for these transfers, Sopra Group shall receive the

entirety of the Sopra Banking Software shares issued in exchange.

This operation had no impact on the consolidated financial
statements.

b. Mergers

In December 2012, Delta Informatique was merged into Sopra
Banking Software, effective retroactively for accounting and tax
purposes as at 1 January 2012. This merger had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

c. Company name change

Sopra Group’s Spanish subsidiary, formerly named Valoris Iberia,
changed its corporate name to Sopra Group Catalunya SA on
19 January 2012. It is now a subsidiary of Sopra Group Informatica SA.
The Callatay & Wouters companies changed their corporate names

to versions of the name Sopra Banking Software for each country
in which they operate.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Message from the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer

Message from the Chairman and the Chief
Executive Officer

Our vision of the world of information technology and related services is about empowering companies and organisations to achieve
sustainable progress.

We firmly believe that the technology innovations and organisational changes we all confront today represent significant opportunities.
Beyond dominant trends and developments, our role is to guide our clients so that they can make the best and most informed choices
possible and to assist them with their major transformation projects, at all times upholding the ethical principles and values embedded in
our policies and practices.

For nearly forty-five years, we have been building our Group's reputation around solid and lasting fundamentals and a set of core values
that we see as the Sopra Group DNA.

These values are:

= client-focused services;

= commitment to quality and professional excellence;
= respect for others;

= taking positive and effective action at all times;

= Group spirit.

56

SUPPORT

As an expression of these values, our Group is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, which serves as the founding framework
for our approach to sustainable development. Through this commitment, Sopra Group promotes the Global Compact's ten principles in the
areas of human rights, labour standards, protection of the environment and anti-corruption, which are fully in line with the fundamental
precepts upon which our Group was founded. Sopra Group is committed to encouraging compliance with these principles within its sphere
of influence, helping its clients and partners to adopt responsible business practices.

Our commitment to the Global Compact and the publication of our Corporate Social Responsibility Report are part of our ongoing efforts
to ensure transparency, fairness and loyalty in our dealings with all our stakeholders: clients, employees, shareholders, partners, suppliers
and members of civil society.

Since its founding, Sopra Group has been guided by a spirit of excellence, innovation and progress. It is in this same spirit that we have
implemented our current Enterprise Project and that we will continue to build relationships with all of our stakeholders.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

Sopra Group, a model corporate citizen

H | Sopra Group, a model corporate citizen

1.1. Activities and operations

Sopra Group is a leading European provider of information
technology and business consulting services and is also one of
Europe’s largest software companies. Sopra Group is a vital
business partner of large companies and organisations that seek
the best uses of digital technologies in order to contribute to their
growth and competitiveness.

This subject is discussed in Chapter 1, section 3 of the 2012
Registration Document.

1.2. Governance

Under the impetus of Pierre Pasquier, Chairman of Sopra Group, and
in order to firmly support the Group’s business strategy, the Board
of Directors’ tenures were renewed, and Sopra GMT (the founders’
holding company), Société Générale and the Group’s managers
entered into an addendum to the shareholders’ agreement.

At the same time, in line with the Group's independence project,
the Company changed its corporate governance structure in
2012. As a result of this change, the roles of Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer are now separated

This subject is discussed in Chapter 7, section 1 of the 2012
Registration Document.

1.3. Commitments

Our commitment to sustainability and our approach to corporate
social responsibility constitute a natural extension of Sopra Group's
values. The concern for rigorous management and respect for
these values guide the Group as we conduct our activities
consistently with the three pillars of sustainable development:
labour, environmental and societal concerns.

The key principles that guide Sopra Group's action on a day-to-
day basis are based on compliance with the laws and regulations
in effect in the countries where the Group operates our activities
and adherence to our commitments to optimally operate our
businesses.

Accordingly, Sopra Group’s commitments with regard to sustainable

development are based on principles that contribute to the Group's

economic development by being:

= transparent and fair with our clients, partners and suppliers in
our relationships and operating methods;

= respectful of the people that we employ through dignified, non-
discriminatory working conditions that provide opportunities for
progress for everyone;

= mindful of respect for the environment, in compliance with the
national and international standards in effect.

(1) For the sake of simplicity, the term “CSR Report” is used regularly in this Registration Document.

Supported by the Group's management and by all of the employees
associated with it, Sopra Group’s approach to sustainable
development is a continuous improvement process communicated
each year to our stakeholders through the annual Corporate and
Social Responsibility Report ‘) (CSR Report). This approach aims to
reconcile economic efficiency, equal employment opportunities and
respect for the environment.

1.3.1. LABOUR

Sopra Group is a key employer based on the amount of recruiting
carried out each year. The Company pays particular attention to the
employability and development of our employees, as demonstrated
by the number of training days offered and the percentage of total
payroll allocated to employee development. Executive Management
has the conviction that the Company's men and women should
be managed with a view to the long term and reaffirms that the
Human Resources dimension is one of the Group’s essential assets.

As a responsible employer, Sopra Group makes a priority of
recruiting young workers and giving them the opportunity for their
first job and the possibility of developing their skills. For several
years, the Company has implemented a successful strategy of hiring
trainees and in 2013 seeks to create an even more aggressive policy
with respect to offering work-training opportunities.

Sopra Group is committed with regard to all current employee-
related issues and has established a permanent structure to put
into practice the signed agreements and action plans beyond the
legal framework (seniors, gender equality, disabled workers, etc.).

Sopra Group also aims to be a major local player. The Group
has been able to create ties with the main economic players of
the labour pools where we operate and is committed on a day-
to-day basis in long-standing partnerships (schools, universities,
unemployment centres, etc.).

1.3.2. ENVIRONMENTAL

The analysis of the environmental impacts of the Group's activities
has helped to define opportunities for progress in the areas most
affected. Progress plans were therefore carried out in 2012 in
order to limit the use of the most polluting forms of transportation
for business travel, streamline information technology resources,
improve the energy efficiency of the premises Sopra Group
manages, implement paperless processes, and develop selective
sorting of waste. These plans will be continued in 2013.

Sopra Group is committed to a progress plan that involves the
Group's divisions and all of the employees who take part in this
initiative in their day-to-day operations.

An organisation is in place in France to boost the Group’s progress
in the environmental area. It is based on a network of participants
who are responsible for implementing the progress plans.

Sopra Group, a model corporate citizen

Starting in 2013, the entities outside of France will gradually be
integrated into the progress plans by taking into account the
actions and plans already initiated in the companies concerned and
by focusing on the regulations in effect in each country.

1.3.3. SOCIETAL

Our other commitments with respect to society are mainly focused
around the following areas: fairness and transparency with regard
to our stakeholders, meeting our clients’ expectations, our action
in favour of regional development through a sustained recruitment
policy, relationships based on proximity with local universities,
engineering schools and business schools, high expectations with
respect to business ethics, a responsible purchasing programme,
and a corporate patronage policy focusing on solidarity, education
and the environment.

1.4. Key events

1.4.1. 2012, A YEAR OF TRANSITION IN CONTINUITY

Anew Enterprise Project was created in 2012, called “Sopra 2015,”
built on the Group’s industrial fundamentals and on our values
in order to respond to developments in the market. This project
is consistent with the Group’s resolve to maintain strong and
sustainable independence.

Based on our three main business lines — consulting, technology

services and software publishing — the “Sopra 2015” project

comprises four major dimensions:

= expanding the Group’s presence in Europe in a consistent
manner around a strong Sopra Group culture;

= consolidating the positioning of the software publishing business
and, in particular, making Sopra Banking Software a European
leader in software publishing for the banking industry;

= developing leadership and added value in the management and
transformation of the Information Systems areas;

= addressing the growth and competitiveness challenges of the
Group's clients.

1.4.2. CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN 2012
WITH POTENTIAL FOR THE GROUP’S GROWTH

Sopra Group quickly deployed our strategy, completing a number

of acquisitions that strengthened our positioning in Europe and in

software publishing:

= March 2012: Business & Decision (UK subsidiary): consulting and
integration;

= March 2012: Tieto UK (UK subsidiary): banking software;

= April 2012: Callatay & Wouters (Belgian company): banking
software;

= June 2012: Adeuza (French company): consulting and publishing
for the mobility market.

The Group also successfully created Sopra Banking Software in
mid-2012, a Group subsidiary specialising in software publishing
dedicated to the financial market and grouping together:

= Evolan, Sopra Group's traditional banking solutions;

= Delta-Bank and Thaler, the solutions from Delta Informatique and
from Callatay & Wouters, companies acquired by Sopra Group in
2011 and 2012, respectively.

These solutions were combined within the range of Sopra Banking
Suite solutions and were essentially deployed in 2012 in France,
the United Kingdom and Belgium. The Group’s ambition for this
business is to make it a European leader.

1.4.3. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CSR
HIGHLIGHTS “

= February 2012: renewal of Sopra Group's commitment
with respect to the United Nations Global Compact.

= April 2012: publication of Sopra Group's Corporate and
Social Responsibility Report.

This is the first report based on the themes from Article 225 of
the Grenelle Environment 2 Act.

= June 2012: launch of the partnership with Green Cross
France & Territoires (GCFT).

Sopra Group is committed to protecting the environment by
providing financial support and expertise to GCFT, the French
association of Green Cross International, an NGO created by
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1993. Green Cross International's objective
is to support programmes associated with protecting the
environment.

September 2012: creation of a Social Responsibility unit
in the Human Resources department.

This unit, which works in close collaboration with the Group’s

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

The 2012 Gaia Index panel is made up of 230 listed companies
operating in three representative sectors of the French economy:
manufacturing, services and distribution. This panel of 230
companies represents €141 billion in revenue and close to one
million employees. The questionnaire and rating system are headed
up by an independent committee comprised of investors, listed
companies and analysts. The rating methodology of the Gaia
Index ranks these 230 companies and creates an additional index
comprised of the 70 companies that score the highest.

Organisation of Sustainable Development

Sopra Group's Sustainable Development programme and initiatives
are spearheaded at the highest level of the Company. They are
under the responsibility of a member of Executive Management,
who oversees the Group’s strategy in this area.

Group Sustainable Development department

Adedicated department, the Sustainable Development department,
was created at the end of 2010 to roll out the Sopra Group
sustainable development policy and to coordinate the progress
plan with the departments concerned.

The role of Sopra Group’s Sustainable Development department is
to lead and coordinate all of the Group's actions in the three areas
concerned: labour, environmental and societal.

The Sustainable Development department spearheads matters
across all areas of the Company, and in particular regulatory
reporting, including the annual Corporate Social Responsibility
Report, the assessment of greenhouse gas emissions completed
every three years, corporate patronage and solidarity partnerships,
the Corporate Social Responsibility assessment of suppliers and
service providers, and actions to raise employee awareness about
sustainable development.

Until 2012, its role and its activities were focused in France in
order to firmly structure and anchor Sopra Group in its approach
to sustainable development over the long term. This approach will
be rolled out gradually to all of the international entities starting
in 2013. The Group’s approach will have to integrate the actions
and programmes already launched by the international subsidiaries
and take into account the specific aspects associated with the
regulations in the countries concerned and with the operating
methods and management requirements of the international
entities.

Sustainable Development Committee

In early 2011, a specific body, the Sustainable Development
Committee, was created in France to define areas for improvement
with the managers concerned and to track the development of
the action plans associated with these areas. This Committee
brings together the managers of the key departments involved
in the Group’s approach (Sustainable Development, Human
Resources, Purchasing, Logistics, IT Resources and Security, Legal,
Quality, Corporate Communications, Financial Communications,

Sopra Group, a model corporate citizen

etc.) to work in full coordination to implement their respective
programmes. The Committee meets at least every two months and
interim meetings are scheduled depending on the requirements of
the action programmes.

Social Responsibility unit, Human Resources department

The labour component of Sustainable Development is a major
subject in the consulting and information technology services
businesses. As such, in order to deal with the key issues of the
labour component, a manager from the Group Human Resources
department was appointed in 2012 to head up and coordinate
the following issues: disabled workers, gender equality, seniors,
diversity, work-training opportunities, etc.

Environment unit

Oversight of environmental issues is shared among the Purchasing
department (responsible purchasing), the Logistics department
(management of business premises), the IT Resources and Security
department (management of IT purchases and energy efficiency of
IT equipment) and the Human Resources department (in particular,
carpooling).

1.5. CSR Reporting

1.5.1. SOPRA GROUP’S ORGANISATION
(ORGANISATIONAL CHART OF THE GROUP’S

COMPANIES)

This subject is discussed in Chapter 6, section 1 of the Registration
Document.

1.5.2. THE APPROACH

In 2011, Sopra Group initiated the preparation of its first CSR
reporting protocol for the collection of the required information,
in order to begin to integrate the regulations with respect to CSR
reporting. This protocol was deployed in France and helped to
produce the 2011 CSR Report.

In the second half of 2012, this protocol was revised as a result of
a preliminary verification of the CSR reporting by the firm Mazars,
one of the Group’s Statutory Auditors. The preparation of the 2012
report is based on Sopra Group’s CSR reporting protocol

This CSR report includes a significant amount of information
pertaining to Article 225 of the Grenelle Environment 2 Act, in
keeping with the general principles of the guidelines of the GRI
(Global Reporting Initiative) and complying as closely as possible
with the components of ISO 26000. In this regard, a cross-
referencing table is provided as an appendix to the report.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

1.5.4. SCOPE OF REPORTING

For the 2012 reporting, Sopra Group covered the companies in
France, excluding the new acquisitions in 2012 (Adeuza, Callatay
& Wouters France) for certain indicators. Our exclusion of these
companies is specified for each item of quantitative data.

Our reporting is partial for the companies located outside of
France. This is due to the need to stabilise the Sustainable
Development-Corporate Social Responsibility approach for the
companies in France (which represent two-thirds of the businesses)
and our gradual implementation of the CSR regulatory reporting
reference framework. Furthermore, several companies (Tieto UK,
Callatay & Wouters, Business & Decision UK) were acquired during
2012 and had an impact on the organisation of a portion of the
Group’s companies abroad.

For the Societal component, the reporting covered the companies
in France, except for the solidarity actions of the Group's subsidiary
in India. This subsidiary’s solidarity actions have already been very
structured for the last two years and were covered in the 2011
report.

When data relate to the international companies, the information
is mentioned in the report.

The consolidated CSR reporting for the Group as a whole will
gradually be more extensive starting in 2013.

1.5.5. REPORTING
The three successive stages in the reporting process are as follows:
a identifying the data and preparing to collect them;

= collecting and consolidating the data, controlling for consistency
in order to produce the indicators;

= using the indicators for publication in Sopra Group’s CSR Report.

The CSR reporting tools include the following

= the reporting protocol, which contains all of the information
for collecting the indicators by all of the people contributing to
the reporting. It is primarily intended for internal communication
within Sopra Group, in particular to prepare the annual reporting;

= indicator sheets, which specifically describe the characteristics
of the indicators communicated as part of the CSR report.

Sopra Group is a company that offers over 14,000 employees a
dynamic work environment and stimulating career prospects. We
are able to provide this vibrant work environment because the
Group’s activities are based on a broad diversity of professions,
regional and international locations and a strong corporate culture.
In addition to our major actions with respect to recruitment, since

Our responsibility to our

Our responsibility to our employees

These sheets are also presented as an appendix to the reporting
protocol;

= collection sheets, which are provided for the contributors to
supply the qualitative information and quantitative data;

a the CSR database, which is consolidated by the Sustainable
Development department from the collection sheets provided by
the various contributors.

The combination of the reporting protocol, Indicator sheets, and
the quantitative and qualitative data collection sheets provides the
information necessary to give a clear understanding of the tasks
and constitutes the guide for the contributor.

Other information on the reporting protocol is available on request
from the Sopra Group Sustainable Development department.

Each year in early December, the Sustainable Development
department schedules a meeting to prepare the plan for the CSR
Report with the managers of the various functions concerned and
the contributors. This meeting takes place during a Sustainable
Development Committee meeting

Specific calculations for certain indicators

In order to provide a clear understanding of the information
communicated, the Sopra Group Sustainable Development
department endeavoured to specify, whenever necessary, the
definitions or calculation methods for certain reported indicators.

Furthermore, certain prior data have been adjusted. This relates to
data for which errors have been detected after the fact, or data
that no longer relate to the scope or to the definition initially
established. We have identified these adjustments for the reader.

Exclusions

Sopra Group publishes qualitative and quantitative data in its
report on all of the labour-related, environmental and societal
subjects required by the governmental decree implementing
Article 225 of the Grenelle Environment 2 Act. However, a few
indicators are not addressed in this report when they are deemed
not relevant to Sopra Group’s business. This information that is
not addressed relates in particular to subjects relating to consumer
safety and those related to land use. These exclusions are specified
in the cross-referencing table appended to the report.

the Company was created Sopra Group has always put an emphasis
on retaining our employees, even during periods of profound

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

Our responsibility to our employees

This Enterprise Project, updated every five years, provides the
Group’s strategic vision and is based on a system of shared values.
These values are communicated on a day-to-day basis across
all levels of Sopra Group’s organisation, guiding the Group’s
managers and contributing to our operational performance.

2.1. Sopra Group’s Corporate
Culture

2.1.1. SHARING OF FUNDAMENTAL PRECEPTS

The Group’s system of values and fundamental precepts are shared
by our entire workforce. A comprehensive training programme
organised by Sopra Academy, the Group’s internal training
structure, and day-to-day support to the Company’s managers help
the Group’s employees grasp and adopt the Sopra Group culture
and fundamental precepts. This knowledge is shared in particular
during Integration, Management, Sales, Methods and Behaviour
seminars.

2.1.2. INTEGRATION OF NEW EMPLOYEES

The successful integration of new employees is essential to a Group
in which the workforce is constantly growing.

Training programmes, comprised of training milestones,
conversations with management, and discussions among peers,
help to integrate each new employee into the Group.

A three-day training and integration seminar is held for all new
employees. The purpose of the seminar is to share the history,
plans, values and offerings of the Group as well as our fundamental
precepts with regard to Sopra Group's focus on service and quality.
Sopra Group is mindful of integrating our new employees and
does so by bringing them together in special sessions after they
have worked for the Company for eighteen to twenty-four months.
For companies that are acquired, a dedicated integration plan
supplements the training programme.

2.2. Employment policy

Sopra Group’s growth is based on a policy of proactive talent
recruitment and skills development for our employees.

2.2.1. WORKFORCE AND TRENDS

In 2012, 2,617 new employees V joined the Group's workforce,
including 941 new employees outside of France. At the same

2.2.2. JOINERS AND LEAVERS

The Group's recruitment policy places a priority, in a deliberate
manner, on the hiring of young people having completed at

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

least five years of higher education, whether they are graduates
of engineering schools, business schools or universities. The vast
majority of newly recruited staff are offered permanent employment
contracts. The recruitment of experienced professionals is subject to
prior analysis to ensure that the requirements in question may not
be covered using internal human resources, with skills and expertise
developed through practical workshops and training courses.

To implement the recruitment policy defined by Executive
Management, the following annual plans are established

athe recruitment plan defines staffing requirements by
subsidiary, by level of experience and by operating entity. As
part of the annual budget process, each entity evaluates its
recruitment needs, in accordance with its objectives as assigned
by the Group. In preparing the year’s recruitment plan, medium-
term staffing requirements are categorised by business line.
Each entity’s recruitment plan is coordinated with its training
programme and its planned practical workshops;

= the communications plan includes all actions carried out to
ensure CV sourcing capacities. This plan enables the selection of
the best applicants, proposing targeted applications to entities
corresponding to their needs. It also seeks to raise the profile
and increase the attractiveness of Sopra Group’s employer brand;

= the educational partnership plan, intended to promote the
recruitment of graduates from preferred institutions and the
selection of promising interns (mostly those able to pre-qualified
for permanent positions with the Group) as well as work-study
personnel. For many years, Sopra Group has been nurturing
partnerships with engineering schools, business schools and
universities whose degree programmes correspond to the
requirements of its business lines. This plan serves as a guide for
all operational units to mobilise local operational staff;

a the internship and work-study plan, which sets quotas
for the number of interns and work-study personnel to be
recruited, organises the listing of offers and their dissemination
to educational institutions. This plan is directly tied to each
operating entity's budget preparation process. It targets those
schools, universities and training programmes where Sopra Group
is interested in recruiting interns and work-study personnel.

In order to serve the ambitions of growing and upscaling our
businesses, in 2013 Sopra Group will develop our name recognition
initiatives and increase our attractiveness with respect to employer
branding as well as our presence in professional social networks.

In addition, through our recruitment policy, Sopra Group contributes
to regional development with one-third of employees recruited for
our locations in the French provinces. This subject is discussed in
the social component of this report.

Employee turnover trends

In France, employee turnover totalled 9.2% v of headcount for all
employees under permanent employment contracts compared with
12% in 2011.

For the Group as a whole, France and International, this turnover
rate declined for productive employees from 12.5% in 2011 to
9.7% in 2012.

2.2.3. TRAINING POLICY

Sopra Academy, Sopra Group’s internal training
organisation

One of Sopra Group’s major objectives in the area of human
resources management is to continually enhance the expertise of its
employees and anticipate their professional development.

All Sopra employees must share and know the Group’s value

system and fundamentals in order to promote a common culture

and Group cohesion.

To meet its major challenges, the Group relies on its internal

training organisation, Sopra Academy, and on its Knowledge

Management system.

These mechanisms support Sopra Group’s advancement through

skills development and knowledge-sharing plans. The objectives of

this approach are to:

= serve the strategic vision for the development of the Group's
business segments outlined in the Enterprise Project;

= disseminate fundamentals and encourage employees to capitalise
on best practices through the Knowledge Management system;

a facilitate the integration of new hires and acquired companies;

= foster the Group's internationalisation;

= meet employee expectations in terms of personal development;

= enhance the talents of Sopra’s employees;

= implement regulatory provisions for professional training.

Through its training programmes and knowledge sharing system,

Sopra Academy contributes to guaranteeing the level of excellence
and adaptability of the Group’s employees.

Training offerings and Knowledge Management

Through a broad network of over 460 trainers and speakers,
Sopra Academy disseminates a comprehensive offering of
training sessions: orientation and integration seminars, training in
management, the Group’s business areas and offerings, personal
development, training in methods and tools, technologies and
solutions, among others.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

Our responsibility to our employees

In addition, Knowledge Management supports and supplements
these training programmes. It covers the areas of the training plan,
facilitates sharing of the Group’s fundamentals and capitalising on
best practices through its communities organised by business lines,
offerings and expertise. With all of the divisions and Community
Managers, Sopra Academy coordinates the Group Knowledge
Portal, a platform for knowledge sharing, available to all Group
employees.

Training programme and talent development

In an effort to support the development of employee talent,
Sopra Academy offers training programmes by business line. In
2012, Sopra Academy consequently offered new programmes to
managers and salespeople to help them acquire critical knowledge
when they take on their duties. In addition, programmes are
offered to consultants to help them grasp and adopt the Group’s
internal methods and tools.

New training modules have been created to meet the challenges
of upscaling with respect to technological innovation and new
practices.

Development of managerial skills

The ability of Sopra’s managers to globally manage the business,
motivate and develop their teams and promote a strong
entrepreneurial spirit at every level is critical to Sopra Group's
success.

Regardless of their business area, manager training aims to develop
all of the necessary managerial skills (sales, production, human
resources management and finance).

Within its programmes, in 2012 Sopra Academy conducted a
residential seminar for all of the Group’s managers covering the
cultural fundamentals of Sopra Group with respect to management.

2.2.4. TALENT DEVELOPMENT

Anticipating Group needs and adapting human resources are
critical to the success of the Sopra Group Enterprise Project while
maintaining employee motivation at a high level.

Registration Document 2012 - Sopra Group

Sopra Group’s dynamic Enterprise Project and the diversity of
its business segments provides a motivating work environment
conducive to the development of a variety of professional careers.

All new staff members joining the Group do so with the intention
of developing their skills and advancing in their chosen career.

Core Competency Reference Guide

The Core Competency Reference Guide describes all of the Group’s
business lines (Consulting, Technology Services, Software Publishing,
Application Outsourcing, Management, Project Management,
Sales, support functions). The Guide helps employees grasp the
demands of their positions as well as the possible career paths
within the different business areas.

The Core Competency Reference Guide is an essential tool that
helps managers guide the professional development of their
employees based on their aptitudes, their motivations and the
Group’s priorities. It also provides necessary material to attract new
talent in line with Sopra Group's business strategy and to make it
easier to integrate employees from acquired companies.

The Core Competency Reference Guide is a major tool used for
employee skills assessment and development.

In order to consistently add value in support of the development
of the Group’s services, the Core Competency Reference Guide is
updated on a regular basis to take into account changes in areas
regardless of the business line.

A system of continuous assessment to support employee
development

Employee assessment is the keystone of the human resources
development programme.

Sopra Group uses an assessment and career tracking system that
enables the Group to know its staff and regularly monitor their
development. This system is based on assignment reviews and
annual appraisals.

Employees actively participate in these assessments, which are
shared in the Human Resources committee meetings led jointly
by management and the Human Resources division and the
Transformation and Performance division.

In response to the Group’s growth and internationalisation, the
role of local managers is essential for monitoring the careers of
employees and reinforcing the advancement of their skills. For
2013, Sopra Group will maintain the training effort and active
leadership of local managers.

2.2.5. REMUNERATION AND TRENDS

In order to support the Group's growth, Sopra seeks to attract,
motivate and retain its employees by providing them with consistent
remuneration and equal treatment.


--- Page 29 ---

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

Backed by the employee assessment system, the remuneration
policy is individualised and is based on objective criteria.

The process for adjusting remuneration is based on the one hand
on the assessment system described above and on the other hand
‘on the HR cycles that are organised each year.

2.3. Work organisation

All Sopra Group entities comply with applicable local laws as well as
business sector practices in the countries in question

In France, when permitted by the services or project concerned,
Sopra Group approves employee requests for part-time work. Such
requests are generally authorised for renewable terms of between
six and twelve months. Part-time employees accounted for 6% of
Sopra’s workforce at 31 December 2012.

Specific work organisation mechanisms are put in place for
employees under contractual commitments entered into with
clients. These mechanisms relate to on-call duties and the 24-hour
hotline.

The absenteeism rate at Sopra Group increased slightly in 2012
(2.14%) relative to 2011 (2.08%). This rate is nevertheless lower
than the average for the sector.

2.4. Employee relations

In France, the organisation of Sopra Group's employee representative
bodies is structured around a central works council in the context
of the existing employee representative body "’ with its former
subsidiary Axway Software (in which Sopra Group has a 26.02%
equity interest), a local works council, employee representatives at
some twenty sites and eleven health, safety and working conditions
committees.

In 2012, the central works council met five times, the Sopra Group
works council was convened for twelve ordinary meetings and eight
extraordinary meetings. The health, safety and working conditions
committees met four times in the year to discuss ordinary business
and occasionally for extraordinary discussions relating in particular
to the layout of the work areas and questionnaires/surveys with
regard to draft agreements on stress at work.

Mandatory annual negotiations were held with the employee
representative bodies. In this regard, agreements on profit sharing
and on the employee savings and incentive plan were renewed in
2012. Negotiations also led to an agreement in favour of hiring the
disabled, an agreement on the allotment of shares in connection
with the award of bonus shares to all Group employees and a
number of agreements on employee representation in anticipation
of the professional elections planned in March and April 2013.

As part of a group-wide agreement, the trade unions have the
option to send monthly and quarterly notices to all staff via the
Sopra Group intranet. Similarly, under a provision of the internal
rules of the Sopra Group works council, the elected members of
this committee may issue monthly information.

In 2013, Sopra Group will hold its professional elections in March
and April. At the outcome of these elections, the Sopra Banking
Software subsidiary will have its own works council and employee
representatives. Sopra Group will retain one works council and
several employee representatives.

2.5. Non-discrimination principles

Sopra Group's policy with regard to fighting discrimination is
consistent with its proactive approach to promoting diversity.

To support these commitments, in September 2012 Sopra Group
created a dedicated structure aimed at spearheading and guiding
the agreements and action plans relating to corporate social
responsibility. These initiatives include in particular the hiring of
disabled employees, professional equality between women and
men, the integration of young workers, and support to senior
employees. Various guidelines, objectives and policies have been
defined for these areas and are specified in agreements or action
plans.

DISABLED EMPLOYEES

In 2012, Sopra Group signed an agreement to promote the
employment of people with disabilities and created Mission
Handicap. In accordance with this agreement, Sopra Group
structured its actions around five areas of priority:

= recruitment: Sopra established an organisation to search for
and track candidates and management tools for job applicants
(CV libraries, multiposting, etc.). The Group signed essential
partnership agreements (Adapt, Tremplin). In 2012, Sopra Group
participated in 14 external events (exhibitions, forums, week-
long events dedicated to hiring the disabled);

employment retention: Sopra implemented an intranet to
promote the request process for RQTH, a system that recognises
quality concerns for disabled workers, with the use of an
anonymous information systems tool;

training and raising awareness: The Group implemented a
dedicated intranet site for employees to be used to communicate
the actions of Mission Handicap. In addition, the first training
sessions were launched for HR officers in the last quarter of
2012;

protected workers sector: Sopra continued its development of
recourse to the protected workers sector and its partnership with
UNEA, the national union for employers adapted to working
with the disabled. In 2013, the Group will deploy a procurement
process to make it easier to search for, identify and integrate
adapted enterprises in requests for proposals from suppliers;

= support to technical development: The Group continued its
operational and financial support to the Tadeo ") project and
identified other projects for 2013 such as Aurevi

Sopra’s employment rate of disabled people was 0.87% in France at
31 December 2012. The slight decline in this rate was attributable
to the growth in the Group's workforce and acquisitions completed
during the year. Mission Handicap and its action programme
will help Sopra Group increase the employment rate of disabled
workers in 2013.

The workforce numbers used are calculated according to the rules defined by AGEFIPH,
an organisation that promotes professional integration of the disabled. Not all people
benefiting from the employment obligation are accounted for in this calculation

In 2013 Sopra Group will continue its policy of promoting the
hiring of disabled people. Raising employee awareness of this issue
is at the heart of its approach. Special training sessions will be
available to managers and HR officers and an e-learning module
will be deployed.

The progress objectives for 2013 are:

= action on hiring: to reach 65% of the 2012-2014 plan objective;

= job retention: to double the number of recognitions;

= training: to train 100% of HR officers;

= raising awareness: to cover 25% of management;

= protected workers sector: to double revenue;

= support to technical development: to develop a new partnership
in this area.

In order to attain these progress objectives, several significant action

plans will be implemented, particularly through awareness-raising

campaigns among students (operation “TousHanScéne” organised

by Tremplin), internal awareness initiatives and support to RQTH,
and the deployment of e-learning modules, among others.

GENDER EQUALITY

With regard to professional equality between women and men,
the Group seeks to reinforce two priority areas: attracting more
female employees from engineering schools and being mindful of
non-discrimination in women’s career paths.

In 2012, Sopra Group continued its involvement in initiatives to
raise awareness, such as sponsorship of the EDHEC business school
all-female team sailing team competing in the Course Croisiére
EDHEC.

In terms of training and career management, the proportion of
women and men trained is consistent with the gender breakdown
of the workforce. The same is true for promotions.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

Sopra Group offers identical starting salaries to both male and
female applicants with identical qualifications, degrees, skills and
experience. In 2012, the differences in remuneration reported by
employee category between women and men remained within a
3% range.

These differences are analysed during salary assessment and job
review cycles.

Furthermore, in accordance with the agreement in effect, Sopra
Group ensures that people who have taken maternity or adoption
leave benefit from the same conditions for salary increases as all
company employees. A parenting guide was distributed via the
employee intranet to all staff members.

In 2013, Sopra Group will continue to improve the systems in place
to monitor equal treatment between women and men during
salary assessment cycles. For example, the kit sent to management
for salary reviews will be enhanced with comparative information

SENIORS

The transfer of knowledge and skills is a major component
of our policy in favour of older employees for the success of
intergenerational management at Sopra Group.

At 31 December 2012, as part of the Senior France plan, over 360
employees had benefited from an interview for the second half of
their careers.

In 2013, Sopra Group will be committed to rolling out the
Generation Contract, which is aimed at promoting the hiring of
young workers while retaining working seniors in jobs.

Sopra Group applies a social policy with the aim of safeguarding
the health and safety of each of its employees and treating
everyone in the workplace with dignity and respect.

The Group remains particularly attentive at all times to ensure
compliance with principles of equality, diversity and non-
discrimination, as much in relation to its recruitment practices as in
the development of its employees’ careers.

2.6.1. UPHOLDING THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION

As a participant in the United Nations Global Compact, Sopra
Group is committed to upholding the freedom of association and
recognising the right to collective bargaining. The Group reaffirmed
this commitment in its Ethics Charter published in 2012.

the recognition of employee representatives, Sopra Group makes
an effort to implement measures intended to improve professional
relations between the company and our employees.

2.6.2. REPUDIATION OF FORCED CHILD LABOUR

and the exploitation of children, forced labour and all other forms
of compulsory labour, particularly through its participation in the
United Nations Global Compact.

2.7. Health and safety

The information presented in this section relates to Sopra Group’s
operations in France

In 2012, Sopra Group continued its rescue and first-aid training
programme for all of its operating sites.

Along the lines of this training programme, the Group has installed
a number of defibrillators and organised training sessions on how
to use them.

In addition, the Group spearheaded an initiative to raise employee
awareness about preventing road accidents and rolled out a
platform for carpooling.

Sopra Group pursued its policy with regard to providing quality
layout of its work areas.

In collaboration with the health, safety and working conditions
committees, the Group disseminated questionnaires on workplace
wellbeing at some of its operating sites in order to identify
psychosocial risk factors and to initiate corrective actions.

2.8. Internal communications

Sopra Group has put in place a strong internal communications
plan to keep employees informed, keep them engaged and
promote exchanges within the Group. Actions are pursued at the
entity or Group level, or targeted to specific employee positions.

2.8.1. SYSTEM OF EXCHANGES

BETWEEN STAFF MEMBERS

Sopra Group’s monitoring system provides for a series of meetings
at the Group and entity levels on a yearly, monthly and weekly
basis.

Registration Document 2012 - Sopra Group

At the annual launch meeting, the year’s operational priorities and
the Group’s medium-term strategy are communicated to managers.
These aspects are then revisited during monthly meetings. In
addition, each entity holds two or three meetings a year bringing
together all staff. Lastly, each team holds weekly meetings.

2.8.2. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Staff members access Group information through the use of
various tools: the Group portal, which disseminates Sopra
Group’s latest news and refers readers to the different existing
intranets (Human Resources, Knowledge, Quality System, etc.);
the bimonthly electronic newsletter e-mailed directly to staff; the
Group's knowledge base and forum (with communities managed
directly by staff members).

Locally pertinent information is also disseminated by entity
managers through newsletters.

Furthermore, certain targeted populations (managers, assistants)
receive specific information via a monthly newsletter to review
business processes and reinforce best practices.

2.8.3. EMPLOYEE PERCEPTION SURVEY

In 2012, Sopra Group surveyed all of the Group’s employees in
France and abroad to gain insight into their perceptions of the
company. In total, 77% of the Group’s employees responded to this
survey. This extremely high response rate demonstrates the strong
level of engagement of Sopra employees and their commitment to
the Group.

The results indicated that a large portion of the employees
highlighted the Group's values, and in particular, team spirit, as an
asset that sets Sopra Group apart from the competition.

The employees identified areas of progress particularly relating
to knowledge sharing through the Enterprise Project and
the adaptation of tools and resources for the Group’s strong
development.

Executive Management has committed to communicating the
results in the first half of 2013 and will rely on the data from this
survey to support its development strategy.

Sopra Group’s ambition is to use this survey as a regular focus of
discussion to continue to achieve progress over the long term.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

Sopra Group's businesses involve travel to a considerable extent,
require significant infrastructure and IT equipment and produce
many documents. Furthermore, Sopra Group operates some thirty
sites in France, which necessitates the management of premises
suited to the specific activities pursued at each site. The need to
control our environmental impact has therefore become a key
factor in our management and production methods, and is covered
by a continuous improvement programme involving the relevant
functional divisions and their staff.

3.1. Taking into consideration
environmental impacts

In France, an eco-responsibility programme involving the active
participation of each and every Sopra Group employee ensures
that all staff members understand the important role they play
in reducing the environmental impact of our operations. At
Sopra Group we encourage employee initiatives in the area of
environmental protection and promote the avoidance of excess
consumption of non-renewable energy resources in our working
methods. A guide to eco-friendly behaviours was published and
distributed in early 2009 to raise awareness and help employees
in their day-to-day activities. Staff are regularly reminded of the
existence of this guide as well as the full set of complementary
Group initiatives under way. Correspondents at all sites are tasked
with ensuring the proper application of the relevant measures.

3.1.1. ORGANISATION TO TAKE INTO

CONSIDERATION ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

As part of Sopra Group’s Sustainable Development programme
in France, a number of functional departments have adopted the
Group’s approach to environmental issues and, along with the
Sustainable Development Department and under the responsibility
of Executive Management, are defining the company’s general
environmental policy. This policy is defined each year and summarised
in a memorandum that covers all of the major areas of Sopra
Group concerned. Each department involved in the environmental
policy spearheads its own actions. The environmental programme
as a whole is coordinated during meetings of the Sustainable
Development Committee.

The following three departments are more particularly involved in
the Group's environmental policy and have coordinated to manage
their plans for on-going progress:

Logistics

The main participants directly involved in the Group's environmental

programme are:

= the Director of the Logistics Department;

= an environmental actions coordination manager for the Logistics
department;

3.1.2. TRAINING AND INFORMATION
ON PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OFFERED
TO EMPLOYEES

Sopra Group organises an awareness programme for all employees
in France on managing the Group’s environmental impact.

The Group’s employees take part in the company’s approach to
eco-responsibility. A guide to eco-friendly behaviours was published
and distributed to all employees in 2009 to raise awareness of the
major environmental challenges in the Group's various business
lines. Sopra Group uses all its internal communication tools (Group
newsletter, intranet), on-site communications and a dedicated
email address to promote this awareness campaign.

A Sustainable Development series is routinely included in the
annual seminars offered to the Group’s managers worldwide for
the start of each new year.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

Our environmental responsibility commitments

This series was also included in 2012 in an information seminar
offered to Sopra Group assistants on the company’s sustainable
development activity.

In addition, all employees in France are further exposed to the
Group's environmental issues through a partnership initiated in
2012 with the French organisation of Green Cross, an international
association working for environmental sustainability.

Information on Sopra Group’s environmental programme is
disseminated in the orientation guide given to all new employees
who join the Group in France.

The main objectives for progress in 2013 relate to:

= augmenting the information provided to employees by updating
the guide to eco-friendly behaviours along with an information
campaign;

= rolling out the environmental responsibility programme at
Sopra’s international entities, including information on the
regulatory environment in each country and the management
requirements of the entities concerned.

3.2. Waste management

Various types of waste are sorted and processed by specialised
companies: waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE),
paper, consumable supplies (used ink cartridges and batteries) and
beverage cans.

MANAGEMENT OF WEEE

In 2012, Sopra Group worked with two companies to handle the
Group’s waste electrical and electronic equipment: ATF Gaia for
the Group's sites in the French provinces and Tricycle for its sites in
the Paris region.

ATF Gaia organises the collection of a major portion of the waste
electrical and electronic equipment from Annecy, where the Group
stores its computer equipment. IT-related waste from Sopra’s sites
in lle-de-France is managed by Tricycle, a company that specialises
in waste management and selective sorting, particularly for waste
electrical and electronic equipment. This WEEE management
organisation in two regions enables the Group to limit the
transport of inoperable or obsolete equipment.

ATF Gaia, the main service provider for WEEE management,
provides a high degree of traceability for IT-related waste and offers
several types of recycling:

= complete recycling of equipment;
= recycling of spare parts;
= recycling of computer components.

In addition, ATF Gaia securely destroys data disks and magnetic
cartridges.

For 2013, the Group’s main objective is to continue its IT-related
waste management programme with the service providers ATF Gaia
and Tricycle and to increase the amount of waste collected.

Registration Document 2012 - Sopra Group

| QUANTITIES OF WEEE IN FRANCE

2012 2011
Quantities of WEEE in kg (Paris region) 1,554 na.
Quantities of WEEE in kg excluding
re-use (outside Paris region) 2,956 na.
Total quantity of WEEE 4510V n.a.

PAPER WASTE MANAGEMENT

Sopra Group has implemented selective sorting of paper waste
at most of its sites in France. The goal of this selective sorting
policy is essentially to collect a major portion of the Group's
paper waste for recycling. Management of the selective sorting
operations is centralised for Sopra Group's Ile-de-France sites by
our service provider Tricycle. For the sites in France’s provinces, the
municipalities or service providers hired by Sopra Group directly
coordinate the selective sorting of the Group’s paper waste.

In 2012, in order to increase the volume of paper waste collected,
selective sorting was implemented in every office at a number of
sites. Sopra Group will continue this policy of selective sorting by
office at new sites in France in 2013.

WASTE MANAGEMENT OF CONSUMABLES

Selective sorting of consumable waste is organised in the same
manner as paper waste management.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

3.3. Sustainable use of resources

3.3.1. MANAGEMENT OF IT RESOURCES

IT resources are managed centrally by the IT Resources and Services
Department. This ensures that hardware is standardised and
shared, leading to energy savings.

By virtue of its activity of developing software and managing IT
projects on behalf of its clients, Sopra Group has a large number
of servers. These servers account for a large proportion of the
company’s environmental footprint (in terms of materials, energy
consumption and air-conditioning requirements). With the aim of
controlling economic and ecological costs, Sopra Group has for a
long time tightly managed its stock of servers by pooling hardware
and implementing solutions for reducing the amount of energy
consumed by workstations.

Management of energy consumption

In early 2009, Sopra Group decided to implement an improved
energy management model, and embarked on harmonising
standards applied to all equipment across the Group, in particular
by ensuring that all workstation screens enter sleep mode after
fifteen minutes and by extending the use of standby mode. This
programme has been renewed by the Group and deployed to all
subsidiaries. It limits Sopra’s energy consumption when employees
are not using their computers for extended periods during the day.
The Group also raises awareness on a regular basis via the intranet
to encourage employees to shut down their computers or activate
sleep mode when not using their computers for long periods.

With regard to photocopiers and printers, Sopra Group has
developed a process to streamline the number of devices and
promote sensible use of consumable supplies. In this regard,
networking is considered as a way of reducing the number
of devices, since photocopiers can function as both printers
and scanners (scan to email). As of 2010, 80% of the Group's
photocopiers were networked. Furthermore, virtually all the Group's
photocopiers support double-sided printing

Virtualisation of IT infrastructure

One of the ways in which Sopra Group reduces its carbon footprint
is by opting for the virtualisation of its IT infrastructure. This
technology allows for IT centres to pool and optimise the use of
their equipment resources.

The aims of this approach are reflected in

= an increase in processing capacity by reducing the number of
physical machines and thereby energy consumption;

= the acquisition of more compact machines using less energy;

= significant space savings in IT centres by limiting the need to
build extensions;

= extensions to the life span of IT equipment.

Our environmental responsibility commitments

Management of the installed base of IT equipment

Sopra Group manages its installed base of IT equipment in
application of very precise guidelines with a view to controlling
costs and protecting the environment.

All IT equipment used by Sopra Group is listed in a database
managed using HP’s AssetCenter product. Technical, financial and
usage information is continually updated over the equipment's life
cycle, allowing the Group both to optimise equipment life spans and
to ensure proper recycling when equipment reaches its end of life.

The quality of information collected ensures effective management
of Sopra Group's installed base of equipment. The only pieces of
equipment subject to replacement are those that become obsolete
or whose use no longer corresponds to Sopra Group’s business
standards.

Even once an item of equipment has been removed and recycled,
Sopra Group maintains information relating to its final destination
in its database. In order to ensure that electrical and electronic
equipment reaching the end of its useful life is managed in
an ecologically friendly manner, Sopra Group sells most of its
equipment to a certified organisation. In addition, 15% of PCs
coming to the end of their useful lives are donated to educational
institutions or charitable associations.

Life span of IT equipment

Sopra Group used the opportunity presented by Dell’s overhaul of
its product line to take into account new environmental criteria
in the selection of the equipment used by its employees. Desktop
and laptop computers in this range offer improved performance
and consume less energy. Since 2009, Sopra Group has therefore
replaced a major portion of its business computer equipment in
favour of more energy-efficient models. At the same time, one of
the key principles implemented over the last several years has been
to extend the life of the equipment.

Consequently, replacing the IT equipment with more energy-efficient
computers and a policy of extending the life of this equipment help
to significantly reduce the Group's environmental impact.

IT equipment is inventoried on a regular basis both physically by the
Group's technical teams and remotely by data collection from the
network, ensuring the company’s ability to track the equipment.

| LIFE SPAN OF IT EQUIPMENT

2012 2011
Life span of IT equipment 2.89% (LPT ")

* significant portion of the Group’s IT equipment was replaced in 2011 and 2012, which
explains the marked decline in life span between 2011 and 2012.

3.3.2. PAPERLESS PROCESSES

For several years, Sopra Group has encouraged the wider use
of paperless processes by deploying tools permitting electronic
document management and by frequently urging its employees to
avoid printing whenever possible. The Group implements concrete
measures to encourage the use of paperless processes and raises
awareness among employees to reduce the use of paper and the
energy consumed by printing. Paperless processes also help to
reduce the physical delivery of documents and, last but not least,
less paper used for printing means less waste to be processed

The Group’s paperless processes involve the various internal
newsletters published by Sopra Group (Group newsletter and
newsletters of the functional and operational divisions distributed
via the intranet), monthly activity reports produced by each
employee; the management of paid leave and absences, IT
requests, purchases and travel invoices.

New projects in this area, including offering paperless pay
statements and expense accounts, were initiated in 2012 for rollout
in 2013. Employees who wish to receive a paperless version of their
pay statements may do so via a secure Digiposte digital lockbox
managed in partnership with the French postal service.

3.3.3. MANAGEMENT OF COMMUTER JOURNEYS
AND BUSINESS TRAVEL

Policy on work-related travel

Sopra Group has locations both in France and abroad. In France,
the Group has many sites located throughout the country. Its clients

Registration Document 2012 - Sopra Group

are themselves located all over France and abroad. Sopra Group has
also developed offshore Service Centres in Spain, Morocco and
India. All of the above generates a large amount of travel, which of
course has an impact on the environment.

Consequently, several years ago the Group introduced an initiative

to reduce the amount of travel and its environmental impact by

adopting the use of a videoconferencing system and promoting the
most environmentally-friendly means of transport (train) whenever
possible.

In this regard, and in order to reduce the amount of travel, Sopra

Group implemented an action plan on several fronts:

a limiting travel for internal and external meetings through the use
of videoconferencing equipment at the majority of the Group's
sites;

= encouraging the use of the most eco-friendly means of transport
whenever possible, particularly for trips in France or daily
commutes to client locations.

An annual memorandum distributed to the entire management

team to implement this action plan dictates the principles of the

Group’s travel policy.

Monitoring the Group's carbon footprint related

to business travel

In order to identify areas in need of improvement, for the last
three years Sopra Group has monitored its carbon footprint
from employee commuting and business travel by air, train and
automobile. This carbon footprint assessment helps to identify
ways the Group can limit the use of means of transport that cause
the most pollution. This is particularly relevant in France, where
train travel to the Group’s multiple sites can help to reduce CO
emissions.

Centralised travel management

To better manage and centralise the Group’s business travel,
business trips in France are for the most part managed by two
service providers: a travel agency for air and train travel, and a car
rental company.

The use of personal vehicles for long-distance business travel in
France is limited to the requirements of the department and when
train and air travel are not appropriate


--- Page 37 ---

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

With respect to work-related travel over short distances, the used
of taxis and personal vehicles is discouraged when public transport
is easily accessible.

Group guidelines for work-related travel are disseminated via the
Sopra Group intranet and apply to all staff.

In 2013, Sopra Group will continue its policy of limiting
business travel and will make an effort to optimise the use of
videoconferencing systems.

3.3.4. MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS PREMISES

At all of its sites in France and, depending on national regulations,
for its operations outside France, Sopra Group favours the
application of measures for the protection of the environment

= furnishing of premises with ergonomic workstations enhancing
the quality of working conditions for its staff. One way in which
this approach has been applied for some thirty years by the
Group is to ensure that each workstation has direct access to
daylight;

installation of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly
heating and air-conditioning systems whenever these systems
require replacement;

preventive maintenance of installations to conserve energy;

use of non-toxic and non-hazardous products by the cleaning
services;

installation of water fountains, directly connected to the drinking
water distribution network, with the aim of reducing plastic
bottle use;

efforts to raise the awareness of employees as to the importance
of applying the best practices contained in the Group’s guide to
eco-friendly behaviours;

commitment by site managers to observe and encourage respect
for the environment and good practice on a day-to-day basis. In
assuming direct day-to-day responsibility for waste separation at
sites, these managers promote best practices and communicate
information to staff members as necessary. They also verify
the gradual installation of low-energy devices as equipment is
replaced.

Our environmental responsibility commitments

With regard to Sopra Group’s strategies concerning new business
premises, the company’s policy is to favour buildings eligible for
the new RT 2012 (2012 thermal regulations), BBC (low energy-
consumption buildings) and HQE® (High environmental quality)
standards. These choices are made first and foremost to remain
consistent with the criteria for advancing the quality of Sopra
Group’s work environment.

New standards for construction of new sites

In France's Rhéne-Alpes region, in the city of Limonest, an
8,000 m? building is being completed that has been HQE® and
BBC certified. In mid-2013, the employees of Sopra Group's
regional headquarters will move into this new building.

In order to meet the needs of the Group’s strong business
growth in the Toulouse region, construction will begin in 2013
on a building that will meet the new RT 2012 environmental
standards. This new site will house a portion of the employees
in Sopra’s Midi-Pyrénées region in 2014.

Water consumption

With regard to water consumption, Sopra only uses water from
the municipal water system and mainly for sanitary use. The precise
assessment of water consumption for all of the Group’s operations
in France is difficult to obtain, since it depends on the utility
management system readings made available by Sopra Group's
various lessors. However, Sopra Group intends to intensify its efforts
in order to obtain this information.

friendly behaviours and Group communication tools. Campaigns
will continue in 2013 to encourage employees to limit energy
consumption in the course of their day-to-day activities.

Sopra Group continued to be a major driver of growth in regional
employment in 2012, recruiting 1,676 new employees in France,
with 1,100 of these in the provinces.

Sopra Group has 9,386 employees in France, two thirds of whom
are based at the company’s provincial sites.

To serve its clients and meet their needs as effectively as possible,
Sopra Group has developed regional service centres and boosted its
workforce at its regional sites. This policy has led to the creation of
a large number of new positions and the recruitment of significant
numbers of new staff into the Group’s regional entities.

In 2012, regular awareness campaigns to limit printing led to a

4.1.2. RELATIONS WITH LOCAL POPULATIONS

IN INDIA
As a responsible company, Sopra Group India (SGI), which employs
more than a thousand people in India (in Noida and Bangalore), has
for several years been running aid programmes for underprivileged
populations and people with disabilities.
The Yogdaan platform, set up by SGI in 2011, is intended to bring
together all activities falling within the remit of corporate social
responsibility (CSR).

\Yogdaan

In August 2012, a new recognised body was formed: Sopra Group
India Yogdaan Trust. This body, which is funded via monthly
contributions from more than 900 SGI employees, with support
from the company, is now responsible for implementing all of SGI's
CSR-related activities.

Furthermore, more than 45 active employees belonging to
the Yogdaan team voluntarily took part in Sopra Group India
humanitarian initiatives in 2012.
In 2012, Yogdaan’s activities were focused around five key areas,
which are outlined below:
= education for the underprivileged.
In conjunction with the OM Foundation school, Yogdaan Trust
launched a project named “Encouraging education through
regular volunteering”. The project aims to provide students with
help in the areas of arts and crafts, dance, public speaking and
sport.

4.2. Responsible purchasing
charter and supplier CSR
assessment

4.2.1. RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING CHARTER

Sopra Group is particularly attentive to the issue of purchasing
that complies with sustainable development goals. Sopra Group
is therefore committed to purchasing responsibly and applying a
supplier and service provider selection policy that fully complies with
the principles laid down in the United Nations Global Compact, of
which Sopra Group is a signatory. Sopra Group defined a formal
responsible purchasing policy as long ago as 2010. In 2011, the
Group drew up a responsible purchasing charter based on the key
principles found in the Global Compact. The charter formalises
the Group's values in relation to corporate social responsibility
and its commitment to sustainable development in its purchasing
processes.

The responsible purchasing charter sets out fundamental principles
of fair and transparent purchasing and establishes the roles and
responsibilities of the purchasing network.

The charter is sent out to all regular suppliers to gain their buy-in. It
formalises the Group’s values in terms of sustainable development
and draws on the ten principles laid down in the United Nations
Global Compact.

4.2.2. SUPPLIER CSR ASSESSMENT Vv.

In 2011, a pilot project was launched in France to assess
key suppliers’ responsibility in respect of human resources, the
environment and society.

In 2012, the guiding principles for assessing responsibility in these
areas were approved and the assessment process and resources to
be used in that process were finalised.

Sopra Group's responsible purchasing charter and CSR assessment
questionnaire were sent to regular French suppliers of the
Purchasing and Logistics Department (excluding lessors) and the IT
Resources and Security Department.

The CSR assessment questionnaire, which was only sent to tier 1
suppliers“, measures suppliers’ level of commitment in three areas:
human resources, the environment and society. A scoring system
ranks each supplier’s answers on a scale of values.

This programme, piloted within the Sustainable Development
Department, involves the Purchasing, Logistics, and IT Resources
and Security (ITR&S) Departments.

assessed (%) 62% | 100% 73% 74%

Progress targets for 2013 are aimed at assessing all tier 1
suppliers and including lessors within the scope of the assessment
programme. An awareness process will also be initiated among
those suppliers achieving low CSR scores to encourage them to
draw up CSR improvement plans.

As regards subcontracting, a pilot CSR assessment project was
launched among a panel of French subcontractors in late 2012.
If this pilot progresses satisfactorily, a CSR assessment programme
will be rolled out among tier 1 subcontractors from 2013 onwards.

(1) A tier 1 supplier is a supplier that transacts a certain volume of sales with Sopra Group andior undertakes sensitive activities in the areas of human resources (e.g. temporary recruitment) or the

environment (e.g. premises maintenance).

4.3. Fair commercial practices

Sopra Group’s main priority in carrying on its day-to-day activities
has always been to observe business ethics. This requirement is
formalised in Sopra Group’s Charter of Ethics, which is aligned
with the Group's aim of behaving transparently, equitably and
fairly towards all its stakeholders: clients, employees, shareholders,
partners, suppliers and players within civil society.

This charter is founded on compliance with legislation and
regulations in all countries in which the Group operates, and on
the Group's commitments to carry on its business as efficiently and
effectively as possible.

In particular, Sopra Group’s Charter of Ethics aims to lay down
ethical principles that will help the Group pursue fair and
transparent economic growth with its clients, partners and
suppliers, both in its relationships and in its working practices

Sopra Group does not tolerate any form of corruption or abuse
intended to derive a commercial advantage.

In carrying on its business, Sopra Group is committed to ensuring
that the Group and its employees

= work to prevent all forms of active or passive corruption, whether
direct or indirect;

= abide by competition rules;

= maintain the confidentiality of information to which employees
have access in the course of their duties and activities within the
Group.

Sopra Group is also committed to avoiding personal conflicts of
interest that are contrary to the Group's best interests.

The Charter of Ethics is supported by Sopra Group management,
which is responsible for ensuring that these rules are observed. The
charter applies to all Group employees in France to ensure that they
perform their duties effectively.

The charter is set to be rolled out to international entities in
2013, taking into account specific regulations in each country and
charters already in force within those entities.

4.4. Quality and client satisfaction

Client satisfaction is closely linked to both the quality of the
products and services provided by Sopra Group and the use and
continuous improvement of a quality management system.

The quality policy is backed by a high level of commitment from
Sopra Group’s Executive Committee, with the main focus being
on meeting clients’ requirements while continuing to deliver
the strong performance that ensures that the Group retains the
freedom it needs to offer appropriate solutions to its clients.

Sopra Group's Quality System is the embodiment of this quality policy.
Its end goal is not only to correct compliance defects or problems as
they arise, but to safeguard against such defects and problems and to
continuously improve Sopra Group's processes so that they are always
efficient, competitive and relevant to clients’ expectations.

In order to monitor client needs more closely, Sopra Group plans to
periodically conduct targeted satisfaction surveys, starting in 2013.

Our responsibility to society

4.4.1. CLIENT INVOLVEMENT IN PROCESSES

In the context of projects, Sopra Group’s teams share with clients
their approach to production, the resources and organisation
necessary to ensure the quality of services or deliverables. Shared
indicators may also be put in place, allowing for the measurement
of satisfaction in accordance with mutually agreed requirements
and/or satisfaction as perceived by the various client and Sopra
Group stakeholders.

4.4.2. QUALITY CERTIFICATION

All Sopra Group entities (in Europe and India) have been certified
to ISO 9001 by accredited organisations. This certification
demonstrates the Group's desire to increase client satisfaction by
taking into account changes in the Group’s operating environment
and continuously improving Group processes.

4.4.3. DEVELOPING THE QUALITY SYSTEM

Sopra Group updated its multi-location production model in 2012
to better reflect clients’ expectations and challenges. The criteria
used to apportion work between more than one production site
take into account not only project type, project life cycle and
financial considerations, but also skills availability and risks.

Some project activities may be carried out in service centres in
France, in Europe or outside Europe.

The main goal of a service centre is to optimise projects and the
quality of delivery. Such a centre is characterised by a striving for
excellence in production and industrialisation and progress for
junior production staff.

Overall quality control within a multi-location production
environment remains subject to the Group’s standard governance
rules.

Work to further refine the Group’s fundamental principles and
their operational application in the form of project procedures will
continue in 2013 with the aim of harmonising practices in relation
to multi-location projects.

4.4.4. ATTENTIVENESS TO CLIENTS’ NEEDS
AND MEASUREMENT OF CLIENT SATISFACTION

All information channels are used to ensure client satisfaction:

= staff responsible for the Group’s Offerings and Innovation
functions keep a constant watch on market developments and
help extend and improve Sopra Group’s range of services;

= management and/or sales teams meet regularly with clients
involved with Sopra Group in projects or for whom the Group
supplies industry-specific personnel to assist at the local level;

= project steering committees usually meet once monthly to assess
client satisfaction against any indicators established for the
project;

= reports written up by team members at the end of projects are
also used to refine this assessment system.

4.5. Relations with persons
and organisations
with a stake in the business

4.5.1. EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIP POLICY

Given its recruitment objectives, according to which 70% of the
targeted population consists of either engineers or managers
taking on their first position of this type or those with less than
two years of managerial experience, Sopra Group maintains strong
partnerships with educational institutions both in the Paris region
and in the French provinces. This policy, pursued under the Group’s
Educational Partnership plan, is grounded in local action. Its main
aims are to:

= raise the profile of Sopra Group, its professions and its values;

m improve the sourcing of interns, work-study personnel and
applicants for permanent positions;

= facilitate the recruitment of young graduates.

The Educational Partnership plan allows Sopra Group to take an
active part in major events in the life of educational institutions at
all levels:

= school management (boards of directors, involvement in
foundations and expert panels, sponsorship of classes, etc.);

= teaching staff (corporate chairs, training, feedback, industrial
projects, etc.);

m students (success stories, round table discussions, lectures,
simulated interviews, graduation ceremonies, forums, company
visits, sponsorship of associations, etc.).

In this context, Sopra Group has put in place an organisational
structure between the Human Resources Department and the
company’s operating units that is designed to help them work
together more closely and share out activities.

In 2012, Sopra Group undertook more than 350 activities with
around 120 partner schools and universities, 70% of which were
in the provinces.

Sopra Group partners with the 44*" EDHEC Cruising Race
For the sixth consecutive year, Sopra Group sponsored the
leading European sports event for students: the EDHEC Cruising
Race, held in April 2012 in La Rochelle.

Examples of newactivities undertaken with schoolsin2012

= Sopra Group financed the Team Voile Centrale Nantes
association and the BRIO project, with the aim of supporting
students from modest backgrounds by helping them find out
about higher education options and cultural projects such as
sailing for beginners.

= Sopra Group sponsored Cheer Up, an association that helps
young cancer patients with their personal and professional plans.
In connection with the EDHEC Cruising Race, the association
trained a crew to teach them about the basics of sailing and
give them the opportunity to experience a sports competition

Registration Document 2012 - Sopra Group

In order to serve Sopra Group's growth and value ambitions, in
2013 the Recruitment Department will maintain the momentum
already built up through the school relations policy by:

= strengthening the school stakeholder scheme, particularly in the
lle-de-France region, as is already happening in other regions;

= placing the priority on content-based activities that provide
opportunities to explain the Group’s business to students.

Sopra Group will also work to develop new work/study curricula
to support changes in this area in the Group’s partner schools and
universities.

These progress targets are included in the annual action plan that
underpins Sopra Group's school relations policy. For the 2012-2013
academic year, Sopra Group plans to undertake more than 400
activities with around 140 partner schools and universities.

4.5.2. STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE

Sopra Group's commitment to the United Nations Global Compact
is aligned with the Group’s aim of behaving transparently,
equitably and fairly towards all its stakeholders: clients, employees,
shareholders, subcontractors, suppliers, partners and players within
civil society.

It is in this spirit of dialogue and transparency that Sopra Group
has, in France, incorporated the sustainable development and
corporate social responsibility dimensions into its relationships with
its stakeholders. For example, the 2012 Sustainable Development
and Corporate Social Responsibility Report was designed to meet
this demand for transparency and information in the Group’s
dealings with its stakeholders. The report, which mainly focuses
on the Group's French businesses, will be expanded each year to
include reporting information about international entities.

An independent third party was appointed by Sopra Group to check
that all information required under Article 225 of the “Grenelle 2”
Act (as listed in Article R225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code)
was included and to verify a selection of information indicated by
the symbol V. The verification report can be found on pages 85 and
86 of this report.

Clients

For many years, Sopra Group has succeeded in building lasting
relationships with its clients, whom it supports in their major
transformation programmes. In order to achieve this, the Group
has developed a set of values backed by a code of professional
ethics and relies on established fundamentals that govern the
Group's operations and service activities on an ongoing basis.

The values that have shaped the Group’s development since
its formation, in particular the priority placed on client service,
choosing quality and professional excellence, have led it to
constantly improve the relevance and quality of its services for the
benefit of its clients.

This approach to managing client relationships and responsibilities
has enabled Sopra Group to achieve preferred partner status with a
number of major organisations that have trusted the Group to help
them grow for a number of years and continue to do so.

Sopra Group aims to keep its clients informed of its commitments
in the area of corporate social responsibility by communicating
frequently about progress made through improvement measures
put in place. Clients are themselves also encouraged, whenever


--- Page 43 ---

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

possible, to join with the Group in implementing actions to reduce
our combined carbon footprint. This may involve favouring the use
of videoconferencing technology instead of meetings requiring
travel or the use of paperless processes for all documents related
to the monitoring of projects conducted by Sopra Group on their
behalf.

Employees

Sopra Group complies with European and French social legislation,
collective bargaining agreements in each of the countries where it
operates and recognises the right to trade union representation in
all countries concerned.

The Group applies a social policy with the aim of safeguarding the
health and safety of each of its employees and treating everyone in
the workplace with dignity and respect.

Sopra Group remains particularly attentive at all times to ensure
compliance with principles of equality, diversity and non-
discrimination, as much in relation to its recruitment practices as in
the development of its employees’ careers.

To keep its staff informed of actions and events related to the life
of the Group and its development, Sopra Group has put in place a
range of communications tools and procedures.

The perception survey conducted by Sopra Group among its
employees in 2012 forms an essential component of the Group's
range of tools for communicating with staff.

Furthermore, Group employees in France are regularly made aware
of issues related to sustainable development and corporate social
responsibility and involved in Sopra Group’s improvement process
and associated actions.

Shareholders

Sopra Group shares have been listed on Segment B of NYSE
Euronext Paris since 1990.

This Sustainable Development and Corporate Social Responsibility
Report is published within the management report in order to
share information about the Group’s sustainable development
and corporate social responsibility approach and its improvement
efforts in France. In accordance with French legislation, Sopra
Group is committed to communicating its progress and the
relevant performance indicators every year in the three areas in
question: human resources, the environment and society.

Sopra Group is constantly working to maintain a relationship of
trust and transparency with its shareholders; as such, it regularly
issues communications to shareholders, institutional investors and
financial analysts. These communications include both financial
and non-financial information about the Group.

In accordance with the Group’s obligations, recommendations
issued by stock exchange authorities and market best practice,
the Group’s communications with the financial community are
punctuated by the release of quarterly, interim and full-year
financial information.

Our responsibility to society

Sopra Group has for many years held various types of meetings
to share its strategy, financial performance and outlook with this
audience. Such meetings include the following:

= Shareholders’ General Meetings;
= full-year and interim results announcements.

Sopra Group has also developed a Group finance site
(www.finance.sopragroup.com) in French and English to facilitate
access to published market information.

Dialogue is also encouraged via a dedicated e-mail address,
investors@sopragroup.com.

Subcontractors

Sopra Group's expertise covers consulting, technology services
and software vending on the one hand, and associated services
(training, organisation, support and maintenance) on the other
hand.

Sopra Group may make use of subcontractors in cases where its
commitments cover activities or services that fall outside its usual
scope of activity, or where specific expertise is needed within a
given project.

A procedure within the Quality Procedures Guide describes in detail
how Sopra Group draws up subcontractor requirements, chooses
subcontractors, enters into subcontracting agreements, manages
services delivered by subcontractors, monitors the quality of those
services and accepts them. A report on the work performed by
subcontractors is then prepared.

Where external skills are used, any subcontractors to whom work
is entrusted remain under the responsibility of Sopra Group. Their
services are subject to the same level of monitoring and control
as services delivered by other members of the Sopra Group team.

In 2012, a pilot project was launched to assess subcontractors’
CSR performance, drawing on the supplier assessment programme
introduced in France in 2011.

Suppliers

The Procurement Department verifies that its suppliers and service
providers share Sopra Group's values in the area of corporate social
responsibility. Throughout the selection process and even once
the business relationship has been established, this department
monitors risk exposure on an ongoing basis.

In order to ensure that its suppliers took into account sustainable
development issues, Sopra Group continued with its supplier
CSR assessment programme in 2012. Details can be found in
section 4.2 of this chapter, “Responsible purchasing charter and
supplier CSR assessment”

Partnerships

Sopra Group's partnership strategy involves working with major
software developers and publishers to provide the Group’s clients
with market-leading solutions, whether for their business processes
or their information systems. This strategy has resulted in alliances
and offerings that create value for the Group’s clients. Partnerships
are also key to Sopra Group's innovation, training and knowledge
management programmes, and play a role in project methodology
and management, so as to ensure a high level of service.

2012 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

Our responsibility to society

The Group's relationship with its partners involves all levels of
Group management and sales functions, and permeates its
consulting, technology services and software vending businesses in
every country in which Sopra Group operates.

The Group’s four strategic partners are Microsoft, IBM Software,
SAP and Oracle. Each of these partnerships is supervised by an
Advocate, who is a member of the Group’s Executive Committee,
and by an Alliance Manager, who is responsible for day-to-day
coordination of all aspects of relations with the partner. In addition
to these strategic partnerships, Sopra Group enters into industry-
specific and technology partnerships, managed and implemented
by the Group’s Industry Solutions teams.

Civil society

Jean Mounet, a member of Sopra Group’s Board of Directors, is
Executive Chairman of the Observatoire du numérique (Digital
Observatory) and a member of the Strategic Committee for the
ICTS industry “.

Created in late 2011 by the minister with responsibility for the
digital economy, the Observatoire du numérique exists to highlight
the scale and real impact of the digital sector on the economy as
a whole and society at large. The Observatoire du numérique acts
as a central repository for all data on the digital economy so that
this data can be used by public authorities, economic agents and
the public more generally. The Observatoire's Strategic Orientation
Committee has formed seven working groups, including an
“Employment, Training and CSR” working group.

4.5.3. PARTNERSHIP AND SPONSORSHIP ACTIVITIES

In France, Sopra Group has put in place sponsorship activities
focused around two key areas: humanitarian initiatives with Planéte
Urgence and the environment with Green Cross France & Territoires.
At an international level, the Group’s other entities have also
implemented a large number of humanitarian initiatives.

As well as information on activities in India set out in section 4.1
of this report, “Regional impact of activities”, the Group's 2013
reporting will include information on activities undertaken by other
international entities.

Planéte Urgence V

URGENCE

NOUS VOUS AIDONS A AGIR

The Group's partnership with Planéte Urgence, which dates back to
2008, continued in 2012.

As part of this partnership, 11 employees of Sopra Group France
used paid leave for humanitarian purposes under the “Congé
Solidaire” programme in 2012.

Planéte Urgence is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that
has been working for over ten years with local NGOs operating in
developing countries, including in particular sub-Saharan Africa,
Haiti, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal.

(1) ICTS: information and communication technologies and services.

Registration Document 2012 - Sopra Group

Sopra Group's participation in the Congé Solidaire programme
organised by Planéte Urgence is a contribution to the work of this
NGO shared by the company and the interested employee.

Under this innovative programme, volunteer employees are able to
use their paid holidays to provide assistance in various developing
countries.

The humanitarian missions proposed by Sopra Group to its
employees directly relate to their professional experience. The
company’s participation involves the payment of travel expenses,
training and administrative fees.

The Congé Solidaire programme is a rewarding new way for
employees to put their free time to good use, and Sopra Group is
keen to encourage it through its partnership with Planéte Urgence.

Following the success of the Planéte Urgence programme and
the number of in-house applications, Sopra Group is planning
to step up its involvement. In 2013, 20 employees will have the
opportunity to participate in the programme.

Green Cross France & Territoires V

_
GREEN
CROSS

France &
Territoires

In 2012, Sopra Group decided to focus its commitment to
the environment on major issues, including in particular those
linked to water-related issues. The Group therefore decided to
support Green Cross France & Territoires (GCFT), an association
dedicated to reinforcing the general programmes run by Green
Cross International. GCFT also runs various activities including
the development of regional and national water-related advocacy
programmes. Green Cross works in more than 30 countries,
focusing its activities on the relationship between poverty, security
and the environment. Green Cross seeks to tackle both the causes
and the environmental consequences of wars and conflicts. The
ONG carries out environmental analyses and surveys, defends the
sustainable management and use of natural resources, and helps
inform and educate the public about these issues.

Sopra Group's support takes two forms: a financial donation to the
association to help it expand its activities and skills sponsorship in
support of internal or external GCFT projects.

In 2012, this Sopra Group/GCFT skills sponsorship formed part
of an overall package of advice and support in relation to various
internal projects within the association, as well as an external
environmental project supported by GCFT. Sopra Group made its
consulting expertise available for a large-scale project launched
by GCFT in 2012, “Transition towards a sustainable pig sector in
Brittany”. GCFT is working to revitalise the sector from producers
right through to consumers, and has established requirements that
provide guarantees in relation to environmental protection and
animal welfare and ensure a fair and stable income for breeders

In 2012, seven members of Sopra Group management and staff
from outside the Sustainable Development Department were
involved in skills sponsorship.

In 2013, Sopra Group is repeating its financial sponsorship and
continuing with skills sponsorship in connection with the project
“Transition towards a sustainable pig sector in Brittany”.

4.5.4. HUMANITARIAN INITIATIVES ORGANISED
BY EMPLOYEES IN FRANCE

In France, in addition to initiatives managed by the Group,
employees have joined forces to undertake humanitarian initiatives.
For example, employees were behind two types of initiative in 2012.

Blood donation drives

For several years, employees have been organising blood donation
drives, at their own initiative and with the help of Sopra Group.
These drives, which take place within the framework of the Group's
activities, are an opportunity to encourage other employees to give
blood and raise awareness of the vital need for this humanitarian

GRI and ISO 26000

initiative. For example, local employees at the Nantes site organised
several blood donation drives in 2012.

Initiatives in favour of people with disabilities

Other humanitarian initiatives were also undertaken in 2012 by
Group employees in France. For example, a race was organised in
Strasbourg in May 2012 involving runners from the Association
des aveugles et amblyopes d‘Alsace et de Lorraine (Alsace-Lorraine
Association for the Blind and Amblyopic/AAAL).

The idea behind the race was to pair up sighted and blind runners
in a shared sporting endeavour.

In Annecy, Group employees have for several years taken part
in an event organised by the local council, “Annecy court pour
handisport” ("Annecy runs in support of disabled sports”). The
event's partners recognise this fine collective effort by awarding a
cash sum to Annecy’s disabled sports association

At an international level, employees of Group entities have also
taken part in a large number of humanitarian initiatives. The
Group’s 2013 reporting will include information about these
initiatives.
