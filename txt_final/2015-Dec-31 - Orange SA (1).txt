The Group
Overview

1.1. Overview

Orange is one of the world’s leading telecommunications operators
with revenues of 40 billion euros and 156,000 employees worldwide
(including 97 000 in France) at December 31, 2015. With operations
in 28 countries, the Group served 263 million customers at
December 31, 2015, including 201 million mobile customers and
18 million fixed broadband customers. Orange is also a leading
provider of telecommunication services to multinational companies,

History

Orange, formerly France Telecom, is France’s incumbent
telecommunications operator. The Group has its origins in the Ministry
for Mail, Telegraphs and Telephone, later to become the General
Directorate of Telecommunications, which in 1990 was accorded the
status of independent public entity and, on January 1, 1991, renamed
France Telecom. On December 31, 1996, France Telecom became a
Société Anonyme (limited company) with the French State as its sole
shareholder. In October 1997, France Telecom shares were listed on
the Paris and New York stock exchanges allowing the French
government the disposal of 25% of its shares to the public and Group
employees. Subsequently, the public sector gradually reduced its
holding to 53%. The law of December 31, 2003 authorized the
transfer of the Company to the private sector and between 2004 and
2008 the public sector sold a further 26% of the capital, and then
again 4% in 2014 and 2015. At December 31, 2015, the French State
retained 23,04% of the share capital, held either directly or jointly with
Bpifrance.

Since the 1990s, France Telecom’s area of activity and its regulatory
and competitive environment have undergone significant changes. In
a context of increased deregulation and competition, between 1999
and 2002, the Group pursued a strategy of developing new services
and accelerated its international growth with a number of strategic
investments. These included, in particular, acquiring mobile operator
Orange and the Orange brand, which had been created in 1994, and
taking a stake in Poland's incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja
Polska (renamed Orange Polska in 2013). Most of these investments
could not be financed by share issues and therefore the Group's debt
substantially increased during this period.

At the end of 2002, France Telecom started a large-scale refinancing
plan for its debt to reinforce its balance sheet, as well as an
operational improvements program, the success of which has allowed
the Group to develop a global integrated-operator strategy by
anticipating changes in the telecommunications industry.

under the brand Orange Business Services. In March 2015, the Group
presented its new strategic plan, Essentials2020, which focuses on
its customers’ expectations to ensure that they experience the best
of the digital world and the power of its high speed broadband
networks.

Orange has been listed since 1997 on Euronext Paris (symbol: ORA)
and on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: ORAN).

In 2005, France Telecom acquired 80% of Spanish mobile operator
Amena, whose activities were then regrouped with the Group's fixed-
line and Internet operations in Spain into a single entity under the
Orange brand. In 2008 and 2009, the Group acquired almost all the
remaining capital of Orange Espagne.

In parallel, the Group streamlined its asset portfolio by selling off non-
strategic subsidiaries and holdings.

In 2006, Orange became the single brand of the Group for Internet,
television and mobile services in most countries where the Group
operates, and Orange Business Services the brand for services
offered to businesses throughout the world.

Since 2007, Orange has pursued a selective policy for the
development and management of its activities, mainly focused on
emerging markets (in particular Africa and the Middle East), while
attempting to grasp opportunities for consolidation in markets where
the Group was already present. In 2010 this strategy notably led the
Group to raise its stake in Egyptian operator ECMS (Mobinil) from 36%
to 94% (and to 99% in February 2015). It also resulted in the joint
venture with Deutsche Telekom that combined UK business under the
EE brand on April 1, 2010, as well as in the 2012 disposal of Orange
Suisse.

This policy continued in 2014 with the disposal of Orange Dominicana,
in 2015 with the acquisition of Jazztel in Spain and the consolidation
of Médi Telecom in Morocco and finally in early 2016 with the disposal
of the Group's stake in EE and the signing of agreements to acquire
several operators in Africa.

From July 1, 2013, the Company adopted the corporate name Orange.

At the end of 2015, the Orange group grew its worldwide customer
base by 7.7% year-on-year, adding 18.8 million new customers to
262.9 million, including 201.2 million mobile customers (excluding
MVNOs) (up 8.5%) and 18.1 million broadband customers (up 13.1%).

This increase reflects the continued strength of growth in mobile
services in Africa and the Middle East, where numbers rose 13% to
110.2 million customers at December 31, 2015 (12.7 million new
mobile customers). In Africa, the Orange Money application had
16.4 million customers, compared with 12.6 million in 2014.

In France, mobile contract customers, which accounted for 85% of
the mobile customer base at December 31, 2015 (24 million
customers), increased by almost 10%. In the Europe zone (excluding
the UK), mobile contracts (31.4 million customers at December 31,
2015) also rose (+12.2% year-on-year), in particular in Spain, Poland
and Romania, representing 62.4% of the mobile customer base at
December 31, 2015.

2015 saw the continued development of 4G high-speed mobile
broadband with a total of almost 18 million customers in Europe at
December 31, 2015 (i.e. 2.3 times more than a year earlier), including

8 million in France, 5.1 million in Spain, 2 million in Poland and 1 million
in Belgium. 4G has also been rolled out in Europe in Romania,
Slovakia and Moldova. In Africa and the Middle East, 4G has been
deployed in Botswana, Jordan, Morocco, Mauritius, Cameroon and
Guinea-Bissau.

Fixed-line broadband had 18.1 million customers at December 31,
2015, up 13.1% year-on-year. Fixed-line broadband subscribers
included 1.882 million fiber subscribers at December 31, 2015, of
which 960,000 in France and 809,000 in Spain.

Revenues for the Orange group were 40.236 billion euros in 2015,
almost unchanged on a comparable basis. Excluding the impact of
regulatory measures, they rose 0.3% after falling 1.6% in 2014.

CAPEX was 6.486 billion euros in 2015, up 9.3% compared to the
previous year on a comparable basis, in line with the Essentials2020
plan. Investments in fiber rose sharply (+55% year-on-year on a
comparable basis) and the Group’s investment strategy also targets
an improved customer experience, with in particular the extension of
4G mobile coverage and the modernization of the distribution
network.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world Information and Communication Technologies market

This chapter contains forward-looking statements, particularly in
Section 2.3 Orange's group strategy. These forward-looking
statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in

2.1
Technologies market

2015 was marked by continued global growth in the information and
communication technologies segment (ICT), which includes mainly
the sectors of computing, audiovisual, multimedia, Internet and
telecommunications. After the recovery recorded in 2013, and then
in 2014, growth in ICT revenues continued to accelerate in 2015
to +4.8% (+0.4 percentage points compared to 2014), and totaled
3,913 billion euros.

in Section 2.4 Risk factors. Please also consult the information under
the heading Forward-looking information at the start of this document.

The world Information and Communication

The ICT market remains an essential component of economic growth,
and represents an important source of value creation through the
distribution of new services and new uses. Among these are, in
particular, growth areas developed by Orange: the Cloud, Big Data
and the Internet of Things.

Revenues of telecom services, which amounted to 1,164 billion euros
at the end of 2015, continued to grow by +2.1%, albeit at a slower
rhythm than that of all ICT services (+4.8%)

The ICT market grew in 2015 at different speeds depending on the
geographical area. Growth accelerated in emerging countries, in
particular in Africa and the Middle East. Emerging countries, which
represent 30% of the world market, contributed more than 50% of
global growth (source: Idate).

Europe

In 2015, revenues of European telecom services stabilized (-0.2%)
compared to 2014, after four years of shrinkage from 2010 to 2014
(-1.2% in 2014 and -3.4% in 2013). Europe remains the least dynamic
region in the world in terms of growth, and its weight in the world
market now only represents 24%, behind Asia Pacific and North
America (source: Idate).

Moreover, operators (including cable operators) continue to face
competition from Over the top (OTT) players that generally offer
communication services to users for free (being remunerated by
advertising).

USA

In 2015, the growth in the ICT market was down slightly, from 4.6%
to 4.3%, in a context of stable US GDP growth. The region improved
its performance in the ICT market, despite a downturn in growth in
telecom services, and more noticeably in networking equipment.
Indeed, the United States is coming out of a strong growth phase led
by the renewal of its mobile networks. The rollout of LTE led to
significant investments and an increase in the operators’ revenues
(source: Idate). In 2015, revenues from telecom services reached 298
billion euros, up by 1.8%, representing 26% of the world market.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world Information and Communication Technologies market

Africa and the Middle East

In 2015, the growth of the ICT market remained high at 6.7%, despite
a downturn in economic growth of 2.8% on the continent (compared
with 3.5% in 2014). The potential of this region in which the Orange
group is very present remains strong, both in terms of equipment and
access infrastructure. Telecom services that represent 43% of the ICT
market are up by 5.1%, higher than that of the world market overall,
but slowing down compared to 2014. Revenues of telecom services
totaled 103 billion euros, for a 9% share of the world market, the
weakest compared to the other regions in the world.

South America

In spite of the advanced maturity of services, the opening to market
competition created a strong dynamic of development of equipments
and uses. The growth of the ICT market fell slightly compared to 2014,
but was higher than 5%. Telecom services represent nearly 36% of
the ICT market with sustained growth in 2015 (+3.1%).

Revenues of telecom services reached 112 billion euros, representing
10% of the world market.

Asia Pacific

This region, that includes both advanced economies and emerging
countries, recorded a high growth in the ICT market (+6.6%), valued
at 1,196 billion euros. Economically, the region also posted high GDP
growth, especially in China (+6.8%). Revenues of telecom services
that reached 373 billion euros in 2015, a growth of 2.9%, represent
32% of the world market, the largest share of all regions worldwide.
In this region, telecom services represent almost one third of the
revenues of the ICT, in spite of a 1.5 percentage point slowdown in
2015 compared to 2014.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world Information and Communication Technologies market

Key trends and changes

Convergence of services and market
consolidation

The growth in mobile access with the 4G development and the high
penetration of smartphones and M2M throughout the world
constitutes a major component of the momentum of the
telecommunication sector. Convergence is also a major trend,
particularly in Europe, since it allows operators with both fixed and
mobile network infrastructures to capture and keep their customers
through a household-based approach, faced by the competition from
fixed-line only or mobile only operators. This convergence results in
the development of so-called “quadruplay” offers (voice, Internet,
television, mobile). Convergence is also illustrated by the growing use
of WiFi in mobile networks. On their side, the cable operators also
include WiFi in their offers to counter telecom operators’ quadruplay
offers.

One can simultaneously observe a movement toward consolidation
of players, both in Europe and the USA, linked to this convergence of
networks and services, as well as the necessity of acquiring a larger
size whereas the pressure on prices is stronger and infrastructure
investments are indispensable.

In Europe, a series of mergers between fixed-line and mobile
operators have occurred since 2014, such as the acquisition of the
fixed-line operator Kabel Deutschland by Vodafone in Germany, the
acquisition of SFR and Virgin Mobile in France and Portugal Telecom
in Portugal by Altice, the purchase of Groupo Corporativo by
Vodafone in Spain and the purchase of Base by Telenet in Belgium.
The acquisition of EE by BT in the United Kingdom and Jazztel by
Orange in Spain follows the same logic of alliances between fixed and
mobile activities.

Moreover, since 2013 consolidation transactions have reduced the
number of mobile operators in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and in
the UK from four to three.

Cable has also been at the center of many transactions over the past
few years with Liberty Global, which took control of Virgin Media in
the United Kingdom and Ziggo in the Netherlands, the merger of
Comcast with Time Warner cable and the entry of Altice into the
United States with the acquisition of two cable operators in 2015:
Suddenlink Communications and Cablevision.

Development of networks and growth
of telecommunications uses worldwide

In Africa and the Middle East, Internet access networks are developing
mainly via the deployment of 3G and 4G mobile networks, whereas
in Europe investments in networks are concentrated in high capacity
broadband access, with the development of fixed-line offers on fiber
referred to as FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home) and the deployment of 4G
mobile networks. In parallel, operators are developing their networks
to make them more agile and simpler to manage (with “virtualization”)
and more open (with API).

Uses are exploding under the combined effect of the deployment of
new networks, the increase in the capacities of existing networks and
the growth in the penetration rate of more and more sophisticated
mobile handsets (smartphones). The explosion in uses is mainly driven
by video, and by the increase in the number of screens (computers,
smartphones, tablets, readers, connected TVs, connected watches).

New expectations of consumers
and businesses

For the consumer, digital technologies continue to permeate all areas
of daily life: family, home, wellness, entertainment, work and money.
Indeed, more and more of these areas are being affected by

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

connected objects, such as domotics (home automation), automobile,
health, energy and wellness, and are likely to be integrated in all
industries and services over time. Some forecasts indicate for example
about 25 billion connected objects in 2020 (source: GSMA
Understanding the Internet of Things, July 2014). In this area, the
development of technologies such as LoRa (long range bi-directional
low power network) should have a major impact on the growth of this
market.

For the most part, B2B applications of the Internet of Things are being
developed within companies (for example, for the optimization of
internal logistic processes). The big players of the Internet generate
revenue by monetizing data obtained via connected objects (collected
and analyzed thanks to Big Data techniques). In this context,
consumers have strong expectations on the quality and reliability of
the communication networks, but also on the protection of their
personal data and on having a relationship of trust with their operator.

Digitalization (loT, Big Data) allows companies to improve their
performance by knowing their customers better and by improving the
management of their industrial processes. Therefore they also express
the need to be assisted in this double aspect of their transformation
process.

Evolution of operators’ model and revenues

Connectivity services will continue to make up the largest part of
telecommunications operators’ revenues in the next few years.
Nevertheless, other sources of revenues will reside in the ability to
monetize new services related to changes in their networks and
services platforms, to applications suppliers, residential and business
customers. These are in particular:

= new models of access to IT (Information Technology) platforms
through API (Application Programming Interfaces) that will
strengthen the independence of users to implement personalized
services themselves;

= innovative technologies such as data analysis (Big Data), Internet
of Things (loT) or M2M (Machine to Machine);

= mobile financial services in 3 areas: money transfers, payments and
mobile banking;

= asecure management of data and transactions by operators.

The rise of the collaborative economy

The digital revolution has allowed collaborative models to emerge in
the economic sphere where sharing and using take precedence over
property. These models are based on direct relationships between
individuals who can exchange services thanks to the development of
digital networking platforms (accessible over the Internet, mobile
phones or tablets). This market, representing $15 billion today, will
reach $335 billion by 2025, according to estimates by the auditing
and consulting firm PwC. The biggest players (Airbnb, Uber,
Blablacar, etc.) who focus on the management of these platforms with
minimum investment, reap significant revenue. These models are
extremely disruptive. They enter into direct competition with well-
established companies (hotel industry, transportation, finance,
distribution) that have to bear the costs associated with the production
of goods and services. They also pose challenges to traditional ways
of organizing labor and social security (associated with salaried
employees), and are outside the established framework of corporate
taxation. Whereas traditional players will have to adapt themselves by
integrating consumers and users into their business processes, the
collaborative models will also have to evolve in order to overcome
obstacles to their development.

2.2 Regulations

2.2.1. European Union

The regulatory environment of the electronic communications sector
within the member states of the European Union in which the Orange
Group operates conforms to a requirement of harmonization arising
from the obligation for National Regulatory Authorities to implement
at a national level the regulatory framework defined at the level of the
European Union, even if the regulatory environment is marked by
certain discrepancies.

This common regulatory framework is presented below with a detailed
description for each major country in which the Orange Group
operates"),

2.2.1.1 Legal and regulatory framework

The general EU legal framework for electronic communications
consists of five main directives deriving from the 2002 Telecom

The European Commission is expected to present a new framework
directive in 2016.

On October 9, 2014, the European Commission approved a new
recommendation (2014/7 10/EC) identifying four relevant product and
service markets susceptible to ex ante regulation compared to seven
in its previous recommendation made in 2007:

= M 1: wholesale call termination on individual public telephone
networks provided at a fixed location;

- M2: wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks;
- M3:
a) wholesale local access provided at a fixed location, and

b) wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for mass-
market products;

- M4: wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location.
This regulatory framework has been fleshed out with a number of
additional texts.

Roaming

Regulation No. 531/2012, adopted on June 13, 2012 by the
European Parliament and Council, on roaming on public mobile
communications networks within the Union (Roaming II):

= introduces, for the wholesale market, a regulated right of access to
European roaming services for MVNOs and resellers;

= extends the sliding cap on roaming rates to the retail data market;

introduces, as of July 1, 2014, two structural changes to increase
competition in the retail market by separating domestic services
and international roaming services;

= expands, for customers using their cell phones outside the EU,
pricing transparency requirements and bill shock prevention
measures for European operators.

its main aims was to amend the Roaming I! regulations that would ban surcharging for roaming within the EU by June 2017 (see Section 2.2.1.2).
Call termination rates

On May 7, 2009, the European Commission adopted a recommendation regulating fixed-line and mobile call termination rates in the EU (2009/396/EC).
The Commission recommends that national authorities should apply the following principles:

= symmetry in each country between the various operators’ fixed voice call termination rates and also between their mobile call termination
rates, with the option of allowing a four-year transitional asymmetry on fixed or mobile call termination rates to benefit a new entrant;

= call termination rates geared towards the avoidable cost of this service for an efficient operator (i.e. about 1 euro cent per minute for voice
MTRs and a lower rate for voice FTRs).

Review of the “Telecom Package” framework

The European Commission launched a_ consultation in
September 2015 to review the “Jelecom Package” regulatory
framework. In response, Orange affirms the need to reorient the
objectives of the framework towards economic development and
investment, to limit and to simplify access obligations to fixed-line
networks, to impose spectrum allocation rules that promote economic
efficiency, to modernize consumer protections, to rethink the
instruments allowing access to the Internet for all and to adopt a truly
harmonized regulation in Europe. The European Commission is
expected to present a new framework directive in 2016.

Protecting Personal Data

A general directive (1995/46/EC) encompasses the processing of
personal data in the European Union. This directive must be updated
in early 2016, following an agreement between the European

2.2.2 France

2.2.2.1. Legal and regulatory framework

Legal framework

The electronic communications sector is primarily governed by the
French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE) as well
as legal provisions relating to e-commerce, the information society,
consumer protection and personal data protection.

The French government transposed the European Telecom Package,
as amended in 2009, into national law via the Ministerial Order of
August 24, 2011 and the Decree of March 12, 2012, implementing
regulations.

The audiovisual communication services produced or distributed by
the Orange group come under the specific regulations governing this
sector and are managed by the amended law of September 30, 1986").

Regulatory Authorities

The Postal and Electronic Communications Regulatory Authority
(the Arcep) is an independent administrative body created by the law
of July 26, 1996 and acts as French regulator for these sectors
nationwide. The Arcep’S main missions in electronic communications
are to set regulations (general or specific obligations) for operators
within its jurisdiction. It has powers to sanction non-compliant
operators and can rule on disputes between operators over technical
and pricing conditions for network access and interconnection. The

Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council
concluded on December 15, 2015. The new rules harmonize with one
another within the EU and strengthen the rights on data protection
and the control of existing personal data; they will apply from 2018.
The Privacy and electronic communications directive, specific to the
electronic communications sector (2002/58/EC), will also be updated
in order to remain consistent with the inter-sector directive.

Following the ECJ’s invalidation of Decision 2000/520/EC, known as
“Safe Harbour", the European Commission and the US authorities
published a new framework for transatlantic data exchange on
February 29, 2016. Known as EU-US Privacy Shield, the agreement
is intended to ensure that the personal data of European citizens
enjoys the same protections they do in Europe when they are
processed in the United States.

Arcep also allocates spectrum and numbering resources. Finally, it
determines the size of contributions to fund the universal service
obligation and oversees the mechanisms for delivering this funding.

The French Competition Authority is an independent government
authority responsible for ensuring open market competition and
compliance with public economic policy. It has jurisdiction over all
business segments, including the electronic communications sector.
It has sanction powers for anti-competitive practices, as well as
consultative powers. It also specializes in overseeing mergers and
acquisitions.

The ANFr (Agence nationale des fréquences — French national
agency for frequencies) is responsible for planning, managing and
controlling the usage of radio frequencies and for coordinating the
establishment of certain radio transmission facilities. The frequency
spectrum is covered by 11 controlling authorities: government
ministries, Arcep and the French Broadcasting Authority (CSA). The
Arcep and the CSA are in turn responsible for allotting to users the
frequencies they control.

The CSA is an independent administrative body created by the law
of January 17, 1989, tasked with protecting freedom of audiovisual
communication by means of any electronic communications
technology as regards radio and television in accordance with the Law
of September 30, 1986. In July, 2013 the CSA was partly reformed
and a Commission for the modernization of audiovisual broadcasting
is to be created and given responsibility for the radio spectrum.

On January 8, 2015 the Prime Minister's Order on reallocating the 700 MHz
band to the Arcep (2*30 MHz) for high-capacity mobile uses was
published in the French Official Journal. It allocated the 703-733 MHz
and 758-788 MHz bands to the Arcep, initially jointly with the CSA as
from December 1, 2015 and exclusively from July 1, 2019.

On December 9, 2015, following a spectrum allocation auction, Arcep
granted authorizations to use the spectrum in the 700 MHz band as.
follows: Orange and Free received two blocks of 5 MHz duplex each,
Bouygues and SFR one block of 5 MHz duplex each. In total, the
government will receive €2,799 million, including €933 million from
Orange, for the allocation of this spectrum, between 2015 and 2018.

1,800 MHz

In July 2015, the Arcep authorized Orange and SFR to use the 1,800 MHz
band for 4G from May 25, 2016 after handing back some spectrum.
Orange and SFR keep 20 MHz in the band; Free may request the
allocation of the 10 MHz handed back.

In September 2015, Arcep granted 5 MHz to Free Mobile in the 1,800 MHz
band, as per decision of December 16, 2014: this allocation is part of
the 15 MHz duplex reserved for Free Mobile in the target allocation
plan for the 1,800 MHz band by May 2016. These 5 MHz duplex are
technology neutral.

The call for applications for the allocation of 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1.8
GHz, 2.1 GHz and 2.6 GHz frequencies in the overseas territories (in
Guadeloupe, Guyana, La Réunion, Martinique, Mayotte, Saint-Martin
and Saint-Barthélemy) was launched by the government on
January 29, 2016, in order to provide the operators with the means
necessary to deploy 4G and continue developing their 3G networks.
The allocations distributed by beauty contest procedure are
scheduled for 2016.

Mobile coverage

As part of the Macron Act of August 6, 2015, measures have been
taken to improve mobile telephony coverage, which must cover all
non-covered town centers by the end of 2016. This involves finalizing
the White Zones 2G program and supplementing it with the coverage
of 268 additional town centers, which may be deployed in 3G.
Moreover, the current shared 3G program, “3G RAN Sharing”, should
be finalized by mid-2017. Beyond the town centers, some areas of
economic interest which are not currently covered may be the subject
of a request to the concerned territorial authority for financial aid from
the government at a local bureau, which the government will organize.

These measures have been incorporated in the agreement signed on
February 24, 2016, between the four mobile operators in the presence
of the Ministry of the Economy and Arcep. They are accompanied by
the withdrawal of the public telephony component of the universal
service.

2.2.2.3 Regulation of fixed-line telephony,
broadband and superfast broadband
Internet

Since July 2008, except for retail offers for fixed telephony under
universal service, all of Orange's regulatory obligations concerning
retail fixed-line telephony (access and communication) on the
consumer and business markets have been lifted. Ex ante regulation
of Orange's fixed-line services relates to retail offers under the universal
service and wholesale offers that are regulated to ensure effective
competition in the retail markets (call origination and termination,
wholesale line rental, unbundling, access to ducts and poles,
bitstream and capacity services).

Orange’s obligations regarding cost accounting and
accounting separation in the fixed-line business

The Arcep'S decision No. 06-1007 of December 7, 2006 sets forth
Orange's obligations as to cost accounting and accounting separation
in the wholesale and retail businesses. When retail activities make use
of wholesale network services that are subject to accounting
separation, these resources are recognized in regulatory accounts at
the wholesale offers price. These obligations were first implemented
in 2007 in respect of FY2006 ; they were deemed compliant by the
Arcep and were renewed every year since then with the same
outcome.

and high-speed fixed broadband, fixed-line telephony
and fixed-line voice call termination (4" round)

Analysis of the fixed broadband and high-speed fixed
broadband markets mid-2014 to mid-2017

On June 26, 2014, the Arcep issued three analysis decisions on the
fixed broadband and high-speed fixed broadband markets for mid-
2014 to mid-2017:

= decision No. 2014-0733 concerning analysis of the relevant
wholesale market for access to the physical network infrastructure

wholesale market within France for broadband and high-capacity
broadband (market 5);

Business environment, strategy and risk factors

= decision No. 2014-0735 concerning analysis of the relevant
wholesale market for capacity services (market 6).

The scopes for these three decisions were defined to comply with
changes made by the European Commission recommendation of
October 9, 2014 on the relevant markets subject to ex ante regulation,
in order to make a distinction between wholesale “generalist” offers
aimed at the consumer and wholesale offers targeting business
needs. In this enterprise segment, Arcep decision No. 2014-0735 lift
the pricing obligations on Orange (copper and fiber) in some
competitive geographical areas from January 1, 2015.

Analysis of relevant fixed-line telephony markets in 2014-
2017

On September 30, 2014 the Arcep issued decision No. 2014-1102
on analysis of the relevant markets for fixed-line telephony in 2014-
2017. It prolonged the obligation imposed on Orange to provide
wholesale line rental (WLR) at cost-based prices. The decision
introduced a gradual relaxation of the pricing obligations imposed on
Orange for straight carrier selection offers. Finally, the decision lifts the
asymmetrical regulation imposed on Orange in the call origination
market for calls to value-added service (VAS) numbers, instead relying
exclusively on the symmetrical framework established by Arcep
decision No. 2007-0213.

Analysis of the wholesale markets for fixed-line voice call

Regulation of fiber optic networks

Regulatory framework governing very high-capacity
broadband wholesale offers:

asymmetric regulation of access to civil engineering infrastructure
which allows alternative operators to deploy their horizontal
networks on Orange's infrastructure: non-discriminatory access at
arate that reflects costs;

principle that the terminating segment of FTTH networks are
mutualized between operators;

symmetrical regulation of access to the terminating segment of
FTTH networks including outside high-density areas: same
obligations to offer passive access to the terminating segment of
FTTH networks on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms apply
to all operators cabling buildings anywhere in France. This access
must be made available from a sharing point in a reasonable
location (Arcep decision No. 2009-1106 of December 22, 2009,
see also decision no. 2010-1312 of December 14, 2010). Charges
must be reasonable and compatible with the principles of efficiency,
relevance, objectivity and non discrimination.

National Digital Agency

On February 4, 2015, the decree creating a service with national
authority was published in the French Official Journal: the National
Digital Agency, which takes over three responsibilities: steering and
implementation of the “France Superfast Broadband Program”,

Significant events in 2015 and the start of 2016

coordinating and leading the various initiatives of French Tech,
overseeing the dissemination of digital tools and the development of
their use. It has to coordinate with several other institutions, including
the Caisse des dépéts, BP! France, the National Digital Council, the
Arcep and other state services involved in digital development.

The France Superfast Broadband Program aims to have 100% of the
French population eligible for very high capacity broadband by 2022,
with an interim target of covering half the population and companies
by 2017. FTTH is seen as the main way of achieving this, although
other technologies are also expected to contribute (higher speed on
copper as a transitional solution, satellite, LTE). A total 20 billion euros
of private and public investment is estimated to be needed to meet
the 2022 target. This breaks down into three parts:

= one third of investment by private operators who expect to use their
own capital to deliver FTTH to 57% of French homes by 2022;

= the remaining 43% of homes will be covered by the other two-thirds
of investment, to be financed through networks managed by local
public authorities (RIP):

— for more than half of these homes, it has been decided to provide
FTTH coverage financed partly by public subsidy with the rest
provided by private operators,

— the remainder relates to coverage of the more rural zones by
complementary solutions (higher speed on copper, satellite, etc.)
jointly financed by the state and local authorities.

Rollout of fiber optic networks and switch off
of the copper network

The Macron Act of August 6, 2015, establishes new provisions
concerning FTTH, including the establishment of an ex ante rate
regulation mechanism for FTTH offers for network managed by public
local authorities (RIP). In this context, Arcep is responsible for
specifying the rate conditions that the network managed by public
local authorities (RIP) must meet in order to comply with the EC
guidelines regarding state aids to NGAs and with Arcep regulations
regarding FTTH. In its decision dated December 7, 2015, Arcep
recommends that the rates practiced in the network managed by
public local authorities (RIP) be close to those in the privately
organized area, taking as reference for the co-financing the rates equal
to those charged by Orange in the AMII'” area and lower for per line
rental. Moreover, Arcep reiterates the need for rate consistency
between the different offers, and in particular that bitstream rates must
be higher than passive leasing. Finally, Arcep proposes to allow a
transitional arrangement during the introductory period of the network

(1) Zone subject to calls for investment from the private sector.

managed by public local authorities (RIP) with discounted rates during
the network's first years.

On August 7, 2015, Arcep adopted its decision on the technical and
operational processes for sharing high-capacity fiber optic broadband
infrastructure. The main purpose of this decision is to harmonize the
practices of the different operators outside high-density areas. The
operators are obliged to roll out the network in the immediate vicinity
of all houses located in an area behind a sharing point within five years
after its launch. The obligation of completeness of the fiber optic
rollouts outside of high-density areas was clarified in December 2015
by a recommendation that tends to alleviate this constraint in the case
of an isolated housing area, while precisely defining the technical and
economic conditions.

Moreover, the French Competition Authority noted, on July 30, 2015,
the lifting of the clause prohibiting Orange from deploying its FTTH
network in 208 towns in the AMIl area making up part of the area
granted to Numericable SFR (i.e. about 900 k lines).


--- Page 18 ---

In parallel, a report (the Champsaur report) aiming to clarify the
conditions and the schedule of the copper network closure was.
delivered to the government on February 19, 2015. This report rules
out a closure of the copper network imposed by the public authorities,
because only Orange is responsible for making such a decision. It
notably includes the creation of “fibered zones” which the government
would designate under certain conditions (whole zone served by FTTH
networks, network engineering compliant with regulations, etc.)
triggering measures to incentivize customers to migrate from copper
to fiber.

Reform of value-added services pricing

In March 2014, the Arcep published a recommendation on the
wholesale VAS interconnection market with a particular focus on the
relationship between originating and recipient operators, as part of
the implementation of the VAS pricing reform (decision No. 2012-
0856).

On June 10, 2014, Arcep issued decision No. 2014-0661, postponing
the entry into force of VAS market reform until October 1, 2015 (initially
scheduled for January 1, 2015). This was to allow VAS publishers and
recipient operators adequate visibility to conduct their commercial
negotiations.

The VAS reform redefines pricing methods applied to calls to short
and special numbers (beginning with 08) which allow users to access
weather forecasts and distance sales services, for instance, as well
as government services. The reform (i) creates a uniform pricing model
for the retail services market irrespective of whether the originating
call is from fixed-line or mobile network, known as “C+S" for its two
components: the price of the call (C) equal to the price of the local
call and service (S) defined by the provider and (ii) makes calls which
are currently free when calling from a fixed line also free when calling
from a mobile number.

2.2.3.1 Legal and regulatory system

Legal framework

The 2002 European Telecom Package was transposed into Spanish
law by the general Telecommunications Act (law No. 32/2003 of
November 3, 2003), Royal Decree No. 2296/2004 of December 10,
2004 on the electronic communications markets, network access and
numbering, and Royal Decree No. 424/2005 of April 15, 2005 on the
supply of electronic communications services, universal service
obligations and user rights.

The 2009 Telecom Package was transposed into Spanish law by
Royal Decree No. 726/2011 on universal service provision in May
2011 and Royal Decree No. 13/2012 of March 31, 2012.

The telecommunications sector is also covered by law No. 15/2007
of July 3, 2007 relating to the implementation of competition rules.

Law No. 34/2002 of July 11, 2002 relating to the information society
and electronic commerce specifies the obligations and limits of
responsibility applicable to service providers in the information society.

The regulatory framework applicable to data protection in Spain is
based around law No. 15/1999 of December 13, 1999, relating to

the routing of its mobile traffic from antennas connected by fiber
optics, despite the fact that we offer a commercial package to this
effect. Arcep issued its decision on July 30, 2015, in which it imposed
on Orange a cost-oriented hosting service for the equipment that
permits the routing of mobile traffic, and to allow the routing of the
traffic stemming from mobile sites connected by fiber optics on the
LFO without extra charge. Orange has appealed this decision based
on the second point before the Paris Court of Appeal.

Wholesale rates on fixed-line access 2016/2017

Wholesale rates on fixed-line access 2016/2017: by its decision No.
2016-0206, dated February 16, 2016, on the price framework for
copper local loop access for 2016 and 2017, Arcep proposes to
increase the full unbundling contract from €9.05 per month to €9.10
per month in 2016, and then to €9.45 per month in 2017, to lower
the service access fee from €56 to €50 and the termination fee from
€20 to €15 and to lower the price of the SAV+ service (increasing the
reliability of a line performing worse than the theoretical values) from
€135 to €105.

By its decision No. 2016-0208, dated February 16, 2016, on the price
framework of wholesale access to fixed-line telephony services and
the associated call origination, for 2016 and 2017, it proposes to
stabilize the prices of wholesale line rental and an annual increase of
10% of the call origination.

In addition, by its decision No. 2016-0207 dated February 16, 2016,
on the price framework of the offer for generalist activated access to
DSL delivered within France by Orange, for the years 2016 and 2017,
Arcep proposes to maintain the current prices for collecting and
accessing non-naked bitstream and a slight increase in access prices
for naked bitstream.

Arcep strategic review

On January 19, 2016, the Arcep published the conclusions of its
strategic review, in which it makes public its new regulatory priorities:
promoting investment in infrastructures and innovation, ensuring
connectivity in all geographies and preserving an open Internet.

personal data protection and order No. 999/1999 relating to security
measures. In the field of intellectual property rights protection, law No.
23/2006 of July 7, 2006 amends law No. 1/1996 of April 12, 1996
and transposes European directive 2001/29/EC relating to the
harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the
information society.

Regulatory Authorities

Since October 2013, the regulators for all the various sectors of the
economy, including telecommunications, have been brought together
under a new cross-industry entity, the National Commission for
Markets and Competition (Comisién Nacional de los Mercados y la
Competencia), set up by law No. 3/2013 of June 4, 2013, which also
has responsibility for competition issues.

As a result the telecom industry is overseen by both the new multi-
industry regulator and Setsi as follows:

- Setsi handles authorizations, spectrum allocations, telephone
numbering, universal service cost approvals, quality of service, and
disputes between consumers and non-dominant operators;

= the CNMC conducts market analysis and handles disputes
involving operators with significant market power.

Mobile voice call termination rates

Following a consultation on the wholesale mobile call termination market (market 7), the CMT issued a decision on May 10, 2012 proposing a
gradual decrease of mobile call termination caps, reaching rate symmetry in July 2013. The adopted caps are as follows:

04/16/2012- 10/16/2012- 03/01/2013- From July

Yoigo 4.07 3.36 2.86 1.09
Spectrum

In May 2011, the Spanish authorities allocated a 5 MHz duplex block in the 900 MHz spectrum to Orange Espagne. The license, granted under

the principle of technological neutrality, is valid until December 2030.

In July 2011, the Spanish authorities auctioned the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 2.6 GHz frequency bands. The 800 MHz licenses, awarded in
2011, only become available from 2015. The same is true for the 900 MHz block allotted to Telefonica.

In July 2013, Orange Espagne ’s license for the 900 MHz band was extended from 2025 to 2030 and its 1,800 MHz license from 2023 to 2030.

Following these allocations, the Spanish spectrum is distributed as follows (national licenses):

800 MHz 900 MHz 1,800 MHz 2.1 GHz 2.6 GHz
FDD TDD FDD TDD
Orange 2°10 MHz 2°10 MHz 2°20 MHz 2°15 MHz 5 MHz 2°20 MHz 10 MHz

These licenses, awarded following the 2011 auction process to three
operators, Telefonica Moviles, Vodafone and Orange, came into force
in March 2015.

Spectrum cap per operator

The total spectrum cap is currently set by the CNMC to 185 MHz per
operator. In the context of the future regional auctions in the 2.6 GHz
band and the auctions in the 3.5 GHz band, which should be held at
the end of the first quarter of 2016, the CNMC proposes to increase

of April 22, 2015, on (1) an offer to access exclusive content under
economic conditions of replicability, including for offers coupled with
Internet access, as well as on (2) the provision of a wholesale access
offer to Telefonica’s Internet network at data rates sufficient to offer
competitive IPTV services. Telefonica took on these commitments for
a period of five years, renewable for 3 additional years.

Orange’s bid for Jazztel

The European Commission approved Orange's proposed acquisition
of Jazztel PLC on May 19, 2015, under the EU Merger Regulation.
This authorization is subject to Orange's complete implementation of
anumber of commitments that will ensure effective competition in the
markets for access to fixed-line Internet services after the acquisition.

In order to remedy the problems identified by the Commission,
Orange presented the following commitments:

for fiber optics: Orange has committed to sell an independent Fiber
To The Home (FTTH) network which covers between 700,000 and
800,000 housing units, which approximates the size of the current
Orange FTTH network in Spain. This high speed broadband
network serves 13 municipalities in five of the largest cities in Spain:
Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville and Malaga;

for copper: Orange has committed to granting to the purchaser of
the FTTH network a wholesale access to Jazztel’s national ADSL
network for period of up to 8 years. The commitment is valid for an
unlimited number of subscribers and will allow the purchaser to
position itself immediately as a competitor in 78% of Spain territory.

The buyer of the fiber optic network by the MVNO MasMovil, was.
approved by the European Commission on October 16, 2015.

Wholesale broadband markets: Third round

The CNMC has adopted its third cycle of the analysis of the markets
3a and 3b/2014 and 4/2014 on February 25, 2016. It has decided:

for market 3a:

= to retain the copper network unbundling obligations introduced in
the previous 2009 market analysis and to retain access to
Telefonica civil engineering infrastructure;

= to not impose ex ante asymmetrical obligations on Telefonica for
the fiber network, in 66 cities considered effectively competitive,
representing 35% of the Spanish population, given that a virtual
unbundled local access (VULA) offer must be made available for
the rest of Spain;

for market 3b:

= to remove progressively the obligations for ex ante regulation of
copper networks in parts of Spain declared to be competitive, and
covering 58% of currently installed broadband lines; and, in the rest
of Spain determined to be non competitive, to retain Telefonica’s
network access obligations, with a NEBA-copper offer with no
bandwidth cap and charged on a cost-based basis;

= and to retain the ex ante obligations with a bitstream offer on the
fiber network for part of Spain declared non competitive, this
obligation being temporary for the part declared competitive.

And for market 4:

= to retain, throughout Spain, Telefonica's NEBA-business offer
obligation, charged on a cost-based basis for copper, meeting the
economic replicability test for fiber.

Decommissioning of the copper network

The CNMC approved Telefénica’s first requests to decommission two
distribution frames in its copper network in October 2014. The
distribution frames in question are small exchanges with no
unbundling or equipment collocation. Under the terms of the
regulator's decision on the analysis of the wholesale network
infrastructure, market 4/2007, issued in 2009 and supplemented by
the CNMC's decision of October 2014, Telefonica is obliged to
continue offering the option of unbundling for five years after filing a
request to decommission an exchange with the CNMC. This period
falls to just one year if there are no unbundled operators. The first
copper distribution frames were closed end-November 2015.

Legal framework

Orange Polska’s businesses are governed by the law of July 16, 2004
on telecommunications, transposing the 2002 European Telecom
Package concerning electronic communications into Polish law, and
by the law of February 16, 2007 concerning competition and
consumer protection. The law of December 2012, transposing EU
directives issued in 2009, came into force on January 21, 2013.

The law of May 7, 2010, on developing telecommunication networks.
and services, provides access to telecommunications and other
technical infrastructures funded by public funds.

As regards e-commerce, the law of July 18, 2002 that governs
provision of electronic services transposes European Directive
2000/31/EC concerning electronic commerce and defines electronic
service supplier obligations.

The applicable framework concerning personal data protection is
defined by the law of August 29, 1997 concerning personal data
protection, as amended in 2002. The 2004 Telecommunications Act
also defines certain rules applicable to personal data protection and
storage").

Regulatory Authorities

The Ministry of Digitization, created in November 2015, is responsible
for telecommunications.

The Office of Electronic Communications (UKE) is responsible, in
particular, for telecommunications regulation and frequency
management, as well as certain functions related to broadcasting
services.

Spectrum

The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (Uokik) is
responsible for the application of competition law, merger control and
consumer protection.

Digital Poland

The government's action plan to meet the targets of its digital strategy
in Poland was passed in January 2014. The plan is budgeted at
2,665 million euros and aims to ensure that all households have at
least 30 Mbps Internet access by 2020. Nearly half the funds are
earmarked for broadband network construction projects. The Polish
government will contribute 409.4 million euros.

2.2.4.2 Regulation of mobile telephony

Mobile call termination rates

The UKE published seven decisions on December 14, 2012, ruling
that Orange Polska, T-Mobile, Polkomtel, P4, CenterNet, Mobyland
and Aero2 each had a dominant position in the mobile call termination
market for the mobile numbers open to interconnection on their
network (market analysis -3rd round). It also set symmetrical mobile
voice call termination rates for all operators from January 1, 2013, and
termination rates based on pure long run incremental costs as from
July 1, 2013.

Date from July 1,

2013 (pure LRIC)
zlotys/min 0.0429
Euro cents/min 1.00

Exchange rate as at 12/31/2015: 1 PLN = 0.234 euros

In 2011, the UKE issued three decisions that introduce technological neutrality in the 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, and 2,100 MHz frequency bands.

In July 2013, the UKE published a consultation on whether to assign 700 MHz spectrum to electronic communications. No decision on this

has yet been announced.

for a total of PLN 3,168 million.

The licenses in the 800 MHz band include coverage obligations in the

population in 4 years.

2.2.4.3 Regulation of fixed-line telephony,
broadband and superfast broadband
Internet

All of Orange Polska’s regulatory obligations concerning retail fixed-
line telephony (access and communication) on the consumer and
business markets have been lifted. Ex ante regulation of Orange
Polska's fixed-line services, for the areas defined as non-competitive,
relates to wholesale offers that are regulated to ensure effective
competition in the retail markets (call origination and termination,
wholesale line rental, unbundling, bitstream).

Orange Polska’s obligations regarding cost accounting
and accounting separation in the fixed-line business

The UKE decision DHRT-WORK-6090-1/14(66) of 4/10/2015
describes the obligations imposed on Polska regarding cost-
accounting and accounting separation in wholesale and retail
business. When retail activities make use of wholesale network
services that are subject to accounting separation, these resources
are recognized in regulatory accounts at the wholesale offers price.

Analysis of the wholesale broadband access market
(market 5/2007)

On October 7, 2014, the UKE adopted its decision on the market for
wholesale broadband access (market analysis -3rd round). The
decision excludes 76 Polish towns, covering 24% of the population,
from ex ante regulation and excuses Orange Polska from all regulatory
obligations in respect of these towns. In these deregulated areas,
Orange Polska offers its wholesale services on a commercial basis.
Everywhere else, the obligations imposed on Orange Polska are
maintained (on access, non discrimination, transparency, accounting
separation and cost orientation).

Analysis of the wholesale broadband access market
(market 4/2007)

In its June 2, 2014 decisions on market 4, as part of the second round
of market analysis, regarding copper and fiber the UKE retained the
obligations on Orange Polska (on access, non discrimination,
transparency, accounting separation and cost orientation).

Reference offer for fixed-line markets

This reference offer applies to all wholesale fixed-line services: call
origination and termination, Wholesale Line Rental, partial and full
unbundling and bitstream access.

On July 3, 2014 the UKE authorized a new version of the integrated
reference offer, where the monthly price of full unbundling is left at 22
zlotys.

Fixed-line call termination rates

Since the UKE's decision of September 22, 2009, following its second
round of market analysis, call termination rates must be based on
cost, with no further details given. The UKE reserves the right,
however, to control rates by benchmarking or a retail minus formula
and has indicated it intends to move towards symmetry in 2014. The
UKE thus systematically imposes a call termination rate of PLN 0.0273
(0.64 euro cents) on alternative operators, corresponding to Orange
Polska’s call termination rate at local level.

For an efficient generic operator on a New Generation Network (NGN),
the European Commission recommendation of May 7, 2009 requires
National Regulatory Authorities to set the fixed-line call termination
rates based on long-run incremental costs only. The UKE is preparing
a draft decision applying this recommendation.

Universal Service
Expiry of Orange Polska’s universal service obligation:

In 2006, the UKE imposed universal service obligations on Orange
Polska until May 9, 2011. Since then, the UKE has taken no further
steps to appoint a new universal service provider. On May 5, 2014,
the UKE published a report that removed universal service obligations
in Poland.

Compensation for universal service obligation

For the whole period when it was responsible for universal service
(November 2006 to May 2011), Orange Polska estimated its cost
amounted to 1.1 billion zlotys while only 137 million zlotys were
allotted in compensation by the UKE. Orange Polska has therefore
appealed to have the UKE decisions reexamined.

In March 2014, the UKE designated which operators would bear the
cost of providing a universal service in 2006. Other decisions should
follow for the years 2007-2011.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Orange’s group strategy

2.3 Orange's group strategy

In 2015 Orange launched its new strategic plan Essentials2020,
focused on Orange's ambition by 2020 to “provide its customers with
an incomparable service experience” by being ever-present to
“connect every individual to what is essential to them”. This involves,
providing exemplary basic services, quality and reliable access,
customer connections at any time to any place, as well as even more
personalized options for services and solutions.

Orange serves every kind of customer: those who focus above all else
on price and those who have a particularly high-level of service
expectation, as well as business customers of every type, from
SOHOs to multinationals. The Group can rely on a series of key
strengths for the mission that it has set out. With its brand and its
156,000 employees, the Group is present in Europe, Africa and the
Middle East for the residential market, and everywhere in the world
for the business market. Orange's ambition breaks down into five main
drivers:

offering richer connectivity;

reinventing the customer relationship;

building a people-oriented and digital employer model;
accompanying the transformation of business customers;
diversifying by capitalizing on its assets.

ORONS

Moreover, the strategic plan will be achieved within the framework of
a company that is efficient, responsible and digitally proficient.

a digital, efficient and responsible company

1. Offering richer connectivity

The multiplication of screens, the generalization of video on the
Internet and customers’ growing need for online services and content
has led to an explosion in uses and in mobile data traffic. Moreover,
the digital revolution has created new customer expectations and has
changed their behavior, making connectivity even more important.
Offering an efficient network to all customers is no longer enough;
services must now be tailored to each individual consumer.

Orange would like to offer greater connectivity to all its customers,
whether retail or business. In order to realize this ambition, the Group
will make a series of targeted investments in its networks between
2015 and 2018, for more than 15 billion euros. Clear priority is given
to investments in high speed broadband, in order to respond to the
explosion in traffic and meet customer expectations. These will allow
Orange to develop broadband services, whether fixed or mobile, as
well as convergence packages in Europe. Orange aims to triple
average data speeds (compared to 2014) in both fixed and mobile
networks by the end of 2018.

The investments will be made in particular in the following fields:

Development of high-speed fixed broadband

High-speed fixed broadband will be developed in Europe through an
ambitious fiber optics (FTTH) deployment project. Orange is working
pragmatically and appropriately according to the particular resources
and situations in each country: acquisition (Spain), rollout of a fiber
optic network (France, Poland), use of cable when already present
(Belgium). Orange's objective in France is to catch up and quickly
surpass the geographic reach of cable, in order to be able to offer
high-speed broadband services to the mass market. FFTH is a source
of value creation for the Group, through the recovery of market share,
customers loyalty and the improvement of the average revenue per
user (ARPU). This approach also allows Orange to better serve
business customers throughout Europe.

The number of homes in France, Spain, Poland and Slovakia able to
connect more than doubled and the number of customers tripled in
one year. In France, the number of connectable homes reached
5.1 million at the end of 2015, with an objective of connecting
12 million homes in 2018. In Spain, the Group considerably expanded
its fiber network in 2015 (6.8 million connectable homes) thanks to
the acquisition of Jazztel, thus leading to the creation of the second
largest fixed broadband operator in the country. Orange's objective in
Spain is to reach 14 million connectable households by the end of
2020. This extension will also help strengthen the fixed-mobile
convergence strategy in this country, with the aim of doubling
convergent revenues by 2018. In Poland, Orange Polska launched
the deployment of its FTTH network in 2015, connecting more than
700,000 households by the end of the year, with the objective of
connecting 3.4 million homes by 2018. In Belgium, Mobistar will
launch its first convergent and high-speed cable television offers in
2016.

Development of high-speed mobile broadband

The Group aims to develop high-speed mobile broadband in all of the
geographic areas where it operates. In Europe, the number of Orange
4G customers reached 18 million (in the fourth quarter of 2015),
thereby doubling in one year. This growth is based on the extension
of broadband coverage, with the goal of covering more than 95% of
Europe with 4G by 2018, to respond to customer concerns about the
quality of the network, both when traveling and within buildings, relying
on the frequency portfolio quality. Orange therefore obtained in 2015
new 4G frequencies in France and in Poland. Moreover, the
deployment of 4G+, with data rates twice as fast as 4G, has begun
in France. In Africa and in the Middle East, the total number of Orange
mobile customers increased by 13% in 2015, reaching 110 million
customers at the end of the year. The Group continues to invest
significantly in territorial coverage, with a particular emphasis on the
continued deployment of broadband networks. Orange also obtained
new frequencies in Cameroon and in Ivory Coast in 2015.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Orange’s group strategy

Continuation of network modernization

In anticipation of the future needs of its customers, the Group is
transforming the design of its networks to make them more agile and
automatically adaptable. Orange is thus continuing to drive the
transition of its networks towards all-IP, the Cloud and the virtualization
of networking functions, with the goal of being able to make them
programmable in real time and dynamically, based on the evolution of
traffic and needs. The Group is also preparing for the introduction of
5G, adapted to the new uses of mobile Internet and the Internet of
Things. These changes will also allow the Group to reduce the cost
structure of its networks, as well as their CO, emissions. For more
information, see Section 3.2.1 Network.

An enriched content experience

The quality of the Group's networks, particularly in high-speed
broadband, allows it to support the development of uses and respond
to customer demands by offering a multi-screen experience. The
development of uses is also based on access to quality content. In
this area, the Group's content strategy consists in strengthening its
role as a distributor by focusing on content aggregation: choosing,
highlighting, packaging and offering attractive content meeting
customer expectations in a simple and fluid manner. For more
information, see Section 3.1.8.2 Shared Services — Content.

2. Reinventing the customer relationship

The relationship with the customer is a key success factor, thanks to
the direct link with the end-customer, especially when facing
competition from OTT platforms. The Group aims therefore to have
an impeccable relationship with its customers, thanks in particular to:

= the power of the Orange brand;

= the simplification of customer journey by limiting the number of
steps and intermediaries;

= the improvement of the customer experience.

Brand identity

Orange has a strong brand and decided, as part of the Essentials2020
strategic plan, to transform its visual identity to better reflect its desire
to be more attentive to its customers. This change is already in place
at Orange Business Services, as well as in seven countries in which
the Group operates (France, Spain, Poland, Romania, Luxembourg,
Moldova and Jordan). In addition, the adoption of the Orange brand
will be effective in two new countries starting in 2016 (Belgium and
Egypt). For more information, see Section 3.4.2 The Orange Brand.

Unified customer journey

With the rise of the Internet and smartphones, mobile phone has
become the entry point for sales and services, leading the Group to
optimize the interconnection of its physical sales areas and reconsider
their role. Customers desire more autonomy, speed and constant
connection through their smartphones, which are becoming the main
contact point through the customer area Orange et Moi. Physical
stores can then concentrate on more sophisticated tasks such as
advising customers on more complex operations. The previous logic
of proximity, valid for physical stores, gives way to a logic of excellence
of service, provided in larger and more welcoming stores that are
organized by theme: home, family, work, wellness, entertainment.
Smart Stores are thus integrated into a unified physical-digital
approach. 2015 saw the opening of the first 21 Smart Stores in
Romania, France, Poland, Moldova, Jordan and Tunisia.

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

Improvement of the customer experience

Customer Experience Management (CEM) tools allow services to be
better targeted based on customer uses. The purpose of these tools
is to reconstruct the history of a customer's relationship with Orange,
regardless of their contact points, in order to better know the
customer and propose customized solutions that correspond to his
needs and expectations. Orange deployed CEM tools in France and
Spain in 2015, as well as in Africa (Mali, Egypt, Cameroon). At the
start of 2016, rollouts were underway in Slovakia and Poland, and five
other countries should join them soon (Jordan, Tunisia, Nigeria, lvory
Coast, Senegal).

3. Building a people-oriented
and digital employer model

Orange wants to be a company to which all employees, men and
women, are proud to belong. Convinced that a positive customer
experience is founded on a quality employee experience, the Group
aims to have 90% of its employees recommend Orange as an
employer at the end of Essentials2020 strategic plan. In order to
measure employee satisfaction, a pledge of economic performance,
Orange has introduced an employee satisfaction plan with a bi-annual
survey in France and annually outside of France.

A recognized policy of developing human
resources

Orange's ambition to build a people-oriented and digital employer
model has already materialized, thanks to the Top Employer
certification it received in 17 countries from the Top Employers
Institute. This certification awards actions implemented in each of
these countries in the areas of professional growth, training and skills
development. After receiving the Top Employer Europe certification in
March 2015, the Group was also named Top Employer Africa in early
2016.

Orange’s employees, first ambassadors
of the company

The tools and services developed by Orange allows employees to
broaden their expertise and become the company's most important
ambassadors to customers. 2015 saw the European launch of 4G for
All, to provide all employees with a smartphone and a professional 4G
contract.

Development of collective agility

The use of digital tools by Orange employees will help develop skills
and cross-fertilization between business activities, encourage
engagement within the Group and contribute to the quality of the work
environment. 2015 was marked by the launch of a new social network
inside the group called Plazza, destined to facilitate exchanges and
collaborative work between Orange employees in 17 countries.

Fostering individual commitment

The granting of 5% of Orange's share capital to employees helps
encourage their commitment and participation in the company’s life.
Orange aims to continue developing this form of employee
shareholding, and a stock option plan for employees, Orange
Ambition 2016, was approved by the Board of Directors on the
October 21, 2015 for 11.5 million shares.

4. Accompanying the transformation
of business customers

The digital transformation opportunities, efficiency and growth, are
profoundly transforming the activities, organization, tools (customer
and employee relations) and the processes of businesses. In this
context, Orange is positioned as a trusted partner to support
companies in their digital transformation. To this end, the Group is
attentive to the needs and specifics of each of its customers’
industries, business lines, processes and security constraints, from
SMEs to multinationals. As part of its Essentials2020 plan, Orange's
Objective is to increase the share of IT services in the Orange Business
Services revenue mix by 10 percentage points by 2020.

The Group will focus on four key areas, in addition to its traditional
role as a supplier of connectivity:

providing digital solutions to allow work tools to become more
mobile, more connected and more collaborative. Orange intends
to become a leader in the integration of mobile solutions into work
stations;

improving business line processes, particularly through applications
and connected objects, which provide companies with new
possibilities;

supplying multinationals with private and hybrid Cloud solutions, an
area in which Orange wants to be the leader in France. Cloud
services are an essential tool to bring agility and flexibility to
companies (virtualization, systems integration, business
applications, API, building blocks for connected objects, Big Data
and analytics);

security solutions for the protection of all areas of companies vital
activities, an increasingly important point today: infrastructures, the
company’s strategic data and interactions with its customers
(website, order taking and customer management tools).

2015 saw the development of the IT and integration services. For
more information, see Section 3.1.8 Enterprise.

5. Diversifying by capitalizing
on its assets

Orange focuses on two areas where it can capitalize on its assets and
gain legitimacy in its customers’ eyes in order to develop new sources
of growth: connected objects and mobile financial services. The
Group has set the goal to surpass one billion euros in revenues in
these two new business lines by 2018.

Connected objects and mobile financial services have fundamentally
transformed customers daily life, and Orange believes it can provide
a real value-added service to customers in these areas. These
services require richer connectivity and offer numerous synergies with
the Group's main assets: customer relationships, digital expertise,
both physical and digital distribution power, capacity for innovation,
brand strength (building confidence and trust with clients), networks
and international presence.

Connected objects

The Group wants to be present across the entire value chain of
connected objects:

= the distribution of connected objects;

= the supply of value-added services around those objects, particularly
in the health and wellness field or in the connected home field;

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Orange’s group strategy

= and the management of data from these connected objects, in
particular using Datavenue, its open intermediation platform.

2015 was marked by two Group initiatives in this area:

= Orange acquired a stake in Actility, a French start-up, pioneer in the
Internet of Things, which provides operators with platforms for
the use of narrowband networks for the deployment and
interconnection of connected objects. For Orange, this means
exploring and preparing solutions for the management of
connected objects and data using innovative technological models;

= the Group announced the progressive rollout of a network for the
Internet of objects using the LoRa (long-range) technology
throughout France. Orange is thus contributing to the creation of
an interconnected ecosystem based on LoRa and narrowband
technology for the Internet of managed objects.

Mobile financial services

Mobile customers want to make more and more payments on the go,
in a simple and fluid manner using their smartphones. In 2015, Orange
continued its development in several areas:

= financial services with the development of Orange Money in Africa
and Orange Finanse in Poland;

= mobile payment using contactless payment through NFC
technology in Europe and the contactless payment application
Orange Cash, launched in Spain and further developed in France;

= in the mobile banking area, which offers significant growth
prospects, and where the Group concentrated its efforts in 2015.
In order to launch an expanded mobile banking service in its largest
European markets, the Group entered into exclusive negociations
with Groupama in January 2016 to accelerate the development of
an innovative and 100% -mobile Orange Banque solution starting
in early 2017 in both France and Spain. This partnership aims to
create a new banking model that will allow Orange to complete its
diversification into banking services and Groupama to strengthen
its online banking activities.

The growth perspectives for mobile financial services are significant,
not only in Europe but also in Africa, where the mobile penetration
rate is much higher than the percentage of people with bank accounts
in most of the countries. Orange’s customer base on the continent is
now more than 100 million users, to whom it can propose these new
services, which in turn foster customer loyalty. In Africa and in the
Middle East, Orange aims to reach 30 million users with its money
transfer and payment services by 2018. In 2015, the number of
Orange Money customers grew by 31% year on year (on a
comparable basis), for a total of more than 16.4 million users.

A digital, efficient
and responsible company

The Group wants to meet its objectives in respect of CSR performance
by being an ethical company, respectful of the ecosystem and the
environment in which it operates.

Open innovation

To support these new services, Orange continues to innovate,
leveraging its own resources and by following an Open Innovation
approach. The Group’s ambition is to have supported 500 start-ups
worldwide by 2020 through the Group's Open Innovation programs.
For more information, see Section 3.3.1 Research and Innovation.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Orange’s group strategy

Corporate responsibility

In order to respond to the social and environmental challenges related
to the ever-greater number of devices (smartphones, tablets,
connected objects), as well as to the multiplication of energy
consuming uses by consumers, Orange has committed itself to two.
ambitious objectives: 50% reduction in its CO, emissions per customer
use by 2020 (compared to 2006), and to promote the integration of
the circular economy principles within its organization and its processes.

Ambitions

Orange's strategy, in terms of its core activities and new business
areas, aims to generate new growth while maintaining a healthy
financial position. Concerning operations, the Group will track several
major indicators to assess the implementation of the Essentials2020
plan presented in March 2015:

The first two indicators are global indicators that reflect the core
ambition of Essentials2020 concerning customers’ digital experience:

= a leadership indicator in terms of customer recommendations, as
evidenced by the Net Promoter Score or NPS. This commonly used
metric encompasses all of the plan’s drivers. Orange wants to
become number 1 in NPS for three out of four customers by 2018,
and to remain so;

an indicator that measures the power of the Orange brand: the
Brand Power Index. Orange is aiming for continuous improvement
in this indicator across its markets by 2018 through the new brand
identity and especially as a result of the proof it will provide
customers concerning their improved digital experience.

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

Beyond this, Orange has one ambition per driver:

= for the first driver on richer connectivity, Orange has set an
ambitious objective of tripling the average data speeds of its
customers on its fixed and mobile networks by 2018 compared
to 2014;

= for the second driver on the customer relationship, Orange is aiming
for 50% digitization of interactions with its customers by 2018;

for the third driver on the people-oriented and digital employer
model, Orange has chosen an indicator identical to that chosen for
its customers, based on recommendation. Orange is aiming for
9 employees out of 10 to recommend Orange as an employer
by 2018;

= for the fourth driver on the Enterprise market, Orange has chosen
to measure the success of the transformation of its Enterprise
business model towards IT services. The Group aims to raise the
share of IT services in the Orange Business Services revenue mix
by 10 points by 2020;

= for the last driver, the selected indicator will measure the success
of diversification into new services, with connected objects and
mobile finance services. The objective is for these new services to
contribute more than one billion euros to the Group's revenues in
2018.

Financial objectives

In each section, risk factors are presented in diminishing order of
importance, as determined by the Company at the date of filing the
current Registration Document. Orange may change its view of their
relative importance at any time, particularly if new external or internal
facts come to light.

Several other sections of this Registration Document also discuss
risks in some detail:

- for risks related to Orange's general strategy, see Section 2.3
Orange's group strategy;

2.4.1. Operational risks

Operational risks mainly include risks related to the telecommunications.
sector, risks related to strategy and the economic environment and
risks relating to human resources.

The rapid growth in broadband use (fixed or mobile) allows
global players of the Internet sector the opportunity to establish
a direct link with telecommunications operators’ customers, thus
depriving the latter, including Orange, of a share of their revenues
and margins. If this phenomenon continues or intensifies, it could
seriously impair the financial position and outlook of the operators.

The increased use of networks for value-added services has led to
the emergence of new powerful players, the Over The Top providers
(OTT). Competition with these players to control customer relations is
growing and could erode the operators’ market position. This direct
relationship with customers is a source of value for operators and to
lose part or all of it to new entrants could affect revenues, margins,
the financial position and outlook of telecommunications operators
like Orange.

In response, Orange has adopted a strategy aimed at making
significant investments to increase the capacity of its transport and
aggregation networks and to set itself apart based on the quality of
the high-capacity broadband service offered; and supplying more
innovative and attractive communication services.

There is, however, no guarantee that this strategy, and particularly the
innovative nature of certain investments, will be sufficient to offset the
pressure from new entrants. With no assurance of profitability on
these investments, the financial position and outlook of Orange could
be affected.

Orange may be held liable for the loss, release, unauthorized
disclosure to third parties or inappropriate modification of customer
data. Its liability may also be triggered or its reputation damaged
by its Internet access and hosting services.

Orange's activities may trigger the loss, disclosure, unauthorized
communication to third parties or inappropriate modification of the
data of its customers or the general public, particularly their banking
details, which are stored on its infrastructure or carried by its
networks.

These losses could arise (i) from the accelerated implementation of
new services or new applications, for example those relating to billing
and customer relationship management, (ii) from the launch of new
activities in the field of connected objects, (iii) from malicious acts
(including cyber attacks) particularly aimed at the theft of personal
data or (iv) possible negligence within Orange or the Group's
outsourcing partners.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

Moreover, Orange may in some countries be obliged to disclose
personal data to third parties under legal regimes that fail to offer the
same protection as France, which could damage the Company's
reputation and brand.

Recourse to liability proceedings is facilitated in a number of countries
by legislation that has strengthened operators’ obligations, and it
could become even easier in the future should the legislation become
more stringent.

Such incidents could have a considerable impact on the Group's
reputation and a heavy impact on its liability, including its criminal
liability and hence have an adverse impact on the Group's future
profits.

Orange is exposed to the risk of an interruption of its networks
and services following cyber attacks, sabotage, outages or
human errors affecting critical hardware or software, malfunctioning
of network equipment, failure of a key supplier or network
saturation.

Damage or interruptions to the service provided to customers may
occur following cyber attacks (on networks and IT systems), outages
(hardware or software), human errors or sabotage of critical hardware
or software, failure of a critical supplier, or if the network in question
does not have sufficient capacity to meet the growing usage needs,
or during the implementation of new applications or software.

Among these risks of interruption, telecommunications operators are
especially exposed to malicious actions and cyber attacks because
of the vital nature of telecommunications in the functioning of the
economy. Despite the steps taken by Orange to protect its network,
the growing frequency of such attacks increases the risk of an
interruption to its services.

As a result of the rationalization of the network based on the
implementation of all-IP technologies, the increase in the size of the
service platforms and the relocation of equipment into fewer buildings,
such service interruptions may in the future affect a greater number
of customers and more than one country simultaneously.

Although impossible to quantify, the impact of such events could
seriously damage the Group's reputation, trigger its liability and result
in a reduction of traffic and hence revenue affecting its profits and
outlook. If they were to occur on a nationwide or multinational scale,
they might also create a crisis potentially affecting the security of the
countries concerned.

The technical infrastructure belonging to telecommunications
operators are vulnerable to damage or interruptions caused by
natural disasters, fires, wars, acts of terrorism, intentional damage,
malicious acts, or other similar events.

A natural disaster or other unforeseen incidents affecting Orange's
installations could cause significant damage generating high repair
costs. In most cases, Orange has no insurance for damage to its lines
and must assume the full cost of the repairs itself. Furthermore, the
damage caused by such major disasters may have more long-term
consequences resulting in significant expense for Orange and which
would harm its image, results and outlook. In addition, weather
phenomena associated with climate change may increase the
seriousness of disasters and of the damage caused.

The scope of Orange activities and the interconnection of the
networks mean that the Group is highly exposed to the risk of
fraud, which could reduce revenues and margins and damage
its image.

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

As all operators, Orange is subject to various fraud issues which can
affect the Company or its customers. Moreover, with technologies and
networks becoming increasingly more complex and the accelerated
implementation of new services or new applications relating notably
to billing and customer relationship management, new types of fraud
which are more difficult to detect or combat could also develop.
Orange's revenues, margins, quality of service and reputation could
be affected.

Part of the Group’s Essentials2020 strategic plan is the development
of mobile financial services which are likely to generate new risks
inherent to the banking business or increase the potential impact
of current risks.

Besides the operational risks that accompany any service, the aims
of developing a business in mobile financial services exposes the
Group to risks including money laundering, terrorist financing and non-
compliance with economic sanction programs. In addition, the
previously mentioned risks of fraud, cyber attack, loss, unauthorized
disclosure or communication of customer data and interruption to
services could be particularly acute when they affect banking services.

Furthermore, the Group could face a risk of non-compliance with
banking regulations via its entities which will have the status of
regulated institutions.

If these risks materialize, they could have an impact on the Group's
financial position, completion of its strategy and image.

The massive number of employees retirements that will occur in
France by 2020 creates the risk of a skills shortage which could
affect the Group’s ability to carry out its projects and development
strategy.

The accelerating pace of retirements during the next few years,
particularly in Orange France, may mean the Group risks a shortage
of skills in certain specialties if it cannot replace retirees with newly
recruited or trained qualified personnel. In these circumstances, Orange's
results and outlook could be affected.

Much of Orange’s revenue is earned in mature countries or
businesses where intense competition among operators to offer
attractive prices and convergent offers could erode profitability
or market share.

The main markets in which Orange operates are mature or even
saturated. Orange therefore faces extremely tough competition,
initially on prices but also on the capacity to deliver convergent offers
(fixed, mobile and high-speed broadband), particularly with the recent
emergence of cable operators such as Numericable in France after
its takeover of SFR.

In response, Orange has chosen to make significant investments in
innovation and continue to conduct a transformation and fixed cost
reduction policy. It has also adjusted its asset portfolio by acquisitions
(such as Jazztel in Spain) and disposals (such as its EE stake in the
UK). Orange has also committed to developing new activities such as
mobile financial services and connected objects.

If Orange is unable to successfully implement this strategy, it could
suffer a loss of market share and/or shrinking margins. The same
could occur in the event of a consolidation not involving the Group in
a market where it operates.

For more information on competition, see Chapter 3 Overview of the
Group's business.


--- Page 32 ---

Against the background of consolidation in the European
telecommunications sector, Orange has in the past and is likely
in the future to make significant acquisitions that could raise
integration risks.

In 2015, the Group contributed to integration of the European industry
by acquiring Jazztel. If Orange should make other significant
acquisitions as the sector continues to consolidate it could face a risk
of difficulties in integrating newly acquired entities or businesses that
could have a material impact on its margins and profits.

Orange is relying on sources of growth in the countries where
the Company has invested. Investments already made may fail
to bring the expected returns, and may even generate unexpected
commitments and the Group could be faced with increased
country risk, including from corruption. The Group’s results,
outlook and image could be impacted.

The Group's growth partly depends on its activities in regions of the
world undergoing rapid economic development. Orange has thus
invested in telecommunications companies located in the Middle East
and in Africa. Political instability or changes in the economic, legal or
social landscape in these regions may call into question the outlook
on profits held when these investments were made. International
economic sanctions imposed on these countries could also have an
impact on the value of these investments.

In addition, these geographical areas can pose difficulties or specific
risks related to internal controls or non-compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption rules. Despite the
Group's drive to strengthen its anti-corruption policy, corruption cases
could occur, which could have an adverse impact, particularly on the
Group's image.

Other geographical areas where the Group operates, including central
and eastern Europe, are also exposed to risks of geopolitical instability
and non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations which could
threaten the outlook on profits held when these investments were made.

If the expected growth in revenues from these various geographical
areas was not achieved or if Orange was not able to render them
profitable, the Group's financial position and results could be affected.

Exposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunications
equipment raises concerns for possible health adverse effects.
Perceptions of this risk could worsen or a deleterious effect may
one day be scientifically established, which would have negative
consequences for the business and results of operators such as
Orange.

In many countries, concerns have been raised regarding the possible
health risks linked to exposure to electromagnetic fields from
telecommunications equipment (primarily mobile handsets, mobile
antennas, WiFi).

Although the health authorities have thus far found no health risks
from exposure to electromagnetic fields below the limits recommended
by the specialist international commission (ICNIRP), Orange cannot
predict the conclusions of future scientific research or studies by

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

international organizations and scientific committees called upon to
examine these issues. If health risks are eventually scientifically
demonstrated, there would probably be a resulting decline in the use
of mobile telecommunications services, difficulties and additional
expense in rolling out mobile antennas and wireless networks and an
increase in litigation.

In the absence of scientific certainty, public authorities have nevertheless
introduced strict regulations and health authorities have issued various
precautionary usage measures. These regulations have tended to
become more stringent over time and this trend could continue. The
same is true of cases where various courts have ordered operators
to dismantle mobile antennas and compensate neighbors. Such cases.
could increase in number. The regulatory and case law developments
could lead to a reduction in coverage zones, deterioration of the
quality of service and customer dissatisfaction, as well as a slowdown
in the roll-out of mobile antennas and an increase in the costs of
network roll-outs, which could have a significant impact on the Orange
brand and the Group's results and financial position.

The perception of risks by the public or employees could also lead to
a decrease in the number of customers and lower consumption by
customers, as well as an increase in lawsuits or other consequences
including, in particular, opposition to the construction of or even the
existence of mobile antennas.

For further information, see Section 5.6.3.7 Health and safety of
customers.

If a new global financial crisis were to erupt in future, its impact
on the economy could depress consumption and materially
affect Orange’s business and results.

If a new financial crisis struck global markets, the macroeconomic
situation could deteriorate, depressing household spending and business.
activity, which could materially affect Orange’s revenue and profits.

For further information on the impact of the economic situation on the
Orange group, see also financial risks in Section 2.4.3 below.

In 2009, Orange was faced with a major workforce crisis in
France. Since 2010, the Group has implemented an ambitious
human resources program to respond to this crisis. However,
factors internal or external to the Group, such as the difficult
economic context could hinder the successful implementation
of this program and thus have a material impact on the Group’s
image, operations, and results.

In 2008 and 2009, the Group was faced with a major crisis relating to
psycho-social risks and anxiety at work, the effects of which
continued after this period. Despite many measures taken since under
the Orange People’s Charter and continuous monitoring in place, the
project may fail to achieve the expected results and the crisis may re-
emerge, affecting the Group's image, its operations and its results.
Although the Group believes that the cost of implementing such
projects should be more than offset for by the benefits to the
Company and its employees, this project could however come into
conflict with certain cost-cutting plans.

2.4.2 Legal risks

Orange operates in highly regulated markets, where its flexibility
to manage its business is limited. Orange’s business activities
and results could be materially affected by legislative, regulatory
or government policy changes.

In most countries in which it operates, Orange must comply with
various regulatory obligations governing the provision of its products
and services, primarily relating to obtaining and renewing
telecommunication licenses, as well as to oversight by authorities
seeking to maintain effective competition in the electronic
communications markets. Furthermore, in certain countries Orange
faces regulatory constraints as a result of its historically dominant
position in the fixed-line telecommunications market, in particular in
France and Poland.

Orange's business activities and operating income may be materially
adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or government policy
changes, and in particular by decisions taken by regulatory or
competition authorities in connection with:

= amendment or renewal on unfavorable conditions, or even
withdrawal of fixed-line or mobile operator licenses;

conditions governing network access (primarily those in connection
with roaming or infrastructure sharing);

service rates;

the introduction of new taxes or increases to existing taxes for
telecommunications companies;

consumerism legislation;

merger policy;

regulations affecting operators of competing sectors, such as
cable;

regulations governing data security;

regulation of banking and electronic payments and any similar
regulations requiring compliance such as laws and rules on
economic sanctions.

Such decisions could materially affect the Group's revenues and
results.

For further information on risks related to regulations, see Section 2.2
Regulations.

Orange is continually involved in legal proceedings and disputes
with regulatory authorities, competitors, or other parties. The
outcome of such proceedings is generally uncertain and could
have a material impact on its results or financial position.

Orange believes that, on a general basis and in all countries in which
it is present, it complies with all the specific regulations in force, as
well the conditions governing its operator licenses. However, the
Company is not able to predict the decisions of oversight and legal
authorities who are regularly asked to rule on such issues. Should
Orange be ordered to pay damages or a fine due to the non-respect
of a given regulation in force by the relevant authorities in a country in
which it is present, the Group's financial position and results could be
adversely affected.

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

In addition, Orange — particularly in France and Poland — is frequently
involved in legal proceedings with its competitors and with the
regulatory authorities due to its preeminent position in certain markets
and the complaints filed against Orange may be very substantial. In
the past, fines of several tens of millions of euros and even several
hundreds of millions of euros were imposed on the Group for
concerted practices or for abuse of a dominant position, such as the
350 million euro fine imposed on December 17, 2015, by the French
competition authorities for illicitly stifling competition in the “enterprise”
market since the 2000s. Finally, the Group may be the object of
substantial commercial lawsuits with potentially very significant
penalties. The outcome of lawsuits is inherently unpredictable.

In the case of proceedings involving European competition authorities,
the maximum fine provided for by law is 10% of the consolidated
revenues of the company at fault (or the group to which it belongs, as
the case may be).

The main proceedings involving Orange are detailed in Note 14
Litigation to the consolidated financial statements as well as Section
4.4 Recent events. Developments in or the results of some or all of
the ongoing proceedings could have a material adverse impact on
Orange's results or financial position.

The profitability of certain investments and Orange’s strategy in
certain countries could be affected by disagreements with its
partners in companies that it does not control.

Orange operates some of its businesses through companies that it
does not control. Articles of incorporation or agreements for some of
these activities require that some major decisions, such as the
approval of business plans or timing and size of dividends, need
approval from the different partners. Should Orange and its partners
disagree regarding these decisions, the profitability of these
investments, their contribution to Orange's results and the strategy
pursued by Orange in the countries in which these companies are
located, could be adversely affected.

23% of Orange’s capital is owned by the French public sector,
which could, in practice, allow it to determine the outcome of
votes at Shareholders’ Meetings.

At December 31, 2015, the French public sector held 23% of
Orange’s capital through the French government which directly owned
13.4% of the shares and voting rights, and Bpifrance Participations
(formerly the FSI) which holds 9.6% of shares and voting rights. As of
April 3, 2016, it has double voting rights on its registered shares as
the Florange law of March 29, 2014 comes into force (see Section
6.2.1 Distribution of capital and voting rights). Moreover, the French
public sector has three representatives on the Board of Directors out
of a total 15 members. On February 18, 2016, the French State and
Bpifrance Participations signed a new shareholders’ agreement to act
jointly. Since there are no other significant shareholder groups, the
public sector could, in practice, determine the outcome of votes on
issues that require a simple majority at Shareholders’ Meetings and
exercise a veto over issues requiring a two-thirds majority (see Section
6.2 Major shareholders). The public sector could, for instance, veto a
proposed merger with another operator or a takeover bid on Orange.

2.4.3 Financial risks

Liquidity risk
Orange’s results and outlook could be affected if the terms of
access to capital markets become difficult.

Orange raises most of its finance from capital markets (particularly the
bond market), which are heavily influenced by the evolution of the
economic environment. A new financial crisis could restrict or make
significantly more expensive Orange's access to its usual sources of
finance through a rise it the spreads it pays on its borrowings.

Also, concerns persist regarding the consequences of the Basel Ill
and Solvency II regulations, which seek to strengthen the capital held
by banks and insurance companies, respectively. Banks are reducing
their outstanding loans forcing companies to increase funding
obtained on bond markets, which is Orange's main source of
financing. The tightening of prudential rules in the finance sector could
reduce companies’ access to financing or refinancing from the bond
market or bank loans necessary for their business, even for first-rate
borrowers or issuers such as Orange. Any inability to access the
financial markets and/or obtain financing on reasonable terms could
have a material adverse effect on Orange. The Group could, in
particular, be required to allocate a significant portion of its available
cash to service or pay off debt, to the detriment of investment or
compensation for shareholders. In any case, Orange's results, cash
flows and, more generally, financial position and flexibility may be
adversely affected.

See Note 11.3 Liquidity risk management to the consolidated financial
statements, which sets out, in particular, different financing sources
available to Orange, the maturity on its debt and changes to its rating,
as well as Note 11.4 Management of covenants, which contains
information on the limited commitments of the Orange group in
relation to financial ratios and in the event of default or material
adverse change.

Interest rate risk

Orange’s business activities could be adversely affected by
interest rate fluctuations.

In the normal course of its business, Orange obtains most of its
funding from capital markets (particularly the bond market) and a small
part from bank loans.

Since most of its debt is at a fixed rate, Orange has limited exposure
to increases in market interest rates. Of course the Group is still
exposed to interest rate increases for future financing.

To limit exposure to interest rate fluctuations, Orange from time to time
makes use of financial instruments (derivatives) but cannot guarantee
that these transactions will completely limit its exposure or that
suitable financial instruments will be available at reasonable prices. In
the event that Orange cannot use financial instruments or if its financial
instrument strategy proves ineffective, cash flows and earnings may
be adversely affected.

In addition, hedging costs stemming from interest rate fluctuations
could, generally, increase in line with market liquidity and banks’
positions.

The management of interest rate risk and an analysis of the sensitivity
of the Group's position to changes in interest rates are set out in Note
11.1 Interest rate risk management to the consolidated financial
statements.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

Credit-rating risks

If Orange’s credit rating is downgraded or placed under
surveillance, or its outlook is revised, by rating agencies, its
borrowing costs could increase and in certain circumstances the
Company’s access to the capital it needs could be limited.

Orange's credit rating is partly based on factors over which it has no
control, namely conditions affecting the telecommunications industry
in general or conditions affecting certain countries or regions in which
it operates, and can be changed at any time by the rating agencies.

The Group's financial rating and its outlook have been downgraded
in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The rating may be revised again at any time
in light of evolving economic circumstances, or following a downturn
in the Company's results or performance or simply due to a change
in rating agencies’ perceptions of these factors, which would have a
material adverse effect on its results and financial position.

Risk of asset impairment

Orange has booked substantial amounts of goodwill following
its acquisitions. Under accounting standards, impairment losses
have in the past and may again in the future be recorded against
goodwill and other assets in Orange’s accounts, including those
of Orange SA, which could reduce its ability to pay dividends.
Orange’s results and financial position could also be affected by
the downturn in equity markets in relation to disposal of its

At December 31, 2015, the gross value of goodwill recognized by
Orange following its acquisitions was 32.6 billion euros, not including
impairment losses on the goodwill of associates.

The values in use of the businesses, which are most of the recoverable
amounts and which support the book values of long-term assets
including goodwill (and investment securities in the statutory financial
statements) are sensitive to the valuation method and the assumptions
used in the models. They are also sensitive to any change in the
business environment that is different to the assumptions used. Orange
recognizes assets as impaired if events or circumstances occur that
involve material adverse changes of a permanent nature affecting the
economic environment or the assumptions and targets used at the
time of the acquisition.

Over the past five years, Orange recognized significant impairment
losses in respect of its interests in Poland, Egypt, Romania and
Belgium, in particular. At December 31, 2015, the cumulative amount
of impairment of goodwill on continuing operations was 5.5
billion euros, not including impairment losses on the goodwill of
associates.

New events or adverse circumstances could conduct Orange to
review the present value of its assets and to recognize further
substantial impairment losses that could have an adverse effect on
its results.

In addition, in the case of disposals or listings on a stock exchange,
the value of certain subsidiaries could be affected by changes in the
stock and debt markets.

For further information on the impairment of goodwill and recoverable
amounts (particularly key assumptions and sensitivity), see Notes 6
Goodwill, 7 Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
and 9 Interests in associates and joint ventures to the consolidated
financial statements and Section 4.3.2.2 From Group Reported
EBITDA to operating income.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

Credit risk and/or counterparty risk
on financial transactions

The insolvency or deterioration in the financial position of a bank
or other institution with which Orange has a financial agreement
may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
financial position.

In the normal course of its business, Orange makes use of derivatives
to manage exchange rate and interest rate risks, using financial
institutions as counterparties. cash collateral is lodged with all bank
counterparties with which the derivatives are contracted. Nevertheless.
a residual credit risk may remain if one or more of these counterparties
defaults on its commitments.

Moreover, Orange may in future have difficulties to using its 5.7
billion euro undrawn syndicated credit facility, whose main maturity
date is 2018, if several of the banks with which the derivatives are
contracted faced liquidity problems or could no longer meet their
obligations.

Finally, its cash management investments expose Orange to counterparty
risk if the financial institutions where it has invested should go
bankrupt. See Note 11.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management
to the consolidated financial statements.

The international banking system is such that financial institutions are
interdependent. As a result, the collapse of a single institution (or even
rumors regarding the financial position of one of them) may increase
the risk for the other institutions, which would increase exposure to
counterparty risk for Orange. Orange's positioning in regulated activities
in the banking sector focuses this risk on certain Group entities.

For customer-related credit and counterparty risk, see Note 11.5 and
Note 3.3 Trade receivables to the consolidated financial statements.

Foreign exchange risk

Orange’s results and cash position are exposed to exchange rate
fluctuations.

In general, currency markets remained highly volatile during 2015 and
at the start of 2016, increasing uncertainty over exchange rate changes.

The main currencies in which Orange is exposed to a major foreign
exchange risk are the Polish zloty, the Egyptian pound, the US dollar
and the British pound sterling. Fluctuations from one period to the
next in the average exchange rate for a given currency could have a
material effect on the revenues and expenses in this currency, which

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

would in turn have a material effect on Orange's results. In addition to
the main currencies, Orange operates in other monetary zones,
including certain emerging countries (African countries). A fall in the
currencies of these countries would have an adverse effect on the
Group's consolidated revenues and results. Based on 2015 data, the
theoretical impact of a 10% fall against the euro in the main currencies
in which the Group's subsidiaries operate would have cut consolidated
revenues by 854 million euros (-2%) and Reported EBITDA by
194 million euros (-2%).

Finally, as a result of focusing its development strategy on emerging
countries, the share of Group business exposed to foreign exchange
risk is likely to rise in the future.

When preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements, the
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros
at the closing rate. This translation could have a negative impact on
the consolidated balance sheet, assets and liabilities and equity, for
potentially significant amounts, as well as on net income in the event
of disposal of its subsidiaries.

Orange manages the foreign exchange risk on commercial transactions
(stemming from operations) and financial transactions (stemming from
financial debt) in the manner set out in Note 11.2 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Notably, Orange makes use of derivatives to hedge its exposure to
foreign exchange risk but cannot guarantee that suitable hedging
instruments will be available at reasonable prices.

To the extent that Orange had not used hedging instruments to hedge
part of this risk, its cash flows and results could be affected.

See Notes 10.7 Derivatives instruments and 10.8 Cash flow hedges
to the consolidated financial statements.

Equity risk

Future public sector disposals of Orange shares could affect the
share price.

At 31 December 2015, the French public sector held 23% of Orange's
capital, after the disposal of 1.9% in 2014 and a further 2% in
July 2015 (see Section 6.2 Major shareholders). If it decided to
continue reducing its stake in Orange, such a disposal, or the
perception that such a disposal was imminent, could have an adverse
effect on the share price.

This Chapter contains forward-looking statements about Orange, particularly Section 3.1 Overview of Business. These forward-looking
statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the
forward-looking statements. The most significant risks are detailed in Section 2.4 Risk factors. Please also consult information under the heading

Forward-looking statements at the start of this document.

3.1 Overview of business

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

Telecommunications operators’ revenue totaled 32.8 billion euros year-
on-year at the end of the third quarter of 2015, down by 3.0% in one
year (source: Arcep, Q3 2015). While fixed narrowband revenues
continued their downward trend as a result of the constant decline in
line numbers, fixed broadband revenues continued their growth due to
the increasing number of accesses. First observed in 2011, the decline
in revenues from mobile services came to a halt, as the retail market
price reduction trend dissipated.

Fixed-line telephony market

Telephone contracts (38.7 million at September 30, 2015) have been
declining since mid-2010 (down 0.8% year-on-year in the third quarter
of 2015). As a matter of fact, the higher number of broadband voice
telephone contracts (25.7 million in the third quarter of 2015, up by
1.3 million year-on-year) did not offset the declining number of PSTN
subscriptions (-1.5 million year-on-year). As they only have one VoIP
contract, fixed-lines (20.4 million at the end of September 2015, up by
0.8 million year-on-year) have held the lion's share since mid-2012 and
have been expanding consistently. This rise was mostly connected to
the growth of completely unbundled lines: +360,000 year-on-year, i.e.
a total of 11.8 million lines at the end of September 2015 (source:
Arcep, Q3 2015).

The number of high speed broadband and broadband Internet
accesses was 26.6 million at September 30, 2015, up by 3.6% from
September 2014. Broadband lines account for 22.7 million contracts
(over 97% via DSL access) and fell by 2.0% year-on-year. The number
of high speed broadband contracts reached 3.9 million, up by
1.4 million year-on-year. The growth in the overall number of Internet
accesses was entirely driven by the increased number of high speed
broadband accesses (source: Arcep, Q3 2015).

Revenue from fixed-line services (telephone and Internet) reached
14.6 billion euros year-on-year in the third quarter of 2015. On the one
hand, revenues from narrowband fixed-line services (3.9 billion euros
excl. VAT) have shrunk by more than 10% per annum for several years
now (-9.6% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2015). On the other
hand, revenues from broadband and high speed broadband fixed-line
services continued to grow, reaching 10.8 billion euros year-on-year in
the third quarter of 2015 and thereby accounting for 74% of the overall
revenues from fixed-line services (source: Arcep Q3 2015).


--- Page 38 ---

So-called convergence offers (bundled fixed-line and mobile telephony,
Internet access and TV) continue to grow. The spread of Internet access
has gone hand-in-hand with the type of Web use fostered by the growth
of social networks, TV, as well as music and video downloads.

Mobile telephony market

The number of active SIM cards reached 81.8 million at
September 30, 2015, corresponding to a penetration rate of 123.2%
of the population (+2.9 percentage points year-on-year). The
2.5 million rise in SIM card numbers year-on-year in the third quarter
of 2015 was driven by contracts, up by 2.3 million year-on-year for
conventional contracts and 2.1 million for M2M (Machine to Machine)
cards. Conversely, the number of prepaid cards fell since mid-2012
and they were down by 1.9 million in the third quarter of 2015 (source:
Arcep Q3 2015).

The market of connected objects SIM cards continues to grow. M2M
SIM cards are used to connect remotely to devices (vehicle fleet
tracking, remote reading of meters, sensors, alarms, remote
interventions). The number of M2M cards was 10 million at
September 30, 2015. Growth in the third quarter was almost double
than in the two preceding quarters (+860,000 cards).

Mobile services generated 14.3 billion euros over 12 rolling months in
revenues in the third quarter of 2015, up by approximately 244 million
year-on-year (versus a fall of approximately 231 million in Q3 2014).
After following a downward trend since mid-2011, revenues from
mobile services are now up for the second consecutive quarter
(source: Arcep Q3 2015). Outgoing traffic from mobiles is experiencing
strong growth since 2012 and stood at 37.0 billion minutes in the third
quarter of 2015, up by 3.1% over Q3 2014, corresponding to 1.1 billion
additional minutes.

Changes in consumption trends are boosting data services on mobile
networks, whose expansion is driven by mobile carriers’ offers which
include data services (Internet browsing, mobile TV) and the extension
of new generation (8G and 4G) networks. After doubling in each of
the previous quarters on a yearly basis, data traffic was up by 76.7%
in the third quarter of 2015. Data usage on Internet-only cards was
also up sharply (+60.3% year-on-year) and accounted for 7.3% of
data traffic (source: Arcep Q3 2015).

The number of SMS and MMS sent (50.6 billion) during the third
quarter of 2015, continued to rise (+4.9% year-on-year), but at a
slower rate since the beginning of 2013. The number of MMS sent
during the quarter exceeded one billion for the first time, and
continued to grow at a fast rate (+25.3% in the third quarter of 2015.)
MMS accounted for 2% of all personal message exchanges (source:
Arcep Q3 2015).

have improved their services while adapting their pricing policy in
response to the growth of S/M-only deals.

The prepaid market continued to fall sharply. The number of prepaid
cards (13.1 million at September 30, 2015) has been declining since

prepaid cards was down by 1.2 million compared with the third
quarter of 2014 (source: Arcep, Q3 2015). The market for so-called
community prepaid cards nevertheless remained very buoyant.
Operators accordingly expanded their offers, launching unlimited top-
ups and prepaid cards with unlimited validity.

Traditional fixed-line telephony services

Further to the rapid growth in full unbundling, wholesale contracts,
and wholesale naked ADSL access to third-party Internet service
providers, traditional telephone service business is on the decline.
The downward trend has nevertheless slowed down in terms of
both revenues and PSTN connections (down 11.4% and 12.1%
respectively compared with end-2014), thanks to the aggressive
marketing strategy implemented since 2012 to simplify offers while
providing more comprehensive services.

Online, Internet access and Multimedia services

At end-December 2015, Orange had a total of 10.7 million Internet
customers, an increase of 3.7% year-on-year. A total of 9.8 million
Livebox were rented at end-December 2015 (+5.5% compared with
end-December 2014). The growth of convergent offers continued in
2015, with the number of Open customers (fixed and mobile) reaching
7.0 million at end-2015 (+15% compared with December 2014).

IP telephony had 9.6 million customers end-December 2015 and
continued to grow (+5.9%) albeit at a slower pace than in 2014
(+4.3%).

Television by ADSL and satellite grew by 6.1%, with 6.4 million
customers at end-December 2015. At end-October 2014, Orange
launched a new navigation interface (Polaris) offering improved
content access (in particular VoD/SVoD) and integrated services in
Livebox.

The broadband customer base increased by 3.7%, with a share of
approximately 42% of new broadband and high speed broadband
subscriptions over the year, thanks to the commercial success of fiber
services and convergence offers. Broadband ARPU fell by 0.9%, as.
it continued to be affected by the increasing penetration of Open
quadruple play offers including partial rate discounts. Nonetheless,
ARPU fell at a slower rate than in 2014 thanks to the greater share of
fiber services within the customer base.

At the end of 2015, the total number of Orange mobile customers.
was 28.4 million, up 4.9%. This was due to the significant growth in
contracts (including M2M), while prepaid offers continue to decline.
Orange increased its subscriber base to 24.1 million at end-
December 2015 (+9.9% compared with 2014) thanks to its
segmentation strategy for the Consumer and Enterprise markets and
the development of M2M packages.

Orange is present in all market segments, offering a low-rate service
range under the Sosh brand, available only on the Internet, with no
commitment and no handset. Sosh had a total of 2.9 million
customers at end- December 2015.

The number of Orange 4G customers was approximately 8.0 million
at December 31, 2015, a year-on-year increase of 4.3 million 4G
customers. Since 2015, Orange only markets 4G offers, including so-
called entry-level packages (Sosh, M6 Mobile). Orange's key offerings,
namely Origami, remain divided in 3 ranges:

= Origami Zen offers are for customers who need only a small amount
of Internet connectivity, but wish to use additional services (Orange
Cloud and TV), as well as benefit from round-the-clock support
including a loan telephone in the event of a fault or theft;

= Origami Play offers are suitable for more intense Internet usage and
international connectivity;

= Origami Jet offers are for customers wanting the best smartphones,
and very intense Internet usage in France and abroad.

Orange pressed ahead with its family-based strategy through its
flagship Open offer and the development of multi-line contracts. The
Open offers are available in the same ranges as Origami and include
the same level of service. This refurbishment increased the volume of
offers on the core Open and Origami ranges, and also helped to
improve the premium customer mix in 2015, as reflected by the
growth of the contract customer mix (84.9% of customers at end-
2015, compared with 81.1% at end-2014).

At the same time, the MVNO customer base hosted on the Orange
network declined substantially (-25.1% year-on-year, a similar pace
as in 2014) due to the success of low-cost offers and heightened
competition at the entry level.

Average monthly revenues per user (ARPU) were down 1.3% in 2015
compared with December 2014. The smaller decline compared with
2014 (+6 percentage points) reflects the end of the impact of price
adjustments across the mobile range in 2012 and 2013 and, in 2015,
price stabilization on a market which, however, continues to be
perturbed by regular promotional campaigns.

Machine to Machine SIM cards continued to grow (+65% year-on-
year), reaching a total number of 3.9 million at end-December 2015.
The M2M segment is one of Orange's growth drivers.

On the background of fierce competition and market restructuring,
Orange has retained its leadership in traditional business areas and
continued to innovate by launching new services, such as corporate
payments.

Three major trends marked the professional/SME market in 2015:
= higher value customers in the broadband and convergence offers;

= lower churn rates for broadband customers, in line with the trend
observed in the second quarter of 2014, thanks to improved
satisfaction rates;

= lastly, the continuous pursuit of sources of growth, such as the
Cloud Pro services with, in particular, the emergence of Web site offers.

service;

to continue to adapt to its environment by greater digitalization of
customer relations;

to continue efforts on the structure of its direct and indirect costs;

to continue adapting modes of operating and organization, in
managing 25,000 retirement departures expected in France
between now and 2020 (approximately 1/3 of its employees) in
accordance with the Social Contract.

Overview of business

To achieve these objectives, Orange will use three main levers:
= high-speed fixed and mobile broadband:

— by continuing the deployment of fiber optic networks and the
number of fiber connections in order to offer the best technology
for Internet access over fixed lines, while preserving the value of
the copper network,

— by supporting a continuous increase in our 4G base with the
challenge of maintaining a premium price on marketed offers;

= convergence, leveraging the position as the incumbent operator in
this field so as to significantly increase customer loyalty;

innovation in services to make them a powerful tool in customer
retention and a driver of revenue growth, with:

- continued marketing of new products and services and in
particular the development of connected objects,

— launch of a new Internet box integrating new services in line with
new usage trends (multi-screen, 4K ultra high definition) planned
in the first half of 2016,

— the development of content uses such as entertainment in
music, video and video games,

— the Cloud and web services in business and retail markets,

— mobile payment and financial services.

Overview of the group’s business
Overview of business

Revenue trends confirmed recovery in 2015, with a fall of 3.5%, which
was less extensive than in 2014 (-8%), associated with the growing
usage of high speed data boosted by the development of 4G and
FTTH networks. Convergence has already become common-place
‘on the market.

Fixed-line telephony and Internet market

The number of fixed telephone lines decreased by 0.1% in 2015, while
the number of Internet customers reached 13.4 million, an increase
of 4.1% (compared with 6.1% in 2014).

The Spanish market was marked by the growth of high speed
broadband throughout 2015. Telefonica, Orange/Jazztel and
Vodafone/ONO made massive investments in FTTH technology, which
made it possible to reach a number of over 21 million connected
households at end-2015. The number of customers with FTTH
access doubled, reaching 3 million subscribers at end-2015.

Convergence is now a norm on the market. The number of mobile
and fixed access convergence offers reached 9.5 million, accounting
for over 72% of the overall customer base (source: Orange estimate).
Convergence offers, including TV, have also recorded strong growth,
thereby accelerating the development of the audiovisual content
market. At the end of 2015, 6.2 million customers had subscribed to
TV services, attracted by the new football broadcast offers and
improved contents.

Mobile telephony market

The total number of customers rose by 1.6% in 2015, reaching
56.4 million. Subscription penetration was up by 5.6% reaching
43.1 million and accounting for 77% of the overall customer base. On

13.2 million. The number of convergence offer customers reached
17 million, accounting for over 47% of the mobile subscription
customer base. High speed mobile Internet services continue to grow.
At the end of 2015, over 11 million customers had a 4G plan,
corresponding to 20% penetration of the mobile market (source:

Orange Espagne based its 2015 strategy on integrating Jazztel to
leverage the combined potential of the 4G and FTTH networks,
growing the number of TV customers and expanding the convergence
customer base.

2015 was marked by a 2.3% drop of revenues on a yearly basis, due
to the sharp decline of mobile equipment sales. Fixed-line service
revenues were up by 5.7% over 2014, while mobile services
continued to improve with revenues of 2.403 million euros in 2015,
down 4.5%, compared with a 11.8% drop in 2014 on a comparable
basis. The number of convergent customers reached 1.7 million,
accounting for 81% of the fixed-line broadband customer base. The
success of its convergence offers enabled Orange to expand its
broadband customer base by 6.7% in one year.

Orange was able to significantly boost its very high speed broadband
(VHBB) capacity, with 6.8 million connectable households at end-
2015, helped by the Jazztel acquisition, new rollouts, and the network
sharing agreement signed with Vodafone. In December 2015,
Orange's FTTH customer base (including Jazztel) grew by a factor of
3.9, or 809,000 subscribers.

New TV offers also worked as growth drivers. At the end of 2015,
Orange TV had 306,000 subscribers (corresponding to a 2.8 fold
increase in the TV customer base from 2014), thanks to the success
of the new football broadcast offers and improved contents.

Orange maintained its position as top net seller in the mobile market
and also expanded its subscriber base to 12 million, up 7% over
2014. Orange's strategy focuses on providing value-for-money, high-
quality services, including low-cost offers, to meet the needs of all
customer segments. Thus, Orange Espagne covers all segments:
bundles, with Canguro Sin Limites and Canguro ahorro, the upper
and mid-market range with Tucan and Delfin, big data users with
Ballena, and the low end of the market with Colibri. Orange Espagne
is also a key player on the low-cost market with two offers available
only on the Internet, Amena and Simyo, as well as Mundo, targeted
at migrants. Simyo reached 683,000 customers in 2015 and Amena
312,000. Moreover, Orange Espagne markets a wide range of 4G
offers, both for convergent and mobile only customers, reaching
5.1 million customers in December 2015, thereby increasing its 4G
customer base by a factor of 2.2 in comparison with 2014.

The Polish economy continued to grow at a slightly faster pace than
in 2014. At the same time, falling oil and common consumer goods
prices kept deflation at 0.9% in 2015, while unemployment rate fell to
9.8% (source: Central Polish Bureau of Statistics). These factors had
a positive impact on the disposable income of households and private
consumption, which grew more than 3.1%.

The value of the Polish telecommunications services market went up
by 0.7% in 2015. The main growth driver was wholesale revenues,
while retail revenues (fixed-line and mobile) dropped 2.9% due to
lower average revenues per customer (source: Orange Polska
estimates).

Fixed-line telephony market

The penetration rate of fixed lines continued to decline, shrinking by -
5.3% in 2015 and accounting for 21% of the population at year-end,
compared with 22% at end-2014. The number of fixed broadband
lines fell by 0.5% and revenues were down by 0.9%, compared with
a 1.1% increase in 2014 (Source: Orange Polska).

Telephony markets (both national and international) were deregulated
in 2015. While voice offers are no longer regulated, subscription
prices, which represent more significant amounts, continue to be
regulated.

Mobile telephony market

The number of mobile telephony customers fell by 2.4% in 2015, as
carriers deactivated certain prepaid SIM cards that were generating
neither traffic nor revenue. The number of mobile users came to
56.2 million at end-December 2015, corresponding to a penetration
rate of 146% (compared with 150% in 2014). Revenues were up 3.6%
(source: Orange Polska estimates).

Source: Orange Polska estimates.

As in the case of fixed telephony, affected by a strong shift to mobile
services for several years now, the growing success of mobile
broadband has impacted the development of high-speed fixed
broadband, which was down slightly at the end of 2015. This trend
gathered momentum as all mobile operators launched 4G services
and attractive mobile broadband offers (in terms of prices or high or
even unlimited traffic) and improved geographical coverage. LTE was.
also used in Poland to offer mobile WiFi broadband terminal services
(for instance at home).

In the fixed-line broadband market, Orange Polska is still under strong
competitive pressure from cable television operators, whose market
share is climbing steadily. It was estimated at 35.3% at end-
December 2015 (source: Orange Polska estimates). The commercial
offers of these operators are backed by the investments they make in
infrastructure to deploy the DOCSIS 3.0 standard and expand fiber
access. Their overall market position has been steadily growing,
resulting mainly from high popularity of the bundles they can offer
thanks to their advantageous position on the television market. CATV
is also expanding its offer towards SoHo and SME client segments.

The development of the fixed-line broadband in Poland will be spurred
by the investments made in NGN infrastructure, built on fiber optic
lines with European funding. Mobile broadband, however, is expected

Alternative operators, primarily Netia, still make use of wholesale BSA
and LLU based services. However, the total volume of lines using
bitstream access has been falling for several years now, and there
were 131,000 unbundled lines at end-2015, compared with 152,000
a year earlier.

Poland has four main mobile telephony operators: Orange Polska,
T-Mobile (wholly owned by Deutsche Telekom), Polkomtel (operating
under the PLUS brand, in association with broadcaster and satellite
TV platform Polsat Cyfrowy, owned by Polish magnate Zygmunt
Solorz-Zak), and P4 (held by Tollerton Investments Ltd and Novator
Telecom Poland SARL, trading under the PLAY brand). In 2015, the
four main mobile carriers represented 98% of the total number of
active SIM cards in Poland.

Orange Polska’s estimated market share had increased slightly to
28.4% at end-2015. Orange Polska maintained the second largest
market share in terms of net sales. The overall result was slightly better
than in 2014, and subscription services grew for the second
consecutive year.

However, growing differences in methodology between operators in
the calculation of SIM cards make it increasingly difficult to compare
the data presented by these operators.

Convergent solutions and bundles

To fight off the competition in the mobile and fixed-line segments,
Orange Polska encourages customer loyalty by offering attractive
service bundles. The Orange Open convergence offer includes a
complete range of fixed-line and mobile services, with a progressive
discount for customers who subscribe to new fixed-line services
(including VoIP, broadband and TV), mobile voice and broadband
services. In consumer services, Orange Polska is the only operator
offering this type of convergence solutions, which gives it a significant
competitive edge. At the end of 2015, the number of convergent
customers was 728,000, up 35%. The total number of services sold
under the Orange Open offer exceeded 3 million, which means that
on an average, each customer uses more than four services.

According to a report published by the European Commission,
penetration of convergence services in Poland is weak compared to
other Western European countries. Orange Polska believes the
demand for convergence products will continue to grow and plans to
strengthen its convergence offering to ensure its fiber optic broadband
services are successful.

Fixed voice

Orange Polska continues to work to fight the erosion of its fixed-line
customer base. Customer loyalty was strengthened, in particular with
the Adjusted Home contract, and by lowering the threshold for the
Orange Open loyalty program from 39 to 29 zlotys. Consequently, all
fixed-line telephony contracts are now eligible. The number of lines,
however, continues to fall as fixed-line services are replaced by mobile

technologies driven by the growing availability of unlimited mobile
offers. Broadband customers often cancel their voice subscription
when they terminate their broadband access service, which
contributes to the falling number of fixed telephony lines. As such, the
net loss of voice customers (traditional PSTN telephone or VoIP)
accelerated to 318,000 in 2015, compared with 229,000 in 2014.

Broadband access

In 2015, Orange Polska recorded a fall in the number of broadband
accesses. However, the situation varies depending on the
geographical area. Neostrada bundles and sales (broadband services
offers) grew in areas where the market has been deregulated. In
addition, the share of Neostrada TV bundles and high-speed options
in total sales grew thanks to a uniform price strategy and gadget
offers. Following its customers’ positive reaction to the new offers in
deregulated regions and faced with fierce competition, Orange Polska
decided to apply uniform prices across Poland in June 2015. A single
price was introduced across all three speed options (10, 20 and 80 Mbps).
Lastly, Neostrada prices were lowered by 10 and 20 zlotys for the 10
Mbps and higher speed options, respectively.

In 2015, Orange Polska continued to promote high speed broadband.
As it continued to sell vDSL offers, with over 290,000 customers,
Orange also started to invest in FTTH fiber optic lines and connected
717,000 households. FTTH services were first launched in
October under the Supernova brand, with 17,000 FTTH customers
at end-2015. Orange Polska aims to use FTTH connections to regain
its position on the high speed broadband market in large cities, which
are currently dominated by cable operators.

Overview of the group’s business
Overview of business

Orange Polska had a total 15.9 million mobile customers at end-2015,
an increase of approximately 2%. This growth was entirely due to the
expansion of the contract base, up by more than 682,000, or more
than 9% over 2014. This was the fastest growth rate in years and can
be attributed to several factors:

= the launch of new attractive offers targeted at both the consumer
and business market. These offers were supported by intensive
marketing actions, in particular in the second half of the year;

= the actions taken against cancellation of subscriptions were also
successful, with the churn rate decreased to 3%, to one of the
lowest levels in several years;

dedicated mobile broadband SIM cards, usually activated as part
of a subscription, have become increasingly successful, and the
mobile broadband customer base has grown by approximately
30%.

In addition, contracts have become far more affordable for customers,
which explains the decline in the prepaid customer base.

Total ARPU was 30.3 zlotys in 2015, down by 3.8% (compared with
-9% in 2014). This was primarily due to a falling ARPU for voice and
SMS in the wake of price competition, especially in the business
segment, and the growing popularity of unlimited offers. The launch
of deferred payment plans for handset sales in the second half of
2014 also contributed to the fall in ARPU, as the corresponding
revenues are not included in ARPU, while the cost of the subsidized
handsets is included in the subscription costs. These negative factors
were only partially offset by the higher data ARPU, up 18% in 2015,
driven by the boom in mobile data traffic per customer, up by more

up from 17% in 2014. In addition, the ARPU of prepaid services,
which are not affected by competition on the business market, was
up by over 2% in 2015, (compared with -11% in 2014).

Distribution

Actively focused on delivering excellent sales and after-sales service
to individual and business customers, Orange Polska operates various
distribution channels: points of sale, alternative channels, on-line
sales, telesales and door-to-door sales.

Orange Polska has approximately 800 outlets and franchises, offering
a complete range of products and services. Orange Polska
redesigned its outlets to improve customer experience: eight Smart
Stores were opened, 659 outlets were upgraded to a new format, and
a new smart customer management system was deployed in
5 Orange centers. On-line sales were the fastest growing channel,
with approximately 15% of B2B subscriptions sold on-line. Telesales
are also used to contact customers (mainly for loyalty actions). FTTH
services are marketed door-to-door.

Orange Polska also endeavors to offer its customers a seamless,
consistent experience through multi-channel solutions.

Prepaid cards are sold through a comprehensive network of sales
points including brand outlets of Orange and distributors (convenience
stores, kiosks, gas stations). Orange Prepaid kits are widely available
at close to 40 thousand outlets, and can be recharged in more than
96 thousand outlets.

Orange and T-Mobile continued the co-development process of the
radio network. In June 2015, after optimizing the 1800 MHz GSM
band, the two operators extended their alliance to LTE, with
2X2.5 mHz taken from their own resources to form a continuous
15 mHz spectrum of 1800 mHz LTE bands. Over 10,000 stations
transmit Orange's GSM and UMTS/HSPA signals, while approximately
6,000 stations transmit 4G signals. UMTS and 4G covered over
99.6% and close to 84% of the population, respectively, at the end of
2015.

In October 2015, Orange Polska was awarded two 800 mHz blocks
(10 MHz) and three 2600 mHz blocks (15 mHz) for 15 years at an
auction, thereby significantly improving its positioning.

2016 Outlook

In February 2016, Orange Polska announced its new strategic plan
from 2016 to 2018. The plan includes significant investment to acquire
new customers and deliver better mobile and fixed-line connectivity,
with a view to generating long-term value and reverse negative trends
affecting market shares, revenues and profit growth. The plan is built
around the following objectives:

= guarantee the best fixed-line and mobile connectivity. Orange
Polska wants to be flexible to be able to deliver the best possible
connectivity irrespective of the customer's location. Orange Polska
will be able to use the most suitable technology depending on the
area: fiber, upgraded copper technology, or hybrid fixed-mobile
connection;

be the leader in convergence. Orange Polska will offer to its customers
a wide range of services across the nation, enriched by products

that are not telecom-specific, presenting the benefits of convergence
solutions. In addition to improved products, Orange Polska will use
marketing intelligence techniques, benefiting from a better
understanding of customers to maximize sales opportunities within
the existing and prospective customer base;

deliver the best customer experience. In an increasingly digital
world, excellent customer relations are vital for success and key to
sustainable performance. Orange Polska will continue to improve
the customer experience by offering attractive products and
services and improving customer services and both traditional and
online distribution channels. Orange Polska aims to become one
of the top two Polish operators based on the NPS (Net Promoter
Score), a measure of customer loyalty;

= improve business agility. Orange Polska will continue to streamline
its operations to become more agile, digital and flexible, through a
strong online presence, highly automated payment processing,
lower indirect costs and improved efficiency. The New Operating
Model project was launched with a view to streamlining and
automating processes, optimizing IT expenses, and facilitating
commercial initiatives, in particular in the convergence segment.

2016 will see this project implemented and will thus reflect the

plans to make massive investments to acquire high-speed fixed line
and mobile broadband customers after the network is deployed. The
results will be impacted by pressure on revenues and the commercial
campaign launched to gain market shares, while investments should
remain stable compared with 2015.

Overview of business

Fixed-line telephony market

The Belgian residential fixed-line telephony market continues to be
dominated by the oligopoly comprising incumbent operator Proximus.
and regional cable operators (Telenet, VOO, and Numericable). With
no actual competition, the market is not characterized by a fall in
prices, but primarily by elements such as the speed and premium TV
contents on offer. Furthermore, as they are able to access the mobile
network, fixed-line operators can offer convergence services, which
gives them a competitive advantage on mobile-only players in terms.
of customer acquisition and retention.

In 2011, Belgian regulators started a process to open the cable
operators’ network to alternative operators with a view to boosting
competition on the broadband and TV market. At the end of 2015,
the regulators’ conference (CRC) published a draft decision
concerning the revision of wholesale prices for accessing cable
networks, which was forwarded to the European Commission at the
beginning of 2016. Mobistar plans to launch its convergence offers in
2016 as soon as the CRC finally approves the cable wholesale pricing
system.

The fixed-line Enterprise segment is even more concentrated in terms.
of market shares. The incumbent operator has an extraordinarily
dominant position due to the failure of the liberalization of this market
segment, and thanks to their fixed-line and mobile convergence
strategy and an information system integration services offer. Mobistar
is the second player in this segment, with a 3000 Km fiber optic
network. Regional cable operators have limited presence in this
segment, but are trying to establish themselves on the SoHo (Small
Office Home Office) market.

Mobile telephony market

2015 was marked by the expansion of mobile data, accelerated by
the rollout of 4G and a higher smartphone penetration rate, which in

turn was boosted by a wider range of voice and data bundles offered
by operators. In addition, a growing share of the mobile market has
moved to convergence products.

According to regulator IBPT’s periodical price survey, Belgian
subscriptions are among the least expensive as far as the most
representative pricing plan goes, while overall average prices are in
line with those in neighboring European countries. A large part of
mobile customers in Belgium use prepaid cards, far more than their
counterparts in neighboring European countries. Belgian prepaid
prices are in line with the European average. The Belgian government
published a draft decree with a view to ending the anonymous use of
prepaid cards in Belgium in 2016.

The competitive environment

With three operators, the mobile market in 2015 was quite dynamic:
Mobistar, Proximus (incumbent operator) and BASE.

There is a strong market presence of virtual mobile network operators
of different sizes, the most prominent being cable operator Telenet.
Furthermore, while the minimal contract term is generally one or two
years in Europe, it is only six months in Belgium, a factor that boosts
competition. In 2015, operators focused on promoting convergence
offers, which have become the most important tool to acquire and
retain customers. Retail sale prices remain stable in the mobile market.

The fixed-line telephony market is largely dominated by the incumbent
operator, Proximus, and regional cable operators: Telenet (Flanders
and Brussels), Voo (Wallonia and Brussels) and Numéricable
(Brussels). In April 2015, the leading cable operator in Northern
Belgium, Telenet, announced plans to acquire BASE, the third largest
mobile operator, thereby strengthening its standing on the
convergence market.

Orange operates in Belgium through Mobistar, which is listed on the
Brussels Stock Exchange. The Orange group holds 52.9% of the
capital. At the end of 2015, Mobistar had 5.68 million customers in
Belgium including MVNOs, i.e. up 3.6% compared with the end of
2014. Excluding MVNOs, Mobistar had 3.89 million mobile
customers, compared with 3.92 million in 2014 (a fall of 0.6%). This
was due to an additional 40,700 subscriptions in a year and the
decline in the prepaid customer base (market downturn) and M2M
cards/loT (end of a significant contract), down by 44,600 customers
and 18,300 cards respectively. Mobistar’s subscription business is
performing well. The change in the business share of subscriptions

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

versus prepaid cards (73% vs. 27% at end-2015 compared with 71%
vs. 29% at end-2014) reflects the faster pace of net subscription
growth in the wake of improved termination and retention rates thanks
to greater customer-centric investment. Mobistar's total ARPU was
23.9 euros at end-2015, up 1.3% from 2014. Subscription ARPU was
up by 3.6% to 28.5 euros in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared
with 27.5 euros a year earlier. Customer interest in smartphones and
mobile data remains just as strong, with a 99% increase in the number
of 4G smartphone users in one year, accounting for almost 32% of
the mobile customer base. At the end of 2015, 4G traffic accounted
for over 62% of total mobile data traffic.

Mobistar’s offers

In 2015, Mobistar intensified its Have a Nice Day loyalty program.
Launched in 2014, it rewards customer loyalty with gifts. Mobistar
also provides access to the MyMobistar app to monitor personal
usage. In 2015, Mobistar continued to market its MySwap trade-in
offers (guaranteeing its customers the option to trade in their 4G
smartphones for up to 50% of the purchase price within 2 years). In
September, it launched the Buyback program, enabling customers to
take advantage of great value buyback offers for their used devices.
Since 2015, all smartphones sold by Mobistar are compatible with
mobile broadband. Lastly, since 2015, Mobistar offers free access to
the traffic information and road safety application iCoyote with
subscriptions starting at 20 euros. On the prepaid cards front, in May
2015 Mobistar launched a card with 4GB of traffic and 4000 SMS for
each 15 euro recharge. In October 2015, Mobistar launched Easy
Internet @home, a solution offering the benefits of fixed-line
broadband through Mobistar’s 4G mobile network, including 15GB
per month, at a monthly cost of 15 euros.

In the Enterprise segment, in 2015 Mobistar continued to pursue its
Entreprise Mobility 3.0 strategy to support business customers with
services and applications designed to help them transition to digital

technology. In 2015, Mobistar launched its Shape & Pulse
convergence offer for PMEs, built on Mobistar’s powerful 4G network
and reliable VDSL2 high speed broadband lines. The offer includes
different customization options, with a single point of contact and one
easy-to-read, streamlined invoice.

Distribution

In 2015, Mobistar continued to review its distribution strategy, which
led, in particular to:

= the internalization of employees across 35 points of sale located in
Carrefour hypermarkets in Belgium;

= the acquisition of Walcom, a business specializing in the sale of
personal telecommunications products and services through a
network of 20 stores and a dedicated business sales team;

= the expansion of in-store services, such as smartphone repairs,
insurance, mobile data training, buyback programs.

At the end of 2015, Mobistar had 151 outlets in Belgium. As part of
the transformation of its distribution network, Mobistar strengthened
and digitized direct channels to increase the number of visitors and
conversion rates and improve customer satisfaction.

From 2013 to 2015, Mobistar invested over 430 million euros in its
network and over 120 million euros to acquire 800 MHz frequency
bands. At the end of 2015, Mobistar's 4G network covered 99% of
the population outdoors (and 88% inside buildings). 4G+ technology
has been rolled out and is in its testing phase. It now covers more
than 21% of the population. This new technology offers users, who
have a compatible device, downloading speeds up to three times
faster than 4G. The commercial launch of 4G+ is planned for mid-
2016.

Mobistar has established a partnership with SOFICO to expand its
fiber optic network in southern Belgium. Sofico owns a fiber network
of over 2000 Km in length, which completes Mobistar’s 3000 Km fiber
network. This partnership will allow Mobistar to develop its network
in a more cost-effective way, and to accelerate the upgrade of its

broadband transmission network. Lastly, in 2015, Mobistar and its
subsidiary Orange Luxembourg launched a new service, offering
uninterrupted mobile communication to customers as they cross the
border between the two countries.

2016 Outlook

Two major events will involve Mobistar in 2016: the adoption of the
Orange brand in Belgium and the launch of attractive convergence
offers on all market segments. Mobistar wants to put forward a high-
quality offering that meets its customers’ needs, thereby ensuring a
gradual return to growth of revenues from services. Mobistar will also
continue the existing transformation projects which have already
generated material savings, in particular by focusing on digitizing its
processes and implementing a new ERP solution.

In 2015, the Romanian telecommunications market fell slightly, down
1% in value terms (source: Orange Romania), caused by the drop in
call termination rates and by the decline in the fixed voice segment.

The fixed broadband market — which has a low penetration rate
(65%) — continued to grow in volume. Pay TV also grew thanks to
richer content and multi-screen offers. The mobile telephony market
is in a recovery trend, thanks to the development of data services and
the increase in the consumer demand for abundance offers.

Overview of business

In 2015, all mobile operators continued to offer unlimited or
abundance offers at affordable prices, while focusing on monetizing
data and competing in the rollout of 4G. The migration from prepaid
services to contracts persisted, encouraged by subsidized
smartphone offers. The fixed-mobile convergence grew with two
convergent operators (Telekom and RCS&RDS), who benefited from
customer preferences for a single provider (twice as many as in 2014).

Vodafone became very aggressive in pricing and marketing
campaigns in order to win market share through regional offers
(prepaid and contracts). Telekom struggled to gain ground one year
after its new brand and its transformation process. RCS&RDS, which
acquired a 4G license and launched its service in 12 cities at end-
2015, was the main beneficiary of number portability, helping it to
increase its market share.

Due to the decrease in prepaid offers and aggressive pricing policies
from its competitors, Orange saw a slight decline in its share of the
mobile market in volume terms to 37%, but managed to protect its
market share in value terms.

Contract subscribers make up 46% of Orange Romania's total mobile
customer base (excluding M2M), representing 4.5 million, up
3 percentage points. This change is due to the development of 4G
services and the penetration of smartphones.

Orange included Internet access as well as international minutes for
calls to fixed and mobile networks in all its contract offers. This new
offering portfolio boosted the appetite for smartphones and tablets,
notably those compatible with 4G, and contributed to strong growth
in data services traffic and revenues. The product portfolio was
redesigned and simplified in September 2015 as part of a brand
change, and was structured around the offers Orange Me, Orange
Net, Orange Share, Orange Family and Business Open offers, with a
new loyalty program.

The Orange TV service surpassed 270 million subscribers and Orange
TV stick was launched in June 2015. The home automation solution
Smart Home was test launched in November 2015.

Regarding the corporate sector, the recovery trend was accompanied
by the launch of the Malima M2M platform in February 2015. Orange
has become the main supplier (Tier 1) of Microsoft solutions in
Romania, and has partnered with the automaker Dacia to equip a new
sport utility vehicle (SUV) model with onboard WiFi.

With 72% of the population and 96% of urban areas covered, Orange
offers the broadest 4G coverage in the country. This extensive
coverage enabled rapid adoption of smartphones and significant
growth of data traffic. The voice over LTE service (VoLTE) was
launched by Orange in 2015.

The implementation of the network sharing agreement with Vodafone
to improve 2G and 3G coverage is proceeding as planned, and 70%
of the program is already completed. As part of its strategic plan to
improve operational efficiency, in 2015, Orange implemented the
agreement signed with Ericsson in 2014 to outsource network

In 2015, the contraction of the telecommunication services market,
an ongoing trend for several years, continued (down 4.6% in 2015
after a 7.5% fall in 2014). The decline in traditional voice services
(mobile and fixed) was partly offset by increased data and television
services. Fixed-line Internet services grew 4.9% in volume and 1.4%

2016 Outlook

In 2016, Orange Slovensko expects its customer base to grow, with
the exception of prepaid cards, due to the negative impact of the
arrival of the new operator SWAN in the market. The objective is to
slow the ARPU erosion trend and to keep the annual churn rate below
6%. The Voice over Mobile LTE (VoLTE) service should be launched
in 2016.

Investments planned for 2016 will continue to focus on improving LTE
(4G) and LTE-A (4G+) quality and coverage in the country, as well as
on upgrading the network's capacity. The network modernization
program will continue (renovation of the radio access network, the all-IP
program, optical extensions in the core and access networks).

In 2015, Moldova's economy was negatively affected by several
factors:

the depreciation of the Moldovan currency against the euro and the
dollar and a high inflation rate (9.7%);

the decline of 16% in exports and of 33% of transfer of funds,
primarily due to the negative impact of the severe regional crisis in
Russia and Ukraine;

the continued political uncertainty that has blocked the reform
process and the planned aid from the IMF, the European Union,
and Western donors;

the contraction of the industrial and agricultural sectors, leading to
a global economic slowdown. The IMF expects Moldova’s GDP to
show a slight decline of 1% in 2015.

In 2015, Orange Moldova managed to protect the value of its
business by increasing revenue by 2.8 billion lei. Its attractive offers
for deferred payments on handset purchases allowed it to fully offset
the decline in revenue from the erosion of incoming international traffic
due to competition from Over-The-Top (OTT) providers and the impact
of the Russian crisis.

Commercial efforts have been focused on increasing value and on
customer loyalty, encouraging the migration of prepaid customers to
contracts and expanding the use of data and the M2M customer
base, in order to slow the decline in average revenue per user (ARPU).

Orange Moldova worked to improve the customer experience in 2015
through a specific program, and launched a new Orange brand
platform and opened its first Smart Store in Chisinau in October 2015.

Finally, Orange Moldova’s network was recognized as the best
network in the country in terms of performance and quality, with 4G
coverage having already reached 84% of the population.

2016 Outlook

Orange Moldova will focus its efforts in 2016 on consolidating its
leadership of the mobile market, continuing to develop data usage
and protecting the profitability of its business activities. The main
priorities will be to provide the best service to customers and ensure
the soundness of the company’s results through:

= the management of the customer base: slowing the decline in
ARPU, continuing the migration of prepaid customers to contracts,
speeding up the adoption of 4G smartphones and data use, and
encouraging the biggest users of 3G mobile broadband to move
to 4G;

= differentiation in the area of customer experience and loyalty
through the continuous improvement of customer interactions;

= maintaining its leadership in 4G by leveraging the increasing
adoption and use of mobile data.

The economic situation in Egypt improved in 2015 as a result of the
country’s return to political stability, the resumption of public
investments (extension of the Suez Canal), improved corporate
morale, the resumption of foreign investment following structural
reforms and the reduction of the public deficit. The Egypt's gross
domestic product (GDP) growth was an estimated 4.2% at end-2015,
2 percentage points higher than in 2014. The consolidation of the
economic recovery nevertheless remains dependent on the
continuation of the reforms already underway as the evolution of the
security situation.

In 2015, the regulatory authority (National Telecom Regulatory
Authority) imposed severe restrictions on the sale of lines for security
reasons, which resulted in a decrease in the number of mobile phones
in Egypt. The Egyptian mobile telephony market is comprised essentially
of prepaid customers. Operators are increasingly developing their
offers into the lower end of the market, reducing connection charges,

small amounts. This strategy is aimed to acquire middle-class and
rural customers, and has resulted in a reduction of the average
revenue per user (ARPU). The signs of recovery in the tourism industry
during the second half of 2014, confirmed at the start of 2015,
dissipated after the resurgence of terrorism in the 4th quarter, which,
in turn, had a serious effect on roaming revenues.

The penetration rate of fixed-line telephony continues to fall, the
development of broadband Internet remains very limited and the
mobile penetration rate fell for the first time in 2015, due to the decline
in the number of mobile handsets. This rate reached 112% of the
population at end-2015.

The competitive environment

Source: Orange Egypt.

The Egyptian market is characterized by an increasingly competitive
environment. Most competition is between mobile operators, but is
also moving increasingly into the Internet and B2B markets. At the
same time, OTT players are competing in the traditional
telecommunications sector.

ECMS was the first operator to launch mobile services in Egypt, which
it did in 1998 under the Mobinil brand. Vodafone Egypt was the
second operator to enter the market, also in 1998, under the
ClickKGSM brand. It has positioned itself in the high value-added
customer segment by virtue of its 3G network, launched in 2006.
Etisalat, a subsidiary of Etisalat U.A.E, entered the market in 2007 with
an aggressive low-cost strategy.

Despite the highly competitive market and regulatory pressure to
improve sales monitoring, Mobinil managed to increase customer
numbers in 2015 and maintain its number-two spot with a 33.2%
market share (source: GSMA February 2015). Vodafone remains the
market leader, with a share of 35.6%, and Etisalat is in 3rd place with
31.2%.

At the beginning of 2015, Orange bought all the shares and voting
rights of Mobinil (ECMS), increasing its stake in ECMS from 94% to
99%.

Mobinil’s mobile customer base stood at 33.1 million as of end-2015,
a fall of 2% compared with 2014, and 81% of customers are in the
prepaid segment. However, the proportion of prepaid customers
decreased in 2015 due to the success of capped contracts. Annual
revenues totaled 1,340 billion euros in 2015, an increase of 4.2%
compared with 2014 on a comparable basis.

Distribution

Mobinil sells products and services in Egypt through different
distribution channels:

52 Mobinil stores;

Network and licenses

ECMS has a GSM license and a 15-year UMTS-3G license obtained
in 2007. A coverage plan detailed over five years accompanies the
grant of the 3G license, and the Egyptian Telecommunication
Regulatory Authority (NTRA) guaranteed to Mobinil the grant of other
frequency bands, the possibility of applying a special rate to its
customers for communications within the Mobinil network (on net
mode), and the reservation of a new network code. Additional
spectrum was acquired in 2013.

2016 Outlook

The social and political situation has started to stabilize in Egypt.
However, the economic recovery has been slow and is threatened by
the difficulty in attracting foreign currencies as well as the impact of
terrorism on tourism and on direct investment from abroad. ECMS
will pursue the action plans initiated in 2012 with a strategy focused
on value creation and operational efficiency. ECMS's management will
continue to focus on cost-monitoring and profit margin improvements.
through major initiatives like a large transformation program. A
comprehensive license should be granted to the current mobile
operators in 2016. Telecom Egypt should secure a mobile license,
thereby becoming the 4th mobile operator on the market.

There are three operators in the mobile market: Orange, Tigo-Sentel
(a subsidiary of Millicom International) and Expresso Sénégal, a
subsidiary of Sudan Telecom (SUDATEL). Once again in 2015,
competition between the operators was fierce. It led to marketing
campaigns to encourage prepaid recharges for abundance offers
focused on voice off net uses and mobile data. The growth of mobile
Internet usage has continued, still boosted by improving service
quality, the expansion of 3G coverage, enriched offers and the
multiplication of smartphones. Orange was able to maintain its
market share compared to 2014, despite intense competition in 2015
(source: ARTP fourth quarter 2015).

The number of Orange mobile customers, almost entirely comprising
prepaid options increased by 3.9% in 2015 versus 9.9% in 2014. This
slowdown in the growth of the customer base is due on one hand to
regulatory constraints regarding the identification of customers
(extended in 2015 to the indirect sale of SIM cards), and to the near
saturation of the market, whose mobile penetration rate was 103.9%
in 2015, on the other.

The downward trend of ARPU continued in 2015 for several reasons:

= the decline in outgoing traffic revenues, strongly affected by the
development of abundance offers, partially offset by the growth of
mobile data revenues and value-added services;

= the increase in low revenue contribution subscriber categories.

However, this downward trend has slowed as a result of the growth
in mobile call termination revenue boosted by ultra abundant offerings
from the competition (calls to all networks), despite a further decrease
in mobile interconnection rates (from 15F to 12F).

The number of fixed broadband Internet (ADSL) subscribers fell slightly
(-4.4%) in 2015, due to the competition related to the development
of 3G mobile Internet offers. The total number of fixed lines remained
relatively stable compared to 2014 (-2.7%). This near-stabilization,
despite the strong competition in mobile activity, is related to the
development of new HOME fixed-line formulas offering the Livebox
with voice, Internet and TV contracts.

The mobile offer of Orange Senegal consists mainly of prepaid
formulas based on three types of offers: Diamono Classique, Diamono
S’ Cool and Diamono Door Waar. Furthermore, the Kiréne avec
Orange offer is an MVNO-type offer developed in partnership with
Kiréne. The Orange Money mobile payment offer had around
2.1 million registered customers at end-2015, representing 25% of
the mobile customer base. The expansion of the partnership with new
players in merchant payment and invoice payment led to significant
growth in the volume of transactions (+73%) compared with 2014.

The development of the mobile Internet offer is continuing with the
Pass Internet Everywhere sold by retailers from 100 CFA francs, with
more than 1.4 million users invoiced at the end of 2015.

Distribution
Orange's distribution network is made up of:

= one center bringing together the direct network's commercial
activities around 7 regional sales departments managing 37 directly
owned stores (Sonatel outlets), 11 of which are in Dakar;

= one agency dedicated to the development of sales by indirect
networks, which are made up of:

— 3 reserved sales areas (shop in shop) in Casino stores,
— 116 Orange stores,
— 60,360 indirect partners (wholesalers — semi-wholesalers — retail
vendors).
2016 Outlook
Orange Senegal's priorities in 2016 will be focused on:

= limiting the erosion in the EBITDA margin and stabilizing revenues
(excluding exceptional events) compared with 2015;

= keeping its market share (in volume and value), stabilizing its
prepaid recharges (in value) at least at the 2015 level and
overhauling its mobile and fixed-line subscription offers while
maintaining the same revenue;

implementing transformation projects;

= undertaking investment projects to renew and modernize its
networks, obtaining spectrum and successfully rolling out 4G, both
technically and commercially;

improving customer satisfaction (according to the COPC standard)
and controlling costs of the hotlines (technical and commercial) as
well as strengthening customer digitization solutions;

= developing Orange Money uses and services;

= developing synergies with the Group for international traffic (corridor
offers, OZ new look) and the positioning of HUB Data;

= consolidating its leading position in the mobile Internet market (with

Moov, and the expected allocation of a license to a fourth operator to
replace GreenN, Café Mobile and Comium. The allocation of licenses
for the launch of 4G is expected in early 2016.

The market is characterized by a high level of competition between
the operators, which offer very attractive price promotions (recharge
bonuses from 100% to 300%, and other freebies) and multiply the
number of promotions aimed at new customer recruitment and at
multiple ownership of SIM cards.

Within this context, Orange's market share increased in the third

Jordan launched an online sales service at the end of 2014.

2016 Outlook

Competition on the market is expected to remain intense in 2016,
when all operators will have a national 4G network. However, the
market is expected to focus more on abundance offers for data and
voice than on price reductions. The main drivers of growth will be the
Internet, fixed-line and especially mobile broadband. As a leader in
the Internet market, Orange Jordan is well positioned to benefit from
this development. The main objectives are to slow the decline of
traditional revenue by developing new revenue sources:

= developing network coverage and service quality to improve the
customer experience;

= transforming the customer base to higher revenue segments
(ARPU) through targeted offers;

= increasing the share of ICT revenues in the Enterprise segment.

3.1.6.5 Botswana

The mobile market is still developing, despite a high penetration rate
that reached 168% of the population in March 2015 (source: BOCRA
2015 annual report). The market is composed of four main players:
Botswana Telecommunications Corporation Limitel (BTCL), Mascom
Wireless Botswana (Mascom), Orange Botswana (Orange) and
Botswana Fibre Networks (BoFiNet), which provides wholesale
services.

In 2015, Orange cemented its number two ranking in the mobile
market, with almost 947,000 active customers at year-end (source:
Orange Botswana) and a market share of 32%, which remained
constant since 2014 (source: BOCRA 2015 annual report). 2015 also
saw the launch of new innovative services such as 4G.

On the fixed broadband market, a new operator, Konnecta, is
competing with BTCL.

Orange was the first mobile operator to launch 4G services in 2015.
Mobile voice and SMS represent 59% of its revenues, and data
services represent 19% of total revenues in 2015. Furthermore,
Orange continued to develop Orange Money and ranked number one
with a 65% market share of mobile payments (source: BOCRA 2015
annual report). The Orange mobile network covers nearly the entire
population of Botswana, including 53% for 3G services.

Orange has a distribution network of 17 stores around the country,
plus an indirect distribution network made up of retail chains and
wholesalers.

Orange Botswana's priorities for 2016 will be as follows:

= continued growth in the number of customers, fixed-line broadband
offers and revenues in the Enterprise segment;

= growth in mobile data usages and content;

= continued excellence in the customer experience.

3.1.6.6 Cameroon

The mobile market has a penetration rate of 93%, compared to 72%
in 2014 (source: GSMA). This change reflects in particular the
development of the multi-SIM phenomenon, following the arrival of a
third GSM operator at the end of 2014 and the expansion of
geographic coverage by the operators.

In 2015, the competition mainly focused on data formulas, through
an accelerating rollout of mobile coverage, the enrichment of the offers
and the development of promotions and bonuses, as well as price
cuts.

Orange Cameroun had 7.1 million active customers at the end of
2015, more than 98% of them prepaid customers, up sharply
compared with 2014 (+14%).

For Orange Cameroun, 2015 was marked by the renewal of its
operating license for a duration of 15 years, allowing it to offer 3G and
4G services. In March 2015, Orange Cameroun launched its 3G
network, relying on its broad network coverage (more than 50% of
sites). Revenue from the data business continued to grow in the wake
of this launch, reaching about 7% of total revenue at the end of 2015
(versus 3% in 2014). Furthermore, Orange Cameroun consolidated
its leading position in mobile payments thanks to the numerous
innovations of its Orange Money service.

In 2016, the competitive environment is expected to expand, with the
expected launch by the incumbent operator CAMTEL of its GSM
network, bringing the number of GSM operators in the market to four.

= covering 90% of the population set by the specification thanks to
the deployment of 30 new sites;

= the development of mobile revenue through a better marketing
presence, convergent and innovative offers;

= the development of the mobile data and B2B markets by proposing
competitive and innovative offers.

3.1.6.8 Guinea Conakry

Orange Guinea, the fourth company to join the telecommunications
market in 2007, has been a driving force in its development and has
consolidated since 2013 its leading position with a market share of
54.4% and more than 5.3 million customers at the end of 2015. Voice
traffic still dominates mobile usage, but mobile Internet is growing.
Orange covers the 33 prefecture capitals with 3G broadband Internet
(launched in 2011) and is the only operator to cover all 304 sub-
prefecture capitals with 2G. The development of mobile Internet has
been possible thanks to the transmission capabilities of the
connection to the ACE submarine cable. Orange Guinea is also
pursuing the development of its mobile business through Orange
Money, distributed through a network of 301 kiosks to more than
135,000 active customers at the end of 2015. Orange Guinea
distributes its products through a direct network of 17 agencies and
an indirect network made up of 185 stores. Orange is the only
operator in Guinea Conakry that is ISO 9001-2008 certified and has
received the Top Employer 2005 distinction in Guinea and in Africa.

3.1.6.9 Mauritius

Mauritius Telecom — Orange is the leading fixed-line (ahead of DCL)
and mobile (ahead of Emtel and MTML) operator in Mauritius (source:
GSMA). It offers a comprehensive range of voice and fixed, mobile
and Internet data services, together with convergence packages
(voice, IP and TV) through MyT. In 2012, Orange was the first operator
to launch 4G and the Orange Money mobile payment service and
launched its fiber optic network (FTTH) in 2013 with a flow rate of 10-
30 Mbits/s.

The number of customers increased for all Internet (+8.0% or 183,000
broadband Internet customers), mobile (+7.2% or 892,000 customers)
and fixed-line (+0.9% or 365,000 customers) segments in 2015
(source: Mauritius Telecom). This growth strengthened Mauritius
Telecom — Orange's leadership position in the market. The Group
enhanced its TV selection and took over the leadership in pay TV with
more than 119,000 customers (+18.4%). Moreover, Orange offers
Cloud solutions to companies.

The company delivers global connectivity via the Sat3/WASC/SAFE,
LION and LION2, Eassy, and GIE fiber optic submarine cables. The
Group also has a presence abroad through its investments in Orange
Madagascar, CSL Madagascar, and its stake in TVL, the incumbent
operator in Vanuatu, which was increased from 50% in 2013 to 100%
in 2015.

3.1.6.10 Iraq

lraq had a population of 35.2 million people (source: IMF,
October 2016). In the third quarter of 2015, the number of customers.
reached 30.6 million, a mobile penetration rate of 83% (source:
GSMA, December 2015). In 2011, the Orange group acquired a
minority 20% stake in the Iraqi operator, Korek Telecom, which holds
the national 2G and 3G mobile licenses. The economic conditions
changed drastically from June 2014 with the start of the civil war in
the northern and eastern parts of the country, with security problems.
affecting the expenditure and consumption of Iraqi citizens. However,
the company continued to expand throughout the country, extending
network and sales coverage, and in December 2015 it reached
7.2 million customers (vs. 6.3 million in December 2014).

3.1.6.11 Kenya

In November 2015, Orange signed a binding agreement with Helios
Investment Partners for the disposal of its entire equity investment of
70% in Telkom Kenya. The completion of this transaction remains
subject to the approval of the relevant authorities.

3.1.6.12 Madagascar

Madagascar's political stability was confirmed in 2015 with the
municipal elections that were held in July. However, in the absence of
significant progress in governance and fiscal reforms, only a few
hundred million dollars in financial aid have been paid out.

At the end of 2015, the mobile penetration rate as around 22%. The
number of Orange's mobile customers and its market share remained
stable. Orange strengthened its leading position in the 3G and 3G+
broadband mobile Internet market, notably for businesses, thanks to
the quality of the international connectivity provided by the LION cable.

On the consumer market, Orange continued in 2015 its commercial
strategy based on prepaid Internet contracts at very competitive
prices, combined with a smartphone offer at less than 50 euros.

In the area of Corporate Social Responsibility, Orange Madagascar
continued to install solar panels in rural regions to help reduce CO,
emissions related to the generation of electricity for its radio sites. At
the end of 2015, 250 radio sites were powered directly by solar
energy, out of a total of 630 sites.

Awaiting for its license renewal, Orange postponed in 2016 the launch
of its 4G service in order to be able to offer a better experience to its
customers.

Finally, Orange Money continued to grow in 2015, increasing its active
customer base by more than 30%, which generated almost
50 million euros in transactions in December 2015, up 35% compared
with 2014, at constant exchange rates (source: Orange). The Orange
Money distribution network also expanded, with more than 3,000
deposit-withdrawal points in 2015.

Orange's priorities in 2016 will be:

= developing telecommunication services aimed at businesses and
professionals, notably with the launch of its 4G service;

= the continued development of Orange Money;

Overview of the group’s business

= the improvement of its mobile network in high-demand areas;

= the strengthening of the broadband transmission network.

3.1.6.13 Mali

The mobile market slowed in 2015 to reach a market penetration rate
of 126%, down 9 percentage points compared to 2014 (source:
Orange Mali estimates), due to the launch of subscriber identification.

Orange, the second company to join the mobile market, is now the
leader in the mobile market with a 57.9% market share (source:
Orange Mali estimates). Orange’s main competitor is Sotelma, the
incumbent operator, owned by Maroc Télécom, which itself is held by
Etisalat. The government granted a third comprehensive license to
the Planor-Monaco Telecom International consortium in January 2013;
the consortium will operate through the Malian company Alpha
Télécommunication Mali SA (Atel-SA).

At end-2015, Orange Malis mobile network covered about 89% of
the population and 44% of the country, and had a total of 11.9 million
active customers, 99.9% of them prepaid customers. The main
mobile usage is voice, mobile broadband and mobile payment
systems. In June 2010, Orange Mali launched the Orange Money
service, which allows users to carry out financial transactions from
their mobile phones. The service had nearly 3.4 million customers at
the end of 2015 (versus 2.3 million at end-2014).

The broadband Internet customer base included more than 165,500
subscribers at end-2015, an increase of more than 18%.

In 2016, the main challenges for Orange Mali will be as follows:

= being the customer experience leader to then become the preferred
operator in Mali;

= keeping its position as market leader in terms of volume and value;

= turning Orange Money into a financial success following on from its
commercial success.

3.1.6.14 Morocco

In 2015, the telecommunications market in Morocco was marked by
asignificant drop of 16% in average prices for mobile services, which
led to a 10% increase in average usage volume per customer (source:
ANRT, 4th quarter of 2015). The main mobile usage remains voice,
due to the significant decline in SMS caused by the development of
OTT services. On the other hand, 2015 confirmed the market dynamic
for data and value-added services, which continued to show strong
growth.

Orange is present in the market through its subsidiary Médi Telecom,
which markets its services under the Méditel brand. Orange increased
its stake in Médi Telecom in July 2015 and now holds 49% of the
shares and a majority of the seats on the Board of Directors.

Médi Telecom had a 31.9% share of the mobile market, or 1.2 percentage
points more than in 2014, with 13.7 million mobile customers at end-
December 2015 (source: ANRT), and covered 99% of the population.
Maroc Telecom is the market leader with 18.3 million customers
(42.5% market share), and Inwi is in third position with 11.0 million
mobile customers. The mobile customer base is mainly made up of
prepaid customers (94%).

Médi Telecom has a strong presence in the mobile Internet market
with 3.69 million customers at end-December 2015 and 27.7% of the
market share (source: ANRT). 3G/4G mobile Internet is the dominant
Internet access mode in Morocco, accounting for 92% of the total
Internet market at end-December 2015 (source: ANRT).

Médi Telecom has 420 stores and more than 50,000 resellers
throughout the country to distribute its products and services.

Highlights for Médi Telecom in 2015 were:

obtaining a 4G license and being the first operator to launch 4G
services in Morocco in April, with a coverage rate of 35% of the
population at end-2015;

revitalizing the contract market in May by launching unlimited voice
and SMS offers beginning at 199 dirhams (or 18.5 euros) per month
with 3 Gb of data;

launching its consumer ADSL services in October following the
ANRT decisions on the rates and technical methods for unbundling
the local loop and Morocco Telecom's publication of related
wholesale offers;

signing a long-term loan for 3.2 billion dirhams with a consortium
of Moroccan banks in December. This new funding will allow the
operator to continue to invest in broadband service, and in its
strategies for digitization and customer-focused service offerings;

at end-2015, having almost completed the renewal of its radio
access network and its backhaul and IP capacities.

In 2016, Médi Telecom will focus on:

speeding up the development of mobile data business thanks to a
completely updated network;

regionalizing the distribution and the development of digital
distribution to get closer to the end-customer;

developing ADSL and fiber offers, as well as the Enterprise market,
supported by its ability to propose fixed-line broadband offers via
adapted fiber and radio access.

3.1.6.15 Niger

Orange, the most recent entrant in the mobile market, has a market
share of 35%, and ranks second behind Airtel and ahead of Moov
and Sahelcom (source: GSMA January 2016). Its mobile customer
base included 1.9 million active customers (Source: Orange). Orange
Niger is the market leader in mobile broadband Internet thanks to its
exclusive 3G offer. Orange Niger also ranks second behind Airtel for
the coverage of its mobile network, with coverage of 80% of the
population in 2015 and a network of over 515 2G sites and 151 3G
sites (source: Orange Niger).

Orange Niger markets its products through a direct distribution
network made up of 11 stores, supplemented by 45 distributors and
22,000 points of sale located throughout the country.

In 2016, Orange Niger aims to remain the country’s leading ISP. It also
aims to consolidate its position in the mobile market by reinforcing its
network in the country’s major cities and continuing to improve quality
of service.

3.1.6.16 Central African Republic

Orange, the last of four mobile operators to enter the Central African
Republic market, quickly set to work to conquer the B2B market.

Its customer base is more than 395,000 active customers, almost all
of whom are prepaid customers. As the first operator to have
launched 3G in the Central African Republic, followed by Telecel,
Orange is the market leader in mobile broadband Internet (in 3G and
in WiMAX).

Orange Centrafrique had a direct distribution network comprising
4 branches (2 in Bangui, 1 in Berberati and 1 in Bouar, the branch in
Bambari was temporarily closed for safety reasons), in addition to
30 distributors and 7,200 resellers across the country.

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

The growth of the telecommunications market is still heavily
handicapped by low purchasing power (compounded by high
inflation, particularly for food products) and the lack of infrastructure,
as well as repercussions of the troubles experienced by the country
since 2013. The mobile penetration rate remains low, due to the very
low population density, which limits network coverage (according to
the IMF, the population was 4.8 million in 2015, i.e. fewer than
8 inhabitants per km?).

Nevertheless, Orange Centrafrique continues to invest in the mobile
network to enhance its coverage and quality of service. It has the
second most extensive network in the country, with 106 sites (63 sites
in 2G only and 43 sites in 2G/3G), allowing it to offer mobile services
in 51 towns.

Pour 2016, Orange Centrafrique aims to confirm its leadership in
mobile data and fixed data, strengthen its position among B2B
customers (military, NGOs and companies) by providing customers
with the best possible experience and to be a pioneer in mobile
banking.

3.1.6.17 Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has a population of
81.7 million, putting it in fourth place in Africa in terms of population
(source: IMF, October 2015). However, the mobile penetration rate is
only 58% (source: GSMA February 2015), much lower than in most
neighboring countries.

Orange owns 100% of Orange RDC, holds a national 2G and 3G
license, and boasts excellent growth potential due to the country's
low mobile penetration rate.

The number of Orange RDC mobile customers was 5.3 million at the
end of 2015, compared with 4.3 million at the end of 2014, an
increase of 23% (source: Orange RDC).

In 2015, Orange RDC achieved revenue growth of 42%. This growth
is related to the commercial success of its prepaid contract offers,
Bilengi, and its data offers. Orange RDC finalized its new organization
in 2015, with the establishment of six regional divisions primarily
dedicated to customers.

In 2016, Orange RDC aims to achieve revenue growth of approximately
30%, in addition to a 46% increase in its customer base. To that end,
Orange will focus on the following areas of development in 2016:

= accelerating 3G+ network coverage to strengthen the growth in
data traffic, with the coverage of a 2nd major city (Kisangani) after
Mbuji-Mayi in 2015;

improving the technical quality of service and customer satisfaction
(ACE program);

improving the capillarity of the distribution and the densification of
the outlets network by the regionalization of the sales activity;

maintaining and strengthening marketing, focused on the quality
and generosity of the offers;

developing new sources of growth and opportunities concerning:

— rural telephony: increasing network coverage in rural areas (70%
of the Congolese population) with the support of technical partners,
through a very ambitious program for at least 500 villages,

— developing high speed broadband offers for large companies
and flexible voice offers for small companies,

— Orange Money, with the launch of the Mobile Banking service,
relying on the distribution and the quality of the service,

— wholesale traffic, by developing hubbing activities for international
traffic.

3.1.6.18 Tunisia

In 2015, Orange Tunisie continued its growth dynamic started in 2014
and became a recognized operator in the telecommunications market
with 4 million mobile customers (an increase of 640,000 compared to
2014). Its mobile market share also increased to 23% versus 42.5%
for Ooredoo and 34.5% for Tunisie Telecom at the end of
October 2015 (source: INTT).

Its share of the mobile Internet market increased to 46%, versus
31.4% for Tunisie Telecom and 22.6% for Ooredoo at the end of
October 2015 (source: INTT). After five years of operation, Orange
Tunisie generated positive net income for the first time.

During 2015, Orange Tunisie launched several prepaid mobile offers:

launch and 16 times the amount since October 2015;

= 20/20, which offers its subscribers a bonus equal to 20 times the
recharge;

= Edawa8s, which offers a low price-per-minute;
= and a variety of voice, SMS and data options.

At the end of December 2015, the ARPU (at 9.88 dinars) was
increasing by 10% compared to 2014 and the churn rate was
improving.

Orange Tunisie also revised its Flybox fixed-line and Internet offers,
which are more generous in terms of voice and data, and extended
its value-added services (SOS Data Credit, anew range of SOS Voice
Credit, the Bye Bye service).

Moreover, Orange Tunisie has expanded its distribution network with
nearly 24 directly-owned stores, 38 franchises including special areas
for professional customers, 116 points of sale that have been awarded
labels and more than 15,000 recharging outlets. This rollout has
allowed Orange Tunisie to strengthen and consolidate its marketing
strategy and to get closer to its customers.

Overview of the group’s business
Overview of business

The improvement of the customer experience remains Orange
Tunisie’s top priority, and is based in particular on the Excellence in
Customer Service program, the continued improvement of customer
interactions (digitization, immediate surveys) and the opening of the
first Smart Store in December 2015.

As regards technical developments, 2015 saw the continuation of the
plan for extending and consolidating the network, with the commissioning
of 137 new radio sites, bringing the total number of optimized radio
sites to 1,463 in 2015, thereby reducing the gap between Orange
Tunisie and its two other competitors.

2015 was also significant for several major developments in the core
network's architectures and service platforms:

= capacity extensions of the existing sites and extension of the core
network in order to reach a capacity of 21.5 Gb of traffic at end-2015;

= continuing the Enterprise connectivity plan;

= continuing the fiber optic plan, connecting about a hundred sites
with fiber in 2015, including 40 for LTE use.

At the level of society, Orange Tunisie’s policy is part of the Orange
Group's global policy, focused on the company’s social responsibility,
as well a policy of sponsorship and support of regions through the
financing of projects such as the granting of digital tablets to the Bardo
museum and the rehabilitation of schools in deprived areas, making
the digital world accessible to the greatest number of people.

As part of the preparations for launching 4G in Tunisia in 2016, Orange
Tunisie moved forward with the commissioning of 33 4G sites as part
of the Orange City project.

In 2016, Orange Tunisia will pursue its growth strategy focused on
developing data services through the launch of 4G, the launch of more
innovative services in order to meet the needs of high-value customers.
and an investment plan to support growth.

Orange Business Services offers a range of services to large corporate
customers, local authorities and SMEs in France, as well as to
multinationals around the world, supporting their digital transformation
and the implementation of their communication projects. To achieve
this, and thereby become the trusted partner in the digital
transformation of its customers, Orange Business Services offers a
full range of services, primarily in the fixed-line communications and
IT services markets.

Worldwide, the contraction in fixed-line connectivity services (voice
and data), on one hand, and the sharp increase in IT services, on the
other hand, led to overall market growth of 2.3%, at constant
exchange rates, in 2015:

they previously held 50/50. This agreement was approved by the
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK in January 2016.

= the connectivity market continued to contract in 2015, dipping
below -2%, at constant exchange rates. The decline in the legacy
voice and data markets was only slightly offset by higher demand
for IPVPN networks and broadband and high-capacity broadband
networks, particularly Ethernet;

= the IT services market grew by over 3.6%, once again at constant
exchange rates, thanks to the various consulting, integration,
outsourcing and product support services.

In France, the market continued to grow in 2015 at a rate of close to
1%. The ongoing decline in the fixed-line voice market together with
the erosion of the fixed-line data market, were largely offset by the
growth in the IT services market:

= the enterprise network services market continued to decline, by
around 3.5% in 2015. The fixed-line voice market continued to
contract, due to the lower number of accesses, the erosion of
prices, technological migration (SIP) and substitution by other methods.
of communication (mobile telephony, unified communications,
email, OTT services (Over-The-Top), etc.). The data market continued
to fall: growth in the broadband and high-capacity broadband
markets did not offset the sharp downward trend in the legacy
services market, along with the slight decline in the IPVPN networks.
market;

= the IT services market built on the recovery that began last year,
growing by over 1.5% in 2015. This growth, which was continually
revised upwards during the year by analysts and industry associations
such as Syntec Numérique, reflects the improvement in the consulting,
integration and outsourcing services market, support services being
relatively stable.

In terms of the business market, the major trends are as follows:

= the boundaries between telecommunications operators and
integrators are blurring due to the commoditization of networks and
the convergence towards IP: operators are offering advanced
communication services that are increasingly integrated into
businesses’ information systems, and are entering into direct
competition with IP integrators and Internet companies. At the
same time, Internet companies are enhancing their services with
network solutions to take advantage of the rise in new usages such
as Cloud Computing;

= confronted with new mobility-related usages within businesses (like
BYOD, or Bring Your Own Device), both operators and integrators
are updating their services line-up to meet customers’ needs for
administration, data security, applications, and value-added services;

regional expansion is another growth driver in emerging countries
(BT's Prosperity Plan for Asia and Latin America, Telefonica’s
significant expansion particularly in Brazil, Vodafone's substantial
investments in America, Asia and Africa);

lastly, companies may turn to acquisitions and partnerships to
speed up their transition to new economic models, whether via
acquisitions or partnerships.

challenges for its customers:

= the need for good connectivity at the right time, whether fixed or
mobile;

evolving towards more mobile and effective working methods
based on unified communication and collaboration solutions or the
popularity of smartphones and tablets in the corporate world;

= the need for more flexible IT infrastructures, thanks to virtualization
technologies and IT services provided upon request (as a Service);

= the use of the Internet of Things, data analytics and multi-channel
contact centers to improve business performance.

particularly close eye to the native security of its customers’ data and
information systems, while providing the best quality of service and
customer experience in the market.

Distribution, operations and partnerships

The market comprising professionals, small companies and SMEs is
managed by a country-wide commercial branch network which, via
sales personnel dedicated to a portfolio of customers and/or
telephone advisers, promotes and sells solutions, updates customers.
on the status of their orders, and endeavors to provide top-quality
service.

In the large corporate accounts market, Orange Business Services
canvasses, advises and supports its customers by providing a range
of solutions and expertise to assist them in their development in
France and worldwide. Dedicated sales teams work in close
collaboration with customers in pre-sales, during the sales process
and after-sales, to ensure Orange Business Services represents a
reliable partner in their digital transformation. They also promote
partnership-based approaches. Lastly, companies can manage their
contracts and place orders in real time using the Orange website.

Orange Business Services also relies on international partners to
supplement its offer and geographical coverage in areas where its
customers operate and where its presence does not offer a
comprehensive solution. Orange Business Services is working to build
this type of partnership in the most developed markets, preferably
with the leading operator or its direct competitor, like NTT
Communications in Japan or AT&T in the United States.

The Customer Service & Operations Division (CSO) is responsible for
the production and maintenance of solutions worldwide. Backed by
its geographical reach, the CSO supports customers in managing the
rollout of their network and IT projects and in the daily operation of
their services, including on-site call-outs. In some countries, CSO uses
local partners for local rollouts and to supply equipment. CSO
structures its operations using standardized processes and tools in
order to monitor and support its customers round the clock: two.
Customer Service Units (CSU) for French customers, and five Major
Service Centers (MSC) located in India, Egypt, Brazil, Mauritius and
France serving international customers. This system, together with
network redundancy, ensures service continuity for customers,
especially in the case of exceptional events (natural disasters, political
events, or a problem with submarine cables).

3.1.9

3.1.9.1 International Carriers
The market

The global international voice market was estimated at 569 billion
minutes in 2014. Its growth is being driven by the economic
development of areas with high geographical density (South-East
Asia, China and India) as well as the development of mobile telephony
(in particular in Africa), and the development of VoIP.

The wholesale of voice and data traffic as well as the provision of
transmission means accounted for approximately 65% of the global
international voice market in 2013 and was estimated at 354 billion
minutes (source: Telegeography 2015).

There were over 1,140 operators in the mobile market in 237 countries
(source: GSM Association), including 480 commercially operating
4G/LTE networks in 157 countries (source: GSA January 2016).

Overview of the group’s business
Overview of business

Orange Business Services works in close cooperation and bilaterally
with major technology players, such as Cisco, Microsoft, Alcatel-
Lucent, EMC, Avaya, Juniper, Polycom, Netapp, VMWare and
Genesys, or with members of the mobile industry, such as Samsung,
Apple and Blackberry. Orange Business Services also forms partnerships
with service companies, such as Akamai, GFI or Accenture, to

International Carriers & Shared Services

The competitive environment

Wholesale operators can be divided into three types — global wholesalers,
multinational retail operators and regional or specialist players:

= global wholesalers have the critical mass needed to obtain the most
competitive rates and to pass them on to their customers: TATA,
BICS and iBasis are the main global wholesalers;

= multinational retail operators aim to optimize their end-customers'
traffic and generate revenues and earnings in addition to those from
their retail traffic. Orange, Vodafone, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom
and Telia Sonera are among the main ones;

lastly, regional and specialist players that focus on a particular
geographical area or offer voice or data services, for which they
generally offer competitive rates. These primarily include Interoute,
Primus, Citic, and Calltrade.

The wholesale market's customer base comprises voice market
specialists (call-shop, prepaid cards), domestic retail carriers (including
MVNOs), and Internet service providers. International carriers also sell
wholesale traffic to each other.

3.1.9.2 Shared Services

Orange continues to develop new growth activities, related to its core
business line, that add value, in the fields of content distribution,
audience monetization and health.

Content rights

Orange's content strategy is primarily based on developing partnerships
with rights holders and service publishers. Orange is mainly focused
on its role of aggregating and distributing content to offer improved
services to its customers.

The Group is developing new services in France for its customers with
a focus on multi-screen usage, interactivity and on-demand programs.
In 2014, Orange launched its Polaris project, which offers a new
interface and unified services on all screens, in a clear and intuitive
universe. It was rolled out on TV decoders from November 2014
and was broadly complete across all ADSL and fiber TV decoders at
end-2015.

This strategy is also deployed in other European countries such as
Poland, Spain, Romania, Belgium, Slovakia and in the MEA area in
Mauritius, Senegal and Ivory Coast.

In the publishing sphere, Orange is focusing on video on demand
(VOD). In France, since 2014 the service has offered, in addition to
VOD rental, permanent video download program functionality (EST).
Orange is the only French player to have signed agreements with all
US studios and can thus offer EST early video releases provided by
the studios.

Orange also continues to develop its OCS (Orange Cinema Series)
premium service, which is available on TV and on demand across all
screens and available from most distributors in France.

For music, Orange continues to innovate in the music streaming
segment, in partnership with Deezer since 2010 and through the roll-
out of its Orange Radio service. The year 2014 saw significant growth
in the number of Deezer subscribers and users. The Deezer music
streaming service is now available in four European countries (France,
United Kingdom, Romania and Spain) and in two African countries
(Mauritius and Ivory Coast) and the Deezer Family offer exclusively
with Orange was launched in France in 2015. The Orange Radio
service has been rolled out in seven Group countries, including in
France on Orange's boxTV.

In the highly innovative gaming sector, Orange plays the critical role
of technical, communication and distribution partner for the leading
publishers (Activision, EA, Ubisoft, Disney, Gameloft, Focus), across
all screens. Listening closely to its customers, Orange develops
differentiated and tailored offers: on mobile with the success of the
unlimited contract and Freemium games in Europe and with sustained
growth in Africa; on PC with quality, easy-access games; on TV
streaming for all players in the family. Over 200 games are now
available on an unlimited basis as part of the Pass Famille offer. New
publishers are signing up to the catalog with games like Skylanders,
Sonic and Rayman. The improved video quality and the expanded
range of game controllers (Gamer, mobile app) create an incomparable
gameplay experience. For the fourth year running, Orange presented
these innovations at Paris Games Week and also signed partnerships
in the field of eSport. In sports, the Group bought rights where necessary,
such as in Spain: Orange Espagne thus launched a TV service for
football, after having expanded its TV programming with La Liga, Copa
del Rey and Champions League rights for the 2015/2016 season.

Lastly, the content services helped to promote 4G offers and value-
added Internet access offers.

Viaccess Orca

Viaccess Orca, a subsidiary of Orange, designs and markets
innovative solutions for distributors of digital content (pay TV, video on
demand) enabling them to monetize premium content and the user
experience in a multi-network and multi-screen environment. Its
portfolio includes the protection of content rights, service platforms,
and user commitment management solutions (introductory and
recommended content solutions).

Health

An aging population, an increase in the number of people losing their
independence and the number of patients suffering from chronic
illnesses, coupled with a decrease in the number of doctors and

Overview of the group’s business
Network and real estate

medical desertification in rural areas make it all the more necessary
for health professionals to turn to information and communication
technologies. They help increase the efficiency of health professionals,
reduce costs, improve illness management and strengthen the
relationship between doctor and patient. Digital services also provide
secure data access and transmission. Orange was the first
telecommunications operator in France to be approved as a personal
health data host.

Orange Healthcare, the Healthcare Division of Orange Business
Services, draws on its know-how to develop its services, primarily in
France, in five strategic areas, by:

= facilitating the care pathway through the Connected Hospital,
Flexible Healthcare Computing and Shared Medical Imaging systems,
that allow hospitals, clinics and doctors’ offices to share vital patient
information. Thanks to these services, healthcare establishments
can better coordinate their activities, collaborate more efficiently,
and transfer data seamlessly;

supporting the digital transformation of healthcare industries (Pharma,
MedTech), through for example the tele-monitoring of patients with
diabetes or through tele-observation to treat patients suffering from
nocturnal respiratory disorders, with the Connected Health Center
solution;

hosting and adding value to healthcare data (Healthcare Big Data)
by working with all healthcare professionals to use the data while
ensuring confidentiality, in particular in connection with a think tank
dedicated to healthcare big data, the Healthcare Data Institute;

reducing the resort to the healthcare system by improving prevention,
via permanently accessible IT tools;

go along with the population ageing in the Silver Economy sphere
through pilot home care projects in regions that have partnered with
mutual or other insurance companies.

3.2 Network and real estate

3.2.1. Network

3.2.1.1

At the end of 2015, Orange operated networks in almost 30 countries
to serve its customers in the consumer market and in approximately
200 countries or territories to serve its business customers. These
networks enable Orange to provide its customers with ever greater
and enhanced connectivity wherever it operates.

Overview

In order to provide this enhanced connectivity, investment in networks
is designed to improve the Orange networks in a number of respects:

= development of high-speed broadband, increased data transfer
volumes and reduced connection latency;

= implementation of the program to switch all services over to the IP
infrastructure (“all IP" program);

= preparation of the gradual visualization of network control functions
(“programmability”);

automation of network operation and implementation of
mechanisms to personalize the quality of service provided to each
customer in line with his or her expectations.

The network architecture is broken down into:

= access networks (fixed or mobile);

= national and international transmission networks;
= IP transport networks;

= service control networks.

3.2.1.2 Fixed access networks
Analog access and ADSL broadband access

Orange is a copper access network operator in France, Poland and
various countries in Africa (Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mauritius and
Jordan).

Analog voice access services are provided to more than 10 million
customers in these countries.

Broadband ADSL access (for voice applications, Internet access and
television) is available:

= in France and in Poland with cover approaching 100% on the
incumbent local loop;

= in MEA countries where Orange is the operator on the copper local
loop;

= in other countries (for example Egypt, Spain and Slovakia), using
the local loop of the incumbent operators, whether unbundled or
via bitstream-type offers.

FTTH very high broadband access

FTTH fiber optic access can extend the available broadband ADSL
service offer to include upstream and downstream high-capacity
bandwidth (of 100 Mbits/s and more), with improved response time.

In France, Orange has for several years been deploying point-to-
multipoint FTTH architecture that uses GPON technology, which can
pool several very high broadband accesses on a single fiber without
affecting each access point's capacity for increasing speed.

FTTH roll-out started in 2007 in several major French cities (Paris and
the Hauts-de-Seine, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Poitiers, Toulouse). It was
then expanded to other large cities. During the years 2011 and 2012,
Orange entered into sharing arrangements with other telecoms
operators to speed fiber optic rollout. At end-2015, Orange's fiber had
been rolled out to all regions of metropolitan France covering
73 departments and 530 municipalities including close to
400 municipalities in lower density areas, bringing connectivity to
almost 5.1 million households.

In Spain, following the integration of Jazztel, the FTTH network offered
connectivity to over 6.8 million households. A FTTH fiber network was,
also rolled out in Slovakia, with connectivity offered to over 342,000
households at end-2015. The FTTH roll-out also began in Poland,
with connectivity offered to over 717,000 households at end-2015.

Fixed Radio Access

In a number of different countries, fixed-line services are available
through UMTS, Wimax (Romania and Africa), and CDMA (Poland and
Senegal) radio access.

3.2.1.3 Broadband mobile access networks

The GSM (2G), UMTS (3G) and LTE (4G) access networks support
faster data and voice communication services of up to several Mbits/s
that can be used to send and receive large files (audio, photo and
video).

2015 was marked by:

= the continued roll-out of 4G/4G+ networks in Europe, by increasing
the coverage of the population and speeds in countries where this
service has already been launched. For example, in autumn 2015
Orange Espagne launched LTE-Advanced, offering speeds of up
to 336 Mbits/s;

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

= the first 4G network roll-outs in the MEA area, in Jordan, Morocco,
Botswana and Mauritius;

= the start of the roll-out of a radio network for the Internet of Things,
using the LoRa (Long Range) technology, in 17 urban areas in
France.

3.2.1.4 Transmission networks
Domestic Networks

This infrastructure is primarily made up of fiber optic, but it also
contains microwave links, especially for alternative or purely mobile
networks in MEA countries.

Optical links offer a bandwidth of up to 100 Gbits/s per wavelength,
and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing technology (DWDM)
makes it possible to have 80 wavelengths per fiber. Orange is one of
the world leaders in the use of advanced optical functions in order to
have a more flexible transmission network. For example, the first of
its kind worldwide, it deployed a 400 Gbits/s per wavelength optical
link between Paris and Lyon in 2013.

Furthermore, Orange offers direct connections by fiber optic to
business customers, providing them with very high bandwidth services.

WidE Long-distance Domestic Optical Network
(WELDON) in France

Rollout of the WELDON network (WidE Long distance Domestic
Optical Network) began in April 2012 and aims to upgrade the entire
existing long-distance network, while extending its scope to serve
Frankfurt, London, Barcelona and Madrid, submarine cable stations,
and other areas neighboring France as needed in future.

WELDON uses the latest WDM technology and offers enhanced
connectivity at speeds of at least 100 Gbits/s per wavelength and up
to 88 wavelengths per cable.

International Transmission Network

This international network is based on two networks connected to the
WELDON network: the North-American backbone served by the two
arms of the TAT-14 transatlantic cable system and the Asian
backbone in Singapore served by the SEA-ME-WE3 and SEA-ME-
WE4 submarine cables.

Satellites

Satellite communications are used by Orange to support global
network connections for the French overseas territories, IP or voice
connectivity with other carriers, and VSAT (Very Small Aperture
Terminal) services for Orange Business Services terrestrial or maritime
business customers. To provide those services, Orange purchases
space segment from satellite operators (such as Eutelsat, Intelsat,
SES and Arabsat).

Submarine Cables

In order to accommodate the increase in international telecommunications
traffic, Orange has invested in a number of submarine cables through:

= participation in a consortium to build a cable that Orange will
co-own;

= purchase of usage rights or transmission capacity leasing on other
cables.

As with terrestrial networks, higher speeds systems on submarine
cables are being implemented and 40 Gbits/s then 100 Gbit/s systems
are already operational on several cables within the Orange group.

The migration to 100 Gbits/s technology on the SEA-ME-WES and
SEA-ME-WE4 cables completed in 2015 enables Orange to support
growth in traffic on the Europe-Asia route.

In the longer term, Orange is participating in SEA-ME-WES, a cable
linking Singapore to Europe, with connectivity towards the Indian
Ocean, which is scheduled to become operational at the end of 2016.
Also built using 100 Gbits/s technology, it will significantly increase
Orange's capacity on the Asia-Europe route and will provide new
connectivity towards the Indian Ocean via Djibouti to improve speeds
to Reunion and Mayotte, while preparing the switch from the older
SEA-MEA-WEAS and SEA-MEA-WE4.

Working as part of a consortium, Orange commissioned the first
phase of the ACE (Africa Coast to Europe) cable in December 2012.
Around 17,000 kilometers long, its potential capacity will reach
5.12 Thits/s thanks to the use of 40 Gbits/s transmission technology.
ACE currently extends from France to Gabon and Sao Tomé-et-
Principe. The extension work to South Africa started at the end of
2015 and is scheduled to become operational in 2017.

At the same time, in order to guarantee the security of its traffic by
diversifying its routes, Orange’s capacity on the SA8T3-WASC-SAFE,
cable was increased in 2014.

Orange is a co-owner of the LION (Lower Indian Ocean Network)
cables connecting Madagascar to the global broadband network via
Reunion and Mauritius, and LION2, the LION extension to Kenya
serving Mayotte. To meet the sustained growth in traffic, the Group.
has repeatedly invested in a capacity upgrade of both LION and
LION2, the most recent of which was operational at the end of 2015.

Atlantic Ocean

Orange is also active in the Caribbean where it has capacity on three
major cables: Americas-ll, ECFS, and CBUS. The Group took part in
capacity increases on these three cables to support the surge in
broadband use in France’s overseas departments. The additional
capacity was delivered in 2015.

Fixed-line voice network

In the countries in which it has fixed-line operations, Orange operates
a switched telephone network (STN) to deliver analog voice and ISDN
services. These networks are continually being optimized because of
declining usage.

Orange / 2015 Registration Document

3.2.1.5 IP transport networks
National IP networks

In each country in which it provides consumer services, Orange
operates a national IP network, supporting voice and data traffic, for
fixed-line, mobile, enterprise and wholesale services.

The International IP Network

Orange international IP Transit network, known as Open Transit
Internet (OTI), aims to provide global Internet connectivity to Group
subsidiaries’ domestic IP networks, operator customers, Internet
service providers (ISP) and content providers. It is based on the latest
IP transmission and switching technologies.

As of end-2015, the OTI connected 23 cities (12 in Europe, 2 in Asia,
8 in North America and 1 in Africa) through broadband connections
at speeds of 155 Mbits/s to 100 Gbits/s, with several hundred Gbits/s
of traffic at peak times. Traffic hit 3.7 Thits at end-2015.

The Multiservice IP eXchange

The IMN network (Multiservice IP Network) is a dedicated network,
using the IPXGSMA IR.34 standard, tasked with transporting sensitive
and high value-added data of mobile operators as well as transporting
Orange's International VoIP traffic.

Orange also rolled out fixed-line VoIP networks using IMS technology
(IP multimedia subsystem) in many countries for residential and
enterprise uses.

Mobile voice network

Until 2015, all mobile voice traffic was managed in switch mode by
the mobile network in each country. In 2015, Orange rolled out mobile
IMS infrastructure in Europe to offer VOLTE services (VoIP over LTE)
and WiFi calling (mobile Voice over WiFi). The first commercial
application of this technology was in Romania with the launch of
VoLTE in mid-September 2015. Other commercial launches are
scheduled for 2016.


--- Page 78 ---

The International Voice Network
Voice network

Orange has three international switching nodes in France (CTI 4G) to
manage traffic to and from France in the fixed-line and mobile markets
(TDM) for consumers, businesses and operators, and to centralize the
transfer of international traffic for its subsidiaries. These exchanges
have developed into hybrid NGN nodes to carry Voice over IP (VoIP)
traffic. The architecture of the international voice network underwent
a major change in 2013 with the installation of four SBC softswitches
(session border controllers) with routing functionality dedicated to
Voice over IP (VoIP). In December 2015, over 60% of VoIP traffic was
fully supported by this new infrastructure. The CTI4G will remain in
place to manage the decline in TDM.

Orange has two softswitches in the United States and a media
gateway in Hong Kong to manage in TDM or VoIP mode customers.
and operators from the Americas and Asia.

Signaling Network

Signaling system 7 (SS7) on the international network is provided by
two Signal Transfer Points (STP), which support the signaling
associated with voice traffic, roaming and SMS of 2G and 3G mobile
operators. A growing number of links serving roaming and SMS.
customers are supported by SIGTRAN signaling over IP, which at the
end of 2015 accounted for 85% of SS7 traffic.

With the arrival of 4G (LTE) networks, the signaling used for international
roaming is supported by IP (Diameter-type routers). Two DRF (Diameter
Router Function) have been added to the international network for the
roaming traffic of Orange subsidiaries and non-Group customers.

Several centralized platforms have been rolled out on the international
transit points to provide value-added services to mobile operators.

3.2.1.7 | Networks dedicated to business services
X.25 networks

X.25 was taken off the market in mid-2010 and the technical aspects
of the service were discontinued in June 2012.

However, X.25 still serves as a connection network in France and its
overseas territories for several thousand payment points, connected
with “intelligent network” services. The reintegration of this “intelligent
network” function into an IP network was completed in 2015 and the
X.25 network will be finally switched off in spring 2016.

Frame Relay/ATM Networks

In France, the Frame Relay/ATM network is an access network used
to support both business (particularly through the TDSL aggregation
offers) and a layer 3 (X.25 and IP) services. It has been deployed in
around 150 points of presence in mainland France, in the five
overseas departments and in two overseas territories (New Caledonia
and French Polynesia).

The activity on the FR/ATM network is declining, and businesses’
need for increased speed is increasingly met by the IP/MPLS services
available on the “Network for Business Access to IP” (RAEI). A FR/ATM
network optimization program was launched.

Overview of the group’s business
Network and real estate

The Network for Business Access to IP (RAEI) in France

The main purpose of the RAEI is to connect a company’s sites for
internal data exchange on the Virtual Private Network (VPN) and to
provide it with Internet connectivity. It also provides Voice over IP
transport for companies.

It is made up of a core infrastructure of around 60 transit routers that
are interconnected by multiple 10 Gbits/s links, or 100 Gbits/s links.
This backbone network also provides the interconnection with the
Backbone and IP Aggregation Network (RBC) for Internet traffic and
for business aggregation traffic coming from NAS and BAS.

In addition, a ring of approximately 700 PE (Provider Edge) routers gives
companies access to xDSL and Ethernet technologies, at speeds of
75 Kbits/s to 1 Gbits/s, under standard offers. The routers are located
in major cities and business areas.

This network is connected to the IP Global Network through four
gateways (located in Paris, Lille and Lyon) to connect international
business customers.

With the takeover of the RTGE network, the number of IP presence
points increased with 200 new sites added in 2014 and 2015.

The international MPLS/IP VPN network
(IP Global Network IGN and AGN access network)

Like the IP network in France (RAEI), this network is designed to
supply Virtual Private Network (VPN), Internet and Voice over IP.
services. At the end of October 2015, the network comprised
714 points of presence (including partner MPLS networks) across
141 countries. Direct presence in the countries decreased (165 countries
in 2014) as Orange is developing a partnership strategy (Network to
Network Interface or NNI) in order to cover certain regions and
countries more effectively. 41 additional countries are covered by such
partnerships.

The network is made up of dozens of core network routers (P routers
and similar) and several hundred access routers (PE routers) that
make up multiservice platforms (Ethernet, DSL, FR/ATM). The services
are offered either directly on the access routers, through the Frame
Relay/ATM access network (AGN-ATM Global Network), or through
partner networks under NNI agreements.

IGN+ is a program to expand the geographic coverage of the IGN
network that was launched to eventually offer native IP services
everywhere and thus do away with the AGN aggregation layer.

The international business voice network (NEO)

NEO is a network supplying voice services for international businesses.
Based on the international MPLS IP network (IGN), this business voice
network has 61 points of presence in 38 countries, and is connected
to some 50 operators worldwide. It allows calls to be aggregated and
terminated with these operators, for customers connected to the
Orange Business Services network over IP (H323 or SIP) or TDM.

technical centers, most of which are fully owned (2.6 million sq.m.,
including 2.1 million sq.m. owned), offices, most of which are leased
(2,2 million sq.m., including 1.3 million sq.m. leased), and stores, most
of which are leased (81,659 sq.m., including 75,135 sq.m. leased).

In Poland, the properties held by Orange Polska at the end of 2015
represented 1.8 million sq.m. The total surface area of developed and
undeveloped land represented 13.2 million sq.m.

3.3 Research and innovation

The information and communication technology (ICT) sector in recent
years has gone through major changes in its value chain, significantly
increasing the number of players. New economic models developed
by large Web players are coming into existence, while manufacturers
of consumer electronics are moving towards value-added services.
In this context, innovation will be a major source of growth for Orange.
In 2015, Orange continued its efforts in research and innovation and

3.3.1. Research and innovation

3.3.2 Open innovation

Since 2013, Orange has strengthened its open innovation strategy
based on sharing and collaboration. The main pillars of this approach are:

= supporting start-ups and SMEs. Orange has launched a network
of start-up accelerators known as Orange Fab in 10 countries
across 4 continents. Created in March 2013 in Silicon Valley, the
Orange Fab program was rolled out internationally in 2014 in
France, in Asia, in Japan (followed by South Korea and Taiwan),
Poland, Ivory Coast, Israel and Jordan. The most recent Orange
Fab was established in Spain in July 2015. Orange helps selected
start-ups grow their businesses, and in certain countries also
provides financial and logistical support. In order to foster the
growth of these start-ups, Orange and Deutsche Telekom
announced (in June 2014) their collaboration on their respective
Orange Fab and hub: raum acceleration programs. This initiative
was strengthened in September 2015 as a result of the alliance
between Orange, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica. This
partnership provides start-ups selected by the operators’ respective
programs with access to the markets in which the latter operate in
Europe, Africa, Latin America, South East Asia and the Middle East,
thereby contributing to the emergence of new European, and even
global, leaders. The partnership with NUMA (space dedicated to
innovation and digital technology, launched in Paris in 2013 with
Orange as a founding member) is also part of this initiative. The
Group is a also a member of two tech-industry co-working spaces,
bringing together innovators and entrepreneurs (scientists,
engineers, developers, ergonomics experts and designers) from a
wide variety of backgrounds (start-ups, large companies, SMEs,
universities);

innovative services to its customers. At end-2015, Orange had a
catalog of over twenty Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
in self-service mode, grouped into three categories: i) APIs for

3.3.3 Private Equity

Orange plays a key role in financing innovation in the IT industry,
notably through investments in the following three types of vehicles:

= mono-corporate ventures (fully-owned investment companies) such
as in particular:

- Orange Digital Ventures, which is the Group's investment vehicle
for young start-ups. It supplements Orange's open innovation
range, particularly in the following areas: new connectivity,
enterprise services (SaaS, Big Data, Security, process digitization),
mobile banking & mobile payment, Internet of Things, and digital
services for Africa and the Middle East,

- french holding company Orange Technologies Investissements
(OTl), initially established to monetize Orange's intellectual
property in exchange for stakes in high-tech start-ups;

= multi-corporate ventures (joint investment companies), typically set
up with other industrial companies but occasionally also involving
financial firms. These multi-corporate ventures include:
