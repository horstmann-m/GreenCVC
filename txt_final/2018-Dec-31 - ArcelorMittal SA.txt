6 Management report

Company overview
History and development of the Company

ArcelorMittal is the world’s leading integrated steel and
mining company. It results from the merger in 2007 of its
predecessor companies Mittal Steel Company N.V. and
Arcelor, each of which had grown through acquisitions over
many years. Since its creation ArcelorMittal has
experienced periods of external growth as well consolidation
and deleveraging (including through divestments), the latter
in particular during the years following the global financial
and economic crises of 2008-2010. In recent years
ArcelorMittal has punctuated its overall deleveraging focus
with targeted acquisitions. These have included the
acquisition through a joint venture of the Calvert plant in the
United States in 2014 and, in 2018 the acquisition of
Votorantim S.A.'s long business in Brazil and Ilva in Italy,
Europe's largest single steel site. Most recently the
Company is poised (subject to favorable resolution of legal
challenges) to acquire ESIL (via a joint venture with
NSSMC), its bid having been selected by ESIL’s committee
of creditors. For more information on the key transactions
carried out in 2018, see “—Key transactions and events in
2018” below.

ArcelorMittal's success is built on its core values of
sustainability, quality and leadership and the entrepreneurial
boldness that has empowered its emergence as the first
truly global steel and mining company. Acknowledging that a
combination of structural issues and macroeconomic
conditions will continue to challenge returns in its sector, the
Company has adapted its footprint to the new demand
realities, redoubled its efforts to control costs and
repositioned its operations with a view toward outperforming
its competitors. ArcelorMittal’s research and development
capability is strong and includes several major research
centers as well as strong academic partnerships with
universities and other scientific bodies.

Against this backdrop, ArcelorMittal's strategy is to leverage
four distinctive attributes that will enable it to capture leading
positions in the most attractive areas of the steel industry's
value chain, from mining at one end to distribution and first-
stage processing at the other: global scale and scope;
superior technical capabilities; a diverse portfolio of steel
and related businesses, one of which is mining; and
financial capabilities.

Geography: ArcelorMittal is the largest steel producer in the
Americas, Africa and Europe and is the fifth largest steel
producer in the CIS region. ArcelorMittal has steel-making
operations in 19 countries on four continents, including 48
integrated and mini-mill steel-making facilities. As of
December 31, 2018, ArcelorMittal had approximately
209,000 employees.

ArcelorMittal’s steel-making operations have a high degree
of geographic diversification. Approximately 38% of its crude
steel is produced in the Americas, approximately 48% is
produced in Europe and approximately 14% is produced in
other countries, such as Kazakhstan, South Africa and
Ukraine. In addition, ArcelorMittal’s sales of steel products
are spread over both developed and developing markets,
which have different consumption characteristics.
ArcelorMittal’s mining operations, present in North and
South America, Africa, Europe and the CIS region, are
integrated with its global steel-making facilities and are
important producers of iron ore and coal in their own right.

Products: ArcelorMittal produces a broad range of high-
quality finished and semi-finished steel products (“semis”).
Specifically, ArcelorMittal produces flat steel products,
including sheet and plate, and long steel products, including
bars, rods and structural shapes. In addition, ArcelorMittal
produces pipes and tubes for various applications.
ArcelorMittal sells its steel products primarily in local
markets and through its centralized marketing organization
to a diverse range of customers in approximately 160
countries including the automotive, appliance, engineering,
construction and machinery industries. The Company also
produces various types of mining products including iron ore
lump, fines, concentrate and sinter feed, as well as coking,
PCI and thermal coal.

As a global steel producer, the Company is able to meet the
needs of different markets. Steel consumption and product
requirements clearly differ between developed markets and
developing markets. Steel consumption in developed
economies is weighted towards flat products and a higher
value-added mix, while developing markets utilize a higher
proportion of long products and commodity grades. To meet
these diverse needs, the Company maintains a high degree
of product diversification and seeks opportunities to
increase the proportion of higher value-added products in its
product mix.

Automotive focus: ArcelorMittal has a leading market share
in its core markets in the automotive steel business and is a
leader in the fast-growing advanced high strength steels
segment. ArcelorMittal is the first steel company in the world
to embed its own engineers within an automotive customer
to provide engineering support. The Company begins
working with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) as
early as five years before a vehicle reaches the showroom,
to provide generic steel solutions, co-engineering and help
with the industrialization of the project. In November 2016,
ArcelorMittal introduced a new generation of advanced high
strength steels, including new press hardenable steels and
martensitic steels. Together, these new steel grades aim to
help automakers further reduce body-in-white weight to
improve fuel economy without compromising vehicle safety
or performance. In November 2017, ArcelorMittal launched
the second generation of its iCARe® electrical steels.

iCARe® steel grades play a central role in the construction
of electric motors.

Mining Value Chain: ArcelorMittal has a significant portfolio
of raw material and mining assets. In 2018, approximately
49% of ArcelorMittal’s iron-ore requirements and
approximately 12% of its PCI and coal requirements were
supplied from its own mines. The Company currently has
iron ore mining activities in Brazil, Bosnia, Canada,
Kazakhstan, Liberia, Mexico, Ukraine and the United States.
The Company currently has coal mining activities in
Kazakhstan and the United States.

In addition, ArcelorMittal produces substantial amounts of
direct reduced iron, or DRI, which is a scrap substitute used
in its mini-mill facilities to supplement external metallics
purchases. ArcelorMittal is also a significant producer of
coke, which is produced from metallurgical coal and is a
critical raw material for steel-making, satisfying 91% of its
coke needs through its own production facilities.
ArcelorMittal’s facilities have good access to shipping
facilities, including through ArcelorMittal’s own, or partially
owned, 15 deep-water port facilities and linked railway
sidings.

ArcelorMittal has its own downstream steel distribution
business, primarily run through its Europe segment. It also
provides value-added and customized steel solutions
through additional processing activities to meet specific
customer requirements.

Energy market

Solid fuels, electricity and natural gas are some of the
primary raw material inputs for a steelmaker. ArcelorMittal is
exposed to price volatility in each of these raw materials
with respect to its purchases in the spot market and under
its long-term supply contracts. Since most of the minerals
used in the steel-making process are finite resources, they
may also rise in response to any perceived scarcity of
remaining accessible supplies, combined with the evolution
of the pipeline of new exploration projects to replace
depleted resources.

Oil

In a year which was defined by political turmoil, the global
oil market went from a tightening of the supply/demand
balance to the prospect of a supply surplus. This came amid
the general fear of an economic slowdown beyond 2018 as
an intensifying tariff war between the world’s biggest
economies could dent global demand growth combined with
record high shale oil output from the U.S.

In the first quarter of 2016, after tumbling for six quarters in
a row, the Brent crude oil price came to a halt just south of
$30/barrel (“bbl”). In the following six months, prices climbed
back up to levels around $50/bbI. A group of producers led
by OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries) and Russia agreed at the end of 2016 to cut
production and cap output at 1.8 million barrels per day
(“bpd”). Initially, the cuts were to last for only six months but
got extended in May 2017 and again in November 2017. As
a result, in the summer of 2017, the momentum shifted and
prices gained 75% year-on-year from $45/bbl in May 2017
to $80/bbI in May 2018. In June 2018, OPEC and its allies
decided to increase production by 1 million bpd. This came
at a time when the U.S. had just pulled out of the Iran
nuclear deal, and was threatening sanctions against any
country which further imported Iranian oil. The market
reacted with a delayed price hike with the Brent crude oil
front month contract peaking at $86/bbl (a 4-year high) in
October 2018, only to fall more than 30% in the following
month. To stop plummeting prices, a last effort from OPEC
and its allies was made in early December, when they jointly
decided to cut output by 1.2 million bpd throughout the first

half of 2019. Brent crude oil finished the year at $53.8/bbl, a
15-month low.

co2

The integrated steel process involves carbon and COs,
which distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini-
mills and many other industries where CO; generation is
primarily linked to energy use. Launched in 2005, the
European Union Emission Trading System (“EU-ETS”) is
currently in its third phase, stretching from 2013 to 2020.
After 2020, this system may require ArcelorMittal to incur
additional costs to acquire emissions allowances. The EU-
ETS is based on a cap-and-trade principle; it sets a cap on
greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) from covered
installations, which is then reduced year after year. Since
2009, a surplus of emission allowances has built up in the
EU-ETS, kept prices below €10 per ton of CO2 equivalent
(“€/tCO2e”) until 2018. In 2016 and 2017, the price for a
European Union Allowance (“EUA’”) - which gives the holder
the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide (“CO2”) - ranged
between €4/tCO2e and €6/tCO2e.

To boost the EUA price and to provide an incentive to the
industry and the power sector to alter their behavior in terms
of CO2 emissions, in July 2015 the European Commission
proposed a reform of the EU-ETS for the period 2021-2030
(phase 4). More than 2 years later, inter-institutional
negotiations were concluded presenting solutions to reduce
the current surplus. Consequently, in November 2017 the
EUA price crossed the €8/tCO2e mark for the first time

since January 2016. With the EU Council's final approval in
February 2018, the ETS reform became law (directive
2018/410). As a result, the EUA price surged up further and
only came to a halt after surpassing the historical high of
€25/tCO2e in September 2018. This marked a 360% price
increase in only nine months. The EUA price has been
subsequently trading around the €20/tCO2e mark driven by
uncertainties around Brexit and the looming market stability
reserve (“MSR’) which started operating in January 2019.
See "Risks related to the global economy and the mining
and steel industry". Laws and regulations restricting
emissions of greenhouse gases could force ArcelorMittal to
incur increased capital and operating costs and could have
a material adverse effect on ArcelorMittal's results of
operations and financial condition.

Thermal coal

Thermal coal prices have followed the same commodity
super-cycle as crude oil and reached the low levels of $45/t
at the beginning of 2016. Throughout 2016, prices had been
on the rise and by the end of the year had almost doubled.
After a sharp drop during the first two quarters of 2017
prices rebounded and finished the year strong. This came
on the back of intensified demand from Asia which was
witnessing one of the coldest winters ever recorded. The
2017/2018 winter began with a Chinese campaign aimed at
switching millions of households from using coal to natural
gas for heating purposes. At the same time, the country
tightened imports by banning small ports from receiving
foreign coal cargoes. The campaign unexpectedly boosted
demand from coal-fired power plants as it created a
shortage of natural gas. The tightening of the Asian market
had some severe spill-overs to the European market and
pushed the spot price for the all publications index number 2
(“API2”) - which reflects the price for imports into ARA
(Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp) - above $90/t, a level not
seen since the end of 2012. Throughout the first quarter of
2018, the API2 shed almost 20% as the global supply
demand balance softened amid the Chinese New Year
holiday. After increasing throughout the second quarter of
2018, the API2 reached a new 6-year high when it
surpassed the $100/t mark in the third quarter. This was
triggered by utilities replenishing stocks and strong demand
from power stations due to a hot and dry summer. In the
fourth quarter of 2018, prices remained volatile but
decreased almost 20% amid China's imposition of new
import restrictions, and Europe benefiting from a mild start
to the winter.

Natural gas - Europe

Year after year the natural gas market is turning more into a
global commodity due to the continuous development of
liquefied natural gas (“LNG”), driven by the construction of
new liquefaction units (called trains) in Russia, Australia and
in the U.S. The worldwide LNG exports reached 430 billion
cubic meters (“bcm”) in 2018, an increase of 8.2%


--- Page 4 ---

compared to 2017. Consequently, natural gas is
increasingly exposed to the same commodity super-cycles
that also affect thermal coal and crude oil, for example.
Unlike thermal coal and crude oil, the European natural gas
market is showing stronger seasonal patterns.

Despite starting the year at the same price level as 2017,
the 2018 TTF Spot Price (the price for natural gas to be
delivered the next day, which is traded on a virtual trading
platform located in the Netherlands) averaged €22.85 per
Megawatt hour (“€/MWh”), which is more than 30% higher
than the 2017 average (€17.32/MWh) and far above 2016
when prices settled at €14.03/MWh on average. Several
events affected the transportation of natural gas in 2017 (an
explosion at the Gas Connect Austria's Baumgarten site in
eastern Austria and the shut-down of the Forties pipeline
system, both of which happened at the end of year). 2018
started with milder than normal weather but a late cold snap
at the end of February brought freezing temperatures from
Siberia to Europe. Combined with limited storage flexibility
and supply problems across Europe, spot prices at major
European hubs skyrocketed to multi-year highs. In the
aftermath, northwest European natural gas storage levels
dropped well below the 5-year average. Efforts to refill
storages, together with strong summer demand from natural
gas fired power plants, exceptional high LNG prices and an
overall rising energy complex kept supporting European
natural gas prices up until the start of the fourth quarter of
2018 (an increase of 50% throughout the first nine months
of the year). During the last quarter of the year, the TTF spot
price tumbled from €29.5/MWh down to €22.0/MWh on the
back of milder than seasonal temperatures, significantly
improved storage levels, strong LNG arrivals and pipeline
imports from Norway and Russia operating close to their
maximum capacity.

Natural gas - United States

In 2018, natural gas production in the U.S. remained strong
at a level of 102 billion cubic feet per day (“bcf/d”). In North
America, natural gas prices trade independently of oil prices
and are set by spot and future contracts, traded on the
NYMEX exchange or over-the-counter. U.S. thermal coal
continues to be challenged as a power producing fuel. Gas
power plants first took the lead in the generation mix in
2016, which continued in 2017 with around 32% of
electricity produced from burning natural gas. This trend
accelerated in 2018 with just over 30GW of new capacity
entering commercial service.

Management report 9

U.S. LNG export capacity stands at 4.9 bef/d, almost 2.4
bef/d added in 2018 compared to 2016 (1.38 bcf/d), the year
the U.S. entered the LNG exporting business. Projections
show that U.S. LNG export capacity will reach 8.9 billion bcf/
d by the end of 2019, making it the third largest in the world
behind Australia and Qatar. The rise of U.S. LNG is driven
by the strong development of U.S. shale gas. The number
of rigs increased significantly compared to 2017 levels, with
the Permian basin marking the biggest increase of close to
100 additional rigs compared to 2017.

In 2017, the Henry Hub front month price (the price for gas
traded on a U.S. virtual trading platform, for delivery in the
next calendar month) increased by 27% as compared to an
average of $3.08 per million British Thermal Units (“$/
MMBtu”) in 2016. In the first nine months of 2018, month
ahead prices averaged $2.85/MMBtu, a 6.5% decrease
compared to the first nine months of 2017. The recession in
natural gas prices that held from the beginning of 2015 until
September 2018 changed in the first two weeks of
November 2018, as weather-related natural gas demand
increased sharply, and the relatively low levels of natural
gas in storage could not provide the needed flexibility
leading to 60% price hike in only 10 days. In mid-November
2018, the front-month Henry Hub natural gas futures hit a
price of $4.8/MMBtu, the highest price since the second
quarter of 2014. Consequently, end of November natural
gas inventories stood 19% lower than the previous five-year
average forcing the Henry Hub Month Ahead price to
average $4.0/MMBtu throughout November and December
2018.

Natural gas - Asia

The Platts Japan Korea Marker (JKM) - the LNG benchmark
price assessment for spot physical cargoes delivered ex-
ship into Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan - front
month contract finished the year 2017 at the highest levels
since the first quarter of 2015 ($11.2/MMBtu). Throughout
the first quarter of 2018 prices dropped 35% (equivalent to
$4/MMBtu) and bottomed at $7.2/MMBtu before entering a
period of increasing prices. While prices normally would
have relaxed on the back of muted demand from Asian
consumers at the end of June 2018, the front month
contract again surpassed the 11 USD/MMBtu level ($6/
MMBtu higher year-on-year). However, in 2018 strong Asian
restocking demand ahead of the winter met strong cooling
needs. At the end of the first quarter of 2018, the price
spread between the Pacific and the Atlantic basin dropped
below $1/MMBtu erasing the arbitrage window and allowing
LNG cargoes to sail to Europe. This spread quickly
increased to $3.7/MMBtu dragging cargoes away from
Europe. After a period of high volatility, the spread stabilized
around $2.0/MMBtu by the end of the third quarter and into
the fourth quarter, fueled by lackluster Asian demand. At the
same time, charter rates for LNG vessels exploded and
moved north of $160,000/day (a long way from the lows of
2016 and 2017 when spot rates were hovering at $25,000/

day). This led to trapped LNG supply in the Atlantic basin
leading to sharply dropping European natural gas prices.

Electricity - Europe

Unlike the natural gas market, electricity prices are only
indirectly influenced by commodity super-cycles. Due to the
regional nature of electricity markets prices follow mainly
local drivers (i.e. energy mix of the respective country,
power generation from renewables, country specific energy

policies, etc.). However, unlike previous years, 2018 marked

a structural change with the emergence of the carbon price
as one of the major price drivers. The forward baseload
power contract for the front calendar year (delivery 2019)

strongly increased in all European market places throughout

the year (e.g. from €40.5 to €59.1/MWh in Belgium (an
increase of 46% year-to-date), from €41.75 to €58.45/MWh
in France (an increase of 40% year-to-date) and from €36.7
to €52.7/MWh in Germany (an increase of 44% year-to-
date). The 2018 price increase was mainly due to the
overall fuel price increases, the unreliability of an aging
French and Belgian nuclear fleet and a weak year in terms
of renewable output.

Business overview

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial
statements and related notes for the year ended December
31, 2018 included in this annual report.

Key factors affecting results of operations

The steel industry, and the iron ore and coal mining
industries, which provide its principal raw materials, have
historically been highly cyclical. They are significantly
affected by general economic conditions, consumption
trends as well as by worldwide production capacity and
fluctuations in international steel trade and tariffs. In
particular, this is due to the cyclical nature of the
automotive, construction, machinery and equipment and
transportation industries that are the principal consumers of
steel. A telling example of the industry cyclicality was the
sharp downturn in 2008/2009 after several strong years,
which was a result of the global economic crisis.

Weakness in North American and European markets has a
significant impact on ArcelorMittal’s results, with these
markets together accounting for over 60% of ArcelorMittal's
deliveries in 2018. Historically, in 2012, the onset of the
eurozone crisis caused underlying European steel demand
to weaken and, coupled with significant destocking,
apparent steel demand fell by over 10%. Since then,
deliveries have increased in each of the past six years,
rising almost 3% per annum, returning to the average
demand levels seen during the period between 2000 to
2005. However, deliveries remain approximately 18% below
the 2007 peak. Imports into the European Union (“EU”)
have also risen more strongly than demand, more than
doubling since 2012 to over 31 million tonnes in 2018,
meaning domestic European deliveries have lost market
share, impacting the ability of ArcelorMittal to serve one of
its largest markets. Underlying steel demand in North
America increased strongly post-crisis, but apparent
demand has been impacted by inventory movements, with
high inventory levels resulting in stockists purchasing over
six million fewer tonnes in 2015, as compared to 2014, as
they sought to reduce inventory levels as steel prices
declined. This caused a 10% decline in apparent steel
demand in 2015, which negatively impacted the Company’s
deliveries and profitability. Apparent demand in the United
States declined further in 2016 as inventories continued to
decrease and demand for Oil and Country Tubular Goods
(“OCTG”) was still very weak. The situation has since
improved, with apparent steel demand growing over 6%
year-on-year in 2017, due mainly to growth in pipes and
tubes, demand for which was up around 85% year-on-year
compared to only 2% growth in flat and a slight decline in
longs. Apparent steel demand grew again in 2018 by an
estimated 2% and 3% for flat and long products
respectively, while demand for pipes and tubes declined
slightly. Steel prices also recovered significantly in the

United States in 2018, due to the imposition of 25% Section
232 tariffs in the United States, coupled with improving
capacity utilization. With the United States expected to be
enjoying the longest economic expansion on record by the
middle of 2019, and given the frailty of the current global
economic outlook, any new economic downturn, especially
one having a major negative impact on developed markets,
could significantly impact ArcelorMittal’s deliveries and
profitability. See "Risks related to the global economy and
the mining and steel industry."

Demand dynamics in China have also substantially affected
the global steel business. Historically, after growing strongly
since 2000, Chinese steel demand started to decline in
2015 because of weaker real estate sector construction and
machinery production. This decline in domestic demand led
to a surge in Chinese steel exports, which more than
doubled between 2012 and 2015, increasing by over 56
million tonnes to 112 million tonnes in 2015. This increase in
Chinese exports was greater than the growth in world ex-
China steel demand over the same period, and had the
effect of curtailing domestic production in countries outside
of China. A rebound in domestic demand and the beginning
of a capacity reduction plan in China in the second half of
2016 led to a decline in exports, by 14% year-on-year in the
second half of 2016 and by 3% for the year as whole. While
most exports were directed to Asia, and exports to the U.S.
were reduced due to the impact of anti-dumping trade
cases, a declining but still significant proportion were being
directed toward ArcelorMittal’s core European markets in
2016. In particular, Chinese exports in 2015 were being sold
at prices below cost (China Iron and Steel Association
(CISA) reported CISA mills losing an accumulated RMB 65
billion ($10 billion) in 2015), negatively impacting prices and
therefore margins in many regions. Chinese producers
continued to accumulate losses until April 2016 when
domestic and export prices rose sharply as domestic
demand surprised producers on the upside, increasing
capacity utilization. Since the second half of 2016, not only
has demand continued to grow but significant capacity has
been closed, consisting of over 150 million tonnes of legal
blast furnace capacity and an estimated 120 million tonnes
of illegal induction furnaces. This has led to a significantly
higher capacity utilization rate, despite a 40 million tonnes
reduction in exports over the past few years, translating into
a much improved domestic spread of steel prices over raw
material costs, and therefore higher export prices. Starting
in October 2017, this situation combined with environmental
policies which led to temporary capacity restrictions over the
winter period, and caused even higher utilization rates in
China and an even higher spread of steel prices over raw
materials. Although prices have since fallen back as these
temporary capacity restrictions were less strictly enforced in
October 2018, utilization rates remain high and the risk of a
renewed flood of Chinese exports has been reduced; it
currently appears likely to occur again only if Chinese
capacity were to increase and/or if Chinese demand were to

weaken significantly. Excess capacity and oversupply in the
steel industry and in the iron ore mining industry have in the
past and may continue in the future to weigh on the
profitability of steel producers, including ArcelorMittal.”

Unlike many commodities, steel is not completely fungible
due to wide differences in its shape, chemical composition,
quality, specifications and application, all of which affect
sales prices. Accordingly, there is still limited exchange
trading and uniform pricing of steel, whereas there is
increasing trading of steel raw materials, particularly iron
ore. Commodity spot prices can vary, which causes sale
prices from exports to fluctuate as a function of the
worldwide balance of supply and demand at the time sales
are made.

ArcelorMittal’s sales are made based on shorter-term
purchase orders as well as some longer-term contracts to
certain industrial customers, particularly in the automotive
industry. Steel price surcharges are often implemented on
steel sold pursuant to long-term contracts to recover
increases in input costs. However, spot market steel, iron
ore and coal prices and short-term contracts are more
driven by market conditions.

One of the principal factors affecting the Company’s
operating profitability is the relationship between raw
material prices and steel selling prices. Profitability depends
in part on the extent to which steel selling prices exceed raw
material prices, and specifically the extent to which changes
in raw material prices are passed through to customers in
steel selling prices. Complicating factors include the extent
of the time lag between (a) the raw material price change
and the steel selling price change and (b) the date of the
raw material purchase and of the actual sale of the steel
product in which the raw material was used (average cost
basis). In recent periods, steel selling prices have tended to
react quickly to changes in raw material prices, due in part
to the tendency of distributors to increase purchases of steel
products early in a rising cycle of raw material prices and to
hold back from purchasing as raw material prices decline.
With respect to (b), as average cost basis is used to
determine the cost of the raw materials incorporated,
inventories must first be worked through before a decrease
in raw material prices translates into decreased operating
costs. In some of ArcelorMittal’s segments, in particular
Europe and NAFTA, there are several months between raw
material purchases and sales of steel products incorporating
those materials. Although this lag has been reduced
recently by changes to the timing of pricing adjustments in
iron ore contracts, it cannot be eliminated and exposes
these segments’ margins to changes in steel selling prices
in the interim (known as a “price-cost squeeze”). In addition,
decreases in steel prices may outstrip decreases in raw
material costs in absolute terms, as has occurred numerous
times over the past few years, for example in the second
quarter of 2013 and fourth quarters of 2015, 2016 and 2018.

The Company's operating profitability has been particularly
sensitive to fluctuations in raw material prices, which have
become more volatile since the iron ore industry moved
away from annual benchmark pricing to quarterly pricing in
2010. Volatility on steel margins aside, the results of the
Company's mining segment (which sells externally as well
as internally) are also directly impacted by iron ore prices,
which decreased significantly in 2015, ending the year at
$40 per tonne ("/t") and averaging only $56/t. Iron ore prices
rebounded from $40/t during December 2015 to an average
of $52/t in the first half of 2016, increasing to an average of
$64/t during the second half of the year for a yearly average
of $58/t. The upward trend continued into the first quarter of
2017 with an average of $86/t, and then fluctuated between
$60-75/t during most of the following two years, leading to
an annual average of $71/t in 2017 and $69/t in 2018.
Despite recent iron ore price weakness, iron ore prices in
January 2019 averaged $76/t, at the top of the trading range
for the last two years due to the strength of Chinese steel
production. If iron ore prices were to decline from these
levels due (among other things) to weaker global, and
especially Chinese demand, this would negatively impact
ArcelorMittal’s revenues and profitability. See Risks related
to the global economy and the mining and steel industry—
Protracted low steel and iron ore prices would likely have an
adverse effect on ArcelorMittal’s results of operations.

Economic environment

Global GDP growth peaked at 3% in both 2017 and 2018,
and is now beginning to moderate as the recovery in trade
and manufacturing activity loses steam. Despite ongoing
negotiations, trade tensions among major economies
remain elevated. These tensions, combined with concerns
about softening global growth prospects, have weighed on
investor sentiment and contributed to declines in global
equity prices. Borrowing costs for emerging market and
developing economies ("EMDEs") have increased, in part
as major advanced-economy central banks continue to
withdraw policy accommodations in varying degrees. A
strengthening U.S. dollar, heightened financial market
volatility, and rising risk premiums have intensified capital
outflow and currency pressures in some large EMDEs, with
some vulnerable countries experiencing substantial financial
stress. Energy prices have fluctuated markedly, mainly due
to supply factors, with sharp falls experienced towards the
end of 2018.

U.S. growth in 2018 is estimated to have picked up to 2.9%,
from 2.2% in 2017, mostly reflecting stronger than-expected
domestic demand. Activity was bolstered by pro-cyclical
fiscal stimulus and still-accommodative monetary policy. The
labor market remains robust, with the unemployment rate
near a 50-year low, which bolstered consumption. Labor
productivity is showing signs of picking up. Nominal wage
gains have been outpacing inflation, resulting in modest real
wage growth. Long-term inflation expectations have edged
up but remain stable. During 2018, the U.S. administration


--- Page 8 ---

raised tariffs on about $300 billion worth of imports, mostly
from China. As a result, other countries have retaliated with
tariffs on about $150 billion worth of U.S. exports. In all, new
tariffs have been imposed on about 12% of U.S. goods
imports and may expand further, resulting in higher prices
and elevated policy uncertainty. See "Risks related to the
global economy and the mining and steel industry". Unfair
trade practices in ArcelorMittal’s home markets could
negatively affect steel prices and reduce ArcelorMittal’s
profitability, while trade sanctions and barriers may have an
adverse effect on ArcelorMittal’s operations in various
markets.

EU GDP growth slowed notably from 2.6% in 2017 to 2% in
2018. Exports have softened, reflecting the earlier
appreciation of the euro and slowing external demand.
Inflation remains low despite declines in unemployment.
The European Central Bank has stopped adding to its
balance sheet, although it is expected to maintain its
negative interest rate policy until at least mid-2019.
Financial system lending and profitability have continued to
increase, though some EU banks may be exposed to
financial stress in some EMDEs. Across the euro area, fiscal
policy is expected to be mildly expansionary. Increased
German expenditures are expected to lead to smaller
surpluses, while deficits in France and Italy are likely to rise
amid public pressures for additional spending and tax relief.
Italy’s borrowing costs have increased and remain volatile,
reflecting uncertainties about the outlook of the country’s
debt load.

Growth in China is estimated to have slowed from 6.9% in
2017 to a still robust 6.6% in 2018, supported by resilient
consumption, although the trend in the fourth quarter of
2018 was down further. A rebound in private fixed
investment helped offset a decline in public infrastructure
and other state spending. However, industrial production
and export growth have decelerated, reflecting easing
global manufacturing activity. Import growth continued to
outpace export growth, contributing to a shrinking current
account surplus. Net capital outflows have resumed, and
international reserves have been edging down. Stock prices
and the Renminbi have experienced continued downward
pressures, and sovereign bond spreads have risen amid
ongoing trade tensions and concerns about the growth
outlook. New regulations on commercial bank exposures to
shadow financing, together with stricter provisions for off-
budget borrowing by local governments, have slowed credit
growth to the non-financial sector. However, in mid- and late
2018, the Chinese authorities reiterated their intention to
pursue looser macroeconomic policies to counter the
potential economic impact of trade disputes with the United
States. Prices of newly constructed residential buildings
have rebounded, including in Tier 1 cities, following several
years of correction. Consumer price inflation has generally
moved up since mid-2018, partly reflecting currency

Management report 13

depreciation and higher energy and food prices in most of
last year, but it remains below target.

Growth in Brazil was lackluster in 2018 at 1.2%, reflecting
the country's emergence from a severe recession, a
truckers’ strike mid-year and continued policy uncertainty. In
Russia, growth was resilient at 1.6% in 2018, supported by
private consumption and exports; however, momentum has
slowed, reflecting policy uncertainty, recent oil price
declines, and renewed pressures on currency and asset
prices. In Turkey, growth slowed down to 2.9% (from 7.4%
in 2017) due in part to substantial deterioration in foreign
investor confidence. Growth in Argentina plummeted to
2.1% in 2018 (from 2.9% in 2017) following acute financial
market stress that resulted in sharp currency depreciation
and monetary policy tightening, which have led to Argentina
being designated a hyper-inflationary economy. In South
Africa, activity contracted in the first half of 2018 and,
despite a recovery in the second half, growth remained
subdued at 0.7% in 2018 (from 1.3% in 2017), reflecting
challenges in mining production, low business confidence,
and policy uncertainty.

Global apparent steel consumption (“ASC”) grew further in
2018 after a robust growth in 2017, compared to growth of
just over 1% in 2016. Growth in 2018 reflected increases in
demand in most markets with the notable exceptions of
Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey and Venezuela.
Overall, 2018 global ASC is estimated to have grown over
2.8% as Chinese demand was stronger than anticipated,
growing approximately 3.5%, supported by the strength of
machinery output and a better than expected real estate
market. Elsewhere, world-ex-China ASC grew around 2.1%
year-on-year, supported by strong growth in Indian sub-
continent (7.5%), Latin America (4%), ASEAN (4%), Africa
(3.5%) and EU28 (3%). Further regions grew more slowly
including CIS (2%) and NAFTA (1%) where growth in the
U.S. of almost 2% was offset by declining demand in
Mexico. Demand growth in world ex-China was impacted by
a sharp decline in Turkish steel demand (a 10% decrease)
due to the crisis that hit the economy during the second half
of 2018 and a slight decline in developed Asia (a 0.5%
decrease).

Steel production®!

After reaching a peak of over 1.67 billion tonnes in 2014,
world crude steel production declined by 3% in 2015 to 1.62
billion tonnes as output fell in every major steel producing
market, except India. In 2016 global output grew marginally
as Chinese output increased by under 4 million tonnes and
World ex-China growth, which had fallen by 3.6% year-on-
year in 2015, rising by 0.4% in 2016 due to higher output
from developing countries such as India (+7.2%), Ukraine
(+5.4%) and Turkey (+5.2%), although this was partially
offset by lower output from South America (-8.4%), EU28
(-2.5%) and developed Asia (-0.6%).

However, over the past two years global steel production
grew strongly rising 6.3% in 2017 to 1.73 billion tonnes in
line with a strengthening global economy. In 2018, despite
concerns about trade protectionism, global production grew
a further 4.6% to a new peak of 1.81 billion tonnes. In 2018,
China accounted for 52% of global steel production, East
Asia 11%, EU28 9%, NAFTA 7%, India 6%, CIS 5% and the
rest of the world 9%.

Chinese steel production data over the past few years has
been subject to increased uncertainty due to under-
reporting and the closure of illegal induction furnaces (IF)
around mid-2017. Since IF production was mostly
unrecorded in the official figures, as this production is
moved to mills whose production is recorded officially,
official production estimates are likely stronger than the
actual production output as estimated by ArcelorMittal.
Although the Company believes that the 2018 official steel
production in China of 928 million tonnes is broadly
accurate, ArcelorMittal believes that the growth rates
recorded by the World Steel Association of 7.8% in 2017
and, to a lesser extent the 6.6% growth recorded in 2018,
are higher than what occurred over this period.

World ex-China steel production has risen strongly since
2016 rising 4.8% in 2017 to 859 million tonnes and a further
2.5% in 2018 to 880 million tonnes. In 2017, production was
supported by double-digit growth of over 10% year-on-year
in Brazil, Egypt, Turkey and Vietnam. By major regions,
2017 production grew by 1.6% year-on-year in East Asia,
3.9% in EU28, 4.6% in North America, 6.3% in India,
decreased by 1.2% in CIS and increased by 13.1% in the
rest of the world. In contrast, production in 2018 increased
by 1.0% in East Asia, decreased 0.3% in EU28, and
increased 4.1% in North America, 4.9% in India, 0.3% in
CIS and 5.7% in the rest of the world. Production in East
Asia has returned to historic highs as intense competition
from excess capacity in China has eased, supported by
steady growth in global steel demand. Production growth in
EU28 has been curtailed by increased import penetration
despite continued demand growth and weakness in German
steel production. Stronger production growth in North
America has been driven by US fiscal stimulus and
supported by increasing trade protectionism, initially

focused on steel imports like the Section 232 tariffs.
Continued growth in Indian steel production reflects
continued industrialization supporting strong domestic steel
consumption growth. Weakness in CIS steel production is
due to persistent weakness in Ukrainian steel production
(the 2018 production of 21 million tonnes is a third below the
2011 peak of 35 million tonnes), despite historically high
Russian production of nearly 72 million tonnes in 2018.
After rising 13.1% to a record 37.5 million tonnes in 2017,
Turkish steel production fell slightly by 0.6% in 2018 due to
a balance of payment crisis caused by excessive economic
policy stimulus in 2017 and triggered by diplomatic tensions
with the United States.

Steel prices
Flat products

Steel prices for flat products in Europe improved during the
first quarter of 2016 compared to December 2015 levels. In
Northern Europe, the price for hot rolled coil ("HRC")
improved in the first quarter of 2016, with a similar trend in
Southern Europe. The second quarter of 2016 saw a sharp
increase in international steel prices, led by China, driving
an average increase of approximately €84/t quarter-on-
quarter in the North and €97/t in the South. The average
HRC prices for the first half of 2016 were at €371/t in
Northern Europe and €351/t in Southern Europe compared
to the first half of 2015, in which average HRC prices were
€405/t in the North and €394/t in the South. Steel prices
continued to increase in the third quarter and fourth quarter
of 2016.

Steel prices for flat products in Europe were stable in
Southern Europe and on a slight upward trend in Northern
Europe during the first quarter of 2017 compared to
December 2016. Prices of HRC increased in Northern
Europe by €69/t quarter-on-quarter and in Southern Europe
by €63/t quarter-on-quarter. Prices weakened in the second
quarter of 2017 with an average price decline of €47/t in
Europe. The average HRC prices for the first half of 2017
were at €545/t in Northern Europe and €513/t in Southern
Europe compared to the first half of 2016 as described
above. Prices bottomed out in July 2017, thus the
downtrend reversed during August and September 2017. In
the third quarter of 2017, spot HRC prices in Northern
Europe remained €5/t below the second quarter 2017
average, and in Southern Europe there was an average
increase of €9/t quarter-on-quarter.

There was little fluctuation in prices in the fourth quarter of
2017, with a quarter-on-quarter improvement of €22/t in
Northern Europe and €11/t in Southern Europe. HRC prices
during the second half of 2017 increased €65/t in Northern
Europe and €67/t in Southern Europe compared to the
second half of 2016.

In the first quarter of 2018, steel prices for flat products in
Europe continued their steady upward trend which started in
November 2017. HRC prices peaked towards the end of
March at €574/t in Northern Europe. In Southern Europe,
HRC prices increased from €519/t in January to €558/t at
the beginning of March. In the second quarter of 2018,
prices decreased sharply in USD terms following the
international market trend. However, the depreciation of the
euro against USD helped to sustain domestic HRC prices in
euro terms, with a low of €561/t in Northern Europe at the
beginning of June 2018, €14 below its peak in April 2018. In
Southern Europe, HRC prices bottomed out at €514/t by
mid-June 2018 from a peak of €544/t in April 2018. Average
HRC prices were €564/t in Northern Europe and €538/t in
Southern Europe for the first half of 2018, compared to
€545/t in Northern Europe and €513/t in Southern Europe
for the first half of 2017. The provisional safeguard
measures and tariff rate quotas implemented in July 2018
did not create a tangible effect on market protection in
Europe and there was very limited improvement in flat
products prices during the third quarter of 2018. In Northern
Europe HRC prices increased slightly in euro terms
compared to the June level but only to reach a quarterly
average of €566/t representing a €1/t decrease quarter-on-
quarter, while in Southern Europe the price improvement
averaged at €537/t representing a €7/t increase over the
second quarter level. In USD terms, however, prices
declined across the regions due to further euro depreciation
against USD. Market seasonality, high inventory levels and
imports pressured prices during the fourth quarter of 2018
and HRC prices declined in euro and USD terms both in
Northern Europe by €18/t to €548/t and in Southern Europe
by €38/t to €499/t compared to the third quarter 2018
average levels. Overall, the second half 2018 HRC prices
averaged at €557/t in Northern Europe and at €518/t in
Southern Europe, corresponding to a €30/t and €13/t year-
on-year increase, respectively.

In the United States, spot HRC prices increased during the
first quarter of 2016. The second quarter of 2016 had a
strong start and continued to strengthen for a quarter-on-
quarter improvement of approximately $184/t. The average
HRC price for the first half of 2016 in the United States was
$547/t as compared to an average of $541/t in the first half
of 2015. The spot HRC prices in the United States started to
decrease in July 2016 and continued this downward trend
until October 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, the
HRC price increased an average of $11/t quarter-on-quarter.
The spot HRC prices in the United States reached a low at
an average range of $526-552/t in October 2016, but then

Management report 15

sharply increased toward the end of the year. In the fourth
quarter of 2016, the spot HRC price in the United States
decreased approximately $64/t quarter-on-quarter. The
average spot HRC price in the second half of 2016 in the
United States was $618/t compared to an average of $467/t
in the second half of 2015.

In the United States, spot HRC prices increased during the
first quarter of 2017 by an average of $106/t quarter-on-
quarter. Price levels improved sharply during January, had
stability during February and peaked at $725/t by end of
March 2017, to reach their highest average level since
September 2014. During the second quarter of 2017, HRC
spot prices decreased $11/t quarter-on-quarter, with
progressive declines until the first week of June 2017, but
were followed by a price pickup, sustained by declining
inventories and improved international market sentiment.
The average HRC price in the United States during the first
half of 2017 was $688/t compared to the first half of 2016 at
$547/t. The HRC spot price slightly improved in July and
August, and stabilized towards the end of the third quarter
of 2017, increasing $4/t quarter-on-quarter. Slight declines
were recorded during October, but prices picked up during
November and December to reach $704/t by the end of
2017. The average prices during the fourth quarter of 2017
decreased $2/t quarter-on-quarter. Overall, in the second
half of 2017 prices averaged at $686/t, representing a $68/t
increase compared to the second half of 2016.

In the United States, as a consequence of the then-ongoing
Section 232 national security investigation which started in
April 2017 and the expectation of the imminent
implementation of import tariffs on steel, spot HRC prices
increased sharply during the first quarter of 2018. Before the
release of the investigation report by the Department of
Commerce on February 16, 2018, HRC prices reached
$830/t from $723/t at the beginning of January 2018. After
the release of the report that recommended tariffs in the
range of 24 to 53%, prices spiked further to $936/t at the
beginning of March 2018. The increase slowed down as
25% tariffs and exceptions went into effect during March
2018, closing the month at a high of $960/t. In the second
quarter of 2018, HRC prices surpassed the $1,000/t level in
the United States, peaking at $1,012/t by the end of June.
The average HRC prices were $907/t for the first half of
2018 in the United States, as compared to $688/t for the
first half of 2017, corresponding to a $219/t increase year-
on-year. HRC prices hit a 10 year high of $1,014/t at the
beginning of July 2018 in the United States. However,
market seasonality and weakening of the international
prices in the second part of the year coupled with an
increase in the domestic capacity utilization rate (thus an
increase in domestic supply), resulted in consistent price
deterioration, with HRC prices falling to $799/t by the end of
the year. Third quarter HRC prices averaged $982/t, still $2/t
above the second quarter level, while average prices
declined in the fourth quarter by $99/t quarter-on-quarter to

16 Management report

$883/t. Overall, average HRC prices for the second half of
2018 were $932/t as compared to $686/t for the second half
of 2017 corresponding to a $246/t increase year-on-year.

In China, spot HRC prices increased during the first quarter
of 2017, compared to the average levels of the fourth
quarter of 2016, fluctuating on an upward trend until the first
part of February 2017, but deteriorated afterwards, in line
with raw material basket cost decline. Domestic HRC prices
increased during the first quarter of 2017 by an average of
$35/t quarter-on-quarter. Prices continued to slide, hitting a
bottom level of $374/t, VAT excluded by mid-May, followed
however by a rapid recovery to a $439/t, VAT excluded
average in June, supported by a new upward trend in raw
materials cost, positive market sentiment and local mill
interest to ramp up production and maximize profits. HRC
spot prices decreased in the second quarter of 2017 on
average by $62/t quarter-on-quarter. In the first half 2017,
HRC domestic prices in China averaged $427/t, VAT
excluded, compared to $317/t, VAT excluded, during the first
half of 2016. HRC spot prices in China continued their
steady increase in the beginning of September and
increased for the third quarter of 2017 by $113/t quarter-on-
quarter. The price increases slowed down during the fourth
quarter of 2017 with an increase of $29/t quarter-on-quarter.
HRC spot prices in China averaged $523/t, VAT excluded in
the second half of 2017, an increase of $138/t, VAT
excluded from the second half of 2016.

In China, spot HRC prices fluctuated during the first quarter
of 2018, peaking at $562/t VAT excluded at the end of
February, followed by a sharp decline due to weak demand
and high inventories. HRC prices bottomed out at the end of
March at $507/t VAT excluded. Production cuts in several
regions and mill inspections to ensure compliance with
pollution emission standards impacted supply during the
second quarter of 2018. These measures supported HRC
prices in China, which increased from $524/t VAT excluded
at the beginning of April to a high of $581/t VAT excluded by
mid-June. However, due to improvements in production
levels and seasonal weak demand, HRC prices declined at
the end of the month. HRC domestic prices averaged $555/t
VAT excluded for the first half of 2018 in China, as
compared to $427/t VAT excluded for the first half of 2017.

Despite the implementation of tough environmental controls
and positive fiscal policies to expand domestic demand,
production continued to increase, sustained by attractive
margins, while consumption remained flat during the second
half of 2018. This resulted in further pressure on HRC prices
in China, which declined by $15/t (during the third quarter
2018) as compared to the second quarter average level to
$546/t VAT excluded and by an additional $58/t to $488/t
VAT excluded during the fourth quarter of 2018.

HRC domestic prices averaged $517/t VAT excluded in
China for the second half of 2018, representing a $7/t

decline as compared to $524/t VAT excluded for the second
half of 2017.

Long products

During the first quarter of 2016, long steel products saw a
quarter-on-quarter price decline in Europe for both medium
sections and rebar. This downward trend reversed during
the second quarter of 2016. The average medium sections
price for the first half of 2016 in Europe was €481/t
compared to €521/t for the first half of 2015. The average
rebar price in Europe for the first half of 2016 was €404/t
compared to €420/t for the first half of 2015. Long steel
product prices weakened again during the third quarter of
2016 for both medium sections and rebar. Prices reached a
low in October 2016, and started recovering through year
end, reaching an average of €511/t and €454/t in December
2016 for medium sections and rebar, respectively, although
the quarterly average prices remained down quarter-on-
quarter. The average medium sections price in Europe for
the second half of 2016 was €499/t as compared to €498/t
for the second half of 2015. The average rebar price in
Europe for the second half of 2016 was €432/t as compared
to €389/t for the second half of 2015.

Long steel product prices increased in Europe in the
beginning of the first quarter of 2017, followed by a decline
in mid-February, but with a recovery by the end of March.
Prices then weakened during the second quarter of 2017 for
both medium sections and rebars, but seemed to bottom out
by the end of June with a quarter on quarter decline of €15/t

and €22/t, respectively. The average price for medium
sections in Europe during the first half of 2017 was €508/t
compared to €481/t in the first half of 2016. The average
rebar price in Europe during the first half of 2017 was €452/t
compared to €404/t in the first half of 2016. Prices for long
steel products were on a steady upward trend toward the
end of the year. Medium sections prices increased €29/t
quarter-on-quarter, while rebar prices increased €28/t
quarter-on-quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2017,
medium sections prices further increased €58/t quarter-on-
quarter, while rebar prices increased €84/t quarter-on-
quarter. The average medium sections price in Europe for
the second half of 2017 was €557/t as compared to €499/t
for the second half of 2016. The average rebar price in
Europe for the second half of 2017 was €517/t as compared
to €432/t for the second half of 2016.

Long steel product prices remained relatively stable in
Europe in euro terms at the beginning of 2018 compared to
the peak level in December 2017, but continued their
upward trend in USD terms as the euro strengthened.
Prices weakened from mid-February and towards the end of
the first quarter 2018 with inventories reaching comfortable
levels and a cautious market following the volatility in raw
material costs. Medium sections prices declined from €625/t
in January to €600/t by the end of March. Similarly, rebar
prices declined from €568/t in January to €553/t in March.
Prices remained stable again during April 2018 but followed
a downward trend until mid-June when medium sections
bottomed out at €585/t and rebar at €528/t. Average
medium sections prices were €603/t in Europe for the first
half of 2018 as compared to an average of €508/t for the
first half of 2017. Average rebar prices were €552/t in
Europe for the first half of 2018 as compared to €452/t for
the first half of 2017. Good market sentiment and strong
demand supported an improvement of long product prices
during the third quarter of 2018, with medium sections
reaching €620/t and rebars €560/t by September
corresponding to a €35/t and €32/t increase, respectively, as
compared to the bottom level in June, and representing a
quarter-on-quarter average improvement of €20/t for
medium sections and €6 for rebars. Prices remained
relatively stable during the fourth quarter of 2018 as
compared to the levels at the end of September despite
some weakening in rebars with a quarterly average of €538/
trepresenting a €13/t decrease quarter-on-quarter. The
average medium sections prices were €618/t in Europe for
the second half of 2018 as compared to €557/t for the
second half of 2017. The average rebar prices were €545/t
in Europe for the second half of 2018 as compared to €517/t
for the second half of 2017.

With respect to scrap prices, in Turkey, even though the
average first quarter 2016 price of imported scrap HMS 1&2
at $194/t CFR showed a small improvement of about $6/t
against the average of the fourth quarter 2015, the average
price of March 2016 at $218/t CFR represented a month-on-

Management report 17

month increase of about $40/t. The Turkish rebar export
price followed a similar trend. The March 2016 export price
of Turkish rebar increased $44/t month-on-month. This
upward trend continued during the first two months of the
second quarter of 2016 with the export rebar price from
Turkey reaching an average range of $451-457/t FOB in
April, and $472-479/t FOB in May. In June 2016, rebar
prices reduced to an average range of $395-403/t FOB
Turkey. The average rebar export price from Turkey in the
first half of 2016 was $388/t FOB compared to the first half
of 2015, which was at $451/t FOB. The third quarter of 2016
average export price for Turkish rebar decreased followed
by improvements in the fourth quarter. The average rebar
export price for the second half of 2016 from Turkey was
$394/t FOB as compared to $361/t FOB for the second half
of 2015.

In the first quarter of 2017, imported scrap HMS 1&2 in
Turkey improved by $18/t compared to the fourth quarter of
2016 average of $275/t CFR. Rebar export prices followed
closely the evolution of Turkey imported Scrap HMS 1&2,
declining in the beginning of 2017 from $430/t FOB in
December 2016 to close to an average of $390/t FOB by
the end of January 2017, and continued fluctuating towards
the end of March 2017. However, Turkish rebar export
prices increased during the first quarter of 2017 by $14/t
quarter-on quarter. The price fluctuation continued during
the second quarter of 2017, but with an uptick towards the
end of June with an overall increase of $4/t over the
previous quarter. The average price in the first half of 2017
for rebar exported from Turkey was $425/t FOB compared
to $388/t FOB in the first half of 2016. From July through the
end of 2017, the Turkey rebar FOB price has been
fluctuating on an upward trend, closely following HMS 1&2
Turkey CFR price evolution. After hitting a three-year high of
$550/t FOB in the beginning of September 2017, rebar
prices declined to $508/t FOB by October. This drove an
increase in the average price range during the third quarter
of 2017 by $80/t quarter-on-quarter. Toward the end of
2017, the Turkey rebar FOB export price reached $570/t,
and further improved the quarterly average price by $20/t for
the fourth quarter of 2017. The average Turkey rebar export
price was $517/t FOB in the second half of 2017, an
increase of $123/t compared to $394/t FOB for the second
half of 2016.

In the first quarter of 2018, the price of imported scrap HMS
1&2 in Turkey improved by $40/t to an average level of
$363/t CFR as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Rebar export prices followed closely the evolution of Turkey
imported scrap HMS 1&2, declining from $573/t FOB at the
beginning of January to $555/t FOB by the end of the
month. Rebar export prices then increased to a peak of
$590/t FOB by the end of February followed by a downward
trend reaching $568/t FOB at the end of March. During the
second quarter of 2018, the Turkish export rebar price
continued to follow a downward trend alongside the scrap

HMS 1&2 index, ranging between $565/t FOB at the
beginning of April to $540/t FOB at the end of May. The
average Turkish export rebar price for the first half of 2018
was $562/t FOB, as compared to $425/t FOB for the first
half of 2017. With US and European markets blocked for
Turkish exporters due to EU safeguard measures and
doubling of the Section 232 import tariffs into the U.S.,
Turkish producers faced increased competition on
alternative markets resulting in further pressure on export
rebar prices during the first part of the third quarter. Prices
seemed to bottom out mid-August at $523/t; however they
continued to deteriorate during October to a $500/t level.
After a small uptick in November supported by an
improvement in scrap prices as well as a strengthening of
the Turkish Lira, Turkish export rebar prices dropped by the
end of the fourth quarter of 2018 to $455/t, the lowest level
since July 2017.

The average Turkish export rebar price for the second half
of 2018 was $507/t FOB, as compared to $518/t FOB for
the second half of 2017.

Current and anticipated trends in steel production and
prices

In China, in 2018, ArcelorMittal believes steel production
grew approximately 2.5% (despite the 6.6% increase in
Official figures - see discussion in "—Steel production"
above) as demand grew over 3%, yet exports declined by
8%. However, the Company expects production to be stable
to slightly down in 2019 as domestic demand contracts
around 1% offset by marginally higher exports. The Chinese
HRC spread (difference between raw material costs and
finished steel prices) in 2017 increased from approximately
$150/t in the first half of 2017 to $250/t in the second half
supported by an elevated crude steel utilization rate mainly

due to a structural steel capacity cut and the winter heating
season policy, which temporarily restricted steel supply. The
high Chinese HRC spread was sustained at around $255/t
in the first quarter of 2018 and increased to approximately
$280/t by the middle of the year supported by an elevated
crude steel utilization rate as demand was strong but
capacity constrained. The spread fell from October until the
end of the year to the level of $190-$195/t due to a lower
winter capacity constraint compared to last year and
negative sentiment on demand. The low spread has
continued into the beginning of 2019, but is expected to pick
up from March/April when the demand as well as positive
sentiment comes back to the market.

Led by a significant increase in pipe and tube demand, U.S.
ASC increased around 6% in 2017, which combined with
imports relatively stable at a high level, allowed domestic
production to increase as some capacity came back online.
ASC increased again in 2018 by almost 2%, and with
imports falling by around 10% due to the impact of the 25%
Section 232 tariffs, production increased by 6.2%. The
Company anticipates a small (1 to 2%) further increase in
steel demand in 2019, but with imports continuing to be
capped by tariffs, steel production is expected to grow ata
slightly stronger rate than demand. In the EU, steel demand
continues to grow slowly but imports have taken a larger
share of demand over the past couple of years. While
European mills output improved in 2017, crude steel output
was at best only stable in 2018 (decreasing by 0.4% year-
on-year) despite a 3% growth in ASC, as imports (especially
longs) continued to take market share, growing over 10%
year-on-year. In 2019, the Company expects much slower
growth in steel consumption, which is why the safeguards
measures on steel trade are important to enable European
mills to benefit from any improvement in demand.

Overall, ArcelorMittal expects world ex-China ASC to grow
again in 2019 due to strong demand growth in South
American and developing Asian markets and the waning
negative impact of declining Turkish steel demand, despite
slightly slower growth in developed markets. Continued
capacity restraint and relatively stable production in China,
together with continued growth in demand in world ex-China
should lead to a gradual improvement in utilization and
support the spread of steel prices over raw material costs.

Raw materials

The primary raw material inputs for a steelmaker are iron
ore, coking coal, solid fuels, metallics (e.g., scrap), alloys,
electricity, natural gas and base metals. ArcelorMittal is
exposed to price volatility in each of these raw materials
with respect to its purchases in the spot market and under
its long-term supply contracts. In the longer term, demand
for raw materials is expected to continue to correlate closely
with the steel market, with prices fluctuating according to
supply and demand dynamics. Since most of the minerals
used in the steel-making process are finite resources, they
may also rise in response to any perceived scarcity of
remaining accessible supplies, combined with the evolution
of the pipeline of new exploration projects to replace
depleted resources.

Throughout 2016, raw material prices became increasingly
volatile and impacted by short-term changes in sentiment,
mainly related to Chinese market demand sentiment for
crude steel and how the government might deal with excess
steelmaking capacity. Iron ore and coking coal prices
increased by 5.1% and 58.2% year-on-year respectively in
2016 (Metal Bulletin 2016 vs. 2015). The increase in the
average reference iron ore and hard coking coal price
continued in 2017 due to the impact of induction furnaces
capacities closures since 2016. In 2017, iron ore and coking
coal prices increased by 22.3% and 31.5% year-on-year
respectively (Metal Bulletin 2017 vs. 2016). In 2018, strong
steel production in China amid its fight against air pollution
and overcapacity kept iron ore and coking coal prices at
elevated levels and boosted prices for high-grade qualities
as steel mills chased productivity. Though prices for the
most common qualities of iron ore decreased 2.2% year-on-
year in 2018, the high-grade qualities of iron ore posted a
price increase on an annual basis. Coking coal prices
increased 10.3% compared to 2017 (Metal Bulletin 2018 vs.
2017).

As for pricing mechanisms, since 2012, quarterly and
monthly pricing systems have been the main type of
contract pricing mechanisms, but spot purchases also
appear to have gained a greater share as steelmakers have
developed strategies to benefit from increasing spot market
liquidity and volatility. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the trend for
using shorter-term pricing cycles continued. Pricing is
generally linked to market price indexes and uses a variety
of mechanisms, including current spot prices and average
prices over specified periods. Therefore, there may not be a
direct correlation between market reference prices and
actual selling prices in various regions at a given time.

Iron ore

After reaching $39.50/t (delivered to China Metal Bulletin
Index 62% Fe) on January 13, 2016 and averaging $48.70/t
for first quarter of 2016, iron ore market reference prices
reached a low during the first quarter of 2016. During the

Management report 19

second quarter of 2016, the average price was $55.50/t and
the period was marked by high volatility, with a peak at
$70.50/t on April 21, 2016 and a low of $48.18/t on June 2,
2016. For the third quarter of 2016, the average was
$58.40/t with a slight downward trend throughout
September. During the fourth quarter of 2016, it increased
from a minimum of $55.86/t on October 4, 2016 and
reached a maximum of $83.58/t on December 12, 2016, the
average for the fourth quarter was of $70.50/t and was
marked by high volatility and bullish market sentiment driven
by higher steel prices as well as closure announcements by
the Chinese authorities in steelmaking based on obsolete
induction furnaces using mostly scrap as raw materials.

Iron ore prices recovered to $85.60/t in the first quarter of
2017 following strong demand for steel after the Chinese
New Year. The average price for the second quarter of 2017
decreased to $62.90/t; this downward trend was influenced
by increased inventory levels at Chinese ports. In the third
quarter of 2017, the average price increased to $71.20/t
driven by bullish sentiment in the steel market reflected in
strong steel PMIs (Purchasing Manager Index) for China.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the price varied from a
minimum of $58.52/t on October 31, 2017 and a maximum
of $76.36/t December 22, 2017, with the average for the
fourth quarter at $65.50/t. The quarter was marked by high
volatility driven by environmental regulation announcements
by the Chinese authorities to constrain emissions and steel
production during the 2017-2018 winter period.

In the first quarter of 2018 iron ore prices recovered at
$74.39/t, up 13.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
However, great price disparities were observed. Seaborne
iron ore demand was hit by a persistent weakness in
downstream steel demand, the trade war developing
between China and the U.S. and the extension of winter
restrictions in China beyond March 15, 2018 all of which
had a significant impact. In March, prices plummeted from
the highest quarter price of $79.39/t in the beginning of the
month to $64.99/t at the end of the month (Metal Bulletin
2017 & 2018). In the second quarter of 2018, prices
decreased and remained stable at an average $65.30/t
despite strong steel demand over the period. China iron ore
port stocks remained high and concentrate production
sharply decreased year-over-year as a result of mine
inspections. However, steel PMI remained in expansion at
51.6 points in June. In the third quarter, prices were fairly
stable, averaging $66.8/t. Low prices on the seaborne
market found support in the fear of an intensification of the
trade war between China and the U.S., depreciation of the
Chinese currency, low future prices and environmental
restriction in China. The last quarter of 2018 saw the iron
ore price jumping and averaging $71.6/t. It reached $76.75/t
on November 12, 2018 amid strong steel margins depleting
stocks at Chinese ports and restocking demand in China
before the start of the winter period. Also, the derailment of
a BHP train carrying iron ore in Australia in the beginning of

20 Management report

November provided some short-term support to the iron ore
price that boosted the November average. However, prices
dropped at the end of November, and in the beginning of
December, mills corrected for weak off-season demand and
reduced steel margins due to less stringent winter
restrictions, which led to prices at the end of 2018 at $72.70/
t

Coking coal

In 2016, the spot price (Metal Bulletin Premium Hard Coking
Coal FOB Australia index) traded on average at $78.90/t in
the first quarter with the market contract price (price settled
between major steel producers and suppliers) settling at
$81/t for the same quarter; then the second quarter of 2016
had a contract settlement fixed at $84/t with the spot
average for that quarter at $90.40/t while the third quarter
had a market contract price settled at $92.50/t and the spot
index traded between $90.20/t and $94.80/t for the first 15
days but averaged $131.50/t for the third quarter. During the
fourth quarter of 2016, the spot price reached a maximum of
$308.80/t on November 11, 2016 and decreased through
the closing of the year to $231/t on December 30, 2016. The
average spot price for the fourth quarter of 2016 was
$265.80/t with quarterly market contract prices settled at
$200/t. The highly volatile spot index over the second half of
2016 was influenced by the Chinese domestic supply
reduction (originating from weather/logistic issues combined
with regulations issued by the Chinese government on lower
mining working days, from an annual rate of 330 days per
year to a lower rate at 276 days, with temporary relief as
described above) as well as several maintenance and
mining operational issues in Australian coking coal mines
during that period. Consequently, the premium HCC FOB
Australia quarterly market contract price was settled at
$200/t for the fourth quarter of 2016 and at $285/t for the
first quarter of 2017.

In the first quarter of 2017, the spot prices (Metal Bulletin
Premium Hard Coking Coal FOB Australia index) sharply
dropped from $266.50/t in December 2016 (monthly
average) to $155.20/t in March 2017 (monthly average) with
the average spot price for the first quarter at $166.80/t. The
temporary relief of the Chinese working days restriction and
fully recovered supply from Australia, as well as expected
additional seaborne supply from North America allowed
such a sharp drop in prices by the end of the first quarter of
2017. At the beginning of the second quarter of 2017, the
cyclone Debbie that unexpectedly hit Australia caused
supply disruptions and spot prices spiked. The upward trend
of April up to $300/t on April 18, 2017 and a monthly
average of $257.80/t was followed by the downward trend in
May and June as the Australia mining-rail-port system
recovered earlier than expected from the cyclone disruption.
The spot price decreased through the second quarter to
$175/t in May (monthly average) and $145/t in June 2017
(monthly average), leading to an average spot price for the
second quarter of 2017 of $190.60/t.

For the second quarter of 2017, a new index-based
methodology was adopted for the premium HCC FOB
Australia quarterly contract price between some Japanese
steel makers and Australian HCC suppliers. In the third
quarter of 2017, the average spot price (Metal Bulletin
Premium Hard Coking Coal FOB Australia index) increased
to $188.30/t driven by bullish sentiment in the steel market
and strong steel PMIs for China. In the fourth quarter,
supported by the port congestion in Australia, the price
further increased to $203.50/t.

Coking coal prices entered 2018 as a bullish market with
record high vessel queues at a key port in Queensland,
Australia and Chinese restocking demand high ahead of the
Chinese New Year holiday. The spot prices (Metal Bulletin
Premium Hard Coking Coal FOB Australia index) averaged
$228/t in the first quarter of 2018 increasing 36.8% year-on-
year and 12.2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
The elevated prices were then corrected in the second
quarter and reached $189/t (quarterly average) due to the
extension of Chinese winter restrictions until April and
delayed increase of steel demand in China. However, the
downward movement was limited by a continued threat of
supply disruptions due to Aurizon’s announced change in
the maintenance plan at its rail system in Australia, and
safety check at Chinese mines. The price also found
support from Chinese coke prices as domestic coke
producers faced environmental crackdowns. In the third
quarter, coking coal prices averaged $184/t and $183/t in
July and August respectively with no major supply disruption
and less demand during Indian monsoon season. The
prices rose again in September to $198/t with demand from
strong steel production in China amid healthy margins and
tight supply of low-Sulphur coking coal in the Chinese
domestic market. Prices kept on increasing in the last
quarter on the back of strong steel production and threat of
supply issues from scheduled maintenance at key
Australian ports which increased port queues again to the
record levels seen at the end of 2017. The bullish sentiment
found support from the breakout of a fire at one Australian
mine, rendering it idle for at least six months. The coking
coal spot prices increased to a quarterly average of $221/t
in the fourth quarter of 2018.

ArcelorMittal has continued to leverage its iron ore and
coking coal supply chain and diversified supply portfolio as
well as the flexibility provided by contractual terms to
mitigate regional supply disruptions and also mitigate part of
the market price volatility.

Scrap

Both Eurofer and German Wirtschaftsvereinigung (“WV”)
indexes were discontinued as of January 1, 2016. The
German suppliers’ index (“BDSV”) is now used and
converted into Delivered at Place (“DAP”), in order to be
comparable with historical figures.

During 2018, the German suppliers’ index “BDSV” for
reference grade E3 was quite stable starting in January
2018 at €290.58/t and reached a yearly maximum of
€293.98/t in March 2018. The index dropped continuously
until December 2018 down to €279.99/t as Turkey's
requirements for EU scrap decreased at the end of 2018.
HMS 1&2 North Europe followed a similar trend starting in
January 2018 at €294/t and reached a yearly high of €297/t
in March 2018. Unlike the German BDSV index, there were
up and down movements from April throughout the rest of
the year but the general trend remained down and the HMS
1&2 North Europe ended the year at €238/t in December
2018. European scrap price parity with exports continues.
The European E3 price moved following HMS and
exchange rate fluctuation. The European E3 price was $4/t
below, $4/t above, $8/t above and $8/t below HMS in the
first, second, third and fourth quarter of 2018, respectively,
but the European E3 price and HMS were at the same
average levels in 2018.

Turkey remained the main scrap buying country in the
international market in 2018, with approximately 69% of its
steel production based on the EAF process, with the other
31% through the blast furnace route, similar to its production
in 2017. In 2016, the percentage of Turkey's steel
production through the EAF process and blast furnaces was
66% and 34% respectively. Steel production in Turkey
stagnated in 2018 at the same level as 2017 after a 15%

Management report 21

increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 and a 5.2% increase
in 2016 as compared to 2015. There was a significant
reduction of imported billets, which dropped by 46% in 2018
as compared to 2017, following a 50.1% decrease in 2017
as compared to 2016 and a 1.4% increase in 2016 as
compared to 2015. As Turkish scrap import volumes
increased in 2018 as compared to 2017 at 21 million
tonnes, the decrease in billet imports was compensated by
local scrap which increased by 7% year-on-year. In 2017,
scrap imports into Turkey increased by 19% compared to
2016, with scrap imports totaling 17.7 million tonnes
representing an 8.6% increase as compared to the same
period in 2015.

In the domestic US market, average scrap prices increased
by 20% or $53/t in 2018 as compared to a $61/t increase in
2017, which represented a 29% increase as compared to
2016. The Midwest Index for HMS 1 increased from an
average of 208$/t in 2016 to $269/t in 2017 and $322/t in
2018. On the export market, East Coast FOB average
prices increased by $40/t from $280/t in 2017 to $320/t in
2018.

Ferro alloys and base metals
Ferro alloys

The underlying price driver for manganese alloys is the
price of manganese ore which was at the level of $7.16 per
dry metric tonne unit (“dmt”) (for 44% lump ore) on Cost,
Insurance and Freight (“CIF”) China for 2018, representing
a 20% increase from $5.97/dmt in 2017 ($4.30/dmt in 2016)
mainly due to sustained demand of manganese ore from
China, reflecting appetite showed by manganese alloys
producers.

The prices of high carbon ferro manganese decreased by
7% from $1,428/t in 2017 to $1,330/t in 2018 ($960/t in
2016). Prices of silicon manganese decreased by 8% from
$1,343/t in 2017 to $1,235/t in 2018 ($992/t for 2016).
Finally, prices for medium carbon ferro manganese
stagnated (+1%) in 2018 at $1,930/t as compared to
$1,910/t in 2017 ($1,376/t for 2016).

Base metals

Base metals used by ArcelorMittal are zinc, tin and
aluminum for coating, aluminum for deoxidization of liquid
steel and nickel for producing stainless or special steels.
ArcelorMittal partially hedges its exposure to its base metal
inputs in accordance with its risk management policies.

The average price of zinc for 2018 was $2,926/t,
representing a 1% increase as compared to the 2017
average of $2,896/t (the 2016 average was $2,095/t).
Stocks registered at the London Metal Exchange (“LME”)
warehouses stood at 129,325 tonnes as of December 31,
2018, representing a 29% decrease compared to December

22 Management report

31, 2017 when registered stocks stood at 182,050 tonnes
(427,850 tonnes in 2016).

The average price of tin for 2018 was $20,167/t, slightly
above the 2017 average of $20,098/t (the 2016 average
was $18,006/t).

The average price of aluminum for 2018 was $2,110/t,
representing a 7% increase compared to the 2017 average
of $1,968/t (the 2016 average was $1,605/t).

The average price of nickel for 2018 was $13,118/t,
representing an 26% increase compared to the 2017
average of $10,407/t (the 2016 average was $9,609/t).

Ocean freight

Ocean freight prices increased in 2018 compared to 2017
primarily due to a lack of dry bulk net fleet growth and a flat
demand trend, after increasing in 2017 as well. The Baltic
Dry Index (“BDI”) averaged 1,352 points against 1,145
points in 2017, an 18% increase year-on-year. The
Capesize index increased by 9% year-on-year to average
16,529$/day against 15,129$/day in 2017 (7,388$/day in
2016). Meanwhile the Panamax index increased by 19% to
average 11,654$/day against 9,766$/day in 2017 (5,562$/
day in 2016). Dry bulk fleet growth has been slow because
of a lack of deliveries which was due to vessels not being
contracted in the low market of 2016. In 2018, new build
deliveries reached the lowest rate of deliveries in the last 10
years, which helped to restrict supply. Due to the market
being stronger than in previous years, demolition of ships
reduced. Net fleet growth was 2.8% in 2018 compared to
2.9% in 2017. Demand of dry cargo was flat in 2018
affected by global political instability and disruptions. The
U.S.-China trade tensions created uncertainty in the market
while logistical disruptions (like BHP’s train derailment in
Australia and leaks in Anglo American’s Minas Rio pipeline)
constricted the supply of cargo in the second half of the
year. Chinese imports were down year-on-year for the first
time in 7 years. Chinese coal imports were positive in the
first half of 2018 but saw a downturn in the second half as
the Chinese government's policy preferred domestic
production over imports. Year-on-year dry bulk trade growth
was 2.3% in 2018 as compared to 4.1% in 2017.

The industry is preparing for the new sulphur cap on marine
fuels set by the International Maritime Organization that will
apply from 2020 onwards. Ship owners need to decide
whether to install air pollution control devices known as
scrubbers which will allow owners to continue using dirty
marine fuel or waive the installation and use the more
expensive cleaner marine fuel oil. This will have an impact

on supply and potentially pricing (as shipowners attempt to
pass on the increased costs) dynamics from 2019 onwards.

Impact of exchange rate movements

Because a substantial portion of ArcelorMittal’s assets,
liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar (its reporting currency),
ArcelorMittal has exposure to fluctuations in the values of
these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. These currency
fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro, as well as fluctuations in the currencies
of the other countries in which ArcelorMittal has significant
operations and sales, can have a material impact on its
results of operations. For example, ArcelorMittal’s non-U.S.
subsidiaries may purchase raw materials, including iron ore
and coking coal, in U.S. dollars, but may sell finished steel
products in other currencies. Consequently, an appreciation
of the U.S. dollar will increase the cost of raw materials;
thereby having a negative impact on the Company’s
operating margins, unless the Company is able to pass
along the higher cost in the form of higher selling prices. In
order to minimize its currency exposure, ArcelorMittal enters
into hedging transactions to lock-in a set exchange rate, as
per its risk management policies.

In 2016, the outcome of the Brexit referendum triggered a
move toward safety trades that prompted U.S. dollar
strength, supporting the trend towards lower interest rates in
the G10 countries. This climate was confirmed later with the
U.S. presidential campaign; however, a sharp reversal of
market sentiment followed Donald Trump’s election,
triggered by the expectation of an ambitious fiscal and
investment program. As a consequence, the euro
depreciated against the U.S. dollar to 1.0541 at the end of
2016 from 1.0898 at the start of the year, further driven by
the reduction of the monthly asset purchase program from
the European Central Bank.

In 2017, the fluctuations on the foreign exchange markets
were broadly driven by the activity of central banks that
started to reduce their accommodative monetary policies,
including the U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Federal Reserve"),
which increased rates three times during the year. The less
accommodative policies adopted by the European Central
Bank (“ECB”), Bank of Canada (“BoC”) and Bank of
England (“BoE”) were already anticipated by the markets
and their respective currencies strengthened even before
the banks' monetary decisions. The euro strengthened
significantly against the U.S. dollar, from 1.0541 at the
beginning of 2017 to 1.1993 at the end of the year.

In 2018, the Company designated a portfolio of euro
denominated debt (€5.2 billion as of December 31, 2018) as
a hedge of certain euro denominated investments (€7.8
billion as of December 31, 2018) in order to mitigate the
foreign currency risk arising from certain euro denominated
subsidiaries net assets. The risk arises from the fluctuation
in spot exchange rates between EUR/USD, which causes
the amount of the net investments to vary. See also note 6.3
to the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
hedge designation, foreign exchange gains and losses
related to the portfolio of euro denominated debt are
recognized in other comprehensive income.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company is mainly subject to
foreign exchange exposure relating to the euro, Brazilian
real, Canadian dollar, Indian rupee, Kazakhstani tenge,
South African rand, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Argentine
peso and Ukrainian hryvnia against the U.S. dollar resulting
from its trade payables and receivables.

In 2018, the protectionism of the U.S. administration in its
trade policies and the monetary policy divergence between
the United States and G10 countries led to the global
appreciation of the U.S. dollar. While the Federal Reserve
increased rates from 2.25% to 3.00% in 2018, the ECB
announced the end of its quantitative easing program and
kept rates on hold. Therefore, the euro depreciated from
1.19 at the start of 2018 to 1.14 at the end of the year.

Elsewhere in Europe, the Czech central bank’s rate
increase failed to support the Czech koruna in 2018. The
Czech central bank was forced to tighten its policy ata
faster pace to offset the loosening effect stemming from the
Czech koruna's weakness. The Czech koruna weakened
from 21.29 against the U.S. dollar on December 31, 2017 to
22.47 on December 31, 2018. In Poland, the national
central bank maintained the reference rate unchanged at a
record-low level of 1.50%, even though some members of
the current monetary policy council voted for a rate increase
at the November meeting for the first time since 2015. The
Polish zloty weakened against the U.S. dollar at the end of
2018 to 3.76 compared to 3.48 at the beginning of the year.

In Ukraine, contrary to most other emerging markets
currencies, the Ukrainian hryvnia appreciated by 6% against
the U.S. dollar during the first half of 2018. As the economy
did not show any signs of real improvement, this
appreciation was probably the result of certain speculative
flows. The second half of the year was marked by a tense
geopolitical environment and domestic politics. As a
consequence, the hryvnia erased the appreciation of the
first half of the year and ended 2018 at 27.69 against the
U.S. dollar.

In Kazakhstan, after a strong start of the year due to an
increase in oil output with the launch of the Kashagan field,
the expansion lost steam on slowing growth and trade
disputes with Russia. The tenge came under renewed

Management report 23

depreciation pressure, preventing inflation from slowing and
prompting the national central bank to keep interest rates on
hold. The tenge depreciated against the U.S. dollar and
reached its weakest level in December 2018 at 384.17.

In India, the balance of payments deficit weighed on the
Indian rupee, which depreciated by 15% versus the U.S.
dollar from January 2018 to October 2018. However, the
decrease in oil prices since October 2018 was particularly
beneficial for India's external finances. The Indian rupee
weakened against the U.S. dollar from 63.87 at the start of
the year to 69.63 in December 2018. In October 2018, the
Company entered into hedging programs including non
deliverable forwards and non deliverable options for a total
nominal amount of $5.9 billion in order to hedge the volatility
between Indian Rupee and U.S. dollar in relation to the
proposed acquisition of ESIL.See note 6.3 to the
consolidated financial statements for further information.

South Africa exited its first half 2018 recession in the third
quarter, expanding at an annualized pace of 2.2% quarter
on quarter. Strong improvements in manufacturing,
agriculture and services were partly offset by weakness in
mining. In response to flagging growth, the government
announced an economic recovery and stimulus plan in
September 2018. Key proposals included visa reform to
boost tourism and high-skilled immigration, implementing
the mining charter, a new infrastructure fund, telecoms
reform, and reviewing administered prices. The South
African rand depreciated from 12.40 against the U.S. dollar
at the beginning of the year to 14.43 in December 2018.

In North America, another trade battle took place as the
United States, Canada and Mexico tried to reshape the
North American Free Trade Agreement. The Canadian
dollar and the Mexican peso were first weighed down by
negative headlines regarding the negotiations and then
supported by news suggesting that an agreement could be
achieved. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement
(“USMCA") was announced on October 1, 2018. Despite the
announcement of this trade agreement, the Canadian dollar
finally weakened against the U.S. dollar in the context of
lower oil prices and risk aversion from 1.2540 in December
2017 to 1.3629 at the end of 2018. In Mexico, the
appreciation of the Mexican peso following the
announcement of the USMCA was softened by the new
government's decision to cancel the Mexico City airport
project at Texcoco. The Mexican peso ended 2018 at 19.64
against the U.S. dollar, only 0.6% below its level at the
beginning of the year.

In Brazil, the real depreciated from 3.31 to 4.17 against the
U.S dollar between January and August 2018, in line with
fluctuations of other emerging markets currencies. Optimism
rose following the election of Jair Bolsonaro. The new
president organized an economic cabinet with the
nomination of Finance Minister Paulo Guedes. The Brazilian
real strengthened and reached 3.87 in December 2018.

In Argentina, the Argentinian peso was subject to a very
strong depreciation during the third quarter of 2018 versus
the U.S dollar. When President Macri asked the IMF to
speed up payments, the Argentinian peso lost more than
36% of its value. In a chain reaction, inflation has increased
significantly since early 2018 and the three-year cumulative
inflation rate has exceeded 100%. Argentina is now
considered as a hyperinflationary economy. Inflation slowly
decreased at the end of 2018; however, the current situation
in addition to the 2019 general election have led to high
volatility of the Argentinian currency. Starting at 18.65
against the U.S. dollar at the beginning of 2018, the
Argentinian peso finished the year at 37.70. See note 2.2.2
to the consolidated financial statements for further
information.

On February 17, 2016, the Venezuelan government
devalued its currency by changing the official rate of the
bolivar fuerte from 6.3 to 10 per U.S. dollar. It also
announced the elimination of the SICAD rate and starting
February 18, 2016, the SIMADI rate (renamed DICOM) was
allowed to float freely at a rate of approximately 203 bolivar
fuerte per U.S. dollar. The DICOM rate was originally set at
206 bolivars per U.S. dollar on March 10, 2016, before
falling to 674 bolivars per U.S. dollar at December 31, 2016.
The DICOM rate continued to weaken during 2017 to 3,345
bolivars per U.S. dollar on August 31, 2017, when the
Venezuelan government temporarily suspended the sale of
U.S. dollars through its DICOM auction system. Effective
January 30, 2018, the Venezuelan government eliminated
the DIPRO rate and reopened the DICOM auction system
auction on February 5, 2018 at the new DICOM rate of
30,987 bolivars per euro (25,000 bolivars per U.S. dollar).
DICOM is now the country’s only official exchange rate. On
August 20, 2018, the bolivar soberano ("VES") replaced the
bolivar fuerte ("VEF") at a rate of 1 VES to 100,000 VEF.
The VES continued to weaken and reached 638.16 against
the U.S. dollar on December 31, 2018. See note 2.2.2 to the
consolidated financial statements for further information.

Trade and import competition
Europe!

A slowdown in global steel consumption coupled with
excess capacity in China led to increased finished steel
shipments into Europe in 2015, with import penetration
rising to over 16% in 2018. Since then Chinese imports into
Europe have fallen back from a peak of 7 million tonnes in
2015 to around 3 million tonnes in 2018. However, this has
been more than offset by an increase in imports from Turkey
(up from 2 million tonnes in 2015 to 7 million tonnes in
2018) and Developed Asia (2 million tonnes in 2014 to 5
million tonnes in 2018). Meanwhile, CIS imports have
remained the largest share but have been relatively stable
between 7 and 8 million tonnes since 2014. Overall, this

continued a trend of imports growing more strongly than
domestic demand. Between 2012 and 2018, Apparent Steel
Consumption (“ASC”) increased by 18% while over the
same period, finished steel imports increased by over
100%, taking market share from domestic producers. Over
this period total finished imports have risen from just over 15
million tonnes in 2012 to over 31 million tonnes in 2018,
causing import penetration to rise to a record high of almost
20%. Import penetration in flats rose strongly from 2012
(13%) to 2015 (20%). While import penetration in flats has
risen slowly since 2015 (up to 22% in 2018), the significant
increase recently has been in long products, where import
penetration rose to 13% in 2018 up from only 10% the
previous year. See “Risks related to the global economy and
the mining and steel industry". Unfair trade practices in
ArcelorMittal’s home markets could negatively affect steel
prices and reduce ArcelorMittal’s profitability, while trade
sanctions and barriers may have an adverse effect on
ArcelorMittal’s operations in various markets.”

United States!

Finished steel imports peaked in 2014 at almost 30 million
tonnes, declining to below 23 million tonnes in 2016 (or an
import penetration of 25%). Imports in 2017 rose 12% year-
on-year to around 25.5 million tonnes or an import
penetration of over 26%. However, finished steel import
penetration fell in 2018 to 23% as finished imports fell by
12% compared to a 2% year-on-year increase in ASC.
Imports of semi-finished steel products continued to rise
strongly, up by 11% year-on-year in 2018 after an increase
of 28% during 2017.

Steel import penetration in 2018 fell back to 23%, close to
the average between 2007 and 2013 and much lower than
the 28% average import penetration between 2014 and
2016. The decrease in finished steel imports was due to
increasing U.S. trade protection measures, despite
attractive prices in the U.S. relative to international markets.

In 2018 over a third of imports came from Canada (25%)
and Mexico (9%), up from around 29% in 2017. Imports
from the rest of the world took a declining share, with 20%
of U.S. steel imports coming from developed Asia (down
17% year-on-year), 18% from EU28 (up 1% year-on-year),
5% from Turkey (down 43% year-on-year), 3% from CIS
(down 25% year-on-year) and 3% from China (down 10%
year-on-year). In 2018, imports only significantly increased
from ASEAN (up 13% year-on-year) taking a 5% share,
mainly from Vietnam.

Consolidation in the steel and mining industries

Prior to 2017, consolidation transactions had decreased
significantly in terms of number and value in the context of
economic uncertainties in developed economies combined
with a slowdown in emerging markets.

However, in an effort to reduce the worldwide structural
overcapacity, some key consolidation steps were
undertaken in 2018 and 2017, specifically in China and in
Europe.

Steel industry consolidation in China has remained slow
since 2012. As a key initiative of the Chinese central
government's five-year plan issued in March 2011, the
concentration process of the steel industry was expected to
reduce overcapacity, rationalize steel production based on
obsolete technology, improve energy efficiency, achieve
environmental targets and strengthen the bargaining
position of Chinese steel companies in price negotiations for
iron ore. However, that initiative is yet to produce significant
tangible results. In 2015, China dropped its target objective
for the top ten Chinese steel producers to account for 60%
of national production and for at least two producers to
reach 100 million tonne capacity in the next few years. A
new industry consolidation plan published by China aims at
simplifying approval procedures and facilitating acquisition
financing for firms in sectors like steel. In late 2016,
Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel Group
completed their merger, creating Baowu Steel Group with
an annual production capacity of around 60 million tonnes,
also making it the world's second largest steelmaker.

In Europe, 2018 was a landmark year for the consolidation
of the steel industry with two major transactions. Following
an announcement made in September 2017, Tata Steel and
Thyssenkrupp signed a final agreement at the end of June
2018 to consolidate their European steel mills and create
the joint venture Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, Europe's second-
largest steel company after ArcelorMittal. The transaction is
subject to merger control clearance in several jurisdictions,
including the European Union.

In addition, on November 1, 2018, ArcelorMittal completed
the acquisition of Ilva, Europe's largest single steel site and
only integrated steelmaker in Italy with its main production
facility based in Taranto. Ilva also has significant steel
finishing capacity in Taranto, Novi Ligure and Genova. The
transaction was approved by the European Commission on

Management report 25

May 7, 2018 subject to the disposal of certain assets in Italy,
Romania, North Macedonia, the Czech Republic,
Luxembourg and Belgium, for which ArcelorMittal submitted
sales offers currently reviewed by the European
Commission. See Key transactions and events in 2018.

In the first quarter of 2018, ArcelorMittal signed a joint
venture formation agreement with NSSMC in relation to its
offer for a competitive resolution plan for ESIL in India
setting out a positive future for the bankrupt company, an
integrated flat steel producer and the largest steel company
in western India. The updated plan would enable ESIL to
participate in anticipated steel demand growth in India.
Further to ArcelorMittal being named the preferred bidder in
October 2018, ESIL's committee of creditors announced in
October that the Company has been identified as the
successful applicant. ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan remains
subject to the approval of India's NCLT. See Key
transactions and events in 2018.

Further future consolidation should allow the steel industry
to perform more consistently through industry cycles by
achieving greater efficiencies and economies of scale, and
improve bargaining power with customers and, crucially,
suppliers, who tend to have higher levels of consolidation.

Critical accounting policies and use of judgments and
estimates

Management's discussion and analysis of ArcelorMittal’s
operational results and financial condition is based on
ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS
recognition and measurement principles and, in particular,
making the critical accounting judgments highlighted below
require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. Management reviews its estimates on an
ongoing basis using currently available information.
Changes in facts and circumstances or obtaining new
information or more experience may result in revised
estimates, and actual results could differ from those
estimates.

An overview of ArcelorMittal's critical accounting policies
under which significant judgments, estimates and
assumptions are made may be found in note 1.2 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Sales

ArcelorMittal had sales of $76.0 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018, representing a 10.7% increase from
sales of $68.7 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017, primarily due to a 13.5% increase in the average steel
selling prices, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in steel
shipments. In the first half of 2018, sales were $39.2 billion
increasing from sales of $33.3 billion in the first half of 2017,
primarily due to 16.7% higher average steel selling prices.
In the second half of 2018, sales of $36.8 billion
represented a 4.2% increase as compared to sales of $35.3
billion in the second half of 2017, primarily driven by a
10.6% increase in average steel selling prices, partially
offset by a 4.5% decrease in steel shipments.

ArcelorMittal had sales of $68.7 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017, representing a 20.9% increase from
sales of $56.8 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016, primarily due to a 20.4% increase in the average steel
selling prices, a 1.6% increase in steel shipments, 22.3%
higher seaborne iron ore reference prices and 6.1% higher
marketable iron ore shipments. In the first half of 2017,
sales were $33.3 billion increasing from sales of $28.1
billion in the first half of 2016, primarily due to 23% higher
average steel selling prices and 43% higher seaborne iron
ore reference prices. In the second half of 2017, sales of

driven by a 17.5% increase in average steel selling prices, a
5.8% increase in steel shipments and a 6% increase in
seaborne iron ore reference prices

Cost of sales

Cost of sales consists primarily of purchases of raw
materials necessary for steel-making (iron ore, coke and
coking coal, scrap and alloys), electricity, repair and
maintenance costs, as well as direct labor costs,
depreciation and impairment. Cost of sales for the year
ended December 31, 2018 was $67.0 billion as compared to
$60.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017,
primarily due to a 9.4% increase in raw material costs
(consistent with the increase in sales) and impairment
charges of $1.0 billion primarily related to the remedy asset
sales in connection with the Ilva acquisition and the agreed
remedy package required for the approval of the Votorantim
acquisition, partially offset by the $0.2 billion in gain from a
bargain purchase recognized with respect to the acquisition
of Ilva. Selling, general and administrative expenses
(“SG&A”) were $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31,
2018 compared to $2.4 billion for the year ended December
31, 2017. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased for the
year ended December 31, 2018 (3.2%) as compared to
2017 (3.4%).

Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was
$60.9 billion as compared to $50.4 billion for the year ended

Management report 27

December 31, 2016, primarily due to a 22.3% increase in
iron ore reference prices, a 31.5% increase in coal
reference prices and impairment charges of $206 million
related to a downward revision of cash flow projections
across all steel facilities in South Africa partially offset by
cost optimization efforts as part of the Action 2020 plan.
SG&A were $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017 compared to $2.2 billion for the year ended December
31, 2016. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased for the

2016 (3.9%).

Operating income

ArcelorMittal’s operating income for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was $6.5 billion as compared with an
operating income of $5.4 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and was primarily driven by improved
operating conditions (positive price-cost effect in the steel
segments), offset in part by the impact of lower iron ore
reference prices and impairment charges of $1.0 billion
primarily related to the remedy asset sales in connection
with the Ilva acquisition and the agreed remedy package
required for the approval of the Votorantim acquisition,
partially offset by a $0.2 billion bargain purchase gain
relating to the acquisition of Ilva. Operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2018 was also impacted by $113
million in charges related to a blast furnace dismantling in
Florange (France), $60 million in charges related to the new
collective labor agreement in the United States (including a
signing bonus), a $146 million provision taken in the first
quarter of 2018 in respect of a litigation case that was paid
in the third quarter of 2018, offset in part by the recognition
in Brazil of $202 million in PIS/Cofins tax credits related to
prior periods.

ArcelorMittal's operating income for the year ended
December 31, 2017 was $5.4 billion as compared with an
operating income of $4.2 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2016 and was impacted by an impairment
charge of $206 million related to a downward revision of
cash flow projections in South Africa. Operating income in
2016 was positively affected by a one-time gain of $832
million on employee benefits following the signing of the
new U.S. labor contract and partially offset by an
impairment charge of $49 million related to the held for sale
classification of the ArcelorMittal Zaragoza facility in Spain
and an impairment charge of $156 million mainly related to
the Vanderbijlpark plant in South Africa.

ended December 31, 2018 decreased to $1.6 billion as
compared to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017, primarily due to the impairment charges of $908
million mainly related to the remedy asset sales for the
acquisition of Ilva (reflecting the adjustment to the carrying
amount of the disposal group to the expected sale proceeds
based on the offers received) as well as charges of $113
million related to blast furnace dismantling in Florange
(France) and a charge of $146 million taken for the German
Cartel case which settled in July 2018.Operating income for

2.1% to 44.7 million tonnes for the year ended December
31, 2018 as compared to 43.8 million tonnes for the year
ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to the
consolidation of Ilva as from November 1, 2018, partially
offset by production issues including floods in Asturias
(Spain) and blast furnace reline in ArcelorMittal Zenica

Management report 31

(Bosnia) in the second quarter and a power outage in
ArcelorMittal Méditerranée (Fos-sur-Mer, France) and a
slower ramp up following a blast furnace repair in Poland in
the third quarter of 2018.

operational issues described above, while steel shipments
in the second half of 2018 decreased 2.3% to 19.8 million
tonnes from 20.3 million tonnes in the second half of 2017
due to weak market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2018,
particularly in long products, and the operational issues
described above, partially offset by the consolidation of Ilva
as from November 1, 2018.

Steel shipments were 40.9 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2017, a 1.7% increase from steel shipments
for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the first half of
2017, steel shipments decreased 3.1% to 20.7 million
tonnes, from 21.3 million tonnes in the first half of 2016, due
to weaknesses in long market demand while steel
shipments in the second half of 2017 increased 7.1% as
compared to the second half of 2016. The decrease in
shipments in the first half of 2017 includes the effect of the
disposal of ArcelorMittal Zaragoza and the idling of
Zumarraga.

31, 2018, from 14.7 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2017, primarily due to planned (blast furnace
#9) and unplanned maintenance in Ukraine in the first half
of 2018 and an explosion at a gas pipeline at Temirtau
(Kazakhstan) in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Crude steel production for the ACIS segment decreased
marginally by 0.8% to 14.7 million tonnes for the year
ended December 31, 2017, from 14.8 million tonnes for the
year ended December 31, 2016.

Steel shipments for the year ended December 31, 2018
decreased by 10.3% to 11.7 million tonnes as compared to
13.1 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017
reflecting the operational issues mentioned above. In the
first half of 2018, steel shipments decreased 6.1% to 6.1
million tonnes from 6.5 million tonnes in the first half of 2017
due to lower CIS shipments partially offset by higher steel
shipments in South Africa, while steel shipments in the
second half of 2018 decreased 14.5% to 5.7 million as
compared to 6.6 million in the second half of 2017, primarily
due to lower steel shipments in CIS following the incidents
mentioned above.

Steel shipments for the year ended December 31, 2017
decreased by 1.3% to 13.1 million tonnes as compared to
13.3 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Steel shipments decreased 4.3% in the first half of 2017 to
6.5 million tonnes as compared to 6.8 million tonnes for the
first half of 2016. In the second half of 2017, steel shipments
increased 1.7% to 6.6 million as compared to 6.5 million in
the second half of 2016.

Average steel selling prices increased 16.1% for the year
ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017 in line with international prices. Average
steel selling prices increased 23.1% and 9.4% in the first
and second half of 2018, respectively, as compared to the
same periods in 2017.

Average steel selling prices increased 30.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2016 in line with international prices. Average
steel selling prices increased 36.9% and 24.7% in the first
and second half of 2017, respectively as compared to the
same periods in 2016.

1. There are three categories of sales: (1) “External sales”: mined product sold to third parties at market price; (2) “Market-priced tonnes’ internal sales of mined
product to ArcelorMittal facilities reported at prevailing market prices; (3) “Cost-plus tonnes”: internal sales of mined product to ArcelorMittal facilities on a cost-
plus basis. The determinant of whether internal sales are reported at market price or reported at cost-plus is whether or not the raw material could practically be
sold to third parties (i.e., there is a potential market for the product and logistics exist to access that market).

2. Market-priced tonnes represent amounts of iron ore and coal from ArcelorMittal mines that could practically be sold to third parties. Market-priced tonnes that are
transferred from the Mining segment to the Company's steel producing segments are reported at the prevailing market price. Shipments of raw materials that do

not constitute market-priced tonnes are transferred internally on a cost-plus basis.

primarily due to the increase in prices. Iron ore shipments
were 58.3 million tonnes for the year ended December 31,
2018, representing a marginal 0.7% increase as compared
to 57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Iron
ore shipments to external parties were 12.7 million tonnes
for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 11.8
million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017. Coal
shipments were 5.8 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2018 as compared with 6.3 million tonnes for
the year ended December 31, 2017.

Sales to external customers were $985 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017, representing a 26.1% increase
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016,
primarily due to the increase in prices. Iron ore shipments
were 57.9 million tonnes for the year ended December 31,
2017, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the restart
of Volcan in Mexico that delivered 1.7 million tonnes in
2017. Iron ore shipments to external parties were 11.8
million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017 as
compared to 12.3 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2016. Coal shipments were 6.3 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared
with 6.8 million tonnes for the year ended December 31,
2016. Shipments in 2016 were higher from Princeton in the
U.S. from liquidation of inventory.

The average reference iron ore price was $69.7per tonne in
2018, $71.39 per tonne in 2017 and $58.36 per tonne in
2016 (delivered to China, normalized to Qingdao and 62%
Fe US $ per tonne, Metal Bulletin) and the average
reference price for hard coking coal increased to $206.62
per tonne in 2018, $187.28 per tonne in 2017 and $142.44
per tonne in 2016 (Premium HCC FOB Aus, Metal Bulletin).
The increase in the average reference hard coking coal
price, accelerated in the second half of 2016 and continued
significant increases in 2017 and 2018. However, there may
not be a direct correlation between reference prices and
actual selling prices in various regions at a given time.

Operating income

Operating income for the Mining segment was $860 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to
$991 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
primarily driven by the decrease in the iron ore reference
prices and lower coal volumes.

Operating income for the Mining segment was $991 million
for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to
$366 million for the year ended December 31, 2016,
primarily driven by higher shipments and the increases in
the iron ore and coal reference prices.

Production

ArcelorMittal had own iron ore production of 58.5 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase
of 1.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017,
primarily due to Liberia (production of 4.6 million tonnes in
2018 which, although above the 2017 level, was slightly
below the 5 million tonne full year capacity, due to handling/
logistical issues at the new Gangra deposit during the wet
season in the second half of 2018), offset in part by lower
production in Canada (lower yield from a new mix of ore
bodies following a pit wall instability issue which first
occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017) and Mexico.

ArcelorMittal had own iron ore production of 57.4 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase
of 4.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016,
primarily attributed to an increase in production in Mexico
(following the restart of the Volcan mine in 2017) and
Canada. Liberia production was 2 million tonnes for the year
ended December 31, 2017.

ArcelorMittal had own coking coal production of 5.9 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease
of 6.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
mainly due to lower production in the Kazakhstan mines
following operational and geological issues..

ArcelorMittal had own coking coal production of 6.3 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase
of 0.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

Income or loss from investments in associates, joint
ventures and other investments

ArcelorMittal recorded income of $652 million from
investments in associates, joint ventures and other
investments for the year ended December 31, 2018, as
compared to $448 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 and includes a dividend income from Erdemir of $87
million as compared to $45 million in 2017.

ArcelorMittal recorded income of $448 million from
investments in associates, joint ventures and other
investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, as
compared to $615 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 and includes a $133 million gain from disposal of
ArcelorMittal USA's 21% stake in the Empire Iron Mining
Partnership and improved performance of Calvert and
Chinese investees, offset in part by a loss on dilution of the
Company's stake in China Oriental and the recycling of
cumulative foreign exchange translation losses to the
consolidated statement of operations following the disposal
of the Company's 50% stake in Kalagadi ($187 million).

Financing costs-net

Financing costs-net include net interest expense,
revaluation of financial instruments, net foreign exchange
income/expense (i.e., the net effects of transactions in a
foreign currency other than the functional currency of a
subsidiary) and other net financing costs (which mainly
include bank fees, accretion of defined benefit obligations
and other long-term liabilities).

Net financing costs were higher at $2.2 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $0.9 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2017. Net interest expense
(interest expense less interest income) was lower at $0.6
billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared
to $0.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, driven
by debt reduction including early bond repayments and
lower cost of debt.

Foreign exchange losses were $235 million as compared to
a gain of $546 million for the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The foreign exchange losses
were primarily due to the effect of the depreciation of the
U.S. dollar against the euro on the Company's euro
denominated debt in the first quarter of 2018. As of April 1,
2018, the Company designated a portfolio of euro
denominated debt (€5,169 million as of December 31, 2018)
as a hedge of certain euro denominated investments
(€7,804 million as of December 31, 2018) in order to
mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from certain euro
denominated subsidiaries’ net assets. The risk arises from
the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and euro, which causes the amount of the net
investments to vary. The hedged risk in the hedge of net
investments is a risk of a weakening euro against the U.S.
dollar that will result in a reduction in the carrying amount of
the Company's net investments in the subsidiaries subject
to the hedge. The euro denominated debt is designated as
a hedging instrument for the change in the value of the net
investments that is attributable to changes in the euro/U.S.
dollar spot rate. As a result, the Company's statement of
operations no longer includes foreign exchange exposure
on such euro denominated debt .

Other net financing costs (including expenses related to true
sale of receivables, bank fees, interest on pensions and fair
value adjustments of the call option of the mandatorily
convertible bond and derivative instruments) were $1.4
billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to
$0.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, and
included mark-to-market losses related to the mandatory
convertible bond call option totaling $0.5 billion as
compared to gains of $0.8 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017. Other net financing costs for the year
ended December 31, 2018 also included $0.1 billion
premium expense on the early redemption of bonds as
compared to $0.4 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017. Other net financing costs in 2017 were negatively

Management report 35

affected by mark-to-market losses relating to a derivative
embedded in a pellet supply agreement in the United States
(due to a payment based on the evolution of the price of
steel in the United States domestic steel market) of $0.3
billion.

Net financing costs were lower at $0.9 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2.1 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest expense
(interest expense less interest income) was lower at $0.8
billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared
to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, driven
by debt reduction including early bond repayments.

Foreign exchange gains were $546 million as compared to
a loss of $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively. The foreign exchange gains were
primarily due to the impact of the U.S. dollar depreciation on
euro denominated deferred tax assets, partially offset by
foreign exchange losses on euro denominated debt. The
U.S. dollar depreciated 13.8% against the euro in 2017.

Other net financing costs (including expenses related to true
sale of receivables, bank fees, interest on pensions and fair
value adjustments of the call option of the mandatorily
convertible bond and derivative instruments) was $0.6
billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to
$0.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, and
included $0.8 billion mark-to-market gains on derivatives
(primarily the call option of the mandatory convertible bond
following the market price increase in the underlying
shares), mark-to-market losses relating to a derivative
embedded in a pellet supply agreement in the United States
(due to a payment based on the evolution of the price of
steel in the United States domestic steel market) of $0.3
billion, $0.4 billion for premium expense on the early
redemption of bonds and an expense of $92 million relating
to the extension of the mandatory convertible bond. Other
net financing costs in 2016 were negatively affected by
premiums and fees of $0.4 billion relating to early redeemed
bonds in 2016 and $0.1 billion non-cash expense in
connection with the issuance of shares in the context of a B-
BBEE transaction in South Africa, partially offset by the fair
value adjustment for the mandatory convertible bonds for
$0.2 billion.

Income tax expense (benefit)

ArcelorMittal recorded an income tax benefit of $0.3 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to
income tax expense of $0.4 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017. The current income tax expense of
$928 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as
compared to $583 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 was primarily driven by improved results in a number
of countries. The deferred tax benefit of $1,277 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with a
deferred tax benefit of $151 million for the year ended


--- Page 31 ---

36 Management report

December 31, 2017 included a $1.4 billion deferred tax
benefit recorded mainly in Luxembourg, due to the
expectation of higher future profits. This benefit included a
$0.6 billion deferred tax income in the context of the change
in the currency denomination of the Company's tax losses in
Luxembourg as the revised taxable income projections in
U.S. dollar terms reflect a change in the foreign currency
exposure of the different income streams. Following the
May 16, 2018 approval of the extraordinary general meeting
("EGM") to change the share capital of the ArcelorMittal
parent company from euro to U.S. dollar, the parent
company will file consolidated tax returns in U.S. dollar for
the main Luxembourg tax integration going forward. The
euro denominated tax losses and the related deferred tax
asset held by the ArcelorMittal parent company in
Luxembourg were translated into U.S. dollar effective as of
January 1, 2018.

ArcelorMittal recorded an income tax expense of $0.4 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.0
billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The tax
expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a

derecognition of deferred tax assets for $0.7 billion in
Luxembourg largely due to the change in tax rate, while in
2017 a deferred tax asset of $0.3 billion was recorded in
Luxembourg following increased expectation of future
profits.

ArcelorMittal’s consolidated income tax expense (benefit) is
affected by the income tax laws and regulations in effect in
the various countries in which it operates and the pre-tax
results of its subsidiaries in each of these countries, which
can change from year to year. ArcelorMittal operates in
jurisdictions, mainly in Eastern Europe and Asia, which have
a structurally lower corporate income tax rate than the
statutory tax rate as enacted in Luxembourg (26.01%), as
well as in jurisdictions, mainly in Brazil and Mexico, which
have a structurally higher corporate income tax rate.

The statutory income tax expense (benefit) and the statutory
income tax rates of the countries that most significantly
resulted in the tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate for
each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016 are as set forth below:

Non-controlling interests

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was
$181 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as
compared to $7 million for the year ended December 31,
2017. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests

increased in 2018 primarily as a result of the improved
operating performance of ArcelorMittal South Africa.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $7
million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared
with net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of $45
million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income


--- Page 32 ---

attributable to non-controlling interests for 2017 was
primarily related to income generated by ArcelorMittal Mines
and Infrastructure Canada and Belgo Bekaert Arames in
Brazil partly offset by losses including impairment losses
generated by ArcelorMittal South Africa.

Net income attributable to equity holders of the parent

ArcelorMittal’s net income attributable to equity holders of
the parent was $5.1 billion $4.6 billion and $1.8 billion for
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

Liquidity and capital resources

ArcelorMittal’s principal sources of liquidity are cash
generated from its operations and its credit facilities at the
corporate level.

Because ArcelorMittal is a holding company, it is dependent
upon the earnings and cash flows of, as well as dividends
and distributions from, its operating subsidiaries to pay
expenses and meet its debt service obligations. Significant
cash or cash equivalent balances may be held from time to
time at the Company’s international operating subsidiaries,
in particular those in France and in the United States, where
the Company maintains cash management systems under
which most of its cash and cash equivalents are centralized,
and in Brazil, Canada, India, Kazakhstan, South Africa and
Ukraine. Some of these operating subsidiaries have debt
outstanding or are subject to acquisition agreements that
impose restrictions on such operating subsidiaries’ ability to
pay dividends, but such restrictions are not significant in the
context of ArcelorMittal’s overall liquidity. Repatriation of
funds from operating subsidiaries may also be affected by
tax and foreign exchange policies in place from time to time
in the various countries where the Company operates,
though none of these policies is currently significant in the
context of ArcelorMittal’s overall liquidity.

In management's opinion, ArcelorMittal’s credit facilities are
adequate for its present requirements.

As of December 31, 2018, ArcelorMittal’s cash and cash
equivalents, including restricted cash of $182 million,
amounted to $2.4 billion as compared to $2.8 billion as of
December 31, 2017. In addition, ArcelorMittal had available
borrowing capacity of $5.5 billion under its $5.5 billion
revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, ArcelorMittal’s total debt, which
includes long-term debt and short-term debt (including debt
classified as held for sale) was $12.6 billion, compared to
$12.9 billion as of December 31, 2017.

Net debt (defined as long-term debt ($9.3 billion) plus short-
term debt ($3.2 billion) including debt classified as held for
sale ($0.1 billion), less cash and cash equivalents and
restricted cash ($2.4 billion) was $10.2 billion as of

Management report 37

December 31, 2018, up from $10.1 billion at December 31,
2017, comprised of long-term debt ($10.1 billion) plus short-
term debt ($2.8 billion), less cash and cash equivalents and
restricted cash ($2.8 billion). Most of the external debt is
borrowed by the parent company on an unsecured basis
and bears interest at varying levels based on a combination
of fixed and variable interest rates. Gearing (defined as net
debt divided by total equity) at December 31, 2018 was 23%
as compared to 25% at December 31, 2017.

The margin applicable to ArcelorMittal’s principal credit
facilities ($5.5 billion revolving credit facility and certain
other credit facilities) and the coupons on certain of its
outstanding bonds are subject to adjustment in the event of
a change in its long-term credit ratings. On February 1,
2018, Standard & Poor's upgraded ArcelorMittal’s credit
rating to BBB- and placed ArcelorMittal on stable outlook.
On June 22, 2018, Moody's upgraded ArcelorMittal’s credit
rating to Baa3 and placed it on stable outlook. On July 13,
2018, Fitch upgraded ArcelorMittal’s credit rating to BBB-
and placed it on stable outlook. These upgrades resulted in
reduced interest expense.

ArcelorMittal’s $5.5 billion revolving credit facility signed on
December 19, 2018 and maturing on December 19, 2023
(with two one-year extension options (i.e. the options to
extend are in the first and second years, so at end 2019 and
at end 2020)), contains restrictive covenants. Among other
things, these covenants limit encumbrances on the assets
of ArcelorMittal and its subsidiaries, the ability of
ArcelorMittal’s subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of
ArcelorMittal and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets in
certain circumstances. The agreement also requires
compliance with a financial covenant, as summarized below.

The Company must ensure that the ratio of “Consolidated
Total Net Borrowings” (consolidated total borrowings less
consolidated cash and cash equivalents) to “Consolidated
EBITDA’ (the consolidated net pre-taxation profits of the
ArcelorMittal group for a Measurement Period, subject to
certain adjustments as set out in the facility) does not, at the
end of each “Measurement Period” (each period of 12
months ending on the last day of a financial half-year or a
financial year of the Company), exceed a certain ratio,
referred to by the Company as the “Leverage ratio”.
ArcelorMittal’s principal credit facilities set this ratio to 4.25
to 1. The Term Facilities Agreement entered into on
November 20, 2018 also includes this financial covenant
(see “—Financings—Other loans and facilities” below). As
of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance
with the ratio.

Non-compliance with the covenants in the Company's
borrowing agreements would entitle the lenders under such
facilities to accelerate the Company's repayment
obligations. The Company was in compliance with the
financial covenants in the agreements related to all of its

borrowings as of December 31, 2018 and December 31,
2017.

As of December 31, 2018, ArcelorMittal had guaranteed $99
million of debt of its operating subsidiaries. See also note
8.4 to the consolidated financial statements for all other
ArcelorMittal guarantees for associates and joint ventures.
ArcelorMittal’s debt facilities have provisions whereby the

acceleration of the debt of another borrower within the
ArcelorMittal group could, under certain circumstances, lead
to acceleration under such facilities.

The following table summarizes the repayment schedule of
ArcelorMittal’s outstanding indebtedness, which includes
short-term and long-term debt, as of December 31, 2018.

Financings

The principal financings of ArcelorMittal and its subsidiaries
are summarized below by category. Further information
regarding ArcelorMittal’s short-term and long-term
indebtedness is provided in note 6 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Principal credit facilities

On December 19, 2018, ArcelorMittal signed an agreement
for a $5.5 billion revolving credit facility (the "Facility"). This
Facility replaced the $5.5 billion revolving credit facility
dated April 30, 2015, which was amended and extended on
December 21, 2016. The agreement incorporates a single
tranche of $5.5 billion maturing on December 19, 2023 ,
with two one-year extension options (i.e. the options to
extend are in the first and second years end of 2019 and
end of 2020). The Facility may be used for general
corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, the $5.5
billion revolving credit facility was fully available. The
Company makes drawdowns from and repayments on this
Facility in the framework of its cash management.

On September 30, 2010, ArcelorMittal entered into the $500
million revolving multi-currency letter of credit facility (the
“Letter of Credit Facility”). The Letter of Credit Facility is
used by the Company and its subsidiaries for the issuance

of letters of credit and other instruments. The terms of the
letters of credit and other instruments contain certain
restrictions as to duration. The Letter of Credit Facility was
amended on October 26, 2012, to reduce its amount to
$450 million. On September 30, 2014, the Company
refinanced its Letter of Credit Facility by entering into a $350
million revolving multi-currency letter of credit facility, which
matures on May 31, 2019.

2018 and early 2019 capital markets, liability management
transactions and debt repayments

On March 29, 2018, at maturity, ArcelorMittal repaid the
€334 million ($411 million) principal amount that remained
outstanding, following the cash tender offers in April 2016 of
its €500 million 4.5% unsecured bonds.

On April 9, 2018, at maturity, ArcelorMittal repaid its €400
million ($491 million) 2018 Floating Rate Notes.

On August 7, 2018, pursuant to cash tender offers and
financed with existing cash and liquidity, ArcelorMittal
purchased:

* $432 million of its U.S. dollar denominated 7.00% Notes
due October 15, 2039 (the “2039 Notes”) for a total
aggregate purchase price (including premiums and
accrued interest) of $505 million. Following this purchase,
686 million principal amount of the 2039 Notes remained
outstanding.

+ $195 million of its U.S. dollar denominated 6.75% Notes
due March 1, 2041 (the “2041 Notes”) for a total
aggregate purchase price (including premiums and
accrued interest) of $224 million. Following this purchase,
434 million principal amount of the 2041 Notes remained
outstanding.

On January 17, 2019, ArcelorMittal issued €750 million
2.250% Notes due 2024. The Notes were issued under
ArcelorMittal’s €10 billion wholesale Euro Medium Term
Notes Program.

Mandatory convertible bond

On December 14, 2017, the Company extended the
conversion date for the $1 billion privately placed mandatory
convertible bond (the “MCB"”) issued by Hera Ermac, a
wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary. The MCB is
mandatorily convertible into preferred shares of such
subsidiary. The mandatory conversion date of the bond has
been extended to January 29, 2021. The Company has the
option to call the mandatory convertible bond until 10
business days before the maturity date. Hera Ermac
invested the proceeds of the bond issuance and an equity
contribution by the Company in notes issued by subsidiaries
of the Company linked to the values of shares of Erdemir
and China Oriental. The bond was privately placed with
Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and is not
listed. In connection with the extension of the conversion
date of the MCB, ArcelorMittal also extended the maturities
of the equity-linked notes in which the proceeds of the MCB
issuances are invested. The other main features of the MCB
remain unchanged. See note 10.2 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional details.

Commercial paper program

ArcelorMittal has a commercial paper program enabling
borrowings of up to €1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2018,
the outstanding amount was $1,295 million, compared to
$1,125 million as of December 31, 2017.

Other loans and facilities

On December 18, 2018, ArcelorMittal entered into an
agreement for financing with a financial institution for net
proceeds of CAD 292 million ($214 million) with repayment
over several dates in 2019 and 2020. As of December 31,
2018, CAD 295 million ($216 million) was outstanding.

On November 20, 2018, ArcelorMittal entered into a $7
billion term facility agreement with a group of lenders in
connection with the acquisition of ESIL. The agreement has
a term of one year (until November 20, 2019), subject to
ArcelorMittal’s option to extend the term by six months. The
facility may be used for certain payments by ArcelorMittal as
well as by the joint venture through which the Company
expects jointly to own and operate ESIL in partnership with
Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (the “Joint
Venture”). Any amounts borrowed by the Joint Venture
under the agreement are irrevocably and unconditionally
guaranteed by ArcelorMittal. The agreement includes the
same Leverage Ratio financial covenant as that included in
the Company's $5.5 billion revolving credit facility and is
also subject to certain mandatory prepayment events,
including the use of proceeds from debt capital market
issuances by the Group or capital raising by the Joint
Venture and certain disposals, in each case above $1
billion.See Key transactions and events in 2018.

Management report 39

On August 10, 2018, ArcelorMittal entered into a €300

into a $175 million loan agreement with the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development in order to support the
upgrade of its production facilities, energy efficiency
improvement and environmental impact reduction. The loan

used to repay or prepay existing indebtedness.

On May 25, 2017, ArcelorMittal South Africa signed a 4.5
billion South African rand revolving borrowing base finance
facility maturing on May 25, 2020. Any borrowings under the
facility are secured by certain eligible inventory and
receivables, as well as certain other working capital and
related assets of ArcelorMittal South Africa. The facility is
used for general corporate purposes. The facility is not
guaranteed by ArcelorMittal. As of December 31, 2018, 0.3
billion South African rand ($21 million) was drawn.

On December 16, 2016, ArcelorMittal signed a €350 million
finance contract with the European Investment Bank in
order to finance European research, development and
innovation projects over the period 2017-2020 within the
European Union, namely predominantly France, Belgium
and Spain, but also in Czech Republic, Poland, Luxembourg
and Romania. This operation benefits from a guarantee
from the European Union under the European Fund for
Strategic Investments. As of December 31, 2018, €350
million ($401 million) was fully drawn.

On May 23, 2016, ArcelorMittal USA LLC signed a $1 billion

--- Page 35 ---

40 Management report

by inventory and certain other working capital and related
assets of ArcelorMittal USA and certain of its subsidiaries in
the United States. The facility may be used for general
corporate purposes. The facility is not guaranteed by
ArcelorMittal. As of December 31, 2018, the facility was fully
available.

In 2014, ArcelorMittal entered into certain short-term
committed bilateral credit facilities. The facilities were
extended in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. As of December
31, 2018, the facilities, totaling approximately $0.9 billion,
remained fully available.

True sale of receivables (“TSR”) programs

The Company has established a number of programs for
sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable to
various financial institutions (referred to as true sale of
receivables (“TSR’)). As of December 31, 2018, the total
amount of trade accounts receivables sold amounted to
$4,980 million. Through the TSR programs, certain
operating subsidiaries of ArcelorMittal surrender the control,
risks and benefits associated with the accounts receivable
sold; therefore, the amount of receivables sold is recorded
as a sale of financial assets and the balances are removed
from the consolidated statements of financial position at the
moment of sale.

Earnings distribution

On November 6, 2015, ArcelorMittal’s Board of Directors
proposed the suspension of the dividend for the financial
year 2015. This proposal was approved by the shareholders
at the annual general meeting held on May 4, 2016. The
Company had indicated that a dividend will not be proposed
until its leverage had further improved.

ArcelorMittal held 8.3 million shares in treasury as of
December 31, 2018, as compared to 2.0 million shares as
of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the
number of shares held by the Company in treasury
represented approximately 0.82% of the Company's total
issued share capital.

On January 31, 2018, the Company announced that the
Board had agreed on a new dividend policy which was
approved by the shareholders at the annual general
meeting of shareholders in May 2018. Given the current de-
leveraging focus, dividends begin at $0.10/share in 2018
(paid from 2017 results). The Company intends to
progressively increase the base dividend paid to its
shareholders, and, on attainment of the net debt target,
return a percentage of net cash provided by operating
activities annually. Accordingly, the Board is proposing an
increase in the base dividend for 2019 (paid from 2018
earnings) to $0.20 per share to the shareholders at the
annual shareholders meeting in May 2019.

Pension/OPEB liabilities

The defined benefit liabilities for employee benefits
decreased $0.6 billion to $6.9 billion as of December 31,
2018, as compared to $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2017.
The decrease is mainly due to the decrease in the defined
benefit obligation due to higher discount rates during 2018.
For additional information with respect to the Company's
pension plan and OPEB liabilities, including a breakdown by
region and by type of plan, see note 7.2 to the consolidated
financial statements.

IFRS 16

As described in note 1.3.2. to the consolidated financial
statements, IFRS 16 “Leases” applies from January 1,
2019. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had
non-cancellable operating lease commitments on an
undiscounted basis of $1,869 million and $1,311 million,
respectively (see note 8.4 to the consolidated financial
statements). A review and assessment of the Company's
lease arrangements indicates that most of these
arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS
16 and the Company's gross debt and net debt will increase
accordingly. As at December 31, 2018, the Company
expects to recognize on January 1, 2019 additional lease
liabilities (discounted at the incremental borrowing rates at
that date) and right-of-use assets for an amount of $1.1
billion.

IFRS 9

In connection with the initial application of IFRS 9, as of
January 1, 2018, equity instruments with a carrying amount
of $1,471 million were reclassified from assets available-for-
sale to financial assets at fair value through other
comprehensive income. As a result, unrealized gains and
losses of investment in such equity instruments are no
longer recycled to the consolidated statement of operations
upon disposal but are now reclassified from other
comprehensive income to retained earnings within equity
upon disposal. The $608 million loss recorded in
comprehensive income in 2018 was mainly related to the
decrease in the share price of Erdemir.

Research and development, patents and licenses

Cost relating to research and development, patents and
licenses were not significant as percentage of sales.
Research and development costs expensed (and included
in selling, general and administration expenses) in 2018,
2017 and 2016, amounted to $290 million, $278 million and
$ 239 million, respectively.

Sources and uses of cash

Years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016

The following table presents a summary of cash flow of ArcelorMittal:

Management report 41

Summary of cash flow

For the year ended December 31,

(in $ millions) 2018 2017 2016
Net cash provided by operating activities 4,196 4,563 2,708
Net cash used in investing activities (3,759) (2,830) (1,143)
Net cash used in financing activities (689) (1,731) (2,926)

Net cash provided by operating activities

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided
by operating activities decreased to $4.2 billion , as
compared with $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017. The decrease in net cash provided by operating
activities was mainly due to an investment in operating
working capital of $4.38 billion which represented an outflow
for trade accounts receivable of $0.65 billion, an outflow for
inventories of $4.65 billion and an inflow for trade accounts
payable and other of $0.91 billion, partially offset by an
increase in operating income driven by the increase in
average steel selling prices offset by lower steel shipments.
The operating working capital investment for the year ended
December 31, 2018 largely reflected the price effect of
improved market conditions which impacted operating
working capital through higher inventories and higher trade
receivables. The investment in operating working capital for
the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected a lower than
anticipated release of working capital in the fourth quarter of
2018 due to the weaker apparent demand conditions
leading to an accumulation of metal stock and raw material
volumes.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided
by operating activities increased to $4.6 billion, as
compared with $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating
activities is mainly due to an increase in operating income
driven by the increase in average steel selling prices
partially offset by increases in the raw material costs and an
investment in operating working capital of $1.88 billion
which represented an outflow for trade accounts receivable
of $0.62 billion, an outflow for inventories of $2.35 billion
and an inflow for trade accounts payable and other of $1.09
billion.

Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.8 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2017. Capital
expenditures increased to $3.3 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.8 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2017. Capital expenditures for the
year ended December 31, 2018 was lower than expected
due to underspending in certain strategic projects (see
"Information on the Company—Property, plant and
equipment—Capital expenditure projects”) and at Ilva due to
the acquisition only being completed in November 2018.
Cash used in investing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2018 included the acquisition of the Uttam
Galva and KSS Petron debt for $1,001 million in the context
of the ESIL bidding process, offset in part by the proceeds
from the sale of Go Steel Frydek Mistek ($39 million), the
second installment of proceeds of $44 million from the
disposal of ArcelorMittal USA's 21% stake in the Empire Iron
Mining Partnership, $220 million of sale proceeds following
the disposal of the Company's 50% interest in Macsteel and
$55 million relating to the release of restricted cash related
to the mandatory convertible bond following contractual
renegotiation.

Net cash used in investing activities was $2.8 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.1 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash from investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 included
tangible asset disposals and proceeds from the disposal of
U.S. long products Georgetown, the first installment of
proceeds of $44 million from the disposal of ArcelorMittal
USA's 21% stake in the Empire Iron Mining Partnership
offset by $44 million cash consideration (net of cash

acquired for $14 million and $5 million to be paid upon
conclusion of certain business restructuring measures) for
the acquisition of a 55.5% stake in Bekaert Sumaré and
$110 million deposited in a restricted cash account in
ArcelorMittal South Africa in connection with various
environmental obligations and true sales of receivables
programs.

ArcelorMittal’s major capital expenditures in the year ended
December 31, 2018 included the following projects: the
Mexico hot strip mill, the new LF&CC 2&3 in ArcelorMittal
Kryvyi Rih, the modernization of ArcelorMittal Dofasco's hot
strip mill, the footprint optimization project at Indiana Harbor
and the new walking beam furnaces at Burns Harbor, along
with other ongoing projects.

In 2019, capital expenditure is expected to be approximately
$4.3 billion reflecting carry over from underspend in 2018

continued high return investments in Mexico and Brazil and
other strategic projects (largely cost optimization). See
“Capital Expenditure projects" for more detail.

increased to $42.1 billion at December 31, 2018, as
compared to $38.8 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily
due to net income attributable to the equity holders of the
parent of $5.1 billion and $0.6 billion actuarial gains partly
offset by $2.2 billion foreign exchange losses. See note 10
to ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2018.

Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent
increased to $38.8 billion at December 31, 2017, as

Trend information

All of the statements in this “Trend Information” section are
subject to and qualified by the information set forth under
the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements”. See also "Key factors affecting results of
operations”.

Outlook

Based on the current economic outlook, ArcelorMittal
expects a slight expansion in global ASC in 2019 by +0.5%
to +1% (versus growth of +2.8% in 2018). By region: ASC in
the United States is expected to grow +0.5% to +1.5% in
2019, with automotive demand to remain broadly stable,
growth is driven by continued albeit weaker demand in
machinery and construction (a moderation of growth versus
+1.7% in 2018). In Europe, continued strength in
construction is balanced by stable automotive demand and
slower growth in machinery and is expected to support ASC
growth of approximately +0.5% to +1.0% in 2019 (a
moderation of growth versus +2.9% in 2018). In Brazil, ASC
growth in 2019 is forecasted in the range of +3.5% to +4.5%
(a moderation of growth versus +7.3% in 2018) as growth in
automotive and machinery slows but construction activity
grows for the first time since 2013. In the CIS, ASC is
expected to grow +1.0% to +2.0% in 2019 (versus +1.8% in
2018). Overall, World ex-China ASC is expected to grow by
approximately +2.0% to +3.0% in 2019, slight stronger than
in 2018 due to stabilization in Turkey after a significant
decline in 2018 (versus +2.1% in 2018). In China, overall
demand is expected to decline by between -0.5% to -1.5%
in 2019 (versus growth of +3.5% in 2018) as relatively
stable demand from automotive and construction is offset by


--- Page 38 ---

declining machinery output. Given these demand
expectations, as well as the expectation that operational
disruptions (both controllable and uncontrollable) that
negatively impacted 2018 shipments will not recur, the
Company's steel shipments are expected to increase in
2019 versus 2018.

Market-priced iron ore shipments for 2019 are expected to
be broadly stable as compared to 2018 with increases in
Liberia and AMMC to be offset by lower volume in Mexico
(in part due to the end of life of the Volcan mine).

The Company expects capital expenditures to increase by
$1.0 billion to $4.3 billion in 2019 from $3.3 billion in 2018,
including $0.4 billion carryover from underspend from 2018,
the impact of Ilva ($0.4 billion) and the continued investment
in higher return projects in Mexico and Brazil. Interest is
expected to be stable at $0.6 billion, and cash taxes are
expected to increase primarily on account of certain cash
tax settlements deferred from 2018.

Due to a smaller than anticipated release in the fourth
quarter of 2018, the Company invested more in working
capital than expected in 2018 ($4.4 billion versus guidance
of $3.0-3.5 billion). The Company expects this additional
investment to be released over the course of 2019. The
extent of this release will be dictated by market conditions,
particularly the price and volume environment in the final
weeks.

Disclosures about market risk

ArcelorMittal is exposed to a number of different market
risks arising from its normal business activities. Market risk
is the possibility that changes in raw materials prices,
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, base metal
prices (zinc, nickel, aluminum and tin) and energy prices
(oil, natural gas and power) will adversely affect the value of
ArcelorMittal’s financial assets, liabilities or expected future
cash flows.

The fair value information presented below is based on the
information available to management as of the date of the
consolidated statements of financial position. Although
ArcelorMittal is not aware of any factors that would
significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such

entered into pursuant to the Company’s risk management
policies.

Risk management

ArcelorMittal has implemented strict policies and procedures
to manage and monitor financial market risks.
Organizationally, supervisory functions are separated from
operational functions, with proper segregation of duties.
Financial market activities are overseen by the President
and CFO, the Corporate Finance and Tax Committee and
the CEO Office.

All financial market risks are managed in accordance with
the Treasury and Financial Risk Management Policy. These
risks are managed centrally through Group Treasury by a
group specializing in foreign exchange, interest rate,
commodity, internal and external funding and cash and
liquidity management.

All financial market hedges are governed by ArcelorMittal’s
Treasury and Financial Risk Management Policy, which
includes a delegated authority and approval framework, sets
the boundaries for all hedge activities and dictates the
required approvals for all Treasury activities. Hedging
activity and limits are monitored on an ongoing basis.
ArcelorMittal enters into transactions with numerous
counterparties, mainly banks and financial institutions, as
well as brokers, major energy producers and consumers.

As part of its financial risk management activities,
ArcelorMittal uses derivative instruments to manage its
exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange
rates and commodities prices. These instruments are
principally interest rate, currency and commodity swaps,
spots and forwards. ArcelorMittal may also use futures and
options contracts.

Counterparty risk

ArcelorMittal has established detailed counterparty limits to
mitigate the risk of default by its counterparties. The limits
restrict the exposure ArcelorMittal may have to any single
counterparty. Counterparty limits are calculated taking into
account a range of factors that govern the approval of all
counterparties. The factors include an assessment of the
counterparty’s financial soundness and its ratings by the
major rating agencies, which must be of a high quality.
Counterparty limits are monitored on a periodic basis.

All counterparties and their respective limits require the prior
approval of the Corporate Finance and Tax Committee.
Standard agreements, such as those published by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
(ISDA) are negotiated with all ArcelorMittal trading
counterparties.

Currency exposure

ArcelorMittal seeks to manage each of its entities’ exposure
to its operating currency. For currency exposure generated
by activities, the conversion and hedging of revenues and
costs in foreign currencies is typically performed using
currency transactions on the spot market and forward
market. For some of its business segments, ArcelorMittal
hedges future cash flows.

Because a substantial portion of ArcelorMittal’s assets,
liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar (its reporting currency),
ArcelorMittal has exposure to fluctuations in the values of
these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. These currency
fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the value of the
U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the Canadian dollar,
Brazilian real, South African rand, Argentine peso, Kazakh
tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia, as well as fluctuations in the
currencies of the other countries in which ArcelorMittal has
significant operations and/or sales, could have a material
impact on its results of operations.

ArcelorMittal faces transaction risk, where its businesses
generate sales in one currency but incur costs relating to
that revenue in a different currency. For example,

ArcelorMittal’s non-U.S. subsidiaries may purchase raw
materials, including iron ore and coking coal, in U.S. dollars,
but may sell finished steel products in other currencies.
Consequently, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar will
increase the cost of raw materials, thereby negatively
impacting the Company’s operating margins, unless the
Company is able to pass along the higher cost in the form of
higher selling prices.

ArcelorMittal faces foreign currency translation risk, which
arises when ArcelorMittal translates the financial statements
of its subsidiaries, denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar for inclusion in ArcelorMittal’s consolidated
financial statements.

The tables below illustrate the impact of an appreciation and
a depreciation of the U.S. dollar of 10% against the euro, on
the conversion of the net debt of ArcelorMittal into U.S.
dollars as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The impact on net debt denominated in a currency different
than the euro, is computed based on historical data of how
such currency would move against the U.S. dollar when the
U.S. dollar appreciates/depreciates 10% against the euro. A
positive sign means an increase in the net debt.

Derivative instruments

statements of operations or in equity according to nature
and effectiveness of the hedge.

ArcelorMittal uses derivative instruments to manage its

exposure to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange
rates and commodity prices. Changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated

Derivatives used are non-exchange-traded derivatives such
as over-the-counter swaps, options and forward contracts.


--- Page 40 ---

For the Company's tabular presentation of information
related to its market risk sensitive instruments, please see
note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Interest rate sensitivity

Cash balances, which are primarily composed of euros and
U.S. dollars, are managed according to the short term (up to
one year) guidelines established by senior management on
the basis of a daily interest rate benchmark, primarily
through short-term currency swaps, without modifying the
currency exposure.

Interest rate risk on debt

ArcelorMittal’s policy consists of incurring debt at fixed and
floating interest rates, primarily in U.S. dollars and euros
according to general corporate needs. Interest rate and
currency swaps are utilized to manage the currency and/or
interest rate exposure of the debt.

For the Company's tabular presentation of the fair values of
its short and long term debt, please see note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Commodity price risk

ArcelorMittal utilizes a number of exchange-traded
commodities in the steel-making process. In certain
instances, ArcelorMittal is the leading consumer worldwide
of certain commodities. In some businesses and in certain
situations, ArcelorMittal is able to pass this exposure on to
its customers. The residual exposures are managed as
appropriate.

Financial instruments related to commodities (base metals,
energy, freight and emission rights) are utilized to manage
ArcelorMittal’s exposure to price fluctuations.

Hedges in the form of swaps and options are utilized to
manage the exposure to commodity price fluctuations.

For the Company's tabular presentation of information
related to its market risk sensitive instruments, please see
note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

In respect of non-exchange traded commodities,
ArcelorMittal is exposed to volatility in the prices of raw
materials such as iron ore (which is generally correlated
with steel prices with a time lag) and coking coal. This
exposure is almost entirely managed through long-term
contracts, however some hedging of iron ore exposures is
made through derivative contracts. For a more detailed
discussion of ArcelorMittal’s iron ore and coking coal
purchases, see "Raw materials”.

Key transactions and events in 2018

ArcelorMittal’s principal investments, acquisitions and
disposals, and other key events that occurred during the
year ended December 31, 2018 are summarized below.

Acquisition of liva

On November 1, 2018, ArcelorMittal announced that AM
InvestCo Italy S.r.I ("AM Investco") completed the
acquisition of Ilva, after having been granted merger
clearance by the European Commission ("EC") on May 7,
2018 on the basis of the Company's committed divestment
package (see below) and fulfilling all of the conditions
precedent in ArcelorMittal’s contract with the Italian
government for the lease and subsequent purchase of Ilva,
including the labor agreement with Ilva’s trade unions, which
was reached on September 6, 2018. Ilva is Europe’s largest
single steel site and only integrated steelmaker in Italy with
its main production facility based in Taranto. Ilva also has
significant steel finishing capacity in Taranto, Novi Ligure
and Genova. As a result of the lease agreement, the assets
and liabilities subject to the transaction are leased by
subsidiaries of AM InvestCo, including ArcelorMittal Italia
S.p.A. The purchase price amounts to €1.8 billion ($2.1
billion) subject to certain adjustments, with annual leasing
costs of €180 million ($206 million) to be paid in quarterly
installments, with rental payments qualifying as down
payments against the purchase price. The lease is fora
minimum period of four years. The agreement includes
industrial capital expenditure commitments of approximately
€1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) over a seven-year period focused
on blast furnaces including €0.2 billion revamping of blast
furnace #5 intending to bring steel production to 8 million
tonnes by 2024, steel shops and finishing lines and
environmental capital expenditure commitments of
approximately €0.8 billion ($0.9 billion) including €0.3 billion
for stock pile coverage, €0.2 billion for reduction of
emissions at coke ovens and €0.2 billion in waste water
treatment. The agreement also includes environmental
remediation obligations of approximately €0.5 billion ($0.6
billion), the latter of which will be funded with funds seized
by the Italian Government from the former shareholder. As
part of the labor agreement with llva’s trade unions, of Ilva’s
13,800 employees, 10,700 were hired by ArcelorMittal. In
addition, between 2023 and 2025, the Company has
committed to hire any workers who remain under Ilva’s
extraordinary administration. The Company has identified
synergies of €310 million, which are targeted to be realized
by 2020.

Management report 49

ArcelorMittal is the principal partner in AM InvestCo with a
94.45% equity stake in the consortium, with Banca Intesa
Sanpaolo ("ISP") holding 5.55%. ISP's interest is subject to
put and call option arrangements exercisable by
ArcelorMittal and ISP between November 1, 2020 and
November 1, 2025 and between November 1, 2021 and
November 1, 2025, respectively. Following completion of the
transaction, ArcelorMittal has assumed full management
control of Ilva, which forms a new business cluster within
ArcelorMittal Europe - Flat Products and has been renamed
ArcelorMittal Italia. See Note 2.2.4 to ArcelorMittal’s
consolidated financial statements for further details.

Ilva related Divestments

On October 12, 2018 and November 2, 2018 ArcelorMittal
received two binding offers from Liberty House Group
(“Liberty House”) for the acquisition of ArcelorMittal Ostrava
(Czech Republic), ArcelorMittal Galati (Romania),
ArcelorMittal Skopje (North Macedonia), ArcelorMittal
Piombino (Italy), the Company's only galvanized steel plant
in Italy, ArcelorMittal Dudelange (Luxembourg) and the
following finishing lines at ArcelorMittal Liege (Belgium): hot
dipped galvanizing lines 4 and 5 in Flémalle, hot-rolled
pickling, cold rolling and tin packaging lines in Tilleur. All
assets are part of a divestment package the Company
agreed to with the EC during its merger control investigation
into the Company's acquisition of Ilva. On January 23, 2019,
the Company submitted to the EC a revised offer from
Liberty House in respect of the same package of assets.
Transaction closing is conditional on EC approval and the
conclusion of consultations with local and European Works
Councils.

ESIL

On March 2, 2018, ArcelorMittal announced the signature of
a joint venture formation agreement with NSSMC in relation
to its offer to acquire ESIL, which was subsequently
amended and restated on January 22, 2019. On April 2,
2018, ArcelorMittal submitted an offer (the "Offer") in the re-
bidding process for ESIL. On October 17, 2018, following a
judgment from the Supreme Court of India on October 4,
2018, ArcelorMittal announced that it had approved a
payment of 7,469 crore rupees (approximately $1 billion,
subsequently paid) to the financial creditors of Uttam Galva
and KSS Petron in order that the Offer would be eligible for
consideration by ESIL's Committee of Creditors ("CoC").
ArcelorMittal had previously been a shareholder of Uttam
Galva and HSBC Trustee (C. |.) Limited, as trustee of trusts
of which Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, Mrs. Usha Mittal and their
children are the beneficiaries, had previously been a
shareholder of KSS Petron. At the time of such payment,
neither had any interest in such companies and, in
particular, the trusts and their beneficiaries did not have any
liability to KSS Petron or its creditors or other stakeholders
and hence did not benefit from such payment. On October
19, 2018, ArcelorMittal was evaluated the H1 Resolution


--- Page 45 ---

50 Management report

Applicant (the preferred bidder) by the CoC of ESIL and on
October 26, 2018, ArcelorMittal announced that the CoC
voted to approve the Company’s acquisition plan for ESIL
(the "Resolution Plan"). ESIL’s Resolution Professional, on
behalf of the CoC, issued the Company with a Letter of
Intent ("LOI") stating that the Company was identified as the
“Successful Resolution Applicant".

The Resolution Plan includes an upfront payment of 42,000
crore rupees (approximately $5.7 billion) towards ESIL’s
debt resolution, with a further 8,000 crore rupees
(approximately $1.1 billion) of capital injection into ESIL to
support operational improvement, increase production
levels and deliver enhanced levels of profitability. The
Company provided a $0.6 billion performance guarantee in
connection with the execution of the Resolution Plan.

In line with ESIL’s corporate insolvency process,
ArcelorMittal’s Resolution Plan must now be formally
accepted by India’s National Company Law Tribunal
(“NCLT”) before completion. The NCLT has completed
hearing the CoC's application for the approval of the
Resolution Plan, as well as objections and challenges from
different parties, including creditors of ESIL and the current
shareholder. While it is difficult to predict the timing of an
NCLT approval, a decision is expected in the first quarter of
2019 and the amounts of debt payment and capital injection
specified in the Resolution Plan would become payable
promptly after such approval is obtained.

ESIL is an integrated flat steel producer, and the largest
steel company in western India. ESIL’s main steel
manufacturing facility is located at Hazira, Gujarat in
Western India. It also has:

-  Twoiron ore beneficiation plants close to the mines
in Kirandul and Dabuna, with slurry pipelines that
then transport the beneficiated iron ore slurry to the
pellet plants in the Kirandul-Vizag and Dabuna-
Paradeep systems;

-— adownstream facility in Pune (including a pickling
line, a cold rolling mill, a galvanizing mill, a color
coating mill and a batch annealing plant); and

— seven service centers in the industrial clusters of
Hazira, Bhuj, Indore, Bahadurgarh, Chennai,
Kolkata and Pune. It has a complete range of flat
rolled steel products, including value added
products, and significant iron ore pellet capacity
with two main pellet plant systems in Kirandul-
Vizag and Dabuna-Paradeep, which have the
potential for expansion. Its facilities are located
close to ports with deep draft for movement of raw
materials and finished goods.

In terms of iron ore pellet capacity, the Kirandul-Vizag
system has 8 million tonnes of annual pellet capacity and
the Dabuna-Paradeep system has 6 million tonnes of

annual pellet capacity, which is in the process of being
expanded to a new capacity level of 12 million tonnes. This
expansion would bring pellet capacity above Essar’s own
requirements and provide the opportunity to improve
operating income by fully utilizing such pellet capacity.

The Resolution Plan includes a capital expenditure plan of
18,697 crore (approximately $2.8 billion) to be implemented
in two stages over six years. The first stage would involve
investments to increase the production of finished steel
goods sustainably to 6.5 million tonnes per annum and
includes completion of ongoing capital expenditure projects
with respect to a coke oven, second sinter plant, third line
CSP caster, Paradeep pellet plant and Dabuna beneficiation
plant. The first stage will also include investment in
maintenance to restore current assets, the implementation
of an environmental management plan and the
implementation of ArcelorMittal’s best practices on raw
material sourcing, plant operations, sales and product mix
(in particular through greater sophistication of the quality
and markets of the steel produced with a focus on
developing sales to the automotive industry), people
management and health & safety. The second stage would
involve investments to increase the production of finished
steel goods from 6.5 million tonnes per annum to 8.5 million
tonnes per annum by the end of 2024, including asset
reconfiguration and the addition of a coke oven, blast
furnace and basic oven furnace.

There is also a long-term aspiration to increase finished
steel shipments to between 12 and 15 million tonnes tonnes
through the addition of new iron and steelmaking assets, so
that ESIL can play an active role and fully benefit from the
anticipated growth in the Indian steel industry.

After completion, ArcelorMittal expects jointly to own and
operate ESIL in partnership with NSSMC, Japan’s largest
steel producer and the third largest steel producer in the
world, in-line with a joint venture formation agreement
signed with NSSMC (the “Joint Venture”). ArcelorMittal and
NSSMC currently expect to finance the Joint Venture
through a combination of partnership equity (one-third) and
debt (two-thirds), and ArcelorMittal anticipates that its
investment in the Joint Venture will be equity accounted.

On November 20, 2018, ArcelorMittal entered into a $7
billion term facilities agreement (the “Term Facilities
Agreement’) with a group of lenders in connection with the
acquisition of ESIL. The agreement has a term of one year
(i.e., until November 20, 2019), subject to ArcelorMittal’s
option to extend the term by six months. The facility may be
used for certain payments by ArcelorMittal as well as by the
Joint Venture. Any amounts borrowed by the Joint Venture
under the agreement are irrevocably and unconditionally
guaranteed by ArcelorMittal. The Term Facilities Agreement
includes the following financial covenant: ArcelorMittal must
ensure that the “Leverage Ratio”, being the ratio of
“Consolidated Total Net Borrowings” (consolidated total


--- Page 46 ---

borrowings less consolidated cash and cash equivalents) to
“Consolidated EBITDA” (the consolidated net pre-taxation
profits of the ArcelorMittal group for a Measurement Period,
subject to certain adjustments as defined in the facilities), at
the end of each “Measurement Period” (each period of 12
months ending on the last day of a financial half-year or a
financial year of ArcelorMittal), is not greater than a ratio of
4.25 to one. The Term Facilities Agreement is also subject to
certain mandatory prepayment events, including as a result
of the use of proceeds from debt capital market issuances
by the Group or capital raising by the Joint Venture and
certain other disposals, in each case above $1 billion.

ESIL’s assets do not include certain assets that are ancillary
to the steel plant, such as a slurry pipeline, power plants
and port facilities. AM and NSSMC are visiting some of
these facilities in light of the planned acquisition of ESIL to
understand the supply arrangements for raw materials and
power for the steel mill.

Acquisition of Votorantim Siderurgia.

In February 2018, the Brazilian antitrust authority ("CADE")
approved the acquisition by ArcelorMittal of Votorantim
Siderurgia, subject to certain divestments. The closing of
the transaction occurred on April 1, 2018, and Votorantim
Siderurgia, under the new corporate name of ArcelorMittal
Sul Fluminense (“AMSF”), became a subsidiary of
ArcelorMittal Brasil.

The combination of the businesses resulted in a long
product steel producer with annual crude steel capacity of
5.1 million metric tonnes. This acquisition aims to create
value through cost, logistical and operational synergies
totaling approximately $110 million per annum. See Note
2.2.4 to ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements for
further details. In particular, the combination results in
geographically complementary production facilities (i.e.,
ArcelorMittal’s Monelevade, Juiz de Fora and Piracicaba
facilities and Votorantim’s Barra Mansa and Resende plants
and its 50% interest in the joint venture Sitrel in Trés
Lagoas).

CADE’s approval was subject to the fulfillment of certain
divestment commitments which were completed in early
May. The divestments included ArcelorMittal Brasil’s two
production sites of Cariacica and Itauina, as well as some
wire drawing equipment. See Note 2.3.1 to ArcelorMittal’s
consolidated financial statements for further details.

Other Events in 2018

. During 2018, ArcelorMittal completed several debt
financing and repayment transactions. See

addition to his current responsibilities. This nomination
reflects the increasing global strategic role Aditya Mittal has
across the group, supporting the Chairman and CEO, Mr.
Lakshmi Mittal. As President and CFO, he will continue to
report to the Chairman and CEO. Together, Mr. Mittal and
Aditya Mittal comprise the CEO office.
