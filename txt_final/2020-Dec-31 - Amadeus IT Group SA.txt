Market background and segment performance

During the fourth quarter of 2020, global air traffic declined by 70.2%’ relative to prior year, representing an
improvement over the 76.0%’ traffic contraction we saw in the third quarter of the year. However, the progress we
had seen each month since May stabilized in November, with traffic down in the month by 70.3%’ year-on-year,
broadly unchanged from October (-70.6%’). November saw the resurgence of the virus in some regions ani
associated restrictions weighed in on air travel in certain domestic and international markets. Europe was the most
impacted due to strict containment measures. In turn, we also saw continued improvements in November in other
parts of the world, such as in the regions of Latin America or North America. In the second half of December, the
momentum of the pandemic eased in certain regions and traffic improved, such as in Europe, resulting in globa
traffic in the final month of the year declining by 69.7%’ vs. 2019. The 2020 year concluded with global air traffic
contracting by 65.9%’ in the full year period, relative to 2019.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Amadeus air travel agency bookings growth vs. 2019 continued to show gradua
improvements each month, supported by both the gross bookings evolution and a continued normalization of the
cancellation ratio. As a result, air travel agency bookings decreased by 79.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative
to 2019 and Distribution revenue declined by 77.9% vs. prior year. Excluding the effect from cancellations associate:
with COVID-19, our underlying Distribution revenue evolution in the fourth quarter was -71.2%. In the year 2020,
our air travel agency volumes and Distribution revenues decreased by 81.5% and 77.1%, respectively (a -62.6%
underlying revenue evolution excluding the COVID-19 cancellations effect).

Amadeus Passengers Boarded performed in line with industry traffic throughout the fourth quarter. Amadeus
Passengers Boarded performance continued to improve month on month until the end of the year, across regions,
with the exception of Europe. In Europe, we saw a deterioration in the month of November compared to October,

2 Adjusted to exclude costs related to the implementation of the cost savings program announced in the second quarter of 2020. These costs relate
mostly to severance payments and amounted to €93.4 million and €169.1 million in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively (€66.4
million and €120.9 million in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively, post tax). See sections 3 and 5 for more details.

driven by the elevated COVID cases and reintroduction of travel restrictions. During the fourth quarter, Amadeus
Passengers Boarded declined by 72.4% vs. 2019, following a decline of 74.9% in the third quarter vs. prior year,
resulting in an evolution of -65.4% for the 2020 full year period. IT Solutions revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020
contracted by 48.5%, outperforming our passengers boarded negative growth, supported by revenues across our
business portfolio not directly linked to airline traffic or not driven by transactions, particularly in the area of
Hospitality. In the 2020 full year, IT Solutions revenue experienced a 40.2% revenue decline relative to 2019.

Fourth quarter 2020 Group financial performance

As a result of the above industry backdrop and volume evolutions, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Amadeus Group
revenue declined by 64.6%, or by 61.0% excluding the COVID-19 related cancellations effect. Our cost of revenue

in the period. The fixed cost reduction plans we announced in the second quarter of 2020 continued to generate
savings, and in the fourth quarter of 2020 our P&L fixed costs (composed of Personnel and Other Operating
Expenses) declined by 24.7% relative to the same quarter in 2019.

prior year and supported a Free Cash Flow result for the fourth quarter amounting to a €213.5 million cash outflow.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had an Adjusted Profit? loss of €88.2 million. Excluding the COVID-19 associated
cancellations and bad debt effects, as well as upfront financing fees in relation to the bridge to bond facility signed
in March 2020, and the convertible bond issued in April 2020, our Adjusted Profit underlying performance was -
119.7%.

2020 Full Year Group financial performance

cancellations effect. EBITDA’? had a negative evolution of -89.8%, impacted by COVID-19 associated cancellation and
bad debt effects, excluding which our underlying EBITDA performance was -74.9%"°, supported by the progress in
our fixed cost reduction plan. We experienced an Adjusted Profit’ loss of €302.4 million, which had an evolution
excluding cancellations and bad debt effects, as well as upfront financing fees in relation to the bridge to bond facility
signed in March 2020, and the convertible bond issued in April 2020, of -103.9%. Free cash flow in the 2020 full year
period amounted to a cash outflow of €541.9 million, with net financial debt’? closing the year at €3,073.9 million.

Our commercial activity progressed through the last quarter of the year and included the signing of 11 new contracts
or renewals of distribution agreements with airlines, amounting to a total of 67 in the 2020 full year. In December,
we were pleased to announce another NDC agreement with Singapore Airlines, which will start offering its NDC
content through the Amadeus Travel Platform from January 2021, including ancillary services and additional content
like special fares, and personalized merchandising offers. Additionally, on the travel agency front, in 2020, we signed

we reinforced our strategic partnership with Expedia Group, with the renewal of our long-term global distribution
agreement, also including Amadeus’ latest technology and IT solutions.

In Airline IT, we continued to expand our PSS customer base with Air Senegal, Air Burkina and Uganda Airlines
contracting for the Altéa PSS among other solutions. Additionally, we progressed with our upselling efforts and Gulf
Air and Kenya Airways contracted for additional Amadeus airline IT solutions in the fourth quarter. Finally, in
Hospitality and in Airport IT we continued to renew contracts and to grow our respective customer bases (see section
2 Business Highlights).

Liquidity enhancement and plan to strengthen Amadeus for the future

At December 31, liquidity available to Amadeus amounted to c.€3.5 billion, represented by cash (€1,555.1 million),
short term investments (€900.5 million) and an undrawn revolving credit facility (€1,000 million). Our main financial
maturities over 2021 and 2022 include (i) a €500 million bond maturity in November 2021, (ii) a €500 million bond
maturity in March 2022, (iii) several maturities in aggregate amounting to €62.5 million of our older EIB loan, and (iv)
Commercial Paper of €622.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Amadeus has been able to refinance its
commercial paper maturities during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. However, with the aim to extend
the duration of our debt, Amadeus issued a €500 million Floating Rate Note on February 2, 2021. These floating rate
notes have a two year term, with an optional redemption for the issuer within the term of 374 days after the issuance
date, at a variable 3-month Euribor interest rate plus 65 basic points. This new financing instrument will gradually
replace our Commercial Paper maturities.

Furthermore, in March 2020 Amadeus announced an initial set of measures to reduce costs, followed by a plan of
actions in July 2020 to strengthen our capabilities for the future, to improve the way we operate, the way we serve
our customers and to enhance innovation. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we have achieved a fixed cost
reduction (excluding bad debt) relative to 2019, together in the Personnel and Other operating expenses lines in the
Income Statement and in the Capital Expenditure caption in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows combined,
of €195.8 million, totaling €506.1 million for the 2020 full year period. In 2021, we aim to maintain this fixed cost
reduction and to achieve approximately an additional €50 million reduction vs. 2020.

The implementation of the operational programs together with the workforce reduction will generate associated
implementation costs of broadly €200 million. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we incurred implementation costs
associated with these fixed cost reduction programs amounting to €93.4 million, thus totaling to an amount of
€169.1 million for the 2020 full year period. The balance to the expected total implementation costs amount of
approximately €200 million will be incurred in 2021.

2. Business highlights

Distribution

Continue broadening and enhancing our content offering for our customers remains one of our priorities During
2020, we signed 67 new contracts or renewals of distribution agreements with airlines, including Air New
Zealand, Fiji Airways , Frontier Airlines and Icelandair.

Since October, and following our agreement with Southwest Airlines, the airline’s complete offer for business
travel is available through the Amadeus Travel Platform.

We made steady progress on our NDC strategy despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In
September, we announced a strategic and innovative NDC distribution agreement with Air France-KLM Group
thanks to which the group’s NDC offers will be made available for travel agents through the Amadeus Travel
Platform. Finally, in December, we announced that Singapore Airlines will start offering its NDC content through
Amadeus from January 2021.

In 2020, we signed our first distribution agreement with Priceline, one of North America’s leading online travel
agencies and a subsidiary of industry giant Booking Holdings Inc.

Mauritania Airlines, Air Tahiti, Azerbaijan Airlines, TAAG Angola, Air Senegal and STARLUX Airlines completed
their migration to the Altéa platform, while JSX was implemented to New Skies.

Alaska Airlines became the first airline in the world to implement Amadeus Revenue Management as a non-Altéa
assenger service system carrier. Additionally, Alaska Airlines is among the first airlines in the world to benefit
rom a new revenue forecast model created by Amadeus - Active Forecast Adjustment (AFA). The model helps
airlines adapt their revenue management systems to fluctuating air travel demand as it adjusts forecasts across
all departure dates based on the latest live sales data.

We remained active on our upselling efforts during 2020. In April, All Nippon Airways (ANA) announced that it
ad implemented Amadeus Airline Cloud Availability. ANA is also the first airline to take advantage of Interactive
Codeshare through Amadeus Cloud Availability solution, which means that it can process availability interactively
with codeshare partners. In August, we signed an agreement with Turkish Airlines to improve their digital
shopping experience. The airline, an Amadeus Flex Pricer customer, has signed for additional shopping solutions
rom Amadeus’ Offer Suite, including Amadeus Massive and Instant Search and Amadeus Ticket Changer
Reissue, Shopper and Refund. In December, Gulf Air, contracted for Amadeus Rich Merchandising. Qantas
successfully implemented Personalized Merchandizing and Personalized Servicing as part of its implementation
of Amadeus Customer Experience Management.

Hospitality

We continued to expand our portfolio of customers for our Hospitality solutions, while also expanding the
collaboration with existing ones. In November, we signed an agreement with Meeting Point Hotels, which is part
of the FTI Group, to adopt the new Amadeus Integrated Booking Suite, which includes Amadeus’ iHotelier Central
Reservations System, Guest Management Solutions and Web.

We also expanded our strategic partnership with Accor hoteliers to include the use of Demand360. With this
new agreement, Accor will recommend Demand360 for use in its properties and work with Amadeus to increase
adoption across the organization’s brand portfolio, which includes more than 5,000 hotels and 39 brands across
110 countries.

In October, we also renewed and expanded of our business intelligence partnership with Hilton. The hotel chain
will continue to recommend Amadeus Demand360, Rate360 and Agency360 to its properties. Also, as part of
the new deal, Demand360 will be the exclusive provider of forward-looking data integrated into the Hilton
Revenue Management System (GRO). Finally, the hotel chain will also encourage hotels in their portfolio to use
Amadeus GDS Advertising services.

In December 2020, we renewed our partnership with InterContinental Hotels Group. IHG will continue using
Amadeus industry-leading Hotelligence360 Business Intelligence solutions and will extend the recommendation
for hotels to use Demand360, Agency360 and RevenueStrategy360 which have been enhanced with additiona
solution capabilities, including access to the new Amadeus Recovery Insights tool for corporate users.

We also signed an agreement with Sunway Hotels & Resorts, one of Asia’s most prominent international hote
groups, for Amadeus’ iHotelier Central Reservation System, Guest Management Solutions and Website
Management Solutions. And Grupo Posadas contracted our web services solution for 33 of its properties.

In December, we partnered again with Booking.com and Conferma Pay to allow business travelers to simplify
the checkout payment process. Thanks to this alliance, when business travel is arranged through Amadeus Hotel
Billback solutions, the business travelers will not have to pay with their credit card. Conferma Pay automatically
generates a virtual card number, which Booking.com then sends on to the property. At checkout, the property
charges the booking to the virtual card, and the booking and payment data is then reconciled. Amadeus
facilitates and enables the communication between Conferma Pay and Booking.com. The number o’
Booking.com properties available to be paid following this procedure has increased from 20% to 80%.

Airport IT

We had several contract wins in our Airport IT business during 2020, particularly related to touchless technology,
which is helping our airport customers adapt to the new social distancing rules. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood
International Airport, a customer of our airport suite, contracted for Amadeus Biometric Boarding.

In July, we announced that Avinor, the firm operating Norway's 44 state-owned airports, contracted touchless
check-in and bag drop technology from the ICM Amadeus portfolio for several its properties.

Stuttgart Airport completed a successful migration to the Amadeus Airport Cloud Use Service (ACUS) platform,
at more than 200 check-in counters and self-boarding gates, as well as the installation of 30 Amadeus self-service
check-in kiosks, for a smoother check-in experience. The airport has also adopted Amadeus’ technology for
payments.

Nashville International Airport, an Amadeus Airport Operational Database and Resource Management System
customer, implemented airline agent-facing common use passenger processing technology and Common Use
self service kiosks.

Salt Lake City Airport chose Amadeus to help it manage the current flow of traffic at its extended facilities, while
also adapting to future demand. The airport contracted Airport Operational Database, Resource Management
Systems, Flight Information Display System, EASE Common Use check-in boarding and Self-Service Kiosks.

Payments

In December, we announced a new currency conversion module, the first of the solutions from a suite of new
foreign exchange (FX) services called ‘FX Box’. The solution allows travel agencies and airlines to offer customers
the possibility to see ticket prices in the currency of their choice. For many travel companies today, currency
conversion is handled by third parties in the payment chain. By re-engineering the way payments are presented
and managed from authorization to settlement, FX Box can help to empower travel suppliers to internalize the
proceeds of a cross-currency payment and generate significant savings. Amadeus is currently working to add
more foreign exchange providers so that travel companies can select their preferred partner, with Citibank being
the first available on the platform

Other

In November, it was announced that for the ninth consecutive year Amadeus IT Group, S.A. had been selected
as an index component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe and World Indices. Our long term continuity in
the index is proof of Amadeus commitment to ESG.

During 2020, we made some changes to our Executive Committee. In September, we announced the
appointment of Mr. Till Streichert as new Chief Financial Officer (CFO), replacing Ana de Pro. In December we
announced that Mr. Stefan Ropers, Senior Vice-President Strategic Growth Business, will take up a new role
outside of Amadeus in 2021 and Ms. Julia Sattel, Senior Vice-President Airline IT, after a 25-year career in the
Company, will leave Amadeus effective December 31, 2020, to continue focusing on activities related to the
tourism industry. The functions of both executives have been assumed by the other members of the Executive
Committee.

3. Presentation of financial information

The audited consolidated financial statements of Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and subsidiaries are the source to the
financial information included in this document and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.

(millions of euros)

Certain amounts and figures included in this report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Any discrepancies
in any tables between the totals and the sums of the amounts listed are due to rounding.

Alternative Performance Measures

This document includes unaudited Alternative Performance Measures such as EBITDA, operating income, net
financial debt as defined by our credit facility agreements, adjusted profit and their corresponding ratios. These
Alternative Performance Measures have been prepared in accordance with the Guidelines issued by the European
Securities and Markets Authority for regulated information published on or after July 3, 2016.

Segment contribution is defined as the segment revenue less operating costs plus capitalizations directly
allocated to the segment. A reconciliation to EBITDA is included in section 5.3.

EBITDA corresponds to Operating income plus D&A expense. A reconciliation of EBITDA to Operating income is
included in section 5.3. The Operating income calculation is displayed in section 5.

Adjusted profit corresponds to reported profit for the period, after adjusting for: (i) accounting effects derive
from PPA exercises and impairment losses, (ii) non-operating exchange gains (losses), and (iii) other non-
operating, non-recurring items, as detailed in section 5.6.1.

Net financial debt as defined by our credit facility agreements is calculated as current and non-current debt (as
per the financial statements), less cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for non-debt items (such as deferre
financing fees, accrued interest and fair value adjustments to an EIB loan). A reconciliation to the financia
statements is included in section 6.5.

Underlying performance view

The underlying financial performance column displayed in this document adjusts for the reduction in revenues ani
cost of revenue associated with the higher than usual cancellations associated with COVID-19. Revenues related to
airline reservations are recorded at the time the reservation is made, net of estimated future cancellations. Booking
fees are contingent on the occurrence of a future event, that is, the cancellation. Cancellations also impact incentives
paid to travel agencies (accounted for within the Cost of revenue caption), which are also recorded net of estimate:
future cancellations. Historically, definitive cancellations were infrequent, however travel restrictions imposed by
governments and other COVID-19 related negative impacts on the travel industry have raised the cancellation ratio
and obliged to update the cancellation reserve.

In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in the expected credit losses on financia
assets (bad debt provision) due to the change in the provision matrix and the reassessment of the credit risk of some
customers. For comparison purposes, the underlying financial performance column information excludes bad debt
effects from both the 2020 and the 2019 results.

Cost savings program implementation costs

In the second half of 2020, we incurred one-time costs amounting to €169.1 million (€120.9 million post tax), related
to the implementation of the cost savings program announced in the second quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter,
these one-time costs amounted to €93.4 million (€66.4 million post tax). These costs mainly correspond to
severances. For purposes of comparability with 2019, figures shown in section 5 have been adjusted to exclude these
costs. A reconciliation of these figures to the financial statements is provided below.

We believe that these Alternative Performance Measures and the Underlying Performance view provide useful and
relevant information to facilitate a better understanding of the performance of Amadeus and its economic position.
These measures and views are not standard and therefore may not be comparable to those presented by other
companies.

3.1 ICM Airport Technics acquisition

On May 31, 2019, Amadeus acquired ICM Group Holding Limited and its group of companies (‘ICM’), for €40.1
million. ICM, headquartered in Sydney, Australia, specializes in the provision of passenger automation and self-
service bag drop solutions for customers, principally in Asia-Pacific and Europe. The ICM results were consolidated
into Amadeus’ books from June 1, 2019.

A purchase price allocation exercise in relation to the consolidation of ICM into Amadeus’ books was carried out
during the first half of 2020.

3.2 | Optym’s Sky Suite acquisition

On January 31, 2020, Amadeus acquired Sky Suite, the airline network planning software business of Optym, for
€36.2 million in cash. Optym and Amadeus have been partners for more than three years, jointly delivering solutions
to Southwest Airlines, easyJet and LATAM Airlines. The Amadeus Sky Suite will be further integrated into the

Amadeus Airline Platform, including software for network optimization and simulation, frequency and capacity
planning, network planning and forecasting, and a flight scheduling development platform. The Optym’s Sky Suite
results were consolidated into Amadeus’ books from January 31, 2020.

A purchase price allocation exercise in relation to the consolidation of Optym’s Sky Suite into Amadeus’ books was
carried out during the second quarter of 2020.

4. Main financial risks and hedging policy
4.1 Foreign exchange rate risk

Our reporting currency is the Euro. However, as a result of Amadeus’ global activity and presence, part of our results
are generated in currencies different from the Euro and therefore are impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations.
Similarly, part of our cash inflows and outflows are denominated in non-Euro currencies. As a consequence, both our
results and our cash flows are impacted, either positively or negatively, by foreign exchange fluctuations.

Exposure to foreign currencies

Our revenue is almost entirely generated either in Euro or in US Dollar (the latter representing 45%-55% of our total
revenue). Revenue generated in currencies other than the Euro or US Dollar is negligible.

In turn, 55%-65% of our operating costs’? are denominated in many currencies different from the Euro, including
the US Dollar, which represents 30%-40% of our operating costs. The rest of the foreign currency operating expenses
are denominated in a variety of currencies, GBP, AUD, INR, SGD and THB being the most significant. A number of
these currencies may fluctuate vs. the Euro similarly to the US Dollar - Euro fluctuations, and the degree of this
correlation may vary with time.

Hedging policy
Amadeus’ target is to reduce the volatility generated by foreign exchange fluctuations on its non-Euro denominated
net cash flows. Our hedging strategy is as follows:

To manage our exposure to the US Dollar, we have a natural hedge to our net operating cash flow generated in
US Dollar or US Dollar-correlated currencies through, among others, payments of USD-denominated debt (when
applicable), as well as investments and taxes paid in the U.S. We may enter into derivative arrangements when
this natural hedge is not sufficient to cover our outstanding exposure.

We also hedge a number of currencies, including the GBP, AUD, INR and SEK, for which we enter into foreign
exchange derivatives with banks.

When the hedges in place covering operating flows qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS, profits and losses are
recognized within EBITDA. Our hedging arrangements typically qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS.

In 2020, foreign exchange fluctuations had a broadly neutral impact on revenue, costs and EBITDA. In the fourth
quarter, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue, a positive impact on costs and a neutral
impact on EBITDA.

4.2 Interest rate risk

Our target is to reduce volatility in net interest flows. In order to achieve this objective, Amadeus may enter into
interest rate hedging agreements (interest rate swaps, caps, collars) to cover the floating rate debt.

1 Including Cost of revenue, Personnel expenses and Other operating expenses. Excludes Depreciation and amortization.

At December 31, 2020, 21% of our total financial debt" (related to the European Commercial Paper Program and
one Eurobond issue) was subject to floating interest rates, indexed to the EURIBOR. As of this date, no interest rate
hedges were in place.

4.3, Ownshares price evolution risk
Amadeus has three different staff remuneration schemes which are settled with Amadeus’ shares.

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature all beneficiaries will receive a number of Amadeus shares
which for the outstanding plans amount to (depending on the evolution of certain performance conditions), between
a minimum of 335,000 shares and a maximum of 1,402,000 shares, approximately. It is Amadeus’ intention to make
use of its treasury shares to settle these plans at their maturity.

Cost savings program implementation costs

In 2020, Amadeus incurred costs amounting to €169.1 million (€120.9 million post tax) related to the implementation
of the cost savings program announced in the second quarter of 2020. These costs amounted to €93.4 million (€66.4

Presentation of Underlying performance view
In 2020, Amadeus’ results were also impacted by the following effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Higher than usual air booking cancellations ratio to gross bookings, starting from March, since the COVID-19
health situation spread across the globe. The higher than usual booking cancellations rate resulted in a reduction

of revenue, as well as in cost of revenue, partially offset by the booking cancellation provision’®. Both effects
combined (above historical average booking cancellations and the cancellation provision) had a negative impact
of €49.0 million on revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 (€455.7 million in the full year), and a positive impact
of €10.7 million on cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 (€184.3 million in the full year). Excluding both
effects, our revenue declined by 61.0% and 52.8% in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively, and
cost of revenue declined by 80.6% and 67.8% in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively.

An increase in the bad debt provision, negatively impacting the Other operating expenses cost line, driven by (i)
the reassessment of the credit risk of some customers that became high risk customers in accordance with our
default definition, and (ii) the changes in the provision matrix, in the context of COVID-19. The bad debt provision
increased by €5.2 million and €70.1 million in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively (increasing
by €12.8 million and €37.1 million in the fourth quarter and the full year 2019, respectively). Excluding bad debt,
Other operating expenses declined by 70.2% and 51.7%, in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020,
respectively.

The combination of the unusually high level of air booking cancellations ratio to gross bookings and the increase
in bad debt provision had a negative impact on EBITDA of €43.5 million and €341.5 million in the fourth quarter
and the full year 2020, respectively. Excluding both effects, as well as the implementation costs related to our
cost savings programs, EBITDA declined by 84.8% and 74.9%, in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020,
respectively.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, impairment charges amounted to €58.8 million (€139.6 million in the full year),
and were related to some customers ceasing operations or cancelling contracts, as well as to some assets that
will not deliver the expected benefits over the same timeframe as before. If we exclude impairment charges
from the 2020 and 2019 results (which amounted to €6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and €29.2 million
in the full year 2019), D&A expense declined by 18.8% in the fourth quarter and 5.2% in the full year 2020.

Upfront bank fees in relation to the bridge to bond facility signed in March and the convertible bond issued in
April 2020, raised the net financial expense by €0.9 million and €5.9 million in the fourth quarter and the full year
2020, respectively.

Excluding the (post-tax) effects mentioned above, as well as the implementation costs related to our cost savings
programs, Profit (Loss) for the fourth quarter and the full year declined by 130.8% and 113.1% vs. 2019,
respectively, and Adjusted profit (loss) declined by 119.7% and 103.9% for the fourth quarter and the full year
vs. 2019, respectively.

°5 As a general rule, when a travel agency air booking is cancelled, Amadeus cancels both the booking fee billed to the airline (accounting for it as less
revenue) and the incentive fee to be provided to the travel agency (accounting for it as less cost of revenue). As per IFRS, we estimate the amount of
variable consideration from travel agency air bookings which may be cancelled in future periods. Accounts receivable are recorded net of a cancellation
reserve and accounts payable are recorded net of the reduction in distribution costs derived from cancellations. Adjustments to this provision impact
both the revenue and cost of revenue captions. See further detail on this adjustment in section 3.

5.1 Revenue

In the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue amounted to €474.3 million, a decline of 64.6% vs. prior year. Fourth quarter
revenue continued to be impacted by the low levels of air traffic, as well as a higher than usual level of air booking
cancellations relative to gross bookings, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the effects from the higher
level of cancellations and related movements in the cancellation provision’®, our underlying revenue declined by
61.0% in the fourth quarter. This underlying group revenue evolution in the fourth quarter resulted from segment
revenue underlying declines of 71.2% and 48.5% in Distribution and IT Solutions revenue, respectively.

In 2020, revenue amounted to €2,174.0 million, a decline of 61.0% vs. prior year. Excluding the effect from the higher

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Amadeus travel agency air bookings contracted by 79.4% vs. the same period in 2019,
an improvement from the 89.8% air booking decline we saw in the third quarter, on the back of enhanced gross
booking growth rates and a continued slow down in the level of cancellations. Improvements in the booking growth
rates compared to the third quarter of the year were seen across regions. Latin America and Middle East and Africa

were the regions where volume performance improved the most relative to prior quarter, as several key countries
in these regions eased restrictions and allowed for international travel. Booking growth also improved in North
America, although this region showed some volatility across the quarter provoked by the effects of elevated COVID-
19 cases and the elections. On the other hand, both Asia-Pacific and Europe reported softer improvements vs. the
previous quarter, impacted by the resurgence of the virus and associated restrictions.

In 2020, Amadeus travel agency air bookings fell by 81.5%. Air volumes started to trend down in February and
deteriorated further from March, as the COVID-19 health crisis spread beyond Asia and was declared a pandemic.
After reaching a low in April and May, with cancellations exceeding gross bookings, volumes turned positive from
mid-June and improved sequentially since then, every quarter, on the back of enhanced gross booking growth rates
and a slow down in the level of cancellations.

Amadeus’ non air bookings decreased by 68.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020, or by 56.0% in the full-year period,
caused by the overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global travel industry. Volume declines
reported in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020 (-56.8%) deteriorated across our non-air
products, mainly due to a worsening of the rail booking volumes in Europe and the hospitality industry in the U.S.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Distribution revenue declined by 77.9%, driving a full year revenue decline of 77.1%,
vs. previous year. The Distribution revenue contraction was the result of the declining booking volumes from
February 2020, impacted by the pandemic. Distribution revenue per booking increased, both in the fourth quarter
and the full year 2020, compared to 2019, supported by (i) a positive revenue impact from the cancellation provision
and from solutions supporting processes related to ticketing and cancellations, and (ii) contractions in other revenue
lines, albeit at softer rates than the travel agency bookings decline, such as revenues from travel agency IT solutions.

These positive effects offset the negative impact from the higher weight of local bookings, impacted by the faster
recovery in domestic air traffic compared to international air traffic.

Excluding the impact from the higher than usual booking cancellations relative to gross bookings, as well as related
movements in the cancellation provision, the underlying Distribution revenue declined by 71.2% and by 62.6% in the

2 Includes the impact from 2019 and 2020 migrations, partly offset by the effects from airlines ceasing or suspending operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Amadeus passengers boarded decreased by 72.4% to 137.4 million. This PB
performance represented an enhancement over the 74.9% PB decline in the third quarter of the year. All regions
except Europe reported improvements in PB performance, most notably Latin America and Middle East and Africa,
where large countries such as Brazil or South Africa eased mobility restrictions. Europe volume growth deteriorated
in the fourth quarter, relative to the third quarter, impacted by the resurgence of the virus and associated
restrictions.

In 2020, Amadeus passengers boarded declined by 65.4%, severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. After
reaching a low in April, the Amadeus PB evolution improved sequentially, every quarter, and across most regions.

Amadeus PB volumes in the 2020 full year included those of customers implemented in 2019, such as Philippine
Airlines, Bangkok Airways, Air Canada, Air Europa and FlyOne, and in 2020, such as Azerbaijan Airlines, Mauritania
Airlines, STARLUX Airlines, Air Tahiti, JSX, TAAG Angola and Air Senegal. These customer implementations, pre-
COVID-19, would have added approximately 114 million PB annually. On the other hand, Amadeus PB were also
impacted by airline customers ceasing or suspending operations in 2019, such as Germania and bmi Regional (both
in February), Avianca Brasil (in May), Avianca Argentina (in June), and Thomas Cook UK, Aigle Azur, Adria Airways and
XL Airways France (all in September), and in 2020, such as Flybe (in March) and Tiger Airways Australia (in
September). These customers, pre-COVID-19, accounted for approximately 46 million PB annually.

solutions, merchandizing and personalization tools, and revenue optimization and disruption management software,
among others, and (ii) our Airport IT and Payments IT (the Merchant Hub offering) businesses.

IT transactional revenue decreased by 47.2% in 2020, driven by a reduction in PB volumes. IT Transactional revenue
per PB increased in the year, supported by (i) revenue contractions in Airport IT and Payments IT, albeit at a softer
rate than the decline in PB, positively impacted by the performance of revenue lines not directly linked to volumes,
as well as new customer implementations, and (ii) the positive contribution from upselling activity in Airline IT
(including solutions such as revenue optimization, disruption management, merchandizing and personalization).

7 Note, the ‘transactional’ concept herein is based on management view, and is not related with IFRS15.

Direct distribution revenue

Direct distribution revenue mainly includes fees charged for bookings made through the direct sales channel of an
airline using our Altéa Reservation solution and for certain types of bookings made through the direct sales channel
of Altéa customers, for which we charge a booking fee, not a PB fee. It also includes several solutions related to the
booking process.

In 2020, revenue from direct distribution decreased by 67.9%, driven by a booking volume decline.

Airline services and Hospitality IT revenue

This caption mainly comprises (i) the provision of bespoke and consulting services, (ii) the recognition of deferred
customization and implementation fees of our solutions, and (iii) our Hospitality IT solutions business.

Airline services and Hospitality IT revenue declined by 21.3% in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the
overall travel industry. The revenue evolution was supported by the resiliency provided by non-volume driven
revenues, such as sales and catering and business intelligence within Hospitality IT, and customer implementations
across both airline services and Hospitality IT businesses.

5.2. Group operating costs

5.2.1 Cost of revenue

These costs are mainly related to: (i) incentive fees paid to travel sellers for bookings done through our reservations
platforms, (ii) distribution fees paid to local commercial organizations which act as a local distributor (mainly in the
Middle East, North Africa, India, and South Korea), (iii) data communication expenses related to the maintenance of
our computer network, including connection charges, (iv) fees paid in relation to advertising and data analytics
activities in Hospitality, and (v) commissions paid to travel agencies for the use of our payments distribution solutions.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, cost of revenue amounted to €56.6 million, a 83.7% decline vs. the same period of
2019. In 2020, cost of revenue amounted to €276.6 million, a reduction of 80.7% vs. 2019.

Cost of revenue in 2020 has been impacted by a sharp reduction in gross air booking volumes, as well as higher than
usual air booking cancellations relative to gross bookings, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as detailed in section 5.1.1,
partially offset by our booking cancellation provision’. Excluding the effects from the higher than usual cancellations
and the cancellation provision, cost of revenue declined by 80.6% in the fourth quarter (by 67.8% in the full year),
driven by the air booking evolution.

5.2.2 Personnel and related expenses and other operating expenses

A large number of Amadeus’ employees are software engineers. Amadeus has also historically hired contractors to
support development activity, complementing permanent staff, providing flexibility to increase or reduce our
development activity. The overall ratio of permanent staff vs. contractors devoted to R&D has fluctuated depending
on business needs and project mix, therefore impacting the evolution of both ‘Personnel expenses’ and ‘Other
operating expenses’ captions in our income statement.

Resulting from our fixed cost reduction plan announced in the second quarter of 2020, we have undertaken a
number of measures, including a reduction of our permanent staff and contractor base. This has supported a

28 As a general rule, when a travel agency air booking is cancelled, Amadeus cancels both the booking fee billed to the airline (accounting for it as less
revenue) and the incentive fee to be provided to the travel agency (accounting for it as less cost of revenue). As per IFRS, we estimate the amount of
variable consideration from travel agency air bookings which may be cancelled in future periods. Accounts receivable are recorded net of a cancellation
reserve and accounts payable are recorded net of the reduction in distribution costs derived from cancellations. Adjustments to this provision impact
both the revenue and cost of revenue captions. See further detail on this adjustment in section 3.

reduction of our combined operating expenses cost line, including both Personnel and Other operating expenses, by
24.7% and 12.5%, in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively (excluding cost savings programs
implementation costs). Our fixed cost base was impacted by an increase in the bad debt provision, driven by (i) the
reassessment of the credit risk of some customers that became high risk customers in accordance with our default
definition, and (ii) an increase in our Expected Credit Losses provision, in the context of COVID-19. The bad debt
provision increased by €5.2 million and €70.1 million in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively (€12.8
million and €37.1 million in the fourth quarter and the full year 2019, respectively). Excluding bad debt effects and
cost savings programs implementation costs, our combined operating expenses cost line declined by 23.9% and
14.5%, in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively.

5.2.3 Depreciation and amortization

In 2020, depreciation and amortization expense amounted to €829.4 million, an increase of 9.6% vs. the same period
of 2019. This increase was mainly driven by impairment losses amounting to €139.6 million, related to some
customers ceasing operations or cancelling contracts, as well as some assets that in this environment are not
expected to deliver the benefits over the same timeframe as before, due to the COVID-19 impact on the travel
industry. Excluding impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense declined by 5.2% in 2020, mostly due
to a decrease in amortization from purchase price allocation exercises, driven by certain assets which reached the
end of their useful lives at the end of the second quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, depreciation and
amortization expense amounted to €215.4 million, 8.0% higher than the same period of 2019, impacted by higher
impairment losses, as per the above.

programs, EBITDA declined by 84.8% and 74.9% in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively.

EBITDA evolution in the full year period (excluding cost savings programs implementation costs) was driven by:
An 89.1% decrease in Distribution contribution (representing a -68.4% underlying evolution, pre cancellations

and bad debt effects), resulting from a decline in revenue of 77.1%, as explained in section 5.1.1 above, and a

67.4% reduction in net operating costs, which mainly resulted from (i) a decline in variable costs, driven by the
booking volume evolution, and (ii) a reduction in net fixed costs, impacted by our cost reduction measures.

A 54.2% contraction in our IT Solutions contribution (a -51.9% underlying evolution, pre bad debt effects) as a

result of a 40.2% revenue decrease, as explained in section 5.1.2, and a 15.1% net operating costs reduction,

5.4 Net financial expense

In the fourth quarter of 2020, net financial expense amounted to an expense of €31.5 million, an increase of 104.7%
vs. the same period of 2019. This variation was mainly driven by a 137.0% interest expense increase, as a
consequence of both a higher average gross debt outstanding and a higher average cost of debt, driven by the new
financings.

In 2020, net financial expense increased by 72.4% vs. 2019, mostly driven by the €35.4 million, or 84.4%, increase in
interest expense. €5.9 million of such increase was due to financing fees recognized through the P&L in the second,
third and fourth quarters”, in relation to the bridge to bond facility signed in March and the convertible bond issued
in April this year. The balance of the interest expense increase of €29.6 million in 2020 was caused by both a higher
average gross debt outstanding and a higher average cost of debt, as a consequence of the new financings. See
section 6.6 for details on our debt structure.

5.5 Income taxes

In 2020, income taxes (adjusted to exclude €48.2 million tax income impact from costs related to the implementation
of the cost savings programs) amounted to an income of €208.2 million. The Group income tax rate for the period
was 29.5%, higher than 21.8% income tax rate reported in 2019. This increase in the tax rate comes from the effect
of tax deductions (associated with R&D) in the context of a negative taxable income result.

In 2020, Reported profit (adjusted to exclude post-tax costs amounting to €120.9 million, incurred in the second half
of 2020, related to the implementation of the cost savings program announced in the second quarter of 2020)
amounted to losses of €505.3 million, a contraction of 145.4% vs. 2019. Excluding also the (post-tax) effects from
booking cancellations, bad debt and impairments derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as from upfront fees
in relation to the bridge to bond facility signed in March 2020 and the convertible bond issued in April 2020, reported
profit declined by 113.1% in 2020. In turn, Adjusted profit decreased by 123.9% to a loss of €302.4 million in the full
year period, or by 103.9% if (post-tax) effects from booking cancellations, bad debt, impairments, upfront financing
fees and cost savings programs implementation costs are excluded.

1° Financing fees are deferred in the balance sheet and recognized through P&L over the term of the associated debt.

If we exclude the (post-tax) effects from booking cancellations, bad debt and impairments derived from the COVID-
19 pandemic, as well as from upfront fees in relation to the bridge to bond facility signed in March 2020 and the
convertible bond issued in April 2020, and costs related to the implementation of our cost savings programs, EPS and

6.1 Intangible assets

This caption principally includes the cost of acquisition or development, as well as the excess purchase price allocated
to, patents, trademarks and licenses20, technology and content21 and contractual relationships22, net of
amortization.

Intangible assets amounted to €3,946.9 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of €240.9 million vs. December
31, 2019. This decrease was mainly the result of the combination of the following effects: (i) additions of internally
developed software (+€455.0 million), (ii) the addition of assets mainly from purchase price allocation exercises in
relation to the ICM’s and Optym’s consolidation (+€45.4 million, net of amortization), (iii) amortization charges and
impairment losses (-€626.4 million) and (iv) foreign exchange effects (-€110.3 million).

6.2 Goodwill

Goodwill mainly relates to the unallocated amount of the excess purchase price derived from (i) the business
combination (acquisition) between Amadeus IT Group, S.A. (the currently listed company, formerly named Amadeus
IT Holding, S.A. or WAM Acquisition, S.A.) and Amadeus IT Group, S.A. (the former listed company in 2005) in 2005,
and (ii) acquisitions, most of them completed between 2014 and 2018.

Goodwill amounted to €3,539.8 million as of December 31, 2020. Goodwill decreased by €121.7 million in 2020,
mainly due to the adjustments of non-Euro denominated balances to exchange rates at December 31, 2020.

6.3. Property, plant and equipment (PP&E)

This caption principally includes land and buildings, data processing hardware and software, and other PP&E assets
such as building installations, furniture and fittings and miscellaneous.

year 2020, respectively. Excluding the €34.1 million cost savings program implementation costs paid in the year
(€31.6 million in the fourth quarter), free cash flow amounted to -€181.9 million and -€507.8 million in the fourth
quarter and the full year 2020, respectively.

7.1. Change in working capital

Change in working capital amounted to an outflow of €6.6 million in the fourth quarter and an inflow of €11.0 million
in the full year 2020. Change in working capital, both in the fourth quarter and in the full year 2020, was positively
impacted by costs related to the implementation of the cost savings program announced in the second quarter of
2020, incurred in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, not paid yet. These unpaid costs amounted to €61.8

m

illion and €135.0 million in the fourth quarter and the full year 2020, respectively. Excluding them, change in

working capital amounted to an outflow of €68.4 million and €124.0 million in the fourth quarter and the full year

2020, respectively.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, change in working capital excluding the implementation cost effect mentioned above,
deteriorated by €122.5 million vs. the same period of 2019. This deterioration was primarily caused by (i) payments.
amounting to c.€120 million that had been delayed from previous quarters, related to social security, payroll taxes
and employee bonus, and (ii) a decrease in the net inflow resulting from higher collections and payments from
previous periods vs. revenues and expenses accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to the same
period of 2019, resulting from the activity deceleration. This effect was partly offset by payments, amounting to

(millions of euros)

€34.3 million, advanced from January 2020 to December 2019, negatively impacting change in working capital in the
fourth quarter of 2019.

In 2020, Change in working capital excluding the implementation cost effect deteriorated by €28.9 million vs. 2019,
mainly due to a net outflow resulting from higher collections and payments from previous periods vs. revenues and
expenses accounted for in 2020, compared to a net inflow in 2019, caused by the activity deceleration in 2020. This
effect was partly offset by timing differences in collections and payments, including (i) payments, amounting to €34.3
million, advanced from January 2020 to December 2019, and (ii) c.€13 million social security payments delayed to
2021 and 2022.

7.2 Capital expenditure, R&D investment

Capital expenditure

The table below details the capital expenditure, both in relation to property, plant and equipment (‘PP&E’) and to
intangible assets. Based on the nature of our investments in PP&E, the figures may show variations on a quarterly
basis, depending on the timing of certain investments. The same applies to our investments in contractual
relationships where payments to travel agencies may take place in different periods, based on the timing of the
negotiations. In turn, our capitalized R&D investment may fluctuate depending on the level of capitalization ratio,
which is impacted by the intensity of the development activity, the mix of projects undertaken and the different
stages of the various projects.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, capex declined by €76.5 million, or 39.8%, vs. the same period of 2019, driving
a full year capex decrease of €234.6 million, or 31.9%.

In the year, capex in intangible assets decreased by €184.5 million, or 28.7%, as a result of:

Lower capitalizations from software development, driven by (i) a 18.3% decline in R&D investment, resulting
from the COVID-19 impact on our business, in response to which we have started prioritizing our most strategic
and important projects over others and also postponing more long-term initiatives, and (ii) a lower capitalization
ratio, due to project mix, including, among others, a higher weight of R&D investment devoted to airline bespoke
services, which is not capitalized.

measures put in place in the period.

7.3 Cash taxes

In 2020, cash taxes amounted to €36.6 million, a reduction of €298.7 million vs. €335.3 million taxes paid in 2019. In
the fourth quarter, cash taxes amounted to €12.1 million, a decrease of €96.9 million vs. the same period of 2019.
The three-month and full year variations vs. 2019 mostly resulted from (i) a reduction in prepaid taxes on 2020
taxable income, driven by the contraction in the financial results expected for 2020 vs. 2019, and, to a lesser extent,
(ii) an increase in tax reimbursements from previous years.

74 Interest and financial fees paid

In 2020, interest and financial fees paid amounted to €73.5 million, an increase of €38.0 million vs. 2019, driven by
upfront financing fees paid in relation to the new financing and the issuance of convertible bonds, amounting to
€37.3 million.

75 Equity investments

Equity investments amounting to €39.4 million in 2020 and €46.2 in 2019 mainly related to Optym’s Sky Suite’s and
ICM’s acquisitions, respectively, as detailed in section 3.

7.6 Non-operating items

In 2020, cash outflow from non-operating items amounted to €36.2 million, and mostly responded to (i) hedging
costs and results, mainly in relation to a USD-denominated intercompany loan, linked to TravelClick’s acquisition, and
(ii) the adjustment of USD-denominated cash to the USD-Euro FX rate at December 31, 2020. In the fourth quarter,
the cash inflow of €41.2 million posted in this caption mainly corresponds to results from FX hedges on USD-
denominated cash equivalents.

9. Other additional information
9.1 Expected Business Evolution
9.1.1. Macroeconomic environment

Given that Amadeus operates transaction-based business models, our operating results are highly linked to travel
volumes (mainly bookings made by travel agencies connected to the Amadeus Distribution system, or passengers
boarded by airlines using our IT solutions) at a global scale. Amadeus’ businesses and operations are largely
dependent on the evolution of the worldwide travel and tourism industry, which is sensitive to general economic
conditions and trends.

In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on the economy and the travel industry,
and it is difficult to predict how travel volumes will evolve during the year. An improvement on 2020 is expected,
thanks to more established testing protocols and the launch of vaccination programs. However, in December 2020,
the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that air traffic in 2021 will be 50%”? below 2019 levels
(vs. -66% in 2020 over 2019). By region, with respect to 2019, IATA estimates: Africa (-62%), Asia-Pacific (-43%),
Middle East (-61%), Latin America (-50%), North America (-45%) and Europe (-56%). More recently, in February 2021,
ATA published a downside risk to their forecast, indicating that 2021 air traffic could be limited to -62%* vs. 2019
levels, if more severe travel restrictions in response to new variants persist.

9.1.2 Amadeus strategic priorities and expected business evolution in 2021

Amadeus is a leading technology provider for the travel industry. Amadeus has built commercial relationships wit!
layers across the industry, including airlines, travel agencies, hotels and airports, among others, and across the globe
(with presence in more than 190 countries). Amadeus has invested consistently over the years to have a unique
technology offering. Having market leading technology allows us to serve our customers better, to customize more
efficiently and to continue innovating.

n 2021, the performance in all our business units will depend on the evolution of the COVID -19 pandemic and the
recovery of the travel industry. We expect to maintain our leadership positions in both Distribution and Airline IT,
supported by our focus on R&D, local market understanding and travel industry expertise.

n Distribution, the Amadeus Travel Platform continues to bring together travel content from different sources,
including NDC content, as evidenced by our recent agreement with Air France KLM. In Airline IT, we will continue to
enhance and expand our solutions portfolio, in areas such as NDC, revenue optimization, network planning and data
analytics. In Hospitality we are further advancing with the integration of our portfolio to create a hospitality leader
that offers a broad range of innovative solutions to hotels and chains of all sizes across the globe.

Investing in technology is a key pillar to our success. In 2021, while investment will be prioritized and closely managed,
Amadeus will maintain investment in R&D to support long term growth, such as new customer implementations,
product evolution, portfolio expansion (including non-air IT diversification) and cross-area technological projects. We
will continue investing for our NDC vision, which consists of an integrated solution that can be widely adopted by
both travel agencies and airlines to deliver sustainable results on a scale that matters. Also, we will progress on our
shift to next-generation technologies and cloud services, as well as the application of new technologies, such as
artificial intelligence and machine learning.

9.4 — Other financial risks
9.4.1 Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial asset will cause a loss for the Group by failing to discharge an
obligation.

The Group cash and cash equivalents are deposited in major banks on the basis of diversification and the credit risk
of the available investment alternatives.

In 2020 the Group has made some short-term financial investments, in order to invest part of the liquidity raised
through the several financings undertaken during the year. These short-term investments are denominated in USD
and are fully hedged from foreign exchange variations. These investments consist of a tri-party repo amounting to
USD 755.0 million and a Trade Finance Fund amounting to USD 350.0 million. We consider that these investments
have a low credit risk since:

the tri-party repo could be liquidated at the end of March 2021 and it has the double guarantee of a diversified
portfolio of financial instruments acting as underlying and the bank acting as the counterparty of the transaction.
The counterparty bank is a prime investment grade global bank. The portfolio of assets underlying is valued by a
third party (Euroclear) and matched on daily basis in order to reach at least 75% of the value of the investment.

in the case of the Trade Finance Fund, this fund is invested in a diversified portfolio of receivables shorter than
3 months being the obligors US investment grade companies.

The credit risk of the Group’s customer accounts receivable is mitigated by the fact that the majority are settled
through the clearing houses operated by the International Air Transport Association (‘IATA’) and Airlines Clearing
House, Inc. (‘ACH’). These systems guarantee that the cash inflows from our customers will be settled at a certain
fixed date, and partially mitigate the credit risk by the fact that the members of the clearing house are required to
make deposits that would be used in the event of default. Moreover, our customer base is large and unrelated which
results in a low concentration of the credit risk.

9.4.2 Liquidity risk

The Corporate Treasury is responsible for providing the cash needed by all the companies of the Group. In order to
perform this task more efficiently, the Company concentrates the excess liquidity of the subsidiaries and channel it
to the companies with cash needs.

This allocation of the cash position among the companies of the Group is mainly made through:

Three different cash pooling agreements. One with most of the subsidiaries located in the euro area; another
one in US Dollars for the US subsidiaries and another one in British Pounds for the UK subsidiaries.

Through bilateral Treasury Optimization agreements between Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and its subsidiaries.

Corporate Treasury monitors the Group’s cash position through rolling forecasts of expected cash flows. These
forecasts are performed by the subsidiaries of the Group and later on consolidated in order to examine both the
liquidity situation and the prospects of the Group and its subsidiaries.

9.5 Subsequent events

On February 2, 2021, the Company has issued a bond for a nominal amount of €500.0 million. The bond has a
maturity of 2 years, although the Company has the option of total early redemption within 374 days from the closing
date since the issuance. It has a quarterly payable coupon with a variable interest rate of three-month Euribor plus
65 basis points. The amount issued will be used for general corporate financing needs. This new financing instrument
will gradually replace our Commercial Paper maturities.
