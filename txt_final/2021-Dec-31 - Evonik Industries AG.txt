FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK.

1.1 Business model

Evonik is one of the world’s leading specialty chemicals compa-
nies. Our strengths include the balanced spectrum of our busi-
ness activities, end-markets, and regions. Around 80 percent of
sales come from market-leading positions’, which we are sys-
tematically expanding. This strong competitive position is based
on collaboration with customers, innovative capability, and inte-
grated technology platforms.

Our specialty chemicals products make an indispensable contri-
bution to the benefits of our customers’ products, which gener-
ate their success in global competition. Close cooperation with
our customers enables us to build up a deep knowledge of their
business, so that we can offer products tailored to their specifica-
tions and extensive technical service. Our technology centers and
customer competence centers play an important role in this
around the world.

Market-oriented research and development is an important
driver of profitable growth. This is based on our strong innova-
tion culture, which is rooted in our innovation management and
management development.

Highly trained employees are a key success factor. They drive
forward Evonik on a daily basis through their hard work and
identification with the company. We have therefore developed a
wide range of activities to gain and develop talented and quali-
fied employees and to position Evonik as a preferred employer in
order to retain them.

As preconditions for Evonik’s future viability, we consider sus-
tainable business activities and responsible conduct to be the
cornerstones of our business model. Sustainability is an integral
part of our strategic management process. Our goal for the
future is to substantially increase the proportion of attractive
growth businesses in our portfolio with a clear focus on sustain-
ability (Next Generation Solutions). Foresighted resource man-
agement is another key element in our sustainability strategy. In
addition, we systematically examine the positive and negative
effects of our business activities along the value chain. Early
identification of future opportunities and risks makes our busi-
ness model more resilient and sharpens understanding of the
long-term value that our activities create for society.

Market-oriented corporate structure

Our specialty chemicals operations are divided into four chemical
manufacturing divisions, which operate close to their markets
and customers. The chemicals divisions—Specialty Additives,
Nutrition & Care, Smart Materials, and Performance Materials—
are clearly aligned to our technology platforms to allow more
selective management. They are supported by the Technology &
Infrastructure division.

The Specialty Additives, Nutrition & Care, and Smart Materials
divisions operate in attractive markets with above-average
growth rates. These three growth divisions offer customers cus-
tomized, innovation-driven solutions, and the aim is for them to
achieve above-average, profitable growth through innovations,
investments, and acquisitions.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

The Performance Materials division is characterized by processes
that make intensive use of energy and raw materials. It therefore
concentrates on integrated, cost-optimized technology platforms,
efficient workflows, and economies of scale. Our strategic goal
for this division is to contribute earnings to finance the growth of
the Evonik Group. Investments and, where appropriate, alliances
concentrate on securing our good market positions.

Broadly diversified end-customer markets

Most of our customers are industrial companies that use our
products for further processing. The range of markets in which
they operate is diverse and balanced. None of these end-markets

accounts for more than 20 percent of our sales. In view of its
focus on a broad spectrum of applications and its worldwide
presence, Evonik operates in a business environment with many
global and regional competitors. Since the chemical industry is
highly interconnected, competitors in one product area are often
customers of another product area.

Global production

Evonik has a presence in more than 100 countries, and 83 percent
of sales are generated outside Germany. We have production
facilities at 102 locations in 27 countries on six continents and are
therefore close to our markets and our customers. Our largest
production sites, for example, in Marl, Wesseling, and Rhein-
felden (Germany), Antwerp (Belgium), Mobile (Alabama, USA),
Shanghai (China), and Singapore, have integrated technology
platforms, most of which are used by several operating units.
Consequently, our procurement activities also have a global
focus. Raw materials and supplies, technical goods and services,
energy, and other operating supplies are sourced either region-
ally or globally.

Integrated technology platforms give us

a competitive advantage

Our products are manufactured using highly developed technol-
ogies that we are constantly refining. Evonik has many integrated
production complexes where key precursors are produced in
adjacent production facilities. In this way, we offer our customers
maximum reliability of supply. At the same time, integrated
world-scale production facilities combined with technologically
demanding production processes act as high entry barriers.

Digitalization contributes to profitable growth

Evonik started to address the digitalization of production and
business processes in the chemical industry at an early stage. We
are actively driving forward the digitalization of our production
sites: Antwerp (Belgium) is currently being established as a dig-
ital lighthouse location as a model for the digital transformation
of other sites. We are also introducing a digital energy manage-
ment system throughout the world. Our guiding principles for
digitalization set out how we intend to embrace people-centric.
We regard digitalization as a group-wide structural task and are
networking decentralized initiatives and bundling competencies
and methodological knowledge. The role of Evonik Digital
GmbH is to identify “uncharted territory” on the Evonik Group’s
digitalization map and promote the use of digital technologies
and data-based innovation processes. We are speeding up the
digitalization of our customer interfaces by establishing digital
platforms. In our view, digital innovations can pave the way for
new business models to help us establish a circular economy,
increase product and component life cycles, and endeavor to
reduce the consumption of resources at all stages in the value
chain.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

1.2 Principles and objectives

Building a best-in-class specialty chemicals company
We want to make Evonik a best-in-class specialty chemicals com-
pany. This global aspiration is closely linked to our goal of profit-
able growth. To increase the value of our company, our strategy
has three focal areas:

+ Amore balanced and more specialty portfolio

+ Leading in innovation

+ An open and performance-oriented culture.

Our goal is to step up our focus on businesses with clear specialty
chemicals characteristics. To ensure an even better balance
within our portfolio and to grow where Evonik is already strong
but there are especially promising prospects, our strategy con-
centrates on our three growth divisions: Specialty Additives,
Nutrition & Care, and Smart Materials. The focus is on high-
quality products and solutions, many of which also offer specific
sustainability benefits. An important contribution to managing
and driving forward our business comes from the sustainability
analysis of our business, which integrates measurable sustainabil-
ity impacts into the strategic management process.

We allocate our resources carefully to drive forward the
development of new and existing products and solutions and for
investments and acquisitions, predominantly in our growth divi-
sions. The divisions focus on different markets, but they have one
thing in common: They are aligned consistently to delivering
innovative solutions for issues and developments of relevance to
industry and end-customers in the coming decades.

1 See section 4. Research and development [} p. 41 ff.
2 Ratio of free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA.

Innovation is an important driver of profitable growth as it lever-
ages the development of new products and applications. Our
focus here is on working intensively with customers and partners
along the value chain. Evonik has defined six innovation growth
fields’ that target highly attractive new markets where we can
effectively deploy our core competencies.

The third element is a performance-oriented culture based on
our corporate values: performance, trust, openness, and speed.
For us, that means initiating change, keeping our promises,
rewarding performance, a readiness to take risks, and being open
to new ideas. We regard ourselves as an international company
and see diversity as an opportunity.

Ambitious targets

Our mid-term financial targets focus on growth, returns, and
cash generation and therefore play a part in increasing the value
of the company. We expect the average volume growth in the
three growth divisions to be more than 3 percent a year. For the
adjusted EBITDA margin, we have set a target range of between
18 percent and 20 percent. The target return on capital employed
(ROCE) is 11 percent, which is well above the cost of capital.
Moreover, Evonik aims to achieve a high cash conversion rate? of
over 40 percent. We aim to pay a reliable and attractive dividend
and uphold our investment grade rating.

3 Number of work-related accidents (excluding traffic accidents) resulting in absences of at least one full shift per 200,000 working hours.
4 Number of incidents in production plants involving the release of substances or energy, fire or explosion per 200,000 working hours.

One reason why the growth divisions significantly exceeded the
target for volume growth was the adverse impact of the corona-
virus pandemic in the previous year. We report on the develop-
ment of these performance indicators in sections 2.4 Business
conditions and performance [) p.21ff. and 2.9 Financial condition
LD p.33¢F.

As a responsible specialty chemicals company, we are also con-
tinuing to pursue our ambitious non-financial targets. We want
to remain below the exacting upper limits we have set for acci-
dent frequency? and incident frequency 4.°

Our target for absolute greenhouse gas emissions® is a
50 percent reduction in absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions’

by 2025. The reference base is 2008—the first full year after the
establishment of Evonik. This affirms our commitment to the
Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In particular, the modern-
ization of our power plants in Marl (Germany) will contribute to
the achievement of this target by significantly reducing CO,
emissions. We set a new energy target in 2020. The aim is to
reduce both absolute and specific’ energy consumption by 5 per-
cent by 2025. This supports the European goal of reducing
energy consumption by 32.5 percent by 2030. We report on the
development of our non-financial targets in section 5.4 Safety
Dy p.54¢. and 5.5 The environment D\ p.ss¢f.

1.3 Business management systems

Most important financial key performance indicators
Financial management of Evonik is based on a consistent system
of value-oriented indicators. These are used to assess the busi-
ness performance of the operational units and the Evonik Group.
Through systematic alignment to these indicators, Evonik
endeavors to create value by raising profitability and ensuring
profitable growth.

We use adjusted EBITDA (i.e., EBITDA after factoring out spe-
cial items) as a financial performance indicator. Adjusted EBITDA
and the corresponding relative indicator, the adjusted EBITDA
margin, show operating performance irrespective of the struc-
ture of the assets and the investment profile. We use this, in par-
ticular, for internal and external comparisons of the cost structure
and profitability of our businesses.

1 Energy consumption per product unit.
2 Ratio of adjusted EBITDA to sales.
3 Ratio of free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA.

The return on capital employed (ROCE) is used as a further
indicator of value-driven management of the company. It is calcu-
lated from adjusted EBIT in relation to average capital employed.
Comparison with the cost of capital, which shows the risk-adjusted
return expectations of our investors, indicates relative value cre-
ation. This is calculated using a weighted average cost of capital,
which reflects the return expectations of both shareholders,
derived from the capital asset pricing model, and providers of
debt capital.

The special items that are factored out when calculating
adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT include restructuring,
impairment losses/reversals of impairment losses, income and
expenses in connection with the purchase/ disposal of invest-
ments in companies, and other income and expense items that,

due to their nature or amount, do not reflect the typical operat-
ing business. We consider that the adjusted earnings figures are
more suitable than unadjusted data for comparing the perfor-
mance of operating units over several periods.

We also use free cash flow as an operational performance
indicator. This is calculated from the cash flow from operating
activities, continuing operations, less outflows for capital expen-
ditures on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment. The
free cash flow shows the remaining scope for financing. It there-
fore shows the company’s internal financing capacity. In view of
the heightened uncertainty about future economic development
prevailing at the start of 2020, we introduced the cash conversion
rate> to enhance the management of our business. This shows
the proportion of adjusted EBITDA that is converted into free
cash flow.

In addition, we forecast and comment on further financial
indicators. These are, in particular, sales and cash outflows for
capital expenditures on intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment, which are important factors influencing the adjusted
EBITDA margin and free cash flow.

Most important non-financial key

performance indicators

Evonik also uses a wide variety of non-financial performance
indicators. Traditionally, we accord special significance to safety,
which is regarded as a holistic management task that has to be
lived at all management levels. Our guiding principles for safety
are binding for all managers and employees. In accordance with
corporate policy, all operating units at Evonik have an occupa-
tional safety target. In addition, all production units have a plant
safety target. The relevant indicators are accident frequency and
incident frequency.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

2.1 Overall assessment of the
economic situation

In 2021, we successfully drove forward Evonik’s strategic devel-
opment. The results of our internal sustainability analysis’ were
integrated into our strategic management process for the first time.
In the coming years, we aim to substantially increase the propor-
tion of growth businesses in our portfolio with a clear focus on
sustainability (Next Generation Solutions). Despite the difficult
conditions, further progress was made with the major investments
at our site in Marl (Germany), for example, the erection of a
large production complex for the specialty polymer polyamide 12
and the construction of two modern gas and steam turbine
power plants. As part of the growth strategy for the Nutrition &
Care division, we acquired Infinitec Activos SL, Montornes del
Valles (Spain), Botanica GmbH, Sins (Switzerland), and JeNaCell
GmbH, Essen (Germany). These were small acquisitions to round
out the portfolio and support the focus on sustainability.2 Fol-
lowing completion of our SG&A optimization program, we con-
tinue to work consistently to achieve leaner structures and
improve the efficiency of production and administration.

Our operating performance was positive in 2021. We registered
high demand worldwide and were able to increase volumes
significantly compared with 2020, which was impacted by the
coronavirus pandemic. Selling prices were also better than in

2020. However, the procurement market became far more volatile
in the second half of the year as a result of the rapid economic
recovery from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. All
primary energy prices increased, and many chemical precursors
were also more expensive. The availability of raw materials,
logistics services, and packaging materials remained very tight.
As a result, Evonik registered higher raw material and logistics
costs, especially in the second half of the year, along with bottle-
necks in global supply chains. Overall, sales and EBITDA increased
significantly, with all chemicals divisions contributing to this. We
delivered on our forecast, which we revised upwards in the wake
of our successful performance in the first half of the year.

Group sales rose 23 percent to €14,955 million. Adjusted
EBITDA improved 25 percent to €2,383 million, driven princi-
pally by higher volumes and improved selling prices. By contrast,
downside effects came from higher raw material and logistics
costs and global supply chain bottlenecks, especially in the sec
ond half of the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to
15.9 percent (2020: 15.6 percent) and therefore remained below
our target mid-term range of between 18 percent and 20 percent.
ROCE improved to 9.0 percent as a result of higher earnings and
was therefore in line with the cost of capital. However, it was
below our mid-term target of 11 percent.

Net income rose 60 percent to €746 million. After adjustment for
special items, net income, continuing operations was 54 percent

Overall assessment of the economic situation

higher at €986 million. At the annual shareholders’ meeting, the
executive board and supervisory board will propose a higher div-
idend of €1.17 per share (2020: €1.15 per share).

We generated a high free cash flow of €950 million. The
cash conversion rate of 40 percent shows the proportion of
adjusted EBITDA that was converted into cash.

Our financial profile is still very good: Evonik has a solid
investment grade rating, and net financial debt is almost
unchanged at a solid level. In addition to adequate liquidity, we
have sufficient unutilized credit lines.

Overall, 2021 was a successful year for the Evonik Group and
Evonik Industries AG.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

2.2 Economic background

Global economic recovery despite continued
turbulence caused by the pandemic

The development of global economic conditions was better
than had been anticipated at the start of the year. IHS Markit?
estimates that the global economy grew by 5.6 percent overall in
2021. At the beginning of the year, growth of 4.4 percent had
been expected.

Rising vaccination rates in most industrialized countries and a
corresponding relaxation of the coronavirus measures strength-
ened global growth in the first half of the year as a result of rising
consumer demand. Global trade in goods picked up strongly, and
global industrial output increased. However, the global economic
rebound lost momentum from mid-year. In many regions, a
renewed rise in Covid-19 infections held back economic activity,
while disruptions to global supply chains and higher raw material,
logistics, and energy costs hampered the upswing in industrial
production. There was a sharp rise in inflation in 2021. Although
the Fed reduced bond purchases from November, monetary policy
in the main industrialized countries remained expansionary. By
contrast, central banks in many emerging markets switched to a
more restrictive policy.

The economy recovered from the previous year’s downturn in all
regions in 2021. In Europe, growth received a boost from rising
consumer demand, industrial output, and exports. The upswing
was supported by economic programs and the European Central
Bank’s expansionary monetary policy. Europe was affected by
the pandemic at the beginning and end of the year. In many
countries, including Germany, measures were introduced to
check the spread of the virus, and these temporarily dampened

consumer demand. Moreover, growth momentum in industrial
production was held back by global supply bottlenecks and rising
production costs.

In North America, especially the USA, the economic upswing
was driven by strong fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, result-
ing in a sharp hike in consumer spending, especially in the first
half of the year. Industrial activity rose particularly strongly in the
second quarter. Covid-19 outbreaks, increasing problems in the
sourcing of industrial precursors, and rising energy prices held
back the economic upswing in the second half of the year.

Asia-Pacific registered strong economic growth but with
regional variances. High growth in China was driven by industry
and exports, while consumer spending remained subdued due to
recurrent pandemicrelated restrictions on mobility. Moreover,

the Chinese economy was held back by energy supply problems
and payment problems by large real estate companies. In Japan,

economic activity was restrained by measures to combat the pan-
demic and high dependence on exports of capital goods, which
suffered from the supply bottlenecks.

The upturn in Central & South America was supported by
favorable external conditions, including export demand from
major trading partners and high commodity prices. In the course
of the year, economic activity was dampened to some extent by
the pandemic. This was compounded by a reduction in agricul-
tural output in Brazil and Argentina as a result of a drought. Con-
sumer spending slowed because rising prices throughout the year
reduced purchasing power.

Recovery in end-customer markets

Industrial activity gained pace in 2021 thanks to rising orders on
hand and high demand. Overall, global industrial output was sig-
nificantly higher than in the previous year. However, growth
momentum was capped at times by pandemicrelated disruption
to supply chains. In some cases, the disruption led to longer sup-
ply times and higher prices for raw materials, precursors, and
transportation services in the industrial sector.

In 2021, Evonik’s end-customer markets recovered from the pre-
vious year’s pandemic-driven downturn. Demand for hygiene
and personal care products rose significantly in 2021, especially
in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. There was a strong
increase in activity in the food and animal feed sector in all
regions except Central & South America. Automotive and
mechanical engineering production also picked up strongly in all
regions, although growth momentum was lowest in Europe.
Demand was robust in the construction sector.

Raw material prices rose across the board in 2021. At the end
of the year, prices were well above the previous year’s low,
pandemicrelated level.

The average annual exchange rate for the euro against Evonik’s
most important currency—the US dollar—increased to USS1.18,
compared with an average exchange rate of USS$1.15 in the
previous year.

2.3 Major events

The coronavirus pandemic continued to affect people's lives and
economic activity around the world in 2021. Evonik took the nec-
essary precautions to protect employees at an early stage to pre-
vent the virus from spreading and keep the business running. We
are continuing to analyze the present situation on a daily basis so
that we can take timely action. In Germany, we have been partic-
ipating in the vaccination drive by company medical officers since
the start of June 2021. The direct impact of the coronavirus pan-
demic on our business performance was negligible in 2021.
However, the procurement market was far more volatile as a
consequence of the rapid global recovery following the pro-
nounced, pandemic-driven deterioration in business conditions in
the previous year. The resulting rise in raw material and logistics
costs and the global supply chain disruption adversely affected
our performance.

2.4 Business conditions and performance

High sales growth

The Evonik Group’s sales increased by 23 percent to €14,955 mil-

All chemicals divisions benefited from higher demand and most
of them reported a significant rise in earnings. The contribution
made by the Technology & Infrastructure division was lower than
in the previous year as a result of higher energy costs, partly due
to power plant shutdowns. The adjusted EBITDA reported by
enabling functions, other activities, including consolidation, con-
tains, among other things, expenses for strategic research and
internal reinsurance. Earnings were reduced by insurance
deductibles at group level for weather-related damage in Europe
and the USA.

The adjustments totaled -€165 million, compared with —€71 mil-
lion in 2020. The restructuring expenses related mainly to the shut-
down of a site operated by the Nutrition & Care division and the

the adjustments mainly comprised expenses in connection with
the acquisition of PeroxyChem and restructuring expenses, espe-
cially for the shutdown of a production plant in the Nutrition &

The financial result improved substantially to -€88 million. It
contained special items of €10 million for interest income in con-
nection with the claim to the value-added tax refund in Brazil. In
the prior-year period, it contained special items of €11 million for
interest in connection with the end of a legal dispute relating to
the sale of a plot of land in a previous period. Thanks to lower
interest expense, the adjusted financial result improved to
-€97 million, despite the expenses for measurement of the
Argentine currency as a hyperinflationary currency. Income
before income taxes, continuing operations, rose by 59 percent
to €1,085 million. The income tax rate on the continuing opera-
tions was 29 percent, and the adjusted income tax rate was
28 percent. That was around the level of the expected group
tax rate. Income after taxes, discontinued operations, amounted
to —€2 million and comprised post-divestment expenses, mainly
for the methacrylates business, which was sold in July 2019.
Net income rose 60 percent to €746 million.

We use adjusted net income to assess the earnings power of the
continuing operations, especially on a long-term view, and to
forecast future development. The calculation starts from EBITDA
after adjustment for special items’. The financial result is then
adjusted for income and expenses in connection with the pur-
chase/disposal of equity investments and other income and
expense items that, by nature or amount, do not form part of
typical current financing activities. Further, we deduct amortization

Cost-saving programs exceeded targets in 2021

The SG&A program, which was launched in 2017 to achieve a
lasting reduction of €200 million in sales and administrative
expenses by 2021, has now been successfully completed. The
overall target of €200 million was exceeded by more than
€30 million. The measures implemented as part of the ongoing

program of continuous improvements to enhance process effi-
ciency, especially in production, once again exceeded the target
with savings of €120 million in 2021.

Efficient and effective procurement

Procurement is organized globally at Evonik and comprises direct
procurement (raw materials, logistics, and packaging) and indi-
rect procurement (goods and services) for strategic activities.
Operational sourcing is also subdivided into direct and indirect
procurement. Reliable supply, gaining access to new procure-
ment markets, and ongoing optimization of the cost of materials
and services are core tasks for our procurement function.

2021 was again marked by a range of production shortfalls
and logistics restrictions. Alongside the ongoing coronavirus
crisis, factors hampering the availability of raw materials included
blizzards in the USA in spring, hurricane Ida in the fall, and the
introduction of the dual-control initiative to reduce energy con-
sumption and improve energy efficiency in China. Prices of raw
materials and packaging increased significantly as higher demand
coincided with restricted market availability. In addition to the
higher demand, raw material shortages in the chemical value
chain were caused by technical problems on the supply side. This
was compounded by a sharp reduction in the availability of
freight space, which resulted in a noticeable shortage of raw
materials in the supply chain and pushed up logistics costs.

In 2021, indirect procurement activities were also geared to
avoiding supply bottlenecks and longer delivery times. By involv-
ing Procurement at an early stage, it was possible to offset most
of these effects. The procurement of work and services and indi-
rect goods was more expensive than in the previous year.

In 2021, Evonik spent around €10 billion on raw materials and
supplies, technical goods, services, energy, and other operating
supplies from about 100 different countries. Europe accounted
for the majority of Evonik’s procurement expenditures (approx.
60 percent), and the Americas and Asia each accounted for
around 20 percent. About 55 percent of procurement expendi-
ture was for raw materials: Evonik purchases fossil raw materials,
especially on the petrochemical market (approx. 20 percent of
total expenditure) and on the synthetic organic market (16 per-
cent). Other important procurement markets for us are inorganic
raw materials (10 percent) and renewables (7 percent).
24

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

Evonik’s supplier base comprises around 35,000 suppliers. The
100 largest suppliers account for around 43 percent of procure-
ment expenditure. About 60 of these top 100 suppliers are in
Europe, 25 are in the Americas, and 15 in Asia.

Return on capital employed higher than in

the previous year

Within our value-oriented management approach, our success is
measured principally by ROCE, which was 9.0 percent in 2021
and therefore exactly in line with our cost of capital, which was
again 9.0 percent before taxes.

The average capital employed increased by €0.2 billion to
€14.8 billion. The main factors in this were capital expenditures
for our operating business and higher net working capital. The
increase in the Evonik Group’s ROCE resulted from the rise in
adjusted EBIT. All of the chemicals divisions improved their
ROCE.

2.5 Comparison of forecast and
actual performance

The forecast we issued at the start of the year was revised
upward in August 2021 as our business performance in the first
half of the year was better than anticipated. Group sales were
above the revised forecast, and the other indicators achieved the
forecast levels.

Group sales rose 23 percent to €15.0 billion in 2021. That was
above the projected range of €13.0 billion to €14.5 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 25 percent to €2,383 million and was
therefore at the upper end of the anticipated range of €2.3 billion
to €2.4 billion. ROCE improved to 9.0 percent, thanks to the
higher earnings. As had been expected since August, it was sig-
nificantly above the prior-year level. Cash outflows for invest-
ments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment were

forecast level of 40 percent.

Turning to our non-financial indicators, accident frequency was
well below the upper limit. We did not achieve the target for
incident frequency in 2021. This was partly due to the introduc-
tion of lower reporting thresholds in 2021.

Strong global demand Considerable improvement in adjusted EBITDA 00 LL  }2)

Despite the global supply chain problems, the Specialty Additives
division reported a very good performance overall thanks to its
business model, which focuses on specific customer solutions to
improve product properties and sustainability profiles. Consider-
ably higher volumes and higher prices increased sales by 15 per-
cent to €3,710 million. The increase in sales was reduced by
slightly negative currency effects.

Demand for products for the construction and coating industries
and for renewable energies increased considerably in all regions,
resulting in a significant rise in sales. Additives for polyurethane
foams for consumer durables such as mattresses and refrigerators
also registered a good volume trend, leading to a significant rise
in sales.

In the second half of the year, sales growth was held back to
some extent by interruptions in global supply chains and the
associated lack of availability of some raw materials.

Adjusted EBITDA rose 7 percent to €920 million in the Specialty
Additives division. The positive volume trend was offset by
higher raw material prices which could not be recouped entirely
through price adjustments in 2021 and therefore put pressure on
the margin. The adjusted EBITDA margin therefore dropped
from 26.6 percent in the previous year to 24.8 percent.

Higher return on capital

Capital expenditures in the Specialty Additives division were
around the prior-year level at €94 million and were therefore
substantially lower than depreciation and amortization, which
amounted to €180 million. The average capital employed
decreased slightly to €4,168 million. ROCE improved to 17.7 per-
cent, mainly due to the increase in adjusted EBIT.

at its sites in Germany, China, and the USA. While the capital
expenditures in Essen (Germany) served to expand production
capacity for specialty silicones and siloxanes, the investments in
Marl, Herne and Essen (Germany) and Wichita (Kansas, USA)
focused on product availability and process safety.

Higher sales

The pleasing business performance in the Nutrition & Care divi-
sion continued, thanks to its focus on high-growth and resilient
end-markets. Sales were 19 percent higher at €3,557 million.
This increase was attributable to considerably higher volumes
and selling prices but was held back by negative currency effects.

Demand for essential amino acids remained strong worldwide.
Together with an improvement in selling prices, this led to sig-
nificantly higher sales. Within the pharmaceutical applications in
the health & care business, lipids for mRNA vaccines posted
particularly high sales growth. This was made possible by the
additional production capacity built up in the first months of the
year. There was a further rise in sales of care solutions products,
especially active ingredients for cosmetic applications.

Significant rise in earnings

Adjusted EBITDA advanced 28 percent to €717 million in the
Nutrition & Care division as a result of increased demand and
higher selling prices. However, the rise in raw material and logistics

costs during the year had a negative effect. The adjusted EBITDA
margin nevertheless improved from 18.7 percent in the previous
year to 20.2 percent.

Higher capital expenditures

Capital expenditures in the Nutrition & Care division increased
by 18 percent to €164 million. As a result, capital expenditures
were below depreciation and amortization, which were
€253 million. The average capital employed was around the
prior-year level at €3,893 million. Thanks to the increase in earn-
ings, ROCE rose to 11.6 percent.

Capital expenditures to support the strategic

focus on sustainability

In the first half of 2021, the health care business built up lipid
production at the site in Hanau (Germany) to deliver this import-
ant basis for mRNA-based vaccines to BioNTech and Pfizer as
part of a strategic partnership. Lipids offer above-average growth
potential in the coming years as further applications alongside
Covid-19 vaccines are expected.

Significant increase in sales

The business trend in the Smart Materials division was very pleas-
ing, especially compared with the previous year, which was
adversely affected by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
Sales were 21 percent higher at €3,918 million. The rise was attrib-
utable to a significant increase in volumes, slightly higher selling
prices, and the initial consolidation of Porocel (from November
2020). Growth was held back by negative currency effects.

Capital expenditures in the Smart Materials division were 19 per-
cent below the high prior-year level at €379 million. As a result
of projects to expand our market positions, they were, however,
substantially higher than depreciation and amortization, which
amounted to €273 million. The average capital employed
increased by 9 percent to €4,637 million, mainly due to the con-
solidation of Porocel, which was acquired in November 2020,
and the capital expenditures. Thanks to the increase in earnings,
ROCE rose to 8.1 percent.

Investment projects to strengthen our market position
Construction of the new production complex for the specialty

plete. We are investing over €500 million in this facility, which
will raise our total production capacity for PA 12 by more than
50 percent. We supply this high-performance polymer world-
wide to strategic growth markets such as 3D printing. As a light-
weight, durable polymer, PA 12 also makes a key contribution to
saving resources in conventional applications such as automotive
engineering. Thanks to its outstanding properties—high stability
combined with flexibility, as well as high temperature resistance
and low weight—this high-performance polymer is used as a
substitute for steel in many demanding applications.

biodiesel and the decarbonization path defined by the US Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA). Along with the anticipated
growth in biodiesel, Evonik expects to strengthen its position by
supplying locally produced high-quality sodium methylate to the
local specialty chemicals and life science markets. A further
alkoxides plant is to be built in Southeast Asia so that the world’s
most important markets can be served regionally. This is planned
as a world-scale facility and is our response to rising demand for
alkoxides in this region.

Investments to reduce CO, emissions

Capital expenditures in the Technology & Infrastructure division
increased by 2 percent to €162 million and were therefore sig-
nificantly higher than depreciation and amortization, which
amounted to €108 million.

trading with external customers at our sites. Adjusted EBITDA
fell 33 percent to €97 million. The main reason for this was an
increase in energy costs, in some cases combined with the tem-
porary shutdown of power plants in Germany.

Technology & Infrastructure is currently erecting two gas and
steam turbine power plants at Marl Chemical Park in Germany.
These are scheduled to come into service in 2022. This will end
Evonik’s generation of electricity and steam from hard coal
worldwide and cut CO, emissions by up to 1 million metric tons
a year. Investment is in the triple-digit million euro range. The
two new plants safeguard cost-effective and future-oriented
energy supply at Evonik’s largest production site, Marl Chemical
Park. In addition to power generation, the generation of steam is
particularly important for production at the chemical park. Flex-
ible load management means the plants will also play a part in
compensating for fluctuations in the amount of energy from
renewable resources fed into the power network. That is a key
building block in the energy transition. The new power plants

will reduce annual direct greenhouse gas emissions from our
facilities worldwide by almost one-fifth, making a major contri-
bution to achieving Evonik’s central climate target of halving
absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. This highly efficient
and flexible co-generation plant for electricity and steam will
have an efficiency of over 90 percent.

2.7 Regional development

A global presence
We generated 83 percent of sales outside Germany in 2021.

Sales in Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) were 25 percent
higher at €7,363 million. In Germany, sales amounted to
€2,469 million, up 19 percent year-on-year. All divisions
reported significant sales growth in the EMEA region. EMEA
accounted for 49 percent of the Evonik Group’s sales. This region
was also the main focus of our capital expenditures, which
remained at a high level of €713 million (2020: €738 million).
The capital expenditures comprised two major projects in Marl
(Germany): the construction of a production complex for the
specialty polymer polyamide 12 and the construction of two gas
and steam turbine power plants.

In North America, sales rose 18 percent to €3,495 million.
Contributory factors were significant growth in the Nutrition &
Care, Specialty Additives, and Smart Materials divisions. This
region accounted for 23 percent of Group sales. Capital expendi-

Sales rose 27 percent to €684 million in Central & South America,
and this region accounted for 5 percent of Group sales. In this
region, strong growth came from the Nutrition & Care division,
but Specialty Additives and Smart Materials also played a part.

Europe, Middle East & Africa

Asia-Pacific

In the Asia-Pacific region, sales climbed 20 percent to €3,413 mil-
lion as a result of higher revenues in all chemicals divisions. This
region accounted for 23 percent of Group sales. Capital expendi-
tures were €65 million, which was below the prior-year level of
€93 million. In China, a new production plant for AEROSIL®
came on stream at the Evonik Wynca joint venture.

2.8 Earnings position

Significantly higher income before income taxes,
continuing operations

Considerably higher volumes and prices increased sales by
23 percent to €15.0 billion. The increase was held back by
slightly negative currency effects. The cost of sales also increased
by 23 percent, driven by the increase in production volumes and
higher raw material prices. The gross profit improved by 21 per-
cent to €4,030 million. Selling expenses were pushed up by a
volume- and price-related rise in freight costs and full-year con-
solidation of the previous year’s acquisitions. Higher personnel
expenses increased research and development expenses. General
administrative expenses were only slightly higher than in the
previous year thanks to the success of our SG&A cost-saving
program. All items were affected by higher performance-
oriented remuneration components, which resulted from the
more favorable business trend, and higher factor costs. The other
operating income declined by 27 percent to €211 million, mainly
because of lower income from the reversal of provisions. Other
operating expenses were slightly lower than in the previous year
at €349 million. Lower expenses for restructuring and additions
to provisions were countered, among other things, by expenses
in connection with legal disputes. Income before financial result
and income taxes increased by 43 percent to €1,173 million.

Substantial rise in net income

There was a clear improvement in the financial result, principally
due to lower interest expense. Income before income taxes, con-
tinuing operations, grew 59 percent to €1,085 million. Analo-
gously to the more positive business performance, income tax
expense increased to €316 million. Income after taxes, discontinued

operations, comprised post-divestment expenses for the meth-
acrylates business. Non-controlling interests in after-tax income
comprised the pro rata profits of fully consolidated subsidiaries
that are attributable to shareholders outside the Evonik Group.
Net income improved substantially to €746 million.

2.9 Financial condition

Central financial management

The principal objectives of financial management are safeguard-
ing the financial independence of the Evonik Group and limiting
financial risks. We therefore apply a central financing strategy.
Borrowing and bond issuance are normally undertaken by Evonik
Industries AG. To reduce external borrowing, surplus liquidity at
Group companies is placed in a cash pool at Group level to cover
financing requirements in other Group companies through intra-
group loans. Currency derivatives are used at Group level to
hedge intragroup loans. Evonik has a flexible range of corporate
financing instruments to meet liquidity requirements for day-to-
day business, investments, and the repayment of financial debt.

Solid investment grade rating

Evonik has a solid investment grade rating. It has a rating of Baa2
from Moody's and BBB+ from Standard & Poor's (S&P)—with a
stable outlook in each case. Maintaining a solid investment grade
rating is a central element in our financing strategy and one of
the Evonik Group’s financial targets. In this way, we gain access
to a broad investor base on appropriate financing terms and thus
maintain our financial flexibility. A solid investment grade rating

gives banks, investors, customers, and suppliers a reliable basis
for a long-term business relationship with Evonik.

Strong free cash flow
The cash flow from operating activities, continuing operations,
increased by €79 million to €1,815 million. The positive effect of
the improvement in the operating result was offset, above all, by
a significant rise in net working capital as a result of the increase
in raw material costs.

The free cash flow improved by €170 million to €950 mil-
lion. This was attributable to the higher cash flow from operating

investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment.
The cash conversion rate’ was 40 percent (2020: 41 percent).

The cash flow from other investing activities resulted in a cash
outflow of €205 million, which mainly comprised cash outflows
in connection with acquisitions and former divestments. The cash
outflow of €856 million for financing activities was principally
due to the payment of the dividend of €536 million for 2020 and
repayment of financial debt.

In August 2021, Evonik Industries AG placed its first green hybrid
bond with a nominal value of €500 million, integrating sustain-
ability even more closely into its financial strategy. The proceeds
from the issue will be used primarily to fund investment in our
Next Generation Solutions’. The hybrid bond issue was placed at
99.375 percent and is subordinate to other financial liabilities.
The coupon is 1.375 percent p.a., and the formal tenor is 60 years.
Evonik has an initial redemption right in 2026.

In August, Evonik Industries AG also made an offer to creditors
to repurchase the €500 million hybrid bond issued in 2017 at
102.091 percent. Just over 80 percent of creditors accepted the
offer, so Evonik redeemed a nominal amount of €402.8 million
in September. The outstanding nominal amount of €97.2 million
was redeemed at a price of 100 percent on October 12, 2021 by
exercising a special termination right set out in the bond terms if
an 80 percent redemption threshold was achieved.

The bonds issued by the financing company Evonik Finance B.V.,
Amsterdam (Netherlands) in 2016 were transferred to Evonik
Industries AG in May 2021. As of the reporting date, bonds with
a nominal value of €2.5 billion had been issued under the debt
issuance program.

around 70 percent of financial liabilities are denominated in

(SGD), and 5 percent in other currencies.

Liquidity position remains strong

As of December 31, 2021, Evonik had cash and cash equivalents
amounting to €456 million and current securities totaling
€446 million. In addition, Evonik has a €1.75 billion revolving
credit facility as a central source of liquidity. This credit line was
agreed in June 2017 and runs until June 2024. It was not utilized
in 2021 and does not contain any covenants requiring Evonik to
meet specific financial ratios. There are also diverse other credit
lines. As of December 31, 2021, €545 million of the total amount
of these had not been drawn.

Financial condition

Solid funding of pension obligations

Pension provisions account for over half of our net debt (sum of
net financial debt and pension provisions). They are non-current
and depend on the discount rate as specified in IAS 19. Compared
with year-end 2020, pension provisions declined by €852 million
to €3,766 million. This was mainly due to the increase in the dis-
count rate. The robust performance of plan assets also had an
impact. The funding of pension obligations’ was 69 percent as of
the reporting date and thus still at a solid level in line with the
industry norm.

Capital expenditures down slightly year-on-year
Investment projects are aimed at utilizing potential for sustained
profitable growth and value creation, as well as maintaining the
value and availability of the existing property, plant and equip-
ment. Evonik is therefore expanding in specialty chemicals busi-
nesses and markets where it already has—or intends to build—a
strong competitive position. Every project is required to undergo
detailed economic and strategic analyses. Evonik expects all proj-
ects to meet a minimum return requirement, which is the cost of
capital. We take a flexible and disciplined approach to extending
our leading market positions. All projects are regularly reviewed
for changes in the market situation.

Capital expenditures? were €929 million, which was slightly
below the prior-year level of €995 million. There is a slight tim-
ing difference in outflows for property, plant and equipment as a
result of payment terms. In the reporting period, outflows for
capital expenditures totaled €865 million (2020: €956 million).

Increase in total assets

As of December 31, 2021, total assets were €1.4 billion higher at
€22.3 billion. Non-current assets increased by €0.3 billion to
€16.2 billion. The increase in goodwill, which was mainly attri-
butable to exchange rates, and the rise in property, plant and
equipment exceeded the decline in deferred taxes resulting from
the remeasurement of pension obligations. In all, non-current
assets made up 73 percent of total assets (2020: 76 percent).

1 See section 2.6 Performance of the divisions ) p. 26 ff.

Current assets increased by €1.1 billion to €6.1 billion. This was
due to higher inventories and to trade accounts receivable, which
also rose in line with the increase in business and higher raw
material prices. Current assets therefore increased slightly to
27 percent of total assets (2020: 24 percent).

Equity increased by €1.3 billion to €9.4 billion. The reasons for
this included positive effects from the remeasurement of defined

benefit pension plans as a result of the increase in the discount

rate for pension provisions and currency translation effects. The
equity ratio increased from 39 percent to 42 percent. Non-
current liabilities decreased by €1.0 billion to €8.9 billion, mainly
due to the reduction in provisions for pensions and other
post-employment benefits. Non-current liabilities decreased
from 48 percent to 40 percent of total equity and liabilities. Cur-
rent liabilities increased by €1.1 billion to €4.0 billion. This was
mainly attributable to higher trade accounts payable as a result of
the increase in raw material costs and the upturn in business.

Earnings position

The earnings performance of Evonik Industries AG is essentially

dependent on income from its subsidiaries, income and expenses

relating to corporate financing, and portfolio management activities.
Financial management is therefore based on an earnings indi-

Sales increased by €52 million to €509 million, driven mainly by
higher volumes and prices in the trade with raw materials and
increased invoicing of IT services. The €13 million rise in the cost
of materials to €56 million was principally due to higher volumes
and prices in the procurement of raw materials. Higher bonus
entitlements contributed to the rise in personnel expense to
€367 million, which was 5 percent more than in the previous year.
Other operating income rose to €500 million, mainly as a result
of currency translation gains. Due to the ban on netting in section
246 paragraph 2 of the German Commercial Code (HGB), cur-
rency translation gains of €454 million (2020: €403 million) are
shown in other operating income, while the corresponding cur-
rency translation losses of €428 million (2020: €411 million) are
shown separately in other operating expense. The net effect was
a gain of €26 million (2020: loss of €8 million).

Income from investments rose by €647 million to€996 million.
The increase resulted from higher income from profit-and-loss
transfer agreements with subsidiaries. Write-downs of €2 million
were made on current securities in the reporting period. Write-ups
of €4 million on financial assets were recognized for shares in
affiliated companies.

The net interest position improved significantly year-on-year
from —€101 million to €15 million. This was principally attribut-
able to income from repayment penalties resulting from early
termination of intragroup loan agreements and higher income in
connection with the measurement of pension assets. Net interest
also contains interest income and expense from the group-wide
cash pool, which is concentrated at Evonik Industries AG.
39

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

Income before income taxes increased to €822 million, princi-
pally as a result of higher income from profit-and-loss transfer
agreements and higher interest income. Income tax expense was
€90 million, compared with €77 million in 2020. The increase in
income tax expense was low compared with the high rise in net
income because in the previous year the tax expense related
entirely to prior periods, and no current taxes were payable. In
2021, the income tax expense was mainly for current taxes.
Moreover, in the calculation of current taxes for 2021, it was
possible to use loss carryforwards of around €100 million for
corporation tax purposes and €84 million for trade tax purposes.

The net income of Evonik Industries AG, calculated on the basis
of the German Commercial Code, was €732 million, an increase
of €772 million year-on-year.

After allocating €21,587,981 to other retained earnings, the
distributable profit is €710,000,000. A proposal will be put to
the annual shareholders’ meeting that €545,220.00 of the dis-
tributable profit should be used to pay a dividend of €1.17 per
share. The remaining €164,780,000 will be carried forward to
fiscal 2022.

Equity increased by €0.2 billion to €6.0 billion, mainly as a result
of the net income. Payment of the dividend in 2021 had a counter-
effect. The equity ratio decreased from 49.2 percent in 2020 to
44.5 percent. The receivables and liabilities reflect the group-
wide financing activities of Evonik Industries AG in its role as the
holding company for the Group. Payables include financial liabil-
ities of €6.6 billion (2020: €5.0 billion). €3.6 billion (2020:

Evonik Industries AG plays a central role in the financial manage-
ment of the Evonik Group’. Borrowing and bond issuance are
normally undertaken by Evonik Industries AG.

In the reporting period, two bonds with a nominal value of
€1.3 billion were transferred from Evonik Finance B.V., Amster-
dam (Netherlands), to Evonik Industries AG, so Evonik Industries
AG is now the sole issuer of all outstanding bonds. Furthermore,
two intragroup loans amounting to €1.0 billion were transferred
from Evonik Finance B.V. to Evonik Industries AG. When the
loans were transferred, Evonik Finance B.V. made an additional

2 For details of the assumptions, see section 7. Expected developments [) p.75 ff.

compensation payment of €0.3 billion to Evonik based on the
market interest rate. These loans were then repaid to Evonik
Industries AG before the due date.

In August 2021, Evonik Industries AG issued its first green
hybrid bond with a nominal value of €500 million. Extensive
information on this and on central financial management can be
found in section 2.9 Financial condition 4} p.33 ff.

As of December 31, 2021, Evonik Industries AG had cash and
cash equivalents amounting to €154 million and current securities
totaling €445 million. In addition, Evonik Industries AG has a
€1.75 billion revolving credit facility as a central source of liquidity."

At Evonik Industries AG, additions to intangible assets
amounted to €10 million in the reporting period (2020: €16 mil-
lion), and additions of property, plant and equipment totaled
€10 million (2020: €18 million). The additions to intangible
assets resulted principally from investment in software.

Opportunities and risks

The most significant operating subsidiaries in Germany have
profit-and-loss transfer agreements with Evonik Industries AG. In
line with the central financing strategy of the Evonik Group, most
internal and external financing transactions are handled by
Evonik Industries AG. Consequently, Evonik Industries AG is

essentially exposed to the same risks and opportunities as
the Evonik Group. Further information can be found in section
6. Opportunity and risk report LY p.64 ff.

Outlook? for 2022

We expect the earnings of Evonik Industries AG to decline
slightly compared with the high level reported for 2021. The
main factor in this decline will be income from investments,
which was influenced by high distributions by subsidiaries in
2021. Further, we assume that income from the measurement of
pension assets will be below the level reported in 2021.

Report on relations with affiliated companies

A report on Evonik Industries AG’s relations with affiliated com-
panies has been prepared in accordance with section 312 of the
German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). It concludes with the fol-
lowing declaration: “Our company received adequate remunera-
tion or compensation for each of the transactions set out in this
report on relations with affiliated companies under the circum-
stances known to us at the time when the transactions were
undertaken. No actions were performed or omitted at the insti-
gation of such companies.”

Our goal: leading in innovation

Linking innovative capability and proximity to customers is a key
success factor for Evonik and a driver of profitable growth. Inno-
vations are the response to needs—of society, people, customers.
Our research and development (R&D) activities comprise the
R&D teams in the divisions, innovation steering, our strategic
research unit Creavis, and Evonik Venture Capital. The strategic
framework for our R&D is defined by the research, development
& innovation council, which is also responsible for allocating
human and financial R&D resources. The council is led by the
executive board member responsible for chemicals and innova-
tion. Other members are the chief innovation officer, the head of
Corporate Strategy, and the heads of the divisions.

Our R&D activities are aligned to six innovation growth fields:

+ Sustainable Nutrition: establishing new products and ser-
vices for sustainable nutrition of livestock and people

+ Healthcare Solutions: developing new materials for implants,
as components of cell culture media, and for custom-tailored,
innovative drug formulations

+ Advanced Food Ingredients: creating a portfolio of health-
enhancing substances and nutritional supplements as a contri-
bution to healthy nutrition

+ Membranes: extending membrane technology for efficient
gas separation to further applications

+ Cosmetic Solutions: developing further products based on
natural sources for cosmetics and sensorially optimized for-
mulations for skincare products

+ Additive Manufacturing: developing products and technolo-
gies for 3D printing

1 With products introduced in or after 2015.

We aim to generate additional sales’ of over €1 billion with these
innovation growth fields by 2025 (reference base: 2015).

In the Sustainable Nutrition innovation growth field, for exam-
ple, AQUAVI® Pro-Pond to improve the quality of water was
added to the system solutions for aquaculture in 2021. This prod-
uct is a probiotic solution that meets the demand for high water
quality in shrimp farming. It was first launched in China.

In the Healthcare Solutions innovation growth field, we pro-
vided innovative solutions that played a part in the breakthrough
of mRNA vaccines in 2021. By supplying basic components for
the COMIRNATY® vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech, Evonik
helped make Covid-19 vaccines available faster in 2021. As part
of a strategic partnership with BioNTech, we produce two differ-
ent lipids for the vaccine. Together with other lipids, they encap-
sulate to form a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which serves as a pro-
tective shell around the mRNA to transport it safely into the cell.
The LNP-based formulations developed by Healthcare Solutions
are a promising technology for selective release of active ingre-
dients in the human body. mRNA technology has considerable
potential for the delivery of other gene-based vaccines.

Medox® and AvailOm®, which are assigned to the Advanced
Food Ingredients innovation growth field, expanded their mar-
ket presence. Both products contribute to healthy and sustainable
nutrition. The high-load omega-3 fatty acid AvailOm® posted
robust double-digit growth. Demand for the latest version of
AvailOm®, which is derived from micro-algae, comes from
customers looking for sustainable solutions. The dietary supple-

ment Medox®, the first Evonik product to be marketed directly
to end-consumers, continued to extend its global reach thanks to
an increased online presence in China. Medox® contains plant
pigments sourced from black berries such as bilberries and black-
currants. It binds free radicals and thus contributes to healthier
blood vessels.

The Membranes innovation growth field expanded its production
portfolio in 2021, strengthening Evonik’s global market position
as a technology leader on the global market for gas separation
membranes. To meet rising demand, we are currently building a
new hollow fiber spinning plant to produce SEPURAN® gas
separation membranes at our site in Schérfling (Austria). The
main growth drivers in the membranes business are the trend to
green gases, including biogas and hydrogen, and demand for
efficient separation solutions, for example, for aviation and the
oil and gas industry.

The Cosmetic Solutions innovation growth field continued its
successful course in 2021. Our corporate venture capital group
invested in the Singapore-based start-up Revivo BioSystems Pte.
Ltd. This company offers a quick and cost-efficient technology
platform to produce realistic 4D models of human skin for the
testing of chemical, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical active ingredi-
ents as an alternative to animal testing.

Evonik is building a new production plant in Marl (Germany) to
strengthen its market position as the leading global producer of
polyamide 12 for powder-based 3D printing. This product was
developed in the Additive Manufacturing innovation growth
43

field. In addition, Evonik entered the market for photopoly-
merization technology with the launch of the first four ready-to-
use INFINAM® formulations within the new Photopolymers
product line. Alliances with major market participants were
expanded to drive forward 3D printing on an industrial scale as a
production technology for the entire value chain.

Successful innovation management

Evonik protects new products and processes through its patent
strategy. The value and quality of our patent portfolio have
increased steadily in recent years. We submitted 280 new patent
applications in 2021, and R&D expenses increased by 7 percent
to €464 million. Our R&D projects are managed using the
multi-step Idea-to-Profit process developed by Evonik to support
the systematic development of projects right up to profitable
commercialization.

Our innovation pipeline comprises completely new business
options as well as activities to secure and enhance the prospects
of existing business operations. Alongside our product and
process innovations, the focus includes business models and sys-
tem innovations. Our project portfolio is aligned to the differing
strategies of the various business lines, and we focus on growth
areas with high sustainability benefits. Through research net-
works, we worked with partners from industry, universities, and
research institutes on more than 50 open innovation projects.
We received funding of more than €5 million for our activities,
for example, from the European Commission and the Federal
Republic of Germany.

MACBETH (Membranes And Catalysts Beyond Economic and
Technology Hurdles), the largest EU-funded project coordinated
by Evonik, reached a milestone in July 2021: The EU Commission
evaluated the project for the first time, and the outcome was
positive. MACBETH aims to develop technologies that make
industrial-scale reactions far more energy-efficient. The EU is
providing funding of €17 million for this project. 24 partners
from ten countries will be working on this in four subprojects up
to 2024. One subproject is taking place at Evonik in the Marl
Chemical Park and focuses on hydroformylation. The aim is to
develop catalytic membrane reactors for industrial use.

Targeted research and development

Our four manufacturing chemical divisions account for around
86 percent of our R&D expenses. Their activities include, first
and foremost, research geared specifically to their core technol-
ogies and markets and the development of new business. An
above-average proportion of our R&D funding is allocated to our
growth divisions, Specialty Additives, Nutrition & Care, and
Smart Materials. The Performance Materials division focuses on
optimizing products and processes.

The strategic innovation unit Creavis works on transformative
innovations that go beyond the product and market focus of the
operational business entities. Its three incubation clusters—
defossilation, life sciences, and solutions beyond chemistry—
should make a key contribution to achieving Evonik’s business
and sustainability targets. For example, the defossilation cluster
is developing high-growth solutions that enable industries to
become less dependent on fossil raw materials or smooth the
way to climate-neutral water management. The life sciences
cluster focuses on novel concepts for sustainable and resource-
efficient production of food and preventing and curing illnesses.
Solutions beyond chemistry is using domain knowledge and
data-based solutions to develop safe, circular, and traceable value

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

Green hydrogen is one of the great hopes for the energy transi-
tion. Firstly, it is a carbon-free source of energy for industry and
mobility, and secondly, it is an important raw material for chem-
ical production. Green hydrogen is produced from water by elec-
trolysis using electricity from renewable resources. At present it
is considerably more expensive than conventional hydrogen,
which is generally produced from methane gas, with carbon
dioxide as a by-product. The key factors for economical produc
tion of green hydrogen, in addition to affordable eco-power, are
the investment costs of the electrolyzer. The central component
of the electrolyzer is an ion exchange membrane, which has a
decisive influence on efficiency and reliability. Evonik has devel-
oped a new type of anion-exchange membrane (AEM), which
should help bring a breakthrough in the cost-effective production
of hydrogen using electrolysis.

In addition, Evonik gains access to potential new sources of busi-
ness through its corporate venture capital activities. We invest
specifically in specialized technology funds and start-ups of stra-
tegic relevance to Evonik. In this way, we gain insights into inno-
vative developments at a very early stage. We work with our

partners on projects to develop new products and technologies
and increase the pace of innovation at Evonik. Around 40 invest-
ments have been made since 2012. One success story is JeNaCell,
a biotech start-up in which Evonik invested in 2015. The
nature-identical material developed by JeNaCell is used in medi-
cal technology and dermatology for the treatment of wounds and
burns as well as in hydroactive skin care. We acquired all shares
in JeNaCell in August 2021.

5.1 Sustainability strategy

Evonik aims to be a best-in-class specialty chemicals company.
Our sustainability strategy defines ambitious goals and manage-
ment tools to support this aspiration and help us translate it into
profitable growth. More and more customers expect us to help
them achieve their sustainability goals. In the future, the ongoing
strategic development of sustainability management at Evonik
will be reflected in the remuneration of the executive board and
corporate executives through additional sustainability targets.

Extensive voluntary commitments and undertakings

Evonik is committed to observing internationally recognized
standards and its own more far-reaching guidelines and principles
of conduct. These include, for example, the ten principles of the
UN Global Compact. We are also involved in many networks
such as Chemie?, the sustainability initiative of the German
chemical industry, and the Word Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD). Together with our code of conduct, our
global social policy, our environment, safety, health, and quality

Sustainability analysis of our business supports
portfolio management

Evonik has integrated sustainability into its strategic management
process. This provides a framework for sustainability management
with a focus on ecological, economic, and social objectives. In the
reporting period, we bundled our contributions to a sustainable
transformation in four Sustainability Focus Areas (SFAs). Each
SFA addresses specific core demands in the sustainability arena:
fight climate change, drive circularity, safeguard ecosystems, and
ensure health & wellbeing. For each SFA, we show how Evonik
reduces its own ecological footprint as well as the handprint
resulting from the use of our products and solutions in the rele-
vant markets. The divisions have different action plans aligned
with the requirements of their specific markets. These take into
account the four Sustainability Focus Areas.

Quantifiable effects are included in our strategic management
process via the sustainability analysis of our business, which cen-
ters on the market signals identified by Evonik as material. These
include, for example, anticipated regulatory trends, environmen-
tal and social performance compared to alternative solutions, and
sustainability ambitions in our markets. All market signals are
based on the World Business Council for Sustainable Develop-
ment’s framework for portfolio sustainability assessments (PSA),
which Evonik was involved in developing from the outset. One
special feature of this approach is the differentiated assessment
of the relevant products in specific product-application-region
combinations (PARCs). For each PARC, we identify the benefits
of using the product and will gradually be quantifying these in
greater detail. The assessment of all the PARCs analyzed is used
in a structured overall evaluation of the sustainability perfor-
mance of our portfolio, resulting in allocation to the performance
categories leader (A++), driver (A+), performer (B), transitioner
(C-), or challenged (C--).

In the reporting period, our sustainability analysis was applied to
our entire portfolio for the second time. We examined
463 PARCs, covering the total sales generated by Evonik with
chemicals in fiscal 2020. The main findings are: Evonik generates
91 percent’ of sales with products and solutions whose sustain-
ability performance is at least in line with the market reference
(leader, driver, or performer category). 37 percent of our sales
come from products and solutions with a clearly positive sustain-
ability profile that is above or even well above the market refer-
ence level (leader and driver categories). We refer to these as
Next Generation Solutions. We aim to substantially increase their
hare of sales by 2030.

Foresighted resource management

Evonik has set ambitious goals for water management and reduc-
ing CO, emissions (scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions)*. Carbon pricing
provides an additional planning parameter for major investments.
As part of the 2021 strategy and planning process, we evaluated
options to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in the short,
mid, and long term.

Continuous improvement of our

sustainability reporting

We continued to drive forward our sustainability reporting in
2021. We are carefully monitoring the developments relating to a
possible EU reporting standard and a new international frame-
work for sustainability reporting. In view of the increasing
importance of non-financial indicators and their steering func-
tion, we launched a sustainability data management project. The
aim is to improve the quality and efficiency of the related data
collection processes and systems. To this end, sustainability data
will be bundled ona single platform (“single point of truth”).

Sustainable finance

As part of the Green Deal, the EU taxonomy is designed to direct
financing towards sustainable investments. In this context, in
2021, the EU Commission adopted delegated acts for the envi-
ronmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate
change adaptation. Evonik’s portfolio of specialty chemicals is
only affected to a small extent by the EU taxonomy at present.

The ongoing development of our portfolio and the sustainability
alignment of our products and processes are becoming increas-
ingly important for the long-term financing of our business activ-
ities. Products and solutions from Evonik play a part in the sus-
tainable transformation of many end-markets. Examples are the
focus on circularity and climate neutrality. The capital markets
recognize our strategic and operational progress towards greater
sustainability. For some years now, Evonik has been established
among the leaders in renowned sustainability ratings and rank-
ings. This excellent position was further strengthened in the
reporting period: The EcoVadis rating agency awarded us a plat-
inum rating for the first time. We also received an AA rating from
MSCI for the first time, positioning us in the leader category. In
August 2021, Evonik successfully placed a green hybrid bond
with a nominal value of €500 million. This was our first green
financing instrument. The development of our Green Finance
Framework ahead of this bond issue played a significant part in
integrating sustainability more closely into our finance strategy.

and commitment are their key attributes and make Evonik strong.
Becoming a best-in-class specialty chemicals company means
paying special attention to all aspects of human resources man-
agement. That includes continuous development as an employer
because we can only achieve our goal with first-class skilled,
motivated, and healthy employees.

Global management

With the aid of the HR strategy process, we ensure continuous
development of our human resources activities in line with our
materiality analysis and corporate strategy. We have revised the
topics addressed by our human resources strategy to reflect the
planned development of our business entities and foreseeable
trends. In the future, we will focus on the following four aspects:
+ Enabling leaders in reshaping the business

+ Engaging people in their career path

+ Ensuring availability of mission-critical talent

+ Offering performance-oriented reward opportunities

Our global HR organization provides efficient digital services
and processes such as myHR and a global knowledge database
for managers and employees to support the objectives of these
focal areas.

5.3.1 Appeal as an employer

We want to offer attractive working conditions in order to gain
and develop the most talented staff for Evonik. As well as cultural
and network initiatives and opportunities for learning and profes-
sional development, we offer our employees performance-
oriented remuneration and additional benefits. We also place
special emphasis on flexible working conditions, work-life bal-
ance, and health-related measures.:

Successful employer branding

As our most important advocates, our employees are the heart of
our global employer branding campaign #HumanChemistry.
They give Evonik a distinctive identity through articles and
personal insights into their working lives on our careers website
and social media channels. We track the development of our
employer brand through external rankings and internal surveys.
Early employee turnover is a key indicator for us’.

Systematic talent management

Attractive career paths, systematic job rotation, high-quality
development programs and, in some cases, hybrid development
programs are essential to develop tomorrow’s top executives. We
regularly assess and evaluate potential, succession scenarios, and
development requirements at HR meetings attended by the exec-
utive board.

Creative onboarding

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we had to come up with inno-
vative virtual solutions to integrate new employees quickly and
reliably into our culture and specialist areas while meeting health
and safety requirements. Virtual welcome events and video blogs
have proven a good way to help people get to know each other
and strengthen networking. Evonik’s global concept for onboard-
ing activities is regarded as best practice in the sector and has
garnered external awards as a result.

Employee survey

Roughly every three years, we ask our approximately 33,000
employees worldwide to give an anonymous assessment of their
working environment. The sixth group-wide employee survey
was held in November 2021, and the participation rate was once
again high at 84 percent. The employee survey gives us an insight
into how organizational changes and the implementation of our
corporate values—performance, openness, trust, and speed—are
perceived throughout the Evonik Group. The commitment index
was 73 percent (for comparison 2018: 68 percent). This index
was derived from six of the 56 survey items. The questions
focused on employees’ general satisfaction with employment at
the company, whether they would recommend the company as
an employer, whether they are proud to work for Evonik, their
support for Evonik’s future direction, motivation, and team spirit.
In the reporting period, we conducted around 50 ad-hoc surveys
and checks on sentiment on a variety of topics. These included
questions about future forms of work.

ONE Culture

Our success is built on diversity and a common understanding
of the binding elements of the Evonik Group: our purpose, our
values, and the working principles derived from them. The ONE
Culture initiative strengthens these elements in our daily work.
Key success factors are employee engagement, group-wide shar-
ing of ideas, and cross-functional collaboration. In the reporting
period, these requirements were integrated into many formats,
such as the Evonik competency model, onboarding workshops,
and learning journeys.

An extensive performance management system

Our performance management process is based on eight perfor-
mance dimensions. As well as performance and leadership
behavior, these include the achievement of goals and the quality
and quantity of work. The behavior with which results are
achieved is also taken into account. Compared with the previous
year, greater emphasis was given to three aspects—diversity, sus-

tainability, and leadership behavior. These are incorporated into
Evonik’s competency model, which describes the abilities our
executives bring with them and are expected to develop in their
teams. We are convinced that sustainable business activities and
the diversity of our teams are the basis for performance excellence.

Long-term jobs

Our aim is to offer our employees an attractive contractual status
to provide security for their long-term planning. Therefore, about
96 percent of our employees worldwide have permanent con-
tracts. We work with staffing agencies in Germany to cover
short-term or temporary bottlenecks. All agencies must provide
evidence of a valid operating permit. Since the chemical industry
requires a large number of highly qualified employees, fewer
agency staff are used than in other sectors of manufacturing
industry. Agency staff only accounted for a low proportion of
Evonik’s total workforce as of December 31, 2021.

Awards in 2021

For the fourth time in succession, our company received the
“Leading Employer” award in Germany and was ranked as the best
employer in the chemical sector. In the cross-sector ranking, Evonik
ranked tenth, positioning it among the top 10 of the most attrac-
tive companies in Germany. Evonik was once again listed among
the most popular employers in China (Top Employer Institute).

Global remuneration policies
Fair, market- and performance-oriented remuneration is
anchored in our human resources tools worldwide. The princi-
ples we use to structure remuneration, including fringe benefits,
are set out in group-wide policies. Remuneration is set on the
basis of criteria such as responsibility, competencies, and success.
In addition, minimum standards defined by law and in collective
agreements, e.g., local minimum wages, are applied. Personal
attributes such as gender, age, etc., play no part in the process.
Collective agreements on remuneration cover almost
100 percent of our employees in Germany and around 71 percent
of our employees worldwide. Almost all of our sites and compa-
nies have performance- or profit-oriented incentive systems.
These systems cover nearly all of our permanent employees.
Evonik offers voluntary social benefits to employees in all regions
where it has a presence. Evonik does not restrict employees’
rights to freedom of association or the right to collective bargain-
ing. These rights are also ensured in countries where freedom of
association is not protected by the state.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

In addition, in 2021, we once again offered employees in Germany,
the USA, Belgium, and Singapore the opportunity to take part in
the “Share” employee share program. The participation rate
remained high at 42 percent.

Work-life balance
Evonik places value on an HR policy that is family-friendly and
geared to different phases in people’s lives. More than 95 percent
of our employees around the world have access to related initia-
tives. At the heart of this approach are flexible worktime models,
support for people caring for close relatives, and assistance with
childcare. The PAIRfect initiative offers a job-sharing platform to
help employees structure their worktime more flexibly by bring-
ing them together with colleagues who want to share a job.
Evonik is perceived by the general public as a family-friendly
employer. We have been audited annually since 2009 by the
Hertie Foundation for the berufundfamilie certificate. In 2021,
the women’s magazine BRIGITTE once again singled out Evonik
as one of the best companies for women.

#SmartWork project

SmartWork refers to a hybrid approach that aims for a balanced
mixture of presence in the workplace and mobile working. It is
using findings from the coronavirus pandemic and completed
pilot projects to improve and institutionalize virtual, flexible col-
laboration at Evonik. In 2021, we started to drive forward the
lasting implementation of new ways of working. The goal is
intelligent linking of remote and mobile working. This will also
bring cost savings by reducing the need for office space and busi-
ness trips, which should help improve Evonik’s ecological foot-
print in the future.

5.3.2 Diversity and equal opportunity

As an international company, we see diversity as an opportunity.
In our view, diversity is not simply a social or political obligation.
We see it as a key to the success of our business.

Diversity enriches

Evonik does business in many markets worldwide. Diversity is
therefore normal in our business activities. Employees with dif-
ferent backgrounds and personalities enrich our teams and our
company. Diversity enhances Evonik’s creativity, innovative capa-
bility, and proximity to customers. Therefore, we raise employ-
ees’ awareness of the importance of diversity in our daily work
through our corporate media and regular campaigns.

Our diversity strategy is derived from our corporate strategy.
Diversity is a firm element in our corporate values, working prin-
ciples, and, since 2020, the Evonik competency model. The
Parameters we use to manage diversity often exceed the legal
requirements. We inform all employees about the present
situation in an annual diversity report, and the executive board
receives quarterly information on the development of important
diversity indicators. Our diversity council ensures that diversity is
a success factor that is deeply embedded in our organization and
drives it forward through cross-business criteria. It comprises the
members of the executive board, the heads of the divisions, and
representatives of the regions and corporate functions. All mea-
sures to ensure diversity take a holistic approach: We address the
issue from strategic, cultural, and process perspectives. By strate-
gic, we mean our executives systematically set an example in
diversity and manage it through indicators in the dimensions
experience, age, training, nationality, and gender. We also take

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Sustainability
Employees

©8690090

into account different mentalities and perspectives arising, for
example, from religious conviction and sexual orientation. We
integrate diversity into our HR processes and measure its day-to-
day implementation in the Evonik Group.

Our code of conduct and global social policy forbid discrimi-
nation on the basis of origin, race, religion, age, gender, sexual
orientation, and disability. Employees who feel they have been
discriminated against have a right to lodge a complaint anony-
mously via our whistleblower system, which can be accessed
both internally and externally.

Age structure

We foster cross-generational collaboration in our teams and place
special importance on maintaining mental and physical health.
Examples are the Fit for Life program and support for employees
who care for relatives. Other offerings include LILY (Learning
and Individualized Library) for lifelong learning. Moreover,
reverse monitoring offers different generations an opportunity to
learn from one another and actively advance diversity at Evonik.

In 2021, the average age of Evonik employees was around
43 years. 46 percent of new hires were under 30, 47 percent
were aged 30 to 50, and 7 percent were over 50.

Higher percentage of women

Increasing the proportion of women in our company worldwide
and at all levels is one of Evonik’s declared objectives. Our aim is
for women to account for 23 percent of executives at each of the
top two management levels and 30 percent of other managers by
2023. We take equality of opportunity very seriously in the
recruitment of new employees. As a guide, we use the propor-
tion of women studying the disciplines that are relevant for us.
Our objective is for women to make up around 40 percent of
new management employees. At present, 26 percent of our
employees are female. The proportion of female managers was
28 percent in 2021.

employees combine working and family life, such as childcare,
vacation programs for kids, and a regular get-together for parents.
We also offer our employees networks such as GroW, an internal
network for female employees, and our job-sharing platform.

As a global company, it is particularly important to us to ensure
that our workforce includes a broad spectrum of different nation-
alities. Evonik currently employs people of 106 different nation-
alities at 208 sites in more than 53 countries. The proportion of
managerial employees who do not hold German citizenship is
around 45 percent. Group-wide, the proportion in middle man-
agement is around 25 percent.

#TogetherAsOneEvonik stands for Evonik’s commitment to fair-
ness and diversity and the rejection of hatred and discrimination.
Our business council in North America has set up a task force to
develop short- and long-term measures. These range from support
groups for members of social minorities in the workforce, through
diversification of procurement, to organizing a diversity BarCamp.

5.3.3 Training and continuing

professional development
Well-trained employees are a key success factor in competition.
Our learning strategy and personnel development programs
focus on future business needs.

Learning strategy for continuing professional
development

Our training and continuing professional development activities
comprise further training of our employees and vocational train-
ing of young people. Evonik has a global learning strategy devel-
oped together with our employees. Considerable progress with
this was made in 2021. The central elements are uniform and
consistent global solutions for advanced training and personal
development with digital self-learning content, simplification of
the offering of digital learning platforms, and increasing the
acceptance of self-directed digital learning and lifelong learning.

The learning and individualized library tool (LILY) gives our
employees access to a wide range of learning journeys and digital
content for self-directed learning. The global development portal

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Sustainability
Employees

©8690090

provides a transparent overview of our continuing professional
development offerings and our learning and development strat-
egy. Both platforms are available to all employees worldwide,
providing they have the necessary IT infrastructure and access to
the intranet. Our FutureZone learning platform administers the
participation of employees in mandatory training and e-learning
sessions and notifies them of the need to complete them.

Training ratio remains high

The alignment of our vocational training strategy to ensure the
recruitment and development of young people in line with our
needs, which started in 2016, has now been completed. With
around 1,100 apprentices, we consider that we are well-prepared
for the challenges of demographic change and the associated
reduction in the availability of qualified employees for production
and related areas. To retain young people in the company, since
2019 all apprentices who are able and willing to take up employ-
ment have been offered jobs. The number of additional appren-
tices being trained in cooperation with other companies remained
constant at around 430.

In 2021, Evonik trained more than 1,600 young people, including
more than 430 for other companies. Our offering covered more
than 24 recognized vocational training courses and combined
vocational training and study programs at 16 sites. Apprentices
accounted for 5.8 percent of our workforce in Germany, which is
still well above the national average of around 5 percent in the
both the chemical sector and industry. In all, we invested around
€62 million in vocational training of employees. Our high com-
mitment to vocational training is also reflected in the high pass
rate in examinations.

The Start in den Beruf pre-apprenticeship program has
proven very effective preparation for youngsters who are not yet
ready for a vocational training course. In the 2020/2021 project
year, we offered an additional 16 places on this program, bringing
the total to 66. A further increase to 80 places is planned for the
53

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

2021/2022 project year. This complementary offering enables
the young people to gain an insight into the dual training system
and the occupations available to help them make a career choice.
This has been particularly important during the pandemic as it is
not possible to organize internships for school students.

Despite the ongoing pandemicrelated restrictions, Evonik feels
that all apprentices received a good training in 2021 and were
prepared for their examinations. The provision of tablet comput-
ers, the progressive digitalization of learning scenarios in a spe-
cial multimedia learning environment, and time spent working
from home proved a good combination. From the start of the
new training year, regular introductory events at our vocational
raining centers and external centers were held, taking the
pandemic related precautions into account.

n 2021, Evonik invested around €338 per employee in training
and continuing professional development. That was a total of
around €11 million. Due to the pandemic, it was still not possible
o run most face-to-face training sessions in 2021. Compared to
he previous year, the CPD market increased online training, live
virtual training sessions, and digital self-learning. We adapted our
CPD offering accordingly and noticed a slight rise in learning time.

5.3.4 Health protection and promotion

Global management of health protection and promotion at
Evonik takes a long-term, holistic approach, covering employees,
the working situation, and the general working environment.

Occupational health protection was again confronted with special

challenges in 2021 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Pan-
demic plans were in place at all sites worldwide. The steering

bodies were active at group, regional, and site level. The Evonik
steering committee issued binding global instructions for the
Group. Based on these, local committees defined measures
aligned to their situation. In Germany, the works agreement on
Covid-19 concluded with representatives of the workforce was
adapted many times, and new aspects were added.

Through the defined measures, combined with systematic and
extensive case and quarantine management, we were largely able
to avoid infection chains and clusters at our sites. Differentiated
reporting and regular conferences calls ensured good communi-
cation between the various steering levels. A hotline was set up for
employees. In addition, extensive information on the pandemic
was provided in the intranet, along with support offers. We used
our #TogetherAgainstCorona and #MaskUpAndCarryOn cam-
paigns to appeal to our employees to continue to act responsibly
to protect themselves and others.

Healthy employees are our goal

Our approach to health protection and promotion includes
high-quality medical care as required, applying ergonomic and
health-related measures to structure working conditions and a
functioning emergency management system at plant level. We
therefore comply with all statutory occupational medicine and
health protection requirements. In addition, we offer a range of
voluntary measures to foster the health of our employees. These
are bundled in the group-wide well@work initiative. In this way,
we help our employees adopt a healthy lifestyle.

The main goals and aspects of our occupational health strategy
are outlined in the Evonik Global Health Program. On this basis,
we systematically refine our strategy and adapt it to the latest

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

developments. Based on occupational health and safety require-
ments in Germany, we have set out policies for our global work-
force. The occupational safety committees at our sites in Ger-
many meet at least four times a year, as required by law. There
are also comparable bodies at other sites. Fulfillment of the rele-
vant requirements is monitored through internal and external
environment, safety, and health audits, and an extensive occupa-
tional health and safety reporting system. Action is taken if there
are indications that there is scope for improvement or deviations
from the applicable guidelines. Where necessary, improvements
are suggested or required.

Achieving our health protection goals is measured by our
Occupational Health Performance Index, which comprises
parameters from the areas of occupational medicine, health pro-
motion, and emergency medical management. In 2016, we
defined a long-term target of 2 5.0’. According to the reports
submitted by our organizational units, we achieved this.

As part of its preventive health promotion activities, Evonik uses
suitable measures to prevent occupational illnesses and work-
related health impairments. In this context, Evonik regularly
reports on occupational illnesses.

Corporate health promotion

Our well@work program focuses on three aspects: exercise, a
healthy diet, and work-life balance. Mental fitness was added as
a new aspect in 2021. Corporate health promotion has a firm
place in these activities. Evonik uses basic programs with a long-
term focus to encourage employees to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
At all of our German sites, there are interdisciplinary health task
forces to implement well@work.

5.4 Safety

Safety as a management task

Protecting the health and employability of our employees and
preventing accidents and incidents at work, in the operation of
our production facilities, during transportation, and on the way to
and from work are of central importance to Evonik. To meet its
management responsibility in occupational and plant safety,
Evonik has globally valid policies, processes, and systems, which
are firmly anchored in our integrated management system.
Implementation of the applicable regulations is monitored using
centrally planned audits, which are performed in close consulta-
tion with our divisions and external certification bodies. Steering
bodies at group level ensure that mission-critical processes are
standardized across the divisions. Requirements and the need for
action are defined in binding targets based on performance indi-
cators. The frequency and severity of accidents are also reflected

in the variable remuneration of members of the executive board.

Our Safety at Evonik safety culture initiative has been developed
into a group-wide management approach for all aspects of occu-
pational and transportation safety. It defines binding principles of
action that give our managers and employees and personnel from
staffing agencies reliable guidance on safety-compliant conduct
in their daily work.

European Chemical Industry Council.

Evonik employees, including employees from staffing agencies.
In total, Evonik employees worked approximately 65 million hours in the reporting period.

NaAUuUARWNA>

To ensure that our safety management measures are directly
comparable with common international practice, in the reporting
period, we altered the indicator for reporting workplace accidents
from 1 million working hours to 200,000 working hours. Since
2021, plant safety has been evaluated using lower thresholds’.
Incidents at our production facilities are now also reported on the
basis of 200,000 working hours, compared with 1 million work-
ing hours in the past. That is in line with the present Cefic? defi-
nition. The more detailed recording and evaluation of incidents
permits a deeper understanding of the scope for improvement.

Our crisis and incident management focus on preventing and lim-
iting damage if accidents nevertheless happen. We analyze inci-
dents systematically so we can learn from them and further
improve our safety performance. We share the findings within the
company via suitable media. To build and share experience, we
also participate in various national and international networks.

Accident frequency well below the upper limit

We pay special attention to occupational safety. The safety of our
employees covers safety on the way to and from work as well as
safety at work. Contractors’ employees working at our sites are
also included. Accident frequency? is the performance indicator
for occupational safety at Evonik.

In 2021, the accident frequency rate for Evonik employees* was
within our defined maximum limit of 0.26. This indicator remained
at a low level of 0.195, helped by the fact that many employees
were working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The new volume thresholds are 1/10/100 kg depending on the hazard class, compared with the conventional reporting thresholds of 5/100/2,000 kg.

ees in 2021. Moreover, there were no serious accidents involving
our employees or contractors’ employees.

Incident frequency above the upper limit

Safety is part of our DNA: It is the basic precondition for the
operation and performance of our facilities. Plant safety is the
basis for reliable, effective, and future-oriented production. We
set demanding safety standards for the entire life cycle of our
plants worldwide. We regard safety as an all-round task, which is
established worldwide through our safety management systems
and regularly reviewed. Incident frequency’ is used to measure

Our incident frequency rate was 0.48 in the reporting period, so
we failed to meet our target of remaining below the upper limit
of 0.40. This was due to the lower threshold for recording inci-
dents, which is reflected in an increased number of incidents.

We work steadily to optimize our safety management system. In
2021, we realigned our expert circle on plant safety to consoli-
date the responsibilities of the various bodies and reduce internal
interfaces. The global structure of the expert circle, which
includes representatives of our divisions and regions, ensures a
holistic perspective on plant safety issues. The expert circle com-
pleted its first projects in the reporting period, including leading
indicators for plant safety performance. We also analyzed expe-
rience from process safety studies in recent years. This was used
to improve the relevant group-wide standards.

5.5 The environment

Protecting our environment and the climate are major global
challenges of our time. Maintaining the natural basis of life for
future generations is part of our corporate responsibility. That
includes continuously reducing emissions in keeping with our
sustainability strategy. As a specialty chemicals company, we are
aware that our production impacts the environment. We take
many steps to minimize this.

Worldwide management

Our actions are based on an extensive, integrated management
system for the environment, safety, health, and quality. This
applies to the whole of the Evonik Group and is based on legal
requirements, internal policies, and standard operating proce-
dures. In addition to meeting compliance requirements, we
therefore support the continuous improvement of our environ-
mental performance. Furthermore, we require our manufacturing
sites to be validated as conforming to ISO 14001, the internation-
ally recognized environmental management standard. In the
energy sector, we use ISO 50001 and are working to implement
it digitally. The proportion of output covered by validation varies
because of the addition of new units. However, it is always
between 95 and 100 percent.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Sustainability
The environment

©8690090

Implementation of our strategy and management system is mon-
itored via a central audit system. Based on the findings and ana-
lyses of internal and external audits and site inspections, talks are
held on possible improvements and ways of implementing them.
The executive board is informed annually of the outcome of the
audits. The processes used to collect and process environmental
data are subject to internal and external audits. Our high quality
standards are backed up by regular training. Data input is decen-
tralized, and the data can be evaluated on the basis of manage-
ment units, legal structures, or regions. Our global ESHQ
(environment, safety, health, and quality) strategy is defined by
the HR Executive Committee.

5.5.1 Climate change

According to our materiality analysis, climate change is one of the
most important sustainability issues. As well as producing prod-
ucts that are sustainable and enhance efficiency for our custom-
ers, we are reducing our CO, emissions by modernizing and
renewing our energy infrastructure and taking steps to increase
energy efficiency. Carbon pricing is used as an additional criterion
for major investments.

Responsibility at the highest level

Climate change is a matter of the utmost importance for the
entire executive board. Direct responsibility for our group-wide
sustainability and climate strategy, monitoring, and reporting
is assigned to the member of the executive board responsible for
human resources, sustainability, and ESHQ. The head of the
ESHQ function reports regularly to the executive board on
climate-related issues. These include environmental indicators,
including climate-related performance indicators, as well as tar-
gets and target attainment. In addition, the responsible member
of the executive board and the heads of the ESHQ and Sustain-
ability functions are members of the HR Executive Committee,
56

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

which also takes decisions on climate-related issues. The other
members of this committee are representatives of the divisions
and regions and technical experts. The executive board discusses
relevant issues relating to sustainability, the environment, safety,
health, and quality, as well as the status and progress of the
various programs with the heads of the divisions and corporate
functions on a quarterly basis.

New environmental targets for climate protection

Our target is to cut scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions" by
50 percent in absolute terms by 2025. The reference base is
2008—the first full year after the establishment of Evonik. This
affirms our commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate
Change. At present, we assume an average reduction in climate-
relevant emissions of 3 percent a year. Furthermore, by 2025 we
want to reduce scope 3 emissions from our upstream value
chain—basically our “raw material backpack”—by 15 percent
compared with 2020. We also aim to cut absolute and specific
energy consumption by 5 percent. Contributions will come,
among other things, from innovative technologies, optimization
of production, efficient utilization of non-renewable energy
sources, and the use of renewable energy. Another keystone is
extending integrated structures between chemical production
and energy facilities, including increased integration of third-
party production facilities and local authority customers.

Evonik constantly examines the use of renewable energy. For
example, our site in Rheinfelden (Germany) sources almost half
of its power supply from environmentally friendly hydroelectric
facilities. In addition, we use hydroelectric power generation in
WeiBenstein (Austria) and solar power in Hanau (Germany),
Mexico City, and Querétaro (both Mexico). We are also increas-
ing the use of renewable energy sources indirectly by stepping
up the purchase of green electricity certificates.

A new gas and steam turbine co-generation plant at Evonik’s site
in Marl (Germany) will end more than 80 years of electricity and
steam generation from hard coal at this location and reduce car-
bon emissions by up to 1 million metric tons a year. Group-wide,
that will reduce direct annual scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions
by almost one-fifth. The highly efficient co-generation plant for
electricity and steam is scheduled to come into service 2022. The
power plant will be highly flexible, so it can play a part in com-
pensating for fluctuations in the amount of energy from renew-
able resources fed into the power network, which is a key build-
ing block in Germany’s energy transition.

In addition, we are currently building a further gas and steam
turbine power plant in Marl to replace the present gas-fired
reserve plant. In 2022, this second power plant will complete the
renewal of the energy infrastructure at this site, which is Evonik’s
largest site worldwide. The new plants will have total efficiency
of over 90 percent and rated power of 270 Megawatts of elec
tricity. That is equivalent to the electricity required by about
750,000 homes. The plants will be able to generate up to 660
metric tons of steam an hour. All power plants at Marl Chemical
Park will be operated from a new control center.

Many of our energy management systems meet the high stan-
dards of ISO 50001. In the future, we aim to optimize energy
consumption in the Evonik Group by using a digital energy man-
agement system. The higher transparency and improved control
increase efficiency and therefore reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions. We plan to include further sites worldwide by 2026 to
cover over 90 percent of our energy consumption and energy
costs. The main aim is to use this new system to cut energy costs
while meeting our energy target.

Volume-driven increase in net energy input

Absolute net energy inputs increased by around 6 percent to
67.64 petajoules in 2021, mainly due to higher production vol-
umes. Specific net energy input nevertheless decreased slightly,
by 1 percent. This was due to numerous individual measures to
improve energy efficiency. At present, natural gas and coal are
Evonik’s main fuels. When the new gas and steam turbine power
plants are taken into service in Marl (Germany), Evonik will no
longer have any coal-fired electricity generation anywhere in the
world. In addition to natural gas-fired generation of electricity
and steam for captive use, large amounts of process heat from
exothermic reactions, for example, from the production of acro-
lein, are used in integrated heating systems.

Greenhouse gas emissions on track

The standard used to report our greenhouse gas emissions is the
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Standard. We distinguish
between direct scope 1 emissions from energy generation and
production and indirect scope 2 emissions from the purchase of
electricity and steam. External power inputs are reported using

1 Scope 1 comprises direct energy and process emissions, and scope 2 comprises emissions from purchased electricity and heat. Scope 3 contains indirect emissions such as emissions from the production of purchased raw materials.

the location-based and market-based methods. In accordance
with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, in the location-based method,
carbon dioxide emissions from purchased power are calculated
using country-specific average emission factors, while in the
market-based method, the individual emission factors of the
power supplier are used.

Absolute net GHG emissions increased slightly in the reporting
period, by 1 percent to 5.5 million metric tons CO,eq'. Combined
with a 7 percent rise in production volume—mainly due to the
strong recovery of the global economy in the reporting period
and the acquisition of the Porocel Group—this led to a consider-
able drop of 6 percent in specific net GHG emissions?. Within
scope 1, that was mainly due to increased gas-fired energy gen-
eration in Marl (Germany) and specific energy-saving measures.
Another reason—within scope 2—is the increased external
sourcing of power from renewables. Consequently, although
power purchased from third parties increased by 14 percent in
2021, the related GHG emissions decreased by 15 percent.

In the reporting period, Evonik had 23 facilities (2020: 24) that
fall within the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU
ETS). The facility in Taavetti (Finland) no longer falls within the
scope of the EU ETS due to the restructuring there. In total,
Evonik emitted 3.3 million metric tons CO, in the reporting
period (2020: 3.2 million metric tons CO).

In addition, we are directly affected by carbon pricing systems in
a number of countries. In Germany, we are subject to the national
emissions trading system as well as the EU ETS. In the provinces
of Fujian and Shanghai in China, our Nanping and Shanghai sites
are subject to the regional emissions trading systems. National
emissions trading systems apply for our sites in Morrinsville
(New Zealand) and Ulsan (South Korea). Our sites in Gibbons
and Maitland (Canada) and Singapore are subject to the relevant
national CO, taxes. Overall, about 63 percent of Evonik’s gross
scope 1 and 2 emissions are subject to carbon pricing systems.

Carbon pricing factored into investment calculations

Evonik uses internal carbon pricing for major investments as a
basis for effective management of its CO reduction target. This
adds another relevant indicator to the established planning
parameters for investments such as exchange rates and raw mate-
rial prices. The aim is to be able to reflect the development of
carbon-intensive investments in a reliable and harmonized man-
ner in all investment applications worldwide. At present, we
assume that the carbon pricing for the EU ETS will be €95 per
metric ton CO, up to 2030. In all other regions of relevance to
Evonik, we are retaining our forecast of €50 per metric ton CO,
by 2030 at the latest. In view of regional differences in the start-
ing situation, we have developed scenarios for the development
of carbon pricing—differentiated by countries and regions—
showing the rise to the assumed final price. In these, we take into

account both direct CO, emissions (scope 1 emissions) from pro-
duction and energy generation and indirect CO, emissions from
the purchase of secondary fuels (scope 2 emissions).

Information based on TCFD

We are following the objectives of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the ongoing develop-
ment of established reporting standards closely. In keeping with its
participation in CDP Climate Change, in 2021 Evonik again pub-
lished detailed strategies, data, and development paths on climate
change Ql https: //www.evonik.com/CDP-ClimateChange. A cross-unit
working group regularly examines the TCFD requirements. We
present key climate-related information in a TCFD index? using
the TCFD structure, divided into the categories governance,
strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.

Other emissions into the air

Alongside emissions of greenhouse gases as reported above,
energy generation and industrial production result in further
emissions into the air. We want to reduce these further and
therefore take the emissions situation into account when plan-
ning new facilities. Our clean air measures include returning
exhaust gases to the production process and thermal processing
of residual gases with a high calorific value (as substitutes for
natural gas). We also use other methods to reduce emissions
from production facilities. Examples are wet and dry scrubbing,
condensation, adsorption, and thermal and catalytic incineration.
Some of these emissions treatment facilities are used simultane-
ously by several units. Our environmental management systems
set the framework for us to achieve the statutory thresholds.

5.5.2 Disclosures on the EU taxonomy

EU taxonomy—little focus on specialty chemicals

at present

As part of the Green Deal, the EU taxonomy is designed to direct
financing towards sustainable investments. The EU taxonomy has
six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate
change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and
marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution pre-
vention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiver-
sity and ecosystems. In 2021, the EU Commission adopted dele-
gated acts for the first two environmental objectives. Their main
focus is on economic activities that currently result in high carbon
dioxide emissions, where a reduction in emissions would make
the biggest contribution to achieving the EU’s climate targets.
The chemical products mainly affected by the delegated acts for
these two environmental objectives are commodity chemicals. At
present, only a few categories of precursors are affected.

Evonik’s portfolio of specialty chemicals is therefore only
affected to a small extent by the EU taxonomy at present. In
other words, only a few of our activities are taxonomy-eligible’.
In 2021, taxonomy-eligible activities only accounted for 16 per-
cent of turnover, 21 percent of CapEx?, and 13 percent of OpEx?.

Taxonomy-eligible economic activities are activities within the scope of the EU taxonomy that are listed in Annexes | and II of the delegated
regulation supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 for the first two environmental objectives. The second set of FAQs published by

For fiscal 2022, Evonik will be reporting for the first time on its
taxonomy alignment? for the climate change mitigation and
climate change adaptation objectives. We anticipate that only a
very small proportion of the eligible activities will be taxonomy-
aligned. This is because, in the case of chemical products, the
first two environmental objectives in the EU taxonomy mainly
address the carbon footprint of production but ignore the posi-
tive effects (handprint4) arising from the use of many products.
By contrast, the sustainability analysis> of our business covers the
footprint, handprint, and further signals and market require-
ments. Many Evonik products are differentiated from competitive
products principally through their handprint. Our sustainability
analysis, with its holistic approach, therefore remains the key tool
for the strategic management and ongoing development of our
portfolio.

Assessment of the taxonomy eligibility of activities

To determine which activities are taxonomy-eligible for the first
two environmental objectives—climate change mitigation and
climate change adaptation—we focused very closely on the pro-
visions of the delegated acts. In this analysis, we were supported
by intensive discussions with experts from our operating units.
The result is that only a few of our products are relevant for the

first two objectives. These are hydrogen, basic chemicals such as
butadiene, and products assigned to the category plastics in pri-
mary form. In addition, we have identified some precursors ® for
energy efficiency equipment for buildings as taxonomy-eligible.
Some of the Technology & Infrastructure” division's activities
with external customers can be assigned to the categories oper-
ation of electricity distribution and transmission systems and
freight rail transport and operation of rail networks. All products
and activities affected are at levels well below our reporting seg-
ments, which are our divisions. Therefore, both the identification
process and collection of the data had to be performed manually
at product level.

Determination of the key performance indicators

For 2021, the EU taxonomy only requires disclosure of the share
of turnover, CapEx, and OpEx attributable to taxonomy-eligible
activities. The shares attributable to taxonomy-aligned activities
of relevance for the first two environmental objectives have to be
disclosed from the 2022 reporting period. The main prerequisites
for taxonomy alignment are that the taxonomy-eligible activities
meet demanding technical screening criteria and minimum social
safeguards as well as the requirement that they do no significant
harm to the other environmental objectives.

5 See section 5.1 Sustainability strategy D) p.46f.
6 In the delegated acts for the environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, the economic activity

the EU Commission on February 2, 2022 are not addressed in this year’s reporting because it was not possible to implement them in accor-

dance with Evonik Industries AG’s data quality standards in the short time available before the deadline for preparation of the report.

In particular, when assessing the taxonomy eligibility of economic activities, we did not draw a distinction between those that are “eligible,”

“eligible-to-be-enabling,” and “eligible-to-be-transitional,” and we did not apply the technical screening criteria. Furthermore, for the

environmental objective “climate change adaptation,” we did not perform a vulnerability and risk assessment or establish a specific plan to

implement further adaptation solutions.

As defined by the EU taxonomy, see [} p.59 T35 and T36.

Taxonomy-aligned activities are taxonomy-eligible activities that meet the stringent technical screening criteria set out in the delegated

acts on the EU taxonomy and meet minimum social safeguards.

“manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings” comprises both products and their core components. Evonik products that are
precursors for such equipment and influence their energy efficiency. They have therefore been included here as taxonomy-eligible core
components. This economic activity is defined more rigidly for the climate change mitigation objective than for the climate change adaptation
objective. However, since Evonik reports the taxonomy eligibility for both environmental objectives together, the higher taxonomy-eligible
criteria for the climate change mitigation objective are used as a conservative approach.

The Technology & Infrastructure division focuses on the provision of internal services. By contrast, the share of taxonomy-eligible activities
is based on external sales. Reportable taxonomy-eligible turnover in this division only comprises the operation of railroads, freight rail
transport, and infrastructure operation. Other taxonomy-eligible activities generate almost exclusively internal sales; their aggregate external
sales are less than €25 million, corresponding to 0.2 percent of the Evonik Group’s sales. We have therefore disregarded these activities
on materiality grounds.

At the level of the taxonomy-eligible economic activities, direct
assignment to the KPls was only possible on a restricted basis. In
these cases, we used appropriate coding to the next highest level
where an indicator was available. The next highest level is either
a product line or a business line; both of these levels are below
the level of our IFRS reporting segments, which are our divi-
sions. All indicators were assigned to at most one taxonomy-
eligible activity to avoid possible double counting of turnover,
CapEx, and OpEx.

Evonik does not currently have any major investment plans
(CapEx plans) for taxonomy-eligible activities, which would
transform a non-taxonomy-aligned activity into a taxonomy-
aligned activity within the next five years and for which CapEx or
OpEx as defined in the EU taxonomy was incurred in 2021.

5.5.3 Water management

We save water wherever possible and endeavor to achieve a
further reduction in our emissions into water. A good water sup-
ply is crucial for smooth production.

Efficient use of water

The Evonik Group strives to use water as efficiently as possible.
The availability of water as a resource depends enormously on
regional and local conditions. By using water stress analyses at
production sites, we aim to pay greater attention, in particular, to
the considerable local differences in the availability of water. For
us, water stress refers first and foremost to the availability of
water for production. Our sustainable water management also
takes into account quantitative, qualitative, and social aspects
of water use. We identify the potential for improvement at our
sites and endeavor to minimize the use of water, especially in
water stress areas, in order to respect the needs of our neighbors.
We plan to develop a new quantitative water target through a
strategic project in 2022.

Taking into account projections for climate change and socio-
economic developments, in 2019 we identified sites that are par-
ticularly likely to be affected by water stress in the next 20 years.
These findings were revised and updated in 2020. Our definition
of water stress is based on the AWARE method’ recommended
by the EU Commission. In our examination of the relevant sites,
we use the AWARE categories: extreme—high—medium—mod-
erate. In the reporting period, ten production sites were classified
as being exposed to extreme or high water stress using the
AWARE system, and a further nine were classified as having
medium or moderate exposure.

1 AWARE stands for Available WAter REmaining.
2 See the declaration on corporate governance in the compliance section [) p.87f.

We are therefore initially focusing our effort to achieve our pres-
ent water target on our major integrated production sites and
sites in regions exposed to water stress. In the reporting period,
we conducted further interviews and analyses of measures at all
sites with a water stress classification of high or extreme. Our
ESHQ experts and the process and technology experts responsi-
ble for the relevant sites were involved in this. At the sites con-
cerned in China, India, the USA, South Korea, and Europe, we
also held detailed local discussions on water use and possible
options to reduce this. For 2023, we are planning a systematic
analysis of all sites with a classification of moderate or low. Based
on these activities, site-specific action plans have been drawn up
to ensure effective preventive measures. We have introduced
suitable management processes to monitor the achievement of
our global water target.

5.6 Value chain

We drive forward our sustainability activities along the value
chain. In addition to our own production and business processes,
we always have an eye on the supply chain for our raw materials,
goods, and services and on product benefits and applications for
customers.

5.6.1 Preventing bribery and corruption

We are convinced that reliable and ethical management of the
company is the basis for our long-term business success, fair
competition, and acceptance by society. We are committed to fair
competition for the benefit of our stakeholders, comply with cartel

and antitrust law, and forbid any form of corruption by our
employees. Business ethics and corruption prevention are based
on our code of conduct and our code of conduct for suppliers.
These are supplemented by our policy on gifts and hospitality,
and group-wide standards on the use of external third parties for
distribution and when dealing with authorities (policy on exter-
nal intermediaries). We conduct regular risk analyses on fighting
corruption, antitrust law, and anti-money laundering.

Our code of conduct is binding for all Evonik employees world-
wide, including the executive board and the governance bodies
of all Evonik companies. They are required to comply with the
rules set forth in the code of conduct, ensure they are familiar
with its content, and take part in the relevant training. Violation
of the code of conduct can damage Evonik’s reputation and result
in substantial financial loss. We therefore have a zero tolerance
approach. Violation of the code of conduct can have far-reaching
consequences for the employee involved.

Our code of conduct for suppliers sets out binding requirements
for our suppliers. Intermediaries, above all sales intermediaries,
are subject to corruption screening and further compliance
checks before the establishment of the business relationship and
have to sign a corresponding declaration. Risk-based compliance
checks are also applied to business partners involved in acquisi-
tions, joint ventures, corporate venture projects, and major
investment projects. These are based on uniform rules for the
Evonik Group.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

5.6.2 Supply chain

Careful supplier selection

Evonik has a significant influence on society and the environment
through its procurement volume. We are aware of this responsi-
bility. Together with our suppliers, we drive forward transpar-
ency and sustainability along the value chain.

By selecting suppliers carefully, we do not simply secure and
increase their sustainability standards, we also enhance the qual-
ity of the entire value chain. Our focus is on validating and eval-
uating suppliers. Suppliers of certain critical raw materials are
subject to a special examination. We define critical raw materials
as all raw materials that could potentially involve a supply risk or
reputational risk, such as conflict minerals’ and renewable raw
materials, including palm oil. We have established special pro-
curement strategies for these critical raw materials. These pro-
cesses are integrated into a management system, where they are
mapped. As well as monitoring suppliers of critical raw materials,
we aim to examine the sustainability of all major raw material
suppliers? by 2025.

Continuous dialogue with our suppliers is very important for us.
In addition to direct contact to Evonik’s procurement organiza-
tion, employees at supplier companies always have the option
of reporting any issues or problems to our externally operated
whistleblower hotline. All cases are examined promptly so that
appropriate action can be taken. In 2021, we did not receive any
reports of issues relating to our suppliers.

The aim of our procurement organization is to guarantee long-
term reliability of supply for the production of Evonik products

and to secure competitive advantages for our operating busi-
nesses. Alongside economic requirements, our procurement
strategy takes account of criteria such as health, quality, safety,
social factors, and environmental protection. As a member of the
UN Global Compact, we are committed to its principles. These
requirements are documented in our code of conduct for suppli-
ers, which is based on our corporate values, the principles of the
UN Global Compact, the International Labor Standards issued by
the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the topics
addressed by the Responsible Care® initiative.

Suppliers are validated and evaluated

We expect our suppliers to share our principles and to act correctly
in all respects, which means accepting responsibility towards
their employees, business partners, society, and the environment.
The validation and evaluation of our suppliers are an integral part
of sustainable supply chain management at Evonik. The valida-
tion of new suppliers includes checking that they meet the
requirements of our code of conduct for suppliers. Alongside
quality, environmental protection, safety, health, and energy
management, the assessment of potential risk factors includes
corruption prevention, cybersecurity, labor and social standards
(the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining),
human rights (compulsory, forced, or child labor), conflict min-
erals, and responsibility within the supply chain. In our evaluation
of suppliers, special attention is paid to our strategic suppliers
and suppliers of strategic raw materials. Strategic suppliers and
raw materials are defined as those identified with the operational
units as being of high significance for our business performance.
These may be key raw materials or single-source situations. We
work systematically both to extend strategic relationships with

suppliers and to validate new suppliers. To supplement our code
of conduct for suppliers, our approach includes self-assessments,
audits, and validation of suppliers through the Together for Sus-
tainability (TfS) initiative.

Harmonizing global standards in the supply chain creates trans-
parency and makes it easier for both suppliers and customers to
reliably assess and evaluate sustainability performance. The
chemical industry set up the TfS initiative for this purpose in
2011. Evonik is one of the six founding members. The aim of TfS
is the joint development and implementation of a global assess-
ment and audit program for responsible procurement of goods
and services. It also provides webinars and training on sustain-
ability. In this way, TfS does not simply make environmental and
social standards in supply chains measurable; it also helps to
bring about a direct improvement.

Active involvement in TfS is important to us. As a member of
the TS initiative, we are also subject to TfS assessments. At the
start of 2021, EcoVadis awarded us platinum status for the first
time, based on the assessment initiated in 2020. That places
Evonik among the top 1 percent of the companies evaluated by
EcoVadis in both the chemical industry and other sectors. In pre-
vious years, EcoVadis awarded our specialty chemicals company
a gold rating on six occasions.

We achieved our target of conducting a sustainability assessment
of 90 percent of suppliers of critical raw materials in 2019. We
have therefore extended our target and now aim to evaluate the
sustainability of all major raw material suppliers by 2025. Around
69 percent of major raw material suppliers had been reviewed
using sustainability criteria by year-end 2021.

As a responsible company, Evonik aspires to meet its duty of care
with regard to conflict minerals in the supply chain and checks
the origin of such substances delivered by its suppliers. Our
screening in 2021 did not identify any use of conflict minerals.

Evonik is actively working to implement the requirements of the
German legislation on due diligence in the supply chain. Based
on the well-established supplier validation, supplier evaluation,
and risk identification processes, our supply chains are under-
going a far-reaching review to analyze, avoid, and where necessary,
eliminate specific risks relating to human rights. More detailed
processes and responsibilities will be established in 2022.

5.6.3 Product stewardship

Product stewardship is a vital precondition for our business. It is
our “license to operate.” It includes timely identification, evalua-
tion, and minimization of the potential health and environmental
risks in our portfolio.

1 REACH = Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals.

We examine the entire value chain of each of our products—
from the procurement of the raw materials to the delivery to our
industrial customers. This is a product stewardship approach and
should not be confused with a complete life cycle assessment.
We make all legally required information on safe handling of our
products available to our customers, together with further infor-
mation, for example, on disposal of the products. That includes
safety data sheets and technical information sheets. As well as
complying with all statutory requirements such as the European
chemicals regulation REACH" and the Globally Harmonized
System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), prod-
uct stewardship at Evonik includes voluntary commitments that
go beyond these regulations. We have been committed for many
years to the international Responsible Care® initiative and the
Responsible Care® Global Charter of the International Council
of Chemical Associations, which includes the Global Product
Strategy. The key elements of our product stewardship have
been defined in a product policy. To supplement this, an operat-
ing procedure defines how these commitments are to be imple-
mented within Evonik, together with control mechanisms to
monitor their observance.

The European Green Deal published by the EU Commission sets
out a timetable for Europe to become climate-neutral by 2050.
One element in the zero-pollution target is the chemicals strategy
for sustainability published by the EU in October 2020, which
will have far-reaching consequences for the chemical industry
and its value chain. It includes, among other things, amending
and tightening the REACH regulation, the classification and
labeling regulation, and many other regulations. The chemicals

regulations are expected to have a far stronger focus on dangers.
Evonik supports the aims of the Green Deal but sees a consider-
able need to optimize the chemicals strategy.

We evaluate all substances placed on the market (> 1 metric ton
p.a.). Particularly dangerous substances are included from lower
amounts. That allows a soundly based assessment of the risks.
Where necessary, restrictions are placed on certain usage pat-
terns or, in extreme cases, a complete ban is issued on use in
certain products. We use the Chemicals Management System
developed by Evonik to evaluate our substances. This system
supports us in global product evaluation, analogously to a life
cycle analysis. As an extension of this, our Chemicals Manage-
ment SystemPLUS is used for products containing substances of
very high concern. These are subject to a more detailed examina-
tion to bring about a further reduction in the negative impact on
people and the environment.

5.6.4 Business ethics and human rights

As well as complying with the law and respecting human rights,
the principles of business ethics involve respecting internal regu-
lations and binding voluntary commitments. We are committed
to fair competition, we comply with cartel and antitrust law, and
we forbid any form of corruption by our employees. Respecting
human rights is a central element in corporate responsibility. We
address the associated obligations throughout the company and
along the value chain, within our sphere of influence.

Evonik has various tools, principles of conduct, and guidelines to
ensure we observe our human rights obligations. The fundamental
importance of human rights for Evonik is reflected in the execu-
63

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

tive board’s policy statement on human rights, which is based on
the Universal Bill of Human Rights, the International Labor Stan-
dards issued by the International Labour Organization (ILO), and
the OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Human
rights are part of our code of conduct and also form the basis for
our global social policy. The human rights demands made on our
suppliers are set out in a separate code of conduct. We regularly
check compliance through our supplier validation and evaluation
processes. Our risk map shows potential human rights and labor
law risks at country level. It is continuously updated. This internal
tool gives us insights into our sites, major supplier countries, and
possible human rights risks. The sources used for the map
include the Global Rights Index of the International Trade Union
Confederation (ITUC), the Global Slavery Index of the Walk Free
Foundation, and the Global Childhood Report published by Save
the Children. We also use MVO Netherlands’ CRS Risk Check.
We use the human rights risk map to define and implement mea-
sures to raise awareness.

Violations of human rights can be reported to Evonik via internal
reporting channels and a whistleblower hotline operated by an
external provider. This enables employees and external parties
(e.g., suppliers, customers, other business partners, and victims)
to report suspected breaches of human rights. The anonymity of
whistleblowers is protected if they do not wish to disclose their
identity. All allegations are investigated internally. In 2021, we
received two reports of human rights violations, but ultimately
they were not confirmed.

In view of the increasing importance of human rights in global
supply chains, it is important to us to regularly raise the aware-
ness of employees and business partners and sharpen their com-
pliance with human rights. Based on the findings of our risk map,
we have developed human rights training activities, which we
have extended in recent years. They are used worldwide via
internal communication platforms and e-learning modules. Train-
ing was conducted first in countries where the potential human
rights risk is highest. Participants come from both administrative
and operational functions.

The National Action Plan (NAP) on the economy and human
rights adopted by the German government in 2016 ended with
the monitoring phase in 2020. In light of the findings of the NAP
monitoring, legislation on due diligence in supply chains was
passed by both houses of the German parliament in summer
2021. The new law comes into force on January 1, 2023.

5.6.5 Social commitment

We produce where our markets and customers are. Conse-
quently, we have production facilities in 27 countries on six con-
tinents. Local residents around our sites play an especially
important part in stakeholder management at Evonik. At all our
sites, they have an elementary interest in experiencing Evonik as
a reliable partner and want timely information on the latest
developments in the Evonik Group. We maintain contact with
them, for example, through invitations to visit our sites, personal
discussions, and written communication. The most important

issues for local residents include the safety of our production
sites, questions on current business development and operational
changes, our appeal as an employer, and our local activities.

Our commitment comprises donations and sponsorship activities,
with a special focus on our corporate purpose: Leading beyond
chemistry to improve life, today and tomorrow. We only sponsor
projects and initiatives that fit our core brand and have a social
component. In addition, our aim is to foster the positive develop-
ment of society at our sites. Our operating units support their
own projects tailored to their business and local communities—
within our strategic guidelines, which are set out in our policies
on donations and sponsorship. Overall, we concentrate our social
commitment on the areas of education and science, social proj-
ects, culture, and sports.

The Evonik Foundation has a special place in Evonik’s social com-
mitment. Its motto is supporting people because it is people who
shape the future. The Evonik Foundation pursues its goals
through its own programs and projects and by making donations
to support projects by other organizations. The foundation’s mis-
sion defines young people, science, and integration as its key
areas of focus. The Evonik Foundation’s support centers primarily
on the regions close to Evonik’s German sites.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

6.1 Opportunity and risk management

Risk strategy

Evonik’s group-wide internal opportunity and risk management
(referred to generically as risk management in this section) forms
a central element in the management of the company. In compli-
ance with the requirements of section 91 paragraph 2 of the Ger-
man Stock Corporation Act (AktG), Evonik has established a risk
detection system as part of its risk management. The most recent
revision took place in 2021: The risk landscape was extended to
include extreme risks, and a risk-bearing capacity was defined.
The aims are to identify risks as early as possible and to define
measures to mitigate them. To ensure optimal use is made of
opportunities, these also need to be recognized and tracked from
an early stage. We only enter into entrepreneurial risks if we are
convinced that, in this way, we can generate a sustained rise in
the value of the company and, at the same time, permanently
limit possible negative implications.

Structure of risk management

Structure and organization of risk management

At Group level, risk management is assigned to the chief financial
officer and is organized on a decentralized basis in line with
Evonik’s organizational structure. The divisions and functions
bear prime responsibility for risk management. That comprises
early identification of risks and estimating their implications. Fur-
thermore, suitable preventive and control measures have to be
introduced and internal communication of risks must be ensured.
Risk coordinators in the organizational units are responsible for
agreeing on the relevant risk management activities and ensure
the reporting line to the corporate risk officer. At all levels in the
Group, systematic and timely risk reporting is a key element in
strategic and operational planning, the preparation of investment
decisions, projections, and other management and decision-
making processes.

A central corporate risk officer coordinates and oversees the
processes and systems. The corporate risk officer is the contact
for all risk coordinators and is responsible for information, docu-
mentation, and coordination at Group level. Further responsibil-

ities include the ongoing development of the methodology used
by the risk management system. The risk committee is chaired by
the chief financial officer and composed of representatives of the
functions. It validates the group-wide risk situation and verifies
that it is adequately reflected in financial reporting. The super-
visory board, especially the audit committee, oversees the risk
management system.

In 2021, risk management again included all consolidated compa-
nies in the Evonik Group. At companies where we do not exert a
controlling influence, we implement our risk management
requirements primarily through our presence in management and
supervisory bodies. Material opportunities and risks are inte-
grated into our risk management via our matrix organization.

The Group Audit function monitors risk management in our
organizational units to make sure they comply with statutory and
internal requirements and to ensure the continuous improve-
ment of risk management. The risk detection system is included
in the annual audit in compliance with the requirements for listed
companies.

The risk management system is based on the internationally
recognized COSO Enterprise Management standard. It is imple-
mented through a binding group-wide policy. Individual risks are
systematically identified and managed with the aid of special risk
management software. Their probability of occurrence and the
possible damage (potential impact) are evaluated and docu-
mented, together with their expected value (product of probabil-
ity of occurrence and potential impact). Analogously to current
planning, the evaluation is based on a period of three years (mid-
term planning). Opportunities and risks are defined as positive
and negative deviations from the plan. The relevant indicators
include adjusted EBITDA. In addition, longer-term opportunities
and risks, including those relating to sustainability, are included.

The opportunities and risks are assigned to categories in a uni-
form risk catalog. Climate-related opportunities and risks are
integrated into appropriate established categories.

The organizational units conduct an extensive annual risk
inventory in connection with the mid-term planning process.
They are required to provide details of the measures to be taken
with regard to the risks identified, introduce them immediately,
and track their timely implementation. Internal management
(for example, reporting by the risk committee) takes a mid-term
view. The opportunities and risks identified are classified as low,
moderate, or high (see c29). The evaluation is always based ona
net view, in other words, taking into account risk limitation
measures. Risk limitation measures can reduce, transfer or avoid
gross risks. Common measures include economic mitigation
measures, insurance, and the establishment of provisions on the
balance sheet.

In the context of the risk inventory, the risk exposure
(expected aggregate value of all risks) is compared with the
risk-bearing capacity. The risk-bearing capacity is calculated using
a combination of an equity-based and a liquidity-based approach.
The risk-bearing capacity is intact.

The risk inventory is supplemented by regular quarterly reviews
of all opportunities and risks relating to the present year, both to
spot changes in the opportunities and risks that have already
been identified and to identify new risks and opportunities.

All high and moderate risks and opportunities with an expected
value of over €100 million in the mid term are classified as mate-
rial individual risks and opportunities. The expected value is used
exclusively as a basis for prioritization and to focus reporting on
key issues.

6.2 Overall assessment of opportunities
and risks

Given the measures planned and implemented, as of the report-
ing date, no risks have been identified that—either individually or
in conjunction with other risks—could jeopardize the continued
existence of Evonik as a whole, including Evonik Industries AG in
its role as the holding company for the Evonik Group.

For 2021, we expected more risks than opportunities. Since
the situation remains very volatile due to the coronavirus pan-
demic, both opportunities and risks are around the same level as

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report

in the previous year. In all the chemical divisions, more opportu-
nities than risks materialized overall in 2021. Our reporting distin-
guishes between the categories markets and competition, legal
and compliance, and process and organization. The main param-
eters influencing the risk categories in terms of both opportunities
and risks that materialized resulted from the development of spe-
cific market- and competitive situations. From the present stand-
point, as in previous years, the risks for 2022 outweigh the poten-
tial opportunities. Compared with 2021, the opportunities for the
Evonik Group are slightly higher, and the risks are slightly lower.
The material risks for the Evonik Group are the threat of
cyberattacks, changes in the exchange rates of the main curren-
cies of relevance for Evonik, and lower margins for C, chemicals.
The material opportunities for the Evonik Group are changes in
exchange rates, the development of the price of methionine and
higher margins for C, chemicals. Compared with the previous
year, the last two exceeded the materiality threshold. Measures
to reduce the risks include general economic mitigation mea-
sures, strengthening our IT security, and, especially with regard
to changes in exchange rates, the use of hedging instruments.
Subsections 6.3 LY p.o7¢t., 6.4 DY p.724, and 6.5 [) p.74 present the
material risks and material opportunities, along with further
opportunities and risks in each of the main categories (see C30).
Except where otherwise indicated, they apply to all divisions.

6.3 Markets and competition
opportunities and risks

n accordance with our internal management, opportunities
and risks in the markets and competition category are allocated
o risk quantification classes within sub-categories. The following
chart (c31) shows the highest class to which an individual risk or
opportunity is allocated in each sub-category. Individual oppor-
unities and risks may also be allocated to the lower risk classes.
Where two sub-categories have the same profile in the chart,
hey are ranked first on the basis of the opportunities, then listed
in descending order, based on their expected impact.

1. Financial markets

As a rule, liquidity, currency, interest rate and credit default risks,
and the risks relating to pension obligations are managed
centrally. All material financial risk positions are identified and
evaluated in accordance with group-wide policies and principles.
This forms the basis for selective hedging to limit risks. In the use
of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to mini-
mize the risks, Evonik applies the principle of separation of front
office, risk controlling, and back office functions and takes as
its guide the banking-specific minimum requirements for risk
management (MaRisk) and the requirements of the German
legislation on corporate control and transparency (KonTraG).
Financial derivatives’ are only used in connection with corre-
sponding hedged items.

Liquidity risks

To manage the Group’s solvency, Evonik uses central liquidity
risk management. At its heart is a group-wide cash pool. In
addition, Evonik’s financial independence is secured through a
broadly diversified financing structure, a €1.75 billion revolving
credit facility as a central source of liquidity, and our solid invest-
ment grade rating. Overall, we believe that adequate financing
instruments are available to ensure sufficient liquidity at all times.

Exchange rate volatility

Transaction-related exchange rate risks arise from the translation
of operating monetary assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
into the functional currency of the respective Group company.
The resulting net risk is normally hedged in full using derivatives.
Furthermore, our transaction-related currency management takes
account of forecast cash inflows and outflows, which are hedged

on the basis of forecast transactions, with a target hedging rate of
up to 75 percent. Material opportunities and risks may arise from
the remaining unhedged items and from discrepancies between
the actual forward rates and the average rates used to hedge
forecast transactions. Scenario analyses are performed to esti-
mate, and control such risks and opportunities. The focus lies on
the main foreign currencies of relevance for the Evonik Group,
the US dollar, the Chinese renminbi yuan, and the Singapore dollar.
In view of the rising importance of regions outside the euro
zone, risks and opportunities relating to transactions in foreign
currencies will increase in the long term. In addition, there are
currency-related risks from the translation of separate financial
statements. Increasing volatility of exchange rates can be seen, in
particular, in emerging markets, for instance, in Argentina, which
is a hyperinflationary economy. Economic risks also arise because
exchange rates influence our competitiveness in global markets.

68

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

Changes in interest rates

Potential changes in capital market rates on the financial markets
result in opportunities and risks. These comprise, on the one
hand, changes in the fair value of fixed-interest financial instru-
ments and, on the other, changes in interest payments on variable-
rate financial instruments. To control these risks, when setting
interest rate terms, Evonik pays special attention to the structure
of the fixed-floating rate mix and uses interest rate swaps for
further optimization where appropriate. Through the use of
fixed-interest loans and interest rate hedging instruments,
99 percent of all financial liabilities were classified as fixed-
interest as of the reporting date and therefore had no material
exposure to changes in interest rates.

Default risks
Default risks involve the risk of a loss if our debtors are fully or
partially unable to meet their payment commitments. The credit
risk of our customers and financial counterparties is therefore
systematically examined when the contracts are concluded and
monitored continuously afterwards. Limits are set for each con-
tractual partner on the basis of internal or rating-based credit-
worthiness analyses.

Financial opportunities and risks in connection

with pension obligations

Both opportunities and risks may arise from potential changes in
the parameters used to evaluate our pension obligations’.
Changes, especially in interest rates but also in mortality rates
and rates of salary increases, can alter the present value of pen-
sion obligations, which directly alters equity and can result in
changes in the expenses for pension plans.

1 See note 6.10 to the consolidated financial statements [) p.132 ff.

Market opportunities and risks, and liquidity and default risks
relating to financial instruments, also arise from the management
of our pension plan assets. We counter these risks through an
active risk management approach, combined with detailed risk
controlling. Strategic management of the portfolios takes place
via regular asset-liability studies. To minimize risk, we use deriv-
ative hedging strategies where appropriate. The broad diversifi-
cation of asset classes, portfolio sizes, and asset managers avoids
cluster risks, but there are unavoidable residual risks in the indi-
vidual investments.

Impairment risk

The risk of asset impairment arises when the interest rate used in
an impairment test rises, the forecast cash flows decline, or
investment projects are halted. Specific risks may arise in connec-
tion with goodwill or individual assets.

2. Sales markets

The global macroeconomic development entails both opportuni-
ties and risks for Evonik. These opportunities and risks will be
driven, in particular, by the development of the coronavirus pan-
demic. A successful end to the pandemic could bring opportuni-
ties through strong industrial growth and pent-up demand. Con-
versely, setbacks in combating the pandemic or the appearance
of new virus variants entail a risk of supply chain disruption and
rising insolvencies. Other relevant parameters affecting the mac-
roeconomic development, apart from geopolitical conflicts and
trade disputes, are the general economic trend in major econo-
mies and their monetary and fiscal policies. The current high
inflation rates and developments in key sectors of the economy
could affect demand in the market areas of relevance for Evonik.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Markets and competition opportunities and risks

©8690090

Global economic trends influence the development of Evonik’s
earnings and cash flows. We counter these economic risks by
constantly monitoring the macroeconomic environment, optimiz-
ing cost structures and competitive positions in our established
areas of business, setting up production facilities close to our
markets, and extending businesses in our portfolio that have low
cyclical exposure.

Alongside the general demand situation, intensive competi-
tion in the various market segments entails both opportunities
and risks. These may result from either demand in specific mar-
kets or the competitive situation in various industries. Changes in
demand can have a considerable impact on our business volume
and sales. In our market segments, climate change could also
result in both opportunities and risks for Evonik. There could be
a significant rise in the growing demand from our customers for
resource-saving products, resulting in a correspondingly positive
impact on our business. Additional regulations or weather-
related incidents could put pressure on our production costs and,
at the same time, lead to rising demand for our resource-efficient
products. To reduce the risks, we monitor the specific develop-
ments very carefully and work closely with our customers on the
development of sustainable solutions.

Competitors in emerging markets and developing countries,
especially China, can increase competitive pressure through new
capacities and aggressive pricing policies that can adversely affect
our selling prices and volume trends. To counter this, we are
broadening our foreign production base and gaining access to
new markets in high-growth regions such as Asia and South
America. To reduce these risks, the operating units affected also
use various methods of increasing customer loyalty and gaining
69

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

new customers, enter into strategic research alliances with cus-
tomers, and extend the services offered along the value chain.

We are constantly developing attractive and competitive new
products and technologies to mitigate the risk that chemical
products could be replaced by new, improved, or less expensive
materials or technologies. One potential risk factor for our amino
acids business, for example, in Asia, is the possible impact of sub-
standard food quality and food safety. We utilize opportunities
for profitable future growth by gaining access to new markets as
part of our strategic development.

Customer concentration is basically low in our chemicals
business. None of the end-customer markets /industries that we
serve accounts for more than 20 percent of sales. Nevertheless,
some operational units, especially in the Smart Materials division
and the services business in the Technology & Infrastructure divi-
sion, have a certain dependence on key customers. Dependence
may arise, in particular with regard to production facilities
erected in the direct vicinity of major customers. The possible
loss of a major customer could result in lower sales and impair-
ment losses.

3. Raw material markets

For our business operations, we require both high-volume raw
materials and smaller amounts of strategically relevant raw mate-
rials that have to meet highly demanding specifications. In both
cases, Evonik is confronted with opportunities and risks relating
to the increasing volatility of the availability of raw materials and
their prices.

The operating business is dependent on the price of strategic
raw materials, especially petrochemical feedstocks obtained
directly or indirectly from crude oil. The price of renewable raw
materials such as lauric oils is highly volatile and is driven, for
example, by weather-dependent harvest yields and, in the case of
inorganic materials, the political framework. Changes in exchange

rates are another significant aspect affecting price risks. These
risks are hedged by optimizing the global focus of procurement
activities, for example, by accessing new markets and concluding
market-based contracts. To further reduce the price risks with
regard to products that have intensive raw material requirements,
our aim is to pass both the risks and the opportunities of fluctua-
tions in raw material prices along to other stages in the value
chain, where possible, for example through price escalation
clauses.

The overriding aim of our procurement strategy is to ensure
the availability of raw materials on the best possible terms. Short-
and mid-term bottlenecks in the availability of precursors and
intermediates are potential risks. To anticipate bottlenecks and
mitigate risks, we continuously monitor political and macro-
economic developments, markets, suppliers, and raw materials.
To this end, we have a cross-functional task force to identify
potential risks and develop suitable countermeasures at site level.
As well as making preparations to use substitute suppliers in an
emergency, we constantly monitor the business situation of
selected suppliers of key raw materials.

This procedure proved both helpful and effective in 2021 in deal-
ing with the additional supply risks caused by the coronavirus
pandemic that started 2020, and it will remain an important risk
mitigation element in any future flare-up of the pandemic situa-
tion. These supply risks are primarily characterized by heightened
market volatility. There are three factors, in particular, that play a
key role here. Firstly, the market environment is influenced by
political uncertainty and trade barriers. Secondly, the volatility is
characterized by pandemic-induced changes in end-markets and
the related regional shifts. Thirdly, restricted market availability
of chemical raw materials due to technical difficulties and low
inventory levels throughout industry, coinciding with rising
demand, plays a key role.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Markets and competition opportunities and risks

©8690090

The opportunities and risks arising from changes in the price
of petrochemical feedstocks mainly impact the Performance
Materials division and the Performance Intermediates business
line because of their high procurement volumes. Risks relating to
single sourcing and the restricted short-term availability of raw
materials mainly relate to the Nutrition & Care and Specialty
Additives divisions.

Supply chain

Compliance with sustainability criteria in the supply chain is a
central aspect of procurement. We expect our suppliers to share
our principles of entrepreneurial responsibility. We therefore
have our own code of conduct for suppliers, based on the princi-
ples of the UN Global Compact, the International Labour Stan-
dards issued by the International Labour Organization (ILO), and
the Responsible Care® initiative. This approach to sustainability
is also supported by the sector initiative Together for Sustaina-
bility, of which Evonik is a founding member, through the global
use of standardized assessments. Evonik’s principal suppliers and
the majority of critical suppliers have already taken part in these
assessments, which are evaluated by an impartial sustainability
rating company.

4. Research and development

Opportunities for Evonik also come from market-oriented
research and development (R&D), which we regard as an
important driver of profitable growth. Our R&D pipeline com-
prises a balanced mix of short-, mid-, and long-term projects. On
the one hand, we constantly strive to improve our processes in
order to strengthen our cost leadership, and on the other, our
projects open the door to new markets and new fields of tech-
nology. Our project portfolio is consistently aligned with our
growth engines and the innovation growth fields, which have
high sustainability benefits. Through our venture capital
70

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

program, we take stakes in companies whose know-how can
support us in joint developments. Aspects of digitalization are
becoming more significant.

Opportunities and risks in R&D relate to the viability of
planned product and process developments and the timing of
their implementation. We mainly see additional potential arising
from the introduction of new products that go beyond our pres-
ent planning, especially our Next Generation Solutions.

5. Production

As a specialty chemicals company, Evonik is exposed to the risk
of business interruptions, quality problems, and unexpected
technical and IT malfunctions. The pandemic constitutes a
heightened risk of business interruptions, either as a result of
shortages of workers at individual sites due to illness or quaran-
tine or as a result of raw material and supply chain problems.
Business operations could also be disrupted by climate-related
factors such as extreme weather events like hurricane Ida in the
USA in 2021. Capacity constraints could hold back organic
growth. We use complex production processes, some of them
with interdependent production steps. Consequently, disruption
and stoppages can adversely affect subsequent production steps
and products. The outage of production facilities and interrup-
tions in production workflows could have a significant negative

influence on business and earnings performance and could also
harm people and the environment. Group-wide policies on proj-
ect and quality management, highly qualified employees, and
regular maintenance of our plants effectively minimize these
risks. Insofar as is economically viable, we take out insurance to
cover damage to our plants and sites and production stoppages,
so that the financial consequences of potential production risks
are largely insured. Nevertheless, there is a risk of unforeseeable
individual incidents.

6. Other

Continuous efforts are made to improve efficiency in production,
procurement, and technology through the continuous improve-
ments process. This mainly comprises our efficiency enhance-
ment programs to support our strategy of sustainable growth and
enhance our competitiveness. There may be both opportunities
and risks relating to the achievement of cost-saving targets. The
possible risks include delays in implementation, the loss of key
personnel, ineffectiveness of measures, and higher costs for the
realization of measures. Project management, including involving
relevant stakeholders, is used to counter these risks.

7. Investments
Investments geared to creating and protecting value involve
inherent risks in connection with the selection, definition, and
execution of the projects. These risks are addressed using struc-
tured processes and well-established policies. For example,
defined risk assessment methods are used to mitigate the risk
inherent in the selection of projects, while project execution risks
are minimized through technical standards. Both projects that
are at the planning stage and those that have been approved and
have commenced are constantly monitored to track project
progress and changes in the market situation and are adjusted as
necessary.

Evonik regards planning and building new production facili-
ties in target regions and markets as a key element in leveraging
sustainable and profitable growth.

8. Mergers and acquisitions

Active portfolio management has high priority for Evonik as part
of our value-based management approach. We have set out clear
procedures for preparing, analyzing, and undertaking acquisitions

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Markets and competition opportunities and risks

©8690090

and divestments. In particular, these include clear rules on
accountability and approval processes. An intensive examination
of potential acquisition targets (due diligence) is undertaken
before they are acquired. This involves systematic identification
of all material opportunities and risks and an appropriate valua-
tion. Key aspects of this process are strategic focus, sustainability,
earnings power, and development potential on the one hand,
and any legal, financial, and environmental risks on the other.
New companies are rapidly integrated into the Evonik Group and
thus into our risk management and controlling processes. Every
transaction of this type entails a risk that integration of the
business may not be successful or that integration costs may be
unexpectedly high, thus jeopardizing realization of the planned
quantitative and qualitative targets such as synergies.

Where businesses no longer fit our strategy or meet our
profitability requirements despite optimization, we also examine
external options. If a planned divestment is not achieved success-
fully, this could generate risks that impact the Evonik Group’s
earnings position.

9. Energy markets and emissions trading
Evonik requires considerable amounts of energy from a wide
variety of sources for its chemical facilities and infrastructure.
The main sources are natural gas, electricity, and at present, still
coal. At several major sites, our power and steam requirements
are fully or partially met by resource-efficient co-generation
plants. We constantly monitor trends on the national and inter-
national energy markets, including the extended scope to use
“green” energy, enabling us to respond in a risk- and cost-con-
scious manner, which is compliant with our strategy.

In countries where the sourcing of energy is not state-regu-
lated, we procure and trade in energy and, where necessary,
71

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

emission allowances (CO, allowances) on the futures and spot
markets within the framework of defined risk strategies. The aim
is to balance the risks and opportunities of the volatile markets
for energy and CO, allowances. Depending on the development
of the general conditions and the ongoing market trend, which
led to record prices for many types of energy in 2021, our oper-
ating units could be faced with additional costs.

For our facilities within the scope of the European emissions
trading system (EU ETS), adverse effects arise from the structure
of the fourth trading period (2021 to 2030), especially a more
stringent benchmark for the allocation of free CO, allowances.
Moreover, we assume that the decision made in 2020 to raise the
EU climate target to a 55 percent reduction in CO, by 2030 will
result in a reduction in the allocation of free allowances and thus
to further costs. Since 2021, our German sites have been affected
by the national Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) for the traffic
and heat sectors (which are outside the scope of the EU ETS).
The related financial burden is only partially offset by the BEHG
carbon leakage ordinance, especially as it is currently contingent
upon the EU Commission’s approval for state aid. In other juris-
dictions, further climate protection legislation cannot be ruled
out or is currently planned. In the broader regulatory context, the
way in which the cost of renewables is allocated—possibly retro-
actively— among captive energy generators in Germany under
the Renewable Energies Act (EEG) is of particular significance
for Evonik. That applies to both the valuation of certain contrac
tual rights to the use of captive power plants by companies in the
Evonik Group and certain legal issues in connection with the
intersite supply of power from captive power generation. We are

currently involved in legal proceedings to clarify the second of
these issues. However, we assume that the captive generating
facilities that we operate at various sites and replacing the coal-
fired power plant currently in operation at the site in Marl (Ger-
many) by a highly efficient gas and steam turbine plant, which is
currently under construction, will play a part in safeguarding the
future competitiveness of our German sites. This also applies if
the new German government realizes its plans to end financing
of the cost of renewable energies through the electricity price.
Possible additional costs could arise from the increase in grid fees
resulting from the energy transition in Germany, including fur-
ther state-driven cost components and possible fundamental
changes to the grid fee system. To sum up, we are exposed to
fluctuations in the market price and cost of various energy
sources and CO, allowances of various types as a result of the
specific demand/supply situation and political events. These
entail both opportunities and risks.

10. Human resources

As a global corporation, we respect the principles of the Interna-
tional Charter of Human Rights, the ten principles of the UN
Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter-
prises, and the International Labour Standards of the Inter-
national Labour Organization (ILO).

Qualified specialists and managers are the basis for the
achievement of our strategic and operational targets and thus a
key competitive factor. Both the loss of key personnel and diffi-
culties in attracting and hiring skilled and talented staff could
therefore constitute a risk in this context.

To ensure that we can recruit and retain qualified staff to meet
our future requirements, we offer varied employment opportu-
nities worldwide, systematic personnel development, and com-
petitive remuneration. As a responsible employer, Evonik helps
he majority of employees build financial security to cover
adverse risk factors such as the risk of accident or disability and
o provide for retirement, either directly or through pension con-
ributions to external institutions. The arrangements are based on
he economic, legal, and tax situation in the various countries. In
addition to this, we foster the personal wellbeing of employees
hrough programs such as well@work, a range of consulting
offers for employees caring for close relatives, and support in
childcare. In this way, we retain and foster high-performers and
alented employees and position Evonik as an attractive employer
for prospective staff. We maintain close links to universities and
professional associations to help us recruit suitable youngsters.
Both our employer branding and many internal activities are
aligned to diversity. The aim is to make Evonik even more attrac
tive to talented specialists and managers.

Our strategic human resources planning identifies require-
ments for a five-year period, so timely steps can be taken to
cover future personnel needs. We have thus largely limited
potential human resources risks. Opportunities and risks for the
development of personnel expenses could come, for example,
from future collective agreements.

6.4 Legal/compliance opportunities
and risks

The opportunities and risks in this category are far more difficult
to quantify than market and competition risks, as they not only
have financial implications but often also involve reputational
risks for the company and/or criminal law consequences. Provi-
sions are set up on our balance sheet to cover the financial
impact. These are reflected in our system as reducing risk. In
view of this complexity, legal /compliance opportunities and risks
are not assigned to the opportunity/risk matrix illustrated above,
nor are they allocated to the risk quantification classes.

1. Compliance, law, and the regulatory
framework

Compliance means lawful business conduct. The principal com-
pliance rules are set out in the Evonik Code of Conduct, which
explicitly prohibits, for example, all forms of corruption, includ-
ing “facilitation payments,” and violation of antitrust regulations.
Risks could result from failure to comply with the corresponding
regulations. To minimize compliance risks, extensive training and
sensitization of employees are undertaken at face-to-face train-
ing sessions and/or through e-learning programs. Our code of
conduct is binding for all Evonik employees worldwide, including
the executive board and the governance bodies of all Evonik
companies. They are required to comply with the rules set forth
in the code of conduct, to ensure they are familiar with its con-
tent, and to take part in the relevant training."

1 See Declaration on corporate governance [) p. 86 ff.

Evonik monitors the observance of human rights along the value
chain. To minimize the related risks, we require compliance with
our code of conduct for suppliers, our global social policy, and
the policy statement on human rights.

Evonik is exposed to legal risks resulting, for example, from legal
disputes such as claims for compensation, and from administra-
tive proceedings and fines. In its operating business, the Evonik
Group is exposed to liability risks, especially in connection with
product liability, patent law, tax law, competition law, antitrust
law, and environmental law. Changes in public law could also
give rise to legal risks or materially alter such risk positions. As a
chemical company with its own power plants, risks of particular
relevance here are a possible change in the charges levied under
the German Renewable Energies Act (EEG) and amendments to
the European emissions trading regulations (see above).

Further, Evonik may be liable for guarantee claims relating to
divestments. Moreover, structured post-transaction management
closely monitors any liability and guarantee risks resulting from
divestments. We have developed a concept involving high quality
and safety standards to ensure a controlled approach to such legal
risks.

Insurance cover has been purchased for the financial conse-
quences of any loss that may nevertheless occur as a result of
damage to property, product liability claims, and other risks.
Where necessary, Evonik sets up provisions for legal risks.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

As a matter of principle, we refrain from disclosing the opportu-
nities and risks of potential legal proceedings or proceedings that
have commenced, in order not to influence our position.

With regard to employment law, there are risks relating, for
example, to the recalculation of pension commitments entered
into by Evonik and its legal predecessors.

Tax opportunities and risks relate to differences in the valua-
tion of business processes, capital expenditures, and restructur-
ing by the financial authorities, tax reforms in some countries,
and potential refunds or retroactive payments in the wake of
tax audits.

2. Information security and the protection of
intellectual property and know-how

Innovations play a significant part in Evonik’s business success.
Protecting know-how and intellectual property is therefore of
central importance. With markets growing ever closer and the
globalization of business, a competent approach to protecting our
competitive edge is a key element in our investment activities.
The company is also exposed to a risk that intellectual property
cannot be adequately protected, even through patents, especially
when building new production facilities in certain countries. Sim-
ilarly, the transfer of know-how in joint ventures and other forms
of cooperation also entails a risk of an outflow of expertise from
Evonik. For example, in the event of the possible separation from
a joint venture or other cooperation partner, there is no guarantee
73

FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 EVONIK

that the business partner will not continue to use know-how or
disclose it to third parties, thereby damaging Evonik’s competi-
tive position.

Measures to minimize and avoid such risks are coordinated by
the Group Security, Legal , and Intellectual Property Manage-
mentfunctions.

Cybersecurity risks

IT-assisted business processes are key elements in Evonik’s suc-
cess. Therefore, sustained protection of the availability, confiden-
tiality, and integrity of IT-assisted business processes are espe-
cially important. If these systems are compromised, there is a
significant risk that this could have a detrimental effect on our
business and production processes. To protect them and the
associated knowledge from cybercrime (including industrial espi-
onage and manipulation through electronic attacks) from both
within and outside the Evonik Group and to minimize such risks,
we have developed a cybersecurity strategy and established
organizational and technical measures. The secure use of infor-
mation systems is described in binding group-wide policies and
regulations and driven forward and monitored by an internal
control system.

In view of the considerable and continuously rising threat, we
regularly review our security measures, implement risk-based
countermeasures as required, and adapt them wherever neces-
sary. Training, including compulsory training in some cases, con-
stant information, for example, via the Evonik Group intranet and
internal social networking platforms, and awareness-raising cam-
Paigns are used to heighten employees’ awareness of the need
for cybersecurity. Evonik identifies those IT systems that are at
particular risk and implements appropriate protective measures.

1 Especially low availability of water.

At the same time, action is taken to raise managers’ awareness
of cybersecurity. The Evonik Cyber Defense Team (CDT) is
networked externally at various levels (Germany: member of the
German CERT network, Europe: member of TF-CSIRT*,
globally: member of FIRST).

3. Environmental risks

(environment, safety, health, quality)

Evonik is exposed to risks in the areas of occupational and plant
safety. For example, workplace accidents and incidents in pro-
duction facilities can cause injury to our employees or substance
releases that impair the health of our employees and local resi-
dents. Our guiding principles for safety are binding for all man-
agers and employees. In this way, Evonik makes it clear that
safety is a central element in its corporate culture. We analyze
accidents and incidents carefully so we can learn from them.
Moreover, audits are conducted at the request of the executive
board to check the controlled handling of such risks.

The aim of our product stewardship is timely identification
and evaluation of possible health and environmental risks in our
portfolio. We examine the entire value chain of each of our prod-
ucts—from procurement of the raw materials to delivery to our
industrial customers, who receive all relevant information on the
handling and disposal of our products. That includes, for exam-
ple, safety data sheets, and technical information sheets. As well
as complying with all statutory requirements such as the Euro-
pean chemicals regulation (REACH) and the Globally Harmo-
nized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS),
product stewardship at Evonik includes voluntary commitments
that go beyond these regulations.

In the event of a pandemic, Evonik could be exposed to unfore-
seeable staff shortages because employees are sick, in quaran-
tine, have to care for relatives, or are required to undertake pan-
demic-related civic tasks (e.g., civil protection, assisting public
health organizations). If the number of employees in production
facilities falls below the minimum level as a result, a controlled
safety shutdown of the production facilities would be necessary.
That would halt production. Evonik has carefully prepared pan-
demic plans to counter the risk of a pandemic. These contain
measures to maintain productivity and reduce the risk of infection
for employees, visitors, and contractors.

The effects of climate change are already visible today, for exam-
ple, in water stress’ and acute weather-related events such as low
water levels in the river Rhine and hurricanes. Alongside these
direct negative effects of climate change, we are also exposed to
risks resulting from stricter environmental regulations.

The group-wide environmental protection and quality
management system, which is validated as conforming to inter-
national standards, undergoes constant development and
improvement. As a responsible chemical company, Evonik
ensures that such processes are operated in accordance with the
principles of the global Responsible Care® initiative and the UN
Global Compact.

Adequate provisions have been established to secure or
remediate contaminated sites where necessary. Alongside the
need to adjust environmental provisions identified through struc-
tured internal processes, for example, as a result of changes in
the regulatory framework, further unplanned additions to such
provisions may be necessary.

6.5 Process/organization risks

1. General

This risk category relates to the interface between risk manage-
ment and the internal control system (ICS). In this category, risks
generally result from specific process shortcomings. Alongside
general weaknesses, these include, in particular, risks within the
ICS and the accounting-related ICS. Classification is therefore
based on the list of processes drawn up by Group Audit. Starting
from key corporate processes, the existence of relevant control
objectives and standard controls for the main risks identified is
checked. In view of the types of risk in this category, a purely
qualitative assessment is normally used.

The evaluation of specific risks resulting from weaknesses in
processes within the organizational units showed very little scope
to optimize existing processes because of the efficacy of the cur-
rent controls. The corresponding scope for improvement has
been identified. No signs of systematic errors in the Evonik
Group’s ICS were identified.

2. Internal control system for financial accounting
The main financial reporting risks are identified in the ICS
through a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. Controls
are defined for each risk area of the accounting process. Their

efficacy is reviewed at regular intervals and improved where nec-
essary. All elements of the control process are verified by the
internal audit function on the basis of random samples.

To ensure the quality of financial statements, we have a group-
wide policy, which defines uniform accounting and valuation
principles for all German and foreign companies included in the
consolidated financial statements for the Evonik Group. Apart
from a few immaterial exceptions, the financial statements of the
companies are prepared by Global Financial Services. Through
systematic process orientation, standardization, and the utiliza-
tion of economies of scale, this leverages sustained cost benefits
and also improves the quality of accounting. The Accounting
function (center of excellence) has developed a standardized
control matrix for the accounting-related internal transactional
control system. This is implemented in the three global shared
service centers: in Offenbach (Germany) for Germany, Austria,
Finland, Turkey, and Slovakia; in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) for
the Asia region and countries in the EMEA region not served by
the Offenbach center; and in San José (Costa Rica) for the Amer-
icas region. The aim is to ensure a uniform global standard for the
internal control system for financial accounting. The annual
financial statements of the majority of fully consolidated compa-
nies and joint operations are audited. In the few exceptions from
this rule, an upfront risk assessment is performed with the auditor.

All data are consolidated by the Accounting function using the
SAP SEM-BCS system. Group companies submit their financial
statements via a web-based interface. A range of technical vali-
dations is performed at this stage. Computerized and manual pro-
cess controls and checking by a second person are the key over-
sight functions performed in the financial reporting process. The
preparation of the monthly consolidated income statement and
hree quarterly reports allows us to gain experience with new
accounting issues and provide a sound basis for plausibilization of
he year-end accounts. The executive board receives monthly
reports, and quarterly reports are submitted to the audit commit-
ee of the supervisory board.

Aspects that may represent opportunities or risks for financial
reporting in the future are identified and evaluated early through
he risk management system. This ensures that risk management
can be closely aligned to controlling and accounting processes.
