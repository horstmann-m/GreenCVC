TeliaSonera Annual Report 2013

Introduction

The year in brief

2013 — an eventful year

e In early February, the Swedish law firm Mannhei-
mer Swartling released its report on TeliaSonera’s
investments in Uzbekistan. The investigation was
not able to establish that bribery or money launde-
ring had occurred; however, the suspicions of crime
expressed by the Swedish Prosecution Authority
could not be dismissed by the investigation. Serious
criticism was directed at TeliaSonera for short-
comings in the investment process. As a conse-
quence, Lars Nyberg left the company and a new
Board of Directors was elected at the April AGM. The
Board promptly launched a review of transactions in
Eurasia, led by Norton Rose Fulbright, and in June
appointed Johan Dennelind as President and CEO.
He assumed his position on September 1.

@ In March, we took an important step in the Swedish
market. As one of the first operators in Europe, we
offered the opportunity to connect multiple mobile
devices to one subscription, including unlimited calls
and text messages, with the possibility to share data
volumes within certain buckets. Data-centric pricing
has now been launched in Sweden, Denmark, Nor-
way, Lithuania and Finland.

® In March, TeliaSonera and the other members of the
Telecommunication Industry Dialogue signed guiding
principles on telecommunication and freedom of ex-
pression and privacy. We also entered into a two-year
collaboration with the Global Network Initiative (GNI)
to develop and expand this initiative further.

e The customer base continued to grow for all IP-
based services and the fiber roll-out regained
momentum. Around 28 percent of our customers are
connected via fiber in the Nordic and Baltic region.
During the summer, the number of TV customers
passed 600,000 in Sweden, reaching the number two
position in the Swedish TV market.

4G is now launched in all Nordic and Baltic countries,
in Spain and also in Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan
and Uzbekistan (scale trial).

In December, it was announced that following the
decision to change TeliaSonera’s operating model,
anew Group Management team will be formed as of
April 1, 2014.

© TeliaSonera is financially sound, with a robust gene-
ration of free cash flow and a solid capital structure.

Introduction

Letter from the CEO

Dear Shareholders,

2013 was another eventful and challenging year for the telecom industry and for
TeliaSonera. Despite an uncertain and troubling macroeconomic climate in many
of our markets, regulatory effects and rapidly changing customer behavior, we are
pleased to close the year with more or less flat organic revenues, a slight increase

in our EBITDA margin and solid free cash flow.

We have a lot to be proud of

| assumed the position as CEO in September 2013,

and my initial observations were that TeliaSonera has a
solid asset base, attractive footprint, strong brands and
competent people. We have a lot to be proud of. How-
ever, our position has weakened in too many markets
and it is vital to strengthen our competitiveness. In a
fast changing landscape we have to develop a com-
pany culture that encourages agility and innovation.

Closer to the customers

We have to understand our customers’ needs and
deliver a differentiated customer experience. We need
to reduce complexity regarding processes, products &
offerings and step up our competitiveness in our local
markets. The rapid development of our industry con-
tinues and legacy is being replaced with new technolo-
gies and business models. We maintain an active role
in this migration by expanding high speed internet via

fiber and 4G in order to enable people to communicate
even more with each other, with even better quality. We
are also determined to make our enterprise customers
even more competitive by offering tailored products

and services to best meet the core requirements of our
diverse customer segments. In 2013, we invested more
than SEK 16 billion in order to have high-quality net-

works, a prerequisite to be a leading telecom operator.

New business models

In March, we took an important initiative. As one of
the first operators in Europe we offered our customers
to connect multiple mobile devices to one subscrip-
tion, including unlimited calls and text messages, with
the possibility to share data volumes within certain
buckets. In our view, this is an important step and an
attractive service for the customer at the same time as
we move towards a more sustainable business model
in a world where the consumption of data is increas-
ing heavily. Data-centric pricing is now launched in
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Lithuania and Finland.

Introduction

Governance and ethical behavior

It's obvious that managing our business in a sustain-
able way is vital to our reputation and future success.
Creating a sustainable business is a key part of our
strategy and major actions have been taken during the
year in order to strengthen corporate governance.

I have launched a comprehensive program to rebuild
our reputation towards our stakeholder everywhere we
operate. This is a long journey, but a prerequisite for
our future survival. We can only sustain as a profitable
company long term by acting responsibly in everything
we do.

The sustainability work in 2013 has been focus-
ing on improving our governance and compliance. In
April the Board established a Sustainability and Ethics
Committee with the task to review the group’s internal
and external sustainability reporting, policies, action
plans and systems for risk management. | also imple-
mented an Ethics and Compliance function to enforce
the compliance with ethical and legal requirements.
Our key sustainability focus areas have continued to be
freedom of expression and privacy, customer privacy,
anti-corruption, sustainability in supply chain and en-
vironmental targets. We need to pro-actively promote
health and well-being at work for everyone who works
for or with TeliaSonera, therefore occupational health
and safety will be prioritized during 2014.

During the spring, TeliaSonera and the other
members of the Telecommunication Industry Dialogue
signed guiding principles on telecommunication and
freedom of expression and privacy. The principles pro-
vide guidance on how we should act to respect these
basic human rights. We also entered into a two-year
collaboration with the Global Network Initiative (GNI) to
develop and expand this initiative further.

We continued implementing the group environmen-
tal targets in all business units, identifying hotspots for
energy efficiency and ways to reduce our CO, emis-
sions. We have been looking into, and realizing, the
potential to use for example solar energy in Eurasia and
have currently over 500 base stations solar powered.
However, in 2013 we were unable to deliver positive
progress on our environmental targets, as energy ef-
ficiency decreased 5 percent and emissions increased
18 percent per subscription. This is mostly caused by
our efforts to improve the reported data quality and
accuracy.

“Creating a sustainable business is a key
part of our strategy and major actions

have been taken to strengthen corporate
governance.”

TeliaSonera is committed to follow United Nations
Global Compact 10 principles. Our sustainability per-
formance is reported in the Sustainability report where
you also find the progress regarding implementing the
principles. To assure the credibility, transparency and
balanced view of our sustainability issues, the Sustain-
ability report has been externally assured by third party.

Accountability and a winning
innovative culture

In order to compete effectively and to support long
term profitability, it is crucial to have an efficient organi-
zation and a sound cost base. We have to reduce com-
plexity to enable an efficient way of working, accelerate
decision making and ensure our employees stay skilled
and motivated.

Akey task during the fall has been to develop the
strategic roadmap for TeliaSonera. An important step in
this process was taken in December when we finalized
our new operating model, a country based structure
that will be launched in April 2014. The aim with this
change is to reduce overall complexity within the group,
enhance customer focus and clarify general account-
ability as well as establishing a winning culture and
mindset.

| want us to become a company much closer to our
customers, with clearer accountability for delivering su-
perior results in a sustainable, innovative and fun way.
This will help us unleash and reach our full potential.

Capture the opportunities

TeliaSonera is a financially sound and balanced com-
pany. Entering a new year we face many challenges but
also a lot of opportunities. I’m sure that that we have an
exciting year ahead of us.

Stockholm, March 5, 2014

mation, see section “Significant events in 2013.”

In this Report, comparative figures are provided in
parentheses following the operational and financial re-
sults and refer to the same item in the full year of 2012,
unless otherwise stated.

Mission, Vision and Strategy

Corporate and private customers value the freedom and flex-
ibility of high-quality internet and communication systems.
TeliaSonera provides network access and telecommunication
services that enable people and businesses to achieve what
they regard as important. Seeing the big picture is vital, but the
smaller details are just as essential in meeting customer needs.

Mission: To provide network access
and telecommunication services
TeliaSonera’s mission is to help people and companies
communicate in an easy, efficient and environmentally-
friendly way, by providing network access and telecom-
munication services. Our focus is to deliver a first-rate
customer experience, while ensuring the quality of our
networks and maintaining a cost-efficient structure.
TeliaSonera is an international group with a global
strategy, but wherever we operate we act as a local
company.

Our focus areas

+ Providing world-class customer experience
+ High-quality networks

+ Driving cost efficiency

Vision: To contribute to a world with
better opportunities

TeliaSonera is a world-class service company, recog-
nized as an industry leader. We are proud pioneers of
the telecom industry, a position we have gained by be-
ing innovative, reliable and customer-friendly. Wherever
we operate, we act in a responsible way, based on a
firm set of values and business principles. Our services
form a major part of people’s daily lives — for business,
education and pleasure.

Shared values
+ Add value

+ Show respect

+ Make it happen

Strategy: Solutions based on deep
understanding

Widespread access to reliable communication services
has become pivotal in our daily lives both at home and
at work. Since the arrival of smartphones and tablets,
we rely increasingly on digital transmission for social
and business communication. New pricing models
have contributed to making communication services
effective, transparent and personal. We expect this
trend to increase and evolve in the coming years.
TeliaSonera’s strategy is to deliver tailored products
and services to best meet the core requirements of
our diverse customer segments. We provide solutions
formed by our in-depth understanding of our custom-
ers’ present and future needs. We create shareholder
value by delivering services in a cost-effective and
sustainable manner, which leads to improved profitabil-
ity and strong cash flow.

Three major challenges

Our customers’ behavior has been affected by the
rapid digitalization of data within our society. Usage
has become more dynamic and enhanced by videos,
moving images, interactive entertainment and social
networks. With consideration to this development, we
believe our industry faces three main imminent chal-
lenges:

1. Continued rebalancing of data pricing to follow cur-
rent business models

2. Fixed-mobile convergence and bundling of services
3. Development of value-added services linked to our
core business, e.g. cloud storage and virtual meetings

Our customers depend on us to prioritize our commit-
ment to be their access provider — it is our primary role.


--- Page 9 ---

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2013

Board of Directors’ Report

Additionally, we pledge to add value through applica-
tions that relate to network access to reduce churn and
increase data transfer-speed and capacity.

An industry leader

Corporations and customers value quality, flexible B2B
product portfolios, outstanding customer care and
early implementation. Mobile internet has revolution-
ized the business landscape.

We at TeliaSonera understand our customers’ needs, which
include:
High-quality networks — Our services are reliable in terms of
coverage, speed and up-time.
World-class customer experience — We strive to provide easy-
to-use services with a “touch and feel” experience.

Business-to-business (B2B) product portfolios - We assure
customer needs are met with integrated business solutions.
Early implementation — We get new technology and services
to customers faster.

Competitive pricing — We exploit the potential of economies
of scale.

Our unified brand

People trust a brand they know. The unified brand fur-
ther strengthens our position on the international scene
by manifesting TeliaSonera’s unique combination of
international reach and local connection.

We aim to be seen as the most attractive brand in
our industry in each market, providing the best cus-
tomer experience. We also aim to be viewed as smart,
innovative and local, wherever we operate.

Risks and Risk Management

TeliaSonera operates in several geographical markets
and with a broad range of products and services in the
highly competitive and regulated telecommunications
industry. In addition, certain TeliaSonera markets are
highly challenging when it comes to corruption and
violations of human rights. As a result, TeliaSonera is
subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Telia-
Sonera has defined risk as anything that could have a
material adverse effect on the achievement of TeliaSon-
era’s goals. Risks can be threats, uncertainties or lost
opportunities relating to TeliaSonera’s current or future
operations or activities.

TeliaSonera has an established risk management
framework in place to regularly identify, analyze, as-
sess, and report risks and uncertainties, and to miti-
gate such risks when appropriate. Risk management
is an integral part of TeliaSonera’s business planning
process and monitoring of business performance.
Main risks relate to industry and market conditions, op-
erations and strategic activities, associated companies
and joint operations, ethics and sustainability, owner-
ship of TeliaSonera shares, financial management and
financial reporting.

n

Risks and uncertainties related to business, ethics

and sustainability as well as shareholder issues are
described in Note C34, key sources of estimation
uncertainty in Note C2 and financial risks in Note C26
to the consolidated financial statements. TeliaSonera’s
enterprise risk management, governance and process
as well as internal controls over financial reporting are
described in the Corporate Governance Statement.

Ethics and Sustainability

TeliaSonera’s ethical and sustainability work encom-
passes all efforts to realize economic, environmental
and social responsibilities and opportunities through
responsible business practices.

This involves ensuring environmental and social
sustainability along the supply chain, respecting hu-
man rights, complying with ethical business practices
in all markets, improving the protection of customers’
privacy, taking care of the well-being of the employ-
ees, reducing TeliaSonera’s and its customers’ carbon
footprint, protecting children online, and supporting
research related to exposure to electromagnetic fields.

TeliaSonera recognizes its duty to have a positive
effect on society, the environment, the employees and
the value chain, and to minimize and mitigate any nega-
tive impacts TeliaSonera’s operations might have.

In 2013, among other actions taken, a new Board
of Directors committee, the Sustainability and Eth-
ics Committee, was established as well as extended
quarterly Group Management meetings focusing on
governance, risk, ethics and compliance issues (GREC
meetings). The main sustainability focus areas in 2013
were:

+ Freedom of expression and privacy
+ Customer privacy

+ Anti-corruption

+ Sustainability along the supply chain
+ Environmental responsibility

See also section “Significant events in 2013” and the
Corporate Governance Report, sections “Sustainabil-
ity and Ethics Committee,” “Sustainability, ethics and
compliance,” “Group policies” and “Enterprise Risk
Management” for information on actions taken in 2013.

Already in April, the Board of Directors launched a
review of transactions in Eurasia, led by the internation-
al law firm Norton Rose Fulbridght (NRF). For additional
information, see the Sustainability Report, section
“Review of Eurasian transactions”. As a consequence
of the ongoing review, four senior employees had to
leave TeliaSonera in late November as it was evident to
the Board of Directors and the CEO that the processes
for conducting some transactions had not been in line
with sound business practices.

At the end of the year, data-centric pricing had been

launched in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Lithuania.

During the year, TeliaSonera continued to invest in
network capacity and coverage and to improve cost
efficiency in the networks, as follows:

+ In May, Telia in Sweden announced that it will further
invest in 4G and mobile coverage, expand within
fiber and selectively target acquisitions of existing
fiber networks. Telia will significantly expand the 4G
network in Sweden, targeting 92 percent geographi-
cal coverage in the next two years, utilizing existing
2G/3G infrastructure to ensure a cost efficient roll-
out. The investment amounts to approximately SEK 5
billion annually during a three-year period.

+ In May, TeliaSonera secured 800 MHz spectrum
enabling faster 4G roll-out in Estonia. By mid-June,
the 4G network was ready to use and has a territorial
coverage of over 95 percent.

+ In August, TeliaSonera’s Spanish operator Yoigo

(Xfera Moviles S.A.) had reached a series of agree-

ments with Telefonica’s subsidiary Movistar enabling

Yoigo to sell combined fixed-mobile services to its

customers. In addition, Movistar will be able to offer

its customers better and faster mobile services on

Yoigo’s 4G network. In parallel, Yoigo and Telefonica

have reached an agreement with Abertis Telecom

to acquire mobile telephone towers from Yoigo and

Telefonica, with the aim to improve cost efficiency.

In October, TeliaSonera’s Finnish operator Sonera

(TeliaSonera Finland Oyj) invested in new 4G fre-

quencies in the 800 MHz band. Sonera secured 2*10

MHz frequencies in the 800 MHz band. The licenses

granted for the 800 MHz band are valid for 20 years

starting from 2014, and the price for the new fre-
quency blocks was EUR 41.2 million including the
administrative fees for the auction. Payment to the

Finnish regulatory authority Ficora will be made in

equal installments during the next five years.

+ In December, TeliaSonera’s Norwegian operator Net-
Com (TeliaSonera Norge AS) invested in new 4G fre-
quencies in the 800 MHz band. Along with prolonged
licenses in 900 MHz band and more 4G frequencies
in the 1,800 MHz band, the investment of NOK 626.7
million underlined the ambition to support customers
with high-speed data connections across Norway.

+ At year-end, TeliaSonera had launched 4G services
in 10 countries and been awarded 4G licenses in
2 more countries. The 3G licenses in Georgia and Ne-
pal were renewed during the year.

During the year, the Board of Directors and manage-
ment further increased the efforts to develop principles
and processes that respect human rights and protect
TeliaSonera from corruption.

+ On February 1, the Swedish law firm Mannheimer
Swartling (MSA), finalizing the assignment given by
the Board of Directors in October 2012, presented
its review of TeliaSonera’s investments in Uzbeki-
stan. The investigation was not able to establish that
bribery or money laundering had occurred; however,
the suspicions of crime expressed by the Swedish
Prosecution Authority could not be dismissed by the
investigation. Serious criticism was directed at Telia-
Sonera for shortcomings in the investment process
and that the internal controls were not sufficient. On
the same day, the Board of Directors issued a state-
ment, concluding that the investments were not car-
ried out in a satisfactory manner and that the Board
concurred with and shared MSA's criticism.

On March 12, TeliaSonera announced that the com-
pany, and its fellow founding members of the Tele-
communication Industry Dialogue, had published the

signed guiding principles on telecommunication and
freedom of expression and privacy. The principles are
the result of two years of dialogue. In addition, the
Global Network Initiative (GNI) announced a two-year
collaboration with the Industry Dialogue group. By
working together, the Industry Dialogue and GNI aim
to advance freedom of expression and privacy rights
in the Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) sector more effectively.

On April 3, the Board of Directors at its statutory
meeting decided to establish a Sustainability and
Ethics Committee, tasked to work forward with
sustainability issues to safeguard that TeliaSonera is
doing the right things and is working in a correct way.
On April 18, the Board of Directors launched a review
of transactions in Eurasia, led by the international

law firm Norton Rose Fulbright (NRF). For additional
information, see the Corporate Governance Report,
section “Review of Eurasian transactions.”

On November 29, four senior employees had to leave
TeliaSonera as a consequence of the ongoing review
regarding transactions made in Eurasia. On the basis
of the information and conclusions to that date it was
evident to the Board of Directors and the CEO that
the processes for conducting some transactions had
not been in line with sound business practices. The
Board also decided to hand over the material from
the NRF review to the Swedish Prosecution Authority
as part of the continuous dialogue and information-
sharing started in 2012.

Other actions during the year included, but was not
limited to, the establishment of an Ethics and Compli-
ance Office, headed by a Chief Ethics and Compli-
ance Officer reporting to the CEO; the establishment
of an extended Group Management meeting, assem-
bled quarterly to discuss and decide on governance,
risk, ethics and compliance issues (GREC meeting);
group-wide roll-out of an e-learning tool to enforce
the implementation of TeliaSonera’s Code of Ethics
and Conduct with focus on anti-corruption and issu-
ing and initiating the implementation of new group
policies on freedom of expression in telecommunica-
tions and sponsorships. For additional information,
see the Corporate Governance Report, sections
“Sustainability, ethics and compliance”, “Group poli-
cies” and “Enterprise Risk Management.”

In December 2013, TeliaSonera announced a change
of its operating model to be launched April 1, 2014. The
new operating model will improve TeliaSonera’s local
operations’ ability to provide an even better customer
experience and at the same time clarify performance
accountability. The countries will be the leading dimen-
sion and the current business area layer is removed
from the existing organization. The country structure
will be grouped in three geographical areas; Europe,
Eurasia and Sweden. It will also strengthen the ability
to enforce and follow up the sustainability, compliance

and governance agendas, and support local manage-
ment and staff in this regard. Until April 1, 2014, Telia-
Sonera will prepare by appointing heads of the new key
functions, and by adapting processes and supporting
systems. The new Group Management team will consist
of twelve members with a mix of international experi-
ence and relevant industry background, combining
new people and outside experience with high perform-
ing existing members. TeliaSonera will report according
to the new structure as of the second quarter of 2014.
During 2013, changes in the Board of Directors and
TeliaSonera Group Management were as follows:
On April 3, six new members of the Board of Direc-
tors were elected and the Board members are Marie
Ehrling, Chair, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Vice-Chair, Mats
Jansson, Mikko Kosonen, Nina Linander, Martin Lor-
entzon, Per-Arne Sandstr6ém and Kersti Strandqvist.
On February 1, Lars Nyberg resigned from his posi-
tion as President and CEO of TeliaSonera and Per-
Arne Blomquist, Executive Vice President and CFO,
was appointed acting President and CEO.
On February 6, Veysel Aral, CEO of AO Kcell and Re-
gional Head of Central Asia, was appointed President
of Business area Eurasia. In this role, he succeeded
Tero Kivisaari, who managed dual roles since his
appointment as President of Business area Mobility
Services in October 2012.
On February 6, Christian Luiga, Head of Corporate
Control, was appointed acting CFO as a conse-
quence of Per-Arne Blomquist being appointed act-
ing President and CEO.
On June 14, it was announced that Cecilia Edstrom
would leave her position as Head of Group Commu-
nications at TeliaSonera during the summer of 2013
and on November 5, Peter Borsos was appointed
new Head of Group Communications.
On June 16, the Board of Directors appointed Johan
Dennelind to the position of President and CEO of
TeliaSonera. Johan Dennelind assumed the position
on September 1.
On August 15, Jonas Bengtsson was appointed Gen-
eral Counsel of TeliaSonera.
On October 3, Sverker Hannervall was appointed
acting President of Business area Mobility Services.
He assumed the position with immediate effect
and remained in his position as member of Group
Management and Head of Business Services. He
succeeded Tero Kivisaari, whose role in TeliaSonera’s
criticized investments in Uzbekistan, and the atten-
tion surrounding them, made it impossible for him to
act with the internal and external authority necessary.

On November 29, TeliaSonera’s Executive Vice
President and CFO Per-Arne Blomquist had to leave
his position effective immediately. Christian Luiga,
previously Head of CEO Office, assumed the position
as acting CFO.

On December 16, Erik Hallberg, President of Telia-
Sonera International Carrier within Business area
Broadband Services, replaced Veysel Aral as Presi-
dent of Business Area Eurasia.

In March, the Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB)

decided to appoint three independent members to the

Board of Directors of TeliaSonera’s associated compa-

ny Turkcell, replacing three Board members represent-

ing each of the major shareholders. In August, CMB
took further action and resolved on two issues. Firstly,

CMB terminated the tenures of all remaining members

of the Turkcell Board of Directors elected by the share-

holders and directly appointed two new members.

Secondly, each major shareholder was requested to

nominate two independent board member candidates

each. On September 2, TeliaSonera applied to CMB
and nominated Mr. Erik Belfrage and Mr. Jan Rudberg
as independent candidates. The application was ac-
cepted and CMB appointed TeliaSonera’s independent
candidates as members of the Board of Directors in

Turkcell on September 13.

In April, TeliaSonera acquired 90,000 own shares
to cover commitments under its Long term incentive
program 2010/2013. For more information on these
programs, see section “Long-term incentive program
2013/2016” and Note C31 to the consolidated financial
statements.

In 2013, TeliaSonera made a number of targeted
acquisitions and divestitures (see section “Acquisitions
and Divestitures” for further information). In April, Telia-
Sonera also announced that it had decided to continue
developing its Spanish operator Yoigo.

During the year, TeliaSonera in line with its funding
strategy of diversification and increasing the duration of
the debt portfolio issued bonds under its existing EUR
11 billion EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) program:

+ In August, a 20-year Eurobond of EUR 350 million,
maturing in September 2033. The re-offer yield was
set at 3.558 percent per annum equivalent to Euro
Mid-swaps +85 basis points.

+ In November, a 10-year bond issue of SEK 1,850
million in the Swedish market, maturing in November
2023. The three tranche deal was in one fixed tranche
with an annual coupon of 3.625 percent and two
floating tranches with a spread of 100 basis points to
3-month Stibor.

The addressable cost base, in local currencies and
excluding acquisitions and disposals, decreased

1.6 percent compared to last year, with decreases in
both Mobility Services (-3.4 percent) and Broadband
Services (-2.9 percent) offsetting the slight increase
in Eurasia (0.6 percent). Excluding Spain, which was
not part of the efficiency measures (see below), the
group’s addressable cost base decreased 2.8 percent
and Mobility Services 7.8 percent.

Personnel expenses, in local currencies and exclud-
ing acquisitions and disposals, increased 0.6 percent
compared to 2012. Both Mobility Services and Broad-
band Services lowered personnel expenses, while
Eurasia increased. Also Group functions reported an
increase, to a large extent due to a decrease in capital-
ized wages related to IT projects. Group headcount was
reduced by 1,825 employees during the year.

Marketing expenses, in local currencies and exclud-
ing acquisitions and disposals, declined 7.4 percent,
with Mobility Services driving the development for
equipment subsidies, sales commissions and advertis-
ing. Other expenses were reduced in almost all spend
categories except energy, most notably in IT expenses.

Amortization, depreciation and impairment losses
decreased 25.9 percent to SEK 15,215 million (20,542),
where 2012 included goodwill impairment charges of
SEK 7,534 million related to Mobility Services’ opera-
tions in Norway and Lithuania, and Broadband Servic-
es’ operations in Norway. In 2013, goodwill impairment
charges were related to Mobility Services’ operations
in Denmark and Lithuania, and Broadband Services’
operations in Denmark. Amortization and depreciation
excluding non-recurring items increased 0.5 percent
to SEK 13,036 million (12,977). In local currencies and
excluding acquisitions and disposals, the decrease was
2.5 percent.

Other operating income and expenses, net exclud-
ing amortization, depreciation and impairment losses,
was SEK -1,575 million (-434).

Non-recurring items

Non-recurring items affecting operating income totaled
SEK -4,072 million (-282), mainly related to goodwill
impairment charges in Denmark and Lithuania, asset
write-downs in Kazakhstan, a capital loss in connection
with the divestment of Nepal Satellite, settlement of an
interconnect court case in Azerbaijan, scrapping of old
IT legacy systems and restructuring charges in connec-
tion with the cost efficiency program.

The following table presents non-recurring items
for 2013 and 2012. These items are not included in
“EBITDA excluding non-recurring items” or in “Op-
erating income excluding non-recurring items,” but
included in the total results for TeliaSonera and for each

Earnings

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, decreased 1.6
percent to SEK 35,584 million (36,171). In local curren-
cies and excluding acquisitions and disposals, EBITDA,
excluding non-recurring items, increased 1.7 percent.
The main reason is the continued net sales volume-de-
crease in Broadband Services aggravated by a nega-
tive product mix shift from high-margin to low-margin
products. The decline in Broadband Services is partly
offset by the net sales increase in Eurasia, driven by
Uzbekistan and Nepal. The EBITDA margin increased
to 35.0 percent (34.5) as a result of the cost efficiency
program and supported by interconnect rate reduc-
tions.

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items,
decreased 0.5 percent to SEK 28,534 million (28,682),
mainly due to the EBITDA drop in Broadband Services
which, however, is largely compensated for by the
increase in Eurasia. Income from associated compa-
nies contributed positively with a strong operational im-
provement in Turkcell. The contribution from MegaFon
was flattish as the negative impact on earnings from

a lower effective ownership canceled out the underly-
ing performance improvement. The operating margin,
excluding income from associated companies and
non-recurring items affecting operating income, was
22.2 percent (22.1).

Financial net, taxes and non-controlling
interests

Financial items totaled SEK -3,094 million (-3,918).
Net interest expenses decreased to SEK -2,918 million
(-3,181) due to lower average indebtedness. Financial
items were negatively impacted by exchange rate ef-
fects related to the operations in Eurasia.

Income taxes increased to SEK 4,601 million (3,314).
The effective tax rate was 21.5 percent (13.5). Follow-
ing the Finnish Parliament decision in December 2013
to reduce the corporate income tax rate in Finland from
24.5 percent to 20.0 percent, a negative one-time ef-
fect of SEK 675 million due to net releases of deferred
tax assets was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. In
the fourth quarter of 2012, income taxes were positively
impacted by SEK 1,225 million as a one-time effect of
the income tax rate cut in Sweden. The effective tax rate
going forward is expected to be around 20 percent.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests
in subsidiaries increased to SEK 1,797 million (1,282),
of which SEK 1,619 million (1,042) was related to the
Eurasian operations and SEK 133 million (197) to the
LMT Group and the TEO Group.

Net income attributable to owners of the parent
company decreased 24.7 percent to SEK 14,970 million
(19,886) and earnings per share to SEK 3.46 (4.59).

CAPEX

CAPEX (capital expenditures) increased to SEK 16,332
million (15,685) and the CAPEX-to-sales ratio to 16.1
percent (15.0). CAPEX included continued investments
in network capacity, coverage and modernization, and
increased investments in fiber roll-out. In addition,
telecom licenses and frequency permits were acquired
or renewed in Finland, Norway, Estonia, Georgia and
Nepal. Fees for the commercial license in Uzbekistan,
terminating in 2016, were capitalized. CAPEX, exclud-
ing license and spectrum fees, amounted to SEK
14,565 million (15,332) and the CAPEX-to-sales ratio
was 14.3 percent (14.6).

Goodwill decreased by SEK 1.9 billion to SEK 67.3
billion, mainly due to impairment charges of SEK 1.2
billion related to the operations in Denmark and Lithu-
ania and negative exchange rate differences of SEK 0.9
billion. Additional goodwill from business combinations
was SEK 0.3 billion. Other intangible assets were stable
at SEK 14.2 billion. Capital expenditures (CAPEX) in
other intangible assets were SEK 3.7 billion, of which
licenses and spectrum fees SEK 1.8 billion. Amortiza-
tion amounted to SEK 2.8 billion and impairment losses
on frequency permits and obsolete IT systems and
platforms to SEK 1.1 billion. The currency effects were
immaterial.

Property, plant and equipment increased by SEK 2.1
billion through CAPEX and advances totaling SEK 12.7
billion and decreased due to depreciation and impair-
ment losses amounting to SEK 10.2 billion. Exchange
rate differences were negative at SEK 0.4 billion.

Financial assets comprise investments in associ-
ated companies and joint ventures, deferred tax assets,
pension obligation assets and other non-current as-
sets. The carrying value of associated companies and
joint ventures was stable at SEK 29.4 billion. Share of

net income in the companies amounting to SEK 5.9
billion added value, as did treasury share transactions
in MegaFon and acauisitions totaling SEK 0.6 billion,
offset by dividends received, in total SEK 2.2 billion.
Mainly due to the depreciation of the Turkish lira, cur-
rency effects had a negative impact of SEK 4.4 billion.

Deferred tax assets decreased by utilizing differ-
ences between tax base and carrying value related to
amortization and depreciation of non-current assets.
The enacted Finnish corporate income tax rate cut as of
2014 resulted in one-off net releases of deferred tax as-
sets of SEK 0.7 billion. Deferred tax liabilities (included
in Provisions) declined slightly. All in all, the net de-
ferred tax liability of SEK 2.9 billion in 2012 increased to
SEK 4.6 billion at year-end 2013.

Other non-current assets include a SEK 3,956 mil-
lion (5,675) receivable on AF Telecom, representing the
not yet paid consideration for the 2012 sale of shares in
the associated company OAO Telecominvest in Russia.
The current portion of the not yet paid consideration
was SEK 1,978 million (1,884).

Net working capital (inventories and non-interest-
bearing receivables, less non-interest-bearing liabilities
and excluding foreign exchange rate derivatives and
accrued interest) ended at SEK -0.0 billion (-0.3).

Total equity increased 3.5 percent to SEK 112.9
billion (109.1). Shareholders’ equity rose to SEK 108.3
billion (105.2), positively impacted by net income of
SEK 15.0 billion and remeasurement effects on pension
obligations amounting to SEK 3.4 billion. Dividends of
SEK 12.3 billion and exchange rate differences of SEK
3.2 billion had a negative impact. Equity attributable to
non-controlling interests increased to SEK 4.6 billion
(4.0). Dividends to non-controlling interests were SEK
1.0 billion, down from the SEK 3.1 billion reported in
2012 following the one-off dividends made in conjunc-
tion with the IPO of Kcell in Kazakhstan.

In 2013, rising yields on mortgage bonds, used as
reference rates when discounting pension obligations,
resulted in remeasurement effects reducing the present
value of the pension obligations. At year-end 2012,
the total pension liability (included in Provisions) was
SEK 4.7 billion, while at year-end 2013, certain pension
plans had turned to an overfunded status (reported in
Financial assets) totaling SEK 1.6 billion and liabilities in
the underfunded plans had declined to SEK 1.5 billion,
leading to a reported total net pension obligation asset
of SEK 0.1 billion.

Total gross borrowings decreased slightly, with
some shift towards short-term borrowings totaling SEK
10.6 billion (9.4). Long-term borrowings were SEK 80.1
billion (82.2). Positively impacted by a satisfactory free
cash flow generation in 2013, cash and cash equiva-
lents increased to SEK 31.7 billion (29.8). Net debt
decreased from SEK 59.4 billion to SEK 55.8 billion.

Credit facilities

TeliaSonera believes that its bank credit facilities and
open-market financing programs are sufficient for the
present liquidity requirements. At year-end, Telia-
Sonera’s surplus liquidity (short-term investments

and cash and bank) totaled SEK 32.1 billion (30.0). In
addition, the total available unutilized amount under
committed bank credit facilities as well as overdraft and
short-term credit facilities at year-end was SEK 10.2
billion (11.3).

TeliaSonera retained its good credit ratings. Stand-
ard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors
Service, respectively, confirmed its credit rating on
TeliaSonera AB of A-/A3 for long-term borrowings and
A2/Prime-2 for short-term borrowings, with a stable
outlook.

TeliaSonera generally seeks to arrange its financ-
ing through the parent company TeliaSonera AB. The
primary means of external borrowing are described
in Notes C20 and C26 to the consolidated financial
statements. In 2013, TeliaSonera AB issued some SEK
4.9 billion equivalent in the debt capital markets under
its EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) program. The new
funding was denominated in EUR and SEK and issued
on along-term basis. At year-end, the average time to
maturity of TeliaSonera AB’s overall debt portfolio was
approximately 8.2 years.

At the end of 2013, TeliaSonera AB had no Commer-
cial Papers outstanding.

Cash repatriation

In general, TeliaSonera has no cash repatriation issues
related to its operations in emerging market countries.
As of December 31, 2013, such issues existed in three
countries: Uzbekistan due to ongoing foreign exchange
restrictions and currency conversion issues, Nepal due
to administrative issues regarding a dividend distribu-
tion and Turkey due to ongoing corporate governance
issues on shareholder level in the associated company
Turkcell prohibiting dividend distribution.

Cash flow

Free cash flow generation, excluding dividends from
the associated company MegaFon, increased 19.6
percent to SEK 14.4 billion in 2013 from SEK 12.0 billion
in 2012.

Cash flow from operating activities decreased to SEK
31.0 billion (38.9). The positive impact of dividends
from MegaFon was, net of taxes, SEK 1.9 billion in
2013 and SEK 11.7 billion in 2012 as a result of one-off
payments ahead of MegaFon’s IPO in November this
year. Lower cash inflow from underlying operations was
compensated for mainly by lower tax payments and a
positive impact from changes in working capital. After
a number of years with negative cash flow generation
from changes in working capital, 2013 ended positively
at SEK 0.7 billion (-1.1).

Cash CAPEX (cash used in capital expenditures)
decreased by SEK 0.4 billion. Payments for the
acquired Finnish license will be made according to a

20

5-year installment plan. In total, free cash flow (cash
flow from operating activities less capital expenditures)
decreased to SEK 16.3 billion (23.7).

Cash inflow from other investing activities, total-
ing SEK 0.4 billion (8.8), consists of acquisitions and
divestments, changes in loans receivable and in short
term investments, and repayments from or additional
contributions to pension funds. Cash paid for acquisi-
tions was SEK 1.4 billion (0.6), while cash received for
divesting equity instruments and other assets was SEK
1.9 billion in 2013 compared to SEK 9.4 billion in 2012,
mainly related to the MegaFon transactions. Net cash
used for granting loans was SEK 0.1 billion (0.2).

Cash outflow from financing activities in 2013, total-
ing SEK 15.0 billion (15.2), includes dividends paid to
shareholders of the parent company of SEK 12.3 billion
(12.3) and to non-controlling interests of SEK 1.3 billion
(3.9). In 2012, other transactions with non-controlling
interests resulted in a net outflow of SEK 8.8 billion. Net
outflow from new and repaid borrowings in 2013 was
SEK -2.7 billion (inflow 11.9). Settlement of hedging
activities was positive at SEK 1.3 billion (negative 2.1).

See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and
related notes to the consolidated financial statements
for further details.

Outlook for 2014

Net sales in local currencies, excluding acquisitions
and disposals, are expected to be around the same
level as in 2013. Currency fluctuations may have a ma-
terial impact on reported figures in Swedish krona.

The EBITDA margin, excluding non-recurring items,
is expected to be around the same level as in 2013
(35.0 percent).

The CAPEX-to-sales ratio is expected to be approxi-
mately 15 percent, excluding license and spectrum
fees.

Efficiency Measures

In the third quarter report of 2012, TeliaSonera an-
nounced efficiency measures with a target to reduce
the cost base by SEK 2 billion net over a period of two
years ending 2014, affecting 2,000 employees.

The redundancies related to the efficiency measures
have been completed and the non-recurring costs
amounted to SEK 1.2 billion in 2013.

The accumulated savings amounted to approximate-
ly SEK 1 billion at the end of 2013.

For 2013, the Board of Directors proposes to the An-
nual General Meeting (AGM) an ordinary dividend of
SEK 3.00 (2.85) per share, totaling SEK 12,990 million
(12,341), or 86.8 percent (62.1) of net income attribut-
able to owners of the parent company.

trading in shares entitling shareholders to dividend be
set for April 2, 2014, and that the first day of trading in
shares excluding rights to dividend be set for April 3,
2014. The recommended record date at Euroclear Swe-
den for the right to receive dividend will be April 7, 2014.
If the AGM votes to approve the Board’s proposals,

the dividend is expected to be distributed by Euroclear

According to its dividend policy, TeliaSonera shall target
a solid investment grade long-term credit rating (A- to
BBB+) to secure the company’s strategically important
financial flexibility for investments in future growth, both
organically and by acquisitions. The ordinary dividend
shall be at least 50 percent of net income attributable
to owners of the parent company. In addition, excess
capital shall be returned to shareholders after the
Board of Directors has taken into consideration the
company’s cash at hand, cash flow projections and
investment plans in a medium term perspective, as well
as capital market conditions.

The Board of Directors has, according to Chapter
18 Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act, assessed
whether the proposed dividend is justified. The Board
of Directors assesses that:
+ The parent company’s restricted equity and the
group’s total equity attributable to the shareholders
of the parent company, after the distribution of profits
in accordance with the proposal, will be sufficient in
relation to the scope of the parent company’s and the
group’s business.
The proposed dividend does not jeopardize the
parent company’s or the group’s ability to make
the investments that are considered necessary. The
proposal is consistent with the established cash flow
forecast under which the parent company and the
group are expected to manage unexpected events
and temporary variations in cash flows to a reason-
able extent.

The full statement by the Board of Directors on the
same will be included in the AGM documents. See also
Proposed Appropriation of Earnings.

Proposal for Share Repurchase
Authorization

In order to provide the Board of Directors with an instru-
ment to adapt and improve TeliaSonera’s capital struc-
ture, the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual
General Meeting on April 2, 2014, resolves to authorize
the Board of Directors to acquire the company’s own
shares. The authorization may be exercised on one or
more occasions before the Annual General Meeting
2015. The maximum number of treasury shares held by
the company may not exceed 10 percent of all shares in
the company.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2013

Board of Directors’ Report

As of December 31, 2013, TeliaSonera’s issued and
outstanding share capital totaled SEK 13,856,271,299
distributed among 4,330,084,781 shares. All issued
shares have been paid in full and carry equal rights to
vote and participate in the assets of the company. At
the general meeting of shareholders, each shareholder
is entitled to vote for the total number of shares she or
he owns or represents. Each share is entitled to one
vote. TeliaSonera holds no own shares. As of Decem-
ber 31, 2013, TeliaSonera’s Finnish pension fund held
0.01 percent of the company’s shares and votes.

There are no provisions in either the Swedish leg-
islation or in TeliaSonera AB’s Articles of Association
that would limit the possibility to transfer TeliaSonera
shares. TeliaSonera is not aware of any agreements
between major shareholders of the company regarding
the TeliaSonera shares.

The Board of Directors does not currently have any
authorization by the general meeting of shareholders to
issue new shares but has the authorization to repur-
chase a maximum of 10 percent of the company’s total
number of outstanding shares.

In case of a change of control in TeliaSonera AB, the
company could have to repay certain loans at short
notice, since some of TeliaSonera’s financing agree-
ments contain customary change-of-control clauses.
These clauses generally also contain other conditions
including, for example, that the change of control has
to cause a negative change in TeliaSonera’s credit rat-
ing in order to be effective.

Market development

During the year, several important steps were taken
to monetize on the continued growth in data traf-

fic. In Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Lithuania, new
offerings were introduced, combining free voice and
messaging with data pricing correlated to data con-
sumption. This is a key business model to secure rev-

enue from data traffic in the long term, and will enable
further investments necessary to provide high network
quality. As competition followed suit and responded by
similar offerings, the conclusion is that these markets
are moving into a clear data-centric business model.
In addition, offerings pooling usage of data for several
mobile devices were introduced. The growth rates
for data were coming down from previously very high
levels, indicating that users are becoming increasingly
aware of data usage and more mature in their way of
using mobile data. It indicates that the era of free data
is coming to an end also in the mind of the consumer.
Price pressure continued, especially in the enter-
prise segment, while the consumer segment showed
more resilience. In particular, the public sector put
pressure on prices in tenders during the year.
A4G-enabled Iphone 5 model was released in
Sweden in October, giving additional uplift to the 4G
demand.

Total net sales

Net sales in local currencies and excluding acquisitions
and disposals were down 2.5 percent. Several markets
were hit by reductions in interconnect rates - excluding
interconnect revenue, net sales increased 1.2 percent.
In reported currency, net sales decreased 3.5 percent
to SEK 48,873 million (50,637). The negative effect of
exchange rate fluctuations was 1.0 percent. A slight
decrease by 0.2 percent of the number of subscriptions
was mainly due to a change of churn policy in Lithuania.
Billed revenues were flat (+0.0 percent).

Only Spain managed to grow the operations in terms
of net sales during the year, with much of the growth
coming from increased equipment sales. Many mar-

24

kets were negatively impacted by interconnect price
reductions, especially Sweden, Spain, Denmark and
Estonia. In the Nordics, billed revenue growth stabilized
during the year as new offerings were well received.

The number of subscriptions was 20.5 million (20.5).
Spain continued to grow, although at a lower rate than
in prior years (4.9 percent). Finland also showed an
increased number of subscriptions (3.0 percent) fol-
lowing the introduction of new competitive offerings in
the fall of 2012. Also Denmark managed to show a posi-
tive development (4.1 percent) in a continuously tough
market. Sweden on the other hand struggled to main-
tain the subscription base and ended the year slightly
below last year (-0.6 percent). ARPU fell in all markets,
mainly explained by the interconnect rate cuts.

Earnings

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, increased 0.7
percent in local currencies and excluding acquisitions
and disposals. In reported currency, EBITDA, exclud-
ing non-recurring items, declined 0.2 percent to SEK
14,689 million (14,718). The EBITDA margin increased
to 30.1 percent (29.1).

The main reason for the EBITDA margin increase
was the initiative during the year to reduce the address-
able cost base in order to secure earnings despite top
line challenges. Although all markets except Spain
were affected, the main savings were visible in Swe-
den and Finland. Equipment margin was strengthened
in Finland, Norway and Denmark, contributing to the
improvement. The EBITDA margin was also positively
affected by the interconnect rate reductions, hitting
both top line and the cost side.

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items,
was stable at SEK 10,433 million (10,429), as a result of
the EBITDA margin improvement efforts. Depreciation
increased in Sweden as 4G roll-out speed was intensi-
fied, while it declined in Norway and in Denmark, where
the network-sharing operation with Telenor is imple-
mented.

Non-recurring items amounted to SEK -1,421 million
(-6,200), mainly due to goodwill impairment charges in
the Danish operations related to the material good-
will amount originating from various acquisitions in
the beginning of the millennium, and the challenging
competitive situation in Denmark combined with rising
interest rates. Also in Lithuania, goodwill impairment
charges were recognized as a consequence of tough
market conditions and higher long-term CAPEX-to-
sales assumptions.

Market development

Fixed lines remain a core part of the portfolio and the
customer demand for fixed line solutions increases
as the demand for bandwidth boosts. At the same
time, the customer base for traditional services such
as copper-based telephone services continues to
decrease. Consumer demand for fiber is higher than

25

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2013

Board of Directors’ Report

supply in Sweden, which stands for 56 percent of
Broadband Services’ net sales, which leads to a situa-
tion where the ability to efficiently build a fiber network
is becoming increasingly important. During the year,
over 60,000 SDUs (Single Dwelling Units) were passed
in the effort to build out the fiber network in Sweden.
The ratio of accepted offers in areas of network build-
out is increasing and the process is thereby becoming
more efficient. In all markets, approximately 180,000
new homes were connected to fiber networks during
the year.

The enterprise segment remained tough also on
the Broadband Services’ side and price pressure was
evident in all key markets.

In December 2013, TeliaSonera strengthened its po-
sition in the Swedish fiber market through agreements
to acquire the communication operator Zitius Service
Delivery, as well as Quadracom Networks and the ser-
vice provider Riksnet. Closing of the transactions are
subject to regulatory approval.

Net sales

Net sales in local currencies and excluding acquisitions
and disposals decreased 3.2 percent. In reported cur-
rency, net sales decreased 6.2 percent to SEK 33,510
million (35,723). The negative effect of exchange rate
fluctuations was 0.4 percent and the negative effect of
acquisitions and disposals (related to the divestment of
the Norwegian operation NextGentTel in January) was
2.6 percent.

Subscription growth (adjusted for the divestment of
NextGentel) continued in all areas except fixed voice,
with broadband subscriptions increasing 5.4 percent,
VoIP subscriptions increasing 18.8 percent and TV sub-
scriptions increasing 8.2 percent. During the second
quarter, TeliaSonera became the second largest TV-
service provider in Sweden, surpassing 600,000 sub-
scriptions. Broadband ARPU in Sweden also increased
5.3 percent, another sign of consumer appetite for
fixed line and associated services. Meanwhile, the fixed
voice subscriptions decreased 12.4 percent, represent-
ing a fairly steady decline rate compared to last year.

Earnings

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, decreased 9.7
percent in local currencies and excluding acquisitions
and disposals. In reported currency, EBITDA, exclud-
ing non-recurring items, declined 11.1 percent to SEK
9,778 million (11,004). The EBITDA margin decreased
to 29.2 percent (30.8).

Sweden continued to lead the EBITDA decline as
the shift away from high-margin traditional products
continued. The cost reduction program to reduce the
addressable cost base, launched in the end of 2012,
continued during the year. Headcount was reduced by
1,308 employees, which helped to defend margins.

26

The restructuring measures took place throughout the
year and the full effect was not seen until the end of
2013. Only International Carrier managed to improve
EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, during the
year.

Operating income was flat at SEK 4,023 million
(4,054). However, in 2012 operating income was nega-
tively affected by the write-down of goodwill related to
NextGentTel. Operating income, excluding non-recur-
ring items, was SEK 4,970 million (6,242), in line with
the EBITDA decline.

CAPEX

CAPEX decreased to SEK 4,755 million (5,445) and
the CAPEX-to-sales ratio to 14.2 percent (15.2). Fiber
investments remained a major investment area. Com-
pared to 2012, investments decreased in IT develop-
ment as well as in fiber build-out in Finland.

Market development

The number of subscriptions in the consolidated opera-
tions grew 3.9 percent during the year, including churn-
ing out passive subscriptions in Uzbekistan in the first
quarter. Adjusted for this measure, subscription growth
was 7.7 percent. All markets except Georgia grew in
local currencies.

The market in Uzbekistan continued to show ex-
ceptional growth during 2013 in the absence of a third
operator, following the events in 2012 where the com-
petitor MTS lost its license.

27

In September 2013, TeliaSonera announced that it

for regulatory reasons had exited Nepal Satellite and
focuses on Ncell, which reduces the business risk and
complexity of TeliaSonera’s involvement in Nepal. Telia-
Sonera reached an agreement to sell back its indirect
ownership in Nepal Satellite, a regional operator in Ne-
pal, to Zhodar Investment. The transaction generated a
capital loss of SEK 389 million.

In January 2013, TeliaSonera acquired a Kazakh
company holding frequency permits in the 2.5/2.6 GHz
band, which are compatible for use with WiMAX and
other mobile data transmission technologies. Based
on the view that it will take longer than expected to
achieve full use of these frequency permits due to the
current lack of a 4G license in Kazakhstan, TeliaSonera
recognized a non-cash impairment charge of SEK 500
million in December.

Mobile data increased in importance as a net sales
driver during the year and in the fourth quarter repre-
sented 13 percent of net sales. Increased smartphone
penetration is expected to lead to continued high data-
volume growth in Eurasia.

Net sales

Net sales in local currencies and excluding acquisitions
and disposals increased 11.5 percent. In reported cur-
rency, net sales increased 3.5 percent to SEK 20,414
million (19,731). The negative effect of exchange rate
fluctuations was 8.4 percent.

In Kazakhstan, the largest market in the business
area, net sales increased 3.2 percent in local currency.
Growth in the subscription base continued, up 0.8 mil-
lion to 14.3 million, while minutes of use decreased. The
price erosion is slowing down but is still at high levels,
leading to reduced ARPU.

Nepal continued to be an important growth engine
with a 20.1 percent expansion of the subscription base
while minutes of use decreased slightly. Net sales
growth reached 27.0 percent in local currency through
increased ARPU in addition to the subscription intake.
In Azerbaijan, growth was slow at 1.0 percent in local
currency. Both the subscription base and minutes of
use decreased.

Uzbekistan showed exceptional growth with a 51.2
percent net sales growth in local currency. However,
in reported currency growth stopped at 31.6 percent
and the difficulties to repatriate cash have continued
throughout the year. The lower subscription base
compared to 2012 reflects a revised churn-out policy in
order to free up capacity.

Earnings

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, increased

17.0 percent in local currencies and excluding acquisi-
tions and disposals. Growth has been achieved while
simultaneously keeping control of the addressable cost
base, resulting in strengthened margins. The EBITDA


--- Page 26 ---

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2013

Board of Directors’ Report

margin was 52.9 percent (50.6), while the EBITDA
growth in reported currency stopped at an 8.2 percent
increase reflecting the strengthening of the Swedish
krona in relation to many of the Eurasian currencies.
Azerbaijan was negatively affected by a lost court case
regarding interconnect pricing, with a total effect of
SEK 308 million of which SEK 103 million was recorded
in EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items.

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items,
increased to SEK 13,714 million (12,340). Amortiza-
tion and depreciation was slightly lower than last year,
especially in Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Income from
associates increased due to improved operational
performance in Turkcell. Income from MegaFon was
lower due to the lower effective ownership following the
IPO in the end of 2012, but improved operational per-
formance offset a large part of the ownership-related
decline.

Non-recurring items totaled SEK - 1,204 million
(8,289), mainly related to write-downs in Kazakhstan
and Nepal. In 2012, the MegaFon structural changes
and IPO generated significant positive effects.

CAPEX

CAPEX was flat at SEK 4,712 million (4,739) and the
CAPEX-to-sales ratio decreased to 23.1 percent (24.0).
In 2013, licenses in Georgia and Nepal were renewed.
CAPEX, excluding licenses and spectrum fees, was
SEK 3,914 million (4,486) and the CAPEX-to-sales ratio
19.2 percent (22.7). Compared to last year, invest-
ments increased in Uzbekistan to meet capacity and
coverage demand in the two-player market, but de-
clined in Nepal, partly due to late equipment deliveries.

MegaFon (TeliaSonera holds 25.2 percent and consoli-
dates 27.2 percent, reported with a one-quarter lag) in
Russia reported a subscription base of 68.3 million, an
increase of 3.5 million.

TeliaSonera’s income from Russia, excluding
non-recurring items, decreased to SEK 3,093 million
(3,151), as a consequence of the lower effective owner-
ship after the IPO. The Russian ruble depreciated 4.1
percent against the Swedish krona which had a nega-
tive impact of SEK 36 million.

Dividends paid by MegaFon were SEK 1,940 million
net of taxes (11,726). In 2012, MegaFon paid one-off
dividends in conjunction with the structural changes
ahead of the IPO.

Associated companies — Turkey

Turkcell (TeliaSonera holds 38.0 percent, reported
with a one-quarter lag) in Turkey reported a subscrip-
tion base of 35.0 million, a decrease of 0.2 million. In

Legal and administrative
proceedings

In its normal course of business, TeliaSonera is involved
in a number of legal proceedings. These proceedings
primarily involve claims arising out of commercial law
issues and matters relating to telecommunications reg-
ulations and competition law. For further information,
see Note C29 to the consolidated financial statements.

Innovation, Research and
Development

Innovation, research and development (R&D) activities
are performed to ensure TeliaSonera’s leading posi-
tion in the telecom industry as well as to support future
profitable growth and cost efficiency. In 2013, Telia-
Sonera accentuated the importance of innovation and
initiated studies and pilots to strengthen the innova-
tion culture and process. Innovation activities typically
target new business models and solutions, offering
excellent customer experience by being based on deep
customer and market insight. The solutions are often
based on open standards and prepared in cooperation
with different types of partners.

The main focus is on developing the core network
access and telecommunication service solutions.

To support the core business, value-added services
are facilitated in partnership with leading brands and
players to enhance the offerings to various customer
segments. In 2013, several new partnerships have been
agreed and also one new investment in a partner. To
strengthen TeliaSonera’s market leadership, key focus
has been on world-class network quality in mobile and
fiber, mobile and fiber network enhancements, online,
value-added services and IT enhancements through
improved business and operational support systems
and processes.

The consumer portfolio is developed with new
functionality and services regarding data, digital home,
IPTV, media and applications. TeliaSonera acquired a
25 percent stake in the Estonian partner Yoga, sup-
plier of TeliaSonera’s home control solution offered in
Finland and Estonia. Business models are adapted to
new needs, exemplified by the new mobile data-centric
subscriptions that have been introduced in several
markets. To facilitate further revenues, the subscrip-
tion user interfaces and processes for value-added
services are enhanced as well as the interfaces for
integrating third-party services.

The business portfolio is developed with emphasis
on data, cloud-based services, applications and net-
based communication solutions. TeliaSonera launched
TeliaSonera CDN as an internal venture in a partner-
ship model, serving OTT traffic for media delivery and
web performance, securing a faster and more reliable
end-user experience. TeliaSonera is launching a cloud
application marketplace based on a platform from
AppDirect, where partnerships are also agreed with

30

service providers to fill the cloud marketplace for SMEs
with relevant services. Cooperation with PGi has been
established regarding cloud-based conferencing and
collaboration solutions. TeliaSonera is also working with
partners to develop the M2M (machine-to-machine)
area in the TeliaSonera M2M Partner Program and in
separate innovation projects. A new M2M platform has
been put in operation which will support innovation and
business up-scaling. More and more things are con-
nected as for example shown by the partnership with
Tesla Motors.

TeliaSonera has innovation partnerships with large
customers, for example with the Swedish city of Upp-
sala, working together on enabling innovation with third
parties including the citizens of Uppsala, and is also
looking into an innovations test-bed partnership.

As of December 31, 2013, TeliaSonera had 423
patent “families” and 2,590 patents and patent ap-
plications, none of which, individually, is material to its
business. In 2013, TeliaSonera sold some patents as
part of an effort to increase the commercialization of
the patent portfolio.

In 2013, TeliaSonera incurred R&D expenses of SEK
294 million (382).

Environment

TeliaSonera is committed to environmental respon-
sibility. The work is guided by TeliaSonera’s Code of
Ethics and Conduct which serves as an overall policy
document, also covering the majority-owned subsidiar-
ies. Annually, TeliaSonera also publicly reports on its
environmental performance in a separate Sustainability
Report.

The TeliaSonera Sustainability Report is available at:
www.teliasonera.com/Sustainability-Report

(Information on the TeliaSonera website does not form
part of this Report)

The environmental impact from TeliaSonera’s opera-

tions is mainly associated with energy utilization and

material usage. Customers demand 24/7 mobile and

internet connectivity and even if using cutting-edge

technology, the energy consumption required to

meet this demand and to run the operations currently

represent the greatest part of TeliaSonera’s calculated

carbon footprint. One permanent priority is to continu-

ously strive to find more energy-efficient solutions for

networks and data centers. With 2012 as the base year,

group common targets are to:

+ Reduce carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions by 20 per-
cent per subscription equivalent by 2020; and

+ Increase energy efficiency (measured as kWh elec-
tricity purchased in operations) by 20 percent by
2020.

The progress on the targets will be reported to Group

Management bi-annually as well as annually in the

Sustainability Report.

TeliaSonera’s operations also generate waste of
various kinds, including hazardous waste, electronic
equipment, networks devices and cables, and waste
from office premises. Technology shifts currently
represent a considerable challenge in terms of waste
management, particularly in relation to the handling of
disused poles, which contain hazardous substances,
and to the recycling of valuable copper cables.

TeliaSonera’s indirect environmental impacts include
various ways in which customers can use TeliaSonera’s
services to reduce their CO, emissions. Other indirect
environmental impacts related to TeliaSonera’s value
chain include activities such as the manufacturing of
the equipment and devices used by customers and
TeliaSonera’s own network equipment, as well as the
end-of-life treatment of these products.

As aminimum, TeliaSonera companies shall comply
with local legal requirements wherever they operate.
TeliaSonera in Sweden does not conduct any opera-
tions subject to environmental permits from authori-
ties according to the Swedish Environmental Code,
Chapter 9.

Remuneration to Executive
Management

Proposed remuneration principles for
Group Management 2014

The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting on April 2, 2014, resolves on the following
principles for remuneration to Group Management.
Group Management is defined as the President and the
other members of the Management Team.

Objective of the principles

The objective of the principles is to ensure that the
company can attract and retain the best people in order
to support the vision and strategy of the company.
Remuneration to Group Management should be built
on a total reward approach and be market relevant, but
not leading. The remuneration principles should enable
international hiring and should support diversity within
Group Management. The market comparison should
be made against a set of peer-group companies with
comparable sizes, industries and complexity. The total
reward approach should consist of fixed salary, pension
benefits, conditions for notice and severance pay and
other benefits.

Fixed salary

The fixed salary of a Group Management member
should be based on competence, responsibility and
performance. The company uses an international
evaluation system in order to evaluate the scope and
responsibility of the position. Market benchmark is
conducted on a regular basis. The individual perfor-
mance is monitored and used as a basis for annual
reviews of fixed salaries.

31

Pension

Pension and retirement benefits should be based on

a defined contribution model, which means that a
premium is paid amounting to a certain percentage of
the individual’s annual salary. When deciding the size
of the premium, the level of total remuneration should
be considered. The level of contribution should be
benchmarked and may vary due to the composition of
fixed salary and pension. The retirement age is normally
65 years of age.

Other benefits

The company provides other benefits in accordance
with market practice. A Group Management member
may be entitled to a company car, health and care pro-
visions, etc. Internationally hired Group Management
members and those who are asked to move to another
country can be offered mobility related benefits for a
limited period of time.

Notice of termination and severance pay
The termination period for a Group Management mem-
ber may be up to six months (12 months for the Presi-
dent) when given by the employee and up to twelve
months when given by the Company. In case the termi-
nation is given by the company, the individual may be
entitled to a severance payment up to twelve months.
Severance pay shall not constitute a basis for calcula-
tion of vacation pay or pension benefits. Termination
and severance pay will also be reduced if the individual
will be entitled to pay from a new employment or if the
individual will be conducting own business during the
termination period or the severance period.

The Board of Directors may make minor deviations
on an individual basis from the principles stated above.

Long-term incentive program
2013/2016

The Annual General Meeting held on April 3, 2013,
decided to launch a long-term incentive program

which includes approximately 100 key employees. This
program is not available for the members of Group
Management. A long-term incentive program should
strengthen TeliaSonera’s ability to recruit and retain
talented key employees, create a long-term confidence
in and commitment to the group’s long-term develop-
ment, strengthen the group’s efforts to be more of a
united company - “One Group”, align key employees’
interests with those of the shareholders, increase the
part of the remuneration that is linked to the company’s
performance and encourage shareholding of key em-
ployees.

The program rewards performance measured over a
minimum of a three year period, is capped to a maxi-
mum of 37.5 percent of the annual base salary and is
equity based (invested and delivered in TeliaSonera
shares with the ambition that the employees should re-
main shareholders also after vesting). A prerequisite for


--- Page 30 ---

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2013

Board of Directors’ Report

payout from such a program is the continuous employ-
ment at the end of the performance period.

The program measures performance over a 3-year
period in relation to Earnings Per Share (EPS, weight 50
percent) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR, weight 50
percent) compared to a corresponding TSR develop-
ment of a pre-defined peer-group of companies. The
program may be annually repeated. Equal programs
were launched in 2010-2012. The prevalence of a long-
term incentive program is subject to the approval of the
Annual General Meeting.

For more information on TeliaSonera’s long-term
incentive programs, see Note C31 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Corporate Governance Statement

Corporate Governance Statement

eliaSonera operates in a dynamic industry

with many challenges. At the time the current

Board of Directors was elected, the company

was facing intense scrutiny and was strongly
questioned. The Board's mission was to take the re-
quired steps to regain trust from the outside world and
to ensure sustainable operations.

In order to attain good profitability, we must secure
a long-term view of sustainability issues and build a
strong platform to meet future challenges. In 2013, the
Board’s work focused on three main areas.

One of the Board’s first actions was to initiate a
review of transactions and agreements made in Eura-
sia. The aim was to gain an understanding of the facts
and risks, and, where appropriate, take the necessary
measures to establish suitable conditions in order to
act appropriately and ethically today and in the future.
The review will be concluded during the first quarter of
2014 and to fulfil the goal of transparency, a summary
of the findings and conclusions will be presented at the
Annual General Meeting. The Board has also appointed
anew committee, the Sustainability and Ethics Com-

Introduction

This Corporate Governance Statement was adopted by
the Board of Directors at its meeting on March 5, 2014.
It was prepared according to the Swedish Corporate
Governance Code and the Swedish Annual Reports
Act and has been examined by the external auditors.
The Statement presents an overview of TeliaSonera’s
corporate governance model and includes the Board’s
description of the internal controls environment and
risk management regarding financial reporting.
TeliaSonera’s strategy means that the company
does business in some of the world’s most challeng-
ing markets when it comes to corruption and violations
of human rights. The importance of a zero tolerance
across the entire organization against corruption and
human rights abuses can therefore not be overesti-
mated. In 2013, a large part of the work of the Board
of Directors and Group Management was devoted to
strategic development issues and to sharpening the
focus on sustainability, ethics and compliance issues.
Significant new measures were implemented and an-
nounced.

33

mittee, tasked to work forward with sustainability issues
to safeguard that we are doing the right things and are
working in a Correct way.

A board’s main tasks are to ensure that there is a
functioning management team that exerts a strong and
good leadership - it’s a prerequisite for a solid corpo-
rate culture. A second key priority was therefore to start
the process of recruiting a permanent CEO. In June,
Johan Dennelind was appointed CEO and he assumed
his position on September 1.

The third area we worked intensively with is the
strategy — our future focus and long-term goals as well
as our geographical footprint. The telecommunications
industry is undergoing rapid change and our role on the
Board is to build a stronger platform to address future
challenges and opportunities in order to continue to
deliver profitable growth through sustainable business.
lam convinced that we will have an interesting year
ahead of us.

Marie Ehrling
Chair of the Board

In addition, development work in corporate governance
during 2013 included implementing risk catalogues in
all major entities in which TeliaSonera has management
responsibility in order to establish a consistent ap-
proach to and a group-common view of risks related to
incorrect financial reporting.

Compliance

It is the opinion of the Board of Directors that Telia-
Sonera has complied with the Swedish Corporate
Governance Code during 2013.

Further, there was no infringement of applicable
stock exchange rules and no breach of good practice
on the securities market reported by the NASDAQ OMX
Stockholm’s Disciplinary Committee or the Swedish
Securities Council.

ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD WORK

In addition, the Board of Directors devoted a number of
meetings to training activities, in order to get a compre-
hensive introduction to the group’s operations.

Further, the Board of Directors evaluated its internal
work during 2013 by self-assessment. The results of the
evaluation were reported to the Nomination Committee.

Review of Eurasian transactions

In connection with the Annual General Meeting on April
3, 2013, the Board of Directors announced its inten-
tion to conduct a thorough review of transactions and
agreements made in the past few years and Telia-
Sonera’s partners in Eurasia. On April 18, the Board
announced that the international law firm Norton Rose
Fulbright had been assigned to conduct the review.

The review will give the Board of Directors a clear
picture of transactions in Eurasia and a risk assessment
from a business ethical perspective. TeliaSonera’s pre-
sent processes and routines have also been analyzed
in order to assess whether they are suitable and suf-
ficient for managing the identified risks.

The review project has been performed in stages,
country by country. Assessments regarding risks for
participation in corruption and money laundering are
made under the laws of the jurisdictions involved in or
affected by the transactions. For advice on implications
under Swedish legislation, the Board assigned two
Swedish law firms.

The review project will be finalized in the first quarter
of 2014. Initially, the review project was steered by the
Sustainability and Ethics Committee. As of September
1, 2013, project governance was changed by establish-
ing a separate Steering Group. Marie Ehrling is Chair
of the Steering Group and informs the entire Board
of Directors on the progress of the project and other
relevant issues at every Board meeting or as and when
required.

Shared values — making us stronger together
TeliaSonera’s shared values — “Add value,” “Show re-
spect” and “Make it happen” — shape the way we work
every day.

Add value

We are customer focused and business minded. Inno-
vation and pioneering are important aspects of our her-
itage and culture. By collaborating in teams and across

efficiently. We take ownership, follow up and give feed-
back to ensure that we foster simple and sustainable

fair manner. We carefully protect customer privacy and
network integrity, and always act in the best interests of
our customers and our company.

a dynamic business climate where everyone contrib-
utes. We make it easy and rewarding to do business
with us, and always deliver on our promises.

Sustainability, ethics and compliance
TeliaSonera strives for sustainability throughout the
value chain, and aims to be fully accountable to the
stakeholders. The term sustainability is used as an um-
brella term covering all efforts to realize economic as
well as environmental and social sustainability through
responsible business operations.

TeliaSonera’s sustainability work involves ensuring
environmental and social sustainability along the supply
chain, taking care of the well-being of the employees,
reducing its own carbon footprint and those of the
customers, respecting human rights, complying with
ethical business practices in all markets, improving the
protection of customer privacy and protecting children
online.

In 2013, follow-up of sustainability-related risks and
opportunities as well as compliance with ethical and
sustainability-related requirements were discussed
within the Board’s newly established Sustainability and
Ethics Committee. TeliaSonera aims to ensure that the
sustainability management practices are constantly up-
dated on present and future issues and developments,
and that the stakeholders can play a proactive role. To
enforce compliance with ethical and legal requirements
an Ethics and Compliance Office was established.

The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer reports to
the CEO. The Ethics and Compliance Office is responsi-
ble for ensuring that there is a systematic and consist-
ent approach towards managing sustainability related
ethical and legal requirements, risks and opportunities.

For additional information, see section “Enterprise
Risk Management.”

Code of Ethics and Conduct
The TeliaSonera Code of Ethics and Conduct serves as
an overall policy document for guiding the behavior of
the employees. The Code defines how TeliaSonera’s
employees should interact with different stakeholders,
including customers, business partners, competitors,
co-workers, shareholders, governments and regulatory
bodies, as well as local communities wherever Telia-
Sonera operates. The policy document covers all enti-
ties in which TeliaSonera holds more than a 50 percent
ownership and is available in 21 languages.

To enforce the implementation efforts, increase
the understanding and to further ensure full compli-
ance with the Code, a related e-learning tool has been
rolled-out. The training tool focuses on anti-corruption
and human rights. Further work to expand the under-
standing of TeliaSonera’s ethical standards and values
has also been undertaken by the Ethics and Compli-
ance Office.

Policies on anti-corruption and supply chain conduct
TeliaSonera has a clear position against corruption.

The group Anti-Corruption Policy and related guiding
principles are implemented through an anti-corruption
program. The Ethics and Compliance Office is responsi-
ble for the program execution.

To ensure sustainability in the supply chain, the
TeliaSonera Supplier Code defines the conduct ex-
pected from suppliers in relation to protecting human
and labor rights, promoting occupational health and
safety, environmental management and ethical busi-
ness practices. The conduct rules are mandatory to
major suppliers. Implementation of the Supplier Code
is applicable for all entities in which TeliaSonera has
management responsibility. To implement the Sup-
plier Code, targeted training has been held by Group
Procurement specialists.

Sustainability reporting

TeliaSonera annually reports its sustainability perfor-
mance in the Sustainability Report, which is reviewed
by the external auditors. TeliaSonera applies the Global
Reporting Initiative guidelines for reporting on sus-
tainability including the telecommunications sector
supplement pilot. The report is intended to respond to
internal and external stakeholders’ interest for informa-
tion and request for increased transparency regarding
the sustainability work. Internally, TeliaSonera uses the
Sustainability Report to collect, highlight and share
information about best practices across the group.

The TeliaSonera Sustainability Report is available at:

Whistle-blower process

The Board of Directors has established a process which
enables employees and others to anonymously report
violations in accounting, reporting or internal controls,
as well as non-compliance with the TeliaSonera Code
of Ethics and Conduct and some other group policies, a

initiated to implement an external hotline to replace
the current whistle-blower system. The hotline will be
maintained by an accredited external service provider

Organization

TeliaSonera’s largest businesses are mobile operations
in the Nordics and Baltics, broadband and fixed-line
operations in the Nordics and Baltics, and mobile op-
erations in Eurasia.

In order to ensure strong leverage for profitable
growth and cross-border synergies, TeliaSonera is
organized in three international business areas. The
business areas have full profit and loss responsibilities
for their assigned businesses. The Finnish business
operation in total is also separated into one consolidat-
ed reporting area, managed in a matrix with business
areas Mobility Services and Broadband Services. A
separate sales unit for all sales to business customers
is established in Sweden and Finland.

Anew operating model effective April 1, 2014, was
announced on December 16, 2013. For additional in-
formation, see the Board of Directors’ Report, section
“Significant events in 2013.”

Business area Mobility Services

The business area comprises operations in Sweden,
Finland, Norway, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia
and Spain.

Business area Broadband Services

The business area comprises operations in Sweden,
Finland, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia (49 percent), Esto-
nia and international carrier operations.

Business area Eurasia

The business area comprises mobile operations

in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
Georgia, Moldova and Nepal. The business area also
includes TeliaSonera’s shareholdings in Russian Mega-
Fon (25 percent) and Turkish Turkcell (38 percent).

Group functions

The group functions assist the CEO in setting the
framework for the activities of the business areas and
provide the business areas with process development
support and common platforms within the areas com-
munication, finance (including M&A and procurement),
human resources, strategy and business development,
IT and legal affairs.

Delegation of obligations and authority

The CEO has issued a delegation of obligations and
authority, which defines the obligations imposed on the
heads of business areas, including the heads of sales
division Business Services and TeliaSonera Finland,
and group functions, and within which limits they may
make decisions.

Follow-up of our performance

+ Business reviews
+ Performance management

Performance follow-up is essential in order to be able
to take corrective measures and plan for the future.
Performance follow-up is performed on organizational
units as well as on an individual level.

Business reviews

The CEO sets goals for the operations based on the
decisions of the Board of Directors. To ensure per-
formance, managers have annual targets for their
respective operation. The plan for each business is
documented in annual operating plans and the follow-
up is conducted on a monthly basis, complemented
with forecasts and quarterly business review meetings
on business unit and business area levels. The business
review meetings are held as physical meetings and

43

include financial and business reviews for the report-
ing period and forecast period, risks and operations
performance metrics on network quality and customer
service levels. At the business area review meetings,
the CEO, CFO, Group Controller and selected mem-
bers of Group Management attend in addition to the
respective business area management.

The Board of Directors receives reports on opera-
tional performance on a monthly basis, and at each
regular Board meeting the group’s operational and
financial performance is presented in detail by the CEO
and the CFO. The business area heads also regularly
present their view on the business development to the
Board.

Performance management

TeliaSonera is developing a high performance com-

pany culture in order to outperform competition and

reach challenging goals. Setting individual objec-

tives linked to strategic business goals and providing

frequent feedback are crucial activities for managers

at all levels. TeliaSonera has established a group-wide

performance management model currently valid for the

five highest management levels in the organization.
The model, which aims to focus on TeliaSonera’s

business objectives and to cascade them into the dif-

ferent business areas, is designed to:

+ Help managers to set and cascade business objec-
tives

+ Review individual performance

+ Develop and reward high performance

+ Address poor performance

In TeliaSonera, performance is not only about what to
achieve but also how to achieve objectives, i.e. what
kind of competences and behaviors the employee
applies in order to reach results. A group-wide compe-
tence framework is established that outlines successful
leadership competences for different roles and levels.
The framework offers support to leaders when provid-
ing feedback to individuals on performance and on
which competences to develop. In order to establish
shared principles and expectations on competences
and behaviors, TeliaSonera’s shared values are used as
a platform for the evaluation of preferred behaviors.

TeliaSonera’s performance management process is
annual. The year starts with setting objectives and ends
with a performance evaluation. Consequence manage-
ment is applied, which means that high performance is
rewarded and poor performance addressed. Perfor-
mance has a direct impact on compensation as well as
career and development opportunities.

Enterprise Risk Management

Operating in a broad range of geographical product
and service markets in the highly competitive and
regulated telecommunications industry, TeliaSonera is
subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Telia-
Sonera has defined risk as anything that could have a
material adverse effect on the achievement of Telia-
Sonera’s goals. Risks can be threats, uncertainties or
lost opportunities relating to TeliaSonera’s current or
future operations or activities. Risks and uncertainties
related to business, ethics and sustainability as well

as shareholder issues are described in Note C34 and
financial risks in Note C26 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Integrated governance, risk
management and compliance

Three-line defense

Risk management in TeliaSonera can be illustrated as a
three-line defense being an integral part of the group’s
operational activities, business planning process and
monitoring of business performance. Risks that may
pose a threat to achieving business objectives are iden-
tified and assessed, and measures are implemented

to mitigate and monitor the identified risks. The aim is
not only to focus on risks from a negative perspective,
but also to acknowledge that successful risk manage-
ment is essential for strategy execution and sustainable
growth.

First and third-line defense roles and responsibilities
for operational risk management, internal controls as
well as assurance activities are as follows:
+ The line organization has the ownership, responsibil-
ity and accountability for assessing, controlling and
mitigating risks
The group internal audit function provides independ-
ent assurance on the risk management process and
internal controls environment
External parties, such as the external auditors and
regulatory bodies provide assurance in relation to
specific objectives and requirements, e.g. on the
information presented in the consolidated financial
statements or reported to the Swedish Financial
Supervisory Authority

Second-line defense transition in 2013

In 2013, the Risk Management Committee facilitated
and monitored the implementation of effective risk
management practices within the operations as well
as set the reporting requirements and coordinated
compliance assessments throughout the group. At the
end of 2013, the Risk Management Committee was
replaced by the Governance, Risk, Ethics and Compli-
ance (GREC) meeting.

To support line management and enable a consist-
ent risk view throughout the group, the risk manage-
ment work in 2013 was divided into three function-
based risk areas:

+ Business and Finance - Group CFO
+ Sustainability - Head of Group Communications
+ ITand Security - Group ClO

The function-based responsibility included e.g. issu-
ing guidelines regarding risk identification, mitigation,
execution as well as monitoring and reporting. The
risk areas were also responsible for reporting to the
Chief Risk Officer (CRO). In 2014, the function-based
responsibilities will be merged into the GREC meet-
ing to further facilitate an integrated risk management
process.

aware of and take steps to comply with the relevant
requirements. Compliance means conforming to both
external and internal requirements such as the appli-
cable legislation, commitments to international norms
and internal policies, instructions and guidelines. The
most significant areas are included in the ethics and
compliance programs and monitored by the Ethics and
Compliance Office.

In 2013, the following actions were taken:
Implementing risk catalogues for risks related to
financial reporting in all major entities in which Telia-
Sonera has management responsibility
A tool for bottom-up risk reporting for technology
and security-related risks were implemented
Reporting of sustainability-related risks was integrat-
ed into the business review process
The most significant areas related to ethical and
compliance risks were structured into the ethics and
compliance programs

Ethics and compliance framework

An effective ethics and compliance framework is the
primary mean to ensure awareness and management
of the critical ethical and legal risks. TeliaSonera’s Eth-
ics and Compliance Framework consists of eight com-
pliance dimensions and is built on the model described
as “effective compliance” and “adequate procedures”
set by e.g. the Society of Corporate Compliance and
Ethics, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, the UK Bribery
Act and Competition Authorities throughout Europe.

Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting

In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and
the Swedish Corporate Governance Code, the Board
of Directors is responsible for internal controls over
financial reporting. The Board continually reviews the
performance of internal controls and initiates activities
to foster continuous improvement of internal controls.

TeliaSonera’s risk management framework includes
internal controls over financial reporting, and is in line
with the renewed COSO framework for internal con-
trols. It consists of interrelated areas, which are control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, in-
formation and communication, and monitoring. To es-
tablish a consistent approach to and a group-common
view of risks related to incorrect financial reporting,
development work in 2013 included implementing risk
catalogues in all major entities in which TeliaSonera has
management responsibility.

Internal control is an integral part of TeliaSonera’s
corporate governance and enterprise risk management
which involves the Board of Directors, executive man-
agement and other employees. It is a process which
includes methods and processes to:

+ Safeguard the group's assets

+ Ensure the reliability and correctness of financial
reporting

+ Secure compliance with applicable legislation and
guidelines

+ Ensure that objectives are met and continuous im-
provement of operational efficiency

The objective for TeliaSonera’s financial reporting is to
be in line with the highest professional standards and to
be full, fair, accurate, punctual and understandable.

Control environment

The most essential parts of TeliaSonera’s control
environment are the group policies. Management at
all levels is responsible for ensuring that group poli-
cies and requirements are implemented and applied.
Group-wide controls exist and are reviewed on an an-
nual basis. The purpose of the group-wide controls is to
ensure that the organization complies with Delegation
of obligations and authority, financial policies and the
reporting framework.

Management at each business unit or group func-
tion is responsible for ensuring that:
Monthly and quarterly financial statements comply
with TeliaSonera’s accounting policies
Financial reports are delivered on time
Activities to mitigate the risks, as specified in the
group risk catalogues, have been implemented and
are performed
Required reconciliations are properly performed
Material business and financial risks are identified
and reported


--- Page 45 ---

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2013

Corporate Governance Statement

The TeliaSonera financial shared services unit supports
harmonized and standardized financial accounting pro-
cesses and controls across large wholly-owned units.

Risk assessment

TeliaSonera has a risk-based approach towards inter-
nal controls over financial reporting. As described in
section “Enterprise Risk Management,” risk manage-
ment related to financial reporting is incorporated in
the risk management framework. As such, assessment
and management of risks that may result in inaccurate
financial reporting is a natural part of the daily work. As
a baseline, the group risk catalogues are used. Risk
assessments are performed both from a top-down and
bottom-up perspective. Outcome from the risk assess-
ments are documented in the group risk catalogues.

Control activities

All business processes across TeliaSonera include
controls regarding the initiation, approval, recording
and accounting of financial transactions. Major pro-
cesses, including related risks and key controls (also IT
controls), are described and documented in a common
and structured way, based on the requirements set in
the group risk catalogues. Controls are either automat-
ed or manual and designed to ensure that necessary
actions are taken to either prevent or detect material
errors or misstatements and to safeguard the assets
of the company. Controls for the recognition, meas-
urement and disclosure of financial information are
included in the financial closing and reporting process,
including controls for IT applications used for account-
ing and reporting.

Information and communication

Instructions, guidelines and requirements regarding
accounting and reporting as well as performing internal
controls are made accessible to all relevant employees
through the use of TeliaSonera’s regular internal com-
munication channels. In recent years, staff at group
level has also significantly increased internal training
activities to ensure harmonization within important
areas such as revenue recognition, distinction between
capital and operating expenditure, etc.

Financial performance metrics in the business
operations are reported monthly and the results for all
entities are shared with all business unit managers and
their management teams. The sharing gives a good op-
portunity for benchmark and learning within the group.

TeliaSonera promotes an open, honest and trans-
parent flow of information, especially regarding the per-
formance of internal controls. Control performers are
encouraged to disclose any problems concerning their
controls in the monthly reporting, so that any problem
can be taken care of before it, possibly, causes errors
or misstatements.

Monitoring of control activities

TeliaSonera has implemented a structured process for
performance monitoring of internal controls. This pro-
cess includes all major business units, business areas
and group functions and consists of a self-assessment
of the risk mitigating activities. A risk-based compli-
ance review of key risks is carried out on behalf of
management in order to assess the quality of the self-
assessment, risk mitigation and overall internal controls
environment.

The results of the self-assessment and compliance
review are communicated to all relevant business units
and the GREC meeting as well as to the Audit Commit-
tee. The Audit Committee receives reports directly from
both external and internal auditors. The reports are
discussed and follow-up observations are made by the
Committee. Both the external and internal auditors are
represented at the Committee meetings.

At least once a year, the entire Board of Directors
meets with the external auditors, in part without the
presence of management.

Control Activities in Business
Operations

The purpose of internal controls over business opera-
tions is to monitor and support the development within
TeliaSonera’s strategic focus areas. The monitoring of
business operations performance is supported by de-
fined metrics measurements; the Six Sigma framework.
The metrics target, amongst others, customer experi-
ence, network performance and cost efficiency.

MAIN MEASURES

+Unwanted calls ratio « Network/service + Bad invoicing
+ Abandoned calls unavailability + Costs of sanctions
-Firstcall resolution  *Service and compensations
OES defect ratio
within 1 minute + Media stream
disturbance
+ Network data speed

Monthly, the Board of Directors receives a summary of
metrics measures by business unit.

Six Sigma is a systematic problem-solving meth-
odology that utilizes a broad set of statistical tools
to measure, analyze and improve a company’s op-
erational performance, practices and systems. Lean
Six Sigma focuses on identifying waste and defects
in operations by means of statistical analysis. It also
focuses on finding out and removing the root causes of
problems.

At the end of 2013, TeliaSonera had altogether more
than 60 certified Six Sigma black belts and close to 300
green belts. In 2013, 7 green belt courses were either

Group Internal Audit

The internal audit function reviews the group operations
and makes proposals aiming at improving the internal
controls environment as well as efficiency in processes
and systems. Through operational reviews, a system-
atic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the
effectiveness of governance is achieved.

The direction of the work of the internal audit func-
tion is stated in the annual audit scope. In order to
reflect the overall business objectives and risks, the
audit scope is aligned with the group’s business plan
and strategy. The audit scope determines priorities,
timing and resource allocation. It is approved by the
Audit Committee and presented to the external auditors
on an annual basis. Within the audit scope, the detailed
audit assignments are defined on a quarterly basis.
The quarterly audit assignments are discussed with the
external auditors in order to identify areas for mutual
reliance and to avoid duplicate work.

The Eurasian operations are an important part of
the audit scope, including on-site reviews with focus
on revenue assurance, processes and governance. In
2013, other focus areas were:

+ Procurement and logistics
+ IT and information security
+ Investment process and CAPEX

The Head of Group Internal Audit reports administra-
tively to the CEO and functionally to the Audit Commit-
tee. The results from each specific audit assignment
are reported to the line manager responsible for the
audited area or unit, and in addition to the relevant
function-related area manager and to the external
auditors. A summary of audit findings is reported to the
Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.

The Head of Group Internal Audit is also responsible,
together with two external members acting within the
Equality of Access Board, for overseeing developments
in relation to equal treatment of internal and external
wholesale customers in Sweden.
