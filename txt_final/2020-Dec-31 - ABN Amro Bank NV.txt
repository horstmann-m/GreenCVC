Strategy

Banking for better, for generations to come

ABN AMRO has a clear purpose: Banking for better, for
generations to come. This guides us through changes, is
the basis for how we shape and deliver on our strategy, and
encourages high performance and engagement from our
employees. Our purpose is our compass in everything we
do. Our strategic pillars - customer experience,
sustainability, and a future-proof bank — are our guiding
principles in acting on our purpose.

Throughout 2020, we continued with the execution of the
strategy announced in 2018 and carried out an extensive
strategy review to ensure we deliver on our three strategic
pillars. We also constantly assessed the impact of Covid-19
on us and our clients, and the actions required to navigate
through the crisis.

Customer experience

2020 was a year marked by Covid-19. In line with our
purpose, we supported our clients wherever possible,
improving our digital services, introducing Covid-19 support
measures, and developing new propositions to better meet
our clients’ needs.

Our strong digital backbone enabled a transition to off-
premise service within days of the Dutch government's
announcement of the first lockdown on 12 March 2020.
Throughout the year, we accelerated the roll-out of more
intuitive video banking solutions, introducing improvements
in our internet banking portal and digital channe
optimisations such as live-chat, social platforms and our
banking apps. This ensured that our clients were able to
experience the same level of service remotely that they are
accustomed to in person. Over 90% of our mortgage advice
conversations are now conducted via video banking, with a
consistently higher customer appreciation score than our
traditional face-to-face on premise advice consultation.

The relational Net Promotor Score results are included in
the respective business segments in the Business
Performance section.

On top of the support measures offered by the Dutch
government, we took action to help our clients through
Covid-19, providing around 90,000 Retail and Commercial
Banking clients with automatic deferral of interest and
principal payments.

Amid the urgency presented by Covid-19, we continued to
develop new propositions beyond traditional financial
services. For example, HROffice, our new recruitment
service for SMEs, helps entrepreneurs in the SME sector to
find suitable candidates for their vacancies. With another

new product, ‘Snel Betaald’, we offer entrepreneurs invoice
financing through an online platform, where they can be
paid within 24 hours after confirming the debtor.

Sustainability

The transition to sustainability is increasingly important

to our clients. Sustainability has been core to our purpose,
and one of our strategic pillars since 2018. We continued to
help our clients make their sustainability transition in 2020,
focusing on climate change, the circular transition and
positive social impact. Our efforts were recognised again
with a high score in S&P Global's SAM Corporate
Sustainability Assessment, putting us in the top 10% of
most sustainable banks worldwide. To reach our ambition
of being among the top 5% of most sustainable banks,

we have identified areas of improvement in, among others,
risk reporting and crisis management.

Within Retail Banking, we continued to offer a sustainability
discount on mortgages, integrated the sustainability of
houses into our advisory reports and trained 94% of our
mortgage advisors as “Sustainable Living Advisors”

We also pushed forward on our target to improve the
average energy label of our residential property portfolio
to A-C label, reaching 62% by end of the year, just shy of
our 63% target. While our target proved to be too ambitious
for 2020, the inflow of A-labels (21%, representing a 7%
increase compared to 2019) and the migrations from lower
to higher energy labels have helped close the gap.

In Private Banking, our clients’ sustainable investments
increased to EUR 26 billion during the year — well above
our target of EUR 22.5 billion, supported by an increase in
demand for sustainable contracts as well as our improved
offering of funds. An important step toward global
mitigation of climate change was also achieved this year,
when the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials
(PCAF), of which ABN AMRO is a co-founder, released

a tool to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions
linked to loans and investments. The PCAF standard is
already used by 96 financial institutions worldwide.

We contribute to the circular economy through the advice
and financing that we provide to businesses. We support
circular business initiatives — such as the Saltrex auction
platform, which finds new ways of using rejected or
damaged goods, or Schijvens Corporate Fashion, which
uses fully recycled materials to produce sustainable
corporate clothing. These are two examples of circular deals
we have financed as part of our ambition to support the
move to a circular economy.

Positive social impact is about shaping the future together
and about creating a fair and resilient society. We do our
part by contributing to financial resilience, financial inclusion
and equal opportunities. For example, as one of the largest
sponsors of field hockey in the Netherlands, we launched
the ‘Time To Catch Up’ programme, whereby every field
hockey club that we sponsor must give equal treatment and
equal roles to men and women in the sport.

Future-proof bank

For us, building a future-proof bank means creating an
efficient organisation with strong capital ratios and financial
performance, supported by talented and engaged
employees and a rigorous implementation of regulatory
requirements.

Our employees are the foundation of the bank of the future.
The continued commitment of our staff is clearly evidenced
by our recent high employee engagement score of 84%,

on target for 2020. While we still see a gap with gender
diversity targets, we also note several improvements were
achieved this year, ranging from gender neutral vacancy
texts to the establishment of a diversity academy. To enable
a future-proof bank, we have updated our data strategy
with a strong focus on further enhancing and embedding
our data management capabilities. In combination with our
IT transformation programme, which will rejuvenate our

IT landscape, our data strategy will further strengthen and
simplify our organisation and enable personalised customer
service.

The financial results for 2020 were marked by Covid-19,

but were also impacted by large exceptional client files.

The resulting return on equity (ROE) for 2020 was -0.8% and
the cost/income ratio was 66%. Excluding CIB non-core,
net profit for 2020 was EUR 1,140 million, corresponding to
an ROE of 5.4%. In order to re-establish our confirmed risk
appetite, we have tightened risk standards, especially in
CIB (including Clearing). Our capital position remained very
strong, with a fully-loaded Basel III CET1 ratio of 177% and
a Basel IV CET1 ratio above 15%.

Risk management and compliance, including the fight
against money laundering (AML), are key to our licence to
operate. We are making progress in our AML remediation
programmes and have significantly built up our capacity
to address AML topics. In 2020, the number of FTEs
committed to AML activities grew from around 2,000 to
around 3,800 FTEs. Additionally, together with four other
Dutch banks, we established the largely automated
Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL) to facilitate
the collective fight against financial crime. TMNL focuses
on identifying unusual patterns in payments traffic in
addition to our own transaction monitoring activities.

Partnerships are essential in realising our strategy and
offering the best value to our customer while remaining
efficient and flexible. In 2020, ABN AMRO and ODDO BHF
formed a strategic partnership to combine our equity
brokerage services in Benelux. The partnership will enhance
the equity capital markets, corporate broking and equity
brokerage services to both corporate and institutional
clients, creating a broader range of high-quality equity
research of over 500 stocks and an extended distribution
network of more than 600 institutional clients in Europe
and the United States.

and social impact. We are building a future-proof bank by
rigorously simplifying and centralising our operating model,
enabling us to focus on clients and work more efficiently.

We target an ROE of around 8% by 2024 when the cost

of risk is expected to have normalised, cost-savings
programmes will be completed and growth initiatives will
be delivering. We reconfirm our intention to resume payment
of dividends, sustainably, conditions permitting and taking
into account ECB recommendations. We are fully committed
to our moderate risk profile and our role as a gatekeeper

of the financial system. Our culture and licence to operate
remain clear priorities.

The Corporate & Institutional Banking review

The wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio, as announced
in August, was a first step to bring focused scale in CIB.

In line with our vision and strategic principles, we concluded
to be successful that our CIB activities needed more focus

and scale and CIB will need to reduce risk to adhere to

a moderate risk profile and will align to the bank’s overall
strategy and financial and non-financial ambitions. Hence,
our focus will be on clients in Northwest Europe and
Clearing, and we will exit all non-European corporate
banking activities, except for Clearing.

Stricter lending criteria and credit limits have been set to
contribute to a moderate risk profile. The non-core activities
consist of all non-European corporate banking activities.
Trade & Commodity Finance activities are being discontinued
completely, and Natural Resources and Transportation &
Logistics will focus on European clients only. We expect to
complete the wind-down of these non-core activities in the
next 3 to 4 years. This will affect around 800 FTEs. We are
making good progress in winding down the CIB non-core
business with loan volumes down by 45% since

30 June 2020.

Customer experience: A personal bank in the
digital age

We are a personal bank in the digital age, engraining the
customer experience. Our trusted relationships, together
with our capabilities across all client segments, allow us
© support our clients at all important financial steps in
heir lives. We offer both convenience and expertise: a full
digital self-service through end-to-end digitalisation for a
convenient daily banking experience, and tailored solutions,
based on sectorspecific, financial and sustainability
expertise enhanced with personal interaction at moments
hat matter.

Going forward, we will focus on attractive segments in

he Netherlands and Northwest Europe. In the Netherlands,
we will grow in the segments wealthy clients, affluent and
high-income clients and mid-to-large corporates, where we
everage our expertise. We will further develop our leading

/ 21

positions in mortgages and SMEs with new propositions,
aiming to achieve positive NPS scores and increase our
market share to above 20% in both segments. In Northwest
Europe, we build on our expertise in the Netherlands and
will focus on the energy, mobility and digital transitions,
aiming for a top 3 position in selected niches. We remain
open to bolt-on acquisition opportunities, especially in
private banking.

Sustainability: Core to our purpose

Sustainability has been a core element of our strategy since
2018, and is an important part of our purpose, ‘Banking for
better for generations to come’. We help our clients achieve
their transition to more sustainable business models. In the
Netherlands and Northwest Europe, we aim to be a first
choice partner in sustainability for our clients.

We aim to integrate sustainability into all our businesses
and to increase the volume of sustainable client loans and
investments from around one-fifth now, to one-third by
2024. We will also lead by example.

Future-proof bank: Enabling client focus and efficiency
We are building a future-proof bank that is digital by design.
We will significantly simplify and centralise our operating
model, freeing up time for front office staff to engage with
our clients. This means further digitising our business
processes and further reducing our product offering: by
2024, we aim to have ~90% of high volume processes
digitised end-to-end, and to achieve a ~60% reduction in
the complexity of our product portfolio. As our clients make
the shift to digital, we will continue to reduce the number
of branch offices. Our financial coaches will, of course,
continue to be available, ensuring that all our clients retain
access to banking services. We expect a further ~15%
reduction of staff by 2024, mostly from 2022 onwards.

We will reduce the impact on our staff through natural
attrition and reskilling to roles where we anticipate growth
and want to prevent shortages.

Enhancing the bank's culture and compliance

As a value-driven organisation, our decisions and behaviour
need to be in line with our purpose and strategy. We are
fully committed to our moderate risk profile and our role as
a gatekeeper of the financial system, which is why culture
and licence to operate are clear priorities for us. We place
great value on fostering a culture within the bank in which
everyone feels respected and valued. Taking ownership,
setting clear targets and being accountable are key

to strategy execution and our license to operate.

These are also essential for our commitment to deliver on
our moderate risk profile and to continue our fight against
money laundering.

Long-term value creation

In line with our purpose, our strategy is to increase long-
term value for our stakeholders, while minimising the
negative effects of our business, wherever possible.

We create value, not only as a provider of financial services,
but also as an employer and investor. Like any company,
however, our activities may also have negative effects. For
example, our actions may also increase carbon emissions
and cause damage to the environment.

Our value-creating topics

We carry out an assessment of our operating environment
every two years. This allows the bank to identify its most
important value-creating topics (VCT) from various

perspectives: social, economic, financial or environmental.
This assessment is based on input from stakeholders. We
distinguish four different groups of stakeholders: clients,
employees, investors and society. Each group's input is
asked and then weighted equally. The initial long list of VCTs
is based on a review of internal and external sources, such
as trend reports, peer analysis, ESG benchmarks, and Dutch
media reports. This list is narrowed down to the 36 most
important topics, based on their frequency of occurrence in
the source documentation.

During 2020, we repeated our materiality assessment of
value-creating topics. In separate surveys, stakeholders and
senior management were asked to prioritise the short-listed

36 issues, according to their importance for value creation.
The results were discussed and approved by the Executive
Committee. Out of the 36, we categorised nine separate
VCTs as Strategic Differentiators where we believe we can
create most value for our stakeholders and that differentiate
us from our competitors. These differentiators impact the
bank's strategy and its execution - each differentiator is
tied to one of our three strategic pillars (see the following

Sustainable Development Goals

In 2015, all United Nations Member States adopted the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a shared
ambition for peace and prosperity for people and the planet,
now and in the future. There are 17 integrated Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) at the heart of this global
partnership, with topics ranging from ending poverty and
creating lifelong learning opportunities, to human rights and
combating climate change.

In 2019, ABN AMRO signed the UN Principles for
Responsible Banking, together with 129 other international
banks. This connects the bank directly with the UN’s 2030
agenda (Sustainable Development Goals). The signatories
represent one-third of the total assets of all banks
worldwide. By signing, ABN AMRO agrees to align the
business strategy with the UN Sustainable Development
Goals and with the Paris Climate Agreement.

ABN AMRO assesses its impact mainly on three SDGs
where the bank believes it makes most impact as a provider
of financial services:

DECENT WORK AND RESPONSIBLE CLIMATE
ECONOMIC GROWTH CONSUMPTION ACTION

Ww AND PRODUCTION

SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth — “Promote
sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full
and productive employment and decent work for all.”

SDG 12: Responsible production and consumption —
“Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.”

SDG 13: Climate action — “Take urgent action to combat
climate change and its impacts.”

These focus SDGs also resonate with our strategic themes
for sustainability: social impact, the circular economy and
climate change.

In 2019, we carried out an initial baseline analysis to
measure our contribution to these goals. Our 2020
assessment shows a positive impact on SDG 8 - largely
through lending to businesses, thus supporting economic
growth during the Covid-19 crisis. During 2020, ABN AMRO
— in close cooperation with the Dutch government —
introduced a package of support measures for corporate

clients affected by the pandemic. On SDG 12 and SDG 13,
ABN AMRO'’s overall impact was negative — inevitably,
lending to business results in damage to the environment.
Our objective here is to reduce these negative impacts,
where possible — largely by increasing financing for
sustainable business.

Climate risks relevant for financial institutions
Climate change provides both opportunities and risks for us.
The main risks associated with climate change for a
financial institution are transition risk and physical risk. The
former emanates mainly from technological developments
and changes in policies and consumer preferences, while
the latter arises from the physical effects of climate change.
At the same time, climate change provides opportunities for
banks in the form of new investment possibilities and
emerging business models.

/ 24

Transition risks relate to revaluations of assets, firms and
business models due to climate change. We are a
recognised expert in sustainability and leverage this
expertise to support our clients in their own sustainability
ransition. In this way, we contribute to the broader
ransition of the economy and also mitigate the transition
risks we are facing.

The impact of physical risks on financial institutions is
complex and difficult to estimate. In the course of 2020,
we published our first efforts at estimating physical risks
for specific sectors. The scenarios and models used are
described in more detail in the Risk, funding & capital
management section. The analyses that we carry out on
this front are in place to inform strategic decision-making,
and may help in deciding what portfolios to focus on.

Analysis

ABN AMRO recorded a modest loss of EUR 45 million in
2020, while 2019 recorded a profit of EUR 2,046 million.
The decrease was largely due to significant impairments
(EUR 2,303 million versus EUR 657 million in 2019), mainly
reflecting the economic impact of Covid-19, oil price
developments, and three exceptional client files.

Return on Equity for 2020 was 0.8% negative, compared
with 10.0% in 2019, mainly as a result of record high
impairments and, to a lesser extent, lower net interest
income.

Return on Assets — was 0.04% negative in 2020 (2019:
0.49%), due to higher assets and lower returns in 2020.
Net interest income was EUR 5,863 million, compared
with EUR 6,468 million in 2019. Excluding incidentals and
divestments, net interest income declined mainly as a
result of continued pressure on deposit margins in a low
interest rate environment and lower average corporate
loan volumes due to the ongoing wind-down of the

CIB non-core portfolio.

Net fee and commission income! amounted to

EUR 1,558 million, a decrease of EUR 74 million compared
with 2019. Excluding divestments (mainly Stater), the
decrease in net fee and commission income was largely
attributable to lower credit card usage at ICS (Retail
Banking) due to Covid-19, and the wind-down of the CIB
non-core portfolio, which was partly offset by higher income
at Clearing (CIB) as market volatility was higher in 2020.

Other operating income! remained broadly stable, totalling
EUR 494 million in 2020 (2019: EUR 504 million). 2020
included a EUR 263 million book gain for the sale of our
Paris office and a EUR 96 million decline in income from
volatile items, while 2019 included a EUR 130 million book
gain for the sale of Stater.

Personnel expenses _, excluding incidentals and
divestments (mainly Stater), remained broadly flat, totalling
EUR 2,280 million in 2020. This included lower pension
costs (as agreed in the new CLA) and higher costs due

to the upscaling of AML activities and wage inflation.

Other expenses __, excluding incidentals, increased by

EUR 10 million to EUR 2,976 million in 2020, largely due
to higher regulatory levies. Costs for the upscaling of AML
activities were largely offset by cost-saving programmes.

Impairment charges! _ were significant in 2020, totalling
EUR 2,303 million (2019: EUR 657 million), mainly reflecting
the economic impact of Covid-19, oil price developments,

and three exceptional client files. The full-year impairment
charges were lower than guidance provided during 2020,
largely because the CIB non-core portfolio performed better,
and was reduced faster than expected. We still expect the
effect of Covid-19 to persist into 2021. The cost of risk
amounted to 78bps in 2020 (2019: 24bps).

Income tax expense amounted to EUR 401 million in 2020
(2019: EUR 634 million). The decrease is attributable to the
result for 2020 being lower than the result for 2019.
However, the effective tax rate increased significantly due
to an unfavourable geographical mix of pre-tax income and
pre-tax losses, as well as the fact that no full tax benefit
was recognised on the provision for the CIB non-core
wind-down, since deferred tax assets could not be
recognised on losses incurred in specific tax jurisdictions.
Furthermore, 2020 included a EUR 120 million write-off of
deferred tax assets relating to the wind-down of the CIB
non-core portfolio.

Main developments in assets compared with

increased by EUR 20.6 billion, totalling
EUR 395.6 billion at 31 December 2020, mainly driven
by higher cash and balances at central banks (TLTRO III
participation), partly offset by lower loans and advances
customers (CIB non-core wind-down).

Total assets

Cash and balances at central banks grew by

EUR 32.6 billion to EUR 60.2 billion at 31 December 2020,
largely as a result of participation in the TLTRO III facility
and, to a lesser extent, because loans and advances
customers decreased while the amounts due to customers
increased. During 2020, ABN AMRO changed its
presentation of instant payment facilities. For more
information, please refer to Note 12 Cash and balances

at central banks in the Consolidated Annual Financial
Statements.

Loans and advances customers decreased by

EUR 15.4 billion, totalling EUR 252.2 billion at

31 December 2020. The decline was largely attributable
to a decline in client loans, while loans to professional
counterparties remained broadly stable. During 2020,
ABN AMRO changed its presentation of instant payment
facilities. For more information, please refer to Note 20
Loans and advances customers in the Consolidated
Annual Financial Statements.

Client loans declined by EUR 14.8 billion to

EUR 235.5 billion at 31 December 2020. The decrease
mainly reflected a decline in corporate loans at CIB, which
was largely attributable to the ongoing wind-down of the
CIB non-core portfolio. Furthermore, there was a slight
decrease in residential mortgages, mainly as a result of
higher mortgage redemptions, and in corporate loans at
Commercial Banking, mainly due to lower demand as an
effect of Covid-19.

The table above sets out the current status of implementation
of climate-related disclosures in ABN AMRO's processes
and policies. We recognise that in the areas of climate
governance, incorporating climate factors into our strategic
process and setting actionable climate targets, we still have
work to do. Other areas, such as risk management, are
expected to further evolve in the coming years as the field
of climate risk rapidly matures.

ABN AMRO is currently in the process of further implementing
the NFRD 2019 climate guidelines and TCFD framework in
the organisation. A bank-wide programme has been started
to improve these disclosures and bring them more in line
with the guidelines. The ECB guide on climate-related and

Outcomes

Crime and integrity

We acknowledge the importance of our role as a
gatekeeper in safeguarding the financial system against
financial crime. We seek to continually improve our policies,
procedures, systems and controls; to live up to our
regulatory obligations and societal expectations; to
minimise the risk of being involved in or associated with
money laundering, the financing of terrorism, corruption or
ax evasion, and to comply with internationally agreed
economic sanctions.

n September 2019, the Dutch public prosecutor informed
ABN AMRO that it is the subject of an investigation relating
© requirements under the Dutch Act on the Prevention of
oney Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (in Dutch:
Wwit ). The scope of the investigation includes whether the
bank has complied with the Wwft in relation to having client
iles in good order, timely reporting of unusual transactions

and discontinuing relationships with clients in good time.
The timing of the completion of the investigation and the
outcome are currently uncertain. Therefore, the financial
impact of a potential fine, if any, cannot be reliably
estimated as yet. ABN AMRO is cooperating fully.

Clients and third-party integrity
Before entering into and during business relationships,
ABN AMRO carries out due diligence on its clients and third
parties such as agents, intermediaries and suppliers. We do
this using a risk-based approach, aimed at minimising the
risk of being involved in or associated with money
laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or tax evasion.

We systematically monitor the activities of our clients

and report any suspicious or unusual transactions to the
relevant authorities. Prospective and existing clients in
high-risk situations (such as those involving politically
exposed persons, adverse media, or clients in countries

or sectors with an inherently higher risk of financial crime)
undergo additional due diligence. We also consider geopolitical
actors when assessing the risks of financial crime in
relation to specific countries or sectors. Unacceptable risks
ead to the prospective client or third party in question
being rejected or, in the case of an existing client, to an exit.

n 2020, we continued executing our AML remediation
programmes throughout the bank. Our activities designed
0 strengthen the foundations and remediate gaps have
been reviewed by an independent expert and the plan has
been shared with the regulator. At present, more than
3,800 employees are fully dedicated to AML activities.
We are taking all remedial actions necessary to ensure

ull compliance with legislation, while remaining fully
committed to complying with all current and future anti-
money laundering and terrorist financing legislation

and making the required investments.

Organisational and employee integrity

All our staff members undergo pre-employment screening,
and integrity-sensitive positions require additional screening.
The Code of Conduct sets out guidance for handling day-to-
day business decisions, as well as major dilemmas. All staff
members also participate in mandatory training aimed at
learning how to recognise signs of financial crime, including
‘red flags’ of money laundering, corruption, fraud and
conflicts of interest. We have policies in place that require
employees to immediately report all actual or suspected
incidents, irregularities and breaches relating to bribery or
corruption. We encourage employees to speak up if they
become aware of risks or behaviour that are not in line with
ABN AMRO's purpose, cultural principles and strategy and,
where possible, to first discuss such suspicions with their
manager. If this is undesirable for any reason, they should
report their suspicions through the bank’s whistleblowing
channels, which are also open to external parties.

/ 32

Combating bribery and corruption

Corruption undermines fair and competitive business,
restricts international trade, reduces investor confidence,
and impacts on regional and global economic growth and
international stability. In addition to the risks that corruption
poses to the financial system, ABN AMRO itself can also
face reputational and financial risks from potentially
becoming directly exposed to or being abused for corrupt
practices. We take these risks seriously and take mitigating
measures aimed at limiting them.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, we monitor
the risks of money laundering, terrorism financing, bribery
and corruption in our organisation so as to maintain a strong
control system and to mitigate risks. These risks are
assessed as part of our Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis
(SIRA), which is based on qualitative and quantitative
information and helps us to gain insight into the inherent
and residual risks we face, as well as ensure we operate
within the bank’s risk appetite. In addition to the SIRA,

ABN AMRO continually strives to obtain data-driven insight
into integrity risks. It is our corporate social responsibility to
conduct business with integrity and without any form of
bribery or corruption. More information about ABN AMRO's
stance on corruption can be found in our anti-bribery and
corruption policy. This key compliance document is available
on our website.

Resilience to security threats

ABN AMRO's information infrastructures connect the
bank's networks to public networks. As a result, banking
processes and their supporting information systems

are inherently vulnerable, threatening the security and
availability of client data and services. We have established
a structured information security framework to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and
its associated assets at all times. This framework defines
the organisational structure, management and staff
responsibilities, and sets out security directives applying to
the bank, its vendors and third parties. The Corporate
Information Security Office (CISO) strives to ensure the
security of the bank, our clients and society by, among
other things, systematically monitoring client transactions in
order to detect fraudulent transactions. Security & Integrity
Management (SIM) monitors and reports the number of
incidents detected and the trends related to fraud, information
security and compliance breaches, while also monitoring
losses suffered by the bank's clients and the bank itself.

In addition, various departments in ABN AMRO work
closely together in virtual teams to manage and prevent the
risk of fraud, financial crime and unethical behaviour. In
order to prevent abuse of client data or violations of privacy,
for instance, we implemented a programme in 2020 to
detect any cases of staff accessing client accounts without
a valid business reason. The bank also faces a constant

threat of cybercrime. As part of its security programme,
therefore, it continuously monitors cybercrime threats and
adapts the bank’s defences wherever necessary. The
closure of ATMs at night resulted in a decrease in the
number of attacks on ATMs in 2020. However, we
subsequently observed an increase in the number of attacks
on seal bag machines. ABN AMRO, ING and Rabobank
therefore decided to also close seal bag machines at night.

The bank is keen to raise awareness among clients and
employees on how to recognise and prevent financial
crime. We also collaborate with other banks, the Financial
Intelligence Unit, the Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation
Service (FIOD) and the Dutch police in various public-private
partnerships to counter various forms of crime, including
organised crime, terrorist financing and cybercrime.

Responsible tax

Tax is an integral part of our sustainability agenda; it is our
corporate social responsibility to pay our share of taxes. We
communicate about our tax policy transparently and publish
our tax principles on our website. Our tax principles
illustrate how we fulfil our social responsibility in this area.
Our tax policy is based on these principles and provides
guidance on what we believe is responsible tax behaviour
for ABN AMRO, both regarding our own affairs and in our
dealings with clients. Our tax policy has been approved by
the Executive Committee, and tax and tax risk management
are discussed in the Audit Committee.

Tax transparency

Our tax principles and tax policy, as well as our aim to be

a good corporate citizen, support our objective to pay our
share of taxes. Measures on increased transparency and
accompanying reporting obligations have been
implemented into national law, and therefore also affect
ABN AMRO. We report taxable income in each country
we operate in, and in line with the value created in that
specific country. We also file a country-by-country report to
the Dutch tax authorities. The country-by-country report in
Note 10 of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
shows our revenue and tax expenses for each country.

We are transparent about our tax position, and transparency
is embedded in our values and standards.

We also comply with transparency rules with respect to our
clients. There are increasing legal obligations to exchange
information on our clients, of which the European Common
Reporting Standard CRS and the American Foreign Account
Tax Compliance Act (FACTA) are well-known examples.
Under these reporting obligations, information on our
clients is exchanged with the tax autorities.

This year, we executed a programme to implement the
requirements imposed by the EU Directive on Mandatory
Disclosure Rules (DAC6). These requirements relate to

/ 33

arrangements that may fall within certain hallmarks
indicating involvement in potentially aggressive cross-
border tax arrangements entered into by ABN AMRO itself
or its clients. These have to be reported to the local tax
authorities, with the aim of preventing tax avoidance. We
have made the necessary preparations to fulfil the DAC6
reporting obligations as at 1 January 2021.

Digitalisation of tax
ABN AMRO is increasingly required to exchange
information with tax authorities, based on domestic and

international regulations. These rules will extend in the
coming years from (corporate) income taxes also to VAT.
Moreover we expect increasing requirements for
automated tax filing via full data lineage including an
automated audit trail from source system to tax return,
such as the Making Tax Digital requirements in the UK.

Client tax integrity
Client tax integrity norms are based on our organisation's
values and tax risk appetite. Our moderate tax risk appetite
is part of the bank-wide appetite for a moderate risk profile,
which is an integral part of our corporate strategy. The
Dutch Central Bank (DNB) has continued to increase its

focus on client tax integrity risks. This resulted in the
publication in 2019 of the DNB Good Practices on Client Tax
Integrity, providing guidance on how to structure internal
processes so as to identify and manage risks associated
with tax integrity of clients. In 2020, ABN AMRO continued
to focus on client tax integrity as wells as to ensure that our
policies and tax principles are aligned and clear on this
issue, and we will continue to do so going forward.

ABN AMRO supports tax awareness sessions for client-
facing staff so as to ensure they remain continuously aware
of client tax integrity risks in the context of the evolving
international tax landscape.

Lastly, and as we wish to steer clear of aggressive tax
planning and tax avoidance, we want to offer products that
comply with the intention and spirit of the law and that are
commercially rather than tax-driven. This approach is also
reflected in our tax principles and tax policy, and embedded
in our product approval process.

Tax risk management

In 2020, we implemented further measures to enhance our
tax risk management. Our Tax Control Framework is subject
to ongoing enhancement so that changes in regulations and
stakeholders’ interests can be promptly implemented
whenever necessary. Tax risk is part of the bank’s risk
management cycle.

Tax integrity is part and parcel of our strategic integrity risk
assessment, which supports our risk-based approach to tax
integrity risks. Consideration of tax risks is also mandatory
when preparing a risk assessment for a product or business.

A company-wide control was implemented in 2020 to
ensure adherence to the tax policy throughout ABN AMRO.

Controls are in place and included in our Tax Control
Framework to ensure that ABN AMRO files tax returns in
good time in all the jurisdictions where we are required to
do so and that tax risks and positions are promptly
identified and reported. We are pro-actively seeking
cooperation with the tax authorities in the various
jurisdictions to align our tax obligations.

Our people

To live up to our purpose and achieve our strategic goals,
we need to have the right talent on board and to be able to
unleash the potential of our people. Being a people-centric
bank, ABN AMRO continually invests in: 1) the people
experience, 2) strategic workforce management, 3) culture
and leadership development, and 4) diversity and inclusion.

People experience

People are our most valuable asset. We need engaged people
in order to give our clients the best possible service and to
ensure we achieve our strategic ambitions. Our Employee
Engagement Survey (EES), conducted in September 2020,
had a 76% employee participation rate. Our Engagement
ndex increased to 84, which is above our target of 80. Our
Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) measures the extent
0 which colleagues promote ABN AMRO as an employer
o friends and family. This score increased from -7.95 in 2019
© +6.35 in 2020, indicating that more people now feel they
are brand ambassadors of ABN AMRO as an employer. In
hese difficult Covid-19 times, we have endeavoured to
support people as much as we can and to offer them the
best possible experience in order to be an employer of
choice, both now and in the future. We are proud, therefo
0 see that our employee engagement and experience
scores have improved, even during these challenging times
in which many employees have had to work from home.
Going forward, and learning from the current Covid-19
situation, working at ABN AMRO means even greater
autonomy and freedom in how, where and when our people
perform their work. This will enable them to achieve a
healthier work-life balance by being encouraged to focus on
the job at hand, irrespective of the time and place.

Strategic Workforce Management

The nature of work is changing rapidly and on a large scale.
This creates opportunities, but also risks and challenges. New
jobs arise, existing ones disappear and others cannot yet even
be conceived of. Strategic Workforce Management techniques
provide insight into the current and future workforce and
the critical skills that we need if we are to remain relevant
for our clients and achieve our strategic ambitions.

Reskilling and upskilling

The critical skills that we need to have, both now and in the
future, include skills in areas such as data and digital,
learning agility, and risk and compliance awareness, but also
in design and service design expertise. We therefore
determine where we have skills gaps and invest in what

is necessary to close these gaps. This means not only
investing in training, but also in reskilling and upskilling

as part of every employee's day-to-day routine.

Talent development

We continually invest in our people through coaching,
on-the-job learning, formal training (classroom and
e-learning) and mandatory courses. In this way, we enable
them to develop their knowledge and skills so as to support
them in securing long-term employability and contributing
to the execution of our strategy. We develop their
sustainability knowledge and skills at our CIRCL Academy
and structurally invest in people development journeys
through our Personalised Academy Platform. Trained skills
represent the awareness of the future social, economic and

environmental impact of decisions taken today. They also
increase people's ability to integrate sustainability into
business strategies dynamically and effectively by
introducing innovative applications and transforming these

into business assets. Our people are supported in their
personal and professional development by ongoing
dialogues with their team and coach or manager in our
modern performance management process (‘Together &
Better’). Lastly, we use our EES to measure the extent to
which they appreciate the bank's talent and development
opportunities. In 2020, their overall satisfaction with talent
and development was found to be 80% positive, an
improvement of 1 percent point compared to 2019.

Talent attraction

If we cannot develop critical skills within our organisation,
we have to find and attract people with these capabilities
from outside the organisation. This means continually
investing in being an employer of choice. We hired some
2,200 talented new employees in 2020. We were able to do
so thanks to concerted employer branding efforts, including
our sponsorship of The Next Web (Europe's biggest tech
platform), digital branding campaigns (the Darkside of
Money film on detecting financial crime and various IT
podcasts) and several talent programmes. We also focused
on skill-based recruitment and talent-pooling and on
ensuring an engaging onboarding process. These activities
combined to achieve a reduction in the lead time in our
processes, a higher quality of inflow, a better balance in
diversity and an improvement in the employee experience,
all with the ultimate aim of encouraging people to act as
ambassadors of our bank.

Culture and Leadership Development
In 2020, we continued along the path we set out in 2019 for
engaging to achieve ABN AMRO's purpose and strategy.

We believe that creating the right culture, where people
feel free and safe to speak up, give voice to their values and
discuss dilemmas, as well as developing inclusive,
collaborative and effective leaders, is crucial for creating the
people experience we want to offer. The need for this was
emphasised very clearly in 2020 by the sudden switch to
remote working that was required as a result of the
Covid-19 measures. Our efforts included developing and
making available a wide variety of tools, training and tips to
support and encourage leaders and teams to stay healthy,
committed and productive, and to speak up.

We also continued the quarterly leadership get-togethers
and regular leadership conversations, bringing together
ABN AMRO's senior and executive managers. These
meetings focused on providing and sharing insights on how
the bank is helping clients and people navigate the Covid-19
crisis and what the role of leadership can and should be.

As well as bringing the Leading for Better Leadership
programme completely online, we launched our Leading with
Impact programme. The latter, which builds on the Leading
for Better Leadership programme for ABN AMRO’s most
senior leaders, is accessible to leaders and prospective
leaders with a minimum of two years’ experience in such

a role. Its curriculum is tuned to promoting cross-business
collaboration, building relevant leadership skills and working
on translating strategic work challenges into operational
practice. By partnering with various external parties in these
leadership programmes, we ensure we bring in plenty of
outside-in views and thought leadership. As part of our

global Speak Up programme, leaders are educated on ethical
leadership and trained in how to create an environment that is
ree from barriers to do good and to do the right things right.

n 2020, we made substantial progress in our succession
management process by taking the next steps to make
sure we have the right people in the right place at the right
ime. We are also looking to ensure we have enough
alented people in-house to safeguard business continuity
by gaining more insight into our talent pipeline and becoming

better able to identify talent and unique successors deeper
in the organisation.

Diversity and inclusion

ABN AMRO views a diverse and inclusive workforce as
being of paramount importance. This enables our people to
perform optimally, yields winning ideas and initiatives, and
places us at the centre of society. For many years we have
been seeking to become an increasingly diverse and

' This is the definition of salient human rights issues set out in the UN Guiding Principles (UNGP) Reporting Framework. We report on human rights in line with this framework.

/ 35

inclusive organisation. The various initiatives taken in this
respect in 2020 included launching external and internal
mentoring programmes for women and for employees with
a bicultural background. We also held inclusion campaigns
during Pride Week in Amsterdam and Rotterdam and, in
October, over 6,500 of our employees participated in a total
of 55 workshops during the Diversity and Inclusion Week.

To increase the impact of diversity and inclusion, both
internally and externally, we have developed an integrated
and innovative strategy in collaboration with our stakeholders.
As part of this strategy, we conducted more than 40
interviews in 2020 and held various workshops with
colleagues from relevant departments, with the close
involvement of the Works Council.

In March, we signed the UN Women's Empowerment
Principles to mark our commitment to structurally integrating
the gender lens into our business strategy. In that context,
we also carried out pay gap research and launched the
Women and Assets (Vrouwen en Vermogen) campaign, as
well as an equal opportunities programme for field hockey.

Results to date show that the bank currently employs

116 colleagues with a disability, which means we have more
than achieved our target for 2020. Given that 41% of our
ExCo1 members are women, we have achieved our target
of having women in 30% of senior management positions.
However, we are behind on our 2020 gender targets, currently
28% for middle-management positions (target: 35%), and our
cultural targets, currently 3.9% for senior management
positions (target: 6%). We will therefore further intensify
our efforts to achieve these objectives over the coming year
by rolling out 50/50 gender-balanced inflow throughout the
organisation, arranging bias awareness training for all
managers and posting inclusively voiced job advertisements.

Despite these challenges, our efforts were rewarded over
the past year in the form of the Diversity in Business
Award, the Reuters D&I Leader Award (Highly Commended)
and the Ambassador Award for the Best Workplace Pride
Benchmark. The EES also showed 91% of our people
experience the bank as an inclusive environment.

Human rights

For ABN AMRO, respecting human rights is part of
responsible business practice. Through our products and
services, we directly or indirectly have an impact on the
lives of millions of people. We recognise that, in all our
roles, human rights are at risk and that we have to actively
perform human rights due diligence.

he salience assessment, we set up a Risk Register for all
he relevant human rights risks. Our management of each
salient issue is discussed in the 2020 Human Rights
Report, which has been compiled in accordance with the
UNGP Reporting Framework. We have used this report and
he framework to identify gaps in our management of the

n 2021, we will use the Risk Register to track our progress
not only on the salient issues, but also on other human right
risks identified during the assessment.

Our main areas of progress in 2020

In 2020, we updated our Human Rights Statement. This
statement is based on international guidelines and
conventions, including the OECD guidelines and the UN
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It
defines how we understand our responsibility to respect
human rights in the business we do, and also what we
expect of our clients and business partners. The 2020
statement includes an elaboration on remedial action and
the importance of human rights defenders and civic space.
As part of our human rights programme in 2020, we also

challenges and implications of such a mechanism, to test
certain options, and to gather feedback from internal
stakeholders who may be involved in such a mechanism.

Our conversations with stakeholders, such as civil society
organisations and clients, continued throughout 2020.
Through dialogue and the exchange of information we are
learning about the ways in which people’s human rights
have or could have been affected, and about our potential
involvement. In the summer of 2020, our CEO Robert
Swaak had several meetings with civil society organisations
to discuss topics including human rights and ABN AMRO’s
activities, our level of transparency in this area and our
approach towards engaging with clients.

Our material topics

As disclosed in the Strategy section, ABN AMRO
performed a new materiality assessment, which was
concluded in December 2020. However, given that the 2018
assessment was still in use during the year 2020, the 2018

Retail Banking

Business description

Retail Banking provides a full range of transparent banking
products and high-quality services to individuals with
investable assets up to EUR 500,000. We offer our products
and services under the ABN AMRO brand, and specific
products and services under other labels. Our clients have
access to a seamless omni-channel distribution network
providing a top-class digital and remote offering, and
supported by a nationwide network of 112 branches and our
Contact Centre.

Retail Banking has a strong and recognised market position

in the Netherlands. In 2020, we maintained our number
three primary bank position for retail clients (19%' of the
Dutch population). ABN AMRO captured a number two
market position in new mortgage production in 2020,
the combined market share of all ABN AMRO brands in
the Dutch mortgage market was 15%.

Business developments

Introduction

The outbreak of the coronavirus has had an immediate
impact on the financial situation of many of our clients.
ABN AMRO has therefore introduced several support
measures to help clients survive this crisis as healthily as
possible. The action we have taken has included granting
temporary relief to mortgage clients facing payment
problems. Less than 1% of mortgage clients made use of
these payment holidays, while around 98% of these clients
restarted regular payments after six months.

The continued low interest rates have also increased the
pressure on Retail Banking's traditional earning model.

In response, we lowered the threshold for negative interest
to EUR 500,000 per client, while the interest on deposits
below EUR 500,000 euros remained unchanged at 0%. In
addition, ABN AMRO decided to discontinue the Moneyou
activities in the Netherlands and Germany, except for
Moneyou's mortgage activities. This was because the low

interest rate environment prevented Moneyou from
differentiating itself in the market, while the bank as a
whole has a liquidity surplus.

As part of the strategy review, Retail Banking is focusing
on ABN AMRO’'s ambition to be a personal bank in the
digital age. Combining convenience and expertise is a key
differentiator in this respect. We provide expertise when
it matters through video banking combined with personal
interaction, with the aim of growing our client base and
market share primarily in affluent client segments. We are

' GfK online tracker, 2020

/ 40

targeting these clients with an improved investment
offering so as to grow income beyond savings. In addition
we will be broadening our intermediary offering so as to
increase our mortgage production.

Customer experience

Client centricity is at the heart of our strategy. Ongoing
digital and innovative developments require us to
continually adjust and improve our services to meet
changing client expectations. Our Net Promoter Score
(NPS) is stabilising, with a score of -11 in 2020 (2019: -10).
Our clients continue to remain positive about the remote
and digital channels that are driving our shift to digital.
Driven by the Covid-19 crisis, the use of video banking grew
rapidly during the year, accounting for 86% of consultations
with our advisors. Around 40% of our clients who used
remote video banking rated their experience as 9+ ona
10-point scale. Mobile Banking, too, is highly appreciated,
with 45% of our mobile banking users rating their
experience 9+.

The bank's duty of care is an important driver for reinventing
the customer experience. We reach out to our clients and
respond to their needs. We offer products that are fit for
purpose by improving our product approval & review
process. We proactively challenge ourselves to think
client-orientated, endorsed by culture & awareness
programmes throughout the organisation.

In 2020, we reached a milestone by proactively reaching
out to 100,000 clients with interest-only or investment
mortgages. We have dedicated teams in place to inform
these clients about their situation and to incentivise them
to move towards product conditions that better fit their
interests. Our clients highly appreciate these conversations,
as evidenced by the strong NPS score at both ABN AMRO
(24) and Florius (34).

To help clients manage their finances, ABN AMRO has
added a subscription service to its Grip app so users can
keep track of their subscriptions. This includes the option of
cancelling subscriptions quickly and free of charge. Grip, our
smart personal finance manager, is available for multi-bank
clients and currently has around 620,000 users.

Our efforts to improve our offering and services are
appreciated: ABN AMRO's mortgage label Florius was
recognised as the best Dutch mortgage provider in 2020,
winning a Gouden Lotus as well as a Gouden Spreekbuis
award. We have also redesigned the ABN AMRO

Variable interest rate complaints for consumer loans

The alternative dispute resolution body Kifid has given
rulings on contractual terms that give credit providers the
unconditional right to change the variable interest rate of
loans provided to consumers (revolving credit and mortgage
loans). In short, Kifid ruled that if the contractual term does
not specify the grounds for changing the interest rate, the
customer may expect the only relevant circumstances that
can play a role in changing the interest rate to be market
developments. As a result, the difference between the
contractual rate and the average market rate is set at the
moment the contract is entered into. From then on, the
contractual rate should follow movements of the average
market rate. In order to establish whether the credit provider
followed market developments, Kifid compares the course
of the contractual interest rate with certain average interest
rates published by Statistics Netherlands and the Dutch
Central Bank. In the event of deviations, it could lead to a
possible repayment of the difference by the credit provider.

ABN AMRO has received similar complaints from customers.
In a 15 July 2020 ruling, the Kifid Disputes Committee ruled
that ABN AMRO had to recalculate the variable interest
charged to a specific customer on a revolving credit. This
ruling was upheld in a 3 March 2021 ruling by the Kifid
Appeals Committee. ABN AMRO does not agree with the
current rulings of Kifid on this matter and therefore considers
taking several complaints cases to the civil courts. AB
AMRO has made a provision because it considers it more
likely than not that there will be outflow on the basis of
individual similar Kifid rulings until new civil case law
becomes available. For civil case law, ABN AMRO considers
it not more likely than not that there will be outflow, reason
why no provision has been accounted for.

ABN AMRO cannot give a reliable estimate of the
(potentially substantial) total financial risk of the contingent
liabilities not provided for, because it is unclear what the
exact scope of the verdict is and whether the verdict will
have a certain knock-on effect on other products.

Sustainability

We are supporting our clients in their transition to
sustainability by setting concrete goals and taking decisive
action. A large share of carbon emissions in the Netherlands
are attributable to the use of natural gas to heat homes and
to electricity. Our significant mortgage portfolio EUR 146
billion therefore plays a vital role both in the risks associated
with the physical impact of climate change (see: physical
risk analysis in Sustainability risk in Risk, funding & capital
review section) and in the opportunity to drive climate
neutrality, as stated in our Mission 2030 ambition. We are

HomeQgo to fully integrate its sustainability advice into our

approach in discussions with clients about making their
homes more sustainable. 94% of ABN AMRO's mortgage
advisors were trained as Sustainable Living Advisors,
meaning they have the expertise needed to discuss these
step-by-step plans with their clients. In addition, we offer
interest rate discounts for energy-efficient homes. Currently
21% of the overall portfolio comprises homes with an
energy-efficiency label A, an improvement compared to last
year (14%).

We also offer clients a range of sustainable propositions.
Until recently, ABN AMRO Groenbank clients could open a
green deposit account with Moneyou. Following the
discontinuation of the Moneyou activities, ABN AMRO will
start offering a new green deposit account through its own
channels during 2021. Our Green Loans subsidiary is also
helping clients to invest in home improvement measures
that will generate or save energy. In 2020, Green Loans’
outstanding loans increased by EUR 5.8 million to a total of
EUR 42.1 million.

ABN AMRO also aspires to have more social impact and is
committed to improving senior citizens’ financial
independence in a rapidly digitalising world. Our Contact
Centre has therefore introduced the ‘Senior Line’ that offers
these clients easy access to dedicated human expertise
and support.

Future-proof bank

We are continuing to focus on digitalisation and
rationalisation to build a future-proof bank. In 2020,

ABN AMRO switched to a single basic payment package —
the BasisPakket Betalen — for all retail clients. This package
includes a current account, bank card and access to online
banking. Clients can buy additional payment products such
as a credit card or a second bank card separately. In this
way they have more flexibility to select payment products
suiting their own needs and preferences.

We also aim to improve our mortgage offering by launching
a price-competitive mortgage provider through our digital
offering for target groups such as refinancers and starters,
and by driving consistency and speed across our mid-office
so as to remain a reliable partner.

Retail Banking is well on track with our AML remediation
programme. We are actively approaching our clients to
provide us with missing data. Besides joining the anti-
money laundering organisation Transaction Monitoring
Netherlands, we are also working on a new client
onboarding process to reduce the risk of money laundering.
This new flow is now available in the ABN AMRO app.

Commercial Banking

Business description

Commercial Banking is an established business partner of
the Dutch SME and corporate sector, offering asset-based
finance in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK.
We serve over 350,000 clients with annual turnover of up to
EUR 250 million in a variety of sectors. Commercial Banking
offers a broad range of products and services, based on
in-depth client and sector knowledge combined with
innovative value propositions and offerings and a digital
approach for convenience banking products.

Business developments

Introduction

The outbreak of the coronavirus had a direct impact on

the financial situation of many of our clients. We therefore
granted an automatic six-month deferral of interest and
principal payments to clients with loans up to EUR 50 million,
unless they actively opted-out from this support measure.
Given the pandemic's huge impact on clients’ operations,
many clients were very pleased to be able to make use

of this offer. In total, around 60,000 Commercial Banking
clients were granted a deferral of interest and principal
payments on business loans (including current accounts

of which balances varied during the period). We also helped
our clients navigate through the pandemic by offering
additional liquidity through government-backed loans, and
by offering advice as well as additional information and
relevant services via our platform “Doorpakken” Internally,
the pandemic accelerated the roll-out of several digital

and remote tools like video banking and digital signing.

Customer experience

We want to deliver the best customer experience by
continually improving our products and services. To do so,
we use the drivers of our Net Promoter Score and engage
with our clients so that we can better understand their
wishes and challenges, and support them where needed.
Our Net Promoter Score in 2020 was -1, remaining virtually
flat compared to +1 in 2019.

We are seeking to reinvent the customer experience by:

H Staying relevant for our clients by staying focused
on their challenges. To help our clients meet their
challenges, we intend to offer banking and non-banking
propositions called ‘Beyond Banking’. To do so, we need
to rethink our portfolio of products and services and
also establish partnerships that add value and make our
offering more innovative. Of our SME clients surveyed,
71% Say it is interesting that a bank is offering Beyond
Banking propositions. We have therefore launched a new
support platform for SMEs, called Doorpakken, which
provides a wide range of Beyond Banking services.

/ 44

Examples are bookkeeping, single invoice factoring,
cyber security, networking, HR/recruitment and carbon
footprint calculation. In 2021, we will invest in a
multi-disciplinary in-house team to further develop

this platform;

H Increasing clients’ self-reliance with regard to their
service needs. In essence, this means accelerating the
digitalisation of our most important sales and service
journeys. We are focusing on making the 25 service
journeys most frequently used by clients likeable
and digitally available. Our new, fast and convenient
onboarding journey will also be extended to allow
clients to opt for one of our three product packages and
purchase other relevant products in one go;

H Extending the opportunities for commercial clients
to interact with us in a convenient way of their choice
through video banking, live chats, digital document
exchange and digital signing. Video banking ensures
a better, more flexible and sustainable experience for
interacting with our staff and allows for personal contact
in this Covid-19 period of social distancing. Over 50% of
all client conversations are already being held via video
banking. Thanks to live chats, digital document exchange
and digital signing, we are also improving the speed and
convenience with which clients can interact with us,
while continuing to safeguard their privacy.

Sustainability

We want to help our clients accelerate their shift to
sustainability. We do this by offering suitable sustainable
products and services, embedding sustainability in our
existing products and services, engaging in sustainable
deals and partnerships, and actively educating our
employees about this topic. This expertise helps us to be
our clients’ first-choice partner for sustainability in climate
change, the circular economy and social impact.

Commercial Banking has continued to develop a sustainable
investment tool that gives clients easy insight into ways to
reduce the environmental footprint of their real estate. They
can then use this insight to undertake targeted action.

In 2020, we supported clients’ shift to sustainability by
entering into various sustainable, circular and social impact
deals, including:

H Financing a provider of electric buses for urban and rural
public transport in the European market. In this way,
ABN AMRO is helping to meet the growing demand for
electric buses and so enable the provision of reliable,
sustainable and emission-free public transport;

H Arranging a finance package for a healthcare group
to help consolidate local healthcare services and so

improve the quality and safety of emergency and other
healthcare services in the Dutch province of Drenthe;
H Signing an agreement to enable the Port of Rotterdam
to host a floating climate centre, at which a UN climate
committee will be based, for some five to ten years.
The centre will be self-supporting and energy-neutral
because, for example, water from the Maas river
will be used for cooling and heating and solar panels
will be installed on and around the building. As the
centre will be built entirely from wood panels, it will
be easy to construct and disassemble. This sustainable
project is being financed by ABN AMRO Groenbank.

Our research indicates that 83% of our clients are willing
to invest in sustainable business operations. About half
of them have concrete plans for 2021. Sustainability is an
important topic to our clients and is part of most of the
conversations we have with clients.

Thanks to the close dialogues we have with our clients
and our continued focus on offering sustainable solutions,
ABN AMRO Groenbank’s business volumes are increasing.
Despite Covid-19, Groenbank had a successful year,
doubling its volume to 234 million green certificates

and increasing its market share to 13% as part of

he government's Green Scheme.

During the year, we also launched a new initiative, Impact
ation, in the form of a national ecosystem aimed at uniting
and facilitating entrepreneurs with the practical side of making
heir companies more sustainable. The initiative involves
inking medium- and largersized companies with innovative
ech and impact companies worldwide (mainly start-ups and
scale-ups) so that, together, they can seek to solve the
challenge in a 100-day programme designed in co-creation
with The Next Web Amsterdam and the Impact Hub.

We also shared our knowledge on non-financial impact
topics with our clients, including on Energy Transition
Thursday. By sharing our knowledge of sustainable earning
models we are building engagement with clients and
raising awareness on topics relating to sustainability.

The year 2020 was a year of extensive dialogue with our
clients, as well as a year of data analytics. As climate
change can create both risks and opportunities, we started
preparing climate scenario risk analyses for our activities in
he commercial real estate, shipping, energy and mortgage
sectors. Having this dialogue and analysing the data also
resulted in a new E-learning programme, providing in-depth
nowledge for all client-facing employees.

Future-proof bank

n 2020, we continued to work to equip CB for the future
and made progress on the priorities that are essential for
becoming future-proof. We further improved CB's operational

/ 45

efficiency by investing in easy-to-use client solutions and
optimising processes and documentation. We also
implemented new ways of working in an increasingly strict
regulatory environment in order to ensure solid foundations.
This will have a positive effect on the strategy review as the
progress we have achieved has created a good basis for
urther developing our initiatives and efforts.

now Your Client (KYC) is still a high priority for us. We are
making progress in remedying our client files. We are
gradually rolling out a new identification and verification tool
hat clients can use to authenticate their identity remotely.
The first version of the digital Ultimate Beneficial Owner
ool has gone live. We are also improving the way changes
in boards and legal structures are processed. With regard

© credits, we are running a series of projects that
contribute to future-proof lending, while a substantial part
of our product portfolio has been rationalised. We have
started phasing in the use of a new customer relationship
management (CRM) platform, Microsoft Dynamics Platform
(MSD). This will help us to continue building strong, loyal
relationships with our clients. To accelerate the workforce
planning we are implementing a professional Workforce
Management system, Verint.

Covid-19 has also had an impact on how we work at
Commercial Banking. We had to adapt to the new way

of working very quickly in order to continue serving our
clients. With working from home now being the new norm,
we put a lot of effort into the engagement of our employees.
Overall, the Employee Engagement Survey showed

an engagement score of (84%), which is an improvement
compared to our score in 2019 (80%). We achieved good
progress in various areas, including the strong improvement
recorded for risk of turnover among employees and senior
management.

Private Banking

Business description

Private Banking is a leading eurozone private bank in terms
of client assets, with dedicated professionals who have
in-depth knowledge of their clients. Our international
expertise, local knowledge and over 350 years of experience
in private banking form the basis of our long-standing client
relationships. Private Banking is present in the Netherlands,
France, Germany and Belgium.

We bring personal service, digital convenience and a
proactive mentality to a full range of banking and wealth
management products and services for high net worth
clients in the Netherlands with more than EUR 500,000 in
investable assets, or more than EUR 1 million outside the
Netherlands, and for ultra-high net worth clients with more
than EUR 25 million in investable assets. Our holistic
approach provides families, entrepreneurs, institutions

and charities with expert advice that is risk-controlling,
forward-looking and sustainable, both economically

and environmentally. We are modern and enterprising,
embracing open architecture and keeping pace with
investment trends. Our digital innovations are driven by
client needs, industry advances and societal developments,
giving clients real-time wealth insights and oversight.

Business developments

Introduction

Covid-19 was the overriding theme of 2020. With various
degrees of lockdown in the countries in which we operate,
our normal ways of doing business were obviously
interrupted. Fortunately, video banking had already been
introduced in every country in which we operate, and the
exceptional circumstances greatly contributed to further
adoption of opportunities for digital meetings. Private
banking consistently and very actively reached out to clients
throughout the year, keeping them well informed about
market developments, but also seeking to connect

across client communities through online seminars and
virtual concerts and in other creative ways. ABN AMRO
MeesPierson, for example, marked its 300-year anniversary
by commissioning the contemporary artist Joseph Klibansky
to make his biggest painting ever. This canvas, measuring
over 38 square metres and entitled Beyond the Clouds, was
divided into thousands of small works of art and shared
with all ABN AMRO MeespPierson clients and employees.
While Covid-19 impacted on how we were able to interact
with clients, it did not affect what we could offer them and
our endeavours to continue improving our private bank.

/ 47

Customer experience

In 2020, we continued to work on delivering products and
services that meet our clients’ needs. We brought together
and intensified marketing, sales management and data
management to make our client offerings even more
proactive, relevant and personal. We have also mapped out
various customer journeys (such as onboarding new clients)
to identify potential pain-points and improve the experience,
thus working to combine convenience and expertise as a
key differentiator, as laid out in our strategy review. To better
meet specific client needs, we use a segmented approach
(Entrepreneurs & Enterprises, Institutions & Charities,
Professionals & Executives), including events with targeted
information and opportunities for networking with peers
and experts, in line with the focus segments defined in our
strategy review.

We give clients easy, timely access to expertise by
enabling our investment specialists to keep them abreast
of trends and developments via, for example, client portals,
newsletters and live webinars. The negative interest rate
environment and the impact of Covid-19 have led investors
to look for alternative investments. To address this, we have
introduced advice on private equity and structured products
and brokered tailored structured product deals for clients,
as well as successfully launching private equity products
such as Private Equity Coller International Partners VII (a
secondaries fund) across the Private Banking countries.

In May we announced that agreement had been reached
to transfer ABN AMRO MeesPierson's activities as
testamentary administrator, executor and authorised
representative (‘Bewind & Executele’) to Capital Support,
a specialised Family and Charity Office. This fits in with our
ambition to advise and serve clients independently and to
partner with external experts where this is beneficial for
clients. Our collaboration with Aegon Asset Management
in the Global impact equity fund is another example of

this approach.

In October 2020 we were pleased to be named the Best
Overall European Private Bank by WealthBriefing, which
referred to “an admirable focus on proactively going out to
clients and unflinchingly asking for guidance on how they
can improve to reinvent the customer experience. Strong
NPS scores and a sustainability focus also really impressed
the judges.”

The year 2020 was a challenging year for the financial
markets. Equity markets initially fell in response to the
outbreak of the virus, but rebounded strongly in the second
half of the year. As a result, most investment porfolios

ended the year close to where they had been at the start of
the year. During the year, we supported our clients through
frequent webinars and regular digital communications.

The Net Promoter Scores (NPS) for 2020 show that our
clients continue to appreciate our efforts, with the NPS
increasing significantly to +13 (from +9 in 2019).

Sustainability

ABN AMRO sees a role for private banking to support
clients towards more sustainable investment portfolios. And
not only are we experiencing a growing demand for
sustainable investments, but we also believe it is in our
clients’ interests to invest in a more sustainable manner as
this can mitigate their investment risk. As climate-related
risks can be material in investment portfolios, we measure
and report on portfolio carbon emissions. We believe it is
our responsibility to inform and advise clients on
sustainability developments in sectors and industries and
also to reflect our stance in policies and processes for
ABN AMRO Investment Solutions.

In 2020, we significantly exceeded our ambition of having
EUR 16 billion in client assets invested sustainably, reaching
EUR 26 billion by the yearend (including EUR 1 billion in
impact investments). This increase was attributable to an
almost 50% increase in sustainable contracts, the transition
from traditional to sustainable products and solutions, and

financial market effects.

To enable our clients to make more sustainable choices, we
have made a Sustainability Scan available in all Private
Banking countries. This tool gives clients insight into the
environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of
their portfolios, and our private bankers and investment
advisors are well trained to discuss the outcomes with
them. Over 1000 private bankers have participated in the
‘Oxford Fundamentals of Sustainable and Impact Investing
Programme’ delivered by Oxford University’s Said Business
School, and more than 1500 of our staff have been certified
by the PRI Academy following an on-line learning
programme. They are supported by our specialised
consultants working across countries to advise
organisations on impact and sustainability.

By making more sustainable investment products and
services available to our international client base,

ABN AMRO has been able to make sustainable investing
the default option for new clients in all countries where
Private Banking is active. In Q4 2020 we launched the
ABN AMRO Aegon Global Impact Fund, which invests in
global listed companies that align their activities with the

UN Sustainable Development Goals. Aegon Asset
Management engages, on behalf of ABN AMRO clients,
th portfolio companies on improving ESG standards and
encouraging further SDG alignment, including
commitments in the Paris Agreement. Clients now receive

w

/ 48

non-financial impact reporting so that they can track
progress in achieving societal impact, including carbon
emissions and SDG alignment. All discretionary portfolio
management and advisory clients now receive such
reporting on a quarterly basis, thus raising their awareness
of portfolios’ non-financial performance.

The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation is
expected to be implemented in March 2021. This will
acilitate the introduction of products with environmental
and social characteristics and that have sustainable
investment as an objective. We will update our policies,
based on new insights gained.

Future-proof bank

n 2020, we continued our ‘One PB’ approach aimed at
harmonising processes, services and product offerings
across private banking locations. This will enable us to
urther digitalise our services and processes, innovate
efficiently and equip clients and staff with new digital
capabilities, supporting the ambition expressed in the
strategy review to be a personal bank in the digital age.

As part of the One PB approach, first-line risk management
is being harmonised across the Private Banking countries,
including the introduction and execution of new regulations,
while we are also in the process of moving all countries to a
single platform (with the exception of the Netherlands,
which shares its platform with Retail Banking). The platform
has been live in Belgium since 2019, with the private
banking activities of Societe Generale now fully integrated,
and web and app services were made available in 2020. As
a result, clients have unlimited and secure access, at any
time, to up-to-date views of their investment portfolios.

We have started preparations for rolling out the platform in
Germany. This will be followed by France in a multi-year
programme. All the private banking entities’ websites have
been renewed and now share the same ‘look and feel’,
reflecting the One PB approach.

We are continuing to build a Private Banking culture as an
important element of our One PB ambition. Unfortunately,
Covid-19 has meant we have had to do so largely virtually.
However, our scores improved in most of the 2020 EES
categories, in line with the bank-wide results, with
significant increases being achieved in ‘vision and direction’
and ‘senior management’, the dimensions focused on in
the One PB. The score for ‘work life balance and work
pressure’, on the other hand, was slightly lower, and this
most probably reflects the impact of working from home
in the sometimes challenging circumstances caused

by Covid-19.

In previous years, Private Banking remediated its client files
and now rigorously follows the New Client Take On (NCTO),
periodic and event-driven review processes to ensure we
continue to perform our gatekeeper role satisfactorily on a
daily basis. Following the acquisition of the Societe
Generale activities in Belgium in February 2019, ABN AMRO
Belgium is in the process of remediating the related client
files, applying the ABN AMRO standards and policies.

Together with the Detecting Financial Crime department,
Private Banking is migrating towards the bank's target IT
architecture in order to support our efforts to detect
financial crime both efficiently and effectively.

Net interest income amounted to EUR 637 million in 2020
(2019: EUR 667 million). Excluding the divestment of the
Channel Islands (in 2019), net interest income largely
declined due to ongoing pressure on deposit margins and
lower deposit volumes (as an effect of charging negative
interest rates to an increased client base).

Net fee and commission income came down slightly by
EUR 7 million to EUR 502 million in 2020, impacted by
stock market developments, with a steep decline in Q2
followed by steep recovery in O4.

Other operating income amounted to EUR 286 million in
2020 (2019: EUR 50 million), largely because 2020 included
a EUR 263 million book gain on the sale of the Neuflize

Corporate & Institutional Banking

Business description

Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) has a client base
totalling more than 2,000 clients. We have a strong market
position in the Netherlands, serving clients with revenues in
excess of EUR 250 million. CIB has been leveraging on the
strong domestic franchise in selected Northwest European
countries, where it serves clients in a variety of sectors.
Globally the focus has been on three selected sectors
(Natural Resources, Transportation and Logistics, Trade

& Commodity Finance (TCF)), with a CIB presence in

14 countries or jurisdictions. CIB is sectorled and offers a
wide range of services and products in global markets and
lending. We have specialised activities in Clearing. In 2020,
the bank conducted an in-depth review of the CIB activities,
as a result of which CIB will be active only in markets
where it has scale and can be sufficiently profitable, while
CIB will further reduce risk in cyclical and historical global
sectors.

Business developments

Introduction

When announcing its results for the 2019 financial year, the
bank stated that it would be reviewing all the CIB activities
in order to improve long-term profitability and reduce the
very high cost of risk, with further elevated levels having
been reported in both Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.

On 12 August 2020, reflecting the strategic principles
underpinning the bank-wide strategy, ABN AMRO
announced the following strategic direction for CIB:
H Sectorbased relationship bank with strong domestic
ranchise;
H CIB maintains its leading market position in the
etherlands by providing a full-service offering across all
sectors;
H CIB's core activities focus on servicing clients in
orthwest Europe in selected sectors (such as financial
institutions, shipping and energy) and transition themes
energy, mobility and digital transition) with a strong
connection to the Netherlands across a focused
geographical footprint;
H The corporate banking activities in the United States,
Asia, Australia and Brazil will be wound down, while
Clearing will retain its global presence;
H TCF activities will be discontinued globally;
H Natural Resources and Transportation & Logistics will
focus on European clients only.

The wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio is well on
track, with the activities regarded as non-core expected
to have been fully wound down by 2024. We have seen
a strong decline in the portfolio, mainly in TCF Where

possible, we will accelerate the natural wind-down through
loan disposals while safeguarding value.

The Covid-19 pandemic determined the course of the global
economy in 2020 and impacted the countries in which CIB
operates. However its impact varied between sectors and
clients. And although it interrupted the normal ways of
doing business, it also accelerated the adopting of new
ways of working and interacting with clients. Client intimacy
and short communication lines proved to be especially vital
during this period. Throughout the year CIB offered support
to its clients in various ways and also provided Garantie
Ondernemingsfinanciering corona (GO-C) facilities on a
case-by-case basis.

The financial results of CIB for 2020 were marked by
Covid-19, but were also impacted by impairments in a
number of large exceptional client files. Clearing has taken
several de-risking measures following a large loss incurred
earlier in 2020.

Customer experience

CIB focuses on a strong, personalised offerings and
developing close relationships with our clients. CIB’s
business model is built on sustainable relationships
with multi-product clients. We use the drivers of our
Net Promoter Score (NPS) and continually engage with
our clients in order to better understand their wishes
and challenges, and to support them where needed.
Our NPS in 2020 was 35, up from 29 in 2019. The NPS
includes Clearing.

Reinventing the customer experience is helping CIB set
new product and service standards that are both client-
focused and data-driven, and is also raising the bar to
continually improve this experience. At CIB, reinventing

the customer experience consists of a series of initiatives,

including:

H Implementing video banking to engage with our clients
in a different way while continuing to service them as
optimally as possible in order to: i) improve the customer
experience, with our banker always being only one click
away, and ii) reduce our CO, footprint through virtual
meetings;

H Improving the customer journey through, for
example, simplified New Client Take On (NCTO) and loan
application processes. These initiatives aim to minimise
the burden on our clients and to create smoother
processes, thus enabling us to provide feedback to our
clients more quickly;

H Innovating through new business models, including
continuing to expand our Franx and Banking as a Service
(ABN AMRO Clearing Bank) platforms and our trade-
related blockchain platforms Komgo and Vakt. These
initiatives provide our clients with efficient and digital
solutions for handling complex transactions securely;

H Expanding capabilities such as improved client
dashboards and steering on NPS metrics. These tools
enable us to gain better insight into clients’ needs and to
adapt our service on a continual basis.

Sustainability

CIB aims to create long-term value for and with the bank's
clients and other stakeholders. We want to contribute to
the transition to a sustainable economy that is greenhouse
gas (GHG) emission-neutral and respectful of human
rights, and that protects our planet's life, land and water.
We are supporting our clients in their transition to more
sustainable products and business models by making use
of our data, knowledge and expertise. Our objective is to
create a positive impact through the capital we mobilise for
sustainability objectives, through the strategic dialogues we
have with our clients and through actively participating in
sustainability forums and platforms relevant to our sectors
and clients.

In 2020, for example, we deployed multiple initiatives in

support of our sustainable ambitions such as:

H Entering into green deals, for example to accelerate the
energy transition by arranging finance for a portfolio of 12
onshore wind farms in Northern Spain;

H Encouraging shipping companies to set targets
for reducing emissions by linking various ship finance
transactions to the Poseidon Principles, to which
ABN AMRO is a signatory;

H Providing support as lead arranger for one of our clients
in its first Covid-19-related Social Bond to provide funding
for investments needed to manage the effects of the
pandemic;

H Contributing to the development of ‘Blue Bonds’ by
actively participating in the UN Global Compact. These
bonds support sustainable ocean business opportunities
and make a significant contribution to the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs);

H Participating in the International Capital Market
Association (ICMA) working group developing ‘Transition
bond’ guidelines.

ABN AMRO is also committed to achieving a Paris-proof
economy by 2030. This means its financial exposure to
climate-critical sectors must be aligned with the goals of
the Paris Agreement. CIB is an active lender in sectors with
high carbon intensity, such as the energy and shipping
sectors. We conduct regular climate risk analyses to identify
potential risks, to steer the portfolio and to set specific
targets to mitigate these risks to a level that we are

/ 52

comfortable with and that is in line with our moderate risk
profile. In 2020, for example, we benchmarked our energy
portfolio against the 2 degree scenario in the Paris
Agreement and publicly shared our analysis and the insights
gained with our various stakeholders. The year 2020 was
also the first year in which we benchmarked and reported
our shipping portfolio under the Poseidon Principles. These
principles create a framework for assessing and disclosing
the climate alignment of ship finance portfolios and follow
the targets for reducing GHG emissions set by the
International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The insights
gained through this analysis will allow us to steer our
portfolio towards alignment with the IMO targets, and to
engage and team up with our clients on decarbonising the
shipping sector.

The topic of sustainability is at the top of many of our
clients’ minds. We are consequently seeing an increased
interest in financing solution products related to sustainability.
In 2020, for example, and despite the difficult circumstances
caused by Covid-19, sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) more
than doubled compared to 2019. These loans are contingent
on borrowers meeting tangible sustainability objectives,
such as an increase in the use of renewable energy, or an
increase in diversity and supplier screening, with modest
interest rate reductions offered to borrowers who achieve
measurable progress during the life of the loan. In contrast
to Green Loans, which are specifically linked to the
financing of an identified green asset, SLLs are linked to
the fulfilment of certain sustainable objectives. By entering
into an SLL, a borrower ‘financially’ commits to meeting the
sustainable objectives, and this acts as a strong signal to
internal and external stakeholders alike.

The year 2020 was also a record year for our Sustainable
Capital Markets team. This meant a very active year for
debt capital market products, through which ABN AMRO
mobilised capital and supported over EUR 10 billion

of sustainable bonds, including 24 Green Bonds, 3
sustainability bonds and a Covid-19-related Social Bond,
for a wide range of European institutions.

Lastly, and to ensure that we mobilise capital towards
sectors, clients and transactions that meet our sustainability
standards, the bank has developed a comprehensive
Sustainability Risk Policy Framework. This defines the
minimum standards for the sectors in which CIB is active,
as well as the Equator Principles for our project-related
financing. We use our Client Assessment on Sustainability
(CASY) tool to assess clients and lending transactions for
compliance with the bank's sustainability risk policies.

The outcome of the CASY tool gives us insight into clients’
sustainability performance and supports strategic dialogue
with them, and may also form the basis for setting
objectives in sustainability-linked transactions.

Future-proof bank

As part of the drive to build a future-proof bank, CIB
focused its efforts in 2020 on improving our operational
efficiency, focusing on making processes more simple and
more data-driven. We took major strides with initiatives in
areas such as IT transformation, where we aim to increase
the speed, quality and efficiency of our delivery of IT solutions
through the DevOps transformation. We also focused on
building our Data Strategy by obtaining approval in early
June for the Joint Master Plan (JMP) that enables end-to-
end orchestration and predictability of our data journey. This
plan spans all business lines, functions, grids, subsidiaries
and entities (including our international entities) and
incorporates all the existing data management-related
interventions.

The Future Credit Landscape programme was launched

0 create a future-proof credit landscape and ensure we
remain relevant for our customers. As lending represents
he majority of our operating income, it is important to
safeguard and increase this source of income, and essential
‘© operate a bank-wide strategy in this respect. This
strategy aims to create a customerdriven, digitally enabled
end-to-end credit journey and covers the bank’s entire credit
ifecycle activities. All these activities reflect our purpose to

have social impact and to positively contribute to climate
change and the circular economy.

The future-proof bank initiative also focuses on people
because we want to unleash the potential of our people
throughout their careers and fully equip them so that,
together, we can achieve our strategic objectives and
contribute to the bank's purpose. This year's activities
included the talent and succession management cycle

and the participation by multiple leaders in the Leading for
Better Programme. Meanwhile HR, Facility Management,
Digital Workplace, Procurement and Communication
continued to collaborate to shape the Future of Work in a
‘remote is the norm’ scenario. This year, we also organised
the first digital version of the Learning Week, offering more
than 150 courses based on the CIB strategic journey, the
bank-wide strategy and the three pillars. This event is one
way in which we are helping our employees to develop
new skills and ensure they remain fit for the future.

CIB's employee engagement score for 2020 was 79. This
takes account of the strategy review, with CIB core scoring
81 and CIB non-core (US, APAC and TCF) scoring 71. The
2019 score - for the full population - was 78.

The plans from 2021 onwards will build on our current
efforts, with the outcome of the strategy review being
taken into account. These plans include a streamlined
product portfolio, sourcing decisions supporting the value
proposition of customer segments and the IT transformation,
and all enabled by a strong focus on people development,
leadership and culture.

Financial review

Financial highlights

H Clear choices were made in the strategy review, with
geographical focus on the Netherlands and Northwest
Europe.

H Net interest income declined largely as a result of lower
average corporate loan volumes (mostly in CIB non-
core) and, to a lesser extent, ongoing deposit margin
pressure.

H Net fee and commission income improved mainly as
a result of higher market volatility (at Clearing), which
was partly offset by the wind-down of the CIB non-core
portfolio.

H Operating expenses in 2020 included EUR 160 million
in one-offs for the CIB non-core wind-down, of which
EUR 103 million was for personnel expenses.

H Impairment charges amounted to EUR 1,659 million in
2020 and largely included three exceptional client files
and individual stage 3 impairments, mainly in the energy-
services sector.

H ABN AMRO and ODDO BHF entered into a strategic
partnership to combine their equity brokerage services
in Benelux, strengthening their leading positions while
reducing costs.

Net interest income amounted to EUR 1,123 million in

due to the CIB non-core wind-down) and, to a lesser extent,

Other operating income amounted to EUR 32 million in
2020 (2019: EUR 132 million). The decrease was largely
attributable to negative fair market value adjustments on

Group Functions

Business description

Group Functions consists of the following main
departments: Innovation & Technology, Finance, Risk
Management, HR & Transformation, Group Audit, Strategy
& Sustainability, Legal, Corporate Office and Brand,
Marketing & Communications. The majority of Group
Functions’ costs are allocated to the business lines.

Innovation & Technology

Innovation & Technology supports the group by powering
innovation, managing group programmes (such as product
rationalisation, and driving consistency and consolidation
across customer processes) and providing services in the
areas of technology, information security, data, back-office
processing, facilities management and procurement. |&T
has a group-wide scope in both the Netherlands and
internationally. Its key deliverable is the IT Transformation,
which focuses on automation (by implementing the DevOps
way of working), optimising the workforce (by right-sourcing
and up-skilling) and reducing complexity by adopting

cloud services.

Finance

Finance enables and safeguards the execution of

ABN AMRO'’s long-term strategy. It is the primary supplier
of management and reporting information to the group's
internal and external stakeholders. Finance has a leading
role in the strategic and financial planning process. The
function has an independent role in delivering management
information and ensuring financially sound business cases
and decisions. Finance provides a strong financial control
environment and ensures compliance with relevant
accounting standards and requirements set by the
regulatory authorities. It consists of the following main
departments: Financial Accounting, Controlling, Investor
Relations, ALM, Treasury and Tax.

Risk Management

A strong, sustainable bank relies on sound risk
management. Risk Management secures a sound risk/
reward ratio by maintaining a bank-wide, moderate risk
profile as part of the bank's long-term strategy. This risk
profile is managed on the basis of an integrated risk
management framework. All identified risk events are
assessed and mapped according to risk types, sub-risk
types and overarching risks in order to provide a single,
integrated view of the risk profile of the bank and its various
businesses. Risk Management takes careful account of this
integrated risk profile and seeks to balance actions in order
to ensure that the moderate risk profile is maintained in
accordance with the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement.
The main risk types we recognise are credit risk, market

risk in the banking book, market risk in the trading book,
liquidity risk, business risk and operational (non-financial)
risk. These main risk types comprise various sub-risk types.
Risk appetite statements are set for both the main and
sub-risk types. The six main risk types cover all possible
events that directly impact the franchise value of the bank.
This includes its financial value, but also its ‘goodwill’, i.e.
he value of the bank's reputation. The Risk, funding &
capital management section of this report elaborates on

he bank's risk profile, risk taxonomy and risk appetite.

ncluded in the Risk Mangement function is Compliance.
The Compliance function is a bank-wide integrated function
hat maintains oversight of the countries in which ABN AMRO
operates. Compliance responsibilities run deep in the bank's
processes and procedures, and it is a strategic priority of
ABN AMRO to embed a strong compliance culture in the
culture of the bank and the behaviour of all staff. Effective
compliance management is an essential contributor to
protecting our integrity and reputation and supports the
bank in achieving its mission and strategic objectives.
Compliance management aims to protect the bank, its
clients and its employees against compliance risks and
behavioural risks. These can be defined as the risk of failure
‘© comply with legislation and regulations, self-regulatory
organisation standards, values and principles, and codes of
conduct, or generally accepted market standards applicable
o the bank's services and activities; the risk that actions,
decisions and behaviour by ABN AMRO or its employees
will lead to detrimental or poor outcomes for clients,
employees, society or the bank itself, and the risk that we
fail to maintain high standards of ethical behaviour and
integrity.

HR & Transformation

HR & Transformation’s primary responsibility is to support
the group by investing in an optimal people experience and
culture. HR&T makes sure we attract the right talent,

Financial review

Financial highlights

H Net interest income declined mainly as a result
of adjusted accounting estimates for amortisation o
penalty interest on mortgages and, to a lesser extent,
fewer other positive one-offs in 2020 (mainly DSB claim).

H Other operating income was lower as 2019 included a
EUR 130 million book gain for the sale of Stater.

H Operating expenses, excluding divestments (Stater),
were EUR 71 million lower than in 2019, as more costs
were charged to the commercial business lines and

cost-saving programmes were continued. The decrease
was partly offset by the upscaling of AML activities.

H ABN AMRO partnered with Techstars, a global platform
for investment and innovation, enabling ABN AMRO
to identify and support innovative start-ups that will
transform financial services, in order to accelerate

Net interest income amounted to EUR 6 million negative
in 2020 (2019: EUR 147 million). The decline was largely due
to a EUR 80 million one-off charge as a result of adjusted
accounting estimates for amortisation of penalty interest on
mortgages and, to a lesser extent, fewer other positive
one-offs in 2020 (mainly DSB claim).

Net fee and commission income declined by

EUR 29 million to EUR 31 million negative in 2020, largely
due to lower income as an effect of the sale of Stater

in Q2 2019.

Other operating income amounted to EUR 82 million

in 2020 (2019: EUR 238 million). The decrease was largely
attributable to the EUR 130 million book gain for the sale
of Stater in 2019.

Personnel expenses increased by EUR 40 million to

EUR 774 million in 2020, mainly due to the upscaling of
AML activities (largely transfer from Commercial Banking)
and, to a lesser extent, wage inflation, partly offset by lower
pension costs (new CLA) and the sale of Stater.

Other expenses! increased to EUR 727 million negative in
2020 (2019: EUR 589 million negative), largely due to more
costs being allocated to commercial business lines.

Introduction to risk, funding & capital

This section provides an introduction to the Risk, funding & capital chapter.

As!this!chapter of the Annual Report contains information based on EU IFRS

as!well!as!CRD IV/CRR, this section provides more information on differences

in!scope!and consolidation.

Contents

Risk, funding & capital management

This section sets out the bank’s approach to risk, funding
and capital management by describing strategy, policies,
governance and measurement approaches.

Risk, funding & capital review

Portfolio composition and developments are described

in the Risk, funding & capital review, which also describes
developments in the bank's main types of risk and
regulatory capital.

Additional risk, funding & capital disclosures
This section provides additional disclosures required
under current regulations.

Regulatory requirements

The Risk, funding & capital chapter presents the disclosures
required under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet
op!financieel toezicht — Wft ), title 9 book 2 of the Dutch
Civil Code and EU IFRS. ABN AMRO also embraces the
Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) principles and
recommendations. For non-financial disclosures required
under the Dutch Decree on non-financial disclosures,
ABN AMRO follows the guidance of the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial disclosures (TCFD) and the
Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NRFD) including

its guidelines.

Certain disclosures in the Risk, funding & capital chapter
are an integral part of the Consolidated Annual Financial
Statements (AFS) and contain audited information.

The audited parts concern risk disclosures of financial
instruments (IFRS 7) and capital disclosures (IAS 1).
Audited information in these sections is labelled as ‘Audited’
in the respective headings.

Risk exposure measurement and scope differences
Risk measures vary according to the purpose for which
the exposure is calculated: EU IFRS or the determination
of regulatory or economic capital (CRD IV/CRR).

EU IFRS reporting scope

EU IFRS is mainly used to measure the bank's financial
results and position by class of product. In addition, the
financial position according to EU IFRS provides a liquidity
view instead of a credit risk view. The consolidation
scope of ABN AMRO is determined in accordance with
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 11
Joint arrangements. More information can be found in
Note 1 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual
Financial Statements.

Regulatory reporting scope

The objective of regulatory reporting is to take a credit risk
view on the bank's portfolio and to ensure that the bank
maintains sufficient capital buffers for unexpected losses
and sufficient liquidity buffers. The scope of consolidation
for the purpose of calculating regulatory and economic
capital (based on the CRD IV and CRR) is generally the
same as the consolidation scope under EU IFRS and

includes subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly controlled

by ABN AMRO and active in the banking and financial

sectors. Subsidiaries consolidated under EU IFRS but active

in sectors other than banking and finance are excluded
from the regulatory scope of consolidation.

Risk, funding & capital management

This section provides an overview of the bank s approach to risk, funding and

capital management, including its risk strategies, measurement approaches and

risk!governance framework. Risk developments occurring during the reporting period

are described in the Risk, funding & capital review section.

Risk approach

Topics described in this section:
H Risk taxonomy

H Risk appetite

H Risk culture

H._ Risk governance

H_ Risk measurement

ABN AMRO remains committed to being a well-capitalised
bank with sufficient liquidity that focuses on delivering
sustainable value to all of its stakeholders. We are committed
© maintaining a sound balance between risk and reward
and to pursuing a bank-wide moderate risk profile as

part of our long-term strategy. We thoroughly evaluate the
long-term risk and return implications of our operations on
an ongoing basis. While the risk measurement, monitoring
and management processes described in this chapter proved
argely resilient, Covid-19 did reveal some shortcomings

in our risk framework. High risk costs in CIB and specific
individual client files led to tightened risk controls.
Widespread liquidity support provided by banks and
governments reduced the effectiveness of our existing risk
framework and called for specific measures to correctly
assess and classify our credit risk. For more detailed
information on our response to Covid-19, please refer to

the Update on Covid-19 in the Risk, funding & capital review
section. We also redefined our risk appetite as part of the
strategy review announced in November 2020.

We manage our risk profile by way of an integrated risk
management framework, which identifies all types of

risks and overarching risks, in order to provide a single,
integrated view on the bank and its business lines. By taking
an integrated view, we strive to carefully balance our actions
to manage our moderate risk profile. The Enterprise Risk
Management policy provides a formal approach to risk
management at an enterprise level that is aligned with

the bank's strategic objectives, including its risk profile.

The following sections describe the risk taxonomy, risk
appetite, risk culture, risk governance and risk measurement,
and how they contribute to a moderate risk profile. For more
information on the balance sheet and income statement
composition, please refer to the Risk, funding & capital
review section.

Risk taxonomy b

Our risk taxonomy classifies risks into risk types to which
the bank is, or could be, exposed. It is reviewed and
updated on an annual basis, or sooner if any new actual
or emerging risk type(s) manifest itself and requires

an update. The taxonomy ensures that all identified
material risks are defined and are taken into account in
the risk governance framework. It creates a common risk
vocabulary, provides a checklist of risk types that are used
in risk assessments, and helps to ensure that all material
risks are managed and that roles and responsibilities are
identified and defined.

The main risk types we recognise are credit risk, market
risk in the banking book, market risk in the trading book,
liquidity risk, business risk and operational (non-financial)
risk. These main risk types comprise various sub-risk types.
Risk appetite statements are set for both the main and
sub-risk types. The six main risk types cover all possible
events that directly impact on the franchise value of the
bank. This includes its financial value, but also its ‘goodwill’,
i.e. the value of the bank's reputation.

Risk appetite b

The risk appetite determines the level of risk that the bank
is willing to take in order to pursue its strategy. It is
regularly evaluated and updated to ensure alignment with
the strategy.

The bank-wide risk appetite, which is to pursue a moderate
risk profile, is an integral part of our corporate strategy.
Specific business-line risk appetites further determine the
bank-wide risk appetite. In addition, risk appetites exist at a
local and material entity level. These risk appetites allow us
to manage risk at every appropriate level within the bank,
as shown in the figure below.

Risk appetite framework

Strategic
Risk Appetite
Statement

Risk Indicator Framework

(Containing BRAS, BLRAS, LRAS,
ERAS, linked to the risk taxonomy)

The risk appetite follows the structure presented in the

risk appetite framework figure. The Strategic Risk Appetite
Statement expresses ABN AMRO's strategy of pursuing a
moderate risk profile and cascades into the risk indicator
framework at various levels of the organisation: bank-wide
(BRAS), business line (BLRAS), local (LRAS) and entity level
(ERAS). The Strategic Risk Appetite Statement is approved
by the Supervisory Board.

Senior management monitors the bank's activities, based
on the risk appetite. The status of adherence to the risk
appetite and the outlook are discussed monthly in the
Executive Board and quarterly by the Supervisory Board,
based on the Enterprise Risk Management report.

The elements of the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement
ensure a coherent balance between return and value
creation, supported by our client-centric business model,
capital, and liquidity and funding management, while
taking into account our conduct, governance and control
framework shown in the following figure. For each element,
key qualitative and/or quantitative statements are set.

The statements in the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement
are cascaded into and supported by an underlying risk
indicator framework at bank, business line, entity and local
levels. This risk indicator framework consists of statements
set for each main and sub-risk type presented in the risk
taxonomy. Each statement consists of one or more
quantitative and/or qualitative indicators, referred to as key
risk indicators (KRIs). For every KRI, a limit and checkpoint
is set, against which the actual risk profile is monitored.

If a KRI limit is breached, action is required to bring our risk
profile back within the limit. Early warning checkpoints are
in place to allow for timely action to prevent breaches and/
or to have a strategic discussion.

Examples of KRIs in our risk appetite include:

H Regulatory and internal capital ratios;

H Risk-adjusted return measures;

H Concentration limits for single counterparties,
sectors and countries;

H Economic capital and risk-weighted asset limits
for various risk types;

H Liquidity ratios (LtD, LCR, NSFR);

H Market risk parameters (NIl-at-Risk);

H Operational (non-financial) risk parameters
(effectiveness of internal control environment);

H Reputational parameters (NPS, employee engagement
score).

When setting the statement in the Strategic Risk Appetite
Statement and the statements for each risk type in the risk
indicator framework, the following aspects are considered:
the corporate strategy, market standards (such as peer
analyses), the economic environment, regulations, the
views of our stakeholders and the actual risk profile, as well
as internal insights and risk management tools. In addition

/ 63

to incorporating these views, balancing these aspects
provides us with the means to substantiate risk statements
for each risk type.

Risk culture

Strengthening our culture in the areas of risk, compliance and
integrity was an important objective of the strategy review.
ABN AMRO places strong emphasis on sound risk control
in our remuneration policies, which are in line with our risk
profile. More details are provided in the Remuneration
Report in the Leadership & Governance chapter.

ABN AMRO ensures that our employees understand

the need for and are able and willing to have a continuous
focus on risk, compliance and integrity as an integral part

of the bank-wide culture. Pursuing a moderate risk profile

is embedded in our culture by means of continuous
communication, awareness, education and training and
steered through performance management and management
KPls that help underpin our belief that mitigating risks is
everybody's responsibility.

Code of Conduct

Employees are expected to adhere to the ABN AMRO
culture principles and to act in accordance with the bank's
Code of Conduct, which sets out standards of behavior.
These principles are fundamental to everything we do and
describe how we act as a bank, how we make decisions
and how we deal with various dilemmas and, as such, are
included in our permanent education tool. The Code of
Conduct is published on our website and we are intensifying
our monitoring of compliance with it. In addition, our
employees are required to confirm their adherence to the
Code of Conduct annually. ABN AMRO's Ethics Committee,
chaired by the CEO, meets regularly to discuss moral and
ethical dilemmas within the bank and to clarify ABN AMRO’s
position, particularly in areas where policies cannot provide
definitive guidance.

Ethics committee and Speak-Up

Where norms, rules or standards are insufficiently clear or
pose a dilemma, ABN AMRO invests in moral learning and
moral decision-making. ABN AMRO’s Ethics Committee,
chaired by the CEO, discusses ethical dilemmas on a
strategic level to determine ABN AMRO’s moral position

in areas where regulations or policies do not provide clear
guidance. Throughout the organisation, moral position
sessions, dilemma dialogues and speak-up cafes are being
used to help improve ethical decision-making skills and help
determine what is right, taking into account the rights and
interests of all stakeholders. ABN AMRO has strengthened
the approachability and awareness of the various speak-up
channels, ranging from speak-up ambassadors in the
workplace to trusted persons and the whistleblowing
hotline, in order to lower the threshold for speaking up,
giving voice to values and signalling risks or possible issues.

Behavioural Risk

Behavioural Risk has been added as a non-financial risk to our
risk taxonomy. As well as helping the bank to more effectively
measure, monitor and steer on the risk that actions, decisions
and behaviours by the bank and its employees (as a group
and individually) lead to detrimental or poor outcomes for
clients, society, stakeholders or the bank itself, this addition
helps to maintain high standards of market behaviour

and integrity. ABN AMRO's approach to behavioural risk
management assesses the presence of risks that could

ead to undesirable behaviour (behavioural risk assessment)
and seeks to enable and promote desired behaviour

hrough effective change measures (behavioural change).

Risk governance b

The Executive Board, Executive Committee and Supervisory
Board of ABN AMRO define the governance arrangements
designed to ensure effective and prudent management of
he bank and oversee their implementation. They are
accountable for setting, approving and overseeing the
implementation of the bank’s enterprise risk management
ramework, including:

H an adequate and effective internal governance and

internal control framework. This includes a clear
organisational structure and well-functioning independent
internal control functions (Risk Management, Compliance
and Group Audit) that have sufficient authority, stature
and resources to perform their functions;
H the three lines of defence model at all levels of the bank;
H arisk culture that addresses risk awareness and risk-taking
behaviour in the bank;
H key policies of the bank within the applicable legal
and regulatory framework;
H the bank's overall strategy, risk strategy and risk appetite;
H the amounts, types and distribution of internal capital
and regulatory capital needed to ensure that the risks

hat the Bank is exposed to are adequately covered;
H targets for the bank's liquidity and funding management.

The Risk Management organisation operates under the direct
responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer, who is a member
of the Executive Board.

Executive risk committees

The Executive Board is accountable for a balanced
assessment of the bank's commercial interests and the
risks to be taken within the boundaries of the risk appetite.
In the risk decision-making framework, the Executive Board
is supported by three executive risk committees: the Group
Risk Committee, the Group Central Credit Committee and
the Group Regulatory Committee, each of which is chaired
by the Chief Risk Officer. The mandates of the executive
risk committees are summarised below

/ 64

Group Risk Committee

The Group Risk Committee (GRC) is mandated by the
Executive Board to monitor, assess and manage the

bank's risk profile within the approved risk appetite.

GRC monitors and approves all material risks as defined

in the Risk Taxonomy of the Bank. The GRC has delegated
specific approval powers to sub-committees, including
Business Risk Committees for the bank's main business lines,
the Financial Crime Risk Committee, the Methodology
Acceptance Group, the Scenario and Stress Testing
Committee, and the Impairment and Provisioning Committee.

Group Central Credit Committee

The Group Central Credit Committee (CCC) is mandated by
the Executive Board to make decisions on the acceptance
of credit and counterparty risk in respect of individual
persons, legal persons and public administrative bodies
relating to credit proposals falling within the scope of the
risk appetite and limits determined by the Executive Board.
In addition, the CCC is also responsible for approving

and monitoring large intercompany credit facilities.

Group Regulatory Committee
The Group Regulatory Committee is mandated by the
Executive Board to ensure a good understanding and
adequate overview, making choices and taking decisions
on matters relating to timely regulatory compliance to
new and changing national and international legislation
and regulations affecting the bank.

Three lines of defence
The three lines of defence model aims to clarify the
relationship between risk takers and the different internal
control functions, and provide clarity for all employees
within the bank with regards to their risk management
responsibilities. The three lines of defence model must be
applied across all risk types and covers the whole
organisation, including the Executive Board, Executive
Committee and Supervisory Board, the customerfacing
business lines, functions, the Risk Management
organisation, outsourced activities and distribution channels.
H The first line of defence consists of management within
each business or function who must own and is
responsible for managing the risks they incur in
conducting their activities and for the design
and execution of effective and efficient controls.

H The second line of defence consists of dedicated
departments in the Risk Management organisation who
are responsible for setting the risk management framework
within which the first line must operate. These dedicated
departments are headed by risk type owners.

H The third line of defence consists of Group Audit,
which evaluates the effectiveness of the governance,
risk management and control processes in order
to strengthen management's solution focus and
accountability. Group Audit has a coordinating role
towards the external auditor and the supervisor.

Risk measurement

We develop and use internal models to quantify the risk for
most risk types in the risk taxonomy. The models for credit,
operational, market, liquidity and business risk are the most
widely used and allow for measuring the level of risk. They
support day-to-day decision-making, as well as periodic
monitoring and reporting on developments in the bank’s
portfolios and activities. In most cases, models quantify the
probability and severity of an event, i.e. the likelihood that
an event will occur and the loss the bank may suffer as a
consequence of that event. This information serves as the
basis for ABN AMRO’s internal measures of risk (economic
capital) and as key input for calculating the minimum
regulatory capital requirements according to the Basel
framework (regulatory capital).

New models require approval before being implemented
and used. Internal approval for the use (or continued use)

of a model is obtained from the Methodology Acceptance
Group (MAG), a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee.
When required, external approval is obtained from

the regulator.

The modelling departments develop models in close
cooperation with the relevant business and risk experts.
In principle, we review models at least every three years,
or earlier if there is a marked deterioration in performance
of the model or a marked change in the risk profile of

the portfolio to which the model relates. A model review
includes back-testing against historical data and, where
relevant, benchmarking the calibration of the models with
external studies.

The independent model risk management department
validates internal models. The model risk management
framework, which includes model validation standards

and procedures, ensures that models are validated
independently. Model data, methodology, performance and

on remediation and monitoring
follow-up

implementation are checked according to these standards
and reviewed against internal and regulatory requirements.

Capital measurement

Regulatory capital (CRD IV/CRR) b

Under the Basel framework as implemented in European
legislation (CRD IV and CRR), banks are required to hold
capital to cover financial risks. As an intermediate step in
determining the minimum level of capital, banks need to
calculate risk-weighted assets (RWA) for three major risk
ypes (credit, operational and market risk). The outcome
of the internal models are an input in this calculation. The
capital requirements are stated as a percentage of RWA.
Under Pillar 1, banks are required to hold a regulatory fixed
percentage of RWA in capital. Under Pillar 2, supervisors
impose a bank-specific percentage of RWA in addition

0 the Pillar 1 requirement.

Economic capital

n addition to regulatory required capital, for Pillar 2 we
calculate economic capital (EC). Economic capital covers all
risk types in our risk taxonomy for which capital is deemed
0 be the mitigating instrument to cover unexpected losses,
and is used as the key metric for internal risk measurement
and management. It is the amount of capital we reserve in
order to achieve a sufficient level of protection against large
unexpected losses that could result from extreme market
conditions or events.

nternal models are used to calculate EC at a 99.95%
confidence level and a one-year time horizon. This implies
hat the estimated capital figure for the coming year is
sufficient to cover a level of loss that will be exceeded in
only 0.05% of all possible cases. The confidence level is
inked to the bank's target credit rating and aligned with

he definition of total available financial resources (total AFR).
n addition, the ratio of core AFR versus EC is monitored.
Core AFR is the amount of capital that is available to cover

losses on a continuity-based approach (i.e. excluding AT1,
Tier 2 and Senior Non-Preferred instruments).

EC is aggregated for all risk types (without applying
interrisk diversification) to determine the total EC at a bank
level and to support capital adequacy assessment, capital
allocation, expost performance measurement and risk
appetite setting, such as industry concentration risk limits.

EC quality assessment

The EC models described above form the core of the
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In
order to monitor and secure the quality of the EC
framework and its outcome in terms of capital adequacy, an
EC Quality Assessment (ECQA) is performed annually as
part of the ICAAP For each main risk type, the calculated
EC figure is evaluated in terms of risk coverage and
responsiveness to internal and external developments such
as in the areas of regulation and data quality. If considered
necessary, an additional capital buffer (‘EC add-on’) is taken
to cover any identified shortfalls in the EC.

RWA and EC are also used to evaluate capital performance
at a business level, as well as at transactional level in
loan-pricing tools. These tools act as a decision-making
mechanism for assessing the profitability of a new or
existing transaction. Both exante and expost performance
are evaluated in terms of risk-adjusted return on equity
(RAROE) with a risk-adjusted return on risk-adjusted capital
(RARORAC) limit to safeguard sufficient risk-sensitivity. EC
is used as an ingredient in RARORAC, whereas RWA is
used in RAROE.

Stress testing and scenario analysis b

ABN AMRO uses stress testing and scenario analysis
as an important risk management instrument, looking
at profitability, capital and liquidity from a bank-wide
perspective in various scenarios on a regular basis.

In addition, sub- portfolio and risk type-specific stress
testing and scenario analysis are performed.

Stress testing purposes

ABN AMRO applies stress testing and scenario analyses

for several purposes, including:

H Business planning: various macroeconomic scenarios
for budget purposes;

H Capital planning: stress testing is used to gain insight
into the resilience of our capital under adverse changes
in the economic environment and ABN AMRO-specific
circumstances;

H Risk appetite setting and monitoring: the outcome of
stress testing is used for setting and monitoring risk
appetite limits and targets, including limits under stress;

H Contingency planning: stress testing is used to assess
and strengthen the triggers and measures in the liquidity

/ 66

and capital contingency and recovery plans. Reverse
stress testing is performed to gain deeper insight into
plausible events that could put the continuity of

ABN AMRO under pressure;

H Risk type-specific and business line stress testing, such
as market risk trading and banking book and mortgage
stress testing;

H Supervisory stress testing, based on prescribed scenarios
and assumptions. This includes the EBAs stress test
programme designed to assess banks’ resilience to
adverse economic or financial developments.

The stress testing and scenario analysis cycle starts with
the identification of material risks for ABN AMRO and
individual business lines. Both systemic risks (e.g.
macroeconomic risks) and ABN AMRO-specific risks (e.g.
cyber attacks or adverse outcomes in legal proceedings) are
considered. Scenario projections are based on quantitative
models, as well as expert opinion procedures. In general,
results are presented excluding and including potential
mitigating actions, taking into account contingency plans.

Given the importance of stress testing in terms of sound
risk management, the Executive Committee is involved
throughout the process and its governance. The Executive
Committee, together with the Scenario & Stress Test
Committee (SSC, a sub-committee of the Group Risk
Committee), discusses and decides on the scenario
selection, the results and the implications.

Credit risk is the risk that the value and/or the earnings
of the bank decline due to uncertainty in a counterparty’s
ability or willingness to repay a loan or meet the terms
of a contractual obligation.

Credit risk management is the responsibility of the first
and second lines of defence. The primary responsibility
for intake, managing and monitoring credit risk lies with
the business as the first line of defence. The second line
of defence has a permanent and ongoing responsibility

to define the boundaries and monitor whether the type

and level of credit risk exposures are within the limits of the
business lines’ risk appetite. Credit risk management within
the bank is governed by the bank-wide central credit risk
policy and further detailed in underlying specific credit risk
policies and standards.

Credit risk management approach b

ABN AMRO employs two separate approaches to managing
credit risk. These reflect the bank’s way of doing business.
For customised lending to counterparties (non-programme
lending), risks are assessed on an individual basis.
Standardised products and processes are managed on a
pooled basis (programme lending), to which uniform risk
criteria are assigned. Effectively, any lending not specifically
defined as programme lending is defined as non-
programme lending.

Planning

Within programme lending, the credit cycle starts with a
product planning phase, during which period the product is
designed and/or reviewed. The goal of which is to optimise
the key drivers of risk and return within the context of
ABN AMRO's strategy, risk appetite, the client's best
interests and sustainability.

Credit acceptance

For a credit approval decision within programme lending,
client-specific aspects and internal and external data

are taken into consideration to calculate a credit score
(scorecard). The credit decision is based on the outcome
of the scorecard and policy rules.

Within non-programme lending, the credit acceptance
phase of a credit proposal starts with an assessment of
the proposal by the relevant business line. The qualitative
and quantitative details of the credit risk associated with
the loan are assessed prior to approval. Information must
be provided on matters such as the purpose, details and
structure of the proposed credit facility, the borrower
and other counterparties, the industry and geography,
management and owners, and financial and non-financial
analyses. Compliance with internal policies is checked.
After the assessment, an analysis is performed by Risk
Management. The credit decision is based on independent
assessments by both the commercial and the credit

risk functions.

Credit risk monitoring

Consistent and regular monitoring of the counterparty,
exposures, risk mitigants and ongoing compliance with
internal policies helps to safeguard the bank’s position in
relation to all risks associated with the counterparty, credit
type or portfolio. Monitoring starts when the credit facility
is granted and continues throughout the lifecycle of the
credit facility and the relationship with the counterparty
until such time as the exposure is repaid and/or the limit is
cancelled. During 2020, individual credit risk assessments
were intensified to monitor the impact of Covid-19 and the
ow oil price environment on clients and to make sure that
ending the payment holiday would not have unforeseen
inancial difficulties.

f a situation arises in which an individual counterparty
shows signs of credit risk deterioration, but is not in default,
a ‘watch’ status is assigned. A ‘watch’ status indicates

hat a counterparty is subject to increased monitoring and
appropriate follow-up measures in order to prevent further
deterioration or a default. Indicators for this status are
changes in risk profile, liquidity problems, management
issues, the market outlook, a potential breach of a credit
agreement, solvency issues and uncertain continuity.

/ 68

Restructuring & Recovery
Credit facilities that are subject to a default event are
mandatorily transferred to the Financial Restructuring &
Recovery department (FR&R). Credit facilities identified as
having a significantly high risk can be transferred to FR&R

if specialised restructuring knowledge is required. If a ‘going
concern’ approach is applicable and return to a performing
status is considered likely, the credit facility is transferred

‘o the Restructuring team, which will devise a plan aimed
either at rehabilitation or at enhancing the likelihood of full
repayment. In all other cases, the credit facility is transferred
o the Recovery team.

Programme lending contracts are transferred to the
Restructuring team if a default status is assigned because
payments have been past due for more than 90 days or
because another default trigger applies. If restructuring

is ultimately ineffective, the client is transferred to other
internal departments or external parties (such as Intrum)
or debt collection.

Once a client is considered able to meet its future payment
obligations and the involvement of FR&R is no longer
required, the client is transferred back to the business line.

FR&R plays a significant role in the execution of the
bank's non-performing exposure (NPE) strategy. Policies
on the management of NPE include valuation of collateral,
monitoring of the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and
ensuring this ratio remains well below the threshold of 5%.
We have set NPE targets for each business segment

and specific strategies for sectors with increased levels
of non-performing loans. The definition of non-performing
is similar to the definition of default and impaired. The
differences are explained under ‘Non-performing versus
default and impaired’.

Counterparty credit risk

ABN AMRO primarily incurs counterparty credit risk (CCR)
in two business activities, firstly within ABN AMRO Bank
through over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities
financing transactions with other financial institutions
(including positions taken to manage our interest rate
hedging and liquidity position) and secondly in the business
of ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. These two main sources

of CCR are managed separately and are subject to various
different features of risk management.

Credit concentration risk b

Credit concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from large
exposures, relative to the bank's total risk exposure, to a
single counterparty or to counterparties that are positively
and highly correlated. As limiting excessive concentrations
is fundamental to our credit risk strategy, we aim to keep
the credit risk portfolio sufficiently granular and diversified.

To avoid excessive credit risk concentrations,

Risk Management sets maximum levels for subgroups

in the following categories:

H Single counterparty and groups of related counterparties
(counterparty concentration);

H Countries (geographic concentration);

H Industry sectors (industry concentration).

Counterparty concentration

Counterparty concentration credit risk is the risk of loss
arising from relatively large exposures to counterparties
belonging to the same risk group. The One Obligor
Exposure (OOE) is the exposure to a risk group and
includes all drawn and undrawn credit facilities granted,
plus all indirect exposure to the risk group, including
guarantees and any other recourse claims. A risk group is
an interrelated group of counterparties with a high degree
of dependency on each other due to a control relationship.
This control relationship may be due to direct or indirect
majority interests being held by the same shareholder or
group of shareholders. Counterparty credit concentration
risk is measured by the OOE and the Economic Capital (EC)
per counterparty. The bank limits its counterparty credit

risk by setting OOE and EC limits. Additionally, all credit
applications with an OOE and/or EC above a certain threshold
are reviewed by the Executive Board.

Geographic concentration

ABN AMRO has branches and subsidiaries located
outside the Netherlands, as well as clients who operate
internationally. Consequently the bank is exposed to
country risk, which is the risk of credit losses arising

from country-specific events or circumstances. Under the
new strategy for CIB announced in Q2 2020, geographical
concentration continues to be relevant because we
maintain a presence in multiple countries.

Management of country risk focuses on cross-border risk,
which includes the risk that funds, goods or services cannot

be transferred out of a country as a result of actions by
local authorities in that country or other events. These risks
are managed by setting country credit limits, based on
individual country analyses by economic, compliance and
country risk experts. Country limits are reviewed at least
once a year. Each country also has an internal credit rating,
which is reviewed and approved twice a year and is an
important factor in managing country concentration risks.
As the Netherlands is our home country, it is not included
in any concentration risk appetite statement or setting

of credit limits.

Industry concentration

Industry concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from
a relatively large credit exposure to counterparties active
in a single industry. Industry concentration risk arises
when deterioration in a specific industry has an effect on

/ 69

all credit exposures relating to that industry. ABN AMRO
manages its industry concentrations by setting limits on
economic capital (EC) for credit risk for each industry as

a percentage of total EC for credit risk. In addition to the
EC limits, EC concentration checkpoints are set to facilitate
timely and sufficient management interventions so as

to avoid limits being breached.

Credit risk measurement b

The models used for the measurement and management
of credit risk vary from purely statistical to expert-based
models and employ both quantitative and qualitative risk
drivers. All models are subject to the bank’s model risk
management framework. They undergo initial validation

by the independent model validation function before their
first use, and annually thereafter. Independent validation is
also required when a model undergoes a material change.

Definition of default

All the models use a consistent definition of default, which

has been specified to be in line with regulations. A default

is deemed to have occurred when:

H the counterparty is past due by more than 90 days on
any material financial credit obligation to the bank; or

H the bank considers the borrower to be unlikely to meet
its contractual obligations (unlikely-to-pay or UTP).

The materiality of a financial obligation past due is assessed
against an absolute and a relative threshold, in line with
regulatory standards. To determine unlikeliness to pay, the
bank has specified both mandatory default triggers (always
resulting in the assignment of a default status and whereby
no additional expert judgment is allowed) and judgmental
triggers (requiring an assessment by credit risk managers
to determine whether the UTP indications should result

in a default classification).

Ending of the default classification for non-forborne
exposures is considered when none of the default triggers
continues to apply and a (probation) cure period of at least
three months has passed since the default trigger ceased
to apply. For forborne exposures, a twelve-month cure period
starts from the moment the last forbearance measure

or default trigger was applied. After the cure period,

an assessment is completed to establish whether the
improvement in the credit quality is factual and permanent
(including, for example, no remaining past due amounts).

Probability of default

The Probability of Default (PD) indicates the likelihood that
a counterparty or exposure will default within a one-year
time horizon. For the non-programme lending portfolio,
the PD maps to and is expressed as an internal uniform
counterparty rating (UCR). The UCR rating scale consists
of 14 performing ratings, each representing a fixed PD
range. The indicative mapping of the internal UCR rating

Loss Given Default This approach prescribes the risk weights to be applied
Loss Given Default (LGD) models estimate the amount ‘o the exposure value in order to calculate RWA. Other

the bank would lose if the counterparty were to default.
LGD is expressed as a percentage of the outstanding
amount at default. On credit facilities that are not in default,
LGD estimates are influenced by the risk mitigating
techniques used by the bank (such as the use of collateral),
the collateral cover, the credit facility's seniority and
structure, and the bank's view of the creditorfriendliness
of the relevant country’s legal framework.

Exposure at default

Exposure at Default (EAD) models estimate the expected
exposure at the time a counterparty defaults. If all or

part of a facility is undrawn (i.e. the outstanding amount
is less than the approved limit) at the time of the EAD
calculation, a portion of the undrawn amount is added

to the exposure to reflect the tendency of counterparties
to utilise larger portions of their approved credit facilities
when nearing default.

Capital for credit risk

Regulatory capital

For the purpose of determining capital requirements

for credit risk, ABN AMRO applies the Advanced Internal
Rating Based (A-IRB) approach to the vast majority of its
portfolio. Under this approach, the previously described
internal estimates for PD, EAD and LGD are used to calculate
Credit Risk RWA. For a number of smaller portfolios, RWA

is determined according to the Standardised Approach (SA).

Economic capital

The EC model for credit risk uses a Monte Carlo simulation
‘0 determine a full portfolio loss distribution, taking into
account specific portfolio characteristics and diversification
effects. Loan facilities are valued on an economic value
(mark-to-market) basis to ensure that loss estimates can
be based not only on defaulting borrowers, but also on
possible credit migrations and changes associated with

he market values of loans.

Credit quality and impairment b

We continuously monitor the credit portfolio for signs
indicating that the counterparty may become credit
impaired in the future. Loans at risk are classified into
different risk categories for individual counterparties

and into days-in-arrears buckets for groups of aggregated
counterparties in order to optimise monitoring and review
of these loans.

Forbearance

Forbearance is the process of making concessions to
clients who are or will soon be experiencing financial
difficulty, with the intention of bringing them back within
their payment capacity. A forborne asset is any contract
that has been entered into with a counterparty who is

in or about to face financial difficulty, and that has been
refinanced or modified on terms and conditions that we
would not have accepted if the counterparty had been
ABN AMR®Mnnual Report 2020

financially healthy. Collective concessions, such as the
automatic moratoria on payments that were granted as
part of the Covid-19 measures, do not necessarily lead to
a forbearance classification. The Risk, funding & capital

/ 71

review section includes a separate section on Covid-19
to provide more information on the accounting treatment
of measures relating to Covid-19.

Non-forborne Forborne Non-forborne

Defaulted forbearance clients
remain defaulted for at least a year

Performing Cure ! 1 year

Forbearance measure End cure period

Performing Non-performing

Forbearance measures can be applied to contracts on which
the counterparty has already defaulted, as well as to contracts
that are still performing. If the contract is performing at the
time the forbearance measure is taken, an assessment is
made to determine whether the measure is likely to end in
default. A forborne contract will cease to qualify as forborne
only when all the following conditions are met:

H The contract is considered performing;

H Aminimum probation period of at least two years has
passed since the last forbearance measure and/or the
date the forborne contract was considered performing
(whichever is later);

H Regular and timely payments of more than an
insignificant amount of principal or interest have been
made during at least half of the probation period;

H The counterparty does not have any contract, within
the credit agreement, that is more than 30 days past
due at the end of the probation period.

If the forborne contract is or has become non-performing

at the time of the forbearance measure, a mandatory cure
period of at least one year applies to the contract before it
is returned to performing status. The cure period starts when
the contract becomes non-performing or, if the contract
was already non-performing, when the last forbearance
measure was taken. More information about non-performing
contracts can be found at the end of this section.

Past due credit exposures

A financial asset is past due if a counterparty fails to make a
payment on the contractually due date or if the counterparty
has exceeded an agreed credit limit. ABN AMRO starts
counting days past due from the first day that a counterparty
is past due on any financial obligation.

Accounting policy for measuring allowances
for credit losses b

ABN AMRO recognises loss allowances based on
the Expected Credit Loss model (ECL) of IFRS 9,
which is designed to be forward-looking. The IFRS 9
impairment requirements are applicable to financial
assets measured at amortised cost or fair value
through other comprehensive income (FVOC]), loan
commitments and financial guarantee contracts. These
financial instruments are divided into three groups,
depending on the stage of credit quality deterioration:

Stage triggers

We use quantitative and qualitative stage triggers to
determine whether a financial instrument should be
classified as stage 1 or stage 2.

Quantitative stage trigger

The key quantitative metric that determines when a

financial instrument is transferred from stage 1 to stage

2 is the deterioration in the lifetime probability of default

(LPD) from the date of origination to the reporting date,

based on internal data. The LPD represents the likelihood

that a counterparty will default during the lifetime of the

financial instrument and depends on credit risk drivers

such as:

H product characteristics (e.g. repayment and interest
terms, term of the product);

H the financial condition of the borrower;

H the number of days past due;

H expected developments in the economy.

The lifetime PD (LPD) deterioration (.PDD) measures
the relative difference between the remaining lifetime
PD at reporting (LPDR) and the remaining lifetime PD
at origination (_PDO) as LPDD = LPDR/LPDO.
If the LPD deterioration of an exposure is above a
predefined threshold, the LPD is considered to be
significantly deteriorated, the exposure is transferred

to stage 2 and impairment allowances equal to the
lifetime expected credit loss are recognised. If the LPD
deterioration subsequently reduces and falls below the
threshold, the client is transferred back to stage 1. When
determining the thresholds, ABN AMRO distinguishes
between various portfolios within consumer lending,
residential mortgages and corporate loans. A specific
threshold is calculated for each portfolio, based on a
statistical method. Due to limitations in the availability of
historical data, ABN AMRO currently uses the 12-month
PD as a proxy for LPD for consumer lending and
corporate loans. We consider deterioration in the

Effective interest on gross carrying am@int

Effective interest on amortised cos

(gross carrying amount less loss allowance)

12-month PD to be appropriately representative of LPD
deterioration for the portfolios where the LPD is not
available. The table below shows LPD deterioration
thresholds for transfers to stage 2 that were applied at
31 December 2020. The values shown represent the
ratio between LPD at reporting and LPD at origination
at which transfer to stage 2 is triggered. As thresholds
are determined for each ECL model and each product
class uses multiple ECL models, ranges are shown.

Range of PD deterioration thresholds b

Product class Range

Consumer lending 3.1x-8.3x
Residential mortgages 1.2x-2.8x
Corporate loans 1.7x-5.0x

Qualitative stage triggers

The bank transfers a financial instrument from stage 1 to

stage 2 if the instrument meets any one of the following

qualitative triggers:

H Forborne status of a borrower;

H Watch status of a borrower. ABN AMRO assigns
the watch status to counterparties with an increased
credit risk. This process allows for intensive
monitoring, early detection of deterioration in the
credit portfolio and appropriate follow-up measures;

H The client has become non-performing (but is not
in default);

H A delinquency-based regulatory backstop is in place,
such that the credit risk of financial assets that are
more than 30 days past due will be assumed to have
significantly increased.

To account for the widespread impact of Covid-19 on
credit risk, we temporarily added the industry sector of
the client as an additional qualitative trigger for clients in
Commercial Banking. More information on this can be
found in the Update on Covid-19 in the Risk, funding &

Favourable changes in credit risk are recognised
consistently with unfavourable changes in credit risk,
except when applying a probation period for financial
instruments that are forborne or more than 30 days
past due.

H Forborne financial instruments are transferred back
from stage 2 to stage 1 only after a probation period
of at least two years has ended in line with the
ABN AMRO forbearance policy. Stage 3 forborne
instruments transfer back to stage 2 after a cure
period of at least one year;

H For financial instruments that are 30 days past due, a
three-month probation period is applied for transfers
from stage 2 to stage 1.

Calculation method

The amount of expected credit loss allowances is based

on the probability-weighted present value of all expected

cash shortfalls over the remaining life of the financial
instrument for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures.

ABN AMRO distinguishes between two types of

calculation methods for credit loss allowances:

H Individual Lifetime ECL (LECL) for credit-impaired
(stage 3) financial instruments with exposures above
EUR 3 million;

H Collective 12-month ECL (stage 1) and LECL (stage 2
and 3) for financial instruments that have similar
credit risk characteristics (e.g. residential mortgages,

/ 73

compared to the on-balance sheet amount of the credit
facility or product and an absolute threshold, with a
minimum past due amount of EUR 100 for programme
lending or EUR 500 for non-programme lending). These
definitions are in line with the new definition of default
introduced in the first half of 2020. Our definitions of
default and impaired are aligned.

Stage 2 Stage 3

consumer loans and SME loans) are clustered in
portfolios and collectively assessed for impairment
losses. A collective impairment calculation approach
based on individual parameters is also applied

to stage 3 exposures below EUR 3 million.

ABN AMRO has models to quantify the Probability
of Loss (PL), Loss Given Loss (LGL) and Exposure
at Loss (EAL) for the purpose of calculating the
collective 12-month ECL and LECL for these
financial instruments.

Lifetime expected credit loss

ABN AMRO defines the lifetime of credit as the
maximum contractual period during which the bank is
exposed to credit risk and not a longer period, even if
that longer period is consistent with business practice.
For some contracts, such as overdraft facilities or credit
cards, no end date is specified or amounts can be
contractually withdrawn by the lender at short notice.
In these cases, ABN AMRO uses behavioural maturity
models that rely on historical client behaviour to
determine future expected exposures.

Forward-looking information

For expected credit loss calculations, ABN AMRO
uses three different scenarios of future economic
developments: a baseline (or most likely) scenario,
negative scenario and a positive scenario.

The three scenarios are incorporated into the expected

repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic), the scenarios
and their weights are reviewed each quarter and adjusted
if necessary. Details of the scenarios and their weights
used in the reporting period can be found in Credit risk in
the Risk, funding & capital review section.

The baseline scenario is based on Group Economics’
regular macroeconomic forecasts and is reviewed at
each reporting date. The Group Economics analysts
consider a range of external sources in order to develop
he forecasts for the different macroeconomic variables
MEVs) required, including GDP the unemployment rate,
he housing price index, oil prices and 3-month Euribor.
They check their views and assumptions against external
views and assumptions. The preliminary forecasts for

he different countries undergo a challenge process

‘© ensure they are reasonable and consistent. To reduce
he risk of biased forecasts, the final MEVs are again
checked against external forecasts and then submitted to
he Scenario and Stress-testing Committee for approval.

Both alternative scenarios reflect the lower and upper
evels for the different macroeconomic variables, whereby
he whole range is meant to cover roughly 85% of

he possible economic future. For most MEVs, Group
Economics uses its standard deviations. These are
calculated on the basis of realised figures in the past

‘ew decades. The extent to which MEVs actually deviate
over time from their historical means reflects the past
materialisation of negative and positive risks in the
economy. A probability of about 85% roughly corresponds
to a standard deviation of plus and minus one and a half.

For the purpose of scenario analysis, the forecasts period
is five years. It is assumed that MEVs gradually move

to their potential or equilibrium values after the second
year. For each specific portfolio, a selection of variables
is made for calculating the expected credit loss, based
on statistical relevance and expert judgment.

Non-performing versus default and impaired
Definitions for default and impaired are aligned and
form the basis for most credit risk reporting in this
report. For specific reporting purposes ABN AMRO also
distinguishes between performing and non-performing
exposures. The criteria for non-performing exposures
are broader than those applying to default or impaired.

An exposure is qualified as non-performing if:
H the counterparty is in default; or
H the counterparty is no longer in default, but

/ 74

has received an additional forbearance measure,
or became more than 30 days past due during
the forborne probation period

An exposure is categorised as non-performing for the
entire amount, taking no account of any available
collateral, and including the following revocable and
irrevocable off-balance sheet items:

H loan commitments;

H financial guarantees at risk of being called, including
the underlying guaranteed exposure that meets the
criteria of non-performing;

H any other financial commitments.

The non-performing classification typically ends when
the counterparty is no longer in default and the cure
period has ended. For non-performing exposures that
are not in default, a cure period of at least 12 months
applies from the date the exposure became non-
performing. After this 12-month period, an assessment
is made to establish whether the improvement of

the credit quality is factual and permanent (including a
requirement for no past due amounts). This is comparable
to the out-of-default assessment.

In monetary terms, the difference between non-
performing and default or impaired amounts to less
than 5% of total non-performing exposure.

Cured financial assets

When a credit impaired financial asset cures, the
interest that was previously unrecognised is reported
as an impairment release in the impairment charge
rather than as a credit to the interest income calculated
using the effective interest method.

Write-off

A loan is written off against the related loan loss

allowance if the likelihood of repayment falls below

a certain point or the financial asset reaches a certain

stage of delinquency.

H For non-programme lending, a write-off must be
taken if all possible means of recovery have been
exhausted and it has become clear that there is a
low probability of recovering the debt, either in part
or full.

H Most of the programme lending facilities are
automatically written-off after 1,080 days in default.

Such loans are written off after all the necessary
procedures have been completed and the amount of
the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries
of amounts previously written off are credited to
impairment charges on financial instruments in the
income statement.

Credit risk mitigation

Credit risk mitigation techniques are used by the bank to
reduce the credit risk associated with its credit exposures.
Such techniques relate mainly to collateral management and
guarantees, offsetting financial assets and liabilities, and
enforcing master netting agreements or similar instruments.

Credit risk mitigation techniques themselves entail risks
and, as such, have to meet certain requirements so that
they can be used effectively and in line with the bank’s risk
appetite. For this reason, ABN AMRO has established
mandatory, bank-wide policies governing the use and
management of credit risk mitigation techniques. These are
in line with regulatory requirements, as well as with the
needs of the bank and its clients. These bank-wide policies
provide the overarching rules to be met by business-specific
procedures and processes related to credit risk mitigation.

Collateral management and guarantees
Collateral and guarantees represent assets with material
value that have been received by (or pledged to) the bank
to secure obligations under a credit facility or other exposure.
To be effective, such security must give the bank the right
to appropriate and liquidate collateral on time and without
impediment so that losses on the exposure at default
are minimised.

In addition to minimising exposure risk, eligible collateral

and guarantees can also reduce the regulatory and economic
capital the bank is required to hold as a buffer for unexpected
losses. The Capital Requirements Regulation prescribes the
criteria that collateral must meet to become eligible for capital

reduction. These criteria, which provide for legal effectiveness
and for the enforceability, valuation and monitoring of

collateral, are aimed at the effective and timely realisation
of collateral.

/ 75

Accounting policy for offsetting financial assets
and liabilities b

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net
amount is reported on the EU IFRS balance sheet,

if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the
recognised amounts and there is an intention either

to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously. The bank applies netting to
debtor and creditor balances, such as current accounts,
where offsetting is justified by formal agreement with
the client, provided they meet the applicable criteria.

Accounting policy for enforceable master netting
agreements or similar instruments b

Enforceable master netting arrangements take into
account all agreements containing conditions that allow
offsetting in the event of default. In addition, agreements
are enforceable if the bank has a legally enforceable
right to offset and no ability and/or intention to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. These
arrangements include derivative clearing agreements,
global master repurchase agreements and global master
securities lending agreements.

Market risk management

This section provides information on:
H Market risk in the banking book
H Market risk in the trading book

Market risk in the banking book b

arket risk in the banking book is the risk that the economic
value of equity or the income of the bank will decline
because of unfavourable market movements. Market risk

in the banking book consists predominantly of interest

rate risk and credit spread risk in the liquidity portfolio.
Funding spread risk, foreign exchange risk, equity risk and
property risk are also recognised as market risks in the
banking book. However, these are relatively immaterial.

Interest rate risk in the banking book

nterest rate risk is the risk of losses in the economic value
of equity or the bank's net interest income (NII) due to
unfavourable yield curve developments, including changes in
he volatility of the yield curve. In order to model and measure
interest rate risk, assumptions on client behaviour are made,
most importantly with respect to the maturity of savings and
he prepayment of mortgages. These assumptions influence
he anticipated interest cash flow pattern. Interest rate risk
is continuously managed in line with the risk appetite as the
profile of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet can
change if client behaviour changes.

The main sources of interest rate risk are:

H The maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities.
ABN AMRO provides mortgages and commercial loans
with fixed interest terms. These assets are funded by
non-maturing deposits and wholesale funding with
a shorter average interest maturity than the assets;

H Client behaviour, which determines the maturity profile
of some of our products. As we use models to predict
this behaviour, we are exposed to model risk.

Key assumptions for modelling client behaviour

From an interest rate risk perspective, the following aspects

of client behaviour are the most important:

H Client behaviour with respect to early redemption of
residential mortgages. This has a significant impact on the
average interest maturity of the mortgage portfolio. Clients
have the option to fully or partially prepay mortgages before
maturity. Prepayments can be triggered by, for example,
relocation, redemption or curtailment. An important driver
of prepayments is the interest rate incentive, i.e. the
difference between a client's current mortgage rate and
prevailing mortgage rates. Future mortgage rates are
simulated using a Monte Carlo approach. In addition
to the interest rate incentive, other drivers such as loan

/ 76

age, seasonality and house price developments are also
taken into account;

H Client acceptance of the volume offered and the
deviation between the offered rate and the actual coupon
on an offered residential mortgage;

H Client behaviour with respect to non-maturing deposits
that are callable on demand. Future client rates for
savings and current accounts are modelled using a
replicating portfolio model. Modelled client rates depend
on current or lagged yield curves and funding costs. A
maximum maturity of 10 years is assumed. The resulting
duration depends on product type and client behaviour.
The average duration for retail portfolios is around 3
years, well below the requlatory 5-year cap.

The metrics used for market risk in the banking book are
dependent upon the assumptions made in the behavioural
models. Models must therefore be based on extensive
research, including historical data on observed client
behaviour. Models must be independently validated and
approved by the mandated risk committees. Models are
periodically assessed to determine whether they behave
appropriately and are statistically sound; if required, they
are adjusted.

Risk measurement for interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is measured by net interest income (NII) at
risk, present value of 1 basis point (PVO1), economic value

of equity (EVE) at risk and economic capital for market risk

in the banking book.

Economic capital for market risk in the banking book is
calculated using a parametric Monte Carlo simulation model
that determines the economic capital needed to absorb
losses due to adverse movements in interest rates, client
behaviour for mortgages and non-maturing deposits,
volatility, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.

These metrics are complemented with stress testing and
scenario analysis, which are used to ensure a comprehensive
approach to risk management and to identify potential
weaknesses. Stress testing and scenario analyses go
beyond determining the impact of alternative developments
of interest rates. Assumptions with respect to modelling
and client behaviour are also tested. A combination of
market and product floors is applied. These floors are
reviewed periodically.

For management purposes, the interest rate risk position
is monitored by the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO)
on a monthly basis. The above metrics are also regularly
reported to the Executive Board.

Credit spread risk in the banking book

Credit spread risk is the risk of losses due to adverse
movements in the credit spread of assets. The main source
is from bonds held for liquidity purposes. It is measured as
the impact on economic value of a 1bp change in spreads
to a swap rate. The sensitivity is measured for individual
term points, as well as for a parallel shift of the curve.

Funding spread risk

Funding spread risk is the risk of losses due to adverse
movements in the term structure of rates at which

ABN AMRO can fund itself —- expressed as a spread to

a benchmark such as Euribor. Funding spread movements
can arise due to changes in, for example, the perceived
credit quality of ABN AMRO, changes in the competitive
environment or changes in liquidity premiums. They may
be entity-specific or systemic in nature. If funding spreads
widen, it costs more to fund assets on the balance sheet.
Unless this increased spread is passed on to clients by
increasing client rates, projected net interest income will
decrease. The funding spread risk is measured using an
Nll-at-risk approach whereby the funding spread increases.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange (FX) risk is the risk arising from adverse
movements in FX spot and forward rates and/or FX
volatility. It is managed within the bank by ALM and
Treasury. As a general rule, foreign exchange risk is hedged
by using cross-currency swaps to swap the exposure in
oreign currency to EUR. If, for operational reasons, it is
inefficient to hedge exposures in foreign currencies, an
open currency position (OCP) remains. This is measured
by the aggregated net position per currency, except for
EUR. The OCP is monitored regularly, and limits apply on a
ocal and aggregate level. Both for assets and for liabilities,
USD is the largest non-EUR exposure.

Market risk management for the banking book

ABN AMRO has a detailed risk management framework
in place to identify, measure and control market risk in the
banking book. This framework provides assurance that the
banking book activities remain consistent with the bank's
strategy to pursue a moderate risk profile. The day-to-day
management is delegated from the Asset & Liability
Committee to Asset and Liability Management, while
Treasury is responsible for the execution of hedge
transactions. These departments form the first line of
defence. Market & ALM/T Risk acts as the second line

of defence.

The risk appetite is articulated in terms of net interest
income, the economic value of equity and the economic
capital for market risk in the banking book, and expresses
the maximum loss the bank is willing to accept. The risk
appetite is cascaded into a limit framework.

/ 77

To manage the interest rate sensitivity in the banking book
and keep in line with the bank's strategy and risk appetite,
ABN AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro) hedges
and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges to swap fixed
interest rates for floating interest rate positions. Micro
hedges are used to swap fixed funding transactions and
fixed investments in the liquidity buffer for floating interest
rate positions. In addition, macro hedging is applied in order
to align with the bank's strategy to contribute to a stable NIl
while protecting the economic value of equity.

Market risk in the trading book
Positions held with trading intent and hedges for positions
held with trading intent must be included in the bank's
trading book. The Central Trading Risk policy describes the
positions included in the trading book and the criteria for
transferring risk and positions between the trading and
banking books. As part of its business strategy, ABN AMRO
facilitates client orders, acts as a market maker in key markets
and provides liquidity to clients, including institutional
investors and private clients. Market risk in the trading book
is the risk of losses in market value due to adverse market
movements. The following market risks are inherent in the
trading book:
H Interest rate risk, arising from adverse changes in
interest rate risk curves and/or interest rate volatilities;
H Credit spread risk, arising from adverse changes in the
term structure of credit spreads and/or from changing
credit quality of debt securities or CDS reference
entities, with an impact on default probabilities;

H Equity risk, arising from adverse changes in equity
prices, dividends and volatilities;

H Commodity risk, arising from adverse changes in
commodity prices;

H Foreign exchange risk, arising from adverse changes
in FX spot and forward rates and/or FX volatility.

Market risk measurement for the trading book b
ABN AMRO measures and manages market risk in the
rading book on a daily basis. The key metrics used are
economic capital, regulatory capital, Value-at-Risk (VaR),
Stressed VaR (SVaR) and Incremental Risk Charge (IRC),
ogether with a wide array of stress and scenario tests,
sensitivity measures, concentration limits and notional
imits. These metrics are measured and monitored on a
daily basis. Appropriate limits are set at bank level in the
Risk Appetite Statement and at bank and business-line
evels in the limit framework, in line with the general risk
principles in the Central Trading Risk policy.

etrics and models are managed, reviewed, assessed and,
if required, adjusted in a similar way as in the banking book.
Other important tools to ensure the adequacy of the models,
alongside the formal validation and review of models,

are the daily explanation of risk reporting figures, periodic
portfolio reviews and regular back-testing.

Validation procedure

For all models, including market risk models, we have a
model risk policy in place. This policy requires that model
assumptions and limitations are documented and
independently validated by Model Validation. For material
changes, the regulator performs an onsite investigation
before such a model change is applied in production.

Economic capital

The calculation of economic capital for market risk in the
trading book is based on a daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) market
risk measure and historical scenarios simulating stress events
such as ‘Black Monday’ and the financial markets crisis.

Stress testing and scenario analysis

Stress testing and scenario analysis are designed to focus
specifically on the impact of tail events that are outside the
VaR confidence interval. We perform daily stress tests for
large movements in risk factors. Scenario analyses are also
conducted frequently to evaluate the impacts of extreme
market events that cover multiple risk factors, and the
results of these tests are monitored. These scenarios can
be based on historical or hypothetical events, or on a
combination of the two.

Sensitivities

For each risk type sensitivities are monitored against limits.
This includes all risk types mentioned above and the basis

risks in the trading portfolio. In addition, the holding period

is monitored as a measure of the liquidity of the positions.

Market risk management for the trading book b
ABN AMRO has in place a detailed risk management
ramework to identify, measure and control market risk in

he bank's trading activities are consistent with its client-
ocused business strategy and moderate risk profile. In
accordance with the strategy, the Business Risk Committee
Trading annually approves trading mandates, which define
he nature and amount of the permitted transactions and
risks, and the associated constraints. The Business Risk
Committee Trading is a subsidiary committee of the Group
Risk Committee.

Valuation adjustments

For the trading book, we take into account adjustments for
counterparty risk on our clients (Credit Valuation Adjustment),
ABN AMRO funding costs (Funding Valuation Adjustment)
and ABN AMRO credit risk (Debt Valuation Adjustment).

Trading book positions are subject to prudent valuation
standards in accordance with regulatory requirements.

The prudent value is derived from IFRS accounting fair value
and includes additional potential value adjustments.

Operational (non-financial) risk management

This section provides information on:
H Operational risk management approach
H Operational risk measurement

H Specific operational risk areas

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems
or from external events. This definition is in line with the
definition by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
Operational risk covers multiple non-financial risks, such as
HR risk, IT risk, compliance risk, legal risk, change risk, tax
risk and model risk.

Operational risk management approach

ABN AMRO has a converged approach to operational risk
management, providing the business with a clear and fair
view on the operational risks that the bank faces and the
way these should be managed. For this purpose, ABN AMRO
has in place a framework that enables operational risks to
be managed within the moderate risk profile. The Information
and Operational Risk Management (|&ORM) department sets
this framework for the bank in line with the requirements

of the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA). This
framework evolves and is kept current as experience
gained is incorporated. The main components of the
framework are schematically shown in the following figure.

Mitigation Transfer
Avoidance Risk acceptance

ABN AMRO's operational risk management framework
is supported by the three lines of defence (3LoD) model.
Our Vision for 3LoD is as follows:

We achieve ABN AMRO's purpose of ‘Banking for better,
or generations to come’ by organising 3LoD to deliver on
our strategic priorities, secure the continuity of our bank,
remain within our risk appetite and maintain our licence

© operate. We are clear on each other's responsibilities
and use a common language to communicate an integrated,
ransparent and consistent approach to managing our

risks with the common goal of taking better decisions

or all stakeholders.

The division and clarity in roles and responsibilities across
he three lines of defence reflect the bank's view that
managing operational risk requires a concerted effort from
all. Operational risk views are provided in risk reports at
various levels within the bank, up to the Executive Board
and Supervisory Board.

Framework for operational risk management

Risk identification, assessments, response and monitoring
activities are at the heart of our operational risk management
framework. Despite preventive measures being in place,
incidents and operational losses are inherent to our business.
ABN AMRO systematically tracks and analyses such events
in order to learn from them and use them as early warnings.
Together with scanning external developments, emerging
risks can also be identified for further assessment.

Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are monitored to signal adverse
risk developments.

Business managers perform assessments to identify

and assess risks, including scenarios for rare events.
Assessments are executed for business-as-usual activities
and for new initiatives and provide support by creating risk
awareness throughout the organisation. If a risk exceeds
or is predicted to be outside the risk appetite, the business
manager takes appropriate action. Actions may include
strengthening controls.

At least once a year, business managers monitor the
effectiveness of the controls in their areas of responsibility
and update them as necessary. Management may also decide
to avoid risks by ceasing certain operations, consciously
accept a certain risk or transfer a risk to insurance companies.
With respect to the latter option, the global insurance
programme in place is reviewed annually by the Group

Risk Committee.

Once a year, senior management also reviews the strategic
business objectives and the measures taken from a

risk perspective. At the end of each year, based on

the effectiveness of the control environment and on

the strategic risk outlook, senior management signs a

Specific operational risk areas

The bank has in place a dedicated organisation for
operational risk areas that require specific knowledge,
such as compliance risk, information security, business
continuity management and model risk management.

Compliance risk

Compliance risk is defined as the risk of failure to comply
with legislation and regulations, self-regulatory organisational
standards, values and business principles, and codes of
conduct or generally accepted market standards applicable
to the bank's services and activities. It can result in security
risks and incidents and in financial and reputational damage
arising from financial or other crime and misconduct or illegal
conduct on the part of clients, the bank or its employees.

ABN AMRO has to live up to continuing regulatory
expectations and mitigate their compliance risk. It is
expected to act as a gatekeeper in detecting financial and
economic crime, and to fulfil obligations arising under its
duty of care to clients and society. Increasing amounts of
resources are therefore devoted to the various investigations
and inquiries taking place, as well as to ensuring focused
governance and to improving the risk and control framework.

Information security

Information is one of the bank’s most valuable assets.

Our clients rely increasingly on digitalisation and online
banking, even more so during the Covid-19 outbreak.

This means proper functioning of the bank’s IT systems

is crucial. These systems run in complex information
infrastructures, connecting the bank's networks to public
networks. Banking processes and their supporting
information systems are therefore inherently vulnerable,
with threats to the security of client data and services.
Examples of such threats include social engineering and
phishing, computerassisted fraud, unauthorised disclosure
of confidential information, virus infections and ransomware,
and distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS).

In recognition of the vital importance of protecting its
information, systems and infrastructure at all times,

ABN AMRO has established a structured IT risk
management approach to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of information. This approach
defines the organisational framework, management

and staff responsibilities, and the information security
directives that apply to ABN AMRO, its vendors and third
parties with whom the bank exchanges information.

Business continuity management

Business continuity management (BCM) ensures
organisational resilience at all levels of ABN AMRO.

It focuses on setting up and maintaining ABN AMRO’s

/ 80

crisis management capability (i.e., framework, process,
tooling, people) to enable the organisation to remain
well-prepared and able to respond in a controlled and
effective crisis mode in the face of severe threats and
calamities such as the current Covid-19 outbreak. Our key
tasks include the following:
H Analysing threats and the business impact of calamities
and crises;
H Determining the strategies and solutions to be applied

in the event of a crisis — such as business recovery,

crisis management and IT disaster recovery planning

— so as to enable continuity of business operations;
H Documenting, periodically assessing and testing of these

strategies and solutions.

Model risk management

Models are developed and used to quantify the risk for
most risk types in the risk taxonomy. We define model risk
as the potential for adverse consequences from decisions
based on incorrect output of models, due to errors in the
development, implementation or use of such models.

This definition is in line with the definition in the EU Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR). To monitor and mitigate
risks arising from the use of these models, the model risk
management department functions as the second line

of defence. As an independent department it sets the
framework for the bank in line with regulatory requirements
on model risk and independently validates models before
they can be used. ABN AMRO has separate model
validation standards and procedures in place for this
purpose as part of the model risk management framework.

Operational risk measurement
n line with the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA),
he bank has in place an internally developed model

0 define the required own funds for operational risk

(i.e. operational risk capital). The AMA model estimates
potential operational risk losses (annually aggregated)

by combining forward-looking and backward-looking
views on operational risk events.

Risk self-assessments and scenario analyses provide a
orward-looking view. Experts use these tools to build
scenarios to evaluate future risks and estimate the severity
of potential losses that could occur. The resulting estimates
are used as data input for the model. In these scenarios,
experts take into consideration the quality of the bank’s
control environment, its processes, systems and people,
as well as external circumstances and changes that may
have an influence. The ongoing relevance of the estimations
(and hence of the capital) is safeguarded by reviewing

the scenarios at regular intervals, as well as when major
changes occur in the risk profile.

Alongside these expert-based estimations, the model also
uses historical loss data from ABN AMRO and the banking
industry. Historical loss data are included as these are

assumed to provide some level of predictive information
about future losses.

Capital for operational risk

The level of AMA capital is derived from the results of the
model calculations. The bank applies a 99.95% confidence
level to the annually aggregated losses when calculating
the operational risk economic capital, whereas a 99.9%
confidence level is applied to calculate regulatory operational
risk capital. The adequacy of the capital levels is monitored
on a quarterly basis; if issues occur — for example, regarding
the reliability of data — add-ons can be applied.

Funding & liquidity risk management

Liquidity risk is the risk that actual and potential payments
or collateral posting obligations cannot be met on a timely
basis, or only at excessive costs. There are two types of
liquidity risk:

H Funding liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to
accommodate both expected and unexpected current
and future cash outflows and collateral needs because
insufficient cash is available. Eventually, this can affect
the bank's daily operations or its financial condition;

H Market liquidity risk is the risk that the bank cannot sell
an asset in a timely manner at a reasonable market price
due to insufficient market depth (insufficient supply and
demand) or market disruption. Market liquidity risk
includes the sensitivity in liquidity value of a portfolio
due to changes in the applicable haircuts and market
value. It also concerns uncertainty about the time
required to realise the liquidity value of the assets.

Strategy

Liquidity

We have a liquidity risk management framework in place
that helps us maintain a moderate risk profile and safeguards
the bank's reputation from a liquidity perspective. This
framework enables the bank to meet the regulatory
requirements and its payment obligations at a reasonable
cost, even under severely adverse conditions. We have
formulated a set of liquidity risk metrics and limits to
manage the bank's liquidity position. By maintaining a
smooth long-term maturity profile, limiting dependence

on wholesale funding and holding a solid liquidity buffer in
our main currencies, we maintain a prudent liquidity profile.
The bank's liquidity position is monitored on a daily basis.

Funding

ABN AMRO's main source of funding consists of deposits
from Retail Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking
and CIB clients. The remainder of our funding is raised largely
through various long-term wholesale funding instruments.
In the short-term, funding is raised via commercial

paper. The wholesale funding strategy is aligned to the
moderate risk profile. This strategy aims to optimise and
diversify the bank’s funding sources in order to maintain
market access and the targeted funding position. We aim
to have a balance sheet with a diverse, stable and cost-
efficient funding base.

The funding strategy takes the following guidelines

into account:

Risk management approach b

The natural maturity mismatch between loans and funding
requires liquidity risk management. We consider maturity
ransformation to be an integral part of the bank's business
model, which is why we closely monitor our liquidity
position and the resulting risks. We diversify our funding
sources to maintain market access, and we diversify
unding tenors to avoid a concentration of outflows.

We also hold a portfolio of highly liquid assets that can

be converted into cash in the event of unforeseen market
disruptions, thus allowing us to meet payment and collateral
obligations at all times.

Funding and liquidity risk is managed centrally. We incorporate
liquidity costs into the pricing of our day-to-day business
activities.

In managing the risks, a clear distinction is made between
going-concern and contingency risk management.

Going-concern management

Going-concern management entails management of the

day-to-day liquidity position within specified limits. This

allows us to meet payment obligations on a timely basis.

The most important metrics we use are:

H Stress testing: We conduct monthly and ad hoc stress
tests in which we evaluate the impact of cash in- and
outflows under plausible stress scenarios. Both market-

ide and bank-specific stress scenarios are defined and
analysed. The goal of stress testing is twofold. Firstly, it
helps us to review our risk framework, i.e. the liquidity
buffer size, risk appetite and limits. Secondly, it allows
us to identify ways to reduce outflows in times of crisis;

H Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): The objective of the LCR
is to assess the bank's short-term resilience by ensuring
sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a significant
stress scenario lasting 30 calendar days;

H Survival period: The survival period reflects the period
that the bank's liquidity position is expected to remain
positive in an internal stress scenario in which wholesale
funding markets deteriorate and retail and commercial
clients withdraw a proportion of their deposits;

Capital management

Capital management strategy

The primary objective of the capital management strategy
is to ensure that capital adequacy requirements are met at
all times and that sufficient capital is available to support
the bank's strategy. Capital is a necessary resource for
doing business and defines the bank's commercial
possibilities. The balance between available and required
capital is managed centrally to optimise the use of available
capital. The basis of the capital management strategy is the
bank's risk appetite and its business plans. Other important
factors taken into account when managing the capital
position are expectations and requirements of external
stakeholders (such as regulators, investors, shareholders,
equity analysts, rating agencies and clients), the bank's
position in the market, market developments, contingent
capital needs and the feasibility of capital management
actions. Although ABN AMRO manages its capital centrally,
the group companies are sufficiently capitalised to comply
with all local regulatory solvency requirements and to meet
any local business needs. ABN AMRO's banking activities
are carried out by legal entities that are part of the bank’s
corporate tax unit. Apart from prevailing statutory and
regulatory legislation, there are no specific material
impediments for prompt transfer of the bank's regulatory
capital.

Dividend

The dividend policy takes into account matters including
current and pending regulatory capital requirements, our
risk profile, growth in commercial activities and market
factors. The dividend payout is set in the light of the bank’s
moderate risk profile and regulatory changes and to ensure
that dividend payments can be maintained in the future.

From 2018 onwards, the dividend payout policy was set

at 50% of net sustainable profit attributable to owners

of the parent company, excluding exceptional items that
significantly distorted profitability and excluding AT1 capital
securities. Additional distributions of above 50%, which
could be either special dividends or share buy-backs
(subject to regulatory approval), were considered if capital
was within or above the Basel Ill target range of 175-18.5%
and were also subject to other circumstances, including
regulatory and commercial considerations. The combined
distribution was at least 50% of net sustainable profit.

From 2021 onwards, the dividend payout has been set at
50% of reported net profit, after deduction of AT1 coupon
payments and minority interests. Interim dividends will be
considered at 40% of the reported H1 net profit, provided
profit is expected to be sustainable throughout the year,
at the discretion of the Board.

We have updated our CET1 capital target ratio to 138%
under Basel IV. When our Basel IV CET1 ratio is above

the threshold of 15%, we will consider share buy-backs,
subject to conditions and regulatory approval. Our threshold
of 15% reflects current uncertainties, as well as a buffer
for potential M&A. We intend to review the threshold

when current uncertainties have reduced. Buy-backs

will not be considered before the end of 2021.

Any distribution of dividend remains discretionary, and
ABN AMRO may propose deviations from the above policy.

Capital measurement and allocation

Capital adequacy is measured and monitored on an ongoing
basis against target capital ratios, which are derived from the
bank's overall risk appetite and strategy. Capital projections
and stress test scenarios, both market-wide and bank-
specific, are used to ensure that actual and future capital
evels remain above the targets. Capital is allocated to
businesses in a way that optimises the long-term value

of the bank while serving the bank’s strategic objectives.

n the capital allocation process, both risk-based and
non-risk-based return parameters are considered, taking
into account economic and regulatory capital requirements.
This process ensures that the bank meets its return targets
while maintaining a moderate risk profile in line with its

risk appetite.

Contingency capital management

Contingency plans are in place to address any capital issues
arising. The Contingency Capital Plan provides a framework
to detect capital adequacy stress by setting out various
early warning indicators. The plan also sets out a range

of actions that can be undertaken, based on the level

of severity and urgency of the issues.

Recovery and resolution planning

The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive requires

a recovery plan and a resolution plan to be in place.

ABN AMRO submitted a reviewed and updated version

of its bank recovery plan to the ECB in December 2020.
The Single Resolution Board (SRB) has prepared a resolution
plan, in which it concluded that the preferred resolution
strategy is a Single-Point-of-Entry strategy, with ABN AMRO
Bank N.V. as the resolution entity.

Business risk management

Business Risk is the risk that business earnings and franchise
value will decline and/or deviate from expectations because of
uncertainty in business income or in the expenses needing
to be incurred to generate business income. ABN AMRO
manages business risk by seeking to minimise the effect

of unexpected internal and/or external developments.

The key criteria for classifying a risk as a business risk are:

H An unexpected event that leads to uncertainty in present
or future business earnings and/or franchise value;

H Changes of drivers of future business earnings such as
uncertainty in volumes, margins, fee and commission
rates and/or business expenses.

Earnings are affected by various internal and external factors,
such as changes in client preferences, competition and
regulation. In addition, earnings are affected by technical,
societal, geopolitical and economic developments, such

as the outbreak of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns.

When assessing the pressure from external factors

contributing to an increase or decrease in the business risk,

at least the following elements are considered:

H The key macroeconomic variables within which the bank
operates or will operate based on its main geographies.
Examples of key variables include gross domestic
product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates
and house price indices;

H The competitive landscape and how it is likely to evolve,
considering the activities of the bank's peers;

H Expected growth in target markets, and the activities
and plans of key competitors in these target markets;

H Overall trends in the market that may have an impact
on performance and profitability. This should include,
as aminimum, regulatory trends, technological trends
and societal/demographic trends;

H The contamination effects that risks may have on other
risk types, and risks downstream or upstream in client
supply chains that may cause domino effects (this includes
the impact of Covid-19).

/ 85

ABN AMRO continually monitors and responds to the key
external and internal factors and elements within these
factors. The disclosure and monitoring of the business risk
drivers is based, among other things, on the ERM report.
The bank mitigates sensitivity to business risk drivers
hrough discussions at senior management and board level
hat address developments in these drivers in an effective
and timely manner. Business risk is also included in

he capital buffer that is meant to safeguard our position

in the case of extreme events.

The bank's strategy and business risk are related. The
strategy incorporates mitigation of unexpected events

and changes in business risk drivers. Regular review of the
strategy ensures alignment with developments in business
risk. To ensure that the bank's strategy is pursued and the
long-term strategic goals (financial and non-financial) are
met, our business plans and budgets take these strategic
goals into account.

Economic capital for business risk

Economic capital is used to mitigate the negative effects

of unexpected business risk events. The economic capital
for business risk reflects the maximum downward deviation
of actual versus expected net operating profit in one year,
excluding any impact already covered by other risk types
(e.g. impairments for credit risk).

To determine the economic capital for business risk,

a combination of historical and forward-looking scenarios

is collected from experts in each business line and from
Group Economics. These scenarios determine the sensitivity
of macroeconomic variables or industry performance
indicators to the business lines’ income. This sensitivity is
used to determine the volatility of income for each business
line, as well as any correlation between business lines.
Based on the individual volatilities, we use simulation

to calculate bank-wide volatility.

Sustainability risk management

This section provides information on:

H_ Sustainability risk policy framework

H Client assessment

H_ Risk measurement, monitoring and steering

H Climate risk approach

In our roles as lender and investor we may be exposed to
environmental, social and governmental (ESG) risks, either
through direct activities of our clients and the companies
in which we invest on behalf of our clients, or through
activities in these companies’ value chains. We manage
these sustainability risks in line with the bank's moderate
risk profile. Sustainability risk management also goes hand
in hand with the bank's sustainability strategy to support
our clients’ transition and accelerate the sustainability shift.

We define sustainability risk as the potential impact of ESG

issues on the earnings and value of the bank. In line with

regulatory and societal expectations we consider two sides:

H Inside-out risk: the impact of the bank and its clients on
ESG in the form, for example, of greenhouse gas
emissions, pollution and human rights infringements;

H Outside-in risk: the impact of ESG issues on the bank
and its clients in the form, for example, of physical risks
of global warming, biodiversity loss and transition risks.

Sustainability risk is a driver of other risk types, such as
credit risk, market risk and business risk. It can materialise
in the short term (directly), the medium term (1-5 years)
and the long term (5-30 years).

Sustainability risk policy framework

ABN AMRO applies a sustainability risk policy framework
that operates in accordance with the bank's ‘three lines
of defence’ model. This policy framework covers activities
primarily focused on corporate lending and payment and
investment services, but also extending to procurement,
human resources and product development. We updated
the framework in 2020 to reflect regulatory expectations
and have now integrated sustainability risk — and climate
and environmental risk, in particular — into our entire risk
management practice.

Specific requirements apply to clients operating in sectors
considered to have a particularly high sustainability risk.

The requirements we set define how we expect clients to
manage their sustainability risks: these risks are primarily
inside-out risks, but increasingly also include outside-in
risks. In line with our risk taxonomy, the requirements relate
to ESG risks, but also link to the themes on which our

corporate strategy is focused: climate, circularity and social
impact/human rights.

The requirements and other elements of the framework

are updated regularly. The updating in 2020 included new
requirements for financial institutions and for clients active
in animal protein production, as well as an updating of the
country sustainability risk list (containing a sustainability risk
rating for each country) and the controversial weapons list
(containing a list of the companies we will not finance or
invest in on behalf of our clients because the companies
manufacture or trade controversial weapons such as

cluster ammunition).

Client assessment

First-line relationship managers continue to use the Global
Sustainability Risk Index (GSRI) tool, developed by the bank,
to assess clients’ risk level based on the country and sector
sustainability risk ratings, and to assess adherence to our
sustainability risk framework and the applicable sector
specific requirements. We aim to extend the use of the
GSRI from clients in medium- and high-risk sectors to all
sectors. For clients in high-risk sectors, second-line advice
is mandatory.

Risk measurement, monitoring and steering

We measure and steer on sustainability risk in several

ways, reflecting both inside-out and outside-in risks.

In relation to climate change, for instance, we measure:

H the carbon intensity of our lending and investment
portfolios (using the PCAF methodology) and their
alignment with the objectives in the Paris Climate
Agreement (using the science-based target
methodology);

H progress on key carbon-reduction targets;

H coverage of physical and transition risk analyses
in relevant sector portfolios.

We also closely monitor our engagement activities.

We distinguish three types of engagement as a mitigation
strategy towards clients that do not fully comply with the
requirements in our Sustainability Risk Policy Framework:
normal-intensity engagement, high-intensity engagement
and thematic engagement. Normatlintensity engagement
is part of the regular client communication and review
cycle and addresses minor deviations or opportunities

for improvement. High-intensity engagement, on the
other hand, is a formal process in which the bank reaches
agreement with a client on significant improvements as a
condition of credit approval. Lastly, thematic engagement
entails engagement with multiple clients, and possibly
other stakeholders, on widerranging sustainability issues.

n 2020 we formalised the Engagement Advisory Committee
mandated by the Executive Board to oversee high-intensity
and thematic engagement.

n addition to a mitigation strategy, we also use engagement
as a tool to accelerate the sustainability shift. The bank's
ambition of ‘Banking for better for generations to come’ is
best served by our inclusive approach: rather than excluding
underperforming companies, we support them in improving
heir performance. In this way, sustainability risk management
contributes to achieving our sustainability strategy. In 2020
we published an updated climate statement in which

he intertwining of our sustainability risk management and
our sustainability strategy is set out specifically in relation

0 climate change.

Climate risk approach

ABN AMRO is strongly committed to implementing

the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's
Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD),
which we endorsed back in 2017. In 2019, we took our first
steps in using scenario analysis to measure and disclose
climate risk in our mortgage and upstream oil and gas
portfolios. In 2020 we extended the use of climate scenario
analysis to four additional sectors: commercial real estate,
agriculture, energy and shipping.

/ 87

These sectors were identified as priority sectors following
a heatmap exercise based on the methodology provided by
the UN Environmental Programme for Financial Institutions.
The resulting heatmap shows the material sectors in terms
of sensitivity to transition and physical climate risks and
lending exposure (please refer to Sustainability Risk in

the Risk, funding & capital review section). The scenario
analysis then focuses on measuring the actual climate risk
of our portfolios in these sectors. These scenario analyses
ocus on risk materialising both in the short term and the
ong term (up to 30 years).

Progress has also been made in implementing other
recommendations in the four TCFD pillars: governance,
strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.
nformation can be found on this throughout the report.
Please also refer to the Climate disclosure index in the
on-financial review in the Strategy & performance chapter.
As climate risk is defined in the ABN AMRO Taxonomy

as part of sustainability risk it falls under the responsibility
of the CRO. Further steps have been taken to integrate
the management of climate risk within the three lines

of defence model, impacting a broad variety of business
lines and functions. The imminent regulatory changes

will further contribute to setting the standard for climate
risk management, which will gradually be implemented

in the coming years.

Risk, funding & capital review

Risk profile

ABN AMRO aims to maintain a moderate risk profile. We
actively manage our business and balance sheet composition
to remain within our risk appetite.

Risk profile assessment

ABN AMRO periodically assesses its risk profile in conjunction
with the bank's risk appetite. The strategic Risk Appetite
Statement expresses ABN AMRO's strategy of pursuing a
moderate risk profile. The five elements of this strategic Risk
Appetite Statement ensure a coherent balance between

a sustainable return and value creation, our client centric
business model, capital, and liquidity and funding, taking into
account the conduct, governance and control framework. The
main conclusions of this assessment are summarised below.

Client-centric business model and sustainable return
and value creation

ABN AMRO focuses on growth, with a focus on clients
and sustainability, within the boundaries of our moderate
risk profile in order to achieve a healthy long-term, risk-
adjusted return. The bank aims to remain profitable even
under severe market conditions. The current economic
and monetary conditions, specifically developments relating
to Covid-19 and sustained low and negative interest rates,
are having an impact on global trade, current business and
margins and revenues.

Capital, liquidity and funding

Comfortable buffers are in place to meet capital and liquidity
requirements from a regulatory and internal (i.e. economic
capital) perspective. In addition, stress testing indicates
that sufficient buffers are in place for times of stress.

Conduct, governance and control framework

Capital buffers are also in place to cover non-financial risks.

In managing these risks, we face challenges regarding our

ability to fully comply with all regulatory requirements.

Specific areas where the risk of non-compliance with

regulations requires an ongoing and substantial effort are:

H Customer Due Diligence/Know Your Client, Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (CTF);

H Duty of care;

H Credit risk model management.

Over the past few years, the number of FTEs working on
DFC has increased to around 3,800. Regulatory compliance
risk is mitigated by ensuring staff remain aware of regulatory
programmes through ongoing training and presentations.

/ 88

Behavioural risk has also been introduced as a new risk

ype in our risk taxonomy.

n addition, the bank has to meet requirements in the field
of data aggregation and risk reporting that require a
substantial effort. These aspects of data management,
combined with issues regarding data quality and data
nowledge, may result in suboptimal decision-making and
business process execution, as well as in elevated model
risk and missed opportunities in the application of new
echnologies. A multi-year approach continues to be

required in order for the bank to reach the desired level.

Portfolio review

Total loans and advances decreased to EUR 254.8 billion
at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 270.4 billion).
All product groups contributed to this decrease, except
for other loans and advances. The largest decline was in
corporate loans, owing to the wind-down of the non-core
portfolio of Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) in line
with the CIB review announced in the second quarter of
2020. Residential mortgages decreased because redemptions
in 2020 exceeded the new production of mortgage loans.
Other loans and advances increased owing to higher cash
collateral demands within Clearing.

Exposure at Default

Exposure at Default (EAD) increased to EUR 4074 billion

(31 December 2019: EUR 393.2 billion) in relation to the
ECB's targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTRO).
ABN AMRO increased its participation in TLTRO to support
clients and their potential future needs due to Covid-19.

The EAD increase in Group Functions was offset by volume
declines in all other business lines, but mainly in CIB because
of the wind-down of the non-core portfolio.

Credit quality indicators

The credit quality indicators in 2020 were strongly impacted
by Covid-19. The forbearance ratio almost doubled compared
to last year, due to an inflow of forborne assets. These were
mainly generated by European corporate loans and to a lesser
extent by Dutch residential mortgages, for which loans with
a payment deferral were classified as forborne in Q3.

The past due ratio improved to 1.0% compared with
year-end 2019 (1.2%). Arrears decreased in all product
groups, but mainly in residential mortgages and to a lesser
extent in consumer and corporate loans. This decrease was
driven by short-term arrears and supported by Covid-19
circumstances (lower consumer spending and/or payment
holidays granted until 1 October 2020).

The stage 3 coverage ratio increased to 32.7% at yearend
2020 (2019: 29.6%). The increase was attributable to

the first half of the year, when all stage 3 CIB clients

were re-evaluated to assess the impact on them of the
outbreak of Covid-19. Increases in allowances were
recorded for existing stage 3 clients in the energy services
sector in CIB and in the food and shipping sectors in

CIB and CB. The stage 3 impaired ratio increased to 3.4%

to!persist into 2021, albeit with lower impairment levels than in 2020.

during 2020 (2019: 2.5%), with the main contribution being
attributable to the first half of the year. This was the result
of inflow from stage 2 within corporate loans. In addition,
decreasing total exposure as a result of the wind-down

of the non-core CIB portfolio contributed to the increase

in the stage 3 impaired ratio.

The impairment charges in 2020 amounted to

EUR 2,303 million (2019: EUR 657 million), resulting

in a cost of risk of 78bps. This was sharply higher than
the through-the-cycle cost of risk (25-30bps) and the
cost of risk in 2019 (24bps) and mainly attributable to
three large exceptional client files and the economic
impact of Covid-19 and oil price developments in 2020.
In addition, management overlays were recorded to
incorporate risks not fully captured by the outcomes of
our ECL models. We expect Covid-19 to continue affecting
impairment charges in 2021.

Regulatory capital

Total RWA increased to EUR 110.5 billion (81 December 2019:
EUR 109.8 billion) due to an increase in credit risk RWA
offset by a decrease in operational risk RWA. Market risk
RWA remained stable. The increase in credit risk was
predominantly driven by regulatory add-ons (partly TRIM)
and the introduction of the new definition of default. This
movement was partly offset by business developments,
largely related to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio
in CIB. Operational risk decreased in line with the declining
trend of operational losses and the removal of regulatory
capital add-ons.

Definition of default b

In Q2 2020, we implemented a uniform definition of default
(DoD) for all credit exposures except mortgages. The revised
DoD is accounted for as a change in accounting estimates
and recognised prospectively from 30 June 2020. The
implementation increased the total stage 3 exposure by
approximately EUR 0.3 billion and impairment allowances
by approximately EUR 28 million. As the credit risk models
have not yet been adjusted to the new default definition,

an RWA add-on of EUR 2.1 billion was taken. For mortgages,
we will apply a one-step approach, meaning that the

new definition and updated credit risk models will be
implemented simultaneously. Implementation of the updated
models depends on approval by the ECB. This is expected
in Q2 2021.

Economic capital
Economic capital (EC) increased to EUR 19.0 billion

(31 December 2019: EUR 18.2 billion) due to increases
in credit risk EC (EUR 1.2 billion) and market risk in the
banking book (MRBB) EC (EUR 0.4 billion), which were
offset by lower operational risk EC (EUR 0.4 billion)

and business risk EC (EUR 0.3 billion).

The increase in credit risk EC was predominantly driven by
add-ons mirrored by regulatory capital and the introduction
of the new definition of default. This movement was partly
offset by business developments, including those related to
the wind-down of the non-core portfolio in CIB. The increase
in EC for MRBB was mainly due to the higher EC for client
behaviour risk, driven by the decrease in the yield curve
compared to yearend 2019. Operational risk EC decreased
in line with the declining trend in operational losses and

the removal of regulatory capital add-ons. The decrease in
business risk EC was driven by the wind-down of non-core
CIB activities.

Liquidity and funding

The decrease in the loan-to-deposit (LtD) ratio was attributable
‘0 a decrease in loans and advances customers because

of a decline in the corporate loan book. Due to customers
increased, reflecting increased client savings in response

‘0 the impact of Covid-19. The consolidated LCR is reported
on the basis of a 12-month rolling average. The increase in
LCR reflects our participation in TLTRO III, a decreasing loan
book and an increasing deposit base.

Capital ratios

At 31 December 2020, the Basel II] Common Equity Tier 1
(CET1) ratio was 177%.The CET1 capital position decreased
compared to 31 December 2019, mainly driven by a capital
deduction of EUR 0.2 billion related to the regulatory
guidance on non-performing exposure (NPE) and, to a
lesser extent, by FX movements and the loss for 2020.

The leverage ratio increased to 5.0% (31 December 2019:
4.5%), mainly reflecting the temporary exemption of central
bank reserves from the exposure measure, partly offset

by a decline in Tier 1 capital.

Update on Covid-19

The impact of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdowns

in the Netherlands and other countries in which we are
active affected our processes and our clients. In response

‘0 these developments, we took a number of measures to
ensure we could continue providing services to our clients.
These measures included remote working, a sharp increase
in video banking, arranging for onboarding of new employees
0 be done virtually, and assisting our clients to absorb the
impact of the pandemic on their financial situation.

This section provides more details on the measures we
offered our clients to provide them with liquidity. It also
describes the way forward and the additional process
changes we made during the year. The two primary relief
measures we offered clients were Covid-19-related credit
facilities supported by public guarantee schemes, and
deferral of payments of interest and principal.

Loans and advances under public

guarantee schemes b

Clients facing short-term financial difficulties owing to
Covid-19 and who have exhausted their credit facilities

/ 93

can apply for government-supported loans based on the
terms and conditions set by the local or central government.
The final date for application varies depending on the type
of government-supported loan. For most of these loans,
clients could apply until 1 January 2021. For some others,
this will be possible until 1 April 2021. The guarantee covers
a significant share of the financial asset exposure. In return
for the credit guarantee, the client pays a fee to ABN AMRO,
which subsequently transfers the fee to the government (the
credit guarantor). The facilities provided in the Netherlands
include the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (BMKB-C)
scheme, the Corporate Finance Guarantee Scheme (GO-C)
and the small credit facility (Klein Krediet Corona, or KKC)
for the self-employed. Similar facilities are offered in other
countries in which we operate, most notably in France.

The demand for publicly guaranteed loans was relatively
low, primarily due to the extensive range of other support
measures made available by both the government and

the bank.

clients with a credit limit up to EUR 50 million
in Commercial Banking and Retail Banking;

The following table shows the number of clients and total

of payment was outstanding on 31 December 2020.

It includes EBA-compliant and non-EBA-compliant
moratoria and clients granted a grace period as an
individual forbearance measure. Active loans where

the moratorium has ended are reported as expired.

Most moratoria ended on 1 October 2020. For these loans,
no ‘cliff effect’ was observed and a significant number

of clients initiated repayment. The remaining payment
deferrals as at 31 December 2020 relate primarily to grace
periods provided in tailored forbearance solutions.

Repayment of relief measures

Automatic (opt-out) deferral

The opt-out deferral consisted primarily of Commercial
Banking clients whose interest deferral ended on 1 October
2020. To make sure that ending the payment holiday would
not lead to unforeseen financial difficulties, individual credit
risk assessments were made in Q3 2020. All clients with an
increased risk of non-repayment were classified as stage 2,
and clients with default triggers were transferred to stage
3. Deferred interest payments for current account and
overdraft facilities will be collected on 31 December 2021.
For loans, the deferred interest will be added to the final
repayment of principal. Deferred interest payments are not
interest-bearing. Deferred repayments of principal will be
added to the final repayment instalment of the loan, and
became interest-bearing on 1 October 2020.

Deferral upon request (opt-in)

Clients were able to apply for an opt-in measure until

1 October, which means the last of these measures

will end by 1 April 2021 at the latest. Repayments of
deferred payments on our mortgage loans started in
batches in October 2020 (with the next batches starting

in February and April 2021) and will be spread over 5 years
for 3-month deferrals, or 10 years if the period was extended
to 6 months. Other business lines have implemented
customised collection dates that vary depending on the
product or client.

Measures to mitigate Covid-19 impact

As at 1 October 2020 we decided not to continue providing
collective measures, but instead to offer tailored measures
to clients affected by Covid-19. The measures we offer
carefully assess the viability of the client’s business and the
resilience of the relevant sector to the economic challenges
posed by Covid-19.

In addition to adopting a customised approach, we took
measures to limit the adverse effects of Covid-19 on our
clients and the bank. In the loan origination process for new
clients we introduced extra checks to assess the resilience
of the client’s economic sector, while we are also applying
stricter acceptance criteria for people on temporary contracts
and the self-employed. In the case of mortgage applications,

we have added Covid-19-related questions to reflect

the client's situation in the current circumstances.

Lastly, all clients with an increased risk of non-repayment
were Classified as stage 2 and clients with default triggers
were transferred to stage 3 during the year.

Impact of relief measures on credit risk
measurement b

The objective, scope and conditions of the relief measures
co-determine how the regulatory framework should be
applied in this context. Where relevant, application of the
appropriate risk classification (e.g. forbearance, default or
stage shifts) reflects recently issued supervisory guidance.
The impact of the various relief measures on these risk
classifications is explained in the credit risk section.

Impact of Covid-19 on determining SICR

Assets with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)
since initial recognition are classified in stage 2. Covid-19
significantly impacted some of the SICR triggers, mainly
forbearance and watch. To account for the widespread
impact of Covid-19 on credit risk, we temporarily added
the industry sector of the client as an additional qualitative
trigger. This section explains the relationship between
Covid-19 and these three SICR triggers. The quantitative
impact of Covid-19 on our risk classifications is presented
in the credit risk section.

Forbearance

Forbearance applies to all individual clients with a liquidity
need or who are facing financial difficulties and are offered
borrowerspecific arrangements to ensure they have
sufficient liquidity to return to a healthy financial situation.
Opt-out measures do not in themselves trigger forbearance.
nstead, opt-in measures are assessed on a client level to
establish whether the specific client is experiencing

inancial difficulties, and subsequently if the forbearance
status is applicable.

pa

Watch

Besides the normal review process ABN AMRO performed
additional actions to ensure correct risk classification.
These included additional client reviews, primarily of clients
granted a payment moratorium. The outcome of these

client reviews led primarily to changes in the watch
status of clients, but also to changes in forbearance
or default status.

Additional qualitative trigger: Industry sector

Covid-19 developments and the government measures
resulted in the economic outlook for specific subsectors
changing rapidly. Each month, therefore, ABN AMRO
identified the subsectors with an SICR. All clients in the
subsectors with an elevated risk were transferred to stage 2,
except for clients that had opted out of the payment holiday
scheme. The increase in ECL that resulted from these stage
overrides was recorded as a management overlay.

Modification in relation to relief measures

Relief measures provided by ABN AMRO, including
payment moratoria, may result in modification of

a financial asset. Deferred collection of payments without
compound interest being charged on the delay will have

a negative impact on the net present value of a financial
asset. If a financial asset is modified, its gross carrying
amount is recalculated, based on the net present value

of the modified or renegotiated contractual cash flows.
These are then discounted at the financial asset's original
effective interest rate and accounted for as an adjustment
of the financial asset's gross carrying value. The effect is
recognised as a modification loss in the income statement.
As relief measures relating to Covid-19 have not resulted
in substantial modification, the financial assets have not
been derecognised.

Total credit risk RWA increased to EUR 92.5 billion
(31 December 2019: EUR 89.1 billion), primarily because
of regulatory add-ons and changed methodology (mainly

the definition of default). This increase was partly offset by
the decline in business volumes, mostly in CIB, and fewer
overdue models.

Credit quality by exposure class b

The increase in EAD in the investment grade portfolio is
mainly visible in the exposure class of central governments
and central banks, and primarily attributable to our
participation in the TLTRO III facility. This increase was partly
offset by lower exposure to corporates and institutions

/ 99

mainly due to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio in
CIB. This also explains the decrease in the sub-investment
grade portfolio. The increase in the impaired portfolio was
largely attributable to inflow in the corporate portfolio in
both Commercial Banking and CIB.

The largest part of our portfolio is classified in the highest
and medium internal ratings of stage 1. Stage 2 clients are
primarily in the medium internal UCRs, primarily visible for
mortgages loans and corporate loans. Compared to 2019,
the share of the portfolio with an investment grade increased
marginally, mainly due to lower total exposure attributable
to the decrease in sub-investment grade clients in CIB’s
non-core corporate loans. In addition, payment moratoria
and government support measures had a positive effect on
clients’ payment behaviour. UCR 6+ is also the default
rating for clients that are being revised until a new rating is
available. The impact of Covid-19 on the stage movements
and the measures taken by the bank are explained in more
detail in the information on coverage and stage ratios.

The exposures in the table below have been classified
on the basis of the geographical regions where clients
are domiciled. The bank monitors and manages country
risk based on the country at risk. The country at risk may
be different from the country of domicile, for example

if the bank finances a project in a country other than

the country in which the borrower is domiciled. The bank
actively manages and monitors the development of its
country risk exposures.

ABN AMR®Mnnual Report 2020

The EAD concentrated in the Netherlands increased

to 75.1% of the bank's portfolio in 2020 (2019: 70.9%).
EAD in the Netherlands increased to EUR 303.7 billion at
31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: EUR 276.3 billion)
as a result of the ECB’s TLTRO to support clients and
potential future needs arising because of Covid-19. This
increase is reflected in central governments and central
banks. All other regions showed declines in EAD, largely
attributable to the wind-down of the non-core CIB portfolio.
Businesses outside the Netherlands are primarily located in
neighbouring countries in Europe. Clearing and Securities
Financing are also located outside Europe. The non-core
CIB portfolio is also partly located outside Europe.

Industry concentration
ABN AMRO applies industry concentration limits in line
with the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB). In the
exposure table, non-material industry clusters are aggregated
under Other. Industry concentration limits are established

Industry concentration by EAD b

/ 102

within the bank’s risk appetite, with the thresholds for
concentrations being based on relative risk, the importance
of the industry to the Dutch economy and expert opinion.

Industry concentration is presented both in terms of

the original obligor and the resultant obligor. The original
obligor is the counterparty (often referred to as the
borrower) with whom ABN AMRO has the original
contractual relationship. The resultant obligor is the
counterparty bearing the ultimate credit risk and is often
referred to as the guarantor. The industry classification

of the original obligor may differ from that of the resultant
obligor in, for example, the real estate, healthcare and public
administration sectors. While government-guaranteed
exposures are included in the applicable industry in the
original obligor view, these exposures are included in public
administration in the resultant obligor view as they entail
government-related exposures.

+ Net exposure represents the portfolio corrected for the surplus amount and gives a view on the potential shortfall in collateral on the total portfolio.

Collateral and guarantees for credit-impaired assets (stage 3)
represent credit risk mitigation based on the NCV for clients
in default. The carrying amount includes expected credit
loss allowances, based on the probability-weighted present
value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining

life of the financial instrument for both on- and off-balance
sheet exposures. The Financial Restructuring & Recovery
department identifies the most likely scenarios for non-
programme lending defaulted clients (going concern or
gone concern) and, using its professional judgement,

the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows.

This explains why a net exposure remains after collateral
pledged to the bank is taken into account.

In line with the increase in the stage 3 carrying amount
to EUR 5.7 billion (31 December 2019: EUR 4.7 billion),
total risk mitigation increased to EUR 6.1 billion in 2020
(31 December 2019: EUR 5.2 billion). This increase was
observed in property and equipment, other collateral and
guarantees, and financial instruments. Property and
equipment moved up for corporate loans and residential
mortgages. The movement in property and equipment

for corporate loans was due to increases in corporate and
commercial real estate from Commercial Banking clients,
partly offset by a decrease in moveable property and
equipment from CIB clients. In the case of residential
mortgages, the increase was due to indexation. The main
reason why other collateral and guarantees moved up was
higher intangibles and other non-financial collateral from
CIB clients in the United States. Financial instruments in
corporate loans recorded higher collateral in the form of
receivables from Asset-Based Finance clients. As the increase
in total risk mitigation partly included surplus collateral, net
exposure increased by EUR 176 million to EUR 835 million
at 31 December 2020.

During 2020 ABN AMRO obtained property and equipment
by taking possession of collateral held as security for

loans and advances. The total amount of such assets held
on 31 December 2020 amounted to EUR 3 million (2019:
EUR 4 million). ABN AMRO does not intend to use these
assets in its operations and will pursue timely and orderly
realisation of the collateral.

Overall, the past due ratio for loans and advances
customers improved to 1.0% compared with yearend 2019
(1.2%). Total past due exposure declined to EUR 2.6 billion
compared with yearend 2019 (EUR 3.2 billion). Arrears
decreased in all product groups, but mainly in residential
mortgages and to a lesser extent in consumer loans and
corporate loans. The decrease in past due exposure was
driven by short-term arrears and supported by Covid-19

circumstances (including lower consumer spending and/or
payment holidays granted in the period to 1 October 2020).

The decrease in short-term arrears was partly offset by

increases in mid- and long-term arrears (>30-90 and >90
days respectively), which were related mainly to corporate
loans and more specifically to some larger Asset-Based

Finance clients in Commercial Banking.

The stage 3 impaired ratio increased to 3.4% in 2020
(2019: 2.5%). This was the result of inflow from stages 1
and 2 in corporate loans. In addition to stage migrations,
the increase in the stage 3 impaired ratio was caused by

a net decrease in exposure to corporate loans in the other
stages, partly as a result of the wind-down of the non-core

CIB portfolio.

The stage 3 coverage ratio increased to 32.7% at yearend
2020 (2019: 29.6%). In response to the outbreak of the
Covid-19 pandemic, all stage 3 corporate clients were
re-evaluated which resulted in increases in allowances.
Increases for existing stage 3 clients were mainly recorded
in the energy services sector, while the stage 3 coverage
ratio also rose because of increases for new inflow and
existing clients in the food and shipping sectors in CIB

and CB.

As a result of measures taken to mitigate the economic
impact of Covid-19, the stage 2 ratio increased to 10.2%
(2019: 6.4%). All credit portfolios were reviewed to identify
any significant increase in credit risk in the context of IFRS 9.
This resulted in an increase in stage 2 exposure, mainly

in corporate loans. At the start of Covid-19, several sub-
sectors within Commercial Banking were identified as
having a significant increased credit risk and were therefore
transferred to stage 2. In the subsequent months, this
subsectorbased assessment was replaced by individual
assessments. For Retail Banking, identification of significant
increased credit risk was initially carried out by profession.

/ iil

During the second half of 2020, this assessment, too,
was replaced by individual assessments.

The stage 2 coverage ratio increased to 1.6% in 2020

(2019: 1.5%). This was mainly the result of management
overlays , which were taken in Commercial Banking for risks
not fully captured by the risk parameters, and in CIB for risk
costs related to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio.
Without management overlays, the stage 2 coverage ratio
for corporate loans would have been 1.2% at yearend 2020
(2019: 1.3%). The increase in the stage 1 coverage ratio

for corporate loans to 0.4% (2019: 0.2%) was also entirely
related to management overlays.

The stage 2 coverage ratios for consumer loans and
residential mortgages decreased at year-end 2020,

both mainly as a result of decreased management overlays.
For residential mortgages, a release was recorded for the
total management overlay for interest-only mortgages.

For consumer loans, there was a transfer of service loans
to both stage 1 and stage 3 during the year. This resulted

in a release of the management overlay in stage 2,

and therefore in a decrease in the coverage ratio.

All clients in subsectors with elevated risk in Commercial
Banking that had not yet been individually assessed
were Classified in stage 2. Identification of subsectors
with increased credit risk takes place on a monthly basis.

For residential mortgages, a management overlay to

cover the refinancing risk of interest-only mortgages was
continued. The overlays in consumer loans amounted to
EUR 33 million and related mostly to clients with forbearance
measures. All management overlays represent best estimates
of the risks involved. Underlying reasoning and calculations
are documented and discussed and approved by the
Impairments and Provisioning Committee (IPC).

Macroeconomic scenarios and ECL sensitivity

The calculation of the ECL takes three economic scenarios
into account, each of which contains estimates for a large
number of macroeconomic variables. The relative weighting
of individual variables in the calculation depends on the
actor loading in the ECL models and on the projected
values in the scenarios. For corporates, the most influential
macroeconomic variable in terms of expected credit loss is
Dutch GDP growth, while the risk profile of Retail Banking
is most affected by changes in affordability (for example,
he unemployment rate) and collateral values (for example,
house prices).

The tables show the scenarios used for calculating the
ECL. To reflect the more negative economic outlook
following the stricter Covid-19 measures imposed by
he Dutch government in the fourth quarter of 2020,

he weighting of the negative scenario was increased to

Macroeconomic scenarios in 2020 b

40% on 31 December 2020. The scenarios themselves are
also strongly influenced by recent developments relating to
Covid-19. The second wave of registered cases led to new
nationwide lockdowns, which will have a negative impact
on growth. A new ‘British’ strain and vaccine supply
disruptions in Q1 will delay the lifting of restrictions and
have lowered our growth forecast for the first half of 2021.
Once half of the population over 50 years old has been
vaccinated, restrictions can be wound down, and this will
ead to a stronger rebound in the second half. As we expect
government measures to remain dynamic and dependent
on the economic situation, we have assumed the impact

‘0 be constant.

Unemployment estimates for 2021 are significantly higher
han in the 2019 scenarios, but in the final quarter of 2020
we became slightly more positive on the labour market.
The wage cost subsidy (NOVV) provided by the Dutch
government has been continued in order to limit the
number of lay-offs. This measure has proven to be very
effective in dampening the adverse effects on the labour
market and we expect the stimulus package to continue
under the same conditions until at least the second quarter
of Q2 2021.

So far the economic downturn has not led to lower house
prices. House prices are supported by the low interest rate
environment and uninterrupted credit supply. Forecasts are
based on very detailed analyses of the Covid-19 situation.
However, the uncertainty surrounding these projections
currently remains very high.

The forborne portfolio is mainly concentrated in the
Netherlands. The increase here was primarily driven
by the inflow of performing forborne corporate loans
and residential mortgages. The increase in the rest of
Europe and in the United States was related mainly
to new performing forborne corporate loans in CIB
and to a lesser extent in Commercial Banking.

The Netherlands contributed the most to the decline in past
due but not stage 3 exposures, mainly due to a decrease in
domestic residential mortgages. This movement was partly
offset by the movement in the rest of Europe, which related
mainly to the inflow of Asset-Based Finance clients from

8,070 1,993

the UK. In addition, Asia past due exposure decreased
as result of the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.

In 2020, impaired exposures and allowances increased in

all geographies except Rest of the world. A relatively large
increase in exposure and impairment charges was observed
in the United States as a result of inflow from stage 2

in the energy sectors. Increases in impaired exposures

and allowances in the Netherlands were attributed to new
inflow from stages 1 and 2, mainly in the food and shipping
sectors in commercial banking and CIB, partly offset by
write-offs. The increase in Asia was attributable to an
exceptional client file in Singapore in Q1 2020.

ABN AMR®Mnnual Report 2020

Broken down by industry, the increase in forborne assets
in the industrial goods and services sector was primarily
generated by the inflow of performing forborne corporate
oans in CIB. The increase in the other sector was mainly
caused by the inflow of performing forborne corporate
oans in the travel and leisure sector in CIB and Commercial
Banking. The addition of forborne loans in the private
individuals sector was attributable to the mortgage loans

or which a payment deferral had been granted and which
were therefore classified as forborne in Q3.

Private individuals, supported by Covid-19 circumstances
(lower consumer spending and/or payment holidays granted
ill 1 October 2020), were the main drivers of the decline

in past due but not stage 3 exposures. This decline was
partly offset by increases in industrial goods and services
and retail.

Impaired exposures increased strongly during 2020. The
main contributions were attributable to the oil and gas and
food and beverage sectors, where increases were observed
mainly for existing stage 3 clients. Smaller contributions
came from the travel and leisure (included in other) and real
estate sectors, where new inflow in stage 3 exposure was

observed in 2020. The healthcare sector benefited from
releases in both credit-impaired exposures for credit losses
and allowances. These were attributable to a few larger files
in Commercial Banking.

Developments in specific portfolios
The following section provides a more detailed overview
of developments in specific portfolios and products.

Residential mortgages

The Dutch housing market is being impacted by a shortage
of homes available for sale. Despite Covid-19, residential
property prices continued to rise as a result of consumer
confidence, the housing shortage and low interest rates.
The housing price index published by Statistics Netherlands
(CBS) at the end of 2020 was 8.4% higher than at the end
of 2019. Overall price levels in December 2020 (not adjusted
for inflation) were 20.8% higher than before the global
financial crisis. According to the Land Registry, the number
of transactions in the Dutch housing market in 2020

was 8.5% higher than in 2019. This was 2.6% lower

than the peak seen in 2017, but still well above the 10-year
moving average.

The residential mortgage portfolio decreased by 1.7%
to EUR 145.7 billion in 2020 (31 December 2019:

EUR 148.2 billion) as redemptions exceeded new
production of mortgage loans. ABN AMRO's market
share of new mortgage production in 2020 came out
at 15.3% (2019: 178%) as we maintained strict pricing

discipline in a competitive market. The proportion of
amortising mortgages continued to increase, totalling 37%
at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 33%). Total
redemptions were 15% higher than in 2019. Contractual
redemptions gradually increased, in line with changes in the
portfolio composition. Extra repayments in 2020 amounted

to EUR 2.2 billion, a decrease of 13% compared with

2019. The share of mortgages covered by the National
Mortgage Guarantee (NHG) scheme decreased slightly
compared with 31 December 2019, from 24% to 23%.

Regulatory capital

The RWA for the residential mortgage portfolio decreased
to EUR 16.5 billion (2019: EUR 16.7 billion). The decrease
in the RWA was mainly due to a decrease in exposure.
Exposure at default (EAD) decreased to EUR 163.8 billion
(2019: EUR 164.6 billion).

Credit quality indicators

In general, the credit quality indicators for residential
mortgages improved in line with the performance of

the Dutch housing market. The past due ratio decreased,
mainly due to the limited inflow into past due exposures
in short-term arrears. Affordability of mortgages remained
good this year due to the government's Covid-19 support
measures in combination with lower consumer spending.
The coverage ratio decreased as a result of improved credit
quality and higher collateral values. The stage 3 exposure
increased as a result of the UTP trigger regarding clients
with interest-only mortgages and the high refinancing risk
at maturity. The forborne ratio increased owing to Covid-19
payment holidays.

Rising housing prices and restrictions set for the maximum
loan-to-market value (LtMV) of new mortgages led to
further improvements in the underlying average indexed
LtMV, both guaranteed and unguaranteed.

The long-term LtMV of the bank's portfolio is expected to
decrease further as a combined result of rising housing

prices, contractual and extra redemptions, and the gradual
reduction in mortgage interest tax relief.

at yearend 2020 (2019: EUR 2.2 billion). Note that LtMVs

in excess of 100% do not necessarily indicate that these

comprised 26.1% interest-only, 678% redeeming mortgages
and 0.8% savings mortgages. Interest-only and savings
mortgages can still be produced for clients who want

‘0 refinance loans originated before 2013. The majority

of the interest-only inflow is part of a mixed mortgage.

Commercial real estate (CRE)

The Dutch commercial real estate (investment) market
shrank in 2020 due to the economic uncertainty caused
by Covid-19 and the negative implications for various asset
ypes. A total of EUR 179 billion was invested in 2020.
This was a decrease of 172% compared with 2019 and

he first decline in 10 years. The number of transactions
(rental and buying) also decreased in 2020, by 20.9%.

Demand for office space is declining due to the economic
contraction, rising unemployment and the work-from-home
trend triggered by Covid-19. Although the number of
transactions declined rapidly in 2020, most of the negative
effects will be visible in 2021. Lower demand for office
space will in future create scope for transforming offices
into residential space.

The residential market is a late-cyclical market. Private
rental prices consequently continued rising by 0.2% in
2020, but the growth rate is declining. The residential
market will be affected by consumers’ lower disposable
income and by rising unemployment. This will put pressure
on rents and on the value of residential buildings, although
demand for private rental properties remains high due

to rising house prices, stricter rules on mortgage lending,
a lack of new-builds, and more limited access to rental
properties in the social housing sector.

The industrial market benefited in 2020 from the strong rise
in e-commerce. Although this trend had already been visible
in the past few years, it gained momentum due to retail
premises being closed in order to get Covid-19 under control.
At the same time, the continuing rise of e-commerce is
putting pressure on the retail market, which is struggling.
As a result, vacancy rates for retail properties are increasing.

Commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio

In Q2 2020, we redefined the scope of our CRE portfolio in
line with EBA guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.
The CRE portfolio includes all loans aimed at acquiring CRE
property or secured by CRE property, whereby CRE means
any income-producing real estate, either existing or under
development or renovation. It excludes social housing,

a market value of EUR 2 million and unsecured general
purpose lending. The credit exposure relating to the above
definition is monitored on a quarterly basis and subject

to an EAD limit.

Adjusted for the new definition, the EAD increased

to EUR 12.9 billion in 2020 (2019: EAD 12.2 billion).

The stage 3 impaired ratio increased moderately to 3.5%
(31 December 2019: 1.5%) as a result of Covid-19. The
increase in the impairment rate was mainly visible for

retail properties. The CRE loan portfolio is largely based on
Dutch properties and consists primarily of investment loans
that are well diversified across different asset types.

' Other asset types include mixed real estate and properties in the hospitality and parking industries.

Market risk in the banking book

Market risk in the banking book is the risk that the bank’s

value or income declines because of unfavourable market
movements. The market risk in the banking book consists
predominantly of interest rate risk and credit spread risk in

the liquidity portfolio.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk arises from holding assets such as
with interest rate maturities that are different from the

oans

interest rate maturities of liabilities, such as deposits. The
assets have a longer average maturity than the liabilities.

This applies to contractual as well as behavioural maturities.

ABN AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro)
hedges and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges to
swap fixed interest rates for floating interest rate positions.

The resulting interest rate position, after application of
interest rate hedges, is in line with the bank’s strategy

and risk appetite.

Nll-at-Risk is the difference in net interest income (NII)
between a base scenario and four alternative scenarios.

It is defined as the worst outcome of the following
scenarios: gradual increase or decrease in interest rates by
200bps and instantaneous increase or decrease of 100bps.
All scenarios are measured over a time horizon of one year.
Nll-at-Risk covers all expected cash flows, including

commercial margins and other spread components, from
interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and off-balance
sheet items in the banking book. Nll-at-Risk figures

of December 2020 are calculated assuming balance sheet
developments in line with corporate planning. For the
Nll-at-Risk calculated in December 2019, portfolio volumes
were assumed to be static. Floors on the markets rates
and specific products are applied. The interest rate floors
define how low ABN AMRO assumes interest rates to

go and consequently impact the downward scenarios
used in Nll-at-Risk. ABN AMRO periodically reviews

the level of these interest rate floors.

The Nil-at-Risk in December 2020 increased to -1.6%

and reflects a reduction of NII in the scenario of a gradual
decrease in interest rates by 200bps. The scenario with

the worst outcome for NII differs from December 2019,
which was an instantaneous decrease of interest rates by
100bps. The most positive NII occurs for the scenario where
interest rates rise gradually by 200bps, in which NII would
decrease from 5.6% to 4.6%, or an Nll-at-Risk of -1.0%.

Pv01

PVO1 measures value changes resulting from a 1bp parallel
shift of the yield curve. For internal risk management,
shocks on individual maturities and larger shocks are also
applied. PVO1 exposure decreased by EUR 3.1 million in
2020. This decrease was due to various developments in
markets and the balance sheet (such as the increase in
saving deposits), which partially resulted from Covid-19
developments. ABN AMRO actively manages interest rate
risk to keep it within the risk appetite.

Foreign exchange risk b

ABN AMRO monitors its foreign exchange risk through

the bank's aggregated open currency position (OCP).

The most material single open foreign exchange exposures
are GBP and USD. The OCP position remained relatively
stable throughout 2020.

Market risk exposure

ABN AMRO applies a diversified portfolio VaR approach.
This takes into account the fact that returns across risk
factors may offset one another to a certain extent and
consequently reduce risk. As long as these returns are
not perfectly correlated to one another, VaR figures based
on a diversified portfolio approach will be lower than

if the figures are calculated using undiversified VaR.

Undiversified VaR means that the VaR figures computed
for the different risk factors are summed up without taking
into account any offset across risk factors, and therefore
negates the potential for risk reduction.

The following graph shows the total 1-day VaR at a 99%
confidence level (‘VaR diversified’) and aggregation of the
stand-alone risk factors (‘VaR undiversified’).

the average VaR observed from 2019 to 2020 was driven

by the market volatility observed in H1 2020, which resulted
from Covid-19. The increasing effect of market volatility on
VaR is partially offset by reduced positions.

RWA for market risk was EUR 1.3 billion (2019: EUR 1.4 billion).
The RWA decrease was due to a decline in the stressed
VaR, which was mainly driven by position changes. The
effect of the Stressed VaR on market risk RWA was partially
offset by an increase in the VaR, which was mainly driven
by model changes, i.e. the increased market volatility in

he 300-day VaR window.

IBOR Reform

n 2014, at the request of the G20, the Financial Stability
Board issued a report on ‘Reforming Major Interest Rate
Benchmarks’. This report set out several recommendations
or strengthening existing benchmarks for key interbank
offered rates (IBORs) in unsecured lending markets, and
or promoting the development and adoption of alternative
nearly risk-free reference rates, where appropriate. These
recommendations led to a fundamental review of the key
interest rate benchmarks used in global financial markets.

/ 124

In 2020, public authorities in various jurisdictions continued
to make progress on reforming or replacing the existing
benchmarks. In order to ensure a smooth transition,

ABN AMRO introduced a bank-wide project, under the
responsibility of the CFO and led by ALM and Treasury,

to prepare the bank for the forthcoming changes in IBORs.
This project includes senior representatives from all
relevant functions across the bank. During 2020, the bank
successfully completed the switch in the discounting
regime for centrally cleared swaps. The change in the
discounting regime for bilateral counterparties was also
started during the year and will continue in 2021. The
preparations made as part of the project and the changes
already executed give confidence that the changes required
in 2021, such as moving away from LIBOR, will be able

to be executed successfully. For other benchmark interest
rates, such as EURIBOR, that have been reformed and

can therefore continue, financial instruments referencing
those rates will not need to transition.

Operational (non-financial) risk

Operational risk by risk type

Operational losses include direct losses as well as provisions
for legal claims. Net operational loss may be negative,
meaning provisions formed in the past are released when
no payments are ultimately made to claimants. Losses are
reported according to event categories such as External
Fraud; Internal Fraud; Clients, Products & Business
Practices; Execution, Delivery & Process Management;
Employee Practices & Workplace Safety; Disaster & Public
Safety, and Technology & Infrastructure Failures.

An overall negative net operational loss was recorded in
2020 due to a combination of released provisions and lower
losses in some event categories. There were significant
releases of provisioned legal claims in the event categories
of External Fraud (including forgery, skimming and phishing)
and Clients, Products & Business Practices (including
disputes with clients). Secondly, losses due to External
Fraud and Clients, Products & Business Practices were
significantly lower than in 2019. In addition, the number

of attacks on ABN AMRO ATMs in 2020 was 3, compared

(0 52 in 2019.

The highest total net loss in 2020 was recorded in the event
category of Execution, Delivery & Process Management.

This primarily consisted of one large loss incurred as a
result of a flaw in execution. This loss also caused total loss
in this event category to be slightly higher than in 2019.
Risk awareness and continued strengthening of controls
are helping to limit these losses.

Similarly, the net loss for Employee Practices & Workplace
Safety increased compared to 2019. This category includes
a provision formed for arbitration proceedings initiated by
the pension fund in relation to the renewed collective labour
agreement.

IT & Cyber risk

Remote capabilities for clients, vendors and employees were
implemented on a large scale in 2020 as a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic. Digital signing and video conferencing,
for example, enabled ABN AMRO to continue offering a
seamless service to clients. Similarly, our staff were able to
work remotely as a result of our enhanced network capacity.

IT transformation continued through the adoption of

Cloud services and DevOps ways of working. These were
accompanied by improvements to safeguard ABN AMRO’'s
overall security position against evolving threats (such as
phishing and ransomware) and ensure regulatory compliance.
We also devoted great efforts to ensuring the overall
stability of our digital payment services and maintaining

the operating effectiveness of our risk and control
framework. Enhanced Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
capabilities helped to mitigate incidents and limit disruption.

With our transition to open banking (PSD2), customer data
(such as transactions and balances) can be aggregated,
transferred, stored and used in a third party's infrastructure.
This is associated with an increased risk profile for

ABN AMRO'’s cyber security as it increases the attack
surface for potential threats. We are continuously updating
our risk management architecture to repel these threats.

Overall, information risk management remains a prominent

area of attention for senior management and our supervisor.

The robustness of the control environment, stability and
availability of systems, and the underlying infrastructure
and architecture are focus points both for strengthening
our cyber posture and future-proofing our organisation.

Stability of digital services

The availability of the bank's internet banking services
during prime time was an average of 99.82% in 2020,
compared to 99.90% in 2019. Availability was impacted
by a few operational incidents in 2020 that caused the
bank to underperform the WfT norm on some occasions.
However, these incidents were fully resolved and used
as input for further improvements to processes and
underlying systems.

ATM attacks

Although the number of attacks on ABN AMRO ATMs
and seal bag machines decreased in 2020, these acts

of criminality continue to pose risks to society as a whole
as the use of heavy-duty explosives impact on the safety
of people living near an ATM. ABN AMRO is continuing
to work with the Dutch Banking Association and other
relevant authorities to implement countermeasures.

Business continuity

Business continuity management (BCM) is a core part

of our risk management framework. BCM respects the
bank's three lines of defence model and is embedded in
business and support functions, subsidiaries and countries.
Mitigations such as business continuity plans, crisis
management, business relocation plans and IT disaster
recovery plans are in place to prepare for and deal with
incidents and crises threatening the continuity of critical
business processes. Evaluations and root cause analyses
are also performed to analyse incidents and implement
lessons learned.

ABN AMR®Mnnual Report 2020

During 2020 ABN AMRO'’s crisis management organisation
proved able to respond adequately to the ongoing Covid-19
pandemic. Our measures, including large-scale working
from home, reflected our twofold priority to protect employee
safety and ensure business continuity. Nevertheless, these
measures concurrently resulted in a higher reliance on
remote access and therefore in elevated risks regarding
network stability and cyber security. We are continuing

to proactively manage these risks to business continuity

in line with developments in the Netherlands and other
geographies relevant to our businesses and operations.

Change risk
An increasingly high pace of change is necessary to achieve
our strategic ambitions and deliver on stakeholders’
expectations. To this end, the 2020 strategy review focused
on rigorously simplifying the product landscape and
centralising the operating model. This will further support
the bank's efforts to better serve its clients and work more
efficiently. Against this backdrop, change management has
become an even more important pillar of ABN AMRO’s risk
management framework. In 2020, we therefore matured
our change management framework by implementing a
new change management policy, together with enhanced
key risk indicators (KRIs), standards and agile practice
guides, and strengthened governance.

Data management
Data management remained within the purview of both
senior management and local stakeholders during 2020.
ABN AMRO made further steps to strengthen its data
management capabilities by introducing a data governance
policy, a Joint Master Plan on data and more granular data
quality reporting. These were important milestones in our
multi-year approach to improve the data management
framework. ABN AMRO fully recognises that inadequate
data management poses significant risks to innovation,
risk management and decision-making, as well as to
regulatory compliance.

/ 126

Compliance risk

As reconfirmed in the update of the bank's strategy, our
licence to operate and our culture remain clear priorities,
also for the Compliance function. ABN AMRO has been
making progress in enhancing its Compliance function
and ‘trust by design’. Management of compliance risk
across the organisation is one of Risk Management's
priorities that translates into further enhancement of the
Compliance function on the basis of continuing structural
improvements and a focus on the stature, permanence
and maturity of the function.

Regulatory capital
Operational risk RWA calculated using the Advanced
Measurement Approach (AMA) decreased in 2020 to

EUR 16.7 billion (2019: EUR 19.4 billion). This outcome

was partly explained by a continued trend of declining
operational risk losses. The decrease was also attributable
to the removal of regulatory capital add-ons. In 2020, the
vast majority of the ECB’s findings on the capital calculation
process were resolved by ABN AMRO, and this meant the
associated capital add-ons could be removed.

ABN AMRO'’s current operational risk capital level (15%

of gross income) is still relatively conservative compared
with peer banks with a moderate risk profile (14% of gross
income, based on ORX benchmark data).

Maturity calendar

We target a maturity profile where redemptions of
funding instruments are well spread over time. The average
remaining maturity of newly issued wholesale funding
increased to 8.6 years at yearend 2020 (8.4 years at
year-end 2019), not taking into account other long-term
funding. The average remaining maturity of outstanding
long-term funding decreased to 4.6 years at yearend 2020
(down from 4.8 years at year-end 2019). The maturity
calendar assumes redemption on the earliest possible

call date or the legal maturity date, which does not mean
that the instruments will be called at the earliest possible
call date. Early redemption of subordinated instruments

is subject to approval by the regulator.

Main developments in capital position

We set out our updated capital framework at the Investor
Update of November 2020, despite various uncertainties.
This updated framework reflects regulatory developments
as well as the current environment and our strategy.

We continue to report on and comply with Basel Ill as
current solvency requirements are based on Basel Ill.
However, according to the Basel Committee, Basel IV

is to be implemented by January 2023. Since Basel IV
requirements are more onerous and imminent, we have
adopted Basel IV as our primary capital metric, with a
Basel IV CET1 target ratio of 13%.

At 31 December 2020, the Basel II] Common Equity Tier 1

(CET1), Tier 1 and total capital ratios were 177%, 19.5%,

and 23.7% respectively (December 2019: 18.1%, 19.9%
and 25.9% respectively). The CET1 capital position
decreased compared to 31 December 2019, mainly driven
by a capital deduction of EUR 0.2 billion related to the
regulatory guidance on non-performing exposure (NPE)
and, to a lesser extent, by FX movements and the yearto-
date loss over 2020. The final dividend for 2019 remains
reserved as dividend and has not been included in the
CET1 capital (inclusion in CET1 capital would result in a pro
forma CET1 ratio of 18.3%). All capital ratios were in line
with the bank's risk appetite and were comfortably above
regulatory requirements.

The targeted review of internal models (TRIM) has become
much clearer, given that we have received the final TRIM
letter for advanced IRB models applied to corporate
exposures. The final two draft TRIM letters for commodities,
as well as for banks and financial institutions, have also
been received. Since 04 2018, we have recorded
approximately EUR 21 billion of RWA add-ons in respect

of TRIM, model reviews and the new definition of default.

The TRIM process is finalising. In the upcoming quarters,
further increases in RWA may be required as the final
outcomes of two draft TRIM letters are expected and
models (including mortgage models) are reviewed.

The risk weight floor for mortgages announced by DNB,
which could further increase Basel II RVVA for mortgages,
has been postponed until further notice.

We have updated our CET1 target ratio to 13% under Basel IV.
This consists of a management buffer on top of our SREP
capital requirement and Pillar 2 guidance. Based on our
interpretation of the Basel IV framework and on our
expectation of how Basel IV standards will be implemented
in EU legislation, the fully-loaded Basel IV CET1 ratio was
estimated to be above 15% on 31 December 2020,
comfortably above target. The assumptions applied in our
calculations will be updated once we have more information
on EU implementation. Basel IV calculations are also subject
to uncertainties stemming from data limitations, management
actions and other portfolio developments (including the
wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio). The first effects
of measures implemented to mitigate Basel IV inflation are
visible in the RWA and we are continuing to work on further
mitigations to reduce the Basel IV RWA inflation.

The wind-down of the non-core portfolio in CIB is
progressing steadily, contributing to our current strong
capital ratios under Basel Ill and Basel IV and strengthening
our future outlook. The finalisation of TRIM for corporates
and the draft TRIM letter for commodities and for banks and
financial institutions provided us with more clarity on the
TRIM impact. However, we are currently also encountering
a number of capital headwinds and uncertainties, including
elevated impairments due to Covid-19, the low interest
rate environment, the final TRIM outcome and model
reviews, EU implementation of Basel IV, the AML
investigation and the NPE calendar provisioning.

We continue to expect regulatory capital headwinds

from the industry-wide non-performing exposure (NPE)
guidance and minimum coverage levels for the existing
stock of NPEs expected by the supervisory authorities.

In Q2 2019, we recorded a supervisory capital deduction

of around EUR 0.2 billion. An additional capital deduction

of EUR 0.2 billion was recorded in Q4 2020 to meet
supervisory expectations on NPE. During the phase-in

from 2021 to 2024, we estimate that the combined annual
impact of NPE regulations will be of a similar order of
magnitude. The wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio
may result in a lower impact, while the effect of recalibrations
based on Covid-19 and recent impairments is still uncertain.
We are working on mitigating actions aimed at increasing
NPE velocity by intensifying management attention for
clients in FR&R and realising potential NPE divestments,
subject to market conditions.

CET1 capital decreased in 2020, mainly reflecting a capital
deduction of EUR 0.2 billion related to the regulatory
guidance on non-performing exposure (NPE) and, to a
lesser extent, FX movements and the yearto-date loss
over 2020. The final dividend for 2019 remains reserved
as dividend and has not been included in the CET1 capital.

The maximum distributable amount (MDA) trigger level has
been temporarily reduced to 9.6% (excluding AT1 shortfall)
owing to several capital relief measures announced by

he European Central Bank (ECB) and the Dutch Central
Bank (DNB) in March 2020 to support banks in serving the
economy and addressing operational challenges. The ECB
brought forward changes in CRDY, allowing banks to use
Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 to satisfy parts of the Pillar 2
requirements. DNB abolished the systemic risk buffer and
owered the other systemically important institutions (OSII)
buffer from 2% to 1.5%. In the future, DNB is expected

0 gradually increase the countercyclical capital buffer

rom 0% to 2% of Dutch risk-weighted exposures as

he economy improves. The reported CET1 ratio of 177%
under Basel Ill is considerably above the MDA trigger

evel of 9.6%. The bank remains committed to maintaining
a significant buffer in excess of its regulatory requirements
at all times.

In May 2020, ABN AMRO issued an AT1 instrument to
replace an outstanding AT instrument that was redeemed
in September 2020. A total of EUR 2.0 billion of AT1
instruments is currently outstanding. The AT1 instruments
have triggers at the bank consolidated level (20% CET1)
and solo level (5.125% CET1). If the CET1 ratio breaks
through the trigger level, the AT1 is temporarily written
down. ABN AMRO is comfortably above the trigger levels,
with the bank consolidated CET1 ratio at 177% and the
bank solo CET1 ratio at 173%. Available distributable items
at 31 December 2020 amounted to EUR 179 billion
(December 2019: EUR 18.5 billion).

The fully-loaded total capital ratio (23.7%) decreased by
2.2 percentage points compared to 31 December 2019
(25.9%). This was mainly due to the redemption of a

to a lesser extent, to the capital deduction of EUR 0.2 billion
related to the regulatory guidance on NPE.

Senior non-preferred capital

A total of EUR 2.5 billion of senior non-preferred instruments
is currently outstanding. The bank issued its first tranche of
EUR 1.25 billion in senior non-preferred notes in January 2020
and its second tranche of EUR 1.25 billion in May 2020.

Risk-weighted assets

Total RWA increased to EUR 110.5 billion (31 December 2019:
EUR 109.8 billion) due to an increase in credit risk RWA,
offset by a decrease in operational risk RWA. Market risk
RWA remained stable. The increase in credit risk was
predominantly driven by regulatory add-ons (including TRIM)
and the introduction of the new definition of default. This
movement was partly offset by business developments,
largely related to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio

of CIB. Operational risk decreased in line with the declining
trend of operational losses and the removal of regulatory
capital add-ons.

Further information on share capital, dividend

and capital instruments

Share capital

The share capital remained unchanged in 2020. At

31 December 2020, the authorised share capital amounted
to EUR 2,400 million, distributed as 2,200 million class A
ordinary shares and 200 million class B ordinary shares.
Class A and B ordinary shares have a nominal value of
EUR 1.00 each.

At 31 December 2020, issued and paid-up capital amounted
to EUR 940 million and consisted of 940 million class A
ordinary shares. Further information is provided in Note 32
Equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the
Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.

/ 136

Dividend

On 15 December 2020, the ECB revised its
recommendation on dividend payments and reiterated
that banks should exercise extreme prudence with regard
to capital distributions. To this end, the ECB recommends
that banks refrain from distributing any cash dividends or
conducting share buy-backs, or to limit such distributions,
until 30 September 2021. Given the persisting uncertainty
over the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,

he ECB expects dividends and share buy-backs to remain
below the lower of 15% of the cumulated profit for 2019-
2020 and 20 basis points of the CET1 ratio. Moreover, for
banks that have already distributed dividends or conducted
share buy-backs to remunerate shareholders with regard
0 the 2019 financial year, the profit definition includes only
he 2020 profit. Banks that intend to pay dividends or buy
back shares need to be profitable and have robust capital
rajectories. After 30 September 2021, and subject

o the absence of materially adverse developments,

he ECB intends to repeal the recommendation and return
‘© assessing banks’ capital and distribution plans based
on the outcome of the normal supervisory cycle.

Based on this revised ECB recommendation and the
year-to-date loss, no dividend will be proposed over 2020.
Furthermore, the profit for 2019 (including the full-year 2019
dividend reserve) is out of scope for payment at 04 2020
due to the interim dividend paid in 2019. The payment of
AT1 coupons is not affected by the ECB's recommendation
as the CET1 ratio is well above the MDA trigger level and
there are no constraints in availability of distributable items
(EUR 179 billion).

ABN AMRO is committed to resuming payment of
dividends sustainably, conditions permitting. For the time
being, we will follow the ECB recommendation and refrain
from distributing capital. The payout (or release) of accrued
full-year 2019 dividend will be prudently considered after
30 September 2021, taking account of the status of

the ECB dividend recommendation, as well as conditions
and prospects at that time. Until a decision has been
made, the final dividend for 2019 will not be included

in the CET1 capital.

Main regulatory developments

According to the Basel Committee, Basel IV needs to

be implemented by January 2023, with a 5-year phase-in
period of the output floor. An EU proposal for Basel IV

is expected in Q2 2021. Given recent TRIM and model
review developments, constrained IRB RWA and output
loored RWA are no longer expected to be materially
different in a Basel IV fully-loaded situation at bank level.

As a result, the benefit of the phase-in period will effectively
be eliminated. The gap between Basel II| and Basel IV is
expected to converge further in 2021 to below 10% by
year-end 2021. This is largely due to add-ons from a possible
DNB mortgage floor and the move of specific portfolios to
he Basel Ill foundation or standardised approach. We have
updated our CET1 target ratio to 13% under Basel IV.

Based on our interpretation of the Basel IV framework
and on our expectations of how Basel IV standards
will be implemented in EU legislation, the fully-loaded
Basel IV CET1 ratio was estimated to be above 15% on
31 December 2020, comfortably above target.

The CRR fully-loaded CET1 ratio at 31 December 2020
was 17.7%, which was equal to the CRR phase-in CET1
ratio. Under the CRD IV/CRR fully-loaded rules, the amount
of CET1 capital and RWA are equivalent to those under the
phase-in rules. The CRR fully-loaded total capital ratio at

31 December 2020 was 23.7%, which was slightly lower
than the CRR phase-in total capital ratio of 23.9%. In 2020,
the fully-loaded ratio was lower than the phase-in ratio due
to the grandfathering of some T2 capital instruments.

The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) includes

a non-risk-based leverage ratio. Based on the current
requirement (i.e. CEM methodology for derivative exposures),
the leverage ratio increased to 5.0% (31 December 2019:
4.5%), mainly reflecting the temporary exemption of central
bank reserves from the exposure measure, partly offset

by a decline in Tier 1 capital. This temporary exemption

had a positive impact of 0.6 percentage points as at

31 December 2020 and ends on 27 June 2021.

The current leverage ratio requirements will be amended
by CRR2, which introduces a binding leverage ratio

requirement of at least 3% and amends the requirements
for calculating the exposure measure. The amendment
includes the application of SA-CCR to clearing guarantees
on derivative exposures. ABN AMRO estimates that the
cumulative effect of the CRR2 adjustments, including
application of SA-CCR, will lower the exposure measure by
approximately EUR 56.9 billion and equals 0.6 percentage
points of the leverage ratio. As the temporary measure to
exempt central bank reserves ends on 27 June 2021 and
CRR2 applies from 28 June 2021 onwards, we currently
estimate these two effects will largely be offset, with

no material impact on the leverage ratio. The fully-loaded
ABN AMR®Mnnual Report 2020

leverage ratio based on SA-CCR decreased to 5.0% at
31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 5.2%), mainly
reflecting a decline in Tier 1 capital. The CRR2 leverage
ratio (including SA-CCR) would be 5.8% if central bank
reserves were to continue being exempted from the
exposure measure.

Going forward, ABN AMRO will monitor and report the
leverage ratio based on currently applicable rules and CRR2,
and we expect the leverage ratio to remain above the
anticipated regulatory requirements.

buffer requirement of 4%. This will apply with effect

from 1 January 2022, one year earlier than expected, as

of 27% by 2022. Based on own funds, subordinated
instruments and SNP notes, MREL was 27.4% as at

31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 28.5%).
Compared to 31 December 2019, MREL decreased

mainly due to a capital deduction of EUR 0.2 billion related
to the regulatory guidance on NPE, the redemption of

a EUR 1.5 billion Tier 2 instrument on 30 June 2020,

and a EUR 1.2 billion grandfathered Tier 2 instrument that
was no longer eligible for MREL as of April 2020 because
of maturing within a year. This was partly offset by the
issuance of the senior non-preferred notes in 2020. While
we are compliant with the preliminary intermediate MREL
target, we will review our targets after receiving the final
MREL letter to ensure we continue to operate in line with
our requirements. The final MREL letter is expected in the
coming months. Issuances will reflect the new targets.

Sustainability risk

The sustainability risk review provides an in-depth overview
of three important components of sustainability risk
management. Firstly, we provide more details on due
diligence for individual clients considered high risk from

a sustainability perspective and on the role of the second
line of defence in this respect. Secondly, more information
is provided on various analyses that were performed to
assess the climate risk of portfolios in sectors that are
considered highly sensitive to climate risk. Thirdly, we
provide insight into how greenhouse gas emissions are
measured and steered. The latter two are in line with the
recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures.

Advice on increased sustainability risk

Certain industries face more sustainability risks than others,
while the nature of these risks also varies considerably.
Sustainability risk analysts in the credit risk department
provide advice on clients operating in industries with a
higher sustainability risk profile. These analysts are the
second line of defence for environmental, social and ethical
risks. Sustainability risk assessments are done as part

of two processes: KYC (assessing the client relationship

as a whole) and, in the event of a lending relationship,
credit risk assessments.

Sustainability risk management for corporate clients is
integrated in the due diligence and risk processes of

the bank. The first line of defence is responsible for
managing these risks. In cases where the client's activities
or performance lead to a high sustainability risk profile,

the second line provides expert advice to the relevant
decision-making authority. In most cases, this advice is fully
integrated in the client or credit decisions. If a client does
not fully meet our Sustainability Risk Policy framework, the
second line will either advise negatively on the relationship/
credit or accept it subject to conditions. In most cases,
conditions are set. This is in line with the bank's inclusive
strategy. Conditions are set in order to become or remain
comfortable that the client is moving towards full compliance
and usually consist of monitoring, client engagement or

a combination of the two. The processes are described

in more detail below.

Know Your Client (KYC)

For all corporate clients, sustainability risk due diligence
takes place at the moment of onboarding (Client Acceptance)
and subsequently in periodic reviews. Sometimes, event-
driven reviews are performed. In the KYC process, the
Detecting Financial Crime (DFC) analysts screen for
sustainability risk triggers. In the event of a potentially high
sustainability risk, DFC sends the file to the second line.

/ 141

This happened 433 times in 2020. Out of these, there
were 102 cases where a high sustainability risk was found
and where formal advice was issued by the second line.

Sustainability risk assessments related to lending

In lending relationships, a more extensive sustainability
assessment takes place. In the case of these relationships,
assessments take place at the moment of loan origination
and are repeated in periodic (usually annual) monitoring.
ABN AMRO applies specific policy requirements for its
lending clients in nine high-risk sectors. Each sector is
divided into multiple subsectors and activities at different
places in the supply chain and matched with specific
requirements. The first line of defence assesses the

level of clients’ compliance with these policies, and the
second line validates these assessments. In the event

of insufficient comfort, for example due to a major policy
gap or incident, a high-intensity engagement trajectory
can be started for a maximum of three years or the second
line will issue negative advice. In 2020, advice on a lending
relationship was given on 274 occasions.

Sustainability risk advice in 2020

In 2020, 376 cases were identified with a high sustainability
risk profile and where expert advice was consequently
required from the second line. In 12 of these cases, the
advice given by the second line was negative, while 178
cases were approved and 186 cases were approved subject
to conditions.

Climate Risk Management

ABN AMRO is strongly committed to implementing the
recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Taskforce
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2019, we
took our first steps in using scenario analysis to measure and
disclose the climate risk in our residential mortgages and
upstream oil and gas portfolios. In 2020 we continued working
to improve these analyses and extended the use of climate

scenario analysis to assess the climate risk of portfolios
in the commercial real estate and shipping sectors.

Climate Risk Heatmap

The above sectors were identified as priority sectors
following a heatmap exercise based on the methodology
provided by the UN Environment Programme Finance
Initiative (UNEP Fl). The heatmap shows material sectors in
terms of sensitivity to transition or physical climate risks
and corporate lending exposure. The sectors in the heatmap
are subsectors of the Industry Classification Benchmark
(ICB) segments, as presented in the Credit risk section. This
higher level of granularity allowed us to consider varieties of
climate risk sensitivity within sectors. The strategy review

/ 142

was announced in 2020 and exposure in some sectors
started to decrease. Although the actual and foreseen
decreases in these sectors have not yet impacted the
list of priority sectors, they have been taken into account
in the further scenario analyses. It was decided to
repeat the heatmap exercise on a regular basis to reflect
changes in exposure, and also new insights into climate
risk vulnerabilities.

This figure shows the heatmap of climate risk sensitivity,
based on the lending exposure in the sector and the
sector's inherent sensitivity to climate risk.

Where the heatmap focuses on the inherent vulnerability
of a sector to climate risk, the scenario analyses then focus
on measuring the actual climate risk of our portfolios in
these sectors. The overview presented below shows the
methodologies used and the insights obtained from these
scenario analyses so far.

Residential and Commercial Real Estate

In 2019, we analysed the physical risk associated with
flooding (causing direct damage) and drought (causing
damage through decreasing ground water levels and
foundation pole rot) of our Dutch mortgage portfolio.

In 2020, we improved the portfolio analysis by including
more granular pole rot data provided by Kennis Centrum
Aanpak Funderingsproblematiek (KCAF). We also performed
a similar analysis on commercial real estate to examine
the effects of flooding and drought on the collateral value
of our commercial real estate portfolio.

In 2019, the analysis showed that relatively few properties
had a significant risk of flooding (probabilities ranging from
1/300-1/30). The analysis in 2020 showed that the climate
risk in our mortgage portfolio at yearend 2020 was not
significantly higher or lower than at yearend 2019. The
picture showed by commercial real estate (CRE) assets
was similar to that of residential mortgages in terms of
probabilities. From a damage perspectve, however, the
variance was found to be much greater. Among other
things, this is because of the greater variety in asset types
in commercial real estate and the corresponding calculation
of damage. For residential mortgages, we used the damage
calculation provided by Deltares (‘Standaard Schade en
Slachtoffer Module 2017’) for residential buildings, whereas
for commercial real estate we used Deltares’ damage
calculations for other asset types such as retail properties,
industrial real estate and healthcare premises.

Besides assessing the direct impact of flooding on our
portfolio in 2020, we also assessed the indirect impact of
flooding on the macroeconomy and the resulting impact

on the residential mortgage and CRE portfolios. The applied
scenarios contained flooding events of different magnitudes
(0.5 and 2 metres) affecting the macroeconomy, and
specifically including the Dutch house price index. The
outcome showed a substantial increase in credit risk,

with increasingly adverse implications of the scenarios.
We plan to perform more stress testing on other portfolios
and climate risks in 2021. The objective is to develop a
methodology that can ultimately be included in the regular
stress testing cycle.

Drought, subsidence and pole rot

For the mortgage portfolio we used the new 2020 data
from KCAF. These new data are significantly more granular
and show greater variety in terms of the probability of
foundation issues and subsidence for the properties in
our portfolio. As the availability and quality of data are
continually improving, we have to regularly update

our analyses.

Compared to the analysis in 2019, the number of

properties with a high or very high probability of pole rot
and subsidence has increased. The effect of this at a bank
level has required additional research. Based on property
and client characteristics we are now working to identify
the clients that are most vulnerable to this risk and have
started strategic discussions internally to develop mitigation
measures and create a positive impact for these vulnerable
client groups in particular.

/ 143

The new KCAF data will be available for our CRE portfolio
from 2021 onwards. In 2020 we therefore used the older,
less granular data to create an initial overview of the risks.
As our commercial real estate portfolio is smaller and much
more concentrated in the Randstad area, the picture it
portrays is somewhat different from that of the mortgage
portfolio. A relatively high percentage (approximately 21%)
of the CRE collateral has a high probability (up to 30%) of
pole rot and subsidence. Once the new KCAF data can also
be used for CRE, and if strategic mitigating actions are
needed, we will be able to determine the overall impact on
the bank.

This map shows all the properties in our mortgage portfolio
in the Netherlands and their risk of pole rot and subsidence

The effect of lost revenues has not been included in the
CRE analysis. This is an important factor as the assets in
the CRE portfolio are a source of income for the owners
and tenants. This aspect will also be included in the analysis
in 2021. In addition, and contrary to the mortgage portfolio,
multiple clients in the CRE portfolio own multiple assets.
We also plan, therefore, to include the concentration risk

in our portfolio and also in clients’ portfolios in the analysis
in 2021.

To examine the financial impact for the bank — and in line
with regulatory expectations — a preliminary assessment of
how the potential damage impacts our risk-weighted assets
is being performed. These insights will be considered when
climate risk is further integrated into our risk management
policies and practices.

Shipping
Given the large volumes of goods that can be transported
by one vessel, shipping can be considered relatively

cost- and GHG-efficient compared to other modes of
ransportation such as road or air. Nevertheless the sector
is responsible for approximately 2.5% of global GHG
emissions. Given the expected growth in international
rade, and hence in the demand for transport, this could
increase to 10% in 2050, according to the International
aritime Organization (IMO). This would undermine the

/ 144

Paris Agreement. The IMO has therefore set targets to
reduce GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared
to 2008 (“the IMO Absolute Target”) and CO, emissions
per transport work by at least 40% by 2030, with efforts
to achieve a 70% reduction by 2050 compared to 2008
(“the IMO Intensity Targets”).

Our analysis in 2020 focused on seagoing vessels and

their alignment with the IMO targets. We assumed that

the value of the collateral securing our shipping exposure
may be reduced by the need for fleets to be more fuel-
efficient and less carbon-dependent in order to achieve
these targets. Two measures were used to assess alignment:
the Rightship rating and the Poseidon Principles.

Rightship rating

Based on ship design and engine performance the Rightship
rating measures a ship's theoretical CO, emissions
performance. It is presented using the standard European
energy efficiency scale: the relative performance of a vessel
is given a rating of A to G, with the most efficient being A
and the least efficient being G. The ratings is relative to
other vessels. Almost all the vessels we finance have a
Rightship rating. The table below shows the exposure per
risk label, based on the June 2020 fleet data. We assume
that the most efficient vessels are best-positioned to align
with the IMO target.

This table shows the normal (global) label distribution, as
well as the label distribution within the ABN AMRO portfolio.

Normal distribution ABN AMRO

| A | 2.5% 6.0%
|B | 13.5% 26.0%
ic | 16.0% 12.0%
D 36.0% 36.0%
| E | 16.0% 13.0%
| F | 13.5% 7.0%
|G | 2.50% 0.0%

Poseidon Principles

The Poseidon Principles measure alignment by comparing
carbon intensity relative to the IMO decarbonisation
rajectories. In contrast to the Rightship ratings, the
Poseidon reporting is based on real fuel consumption data.
ABN AMRO, one of the founding signatories of the
Poseidon Principles, is currently slightly behind on the IMO
argets (5% at a portfolio level). A deep dive into the
portfolio showed a wide variety among types of vessels
and loan portfolios. Engagement has therefore started with
hose clients whose performance is in need of greatest
improvement. A further analysis in 2021 will look into the
optimal portfolio composition, taking into account scenarios

assuming different levels of carbon taxes and other
regulatory measures in the future.

Energy

In 2019, we performed a qualitative analysis of the transition
risk in our upstream oil and gas portfolio. We complemented
this in 2020 with a quantitative analysis. In accordance with
the UNEP FI recommendations, we applied the Sustainable
Development Scenario (SDS) of the International Energy
Agency (IEA) and various REMIND scenarios of the Potsdam
Institute for Climate Impact Research to our upstream oil
and gas portfolio, using a variety of methodologies.

We first used a Transition Risk Tool developed by UNEP FI
to assess how the portfolio is developing in terms of the
probability of default and expected loss. The scenarios
showed the greatest variance in the medium term (5-10
years), but all 2°C scenarios showed limited but increasing
expected losses in the long term (30 years). As the tenors
in our upstream oil and gas portfolio are relatively short,
we assume there is time to adapt.

It is assumed that the adaptation pathway will include an
increasing portfolio of renewables. We therefore assessed
the required development in the portfolio composition to
align with the SDS scenario. In 2021, we will strengthen
the analysis by using the Paris Agreement Capital Transition
Assessment (PACTA) tool developed for banks by the 2°
Investing Initiative. An initial exercise using this tool was

CO, emissions summary table — totals

(in ktons)

/ 145

performed in early 2020 to assess the bank's energy
portfolios.

Lastly, we performed a break-even price analysis, using
Rystad data. The purpose of this analysis was to test the
resilience of the ABN AMRO portfolio against oil, gas and
CO, prices in the above scenarios. This analysis showed our
clients’ positions compared to those of the rest of the world
in terms of break-even prices and CO, intensities in 2020.
We will complement this analysis in 2021, taking account of
developments in break-even prices.

GHG measuring and steering

Further steps were taken in respect of measuring and
steering GHG emissions. Based on the Partnership for
Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology, we
measure and report the scope 3 GHG emissions in our
lending and investment portfolios. We have also committed
to the Science-Based Target Initiative to start steering on
carbon reduction in various key portfolios: energy, mortgages,
commercial real estate, and investments. In 2020, we
analysed the Paris alignment of these portfolios. We plan
to publish the results in Q2 2021.

The table below reflects the scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG
emissions from our operations and lending portfolio,
expressed in ktons of CO, equivalent. The definitions of
these scopes are based on the GHG protocol of the World
Resources Institute (WRI).

sources of information, including company-level emissions
data (for stock exchange-listed corporate clients) and
average carbon intensities by energy label (for residential
mortgages and corporate real estate finance) and by sector

g solar energy) and heating & cooling, location based figures provided by energy suppliers (the Netherlands and rest of world).

(for other corporates). We updated our methodology and
data sources in 2020. Among other changes, we started

to use the PCAF emission factor database as a data source
for corporates outside the Netherlands. Comparative figures
on CO, have been adjusted accordingly. More detailed
emission reporting can be found in our Non-Financial Data

Management Control Statement

By virtue of Principle 1.4 (Risk management accountability)
of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, ABN AMRO’s
Executive Board is required to account for the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the bank's internal risk
management and control systems. By virtue of Principle 2.5
(Culture) of the Code, the Executive Board is responsible
for promoting a culture aimed at creating long-term value
for the company and its affiliated enterprises. By virtue

of Principle 2.5.4 (Accountability regarding culture), the
Executive Board is required to explain the bank's values

and how these values are incorporated into the activities

of the company and its affiliated enterprises, and to account
for the effectiveness of and the bank's compliance with

the Code of Conduct.

ABN AMRO's internal risk management and control process
is effectuated by the Executive Board, management and
other staff. It is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the achievement of objectives in the following
categories:

H effectiveness and efficiency of operations;

H reliability of financial and non-financial information;

H compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies;
H safeguarding of assets, identification and management

of liabilities; and
s

H strategic and business objectives.

ABN AMRO's first and second lines of defence perform
their roles in risk assessments, stress tests, evaluations

of the operating effectiveness of controls, and reporting

on risk management and control systems. The concluding
results are reported in formal risk reports and discussed

at senior management level. Group Audit, as the third line
of defence, evaluates the design and effectiveness of

ABN AMRO's governance, as well as its risk management
and control systems. Audit reports are discussed with
relevant Executive Committee members. Group Audit
attended the Executive Board and/or Executive Committee
meetings every quarter to discuss the Quarterly Audit
Opinions. In 2020, the evaluation of the adequacy of

ABN AMRO's internal risk management and control systems
was regularly discussed with the Audit Committee, the Risk
& Capital Committee and the full Supervisory Board.

In compliance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of

the Corporate Governance Code (Statement by the
management board) and based on ABN AMRO's risk
management processes, the Executive Board makes the
following statements and provides clear substantiation
regarding the internal risk management and control systems,
taking into account ABN AMRO's strategy of pursuing

a moderate risk profile:

H The Executive Board’s report in ABN AMRO’s 2020
Annual Report provides sufficient insights into any failings
in the effectiveness of the internal risk management
and control systems (best practice 1.4.3.i);

H The internal risk management and control systems
provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting
for 2020 does not contain any material inaccuracies
(best practice 1.4.3.ii);

H Based on the current state of affairs, preparation of the
financial reporting for 2020 on a going-concern basis is
justified (best practice 1.4.3. iii). For further information,
please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies in the
Consolidated Annual Financial Statements;

H The Executive Board’s report states those material risks
and uncertainties that are relevant to expectations
regarding ABN AMRO's continuity for the period of

welve months following the preparation of this report

best practice 1.4.3.iv);

H The Executive Board’s report explains the bank's values

and how they are incorporated into the activities of

he company and its affiliated enterprises, and accounts

or the effectiveness of and the bank's compliance with

he Code of Conduct (best practice 2.5.4). For further
information, please refer to Risk culture in the Risk,
unding & capital management section.

Regarding internal risk management and control systems,
the Executive Board has identified the following external
factors as potentially having an impact on ABN AMRO's
current business model:
H As the Covid-19 health crisis continues to affect us all,
the well-being of the bank’s clients and staff remains its
main focus. The bank's strong digital backbone combined
with the dedication and flexibility of its staff ensured the
services to clients remained consistent and the operating
result resilient. The bank strengthened its risk management
activities and reporting during the crisis, also in response
to the increase in regulatory requirements. Covid-19 has
had a significant impact on our financial performance
and has resulted in high impairments. The main business
continuity measures taken are detailed in Operational
(non-financial) risk in the Risk, funding & capital review
section of this report. In December 2020, the Netherlands
entered into another partial lockdown. The bank is therefore
cautious about the outlook and concerned about the
long-term impact on society, but also more positive
as vaccines are being made available and rolled out;

H Adverse macroeconomic and monetary conditions
(such as a downturn in the economy, and persistently
low or negative interest rates), reformed fiscal policies,
geopolitical uncertainty (Such as the impact of the Brexit
deal, trade tensions and sanctions) and competition

(for instance, pressure on the bank's market share
in mortgages) that could limit execution of the bank’s
planned growth strategies;

H Laws and regulations that could have an impact on
the bank's strategic position, revenues, costs and
capital adequacy (examples include additional capital
requirements for the Dutch mortgage market,

GDPR and sustainable finance regulations);

H Developments in the field of sustainability that could
impair asset values and thus the creditworthiness
of clients.

These external factors may impact specific businesses,
thus hindering ABN AMRO in the achievement of its
strategic goals. As part of its recent strategy review, the
Executive Board has defined client segments and value
propositions that will be developed to compensate for
hese external developments (such as a more fee-based
business model and rigorously simplifying and centralising
he operating model, enabling the bank to focus on clients
and work more efficiently).

ot being compliant with laws and regulations may lead
0 reputational damage, fines and changes in ABN AMRO's
income and costs or capital basis and could endanger

ong-term goals. Ensuring demonstrable compliance requires
robust risk governance, enhanced data management
and a substantial share of the bank's resources.

Specific areas where the risk of non-compliance with
regulations and heightened regulatory scrutiny require
substantial effort by the bank are:

H Anti-Mone y Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism
Financing (CTF), including Customer Due Diligence/

Know Your Client . ABN AMRO is fully cooperating in
an investigation by the Dutch Public Prosecutor relating
to requirements under the Act on the prevention of
money laundering and financing of terrorism (Wwift).
More information on this is provided in the Regulatory
environment section, the Non-financial review section
and Note 34 Commitments and contingent liabilities

in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements;

H Duty of car e towards the banks clients . Good progress
was made in the bank-wide Duty of Care framework,
reflecting regulatory requirements, regulatory expectations
and the bank's duty of care ambition. More information
on this is provided in the Crime & integrity disclosure in
the Non-financial review in the Strategy & performance
section of this report. In addition, the bank is seeing an
increased claim risk in respect of variable interest rates
for several products, e.g. revolving consumer loans;

H Credit Risk Management _. Collateral management,
credit risk modelling and credit risk monitoring and
reporting require remediation. More information on
this is provided in the Credit risk management section.

/ 147

Remediation programmes, related to Anti-money laundering
(AML) and CounterTerrorism Financing (CTF), Duty of care
and Credit Risk Management aimed at improving

ABN AMRO's performance in these areas, were initiated
and were well underway in 2020 in order to remedy
shortcomings and ensure full compliance with legislation
bank-wide. In 2019, the bank established a centralised
Detecting Financial Crime department, started programmes
to address potential issues involving products sold in the
past (such as consumer credit and mortgages) and further
improved the monitoring of regulatory changes and
overseeing their implementation. From 2021, the
remediation will require a substantial, multi-year effort,
especially with regard to the regulatory areas mentioned
above. In addition to its remediation programmes, the bank
is investing to improve regular processes aimed at ensuring
stays compliant going forward.

In the past, ABN AMRO's legal predecessor, Fortis Bank
(Nederland) N.V., ABN AMRO and several (former)
subsidiaries were directly or indirectly involved in
transactions relating to equity trading extending over
dividend record dates, including several forms of tainted
dividend arbitrage, i.e. dividend stripping.

It cannot be excluded that ABN AMRO or subsidiaries will
face financial consequences as a result of their involvement
in these transactions, including penalties and other measures
under criminal law and civil law claims. The bank has been
implementing measures to prevent it from being involved

in tainted dividend arbitrage in the future.

More information on this risk is provided under Note 34
Commitments and contingent liabilities in the Consolidated

Annual Financial Statements.

The Executive Board has identified and agreed on the
following six areas for improvement, which are being
actively managed by senior management:

H ITenvironment: The bank is enhancing its IT landscape
via digitalisation and innovation. Substantial efforts are
required to improve the IT infrastructure, identity and
access management and IT controls to strengthen
its cyber posture. These IT issues, combined with a
complex IT infrastructure and multiple third parties,
may result in ineffective business process execution
and missed opportunities in the application of new
technologies. The bank is subject to increasing risks
from cyber attacks potentially jeopardising confidential
data or business processes.

H Data management: _ The financial services industry and
its supervision are becoming increasingly data-driven,
and data privacy is a key aspect of data management.
The bank needs to make substantial efforts in order
to improve the control of its data quality and availability
so as to meet requirements regarding data aggregation,

data use and risk reporting (e.g. Principles for Effective
Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting). These
aspects of data management, combined with issues
concerning the quality of (historical) data, data ownership,
data knowledge and a complex IT infrastructure, may
result in suboptimal decision-making and business
process execution, as well as in elevated model risk.
Data management and preventing data leakage also play
an important role in addressing privacy risk. An improved
data policy was delivered in 2020, and progress was
made in many areas, e.g. strengthening the banks’ data
quality controls and the data quality issue remediation
process. However, data management requires a multi-year
approach in order for the bank to reach the desired level.
Chang e accumulation: The complexity, accumulation
and interdependencies of the bank's transformation
programmes, including all prioritised regulatory changes/
issues and the wind-down of the non-core activities of
CIB (exiting all non-European corporate banking activities,
except for Clearing), are leading to an accumulation of
change risk. This may cause delays, potentially resulting
in increased operational costs and time-to-market issues,
and the bank possibly lagging behind new entrants.
Alignment of these changes has been realised via a
revised strategy plan and an improved transition plan

and governance to further improve execution discipline.
The CIB non-core wind-down to pursue our moderate
risk profile is well underway.
Extemal fraud: The continued increase in advanced
external crime threats may expose the bank and its
clients to cyber fraud attacks, disruptions of in-house and
outsourced IT, ATM and sealbag attacks and loan fraud.
ABN AMRO is working with crime-fighting authorities
and other relevant authorities, as well as with other
banks, to tackle these issues. We note that regulatory
initiatives are increasingly aimed at protecting clients
from payment fraud, even if banks are not liable.

For example, the Dutch Parliament recently approved

a motion that expects clients to be compensated by
banks if they become victims of spoofing by criminals.
We expect more duty of care developments and/or

/ 148

regulations regarding fraud going forward.

H People and culture: The difficulties of attracting,
developing and retaining qualified staff in certain areas
remain a point of attention, especially in the context of
the lockdown impacting the well-being of staff. This risk
is mitigated by various programmes focused on strategic
workforce management, culture and leadership in
transformation. A further reduction of around 15% of
staff is expected by 2024, mostly from 2022 onwards.
The impact on staff will be reduced through natural
attrition and by reskilling to roles where we expect
shortages. These improvements, alongside the
implementation of a significant culture change, with
focus on performance management and strategy
execution and ownership, will help the bank achieve
its strategic goals.

H Risk Contr ol Framework: The effectiveness of the Risk
Control Framework is under continuous improvement
to assure management is in control. Management is
improving the Risk Control Framework via several
additional control-related assessments.

In the meantime, measures have been taken to minimise and
mitigate the risks with regard to all areas of improvement.

It should be noted that ABN AMRO's internal risk
management and control systems do not provide complete
assurance on the realisation of business objectives,

nor do they prevent or detect inaccuracies, fraud and
non-compliance with rules and regulations at all times.

Maturity based on contractual undiscounted

cash flows b

The following tables provide a maturity analysis of the
earliest contractual undiscounted cash flows for financial
assets and liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities held
for trading are recorded in On demand, at fair value.

We believe this best represents the short-term nature

and cash flows of these activities. The contractual maturity
of the instruments may be extended over significantly
longer periods.

a combination of internal and external risk drivers.
The models are used for monitoring the bank's liquidity
mismatch position.

non-maturing assets (mainly current accounts), credit cards,

non-maturing liabilities (demand deposits and current
accounts) and term deposits. The liquidity risk models
predict the behavioural cash flows, which can differ from
the contractual cash flows as a result of, for example,
prepayments or because some products do not have a
defined contractual maturity date. The models are based
on historically observed client behaviour and use

The liquidity risk models are included in the bank's model
risk management framework. This means that the models
have to follow a regular monitoring and validation schedule.
Approval of the models is given by the Methodology
Acceptance Group (MAG) ALM/T, based on independent
advice from Model Validation.
