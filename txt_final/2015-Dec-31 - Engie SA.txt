1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

1.1.1. General presentation

The ENGIE Group is one of the world's leading industrial companies and
a benchmark in the fields of gas, electricity and energy services.

It is active throughout the entire energy value chain, in electricity and
natural gas, upstream to downstream in:

= purchasing, production and marketing of natural gas and electricity;

= transmission, storage, distribution, management and development of
major natural gas infrastructures;

= energy services.

This model was heavily impacted in 2015 by the energy revolution which
was marked by the sustained collapse of prices for natural gas, oil and
electricity in numerous markets worldwide, in a context of production
overcapacity.

Against this backdrop, the Group was nevertheless able to rely on its
strong positions in regulated infrastructure, business services, and the
fast-growing renewable generation segment. The development of these
same activities, accompanied by a bold asset rotation plan, will enable
the Group to transform itself into a leader of the energy revolution over
the next three years.

Listed in Paris and Brussels, ENGIE is represented in the major stock
indices (see Section 5.1.1.1 “Share capital and voting rights”).

The Group's fundamental values are drive, commitment, daring and
cohesion.

On February 25, 2016, the Group presented its new strategic vision
following the meeting of the Board of Directors held the day before.

1.1.2 History and evolution of the Company

The Company is the result of the merger-absorption of SUEZ by Gaz de
France, following the decisions of the Combined Shareholders’ Meetings
of Gaz de France and SUEZ of July 16, 2008. The merger took effect on
July 22, 2008.

Initially incorporated in 1946 as an EPIC (French public industrial and
commercial enterprise), it became a limited liability company with a
99-year term under Law 2004-803 of August 9, 2004 on the electricity
and gas public service and electricity and gas companies (amending
Law 46-628 of April 8, 1946) whose provisions were aimed at organizing
the change in the Company's legal status.

On July 7, 2005, the Company publicly floated its shares on the stock
market. The Company's shares, under its former name, Gaz de France,
were first listed on July 7, 2005.

Law 2004-803 of August 9, 2004, as amended by Law 2006-1537 of
December 7, 2006 governing the energy sector and Decree 2007-1784
of December 19, 2007, authorized the transfer of the Company from the
public to the private sector. On July 22, 2008, the Company absorbed
SUEZ in a merger which entailed transferring the majority of the
Company's share capital to the private sector. The new company took
the name “GDF SUEZ”.

SUEZ itself was the result of the merger in 1997 of Compagnie de Suez
and Lyonnaise des Eaux. At the time, Compagnie de Suez — which had
built and operated the Suez Canal until its nationalization by the
Egyptian government in 1956 - was a holding company with diversified
stakes in Belgium and France, particularly in the finance and energy
sectors. Lyonnaise des Eaux was a diversified company active in the
management and treatment of water, waste, construction,
communication and technical facility management. SUEZ became an
international industrial and services group whose objective was to meet
essential requirements in electricity, gas, energy and industry services,
water and waste management.

The deregulation of European energy markets in the early 1990s
promoted the international development of both Gaz de France and
SUEZ, which progressively expanded their activities beyond their
respective traditional markets, both in Europe and internationally.

On February 3, 2011, the Company completed a merger with
International Power. In 2012, it confirmed its strategy as a global energy
player, finalizing the purchase of shares held by the minority
shareholders of International Power on June 29, 2012.

The shareholders’ agreement for SUEZ Environnement Company
expired on July 22, 2013 and was not renewed. The cooperation and
shared functions agreement and the financing agreement between the
Company and SUEZ Environnement Company have also come to an
end. The Company now uses the equity method to consolidate SUEZ
Environnement Company's activities in its financial statements, rather
than full consolidation.

The Company intends to maintain its role as a long-term strategic
partner of SUEZ Environnement Company and as its majority
shareholder. The guiding principles of the industrial and commercial
agreements between the Company and SUEZ Environnement Company
were confirmed in January 2013, and form the basis of a framework
agreement between the two companies, similar to what might have
been concluded with third parties outside the Group. They relate to
reciprocal preference, under market conditions, in purchasing/sales,
continuing cooperation in certain industrial activities, development of
potential joint commercial offerings and cooperation in sustainable
development, innovation and research and development.

As well as this framework agreement, SUEZ Environnement Company
and the Company signed external purchasing agreements that allowed
SUEZ Environnement Company to benefit from the Company's
purchasing conditions until July 2015.

Lastly, in early March 2016, the two companies signed an agreement
providing for the contribution of all of SUEZ IP's share capital from
ENGIE to SUEZ Environnement Company, which owns all intellectual
property rights related to the SUEZ brand. The main terms and
conditions of this transaction as set out in the contribution agreement
are detailed in section 4.5.1.

On July 29, 2015, the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting, chaired by
Gérard Mestrallet, approved a change in the company name, and
adopted “ENGIE” as its new legal name.

The name of the share listed on the stock market was also changed to
ENGIE, and its code changed to “ENGI”, with effect from July 31, 2015.

ENGIE has its head office at 1, place Samuel de Champlain, 92400
Courbevoie, France. The telephone number is +33 (0) 1 44 22 00 00.
ENGIE is listed in the Nanterre Trade and Companies Register under
reference number 542,107,651. Its NAF (French business sectors) code
is 35232.

Presentation of the Group
1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

ENGIE is a public limited liability company (société anonyme) with a
Board of Directors subject to the laws and regulations governing public
limited companies and any specific laws governing the Company, and to.
its bylaws.

The Company's 12-month fiscal year runs from January1 to
December 31 of each year.

1.1.3. Organization

Until December 31, 2015, ENGIE was organized at operational level into
five business lines (for details, see Section 1.3, “Description of business.
lines in 2015").

At the end of 2014, Gérard Mestrallet asked Isabelle Kocher, Deputy
Chief Executive Officer, to develop an organizational structure that could
speed up the Group's transformation. The assignment included setting
medium- and long-term goals for each business, in line with the strategy
discussed by the Board of Directors during the 2014 strategy meeting.
The four key aims were to 1) simplify the Group's organizational
structure; 2) bring ENGIE closer to its customers and regions; 3) make it
a key player in the energy transition by shrinking the gap between
technology and consumers; and 4) improve collaboration between the
Group’s companies.

On April 1, 2015, Gérard Mestrallet and Isabelle Kocher presented a
new “enterprise project” to the European Works Committee. The project
was also presented to employee representative bodies in a consultation
process that began in April 2015 and ended on November 13, 2015.
The Company approved the organizational structure on November 23,
2015 and assigned some 350 employees to new positions of
responsibility.

ENGIE’s new organizational structure took effect on January 1, 2016.
The aim is to lower the Group's center of gravity and manage its results
and performance through 24 newly-created business entities (BU). Each
BU is responsible for its own P&L. This structure is tailored to the
challenges of an increasingly decentralized energy world. The BUs have
therefore been set up geographically - by country or group of countries
- according to the concentration of business activities in the region
concerned. These BUs cover all Group activities and address the
challenges faced by customers and counterparties in a given region.

= Ten geographical BUs have been set up as follows: Africa; North
America; Latin America; Asia-Pacific; Benelux; Brazil; China; Northern,
Southern and Eastern Europe; Middle East, South & Central Asia and
Turkey; and the United Kingdom. The BUs are responsible for
centrally managing all Group activities within their region.

= France has a special structure, given its size and the presence of
regulated entities. It has eight entities, four specializing in gas
infrastructure (transmission, distribution, terminals and storage) and
four related to the B2B, B2C, networks, and renewables businesses.

@ In addition, there is a Generation Europe BU focusing on thermal
power generation.

= Finally, there are five global BUs with overall responsibility for their
respective activities worldwide. These complement the operational
BUs and are as follows: International Exploration & Production; Global
Energy Management; Global LNG; Tractebel Engineering; and
Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT).

In addition to this geographical structure, five Métiers (business lines)
have been created: gas value chain; centralized power generation;
decentralized solutions for cities and regions; business solutions; and
solutions for residential customers and contractors, a Métier that
includes Solairedirect. The role of these Métiers is to:

= accelerate growth by supporting projects and managing major
programs for the future (energy efficiency, energy renovation of
buildings, green mobility, truck-delivered LNG, biogas, etc.);

= participate in key decisions (investment, disinvestment, etc.) in
conjunction with regional heads;

= operate as a network, in part to identify and prepare the skilled talent
needed to develop the BUs.

Six operational functions and five functional divisions supplement the
organizational structure, each ome headed by an_ executive
vice-president. Their purpose is to support the BUs and strengthen the
initiatives of the Métiers by developing synergies in the Group.

The operational functions are as follows: Strategic Sourcing &
Procurement, Business Development Oversight (BDO), Research &
Technologies, Nuclear Development, Industrial Projects, and Group
Knowledge Management.

The functional divisions are as follows: the Finance Division; the General
Secretariat; the Communications, Marketing and Environmental and
Societal Responsibility Division; the Group Human Resources Division;
and the Strategy Division.

Finally, there are four divisions that report directly to the Chief Executive
Officer: the Group Audit, Risk and Internal Control Division; the
European and International Relations Division; the Sales, Innovation and
New Businesses Division; and the Nuclear Safety and Radiation
Protection Division, which includes the Digital project.

The Company operates its own business; it has the organization of an
integrated industrial group. At the end of 2015, the number of the
Company's direct or indirect subsidiaries (controlling interest) was
approximately 2,000. The Group's main consolidated subsidiaries are
listed in Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements - Note 2 (Main
subsidiaries at December 31, 2015)”. For a list of major subsidiaries and
investments directly owned by the Company, see Section 6.4 “Parent
company financial statements - Note 23 (Subsidiaries and
investments)".

The Company's activities and the strategic economic assets of its main
subsidiaries as well as their geographical location are presented in
Section 1.3 “Description of business lines in 2015", which reflects the
Group's organization at the end of 2015.

Presentation of the Group

1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

1.1.4 Strategic Priorities

The markets in which the Group is expanding are currently undergoing
profound change:

increase in energy demand is concentrated in the fast growing
economies: 100% of the increase in primary energy consumption
between 2013 and 2040 will take place outside the OECD countries,
according to the International Energy” (IEA);

= natural gas is playing a more central role at the global level due to
abundant resources brought on by the development of
unconventional gas production (nearly 220 years of probable
reserves"), growth in demand (+1.4% annually between 2012 and
2040") and an expanding outlook for new uses (retail LNG, etc.);

in Europe (EU 28) the energy transition has begun in many countries:
the contribution of renewable sources of energy (excluding
hydropower) to the energy mix will increase from 16% to 38%
between 2013 and 2040", and energy efficiency issues are
developing;

= energy will be increasingly managed at local level, and even
individually. “Consumer-players” are taking control of their
consumption and sometimes even generating power.

The economic slowdown in Europe and energy efficiency policies have
led to a fall in consumption which, in combination with continuing
development of renewable energy and plentiful cheap coal, has
generated surplus capacity and low electricity prices in the long term.
This situation has caused a significant crisis in thermal power
generation.

The transition - indeed the energy revolution - has been ongoing for
several years at three different levels:

@ the technological revolution is gaining pace thanks to progress in
photovoltaics, batteries and micro heat pumps;

= added to this is the digital revolution: ‘smart’ solutions have changed
people's relationships with the city, home and car;

= and finally, a cultural and societal transformation is playing out.
Today's consumers are looking for a more thoughtful use of energy
and they want customized low-carbon solutions to manage their
consumption and even produce their own green energy.

ENGIE anticipated this paradigm shift two years ago and adapted its
strategy to guide the Group toward the new energy world. The Group's.
ambition focused on two key themes in 2015:

= to be the benchmark energy player in fast growing markets
= tobe the leader in energy transition in Europe.

In Europe, the Group is adapting to the profound changes taking place
in the energy sector and increasing the priority it gives to its customer
approach.

The Group is restructuring its gas supply portfolio, by optimizing
diversification and renegotiating long-term contracts with its suppliers.

In power generation, the Group continues to rationalize its fleet of
thermal power plants in response to the crisis in thermal generation, and
is campaigning for improvements in European regulations, mainly
through the Magritte Group”, which is calling for measures to preserve
the energy future of Europe.

In renewable energy, the Group aims to pursue its development in
certain countries, with priority given to the more mature technologies:
solar, hydropower, onshore wind power and biomass for electricity and
heat. Partnerships are being sought for these projects.

In infrastructures activities, the aim is to adapt to the energy transition
context:

= by adapting infrastructures to changes in demand and new uses
(mobility, smart grids);

= by preparing infrastructure and commercial offerings for gas being a
vector for renewable energy (biomethane, power to gas, etc.).

ENGIE aims to strengthen its leadership in energy efficiency, as the
benchmark energy partner of its customers, businesses, local authorities
and individuals, emphasizing the technological content of its activities to
provide the most suitable global energy services offering. The Group
also aims to increase its international presence by creating strong local
positions. The aim is to capitalize on countries in which the Group
already operates.

Today, the energy revolution is international and the Group is
accelerating the execution of its strategy. The company plan, which
features a more decentralized organization with a flatter reporting
structure, will guide ENGIE's transformation to become the global leader
of the energy transition.

To this end, as from late February 2016, ENGIE is adapting its business
portfolio to its long-term vision and seizing new growth opportunities in:

= low-carbon activities, which will account for over 90% of the Group's
EBITDA by 2018;

= activities not exposed to commodity prices, so that the share of
contracted/regulated undertakings in the Group's EBITDA is under
85% in 2018;

= integrated solutions for customers, which will see a 50% increase in
EBITDA over the period.

This acceleration is supported by the Group's strong capital structure,
robust cash-flow generation, and the three business segments in which
it has forged leading historical positions:

= power generation from gas and renewable energy;
= energy infrastructure, particularly in natural gas;

= energy supply and service solutions tailored to each type of customer
(business, residential, contractors and public sector).

This faster-paced strategy features a three-year transformation plan with
four objectives:

= to redesign the Group's portfolio, based on its historical positions and
its strong capital structure;

= to improve the Group's performance;

= to prepare the Group's future, particularly by investing in innovation
and new technologies - including digital - in order to offer all
customers new products and services that are in step with the energy
transition;

= to adapt the Group's operations to make it more agile and open to
the outside, by leveraging a streamlined organization that is closer to
the regions.

(2) The Magritte Group, of which ENGIE is a founder member, is an initiative bringing together the CEOs of the 11 biggest energy groups in Europe
(Centrica, CEZ Group, Enel, Eni, E.ON, Fortum, Gas Natural Fenosa, GasTerra, ENGIE, Iberdrola and RWE) to lobby heads of state and government.

ENGIE REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015

This transformation plan is designed to create value and improve the
Group's risk profile. It is based on four key programs:

= a €15 billion (net debt impact) asset rotation program over 2016-2018
which, through disposals, partnerships and/or site closures, will
reduce the Group's exposure to activities that are sensitive to
commodity prices;

= a €22 billion CAPEX program over 2016-2018, including €7 billion for
maintenance expenditure and at least €500 million for innovation,
funded mainly by operating cash flows;

= Lean 2018, an efficiency program that seeks recurring OPEX savings
with a net aggregate impact on EBITDA of €1 billion by 2018;

= anew, €1.5 billion business and digital development program that will
generate significant organic growth by 2018 and beyond.

In this context of transformation, ethics and the safety of people are core
elements of the Group's strategy.

To become more agile and adapt to the trends in its environment, the
Group has been implementing a far-reaching action plan since 2014 that
places human beings at the heart of its transformation in three main
areas:

= developing and advancing our employees (training, responsibilities,
internal mobility);

= animating the Group and spreading its values;

Presentation of the Group
1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

enhancing performance to serve our customers (innovation,
managing complexity) and rolling out a new code of conduct for
managers, the “Management Way”.

On the financial front, the Group prioritizes maintaining a sound financial
structure in the long term (aiming to retain an “A” credit rating), which will
mainly be achieved through strict investment criteria. ENGIE’s financial
objective is to offer its shareholders attractive returns while maintaining a
solid financial structure and robust cash flow generation (see
Section 6.1.1.7 “Outlook”).

Within ENGIE, environmental and societal responsibility plays an integral
part in drawing up business strategy, through the development of:

= sustainable business, which involves identifying environmental and
societal issues and transforming them into opportunities for the
Group’s businesses;

= the management of non-financial risks, which involves managing the
risks associated with the Group's activities and facilities that relate to
the environment, local and international acceptability, health and
safety, human resources management, ethics and governance.

ENGIE has formalized its sustainable development commitments, mainly
‘through the publication of its policy in 2014.

In May 2014, ENGIE issued a green bond for a total amount of
€2.5 billion. This bond loan has helped to finance the Group's
development in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects (see
Section 5.1.6.4 “Green bond").

1.1.5 Improving performance

Perform 2015 was launched in 2012 to support the deployment of the
Group's strategy and to improve its performance in a sustainable
manner. The overall gross target of the program’ was increased to
€4.5 billion cumulatively over the 2012-2015 period in order to support
the acceleration in the Group's transformation and to deal with an
on-going difficult economic environment in Europe.

The results of the Perform 2015 program amounted to €5.8 billion,
exceeding the initial target by 30%. In 2015, the program had a gross
positive impact of €0.6 billion on income essentially associated with
defined actions in terms of operational efficiency and Opex optimization.
The portion affecting recurring net income, Group share stood at
€135 million.

In view of adverse exogenous events (major decline in oil and gas prices
in early 2015), the Group launched the Quick Reaction Plan (QRP) to
reduce its operating costs, which totaled €250 million in 2015.

The year was marked by ongoing performance improvement initiatives,
particularly the rationalization of the real estate portfolio in France and
Belgium. Reducing assets from 13 sites in Brussels to two — Engie
Towers and Ariane - generated a financial gain of €48 million in
2014-2015.

Opex savings in terms of purchases in 2015 amounted to €380 million,
following the introduction of Category Management through the One For
Value program. (As an example, reducing gas turbine maintenance
purchases generated savings of €25 million in OPEX and in CAPEX for
the Group in 2015).

In 2016, the Group is launching an ambitious performance program
called “Lean 2018" with a cumulative net impact on EBITDA of €1 billion
by 2018. This target is 50% higher than Perform 2015 (on annual basis)
The new program is the next stage in ongoing efforts to enhance
performance, and is designed to create recurring gains on Group
operating costs.

(1) The term “gross” applies specifically to the component of the objective relating to operating costs, thus €2.6 billion for the program. A gross gain is by
nature recurring, from which implementation costs are deducted but prior to inflation, other costs and taxes.

1.1.6 Competitive positioning

Electricity generation and marketing, as well as gas marketing are
business sectors that are broadly open to competition in Europe, while
their regulation continues to vary by country, especially when it comes to
prices for residential customers. Activities that constitute natural
monopolies — such as the transmission and distribution of electricity and,
to a large extent, of gas - are more tightly controlled by domestic
regulators and European rules.

Elsewhere in the world, with few exceptions, private players often
operate under long-term contracts issued on a tender basis.

ENGIE is a European and world leader in electricity and natural gas:

= in Europe, ENGIE is the No. 3 seller” of natural gas. In LNG, ENGIE is
a global player. It is the No.1 importer in Europe and the No. 5
importer®! in the world. It is also a major player in exploration and
production;

= the Group is the leading gas infrastructure operator in Europe: it has
the No. 2 transmission network, is No.1 in distribution, European
No. 1 in storage capacity (in terms of useful storage) and the No. 2
owner/operator of LNG terminals. It also owns Turkey's No. 3 gas
distributor;

= in electricity, the merger of ENGIE and International Power created
the world's leading independent power producer (IPP). The

transaction also reinforces the Group's international standing as the
No. 1 producer-developer in the Gulf States, the No. 1 IPP in Brazil
and Thailand, No. 2 in Peru and No.3 in Chile. The Group is the
No. 6 producer" and the No. 7 supplier” in Europe.

This global and European leadership is fortified by the Group's deep
Franco-Belgian roots:

@ in France, ENGIE is the historic leader of gas marketing and the No. 2
producer and supplier” of electricity. In renewable energy, ENGIE is
the No.2 hydropower operator in France and the leader in wind
power;

@ in Belgium, ENGIE, through its subsidiary Electrabel, is the No. 1
producer and supplier of electricity”! and the No. 1 supplier of natural
gas"

The Group is also the European leader in B2B energy services: the
Energy Services business line is ranked joint No. 1 in France, Belgium,
the Netherlands and Italy’ ENGIE also has strong positions in Germany,
Switzerland, Austria, Spain and the UK in heating networks (where it is
No. 1), as well as facility management since the acquisition of Balfour
Beatty WorkPlace. Lastly, it has set up the initial bases for development
in Central Europe, Asia, North America and Latin America.

1.2.2.2 Natural gas portfolio

Most of the Group’s natural gas is supplied via one of the most
diversified portfolios of long-term contracts in Europe, sourced from
more than 10 countries. These contracts give ENGIE the necessary
visibility to ensure its development and secure its supplies. ENGIE is also
one of the biggest spot market players in Europe. It can therefore
rationalize its supply costs by adjusting its purchasing to match its
needs.

The Group's portfolio, which represents approximately 1,132 TWh
(calculated at group share) ", or about 105 billion m®, is among the most
diversified in the world. LNG represents about 13% of the portfolio.

(1) The group share calculation includes the capacities at their percentage of consolidation for full and proportionally consolidated affiliates and at their
percentage of holding for companies accounted for using the equity method.

1.2.3 Non-financial indicators

The Group's non-financial performance is based on dated and
quantified targets and an overall assessment organized around different
resources (high level of governance, reporting, scorecard, performance
reviews and non-financial indicators).

The Board of Directors’ Ethics, Environment and Sustainable
Development Committee defines the scope of the policies undertaken,
outlooks and action plans in the area of corporate societal responsibility.
The Group’s Management Committee makes key decisions in this area
(see Section 4. “Corporate governance”). The role of the Group's
Environmental and Societal Responsibility Executive Committee is to
prepare annual action plans, monitor their implementation, gather
experiences across the various entities and encourage exchange on
major strategies.

A non-financial scorecard made up of key indicators covering the three
bases of Societal and Environmental Responsibility is presented to the
Group's Management Committee for approval and future direction, then
to the Ethics, Environment and Sustainable Development Committee to
provide a progress report on implementation of the policy and
achievement of the Group's non-financial objectives.

Regarding environmental targets, ENGIE’s specific CO, emissions in
2015 were stable compared to 2012 (see Section 3.3.4.1 “Climate
change’), in line with forecasts. This was due to the full-year operation of
the coal-fired plants in Maassvlakte (Netherlands) and Wilhemshaven
(Germany). With regard to the targeted increase of 50% over 2009 set
for installed capacity of renewable energy, this was exceeded (+60%).

Of the 179 sites considered to be a priority in Europe for biodiversity,
176 (98.3%) validated their targeted action plan, almost meeting the
target of 100%. Only three sites still have a plan under discussion.

With regard to social or governance targets, ENGIE's employee accident
frequency rate in 2015 was 3.6 (see Section 3.2.6 “Health and safety
policy"), below the target of 4. Its training rate of 66% is on target, even
though the rate was 64% with the inclusion of UK subsidiaries Cofely
Workplace and Cofely Ltd, acquired in 2014 and which have not yet
implemented the Group's training policy. The Group almost reached the
target of 3% employee share ownership, at 2.7%. This was due to the
fact that no employee share ownership plan was launched in 2015.
However, the target had been exceeded in 2014 at 3.18% (see
Section 3.2.4.3 “Employee shareholding”). The four targets set for
gender equality in 2015 have also been almost fully met: the rate of
female hires was up by 5% to reach 25% versus a target of 30%; the
rate of female managers was 22% versus a target of 25%; the rate of
female “high potentials” continued to rise, reaching 28.4% versus a
target of 35%; and lastly, the rate of women appointed to senior
management was 30%, very close to the target of 33%.

In its investment projects, the Group incorporates ten extra-financial
criteria relating to ethics, CO, emissions, social impact, human
resources, environmental management of ecosystems, cooperation with
stakeholders, local purchasing, and health and safety. Furthermore, the
Group takes a CO, cost into account for its investments.

The Group's social reporting (see Section 3.2 “Social information”),
environmental reporting (see Section 3.3 “Environmental information”)
and societal reporting (see Section3.4 “Corporate societal
commitments"), form the basis of a published Group of indicators that
are verified by an independent third party.

In 2015, ENGIE was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and
Europe Indices, established by extra-financial rating agency
RobecoSAM. The Group's inclusion in these indices places it in the top
10% of sustainability-driven companies in the “Multi- and Water Utilities”
segment. The Group was given a C+ rating by Oekom in 2014 and is
ranked by the Vigeo rating agency. ENGIE is included in the following

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

1.3.1.6 Description of activities

1.3.1.6.1 Central Western Europe

Central Energy Management Trading (Central EMT)

Energy Management Trading (EMT) is designed to structure the portfolio
of assets (physical and contractual), negotiate the corresponding
contracts, optimize the management of these assets, and provide
support to the Group's commercial operations in Europe.

EMT is structured around four activities: Portfolio & Risk Management
(PRM), Optimization & Prompt (O&P), Origination & Sales Support (OSS),
and Trading.

EMT mainly operates for the Energy Europe business line and also
supports other Group business lines, notably in exploration and
production, LNG, and coal supply.

Portfolio and Risk Management (PRM)

The business line manages several assets throughout Europe, including
power plants, virtual power plants, gas and electricity sourcing or supply
contracts, transmission capacity, storage rights, and regasification
capacity.

PRM develops an integrated, multi-year policy for these assets and
defines strategies to reduce the price risks associated with them. This
policy is then implemented by the Optimization and Prompt teams. PRM
helps to optimize the portfolio’s risk/reward profile and to ensure the
profitability of the assets.

Optimization and Prompt (O&P)

Within the scope of the business line’s risk policy, O&P optimizes the
gas and electricity portfolios over different time horizons, using a wide
variety of models. Exposure to price and volume risks is gradually
reduced until physical delivery, by systematic transfer to Trading, while
ensuring sufficient capacity to handle fluctuations in production, supply
and consumption.

ENGIE has the legal obligation, as with all natural gas suppliers, to
supply all its French customers without a contingency clause: to be able
to provide physical delivery in the event of severe weather conditions
that statistically occur no more than twice a century - known as “2%
risk”.

O8&P identifies flexibility in the portfolio in order to structure it as options
and market products to be transferred to Trading.

O&P also manages all logistics (transmission and storage capacity, etc.)
until physical delivery of energy to the various operators.

Origination and Sales Support (OSS)

OSS is responsible for the energy supply to the commercial entities of
Marketing & Sales, commercial relations with counterparties (excluding
market counterparties), mainly gas suppliers, and the sale of electricity
and gas to large industrial customers (Giant accounts).

Long-term gas contracts

OSS purchases natural gas under long-term contracts from its main
suppliers. The aim of the supply strategy is to ensure the
competitiveness of the portfolio and security of supply to the Group’s.
customers, mainly through geographical diversification of resources and
constant adaptation of the portfolio to the market situation.

In line with market practice, long-term procurement contracts contain
volume clauses: minimum volumes to be taken in a period (take-or-pay),
transfer of withdrawals to a later period (make-up), or deduction of
volumes withdrawn against a prior period (carry forward).

The contracts contain clauses that enable periodic revision of prices
according to changes in the market, either on a regular basis or by way
of exception. The parties are then required to negotiate in good faith and
may, in the event of disagreement, revert to arbitration

In 2015, EMT continued to renegotiate contracts with its main suppliers
to adapt these contracts to new market conditions. As of December 31,
2015, over 60% of the long-term contract portfolio volumes in Europe
were indexed to the price of gas sold on the spot market.

Global Energy

Global Energy is Energy Europe’s entity in charge of sales of gas,
electricity and associated services to national and pan-European large
industrial customers. Global Energy develops full supply offers
(commodity, flexibility, balancing and delivery), market products (blocks
delivered to the hub or financial products), pricing engineering
consultancy, risk management solutions, and services related to the
energy transition.

Own commercial activity with market counterparties

OSS is also developing its own commercial activity for customers active
on the wholesale market (e.g. other energy groups, major consumers.
directly active in the markets, banks, etc.).

Trading

Trading provides the business line with access to all energy markets as
well as the currency market.

Trading helps to optimize assets by managing positions from O&P in the
markets, and supports the commercial operations of OSS. Trading also
develops proprietary trading operations within lower risk limits.

Lastly, Trading is in charge of international trading activities, as well as
the physical procurement of coal and biomass for the power plants of
the Energy Europe business line and a portion of those of the Energy
International business line.

ENGIE Global Markets (formely GDF SUEZ Trading - GST)
and GDF SUEZ Energy Management Trading (GSEMT)

The market activities of O&P, OSS and Trading are carried out by ENGIE
Global Markets (formely GDF SUEZ Trading), a subsidiary with
“investment services provider" status supervised by the banking and
financial authorities, and by GDF SUEZ Energy Management Trading.
These two structures are wholly owned by the Group.

16 ENGIE REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015


--- Page 14 ---

EMT's activities have a dedicated and specialized risk control system,
with teams responsible for defining risk assessment procedures,
proposing credit and market limits, monitoring risk assessment tools,
and monitoring market risks on a daily basis.

The system is incorporated in ENGIE's governance through an EMT Risk
Committee (EMTRC) comprising senior managers of GDF SUEZ Trading
and representatives of the Group and the business line. EMTRC.
monitors all risks to which EMT is exposed.

Market risks (commodity prices, FOREX rates and interest rate risks) and
physical risks (asset failure risks) are monitored based on VaR (value at
risk) and stress test models.

Regarding credit risks, lines of credit are allocated counterparty by
counterparty. These risks are reduced through the implementation of
various tools, such as netting agreements and margin calls, obtaining
first-demand guarantees and parent company guarantees, and
transaction clearing.

Operational risks are managed by a specialized team that ensures
systematic improvement in internal procedures.

Liquidity risk is assessed by stress tests.

General Management and EMTRC are automatically notified if a limit is
overrun.

The efficiency of the risk control framework is regularly tested in audits.

The risk control framework for market activities is part of this system and
meets all the regulatory requirements.

France
The Energy Europe business line has a firm base in France where it has
a large portfolio of activities.

The Generation Métier operates four combined-cycle gas plants in
France. Three units (Montoir-de-Bretagne, Combigolfe and Cycofos
PL2) have been under summer or annual mothballing since April 2013.
The Cycofos PL1 combined-cycle plant (428 MW) was restarted in
October after a prolonged period of mothballing (two years)

The Renewable Energies Métier is responsible for the Group's
development in this domain. In 2015, ENGIE increased its capacity in
France by 254 MW, comprising 189 MW from onshore wind farms,
7 MW from hydroelectricity, and 59 MW") from photovoltaic solar.
Under a partnership between ENGIE and Predica, Crédit Agricole’s life
insurance subsidiary, 90 MW of additional wind power projects were
developed in 2015. Following the allocation of two offshore wind farm
projects to ENGIE and its partners in May 2014, a public debate
phase took place in Dieppe-Le Tréport (April-July) and in Noirmoutier-lle
d'Yeu (May-August). ENGIE is also continuing to explore marine energy,
notably at the tidal energy pilot farm at Raz Blanchard. In addition, as
part of the third solar tender launched by France’s Energy Regulatory
Commission, ENGIE was awarded 14 photovoltaic projects through its
subsidiaries Solairedirect, La Compagnie Nationale du Rhdéne, La
Compagnie du Vent and Futures Energies, accounting for 95.5 MW of
installed capacity.

In March 2016, ENGIE signed a contract for the acquisition of the
remaining 51% of MAIA EOLIS, a company specialized in the

development, construction, operation and maintenance of wind farms in
France. The Group, which already had 49% ownership of the company,
thus brings its stake to 100% (subject to satisfaction of conditions
precedent once the transaction is finalized).

The Marketing & Sales Métier remains the leading seller of natural gas in
France (150.1 TWh"!sold in 2015), despite intense competition,
particularly in the B2B segment. The Group maintained its advantage
over alternative power suppliers (21.9°TWh sold in 2015) and
expanded even faster in 2015, particularly among B2C customers
(2.7 million customers at the end of 2015). ENGIE also holds positions
across the home energy efficiency value chain, including energy audits,
advice, financing of works, design, and equipment installation and
maintenance (leader in maintenance, with 1.9 million contracts). In
addition, the ENGIE brand was launched on the B2C markets in 2015.

Regulatory framework

A decree defining the rules of a capacity mechanism to secure France's
power supply was signed on January 23, 2015. The European
Commission began an inquiry into the mechanism for state aid on
November 13, 2015. The Commission’s acceptance of the mechanism
is contingent at the least on whether the mechanism allows
cross-border capacity trading and on broader adoption of the remedies
defined by France’s competition authorities in 2012 to counteract the
dominant market position of EDF. Consequently, the mechanism is not
expected to be implemented until 2018 instead of 2017.

Meanwhile, the Energy Transition For Green Growth Act was ratified on
August 17, 2015. The legislation sets ambitious targets for France: a
40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels,
a 30% reduction in fossil fuel consumption by 2030 from 2012 levels, an
increase in the share of renewable energy to 32% of final energy
consumption and 40% of power generation by 2030, and a reduction of
the share of nuclear power in the energy mix to 50%.

Lastly, a public service agreement signed in November in application of
the law specifically binds ENGIE and the French government. The Group
has reaffirmed its commitments to the energy transition by developing
renewables (particularly solar, wind and biogas), promoting energy
efficiency, and controlling energy consumption (by underwriting the “Live
Better” program for low-income households, and developing incentives
for home renovations to increase energy efficiency). ENGIE has also
renewed its commitment to provide high-quality customer service, to
ensure gas supply security and to fight energy poverty (for example, by
offering assistance to low-income consumers, monitoring the time taken
to process claims, and checking the quality of service offered by its
contractor partners). In return, the French government will establish and
apply a legislative, regulatory and contractual framework offering the
visibility and stability the Group needs for its activities, including cost
coverage through regulated tariffs.

Sale price of natural gas

ENGIE sells natural gas on the basis of two pricing systems: regulated
tariffs and negotiated prices for customers who have opted out of
regulated tariffs in favor of market offers from energy suppliers.

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

Proportion of regulated tariffs in the sales portfolio

45% of ENGIE’s total gas sales" are priced on the basis of tariffs
established by the government through various acts, decrees and
regulatory decisions.

Regulated tariffs

In accordance with Article 11 bis of the Consumer Rights Act, regulated
tariffs for natural gas and electricity ended on December 31, 2015 for
business customers. In 2015 this measure affected about 100,000 gas
customers.

As of January 1, 2016:

in the gas market, regulated tariffs remain only for retail customers,
small businesses (annual consumption below 30 MWh) and small
co-owned properties (annual consumption below 150 MWh);

@ in the electricity market, only the “Blue” regulated tariffs remain (for
retail customers and small businesses).

At the beginning of 2015, there were still two types of regulated tariffs:

= public distribution tariffs for customers connected to the distribution
network (6.4 million customers ®!; 73 TWh sold in 2015);

= subscription tariffs for high-use customers connected either to the
distribution network or directly to the transmission network. These
tariffs were discontinued on July 1, 2015 after customers shifted to
market offers. In 2015 only few customers benefitted from these
tariffs and sales volumes were very low.

Tariff-setting procedure

Tariffs are set in France under the Energy Act and the decree of
December 18, 2009, as amended on May 16, 2013, concerning
regulated tariffs for natural gas sales. These provisions state that prices
must cover corresponding costs. The regulator (Commission de
régulation de |I'énergie - CRE) audits supply and non-supply costs for
ENGIE every year, and makes recommendations for tariff changes
accordingly. On July 1 each year, the government publishes an order
setting out the formula representing the changes in supply costs and the
tariff levels. Since July1, 2015, the pricing formula includes an
indexation of 77% on gas market prices, the remainder being pegged to
il product indices and to the euro-dollar exchange rate.

In the interval between any two governmental orders, ENGIE, after
advice from the CRE, can pass on changes in supply costs resulting
from the application of the pricing formula each month. If there is an
exceptional rise in oil or natural gas products, the government may issue
an order, after advice from the CRE, temporarily setting tariffs that are
below ENGIE’s costs for a period of no more than one year.

(1) Including large industrial customers.

(2) Average on a yearly basis.

In 2015 (12 monthly changes), regulated tariffs and public distribution
rates decreased by 9.7%. Regulated subscription tariffs were last
published in July 2015.

Belgium-Luxembourg
In Belgium, ENGIE’s wholly-owned subsidiary Electrabel is the leading
player in the power sector.

At year-end 2015, the Generation Métier operated a capacity of
9,101 MW, including 4,377 MW in nuclear power units (including
drawing rights), and 2,637 MW in natural gas-fired thermal power plants.
In Luxembourg, the Métier operates the Esch-sur-Alzette plant
(876 MW), which was added to the strategic reserve in 2015. The
closure of the Drogenbos GT & CCGT and Awirs 4 units (48 MW,
460 MW and 95 MW, in Belgium), initially planned for 2015, was.
postponed until later dates. The Generation Métier also operates various.
cogeneration units for industrial customers. The contract with Bayer was.
renewed for a 10-year term and includes operations and maintenance
(O&M) services. The Solvay cogeneration unit in Jemeppes-sur-Sambre
was transferred to Solvay at the end of the contract. Solvay and
Electrabel signed an agreement to provide O&M services to the site.

At the end of 2015 the Renewable Energies Métier operated onshore
wind capacity of 212 MW. Six new projects representing a total installed
capacity of 40 MW were commissioned at the end of 2015. Other
projects representing a total installed capacity of 39 MW are under
construction and expected to enter into service in the second half of
2016. As part of the development of its onshore wind assets, Electrabel
signed a partnership agreement with a number of Belgian municipalities
to create two joint ventures in Flanders and Wallonia (Wind4Flanders.
and Wind4Wallonia). ENGIE is also a partner in Greensky, along with
Infrabel (the Belgian railway infrastructure manager) and other
companies, to develop a wind farm along the high-speed Louvain-Liége
train line. The farm will eventually become one of the largest in Belgium.
With regard to offshore wind power, the Mermaid project (North Sea)
reached an administrative milestone when the Belgian state awarded it
an environmental permit and license to build and operate the farm.

Following the presentation of a report proving the unprofitability of the
Awirs biomass plant, the Wallonian regulator revised the green
certificates support system for the next five years. This should lead to
benchmark profitability of 9% (IRR). An annual review is planned.

repositioning, marketing initiatives, improvement of operating
performance) continued to yield results in 2015, stabilizing market share.
Lastly, the Marketing & Sales Métier develops a range of innovative
products and services for all customer categories (insulation, home
boiler replacement, smart technologies, development of natural gas
service stations in partnership with local actors...).

In Wallonia, the finalization agreement providing for Electrabel's early
withdrawal from Ores Assets on December 31, 2016 (instead of
year-end 2019 as originally planned) was adopted at the end of
May 2015. The memorandum of understanding also provided for the
public partners’ exit from the capital of Electrabel Customer Solutions,
effective December 31, 2014.

ENGIE, EDF and the Belgian state signed an agreement in March 2014
governing the extension of the lifetime of the Tihange 1 nuclear plant: the
investment program to safely continue operating this plant through 2025
is being implemented. The margin sharing mechanism defined in the
agreement in substitution of the fixed nuclear contribution tax has been
applicable since October 2015.

The Act of June 28, 2015 authorizes the 10-year extension of operations
at Doel 1 & 2. A royal decree dated September 27, 2015 supplementing
the operating terms and conditions for the Doel 1 and Doel 2 nuclear
reactors as part of their long-term operation was published, as was a
decision by the AFCN on September 30, 2015 regarding the LTO.
(long-term operation) action plan for Doel 1 and Doel 2. ENGIE and the
Belgian state signed an agreement on November 30, 2015 to extend the
operating terms of the two reactors. Under the agreement, Electrabel
must pay the Belgian state an annual charge of €20 million from 2016
to 2025 in exchange for the extension of Doel 1 & 2. The agreement
also provides for a new nuclear contribution tax system until 2026 for
the Doel 3 & 4 and Tihange 2 & 3 nuclear reactors. The agreement’s
entry into force is contingent on the adoption of two bills before July 31,
2016.

Against this backdrop, the Doel 1 unit (shut down on February 15, 2015)
restarted on December 30, 2015 and the Doel 2 unit (shut down on
October 23, 2015) restarted on December 25, 2015.

In November, the AFCN authorized the safe restart of the Doel 3 and
Tihange 2 nuclear plants, shut down since March 2014 after the
detection of flaws formed during the tank forging phase. An extensive
series of tests and inspections revealed that these flaws were
attributable to hydrogen and did not affect the tank's structural integrity,
which was guaranteed in any case. Consequently, the AFCN granted
permission to restart the two plants in December (Doel3 on
December 21, 2015 and Tihange 2 on December 14, 2015).

Thermal power generation

To ensure the security of Belgium's energy supply in the medium and
long term, discussions are under way with the office of the Energy
Minister and her administration. A strategic reserve has been set up for
the 2014-2017 winters and proposals are expected for the introduction
of a capacity remuneration mechanism for new and existing generation
facilities.

Germany
The Energy Europe business line operates in Germany through its power
generation and energy sales activities.

The Generation Métier currently operates 1,924 MW of gas and coal
capacity in Germany, of which 1,619 MW comes from the Farge, Zolling
and Wilhelmshaven power plants (mainly coal) and 603 MW from
nuclear drawing rights. The Métier also manages 431 MW_ of
cogeneration plants owned and operated by municipal utilities
(Energieversorgung GeraGmbH and Kraftwerke Gera GmbH,
EnergieSaarLorLux AG, WSW Energie &Wasser AG, and GASAG
Berliner Gaswerke AG). The supercritical coal-fired plant in
Wilhelmshaven (731 MW) was commissioned in October.

At the end of 2015, ENGIE operated in Germany an installed onshore
wind capacity of 196 MW and hydroelectric facilities of 142 MW. In
2015, power at the hydroelectric pumped-storage plant in Pfreimd was
increased by 6 MW after the plant underwent a major upgrade.

The Marketing & Sales Métier operates on most customer segments.
B2B sales amounted to 13.6 TWh of electricity and 7.8 TWh of natural
gas. The Group is also active in the sale and distribution of electricity,
gas and heat to residential and small business customers, through its
investments in municipal utilities. In June, ENGIE and Vattenfall signed a
consortium agreement for joint control of GASAG. This agreement was
approved by the European Commission in December, covers a term of
20 years and will not take full effect until 2020-2021. The dispute
between GASAG and Land Berlin relating to the tenders for the renewal
of the gas network concession is still ongoing.

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

After initiating the process of legislative debate on electricity market
reform in 2013, the government published a white paper of its proposals
in July, followed by a draft bill in September. The debate is expected to
continue in 2016 with the aim of implementing reform in 2017. The
purpose is to improve the functioning of the energy market through 20
so-called “no-regret” measures (particularly uncapped market prices,
better adapting the markets to renewable energy and to the need for
flexibility, for example balancing/intraday markets, and greater
integration at the European level). A reserve capacity of up to 4.4 GW
and a “climate” reserve of 2.7 GW grouping together old lignite-fired
plants are also part of the reform package. Furthermore, gas-fired
cogeneration plants should receive stronger support.

Netherlands
ENGIE is a leading player in the Dutch energy market.

At year-end 2015 the Generation Métier operated an installed capacity
of 4,402 MW comprised of several gas- and coal-fired plants. The Eems.
6 and Flevo 5 plants (859 MW and 438MW, respectively) were
seasonally mothballed. The Gelderland and Harculo HC62_ plants
(692 MW and 86 MW respectively) were shut down on January 1, 2016.
The new supercritical coal-fired plant in Rotterdam, with a capacity of
731 MW and connected to the grid since 2014, entered into service on
January 29, 2015. The energy agreement on “sustainable growth",
signed in 2013 by the Dutch government and members of the Social
and Economic Council, provided in particular for the closure of several
coal-fired plants (including Gelderland, wholly owned by the Group)
before January 1, 2016, and the elimination of the coal tax for the
remaining plants after January 1, 2016.

ENGIE is expanding its renewable energy activities. At year-end 2015,
the Renewable Energies Métier operated an onshore wind capacity of
56 MW. In 2015, ENGIE built and commissioned two solar energy plants
on the Gelderland (Nijmegen) and Harculo (Zwolle) sites for total power
of approximately 2 MW. The projects were open to financial investments.
from ENGIE customers.

The Marketing & Sales Métier is also active on the Dutch market.
Through Electrabel, it supplies gas and power to more than 0.5 million
retail customers. In the B2B segment, ENGIE is a major supplier with
sales of 5.1 TWh of electricity and 6.2 TWh of gas.

ENGIE also develops comprehensive offers for carriers (road, inland
waterway and sea), from sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to
deployment of new refueling facilities. In 2015 the Group increased its
number of LNG filling stations, signing agreements to build 10 stations in
the Netherlands as well as open its first station for trucks.

1.3.1.6.2 Eastern and Southern Europe

Poland

In Poland, the Energy Europe business line is mainly active in power
generation.

At year-end 2015, the Generation Métier operated 1,717 MW,
comprising coal-fired capacity in Polaniec of 1,527 MW and capacity of
190 MW for the Green Unit biomass facility, which is one of the largest
biomass units in the world. ENGIE is upgrading its generation units to
increase their capacity and efficiency and bring them in line with the
European Industrial Emissions Directive. Units 1, 2, 3, 6 and7 were
modernized in 2013 and 2014. The upgrade of unit 4 was completed in
2015; upgrading of unit 5 has been postponed.

(1) 8.5 MW through the acquisition of Novenergia.

The Renewable Energies Métier has 147 MW of installed onshore wind
power, distributed across the sites of JarMoltowo, Wartkowo,
Gluchow" and Pagow. The Dabrowice wind farm (86 MW) was
commissioned in December.

The regulatory environment for renewable energy has changed
significantly for new projects. On January 1, 2016, the government
replaced the former green certificates trading system with a system of
contracts for difference defined over 15 years through an auction
system based on a benchmark price for each technology. Existing
assets can choose to stay within the current green certificates system or
participate in specific auctions to benefit from the new system. Co-firing
will continue to benefit from green certificates although the number of
certificates awarded will be halved.

The Marketing & Sales Métier focuses on the sale of electricity to B2B
customers (0.6 TWh sold in 2016).

Hungary

ENGIE operates in Hungary through its subsidiary GDF SUEZ Energy
Holding Hungary and Egaz-Dégaz.

In September, ENGIE sold its gas sales operations (753,000 residential
customers) to Févarosi Gazmtivek Zrt (Fégaz), which became the new
majority shareholder of GDF SUEZ Energia Magyarorszag Zrt (GSEM)

In February 2015, ENGIE sent a Notice of Dispute to the Justice Ministry
following the Energy Charter Treaty. The notice concerned Egéz-Dégaz,
a natural gas distributor with a distribution network of 23,184 km and
13.7 TWh of natural gas distributed to 774,000 customers in 2015.
Negotiations initiated in June 2015 regarding the acquisition of
Egaz-Dégaz by the Hungarian authorities are still ongoing

Romania

The Energy Europe business line is responsible for the sale and
distribution of natural gas and is expanding its activities in power.

Since the end of 2013, the Renewable Energies Métier has managed
two wind farms, for installed capacity of 98 MW. These farms are
located in Gemenele (Braila region) and Baleni (Galati region). The
regulatory framework has been deteriorating since the end of 2013,
having a negative impact on the profitability of wind assets. However,
amendments made in May 2015 to the law governing renewable energy
support mechanisms clarified the position of wind energy producers.

The core business consists of supplying gas to 1.6 million customers
located mostly in the southern and eastern parts of the country via
Distrigaz and CONGAZ. The Group supplies electricity to about 2,150
industrial and commercial customers. Its subsidiary Distrigaz Sud Retele
operates a distribution network of 17,743 km, and CONGAZ, a network
of 950 km. The Group strengthened its position in CONGAZ by
acquiring the 13.95% stake held by Petroconst, the main minority
shareholder. This takes the Group's shareholding from 85.77% to
99.72%. ENGIE is also active in the energy services sector serving
655,000 customers through Distrigaz Confort, with a focus on
maintenance of home installations. Energy Europe is also present in
natural gas storage, mainly through its subsidiary Depomures, which has.
a total operating capacity of 300 million cubic meters.

Romania is in the midst of deregulating electricity and gas prices. To
support the process of gas market deregulation, the regulator requires
producers (between 2015 and 2018) and suppliers (between 2015 and
2016) to make a portion of their portfolio available to a centralized
market. The transition to full deregulation of gas prices for the
non-residential sector was completed on September 1, 2015. ENGIE
successfully switched over its customers following the opening up of the
B2B market, keeping a significant market share. Moreover in the
perspective of the future deregulation of the B2C market, the
government adopted in July a new framework aimed at gradually
bringing gas prices (energy portion) in the Romanian market in line with
those of the European markets. ENGIE continues to encourage the
authorities to manage the transition to a deregulated gas market as
optimally as possible.

Austria & Czech Republic

ENGIE is active in the Austrian and Czech Republic natural gas markets.
Gas volumes sold amount to almost 1.0 TWh and 1.7 TWh, respectively.

Italy & Greece
In Italy, Energy Europe operates in power generation and energy sales.

The Generation Métier directly operates 1,526 MW (through majority
stakes in thermal assets) and holds a 50% stake in Tirenno Power
S.p.A, which manages 3,276 MW. Energy Europe also holds 1,100 MW.
of drawing rights. Total capacity breaks down as 5,236 MW for gas and
591 MW for coal. Vado Ligure units 3 and 4, owned by Tirreno Power,
were shut down in March 2014 by order of the court of Savona. The
Italian Environment Minister subsequently suspended authorization to
operate these units ",

Political discussions on a major revision of the institutional framework on
conventional generation are ongoing. A centralized capacity mechanism
has been in the process of design since 2011. The Italian Economic
Development Ministry is in discussion with the European Commission
regarding the amendments proposed by the national regulator which will
modify the current system.

The Renewable Energies Métier also manages 158 MW of wind assets
and 5 MW of photovoltaic assets. In addition, the Group manages
75 MW of hydraulic facilities through Tirreno Power.

The Marketing & Sales Métier sells gas and electricity to different market
segments (residential and B2B), for a total of 0.9 million contracts, of
which 0.1 million are dual offers (electricity and gas). A bill proposing the
elimination of regulated tariffs from 2018 is currently under discussion in
parliament. At the same time, the Italian energy regulator wants to set
up a system for faster transfer to the open market, particularly for
business customers. In the B2B market, the introduction in 2015 of

mandatory energy audits for some customer categories allowed ENGIE
to position itself in the energy efficiency market.

In Greece, Energy Europe is mainly present through two joint ventures
with GEK TERNA (a Greek private company) for Heron | and Il power
plants, for a total capacity of 570 MW. The business line is also active in
the B2B electricity market.

Spain
In Spain, Energy Europe is active in power generation, energy
management, and sales (power, gas & bidding services for third parties).

The Generation Métier has an installed net capacity in Spain of
1,990 MW with two natural gas combined-cycle power plants:
Castelnou (791 MW) and Cartagena (1,199 MW). The energy of both
power plants is sold on the wholesale market.

The business line operates hydroelectric (65 MW) and solar (22 MW)
assets °

Marketing & Sales activity is focused on the industrial market with
2.4 TWh sold in gas and 2.5 TWh in electricity.

The law on hydrocarbons adopted in May 2015 provides for an
organized natural gas market, now in place since December. In addition,
operational procedures allowing renewable energy to participate in
ancillary services were approved in December 2015 and came into force
in February 2016.

Portugal

Energy Europe's activities in Portugal are mainly focused on power
generation and natural gas distribution. The Group operates through a
joint venture with Marubeni (Trustenergy) for its thermal and renewable
energy generation.

The Generation Métier has an installed thermal power capacity of
2,406 MW, of which 1,830 MW comes from gas-fired combined-cycle
plants and 576 MW from one coal-fired plant.

The Renewable Energies Métier also manages 963 MW from renewable
assets (mainly wind) through interests held by Trustenergy in companies
such as Lusovento HoldingB.V. and Generg SGPS. In
September 2015, Trustenergy took a minority stake in the Windplus
consortium, partnering with EDP-R, Repsol, Mitshubishi Heavy
Industries and Chiyoda to develop a pilot project (WindFloat Atlantic).
The consortium will build a floating wind farm off the coast of Portugal
with power generation capacity of 25 MW.

In January 2016, ENGIE finalized the sale of its 25.35% stake in Portgas
to the EDP group. Portgas markets and distributes natural gas and
propane in a concession in northern Portugal.

The business line follows a matrix organization structure, which provides
the regional teams with both the flexibility and the responsibility to run
and develop their businesses, while the functional support teams ensure
direction and consistency, and help optimize synergies across the
regions and the Group.

The regions interact with the business line headquarters through six
functional support departments: Strategy & Communications, Finance,
Business Development Oversight, Legal, HR and responsibilities of the
Chief Operating Officer (Operations, Markets & Sales and IT). The
functional support managers and their teams provide supervision,
guidance, common methodologies and procedures, suggestions for
improvements, as well as knowledge and experience gathered from
across the organization to the regional teams.

(2) GW and MW always stand for the maximum net technical capacity of the power plants, which corresponds to the gross power less auto
consumption. Installed capacity corresponds to 100% of the total capacity of all interests held by ENGIE irrespective of the actual percentage stake of

the holding.

(3) Projects under construction include the projects not yet under construction but for which the company is contractually bound to build or acquire.

(4) A system-play approach is an approach which seeks to create industrial synergies alongside our investments in power generation through investing in
closely linked businesses, such as LING terminals, gas distribution and energy retail (largely for commercial and industrial customers).

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

Argentina

In Argentina, ENGIE holds a 64.2% interest in Litoral Gas SA, a gas
distribution company which has a market share of 12% in terms of
volume delivered in the region of Santa Fé and in the Northeast of the
province of Buenos Aires. In addition, it holds a 46.7% interest in Energy
Consulting Services (ECS), an electricity and gas sales and consultancy
company. ENGIE also holds an interest in Gasoducto Norandino, a gas
transmission company with a pipeline of approximately 1,000 km
between Argentina and Chile, which is 100% owned by E-CL.

The government suspended the application of the pre-existing
regulatory framework through the declaration of a state of economic
emergency in 2002. This implied a tariff freeze and a reduction of tariffs
in dollar terms due to local currency devaluation. Since then, very few
tariff adjustments have been implemented in the energy sector.

Brazil

In Brazil, ENGIE’s existing power assets and the development of
selected small and medium sized power plants are managed by
Tractebel Energia (TBLE), the country’s largest independent electricity
producer (approximately 6% of Brazil's installed capacity), which is
68.7% owned by ENGIE. The company operates a total installed
capacity of 8,765 MW. TBLE shares are traded on the Brazilian stock
exchange, following the utmost Governance Principles.

Energia Sustentavel do Brasil (ESBR) holds the concession contract to
build, own and operate the 3,750 MW Jirau hydropower project. ESBR
is owned by GSELA (40%), Mitsui (20%) ", Eletrosul (20%) and Chesf
(20%). 30-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) have been signed
with distribution companies for the off-take of 73% of the project's
2,185 MW assured energy production. The remaining assured energy is
contracted to shareholders GSELA, Eletrosul and CHESF. At the end of
Q3,2015, the project had started commercial operation of the 35th unit,
bringing the total installed capacity connected to the national grid to
2,625 MW. With the COD of the 33rd turbine on July 31, Jirau HPP.
achieved 100% of its commercial capacity (2,185 MW average). The
plant's full COD is foreseen in the second half of 2016. Due to vandalism
acts that took place in 2011 and 2012, project implementation was
delayed compared to its original schedule. Jirau is currently discussing a
waiver to its commercial obligations at the justice. A Decision in the First
Instance agreed to grant 535 days of delay to Jirau HPP compared to
the original schedule. Final decision on the merit is yet to be judged. In
line with the prevailing business model, ENGIE’s stake in Jirau will be
transferred to Tractebel Energia when main development risks have
been mitigated.

In addition to Jirau HPP, ENGIE through its subsidiary Tractebel Energia
has a total 765 MW under construction in different projects.

(1) Closing of the sale of 20% stake to Mitsui took place in January 2014.

On the regulatory side, the most important recent measures were the
implementation of the tariff flags scheme in January 2015 and the Law
13,205 was voted on in November 2015 and its adjacent Normative
Resolution 688 was approved in December 2015.

= The implementation of tariff flags scheme imposes a variable cost to
the final consumer electricity tariffs as of January 1, 2015. If the
Brazilian Electricity System faces a critical hydrological condition,
where the dispatch of TPPs with expensive variable cost is required,
the electricity bills will be overcharged according to projected thermal
dispatch, which is thus classified in green flag (no increase at the
base tariff), orange or red.

= The Law 13,205/2015 and Normative Resolution 684 propose a
regulatory framework for the allocation of the hydrological risk
(expressed by the Generation Scaling Factor - GSF within
generators. This framework proposes an assurance system that
generators can adhere to be protected, in different levels, against the
hydrological risk. This measure was the Government's response to
multiple injunctions filed by private hydro generators, questioning the
application of the GSF. Both Tractebel Energia and Energia
Sustentavel do Brasil decided to adhere to the agreement and
consequently to withdraw their participation in the legal injunction
obtained by the Brazilian Association of Independent Power
Producers (APINE).

Despite a relative recovery in the second half of 2015, Brazil underwent
another year of unfavorable hydrology which continued to influence the
sector's performance.

Peru

In Peru, ENGIE owns 61.73% of EnerSur, which has an installed
capacity of 1,902 MW and a market share of around 16% in terms of
energy production. EnerSur shares are traded on the Lima stock
exchange.

Conversion of the 538 MW ChilcaUno thermoelectric power station to a
combined cycle plant with capacity of 805 MW was completed in 2012
and the Cold Reserve thermoelectric plant located in Ilo (south of Peru)
of 564 MW was completed in 2013. Construction of a new 121 MW
HPP at Quitaracsa reached COD in October 2015. EnerSur also won a
bid in December 2013 to build and operate a 500 MW thermal plant in
llo (Nodo Energetico), COD expected in Q4,2016. Additionally, EnerSur
started the construction of an additional unit of CCGT in the site of
Chilca (Chila Plus) where COD is expected for Q4, 2016.

ENGIE also has natural gas transmission activities in Peru, with an 8.1%
stake in TGP (Transportadora de Gas del Pert), which transports natural
gas and associated liquids.

Regulations are based on unbundling of generation, transmission and
distribution activities. These activities have been partially privatized. As a
result, all new investments in generation are undertaken by the private
sector. Around a third of Peru's generation is still controlled by
state-owned company Electropert.

(2) GSF represents the assured energy adjustment factor applied to hydro generators when the overall system generation is below its total assured
energy. Therefore, in a situation of deficit in the system hydropower plants allocated energy are discounted at GSF.

In July 2014, the tender regarding the construction and operation of a
new gas pipeline linking the area of domestic production (Camisea) to
the Southern part of Peru was awarded to the consortium constituted
by Odebrecht and Enagas. This will allow ENGIE to convert Nodo.
Energetico to gas.

Chile

E-CL is the leading company in electricity generation in Northern Chile,
with an installed capacity of 2,081 MW. ENGIE owns 52.76% of E-CL.
E-CL's subsidiary Electroandina operates a port in Tocopilla and its gas
transportation subsidiary Gasoducto NorAndino owns a gas pipeline of
approximately 1,000 km between Chile and Argentina.

ENGIE also holds a 63% stake in the Méjillones LNG regasification
terminal (GNLM). The commercial operation started in June 2010, using
first. a 162,400 m° (gross capacity) floating storage unit. Since
March 2014, it has been replaced by an onshore LNG storage tank, with
anet capacity of 175,000 m*

Since April 2011, Solgas (previously Distrinor - 100% ENGIE) has been
selling natural gas sourced through GNLM to industrial clients and
power plants located in the north of Chile.

In Chile’s Central Electricity Grid, through the wholly owned company
Edlica Monte Redondo, the Group's two main assets are the Monte
Redondo 48 MW wind farm, and 34.4 MW Laja hydropower plant,
which reached COD in May 2015.

To comply with the supply contract with distribution companies
awarded in Dec 2014, E.CL began the construction of a new 375 MW.
power plant and a port in the area of Méjillones, in addition to the
transmission line 2x500kV, 1,500 MW between the cities of Mejillones
and Copiapo, interconnecting the 2 main grids in Chile. The project of
interconnection is currently being developed by TEN, an E.CL wholly
owned company.

By Decree 158, published in April 2015, the facilities of TEN
(Transmisora Eléctrica del Norte) project, were declared as part of
Chile's trunk transmission system, ensuring a regulated income.E.CL.
began the process of finding a strategic partner for 50% ownership of
TEN. In December 2015 E-CL and Red Eléctrica Internacional reached
an agreement in which Red Eléctrica Internacional, through its subsidiary
Red Eléctrica Chile, is acquiring 50% of the share capital of TEN.

Uruguay

In July, ENGIE, through GNLS - contracted by Gas Sayago SA to build
and operate the LNG regasification terminal in Montevideo, Uruguay —
sent a letter to Gas Sayago with regard to the impossibility of continuing
the regasification terminal project in Uruguay. Since then GNLS has.
worked with Gas Sayago so as to ensure a transition of works, assets
and information. On September 30, Termination Agreement for the
termination of the Terminal Use Agreement (TUA) was signed and all
Conditions Precedent (CPs) to effectiveness of the termination of the
TUA were completed on October 6.

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

1.3.2.6.2 Energy North America

Energy North America manages the Group’s electricity and gas activities
in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico. GSENA
operations are organized into five business segments: US power
generation, US retail, US natural gas/LNG, Mexico and Canada. A
central portfolio management group optimizes the interface between
each business segment. The business employs 2,300 people.

Energy North America has an ownership interest in 12,971 MW of
electric power and cogeneration capacity. Of this capacity, close to
1,000 MW are powered by renewable sources.

The US natural gas/LNG business includes a LNG receiving facility and a
gas sales business in New England. In the US, the company also.
markets power to commercial and industrial customers, and to small
business and residential customers, in 11 States plus the District of
Columbia. In Mexico, the company operates natural gas Local
Distribution Companies (LDCs), gas transmission pipelines and power
plants. The business in Canada is composed primarily of utility-scale
wind and solar facilities.

United States

North American operations are headquartered in Houston, Texas, and
the US business employs over 1,500 people. It owns and operates the
Everett terminal just North of Boston, Massachusetts, which has the
capacity to deliver approximately 700 million cubic feet of natural gas
per day to the New England market. Energy North America leases over
10.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas storage. The US activities have
11,379 MW of capacity in operation.

In February 2016, ENGIE announced that it had signed two definitive
agreements for the sale of its interests in 10 GW of merchant power
generation capacity in the US. 8.7 GW of thermal assets will be acquired
by a joint venture formed by Dynegy and ECP. 1.2 GW of pumped
storage hydro assets (First Light) and 0.2 GW of conventional hydro.
assets located in Massachusetts and Connecticut will be acquired by
Public Sector Pension Investment Board, a Canadian pension
investment fund. The transactions are subject to customary closing
conditions and are expected to be close in H2 2016 and H1 2016
respectively.

Energy North America markets to large commercial and industrial
customers under the Group's brand and to small commercial and
residential customers under the Think Energy retail brand. The retail
business serves approximately 60,000 customer meters with an
estimated peak load of nearly 10,000 MW. Retail electricity and natural
gas sales to customers are regulated in the US by each of the
50 States’ public utility commissions.

The Group's energy interests in the US are governed by Federal and
State regulations. Interstate wholesale electricity and natural gas
markets in the US are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). Since 1992, the FERC has issued successive
regulatory orders to remove barriers to competition in wholesale
electricity markets. Over 60% of electricity consumed is delivered
through one of the ten Independent System Operators (ISOs) or
Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) that were created to
facilitate electricity competition.

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

In 2015, the following milestone was achieved:

@ Think Energy is now active in 12 deregulated states in the United
States.

The final version of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean
Power Plan, setting power plants greenhouse gas emissions reductions
targets, entered the Federal Register in August, requiring States to
reduce emissions by 32% from 2008 levels by 2030.

Puerto Rico

The activities in Puerto Rico include a 35% stake in the 507 MW
EcoEléctrica gas-fired plant and in the EcoEléctrica LNG terminal.

Mexico

In Mexico, ENGIE operates six LDCs that serve more than
425,000 customers through a 10,000km gas system and two gas
transmission companies operating over 900 km of pipelines. ENGIE also
manages three steam-electricity cogeneration plants with a_ total
installed capacity of 320 MW. Output from these power plants is sold
under long-term contracts to industrial clients.

In 2015, the following milestones were achieved:

@ ENGIE, together with its partner PEMEX, are building the Ramones
Phase II South pipeline (Ramones Il South), a segment of the
Ramones natural gas pipeline system, which is one of the largest
energy infrastructure projects in Mexico's history, extending from the
Texas border to central Mexico. The project has progressed as
expected and will start operations early 2016;

= the 80 km Mayakan Extension gas pipeline has been completed and
is now fully physically interconnected with the Mexican pipeline
network.

Sweeping Energy Reforms were voted in in 2013. New laws and
regulations were published in 2014/2015. As a result of these reforms
the regulation of the electricity and natural gas markets is under the
remit of the Comision Reguladora de Energia (Energy Regulatory
Commission), which is also charged with encouraging investment and
promoting competition in electricity and natural gas markets. The new
electricity market will begin operations in 2016. ENGIE is developing
options to grow under this new scheme either in electricity or gas
markets, focused on power generation based on efficient cogeneration,
natural gas and renewables, and natural gas distribution and
transportation.

Canada

The Canadian operations include utility-scale wind and solar generation
totaling 801 MW. The renewable portfolio operates within a joint venture
set up in 2012 between Mitsui & Co and a consortium led by Fiera
Axium Infrastructure Inc., each holding a 30% interest. ENGIE, the
largest shareholder with a 40% interest, continues to operate and
maintain these assets. The company also owns and operates the
112 MW West Windsor natural gas-fired power plant in Ontario.

In Canada, energy policy is the jurisdiction of Provincial Governments.
Energy markets across Canada tend towards vertically integrated utilities
and/or various government owned corporations (with the exception of
Alberta). Government-run procurements are a common contracting
method and result in long-term PPAs for generation facilities.

1.3.2.6.3 Energy UK-Turkey

Energy UK-Turkey operates a diverse portfolio of 6,268 MW of
generation assets, including conventional coal, oil and gas-fired plants,
pumped storage and renewables. In addition, it owns a retail business, a
gas distribution business and a trading function.

United Kingdom

Energy UK-Turkey is one of the major electricity generators in the UK
with a merchant generation fleet of operational assets with a total
capacity of 5,025 MW.

Together with Mitsui (25%), ENGIE (75%) operates power plants at
Rugeley (coal), Saltend (gas), Deeside (gas), First Hydro (pumped
storage) and Indian Queens (light fuel oil) as well as the trading business.
The demolition of the 100%-owned Teesside (gas) plant completed in
2015. In February 2016 it was announced that Rugeley power Station is
expected to cease operations in early summer 2016. Energy UK-Turkey
also holds 50% ownerships of seven operational wind farms
(Barlockhart, Blantyre, Carsington, Craigengelt, Crimp, Flimby, Sober) as.
well as a small pipeline of renewable projects at various stages of
development.

The region has a trading business which trades UK power, UK gas, EU
carbon, and coal to manage the commodity price exposures associated
with its generation assets and retail market position. The UK retail
business, based in Leeds, supplies around 16,500 industrial and
commercial sites with electricity and/or gas. In addition to supplying
energy, the retail business offers demand-side services and is a growing
provider of export contracts and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
The region also has a 30% ownership interest in OPUS, an electricity
and gas supplier to over 200,000 UK customers in the SME (small and
medium sized businesses) sector.

The UK market has enjoyed a liberalized electricity market since the
introduction of the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) in
2001. The UK Government has brought forward some major changes
over the last 5 years to help it meet its EU 2020 targets including the
Carbon Price Floor to provide greater certainty going forward, the
Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme to encourage the deployment of
low carbon technology, and the Capacity Mechanism (CM) to ensure
security of supply; the Government also created the Levy Control
framework (LCF) to control costs to the consumer. ENGIE engages with
these instruments when it is appropriate to do so, for example by
participating in the CM auction. The UK electricity market will continue to.
evolve over the coming years as low carbon technologies are
increasingly deployed under these incentives, coal generation is closed,
and gas fired generation is increasingly used to provide essential
support to the system.

Turkey

With a total generating capacity of 1,243 MW, Energy UK-Turkey has a
presence in two generation assets in Turkey through its 95% stake in
the 763 MW Baymina Enerji, a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)
power station, and a 33.3% stake in 480 MW Uni-Mar Marmara, a
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant. Power generated is
sold to TETAS, the national electricity offtaker, under long-term PPAs.
The region also owns 90% of Turkey's third largest natural gas
distributor, IZGAZ, which distributes and markets natural gas to more
than 300,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in the
Kocaeli region. Furthermore, Energy UK-Turkey has also been
developing its power trading and origination activities as well as its retail
business in the country.

In cooperation with its Japanese partners Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
(MHI) and Itochu, ENGIE has launched a feasibility study for a nuclear
power station to be built near the city of Sinop, based on the ATMEA1
technology developed by MHI and Areva (around 4.5 GW). The
intergovernmental agreement between the Turkish and Japanese
governments and the agreement between the project operators and the
Turkish government have been approved by the respective authorities
and were ratified by the Turkish parliament in 2015.

Historically Turkey has been a PPA market with a single buyer. However,
the Turkish power market is currently going through a process of
liberalization with the aim of becoming a fully merchant market.
Merchant market trading has been gradually introduced with daily
settlements on the Balancing and Settlements Market commencing at
the end of 2010.

1.3.2.6.4 Energy South Asia, Middle East & Africa
(SAMEA)

Middle East

In the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Energy SAMEA acts as
an asset developer, owner and operator, selling the electricity and water
it produces directly to government-owned utilities under long-term
P(W)PAs (Power (and Water) Purchase Agreements). It is the leading
private power and water developer in the region with total generation
capacity of 28.6 GW and 1,212 MIGD (5.5 million m’) water/day of
desalination capacity in operation and under construction. It is common
in the Middle East IP(W)P (Independent Power (and Water) Producer)
business model for projects to be part owned by the host
governments/offtakers alongside partners. The region conducts the
operations of all of the plants that it owns, often through an arms-length
Operations & Maintenance (O&M) contract.

The regulatory frameworks in the different countries of the GCC are
similar, with competitive tenders launched by the power authorities
calling for private power producers to bid for concessions to build, own
and operate plants. The output is then sold by the private producer to a
public utility under long-term contracts, the terms of which are stipulated
at the tender stage.

Energy SAMEA has ownership interests in the following natural gas-fired
power and water producing plants in the GCC:

= Saudia Arabia: Marafiq, Riyadh PP11, Tihama;
= Bahrain: Al Dur, Al Ezzel, Al Hidd;

= Oman: Al Kamil, Al Rusail, Barka 2, Barka 3, Sohar 1, Sohar 2;
= Kuwait: Az Zour North.

The SAMEA region currently has 2,660 MW power capacity and 159
MIGD (723,000 m*/day) water capacity under construction in the GCC,
in Saudi Arabia (extension of Tihama), Kuwait (Az Zour North IWPP) and
the UAE (Mirfa IWPP).

One and a half years after the start of the Az Zour North 1 Independent
Water and Power Project in Kuwait, the project achieved Early
Commercial Operation Date (ECOD) of its three units. The plant is now
delivering circa 660MW to the State of Kuwait until March 2016, when
the three operating units will be handed back to the EPC contractor for
the conversion to combined cycle capacity. Az Zour North 1, a gas-fired
CCGT of 1,500 MW with an associated water desalination plant of
486,000 m*%day, is Kuwait's first independent water and power
producer. The project is owned 40% by a consortium with ENGIE
(17.5%) and 60% by the Kuwaiti government.

In Oman, OPWP (Oman Power & Water Procurement Company)
confirmed that the Power Purchase Agreement for Al Kamil, a 277 MW.
Independent Power Producer (65% owned by ENGIE), will be extended
to 2020. The 15-year-long PPA of Al Kamil with OPWP would normally
expire in April 2017.

South Asia

In Pakistan, in the south-western province of Baluchistan, Energy
SAMEA holds 100% in Uch |, a 551 MW gas-fired facility. The 381 MW.
gas-fired unit Uch Il (100% ownership), an extension to Uch |, started
commercial operation in April 2014. The electricity generated from Uch II
is sold through a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement with the National
Transmission and Despatch Company, a state-owned utility.

All power generated by IPPs in Pakistan is sold under long-term PPAs to
distribution companies. The end consumer market is not liberalized.
Around 50% of generation capacity is held by private IPPs, while the
remainder is held by state-owned entities.

In India, ENGIE has a 89% equity share in the Meenakshi thermal project
in Andhra Pradesh, which comprises 269 MW of operational capacity
and 638 MW under construction. In February 2016, ENGIE announced
an agreement to sell its entire shareholding in Meenakshi to India Power
Corporation Limited. The deal is expected to close in H1 2016 subject
to customary approvals and regulatory consents.

The power sector in India is liberalized, with various offtake
arrangements (long-term PPAs, short-term bilateral contracts and spot
trading) all possible.

Also in Andhra Pradesh, ENGIE signed binding Joint Venture
Agreements with Andhra Pradesh Gas Distribution Corporation
(APGDC), GAIL and Shell for the development of a Floating Storage and
Regasification Unit (FRSU) in Kakinada. The two JVAs respectively cover
the creation of a Terminal Company and of an LNG Supply & Gas
Marketing Company. ENGIE’s share in each will be 26%.

ENGIE also has a strategic partnership with Petronet LNG Ltd.

Africa

In Africa, ENGIE has 2.8 GW thermal and renewable power capacity in
operation and under construction.

In South Africa, the 94 MW West Coast 1 Wind Farm, in which ENGIE
holds a 43% equity stake, started commercial operation in June. The
project is part of South Africa's successful Renewable Energy
Independent Power Producer Procurement (REIPPP) programme. In
September, Dedisa Peaking Power (38% owned by ENGIE) started
commercial operation, adding 335MW power to the national
transmission system in the Eastern Cape Province. Together with the
670 MW Avon Peaking Power Project near Durban (KwaZulu-Natal) that
is still under construction, Dedisa is South Africa's first large scale
independent power project originated by the Department of Energy. The
power generated by these two open cycle gas turbine power plants will
be sold to Eskom Holdings, South Africa's state-owned utility, under a
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) over a 15-year term.

Also in South Africa, Kathu Solar Park, a consortium led by ENGIE (49%)
with South African investors was awarded preferred bidder by the
Department of Energy. Kathu is a 100 MW greenfield Concentrated
Solar Power (CSP) project with parabolic trough technology and
equipped with a molten salt storage system that allows 4.5 hours of
thermal energy storage. It is situated in the Northern Cape Province, 600
km south-west of the capital Pretoria.

In Morocco the Safi 2x693 MW project is under construction. Following
completion of the plant, expected in 2018, the electricity produced will
be sold to the Office National de I’Electricité et de I'Eau Potable (ONEE)
under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement.

In Egypt, ENGIE received the Letters of Eligibility and signed the Land
MoUs for the development of a 50 MW solar PV project (Binban, Aswan)
and two 50 MW wind projects (Gulf of Suez). ENGIE was also awarded
top-ranked bidder status for the 250 MW Gulf of Suez wind project.

In terms of regulation, a single buyer model, whereby output is sold by
the private producer to a public utility under long-term contracts, has
been adopted in Morocco and South Africa.

1.3.2.6.5 Energy Asia-Pacific

Energy Asia-Pacific has strongholds in Australia, Indonesia, Singapore
and Thailand. Its businesses in Asia-Pacific include the construction and
operation of power plants, natural gas distribution systems and retail
activities.

Australia

The Australian business is focused on a diverse portfolio of generation
assets operating in the National Electricity Market (NEM) that serves
90% of the Australian population and demand, resident in the eastern
states. The portfolio also includes a co-generation asset that is located
in the separate South Western Integrated System (SWIS) market that
serves Western Australia. It also has a retail business called “Simply
Energy” in the NEM, serving electricity and gas accounts in the

domestic, small to medium enterprise and large commercial and
industrial customer segments.

The Australian Energy business is an important participant in the NEM. It
predominantly produces wholesale electricity and is focused on delivery
of value through optimal participation of its assets in the relevant
Australian electricity, gas and renewable energy markets, exploration of
potential synergies with other ENGIE businesses in Australia, and
opportunistic growth of its generation and retail portfolios, including
renewables. In 2013, Mitsui acquired a 28% stake in all the Australian
Energy assets (except Loy Yang B and Kwinana - where Mitsui already
owned 30%). The portfolio in Australia:

= generating assets in South Australia: 893 MW;
= generating assets in Victoria: 2,507 MW;

= generating assets in Western Australia: 123 MW;
= retail customers Simply Energy: over 552,000.

Australian energy markets have been progressively liberalized since the
mid-1990s, when the first wholesale electricity market was introduced in
Victoria. The level of private and state-owned energy infrastructure varies
between states. Under the Competition Principles Agreement, between
state and federal governments, publicly owned businesses _ in
competitive markets are treated in a manner intended to ensure
competitive neutrality between public and private energy businesses.
Queensland is the only state in the NEM that is yet to privatize their
generation assets and New South Wales is in the process of privatizing
their wholly Government owned network business

The NEM is a deregulated merchant wholesale market serving the
interconnected eastern states of Australia, in operation since 1998. It is
a near real-time, energy-only, gross pool, spot market with no capacity
payments. Up to 48 GW of installed generation capacity is dispatched
on a five-minute basis over five states.

Gas markets exist in each of the eastern states except Tasmania, and
are less developed than the electricity market. With the commencement
of significant export LNG projects in 2015/16 it is expected that
domestic gas prices will be linked to export LNG prices. The Wholesale
Electricity Market (WEM) for the SWIS commenced operation in
September 2006. The WEM operates in the south-west region of
Western Australia, the location of most of that state’s population
(estimated at just over 2 million). The SWIS has a summer peak demand
of approximately 4,000 MW. The WEM market structure is a net bilateral
structure and has separate capacity and energy mechanisms.

The (former) Australian Government's “Clean Energy Future” greenhouse
gas emissions reduction scheme commenced in July 2012, committing
it to a medium-term national target of reducing emissions significantly. In
September 2013, a new government was elected and in July 2014 they
repealed the Carbon Legislation. An emission reduction fund was
established on July 1, 2014, to replace the Carbon scheme and is now
funding projects that deliver CO. reductions through a reverse auction
process. In addition there is a Renewable Energy target scheme in place
that encourages renewable energy projects.

Indonesia

ENGIE holds a 40.5% stake in Paiton 3 & 7/8, with a total of 2,085 MW
coal-fired capacity, located on the island of Java. A PPA is in place for
both Paiton 7/8 and Paiton3 up to 2042. In February 2016, ENGIE
announced an agreement to sell its 40.5% stake in Paiton to Nebras
Power Q.S.C and a combination of some of the existing Paiton
shareholders. The deal is expected to close in H2 2016, subject to
customary approvals and regulatory consents.

In cooperation with PT Supreme Energy, the business is also developing
three geothermal projects in Sumatra (Muara Laboh, Rantau Dedap and
Rajabasa).

State owned incumbent PLN has the monopoly on transmission and
distribution systems. Since the mid-1990s IPPs have been allowed to
operate in Indonesia and they now operate 16% of the existing
generating capacity. The end-user market is not liberalized.

In December 2009, the “Crash 2 program” for 10,000 MW of new
generation capacity was launched. This program stipulated that 50% of
this new capacity is to come from IPPs and 50% from PLN, and that
5,340 MW of the new capacity will come from renewable resources. In
2014, the new Jokowi administration has set a target to develop
35,000 MW of new generating capacity by 2019 out of which
10,000 MW will be developed by PLN and 25,000 MW will be built by
IPPs.

Thailand & Laos

The Glow Group, in which ENGIE holds a majority interest (69.1%), is
listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. It is a major participant in the
Thai energy market with a combined installed capacity in Thailand and
Laos of 3,216 MW. The Glow Group generates and supplies electricity
to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) under
Thailand's SPP (Small Power Producer) and IPP (Independent Power
Producer) programs, in addition to supplying electricity, steam, industrial
water and services to large industrial customers principally located in the
Map Ta Phut industrial Estate, Rayong Province.

Presentation of the Group
1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

ENGIE also owns a 40% stake in PTT NGD, a distributor of natural gas
to industrial customers in the Bangkok region.

State-owned EGAT is the main entity in the electricity sector. Until
liberalization of the sector, EGAT generated around 95% of Thailand's
power. It now accounts for about 50% of generation capacity while the
rest is accounted for by the non-government sector comprising IPPs,
SPPs and imports from Laos and Malaysia. IPPs in Thailand sell the
energy that they produce to EGAT under long-term contracts, the terms
of which are stipulated at the IPP tender stage. In industrial parks private
generation companies can sell electricity to local customers.

Singapore

ENGIE holds a 30% stake in Senoko Energy, the largest
vertically-integrated energy company by generation capacity in
Singapore. Senoko Energy owns and operates a unique portfolio of
power generation assets with a combined capacity of 3,200 MW and
with a market share of more than 25%. Its retail arm currently has about
20% share of the contestable market.

In 2001, the electricity generation and retail markets were separated
from the natural monopoly existing in the electricity transmission market
The National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) was established in
2003: generation companies compete to sell electricity every
30 minutes, while electricity retailers buy electricity from the NEMS and
offer packages to sell electricity to eligible consumers. In 2004, in order
to promote efficiency and competition in the electricity market, vesting
contracts were introduced whereby generation companies are
committed to sell a specified amount of electricity at a specified price.

Senoko continues to renew its generation portfolio. Its latest plant are
the 2x431 MW MHI repowered CCP known as CCP6&7, which both
went into commercial operation in 2012. In the retail market, the
threshold for retail contestability has been lowered gradually since 2001

Today, commercial and industry customers using more than 2,000 kWh
of electricity per month on average are eligible for contestability.

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

1.3.3.6 Description of activities

1.3.3.6.1 ENGIE E&P

Role

Development of ENGIE’s natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons
production is a key activity in the Group's integration throughout the gas
value chain. It supports the Group's international growth, particularly in
high-growth regions, and gives access to a portfolio of diversified,
balanced and profitable reserves.

Principal key indicators

Europe and North Africa are the core areas of the Group's exploration
and production business. However, the Group has been stepping up its
international expansion by supporting its other entities, particularly in
Brazil.

As of December 31, 2015, the Group published the following results:
= operations in 13 countries;

= 343 exploration and/or production licences held (of which 56% are
operated by the Group);

= proven and probable (2P) reserves of 699.2 million barrels of oil
equivalent (Mboe), of which 76% is natural gas and 24% liquid
hydrocarbons;

= production of 59.1 Mboe, of which 62% is natural gas and 38% liquid
hydrocarbons.

Activities of ENGIE E&P

Legal framework of the Exploration & Production activities

The Group conducts its exploration and production activities through its
subsidiary ENGIE E&P International SA, in which it holds a 70% stake
(with the remaining 30% held indirectly by the China Investment
Corporation), and the company's affiliates (wholly owned), which
together constitute the ENGIE E&P Business Unit, within the framework
of licences, concessions or production-sharing contracts drawn up with
the public authorities or national companies of the countries involved
Under current partnership contracts, one of the parties is generally
designated as operator, meaning that it is responsible for conducting
daily operations, with the other parties’ approval required for important
matters such as the adoption of a development plan, major investments,
and budgets. Only companies approved by local public authorities can
be selected as operators.

Proven and probable (2P) reserves

In 2015, 16 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled, nine of which
were successful. Part of the resources thus proven will contribute to
reserves in the future.

The tables below show all of the Group’s proven and probable (2P)
reserves (including developed and undeveloped reserves") and their
geographical distribution.

(1) Developed reserves are those that can be produced from existing facilities. Undeveloped reserves are those needing new wells, new facilities or
significant adaitional investments, starting from existing facilities, such as a compression unit.

(1) “Other” covers Algeria, Ivory Coast, Egypt and Indonesia.

As of December 31, 2015, ENGIE E&P’s 2P reserves of liquid
hydrocarbons and natural gas (“entitlement” ° were 699.2 Mboe,
compared with 758.8 Mboe in 2014. Gas accounts for 76% of these
reserves, which represent a volume of 532 Mboe, or 85 billion cubic
meters.

For those fields that are operated under a production-sharing contract,
the “tax barrels” reserves have been recognized in accordance with the
Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) rules for recognizing 2P reserves.
These “tax barrels” reserves correspond to the taxes paid on behalf of
ENGIE E&P by its partners, the national oil companies, to the authorities
of the respective countries.

The Group's share in 2P reserves for the fields in which it is a partner
(working interest reserves) was 864Mboe at the end of 2015,
compared with 922 Mboe at the end of 2014.

Each year, a proportion of approximately one-third of the reserves is
evaluated independently by a specialist consulting firm (DeGolyer and
MacNaughton this year)

To estimate its 2P reserves, the Group uses the “SPE PRMS"
classification, based on the common definitions of the SPE and the
World Petroleum Congress (WPC).

The 2P reserves replacement ratio for a given period is defined as the
ratio of additions of 2P reserves for the period (discoveries, net
acquisitions and revisions of reserves) to production for the period. The
2P reserves replacement ratio for ENGIE E&P was 90% over the
2011-2013 period, 82% over the 2012-2014 period, and 18% over the
2013-2015 period.

(1) As amounts are rounded by the database, there may be insignificant variances between line-items and totals.

(2) Unless otherwise specified, the references made to 2P reserves and production must be understood as ENGIE E&P’s stake in these reserves and
production (net of all licence charges taken in kind by third parties in the form of crude oil or natural gas (entitlement). These references include the
total of these net 2P oil, gas, and other hydrocarbon reserves estimated as being extractable for the remaining duration of the licences, concessions,
and production-sharing agreements. ENGIE holds an equity interest of 70% in ENGIE E&P International, which it consolidates by the full consolidation

method.

(3) Under a production-sharing agreement, part of the hydrocarbons produced is returned alrectly in kind to the government. These volumes are not
recognized as 2P reserves and are therefore less than the reserves calculated on the basis of the percentage interests held (working interest reserves).

Description of the LNG activities in the Group

ENGIE's recognized expertise over the entire LNG value chain, from
production to imports and marketing, including LNG terminal operation
and maritime shipping, enables it to meet the needs of the industry.

LNG gives the Group access to new natural gas resources and helps it
diversify and secure its supply. It also enables the Group to develop new
markets and to rationalize management of its gas supply portfolio. The
LNG business is being developed in coordination with the Group's
upstream activities (exploration & production) and downstream activities
(natural gas supply and power production).

LNG supply and positions in liquefaction

ENGIE buys LNG under long-term (15-20 years) and medium-term
(2-5 years) supply contracts. The Group also purchases spot LNG
cargoes. The Group's contractual annual long-term commitments are as.

LNG destination and positions in regasification terminals

In 2015, LNG deliveries were made mainly in Europe and Asia, as well
as in North and South America.

The Group has access to regasification capacity in six countries: France,
the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States, Chile and Puerto Rico.

In India in April 2012, ENGIE was selected as a strategic partner of the
Andhra Pradesh Gas Distribution Corporation (APGDC) for the
development of a floating import LNG terminal. With a capacity of
3.5 Mtpa, the terminal will be located at Kakinada on the east coast of
India. ENGIE would have a stake in the terminal with access to
regasification capacity. Shell joined this project in July 2014.

ENGIE LNG is also positioned in the Asian LNG markets undergoing
high growth, with the signing of several sale contracts, including:

Long-term gas contracts:

= a contract for the sale of 0.8 million tons per annum of LNG to the
Taiwanese company CPC from 2018 for a period of 20 years,
provided by the Cameron LNG liquefaction plant;

= a contract for the sale of 0.3 million tons per annum of LNG to the
Japanese company Tohoku Electric Power from 2018 for a period of
20 years, provided by the Cameron LNG liquefaction plant.

Maritime transport

ENGIE uses a fleet of LNG vessels that it adapts in size to meet its
long-term commitments and its one-time opportunities. The chartering
terms vary from a few days to 20 years or more. At the end of 2015, the
ENGIE fleet included 14 LNG carriers:

= 3 ships owned by the Group: Matthew (126,540 m‘), Provalys
(154,500 m*), GDF SUEZ Global Energy (74,130 m*);

= 2ships of which the Group is a co-owner: Gaselys (154,500 m°,
owned by the NYK Group and ENGIE) and BW GDF SUEZ Boston
(owned by the BW Gas Group and ENGIE); and

= Qother ships chartered from other shipping companies.

In maritime transport, ENGIE also has an 80% stake in shipping
management company GAZOCEAN (the other 20% stake is held by
Japanese shipping company NYK), and a 40% stake in Gaztransport &
Technigaz (GTT).

1.3.3.6.3. GTT (Gaztransport & Technigaz)

Role

GTT is the world leader in the design of cryogenic membrane
containment systems used in the shipping industry for LNG
transportation. GTT has more than 50 years of experience in its field.

GTT operates in 5 sectors: LNG carriers, FLNG (floating production,
storage and unloading units for LNG), FSRU (floating storage and
regasification units for LNG), land storage tanks and solutions for LNG
use as fuel.

GTT aims to:
= provide the LNG industry with containment systems designed by the

Company that enable the safe and reliable bulk transportation and
storage of LNG;

= provide engineering, consultancy, training, maintenance assistance
and execution of technical studies at every stage of the LNG chain;
and

= adapt its technologies to promote new outlets for LNG, including by
helping to develop LNG as a shipping fuel, and the transportation of
LNG by sea or river in small or mid-sized vessels.

Principal key indicators
As at December 31, 2015:

the order backlog contained more than 118 orders (LNG tankers,
ethane tankers, FLNG "”, FSRU ”, and land storage tanks);

= GIT is the leader in its sector, representing more than 83% of global
orders for LNG tankers, FSRU and FLNG, and the only three FLNG
orders over 50,000 m®, between 2010 and December 31, 2015;

= GTT employs around 380 staff, two-thirds of whom are engineers.

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

Activities

GTT has developed tried and tested technologies over the past
50 years. It is the only company that markets “membrane” containment
technologies for ships with general approval for application on vessels.
Applied to LNG tankers, these technologies allow for LNG to be
transported in bulk in the ship, as the hull is protected by thermal
insulation that maintains the LNG at cryogenic temperature (-162°C at
atmospheric pressure). As the LNG is contained by a thin metal lining,
this double membrane complies with regulatory requirements.

GTT's two main technologies whose implementation is comprehensively
controlled, Mark IIl and NO 96, are well-known for their excellence and
reliability. They are protected by patents. These technologies, and
developments in them, are mainly used on tankers for LNG
transportation. Meanwhile, thanks to long-term investments in research
and development relating to its traditional technologies, GTT has
developed new applications, particularly for floating units (FSRU and
FLNG), and land storage tanks.

1.3.4 Infrastructures business line

1.3.4.1 Role

The Infrastructures business line combines in a coherent body the
Group's gas infrastructures in France, through four specialized
subsidiaries in transmission, storage, LNG terminals and distribution
activities. To achieve overall optimization, a number of foreign
infrastructure management subsidiaries (in Germany and the UK) also
report to it.

The combined positions of these subsidiaries and stakes make the
ENGIE Group the leading European player in the gas infrastructures
sector.

Its business model guarantees it stable, recurring revenues and cash
flow that contribute effectively to the financial stability of the ENGIE
Group.

GTT's customers can access its technologies by implementing licensing
agreements that provide them with protected rights to the technologies
as well as the know-how of GTT, which supports its customers
throughout their construction projects.

GTT also provides its customers with engineering services irrespective of
whether they enter into a licensing agreement.

Lastly, GTT provides ad hoc services that include training, maintenance
assistance, certification assistance and execution of technical studies.

GTT's technologies have long been accepted and endorsed by the
classification companies in the maritime domain.

The Company, which has been  |SO-9001-certified since
December 2010, is now focused on fine-tuning its quality management
system so that it can continue consistently to meet the quality standards
required by its customers.

Nearly all of the Company's customers are in Asia (mainly China and
South Korea).

1.3.4.2 Strategy

The Infrastructures business line and its subsidiaries aim to promote the
development of their long-term activities by strengthening the position of
natural gas in the French energy mix, and by seeking new sources of
growth in France and internationally.

Their strategic reflections also aim to adapt the offer from subsidiaries in
the short-term, given the situation marked by restrictions, uncertainty
and opportunities.

Finally, they seek to combine day-to-day professional excellence (safety
of property and persons and continuity of customer supply) and
economic efficiency.

1.3.4.3. Organization

The organization of activities within the Infrastructures business line is
based on four independent subsidiaries which are all incorporated as
French sociétés anonymes. In France, each of them operates, markets
and develops facilities directly under their own responsibility: Storengy
for its storage sites, Elengy for its LNG terminals at Montoir-de-Bretagne
and Fos Tonkin, GRDF for its distribution network, and GRTgaz for its
transmission network (pipelines and in-line compression stations).

In addition, three of them carry the Group's investment stakes in

ENGIE or its subsidiaries are strictly regulated (cf. Articles L. 111-17 and
L. 111-18 of the Energy Code). Some are subject to prior authorization
from the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE). In particular, service
provision contracts by the “vertically integrated company” to GRTgaz (cf.

A specific legislative and regulatory environment

ENGIE remains a vertically integrated group but its organization
concerning gas infrastructure management activities has been strongly
impacted by the implementation of successive European Directives
regarding the organization of the domestic energy market and the laws
transposing them. The infrastructure activities have all been affiliated.

In 2011, in its transposition of the “internal market in natural gas”
Directive 2009/73/EC, known as the “Third Gas Directive”, France opted
for the ITO" system for the transmission network manager (GRTgaz).
This system sets out the autonomy and independence rules with which
GRTgaz must comply in respect of ENGIE while recognizing the
entitlement of ENGIE to perform economic and management
supervision. In 2012, the CRE certified the compliance of GRTgaz with
these provisions.

After a thorough analysis of French legislation (especially the Energy
Code) transposing the Third Gas Directive, the European Commission
made some comments on its compliance with the Directive. France’s
Energy Transition for Green Growth Act of August 17, 2015, authorized
the government to take measures to complete this transposition.

The legal framework within which the activities of the Infrastructures
business line are carried out includes the General Local Authorities Code
which specifies the scheme applying specifically to concession-based
distribution networks, the Energy Code which reviewed and updated a
substantial part of the other legislative provisions relating to natural gas,
and the Environment Code which specifically determines the rules on
the construction and operation of transmission infrastructures.

Presentation of the Group
1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

The Energy Code imposes public service obligations on ENGIE and its
subsidiaries, especially natural gas infrastructure managers. It provides
for the French state to sign public service contracts with ENGIE,
GRTgaz and GRDF to ensure the implementation of public service tasks.
These contracts were signed in the fourth quarter of 2015. They cover
the period 2015-2018. The French State publishes an_ indicative
multiyear plan describing foreseeable changes in demand for natural
gas, how this demand is met and investments scheduled to this end.

The CRE ensures the proper functioning of the market to the benefit of
consumers and ensures compliance by infrastructure managers with
their obligations: access to infrastructures, non-discrimination, and
respect for the confidential nature of commercially sensitive information
(CSI). Managers of the transmission and distribution networks must draft
a Code of Conduct approved by the CRE. An independent compliance
manager, reporting to the CRE, monitors its implementation.

The CRE sets the regulatory framework (rate of return for assets, tariff
indexation mechanism, measures to encourage certain types of
investment, etc.) and the corresponding infrastructure access tariffs.

1.3.4.6.1 Underground natural gas storage

The Group is the leader in underground storage in Europe, with a
storage capacity of around 12.5 Gm*,

France
As of December 31, 2015, Storengy was operating in France:

= 14 underground storage facilities (including 13 wholly-owned). Nine of
these storage facilities are in aquifers (total useful storage volume of
9 billion m’), four are in salt caverns (total useful storage volume of
1 billion m’), and one is in a depleted field (useful storage volume of
80 million m’); three of these sites have been mothballed
(corresponding to a total useful volume of 800 million m*);

= 51 compressors with a total power of 219 MW, needed to withdraw
and inject natural gas;

= surface facilities required to process the gas withdrawn, before
injection into the transmission network.

Legislative and regulatory environment in France

Underground storage facilities fall under the Mining Code and are
operated pursuant to a concession granted by the French State
following a public inquiry and competitive tenders. ENGIE holds mining
rights that it farms out" to its subsidiary Storengy, which operates them
and thus holds the corresponding authorizations.

According to the Third Gas Directive, access to storage is organized
according to a system known as “negotiated system”. Storage prices
are set by Storengy in a transparent, non-discriminatory manner. The
Energy Code and the decree of August 21, 2006 set the access
conditions for storage facilities. This decree specifically sets out the
conditions for granting and assigning storage capacity access rights and
their distribution, and requires the authorized supplier or agent to
maintain sufficient stores in order that, on October 31 of every year, they

have enough natural gas to supply their customers from November 1 to
March 31. An annual decree sets out the storage rights in question and
related obligations. Pricing conditions vary according to the technical
capacity of the reservoirs, the basic storage service and the type of
additional operating services selected.

This system is expected to change very soon. Having consulted with
stakeholders in April 2015, French public authorities are now seeking to
regulate storage. An auction system would be set up to sell storage
capacity under market conditions. In addition, a financial compensation
mechanism would be established whereby storage operators could
receive revenues as authorized by the regulator.

Germany

Storengy Deutschland GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Storengy, is
one of the leaders on the German underground gas storage market,
with over 8% market share by volume. The company owns and
operates six storage sites for a working capacity of nearly 1.7 billion m®
(three salt sites: Harsefeld, Lesum and Peckensen; and three depleted
sites: Fronhofen, Schmidhausen and Uelsen). It also holds a 19.7%
stake in the depleted site at Breitbrunn (992 million m° in total).

United Kingdom

Storengy UK Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Storengy, is dedicated
to the construction and marketing of storage capacity in saline cavities
at Stublach, in Cheshire. The planned storage capacity at the site is
400 million m? of useful volume, divided into 20 cavities. The UK’s Office
of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) granted it a third-party access
exemption for the entire project.

Storage strategy

Storengy must adapt to an environment characterized not only by
long-term adverse market conditions but also by the ongoing move
towards an “energy transition”. This means:

= optimizing and enhancing its business in its traditional markets;

= facilitating the momentum of natural gas as an energy solution, for
example by contributing to new energy storage solutions (hydrogen,
heat and biomethane storage);

= leveraging its core competencies (drilling, geoscience, risk
management, etc.) on a global level and developing new activities
such as geothermal energy.

1.3.4.6.2_ LNG terminal activities

LNG terminals are port facilities that allow liquid natural gas (LNG) to be
received and regasified. New services have been added since 2012:
reloading and transshipment of LNG tankers and LNG truck loading
(road transported LNG).

Elengy is the second-largest European LNG terminal operator (source:
GIIGNL), with three LNG terminals in France. The facilities operated by
Elengy have a total regasification capacity! of 21.25 billion m® (Gm‘) of
gas per annum at December 31, 2015.

(1) Farming out: in mining law, the name given to an agreement by which the holder of the operating rights (Government or concessionaire) leases the

Fos Tonkin Terminal

Brought into service in 1972, Fos Tonkin is located on the
Mediterranean coast and receives LNG primarily from Algeria. Its
regasification capacity stands at 3 billion m® per year. Its jetty can
accommodate ships carrying up to 75,000 m° of LNG and its tank has a
total capacity of 150,000 m’.

Montoir-de-Bretagne Terminal

Montoir-de-Bretagne, which was brought into service in 1980, is located
on the Atlantic coast and receives LNG from various sources. It has a
regasification capacity of 10 billion m® per year, two jetties that can
accommodate ships transporting up to around 260,000 m* of LNG
(Q-Max) and three tanks with a total capacity of 360,000 m*. Renovation
of the terminal was completed in 2013, allowing it to be operated at its
current capacity until 2035.

Fos Cavaou Terminal

The Fos Cavaou terminal was brought into commercial service in 2010.
It has a regasification capacity of 8.25 billion m® per year, a jetty that can
accommodate Q-Max-size tankers, and three tanks with a total capacity
of 330,000 m*. The terminal is owned by a dedicated subsidiary,
Fosmax LNG, in which Elengy has a 72.5% stake, while Total Gaz
Electricité Holding France SAS holds a 27.5% stake. It is operated by
Elengy.

Legal and regulatory environment specific to
regasification activities in France

An LNG terminal is subject to classification for environmental protection
purposes (so-called “Seveso” facilities) and, as such, its operation is
subject to specific authorization by the prefecture. (These authorizations
were obtained in 2008 for Montoir-de-Bretagne and Fos Tonkin, and in
2012 for Fos Cavaou).

Access to LNG terminals: principles and tariffs

Regulated tariffs for access to LNG terminals applicable since April 1,
2013 were adopted following the CRE ruling of December 13, 2012 and
adjusted mid-period by the CRE ruling of December 17, 2014. They are
scheduled to apply until March 31, 2017.

The tariff package consists of five terms depending on (i) the number of
unload operations, (ii) quantities unloaded, (iii) use of regasification
capacity, (iv) gas-in-kind and (v) seasonal adjustment. The RAB for
Elengy and Fosmax LNG combined stood at €1,098 million at
January 1, 2016 with an actual rate of return of 8.5%, before corporate
income tax.

The LNG terminal activities strategy
Elengy’s strategy is centered on the following key points:

= to optimize operation methods for each of the three sites in order to
get best value from them regardless of their utilization rate;

= to create and implement new services at the terminals, similarly to
what is being done in terms of reloading, transshipment between
LNG tankers and the loading of tanker trucks;

= to search for growth opportunities internationally by highlighting the
asset management and operations expertise developed over the past
50 years.

1.3.4.6.3 Distribution activities in France

GRDF develops, operates and maintains the distribution network,
delivers gas for suppliers and consumers, and connects biomethane
producers to the network. With regard to its distribution activities, it
operates within the general framework set out in Section 1.3.4.1 but has
specific features related to its classification as a local utility.

Legislative and regulatory environment specific to these
activities

The Concession system

Each municipality where a gas supply is available grants a concession to
an authorized distributor to operate the public service of gas distribution
on its territory. Concessions are entered into or renewed based on
standard specifications established jointly by the French national
federation of concession-granting and state-controlled municipalities
(‘Fédération Nationale des Collectivités Concédantes et Régies” or
“FNCCR") and GRDF. Concession-granting bodies exercise control to
ensure the proper execution of the obligations resulting from these
specifications.

Distribution structures belong to the municipalities even when they are
built and financed by the distributor, who has an exclusive right to use
them.

The Energy Code recognizes the entitlement of exclusive concession
rights to historic concession-holders, i.e. GRDF and 22 local distribution
companies (LDC), to exclusive service areas. As holders of a
“distribution monopoly”, they are the sole operators with whom
municipalities may renew the concession. The grounds for terminating a
concession contract early are strictly controlled (listed exhaustively) as is
the date the concession can be terminated (cannot be in the first half of
the contracted term). Termination also requires two years’ notice and
the concession-granting authority must pay compensation to the
concessionaire for early termination.

Apart from the exclusive service areas of GRDF and the LDC, the
Energy Code allows all municipalities not supplied with natural gas to
entrust their public gas distribution to the operator of their choice.

The joint service specific to GRDF and ERDF

The Energy Code assigns a joint service, primarily responsible for
construction, worksite project management, network operations and
maintenance, and metering operations.

GRDF and ERDF are linked by an agreement defining their relationship
within the joint service, the services it provides, and the distribution of
the resulting costs. This agreement, signed for an indefinite period, may
be terminated at any time, subject to 18 months’ notice, during which
period the parties undertake to renegotiate this agreement.

GRDF activities

At December 31, 2015, the French natural gas distribution network
operated by GRDF was the leading network of this type in Europe due
to its length (197,928 km) ". It has some 10.9 million delivery points ® in
the 9,528 municipalities served (8,947 of them based on exclusive rights
assigned to GRDF), representing approximately 77% of the French
population.

With 276 TWh of natural gas delivered in 2015, GRDF represented 95%
of the French market for network gas distribution.

(2) As of December 31, 2015, 2,383,991 customers supplied in this way used an alternative gas supplier.

1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

The average residual term of its concession contracts, weighted by
volumes distributed, was 12.91 years at December 31, 2015.

The joint service's agents took more than 21.9 million gas meter
readings in 2015 and made some 2.3 million technical interventions
related to gas on customers’ premises.

Access to the gas distribution network: principles and
tariffs

The GRDF gas distribution tariff (the “ATRD 4") came into force on
July 1, 2012" for a period of four years. It applies to the GRDF
exclusive service area. The structure of this tariff is consistent with the
previous tariff (compensation on asset base and consideration of
operating expenses). A Charges and Revenue Regularization Account
(CRRA) offsets the difference between some projected and actual
income and expenses, specifically for the income relating to the volume
of gas transported.

The regulated asset base (RAB) includes all distribution activity assets
such as pipelines and connections, pressure regulation stations, meters
and other technical and IT-related equipment, depreciated on a
straight-line basis to determine the annual capital expenses. Pipelines
and connections, which represent 92% of the assets in the RAB are
depreciated over 45 years. The RAB stood at €14,226 million, subject to
CRE validation, at January 1, 2015 with an actual rate of return of 6%,
before corporate income tax.

The tariff structure changed on July1 each year according to a
percentage variation equal to “inflation + 0.2%” (excluding the effect of
the CRRA), based on productivity of 1.3% per annum on net operating
expenses. On July 1, 2015, the tariff increased by 3.93%, including the
effect of the CRRA and covering the costs of the GRDF advanced
metering infrastructure between mid-2013 and late 2015. In addition,
periodic updates to the catalogue and the price of services (suppliers,
customers and biomethane producers) are now subject to rulings by the
CRE.

Following the CRE's discussions on March 10, 2016 to decide on the
standard tariff for the use of GRDF's public networks for natural gas
distribution, a new tariff (known as "ATRD 5") will take effect on July 1,
2016 for a period of four years. The tariffs application, calculation
method and key principles (incentivizing regulations, CRRA) are similar
to those of the previous tariff (ATRD4, applied from July 1, 2012 to June
30, 2016).

The RAB includes all distribution activity assets. The rate of return
applied to the RAB is 5% (real, pre-tax). The 100 basis point cut from
the rate used by the CRE for the previous tariff is mainly due to the
decline in interest rates from the levels that prevailed during the previous
tariff period. The tariff covers operating costs and introduces a
cost-control incentive for operators. A CRRA offsets the difference
between projected and actual income and expenses, specifically for the
income related to the quantities of gas transported (to cover the climate
change impact).

(1) ORE ruling of February 28, 2012.
(2) Source; internal benchmark from public data for 2010.

The tariff structure will increase by 2.76% on July 1, 2016 and will then
change on July 1 of each year according to a percentage variation equal
to “inflation - 0.8%” (excluding the impact of CRRA).

Lastly, a specific regulatory framework for the Gazpar smart meters
project was defined in the CRE ruling of July 17, 2014. It is based on the
allocation of a remuneration premium of 200 basis points on the
metering assets brought into service during the industrial deployment
phase (2017-2022), accompanied by a capped global mechanism to
encourage compliance with all the project's aspects, i.e.:

= biennial monitoring of compliance with the provisional timetable for
the project's deployment, with penalties for delays;

= annual monitoring of the unit cost of the meters;
= annual monitoring of the system's performance;

= annual monitoring of the investment expenditure on the IS and smart
meter chain.

GRDF strategy

GRDF's strategy is revised every four years. At the end of 2015, GRDF
reported on its previous company project and set new objectives for
2018 as follows:

= operational excellence in the performance of its businesses in order to
be recognized as committed professionals;

= promote natural gas as an energy of the future by demonstrating its
relevance to the energy mix on a daily basis;

= create a model with all businesses for a company that is responsible,
more open and collaborative.

1.3.4.6.4_ Transmission activities

Around 75% of GRTgaz is owned by ENGIE, with 25% owned by
Société d'Infrastructures Gaziéres (SIG), a consortium composed of
CNP Assurances, CDC Infrastructures and Caisse des Dépéts.

GRTgaz develops, operates and maintains a transmission network,
manages the natural gas flows that flow through it, and markets network
access services to gas suppliers. It also manages an interest in the
Megal Germany transmission network.

Facilities

GRTgaz wholly owns one of the longest high-pressure natural gas
transmission networks in Europe ® representing 32,323 km in France at
December 31, 2015. The main network (8,346 km) sends natural gas
from entry points (LNG terminals, interconnection points with
international pipeline networks) to the regional network. The regional
network (23,977 km) then directs it towards some 4,500 delivery points
serving industrial customers and distribution networks. GRTgaz
operates 27 compression stations.

In 2015, GRTgaz sent 53.6 billion m* of gas across the French network
(690 TWh).

In addition, GRTgaz has investments in the Megal transmission network
in Germany (1,167 km), representing a cumulative length “! of 429 km.

Legal and regulatory framework for gas transmission in
France

This activity takes place within a general framework (defined in
section 1.3.4.5.) aimed at ensuring the independence of the network
manager.

The Energy Code states that the construction and operation of natural
gas transmission pipelines must be authorized by a competent
administrative body, the conditions for which are set by Articles L. 555-7
et seq. and Articles R.555-2 et seq. of the Environment Code.
Authorizations are nominative and non-transferable. Entities that obtain
natural gas transmission authorizations must comply with the terms and
conditions of the authorizations.

On November 30, 2015, the French government and GRTgaz signed
the first public service agreement setting out the objectives and
procedures for implementing the public service missions(Art. L. 121-46
of the Energy Code). The agreement complies with the regulatory
framework (allocated resources, objectives) and takes into account not
only security of supply and continuity of delivery but also the new
challenges facing the gas industry (integration and attractiveness of the
French gas market, promotion of natural gas and renewable gas,
development of new uses, and so on).

Access to the gas transmission network: principles and
tariffs

Pursuant to its ruling on the pricing decision of December 13, 2012, the
CRE defined the methodology and set the tariffs known as “ATRT 5”,
which were to enter into effect on April1, 2013 for a period of
four years. The tariff structure is updated annually on April 1. Each year,
it is drawn up to cover the income authorized by the CRE, according to
observed inflation data and the best available forecasts of capacity
subscriptions for the year in question.

The blueprint for net operating expenses includes a productivity
objective. An incentive for cost control in investment programs is
introduced, along with a revision clause after two years enabling
adjustment of the blueprint for net operating expenses for 2015 and
2016, under certain conditions.

Presentation of the Group
1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

The basic actual rate of return before corporate income tax applied to
the regulated asset base (RAB) is 6.5%. An increase of 3% is retained
for investments already made, creating additional capacity on the main
network. In terms of new investment, the allocation of this increase is
restricted to the Val de Sane projects and decentralized odorization of
natural gas.

The CRE ruling on December 10, 2015 led to an average increase of
4.6% in the GRTgaz tariff at April 1, 2016.

The RAB 2015 for the transmission network stands at €7,579 million
(subject to validation by the CRE).

Transmission Europe

Megal GmbH & Co.KG (“Megal”), 49% owned" by GRTgaz
Deutschland (a wholly owned subsidiary of GRTgaz), and 51% by Open
Grid Europe, has a pipeline network connecting the Czech and Austrian
borders to the French border. Megal has granted rights to use its assets
to GRTgaz Deutschland and to Open Grid Europe, which separately
manage the transmission service purchased by the shippers on their
part of the network. GRTgaz Deutschland GmbH markets approximately
58% of the capacity of the Megal network.

Transmission business strategy

The GRTgaz strategy aims to ensure its development in the long term
both in France and internationally by:

= contributing to a better integration in the European markets either
through investments or agreements negotiated with other
transmission network managers (for example, with Switzerland's
FluxSwiss and Italy's Snam Rete Gas to create the first major physical
entry point of natural gas in France from Switzerland, in Oltingue,
Haut-Rhin;

= promoting new uses of gas (for industry or mobility, for example),
developing renewable natural gas through the injection of biomethane
into the transmission network, and promoting research into
maximizing the benefit of surplus renewable energy (power to gas);

= continuing to grow internationally, in countries where gas
consumption is growing fast, in close collaboration with other Group
entities.

(1) In 2013, GRTgaz sold its shares in Austrian carrier BOG and increased its stake in MEGAL from 44% to 49%.

1.3.6 Solairedirect

On September 3, 2015, ENGIE acquired Solairedirect, which has.
reported to the Corporate office since December 31, 2015.

Solairedirect is a company with global reach in the solar energy sector.
With its market share of 13.29% (total) et 22.37% (2015) in France as of
December 31, 2015 in terms of megawatts (MW) of capacity into
service and its proven experience in developing photovoltaic power
units in France and abroad, the company is taking opportunities to
expand in the emerging sector of competitively priced solar energy in
various markets worldwide

Most of Solairedirect’s business is focused on large-scale photovoltaic
power units, including ground-mounted solar farms and roof installations
generating more than 1 MW of power.

Solairedirect operates in three areas, aiming with this structure to
capture maximum value at each life stage of a photovoltaic project:

= “Development and Construction”, which encompasses project
development, engineering, and the supply and installation of
photovoltaic power units,

= “Asset Servicing”, involving operating, maintenance and management
services relating to photovoltaic power units under long-term
contracts (20-25 years), and

= “Investment Management", involving the management and
enhancement by Solairedirect of its portfolio of investments in
photovoltaic power units.

At December 31, 2015, Solairedirect had developed, built and marketed
49 solar farms with total installed capacity of 392,5 MW in France and 9
solar farms with total installed capacity of 120.3 MW in South Africa,
India, the US and Chile. The Group is currently installing 17 solar farms
in France, Chile and India which will have total installed capacity of
229.5 MW when complete.

Presentation of the Group
1.3 Description of business lines in 2015

Capitalizing on its experience in France and through its network of
investors and leading financial institutions in the solar energy market,
Solairedirect is positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities
offered by markets combining high levels of sunlight, easy access to
financing and a market dynamic that favors the competitiveness of solar
energy compared to other energy sources. Apart from the solar farms
mentioned above, which had already begun selling energy or were being
installed at December 31, 2015, Solairedirect has potential projects with
total capacity of 5,855 MW in various stages of development, including
655 MW at the backlog ® stage, 1,807 MW at the pipeline stage“, and
3,393 MW at the qualified lead stage“. Backlog projects account for
67% of Solairedirect’s business, while pipeline projects and qualified
leads account in photovoltaic markets outside France account for 94%,
a sign of the increasing globalization of its activities.

Solairedirect offers investors in the photovoltaic industry a
comprehensive range of turnkey solutions, enabling them to invest in
photovoltaic facilities generating renewable power with no greenhouse
gas emissions (GHGs) under financial conditions that offer high cash
flow visibility. For each project, Solairedirect makes a strategic decision
either to transfer control of the project company that it has created to
equity investors at the time of the investment decision (the greenfield
stage), in which case, it provides, installs and puts into service
production facilities on behalf of the investors under one or more turnkey
contracts, or it makes this transfer after the photovoltaic facility has
begun selling electricity and has reached the provisional or definitive
reception stage (the brownfield stage). In the latter case, Solairedirect
benefits in its consolidated financial statements from recurring revenues
from electricity sales from the time that the facility is commissioned until
control of the project company that owns the operational photovoltaic
facility is transferred to the investors. In both cases, Solairedirect may
provide operational, maintenance and management services for the
solar facilities under long-term contracts.

1.5 Innovation, research and technologies policy

1.5.1 Innovation

To be leader in the energy transition in Europe, the Group relies on
innovation to meet its customers’ new requirements.

ENGIE created a new entity in February 2014 called “Innovation,
Marketing and New Business”, intended to support changes on mature
energy markets and the convergence between energy services and
information technologies. Its aim is to position the Group at the forefront
of these changes by developing additional growth vectors and new
ways of doing business within the Group. Four priority sectors have
been identified by the Group:

= smart energy management;

= decentralized generation and energy storage;
= cities, regions and mobility;

= energy efficiency and home comfort.

New tools and processes have been deployed to foster entrepreneurial
creativity and to ensure that innovation promotes the Group's long-term
commercial development. A social network for innovation,
“innov@ENGIE”, was launched in mid-2014 for Group employees. This
internal tool is intended to boost the innovation dynamic in the Group
and promote innovation among employees. At December 31, 2015,
innov@ENGIE had over 8,700 members. On average, five new product
or business ideas are submitted each week. At the end of 2015,
350 ideas had been submitted.

To turn these ideas into products, an incubation process for employee
projects was created. At December 31, 2015, 14 teams of Group

employees were developing projects in external incubators created from
partnerships primarily in France (Paris Région Lab, Le Village, Agoranov,
Atlanpole, Euratechnologie, and Midi-Pyrénées), Belgium (Costation and
WSL), the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Brazil

This process enriches existing initiatives such as the Trophées de
l'Innovation (“Innovation Awards"), an in-house competition held each
year for innovative projects submitted by Group employees. In 2015, the
seventh annual Innovation Awards attracted around 500 submissions.

To strengthen its links with the innovation ecosystem of its host regions,
the Group partners with major innovation-themed events and has
launched around 20 calls for projects to startups. ENGIE launched a
number of public initiatives, such as a “Hackathon” on drones and
“Innovation Days” in Marseille and Bordeaux. In June 2015, ENGIE’s
“Innovation Week” saw the organization of 120 events involving Group
employees, startups and entrepreneurs in 21 countries.

The ENGIE New Ventures investment fund, with a €100-million
endowment, was launched in May 2014 to back innovative startups.
This fund was designed to take minority stakes in developing startups
linked to the Group's activities by offering them dual leverage: financial
leverage through investment and operational leverage with the Group's.
subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2015, there were eight new startups in fields such as
energy storage (AMS), networks dedicated to connected devices

1.5.2 Research and Technologies

ENGIE conducts research in an effort to harness and bring to maturity
tomorrow's technologies, which will set its businesses apart. Research
is also carried out to improve operational performance. This research,
which relies on partnerships with globally renowned organizations, helps
promote widespread recognition of the Group’s expertise and allows the
Group to win new contracts.

In 2015, Group expenditure on research and technological development
amounted to €190 million.

More than 1,000 researchers make up the Research and Technologies
network, which includes the Research & Technologies Department and
all Group entities conducting research specific to their fields of activity.

Risk factors

The material risks to which the Group is exposed, based on its own assessment, are described below. Other risks not mentioned or unknown to date
could also affect the Group. If these risks were to materialize, they could have a significant negative impact on the Group's operations, financial
position and earnings, image and outlook, and/or on the ENGIE share price.

ENGIE REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015


--- Page 50 ---

Risk factors
2.1 Risk management process

2.1 Risk management process

2.1.1 Enterprise risk management policy

The Group has adopted a policy of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM),
whose principles are consistent with professional standards (including
ISO 31000, Federation of European Risk Management Associations).
The policy sets out ENGIE’s ambition to “better manage its risks in order
to ensure its performance”.

The Group’s Enterprise Risk Management policy applies to the Group's
business processes and controlled entities, while observing the rules of
governance that apply to each entity.

This policy promotes risk-taking at a reasonable level from a legal
perspective, which is acceptable to generally held opinion and
economically viable. It stipulates that all managers are risk managers.
Generally, the Management Committees of the Group's entities are the
main bodies that determine the actions to be taken to manage risk,
except where an ad hoc risk committee has been created, such as for
market risk.

To achieve this aim, the Group has appointed the Director of Audit, Risk
and Internal Control as Chief Risk Officer, who oversees Risk
Management Department. The Chief Risk Officer's role is to ensure that

2.1.2 Crisis management

ENGIE may have to face crisis situations. The Group has defined a crisis
management and communication policy, which sets out general
operating principles and the roles of the various participants, and it has
set up a dedicated organization.

the Group has adequate expertise in all areas for effective risk
management. Risk analysis and coordination of action plans are
performed in collaboration with all the Group's functional lines.

Each year, the Group’s ERM process begins with a risk review by the
General Management Committee: each priority risk identified is
coordinated by a member of the General Management Committee or by
the head of the functional department concerned. The ERM campaign is
then launched across the Group, setting out guidelines for risk
management throughout the year. Finally, the Audit Committee
examines the risk review and issues an opinion on the effectiveness of
the risk management system, before reporting to the Board of Directors
(see Section 4.1.4 “Standing Committees of the Board of Directors’).

Knowledge of risks resulting from feedback from operating entities and
functional departments is supplemented by interviews with directors,
analysis of publications by external observers and review of major
events. The current risk management system has been maintained and
strengthened in the new Group organization.

The Group is thus equipped with a warning, analysis and
decision-making system to manage crises at the relevant organizational
level.

The efficiency of the system and the way that it is structured (emergency
plans, business continuity plans, etc.) are regularly assessed using
internal controls and appropriate training exercises.

2.1.3. Risk and insurance coverage

The ENGIE Insurance Department is responsible for preparing,
establishing and managing insurance programs in the areas of Group.
asset protection (against property damage and losses in earnings),
personal protection, third-party claims (civil liability) and automobile
insurance and prevention.

For each of these areas:

= the amounts insured depend on the financial risks resulting from
potential claim scenarios and coverage conditions offered by the
market (available capacities and price conditions);

= financing is optimized: low or moderate-level hazard risks are covered
by self-insurance plans, through deductibles and retentions or
through the use of the Group's reinsurance company, whose
commitments on a cumulative basis represent a maximum estimated
loss of approximately 0.3% of the Group’s 2015 revenues.

However, the Group could, in certain cases, be required to pay out
sizable compensation that the current insurance program does not

cover or could incur very high costs that its insurance policies do not
reimburse or reimburse inadequately. Although the Group has excellent
insurance coverage, specifically with regard to civil liability and
environmental risks, it could be liable beyond the maximum insured
amount or for events not covered (primarily due to the common
insurance exclusions).

2.1.3.1 Civil liability

A Directors and Officers civil liability program covers the representatives
of ENGIE, its subsidiaries and Group representatives within its equity
holdings.

A general civil liability program (including for environmental damage) has
been taken out for all the Group's entities in a total amount of
€800 million, all damages combined. This program operates either at the
first euro of liability or in excess of the underlying coverage taken out by
some entities (usually with cover of $50 million).

Risk factors
2.2 Risks related to the external environment

2.1.3.2 Nuclear civil liability

As an operator of nuclear power plants in Doel and Tihange (Belgium),
Electrabel's civil liability is governed by the Paris and Brussels
Conventions, which aim to ensure that victims receive compensation
and to encourage solidarity among signatory countries.

This liability falls exclusively on the operator of the facility where the
nuclear accident occurs. In exchange for this strictly objective liability,
the amount of compensation is capped per accident and establishes a
10-year statute of limitations. The signatory states to the conventions
also created a mechanism that provides additional compensation
beyond this maximum amount.

The nuclear civil liability insurance program taken out by Electrabel
complies with the Belgian national law requiring the operator to provide
financial guaranties or to take out civil liability insurance up to
€1.2 billion.

2.1.3.3 Property damage

The Group's business lines have property insurance covering the facilities
that they own, lease or manage on behalf of third parties, with the
exception of transmission and distribution network pipelines and heating
networks in France. The main programs provide cover based either on
new replacement value or on contractual limits per loss event. In the latter
case, the limits are set on the basis of major scenarios in accordance with
insurance market rules and available offers (cost and capacity).

Insurance covering business interruption and additional operating costs
is taken out based on each risk analysis and in consideration of existing
assistance plans.

Construction projects are covered by “Erection All Risks” programs.
taken out by the owner or operator, project manager or prime
contractor.

Exploration-production activity, which is carried out primarily offshore, is
covered by a specific insurance program tailored to this sector's risks
and in accordance with its practices.

2.1.3.4 Marine liability

An insurance contract covers LNG transportation by LNG vessel, limited
to €50 million per shipment.

Marine insurance contracts cover liability as ship owner (limited to
$6 billion, except for war risk limited to $500 million and pollution risk
limited to $1 billion) or as charterer (limited to $750 million). Damage to
ships is covered up to their agreed value.

2.1.3.5. Employee protection programs

The operating entities develop programs covering employees against
the risk of accidents and medical expenses, in accordance with
legislation in effect and pursuant to company agreements.

2.2 Risks related to the external environment

The Group is sensitive to the structural and economic risk factors that
affect the energy sector. These risks are all analyzed and measured as
part of strategic planning processes that allow the Group to anticipate

and prepare for changes in the external environment. The Group’s
research and innovation policy also helps to deal with strategic
developments (see Section 1.5.1 “Innovation").

2.2.1 Economic environment

2.2.1.1 Group markets

The Group's business depends on economic activity, which may lead to
reduced demand for energy and related services from the customers.
Changes in supply and demand on the energy markets affect the price
of commodities (gas, oil, coal, electricity, etc.). Such changes to the
external environment directly affect the Group’s business volumes and
margins.

In the OECD area, the structural decline in the demand for energy is a
result of improvements in energy efficiency (new and renovated
buildings, networks, and industrial processes), voluntary regulations and
an environmentally responsible attitude on the part of consumers
(private and public).

In non-OECD countries, energy demand is growing, but is sensitive to
the level of economic growth in these countries.

In view of these risks, monitoring mechanisms have been set up and
business models adjusted. The Group's geographic and sector diversity
provides a means of mitigation. In addition, the Group has a range of
energy services that it offers to industrial, business and residential
customers, both inside and outside Europe, to meet the specific
requirements of the energy transition.

In Europe, the lack of substantial growth, the rise of renewables and the
competitiveness of coal are generating excess capacity in thermal power
plants, impacting the Group’s generation fleet. Furthermore, stagnating
demand for natural gas could also result in excess capacity in Europe’s.
gas infrastructure, despite the fact that new uses are being developed,
such as biogas and power to gas.

ENGIE REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015


--- Page 52 ---

Policies aimed at reducing CO, emissions, renewable energy support
systems, and other regulatory and tax systems increase the complexity
of the competitive balance among different forms of energy and may
compromise the profitability of existing assets and create uncertainty
over relevant technology choices for the future (including gas,
renewables, nuclear, and coal).

In the short term, the Group has optimized its generation fleet and is
managing market risk (see 2.5.1 “Commodities market risk”). The Group.
closed or mothballed several thermal generation units in 2015. In the
medium-term, the Group intends to propose a new energy market
model in Europe, specifically as part of the Magritte initiative. In the
longer term, a technology watch enables the Group to develop strategic
scenarios that anticipate changes in the energy mix.

2.2.1.2 Competitive environment

In its different businesses, the Group competes with players with
increasingly diverse profiles, both in terms of size - with major
international players and local emerging players - and sectors. The
decentralization of systems due to the energy transition has lowered
barriers to entry to some activities (photovoltaic power, services),
allowing smaller players to compete with the Group.

Risk factors
2.2 Risks related to the external environment

The emergence of digital and smart energy technologies has impacted
the gas and electricity value chain, as well as services in general, with
new competitors from information technology, telecommunications and
equipment manufacturers. The Group is rationalizing its operations and
processes to adapt its cost structure, enhance its integrated position on
the value chain, and develop offers tailored to changes in its
environment.

2.2.1.3. Changes in the business model

The energy sector is changing rapidly: in technologies (solar and wind
power and electricity storage), in customer requirements (climate
change), and in the structure of competition and increased digitization in
the sector. In response to these changes, the Group has established a
structure dedicated to innovation and new activities with representatives
in its organization, in order to provide tailored solutions to its customers
and prepare for future sources of growth.

The Group is focused on developing renewable energy sources and
developing services specifically for the energy transition. The roll-out of
the Group's new organization, even if it involves the same execution risk
as any major project, will enable the Group to implement its
development strategy.

2.2.2. Regulatory and political environment

The legal and regulatory landscape for the Group's businesses is
changing in terms of both environmental and social issues and due to
energy sector regulation.

2.2.2.1. Environmental and social legislation

The Group's businesses are subject to a host of laws and regulations
that address environmental protection, promote energy systems with
zero or low greenhouse gas emissions, reduce energy consumption,
protect health and develop safety standards. The legislative bills and
regulatory texts mentioned below would particularly impact the Group’s.
strategy and results:

= European climate change and energy policy to the 2030 horizon is
aimed at promoting energy efficiency, reducing CO2 emissions, and
increasing the contribution of renewable energy sources to the energy
mix;

@ the French Energy Transition Act provides greater visibility with regard
to carbon targets and steering of the energy transition. Vigilance must
be exercised when implementing certain measures as these changes
take place, particularly support mechanisms for renewable energy,
competitive tenders for hydroelectric concessions, and measures to
combat fuel poverty, the scope of ambition and timetable of which
present real challenges for all stakeholders;

= changes in European and national regulations on CO, allowances and
prices have affected the CO, market in Europe and have
consequences for the relative competition between natural gas and
coal power generation. Increasing numbers of countries are adopting
such regulations. At the European level, the post-2020 review of the
European GHG allowance trading system is a major factor. In the
non-ETS sector, a carbon price has been established in the French

(1) See 1.1.4 Strategic priontties.

Energy Transition Act to calculate national taxes on the consumption
of energy products and natural gas;

= the amendment of the policy document referring to the best available
techniques for large combustion facilities could lead to substantial
changes at some European sites. Similarly, the new directive for
medium-sized combustion facilities adopted in 2015 could bring new
restrictions;

= the EU Directive on energy efficiency adopted in late 2012 has to be
transposed into the various Member State laws and entails, in France,
for example, a doubling of the Energy Savings Certificates obligation
in the third period (2015-2017), which could have an impact on the
Group's margins in France;

= the EU regulation on data protection, which is scheduled for early
2018, may have an impact on ENGIE’s commercial activities in the
coming years;

the bill providing a framework for biodiversity regulation in France
includes a provision to include the “Avoid, Reduce, Offset” principle in
the environmental code. This principle has also been applied to the
regulations of other countries.

The increasing implementation of “soft law” worldwide requires the
Group to analyze its activities through an additional lens that includes
even more input and expectations from stakeholders.

The Group is rationalizing its generation fleet and its project portfolio so
that it can take advantage of opportunities, and is working to limit all of
these risks, principally as part of a proactive environmental and social
policy (see Section 3.3 “Environmental information”). In 2015, the Group
decided to no longer pursue new developments in coal, believing that a
carbon price will steadily be established in the world’s various regions
and that coal-fired power plants will be adversely affected in the future.

Risk factors
2.2 Risks related to the external environment

2.2.2.2 Sector regulations

In some Member States and at European level, and in some other
regions including the United States, Asia-Pacific, Mexico and Brazil,
public measures have been implemented in the energy sector through
regulation and the extension of regulatory powers in the area of
competition. They can occur by the high taxation of the profits made by
energy companies, the withdrawal of funds established for the
dismantling of nuclear power plants, by changes to the market operating
rules and supply security, by the regulator's intervention in the
deregulated sector to encourage the development of competition or else
by the desire to hand back control of utilities to local authorities. National
budget deficits and high levels of indebtedness contribute to increase
this risk.

Some regulatory changes may alter the risk profile of the Group and
impact its earnings and its business model:

= on February 25, 2015, the European Commission published the key
elements of its “Energy Union” policy. Some developments are
positive, mainly because they introduce greater visibility, such as the
formalization of an energy and climate framework for 2030 based on
a stronger carbon market, and the redesign of the electricity market
model. Others might have a variable impact on the Group's activities,
such as new rules on security of gas supply, the reworking of the
Third Energy Package and the oversight of intergovernmental
agreements. In the work under way on the new electricity market
structure and its evolutions in 2016, the Group is paying close
attention to the framework that will enable coordinated development
of national capacity markets;

the implementation of common rules for the European internal
electricity and gas market (including the electricity and gas network
codes) are intended to complete the creation of a real internal energy
market. These changes may require the technical adjustment of our
Operations;

in February 2013, the European Commission adopted a Council
Directive proposal to levy a tax on financial transactions whose entry
into force is scheduled for January 1, 2017. The implementing
provisions and exemptions, specifically the criteria for categorizing
businesses as financial institutions, have yet to be agreed by the
11 Member States participating in enhanced cooperation;

the guidelines for state aid for energy and the environment, published
in 2014, have impacted the Group's activities, particularly national
support mechanisms for renewable energy sources (to gradually
integrate them into the market) and energy efficiency, infrastructure
financing, environmental tax exemptions and fee waivers linked to the

financing of renewables (preferential rates for industrial partners), and
capacity payment mechanisms;

= in Brazil, the Group is exposed to regulatory changes on electricity
markets. For example, drought conditions could result in restricted
availability of hydro generation and greater exposure to market
volatility to replace lost production;

= in the United States, the developments in progress and changes in
electricity market regulation could lead to uncertainty in terms of the
Group earnings in this region;

@ in the Asia Pacific region and in Mexico, energy market deregulation
and tariff renewal could also increase uncertainty about the Group's
performance.

Through concerted action as part of the “Magritte” initiative, which
brings together the CEOs of the European energy companies, and
through its presence in EU and Member State institutions, the Group.
tries to anticipate any legislation likely to affect it, and formulates
proposals for decision-makers. The Group also partially diversifies
regulatory and legislative risk by conducting its business in a number of
different countries. Some regulatory developments also offer new
market opportunities for the Group's activities (see the description of the
legislative and regulatory framework in which the various entities operate
in Section 1).

2.2.2.3. Controlled, administered or regulated
tariffs

In France, a portion of the Group's sales are made in the context of
regulated tariffs. French laws and rules, European regulation and
decisions by regulators (in particular, the French Energy Regulation
Commission (CRE) for decisions on tariffs for access to certain
infrastructures) may affect the Group's sales, profits or profitability, in the
event of the partial impact of procurement, infrastructure and
commercial costs on natural gas selling prices or the partial impact of
costs on gas infrastructure access tariffs or electricity sales from
renewable energy.

Also in France, the opening of the electricity market to suppliers other
than the traditional operator, in addition to the opening for very large
customers, is still limited and could be jeopardized by the emergence of
price reductions arising from regulated tariffs that replace and compete
with commercial offers.

Price control mechanisms also exist in other countries, specifically
Belgium, Italy, Romania, Brazil and Mexico, for energy generation,
distribution and sales.

ENGIE REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015


--- Page 54 ---

2.2.2.4 Social acceptability

To engage in its activities, the Group must hold various permits and
authorizations. Dealing with the regulatory authorities concerned to
obtain or renew these can be a long and costly process. In addition, the
Group may face opposition from the local population or associations
during the installation or operation of certain equipment, or in relation to
public energy price protests.

The Group therefore implements widespread consultation upstream of
its projects, forges partnerships with civil society and ensures the
positive economic impact of its activities, in line with community
expectations (see Section 3.4 “Social information”).

2.2.2.5 Country risk

The Group is present, operates or procures natural gas in a growing
number of countries. The Group is therefore exposed to risks including

Risk factors
2.2 Risks related to the external environment

changes in regulation, sovereign default, convertibility, expropriation,
corruption, acts of war, the extra-territorial effects of some legislation,
etc. Moreover, in some countries, the Group might be unable to defend
its rights before the local courts in the event of a dispute with
governments or other local public entities.

The diversity of the Group's locations results in some mitigation of
country risk. Warning thresholds by country or group of countries enable
the Group's exposure to be monitored. The Group also manages these
risks within partnerships or contractual negotiations adapted to each
location. It chooses its locations by applying a formal investment
procedure that appraises risk. The inclusion of international arbitration
clauses in contracts is applied as widely as possible. Regular monitoring
of economic and non-economic indicators relating to corruption, human
rights, and inequality is done in each country to assess the Group's
exposure to country risk.

2.2.3. Impact of climate

Significant climate changes (mainly in temperature, but also in terms of
water availability”) and wind) from one year to the next can cause
substantial fluctuations in the electricity and gas supply-demand
balance. These factors, which combine price and volume impacts and
which may intensify due to the future consequences of global warming,
have a direct effect on the Group's income.

Beyond annual changes, there has been a warming of the average
climate, although periods of extreme cold are possible in Europe.
Regulations require suppliers to provide storage capacity according to
their customer portfolio. If supplier bookings are not adequate, it could
lead to strong pressure on the supply-demand balance for gas in
Europe, including France.

2.2.4 Reputational risk

The Group is exposed to reputational risk, both directly and indirectly,
especially when the Group's values, ethics, operational excellence or
legitimacy as a utility are called into question.

In 2015, GDF SUEZ became ENGIE, in order to give the Group greater
visibility in relation to its commitment to the energy transition. The
flagship brand “ENGIE" (name and logotype) is registered in over one

(1) Availability of water resources for a dam or waterway, dependent on rainfall

Although the Group cannot protect itself against fluctuations in demand,
it is able to modulate its gas purchases and rationalize its electricity
production, which enables it to adapt its production and supply costs
(see Section 2.3.1 “Purchases and sales”).

In the longer term, the Group might be faced with an increase in
extreme events (flooding, water shortage, drought, etc.). The Group is
looking at ways of combining sustainable development and managing
the impact of climate change on its business, particularly as part of a
proactive environmental and social policy (see Section3.3
“Environmental information”).

hundred countries. As a vital part of the Group's intangible corporate
assets, the brand is constantly monitored to protect it against any
fraudulent use that could harm the Group's image.

Through its policies, organization, procedures and governance, the
Group endeavors to prevent operational risks (Section 2.3 “Operating
risks") and smear campaigns that could affect its reputation.

Risk factors
2.3 Operating risks

2.3 Operating risks

2.3.1 Purchases and sales

2.3.1.1. Purchase and sale of natural gas

The Group has established a portfolio composed in part of long-term,
take-or-pay contracts (see Section 1.3.1.6.1 “Central Western Europe’).

In case of major gas supply interruption (for example, due to an
interruption of Russian deliveries or an interruption of transit in Ukraine)
or an interruption of LNG supply (for example, from Yemen or Egypt),
the replacement cost for gas, including transportation, could be higher
and affect the Group’s margins. To mitigate this risk, the Group has a
number of tools for flexibility and modulation (flexibility in long-term
contracts, storage and regasification capacity, and purchasing in the
marketplaces) as well as a diversified portfolio.

Prices of long-term purchase contracts (partially indexed to the price
indices of oil products) may be decorrelated from selling prices or prices
in the gas markets. This spread might have a significant impact on the
Group's results. Long-term contracts include price adjustment clauses,
so that the economic balance between producer and buyer can be
altered. The Group's buy/sell margin may therefore change according to
price adjustments in LNG or gaseous gas contracts and the state of the
gas market in general.

Negotiations in recent years have led to the integration of market indices
in long-term contracts and/or to the reduction of the difference between
the contract price and market price. They have also led to increased
frequency of price revisions.

2.3.1.2 Purchase and sale of electricity

The Group is an electricity producer in Europe, the United States and
Australia, where the profitability of its assets is linked mainly to prices in
electricity markets. The economic climate or decisions by some states
regarding the electricity sector may lead to volatility in electricity prices,
which may have an impact on Group earnings.

The Group may also have to buy power to supply its customers, for
example to cover any non-availability of its fleet. These purchases are
optimized but could generate extra supply costs.

The Group monitors changes in its risk exposure and makes decisions
accordingly (see Section 2.5.1 “Commodities market risk”).

2.3.1.3. Operational risks related to the
purchase and sale of energy

The main risks related to regulated sales are outlined in Sections 2.2.2.2
“Sector regulations” and 2.2.2.3 “Controlled, administered or regulated
rates”.

In its portfolio optimization activities for physical assets (power plants,
long-term contracts, etc.) and customers, as well as in managing the
associated financial positions, the Group is exposed to operating risks
such as fraud, execution error, and process and system failure.
Operations are monitored via appropriate processes, and risks are taken
into account as part of the Group's internal control program, “INCOME”.
In addition, a specific system for increased monitoring of operating risks
has been set up in some of the Group's entities.

2.3.1.4. Purchase risks and supply chain risks
(excluding energy)

The performance of the Purchasing and Procurement function and its
ability to manage the associated risks affect all of the Group's activities.
Management of purchasing and supplier risks is monitored at Group
level: specifically, external risks that are regarded as having the biggest
impact, such as the failure of a major supplier, or the dependence of a
Group entity on a critical supplier, or vice versa.

The implementation of purchasing management by homogenous
supplier market has strengthened processes for selecting and qualifying
suppliers, and has enabled their performance to be monitored, thereby
limiting the impact of these risks on the Group's activities. Similarly, for
new projects, risk management covers specific purchase and
supplier/subcontractor risks (see Section 2.3.2.2 “Risks related to
development and major projects”).

Risk factors
2.3 Operating risks

2.3.2 Management of assets and development

2.3.2.1 Optimization of the asset and

investment portfolio

External expansion, notably by means of acquisitions, could lead the
Group to issue equity securities, or to borrow. Acquisitions present risks.
related to integration difficulties and failure to achieve expected benefits
and synergies. Risks related to the valuation of assets or liabilities or
non-achievement of expected results could arise at the end of the
acquisition process, resulting in provisions for asset impairment. The
Group also sells assets for which it may retain certain liability
guarantees.

The acquisition processes implemented by the Group, particularly during
due diligences, aim to assess to the greatest possible extent the
uncertainties related to these risks in such cases. The resulting appraisal
depends on the quality of the information transmitted to the Group and
is limited by the judicial and regulatory framework applicable under local
corporate law.

2.3.2.2 Risks related to development and
major projects

The Group bases its growth on various major industrial construction
projects, such as gas and electricity plants and dams, where it usually
acts as owner and/or operator. The profitability of these assets - whose
service life is several decades - depends greatly on cost control and
construction times, the operational performance of the industrial asset,
external phenomena (e.g. natural disasters and strike actions), regulatory
and fiscal changes and changes in the competitive environment and
markets over the long term, which could reduce the profitability of
certain assets or result in lost revenues or asset impairment.

The Group is also responsible for the facility design and construction
phases of some projects. Although these projects are always subject to
in-depth studies and the Group has acknowledged expertise,
construction deadlines may not always be met resulting in penalties,
construction costs may be higher than anticipated, the facilities’
performance may not comply with the specifications and subsequent
accidents may trigger the Group's civil liability, professional indemnity or
criminal liability. This could have a negative impact on the Group's image,
financial position, or earnings.

The Group has strengthened operational monitoring and oversight of
projects and is monitoring the portfolio of projects at Group level, which
provides the warnings needed to launch corrective action. A policy
governing supervision of construction projects and joint project
management methods have reinforced existing mechanisms within the
entities executing industrial projects.

In addition, the implementation of contract management arrangements
allows for better control of some of these risks, including through the
use of indemnification mechanisms, in respect of our customers, as well
as our suppliers and subcontractors. Insurance underwriting allows for
insurance claims to be indemnified and also improves prevention.

2.3.2.3. Risk linked to nuclear development

The Group actively pursues its projects in the development, construction
and operation of nuclear power plants. The Group has teamed up with
Toshiba Westinghouse (AP1000 technology) in the United Kingdom, and
is also a member of a consortium formed with Japanese groups
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Itochu (ATMEA1 technology) in Turkey.

It should be noted that these projects are currently still in the initial
development stage, and that the Group's financial exposure is therefore
not material.

The Group has established governance principles for development,
construction, operation and decommissioning based on its experience
as a nuclear power plant operator. It is also active in employee
recruitment, training and retention, both for facilities in operation, service
entities and Group projects.

2.3.2.4 Risks relating to partnerships and
minority investments

Partnerships and acquisitions of minority interests are one of the ways in
which the Group can share the economic and financial risks inherent to
some projects, by limiting its capital employed and allowing it to adapt
more appropriately to the specific context of local markets (see Note 3
to Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements”). As much as
possible, the Group protects itself against the risks resulting from joint
control or lack of control (such as a lack of information or an impact on
the Group's reputation) with the signing of shareholders’ agreements on
governance and information reporting, and with the role of the director
representing the Group.

However, changes to the project, the economic situation, the partner's
strategy or even the local political and economic environment may, in
some cases, lead to the failure of a partnership or changes in its control
or governance, a change of control or a partnership's governance, or to
a disinvestment.

These situations may lead the Group to develop contractual
arrangements for deadlock resolution or, in the event of conflict with the
partner(s), to seek a solution before the relevant courts or arbitration
bodies.

Risk factors
2.3 Operating risks

2.3.3. Legal risks

The Group faces legal risks in all its businesses and on global markets.
These risks arise from the legal and regulatory framework, from
operations, from partnerships, from purchases of companies, and from
contracts signed with customers and suppliers (see respective
subsections of this Chapter 2).

In the course of its operations, the Group is engaged in a certain
number of legal disputes and arbitration procedures, and is also subject

to investigations and procedures. The main investigations and
procedures are described in Note 27 of Section 6.2. “Consolidated
financial statements”. With the exception of these procedures, and to
the Company's knowledge, no other governmental, legal or arbitration
procedure (including a suspended or threatened procedure "’ exists that
is likely to have, or has had, a material impact on the financial position or
profitability of the Company and/or Group in the past 12 months.

2.3.4 Ethical risks

Any breach of the ethical principles of the Group could expose it to
ethical and legal risks (see Note 27 to Section 6.2 “Consolidated
financial statements”).

Ethics policies are established to avoid, as far as possible, the
occurrence of such risks. Reporting to the General Secretary, who is the
Group's Compliance Officer, the Ethics and Compliance Division
promotes their implementation within the group, through the managerial
line and the network of Compliance Officers.

Ethical risks (see Section 3.1 “Ethics and compliance") are analyzed
each year and action plans are defined. Moreover, risks relating to
human rights are specifically assessed at the operational level as part of
the Group's risk analysis process.

In addition, the policy on the analysis of ethical risk relating to investment
projects and human rights guidelines applicable to the whole Group
require the entities to analyze corruption risks and human rights risks for
every new project.

2.3.5 Risks related to human resources

2.3.5.1 Workforce competences

Developments in the Group's activities (the impact of digitization, for
example), as well as its international growth, require new know-how and
the mobility of certain employees. In addition, demographic aging affects
specific technical sectors. An active policy of mobility between entities
and between activities, combined with policies for professionalization,
for the development of support functions, for the recognition of experts,
and for attractiveness, through remuneration measures and incentives
tailored for the environment, is also implemented (see Section 3.2.1
“Human resources development policies”). The Group has strengthened
its workforce forecasting through its professional observatory. The
opening of negotiations for a labor agreement will make skills forecasting
the main focus of the consultation with social partners.

(1) This term means investigations or controls that have begun.

2.3.5.2. Employee commitment and managerial
behaviors

Rapid developments in the energy markets and the new company-wide
project will bring major changes, requiring support and guidance for
employees and managers. These changes must be given meaning so.
that all line managers can buy into them and employees can play an
active role in their mobility and become change agents.

The Group invests in the promotion of behavior that helps in the
development of staff, relying in particular on the deployment of the
“ENGIE Management Way” (see Section 3.2 “Social information”), and
emphasizes the prevention of psycho-social risks. Particular attention is
also paid to the managerial chain to provide assistance in its role in
change management.

2.3.6 Risks related to health and safety and protection of Group assets

2.3.6.1 Health and safety at work

The Group is committed to eradicating fatal accidents and reducing
occupational accidents and illnesses. The Group health and safety
policy was agreed with the union federations at European level and
subsequently worldwide. An action plan was drawn up for 2010-2015,
and a new plan was defined for 2016-2020 (see Section 3.2.6 “Health
and safety policy”).

Addressing the risk of death in the workplace is part of the overall
system for controlling the risk of occupational accidents. On this basis, a
specific plan for the sustainable prevention of fatal accidents was.
launched in 2012. It relies specifically on adherence to the nine
“life-saving rules” in all of the Group's businesses.

2.3.6.2 Employee safety

The international scope of the Group means it may be exposed to a
number of health and safety risks, the threat of which warrants a specific
organization entrusted to the Safety Department which has established
a country watch. In this way, the Group continually evaluates the risks of
terrorism, armed conflicts and confrontation with criminal organizations.
Geographic areas are subject to classification according to specific
prevention and protection measures. To accomplish this mission, the

Group relies on State services as well as specialized providers. Should a
specific situation occur, the crisis unit can be mobilized to provide
exceptional resources, for instance in the event of an evacuation.

2.3.6.3. Protection of tangible and intangible

Group assets

The Group's sites and industrial or tertiary facilities, which make up its
tangible Group assets, may be exposed to malicious acts. Information,
whether digital, physical or even verbal in form, constitutes the Group's
intangible assets and may also be exposed to the same malicious acts.

To combat this type of risk, the Group implements a policy for the
protection of tangible and intangible Group assets, covering technical
(including IT), legal, managerial and organizational areas. Sensitive sites
where tangible corporate assets are located are subject to protective
measures tailored to the local situation and revised according to the
actual threat status. The Group is continuing to act to protect its
intangible Group assets, in order to deal with any reported incidents and
to prevent any internal or external action aimed at capturing and using
sensitive information. An Information Security Committee, with members
from all Group functional departments and chaired by the General
Secretary, coordinates and manages the Group's security policies. It
reports to the General Management Committee.

2.3.7 Risks related to information systems

The introduction of new technologies, the evolution of industrial control
systems and the development of new uses (e.g. social networking)
expose the Group to new threats. Cyber-attacks and hacking attempts.
are increasingly targeted and carried out by specialists, and can target
the company along with its customers or partners. More generally, IT
system failure could result in information losses or leaks, delays and extra
costs that could be detrimental to the Group's activities or image. New
regulations on information security require strengthening our protection
measures.

In response, the Group has set up prevention and security measures for
its information systems and data that are tailored to the risks identified.

2.4 Industrial risks

The areas of activity in which the Group operates entail major industrial
risks capable of causing harm to persons and property, and exposing it
to claims for civil, criminal and environmental liability. These risks may
concern facilities that belong to the Group or are managed by the Group.
on behalf of third parties (manufacturers or local authorities), or facilities

Large-scale attacks are managed by the Incident Management
Committee (IMC), which reports to the Safety Department. In connection
with its internal control policy and security policy, these organizational,
functional, technical and legal security measures are subject to
continuous controls (alert monitoring, infrastructure supervision, etc.),
testing operations (intrusion tests, social engineering tests, cyber-crises
management tests, etc.), and campaigns to raise awareness. The Group
also invests in the architecture of its systems to improve their security
and performance. The complexity of these projects could generate
unexpected costs and delays.

where the Group's employees work. The industrial safety of the facilities
that the Group operates is one of its major concerns. The handling of
these risks is subject to in-depth monitoring and specific targeted
investments, and audits of the facilities in question are performed
regularly.

Risk factors
2.4 Industrial risks

2.4.1 Industrial facilities and Seveso sites

The Group operates and builds systems for gas transmission,
distribution and storage systems, exploration-production facilities, LNG
tankers, regasification and gas liquefaction facilities, electrical power
plants, and hydro facilities and provides services in an_ industrial
environment. Some of these facilities are classified as high-threshold
Seveso sites.

Risks can stem, for example, from operating incidents, design flaws or
from external events beyond the Group's control (including third-party
actions and natural disasters). Industrial accidents can cause injuries,
loss of life or major property and/or environmental damage, as well as
activity interruptions and operating losses.

The Group carries out its industrial activities in compliance with a
framework of safety regulations, including the “Seveso Ill European

Directive“. These industrial risks are controlled by implementing a
safety management system at these sites based on the principle of
continuous improvement, which is intended to reduce the level of
residual risk by responding to the highest risks on a priority basis.
Moreover, industrial security is part of the Group's internal control
program. The Group conducts periodic audit and control missions to
ensure that these measures are effectively implemented.

A specific action plan for the protection of industrial control systems,
linked to industrial processes, is being implemented. It aims to prevent
the risk of activity interruption or accidents due to cyber-attacks.

For the most part, these risks are covered by insurance policies. In the
event of a major claim, these policies could prove insufficient (see
Section 2.1.3 “Risk and insurance coverage”)

2.4.2 Environmental pollution

Facilities that the Group owns or manages on behalf of third parties may
entail risks of damage to the natural environment (air, water, soil, the
habitat and biodiversity), and may pose health risks to consumers,
neighboring residents, employees and subcontractors. These health and
environmental risks are governed by strict national and international
regulations. Non-compliance with these environmental standards or a
process failure can have a significant negative impact on the Group's
image, its business, financial situation, earnings and outlook, and lead to

the engagement of its liability as a legal entity. Any amounts set aside,
insured or guaranteed may be insufficient. Complaints and convictions
relating to the environment are reported in Section 3.3.4.9 “Active
prevention of environmental risks”

Health and environmental risks are regularly monitored by the Group, by
external auditors and by governmental authorities, both for operational
sites and closed facilities, such as former gas plants.

2.4.3 Nuclear power plants in Belgium

The Group owns and operates seven nuclear reactors of the pressurized
water type at two nuclear electricity production sites at Doel and
Tihange in Belgium. Since the commissioning of the first reactor in 1974,
these sites have been without any major nuclear safety incidents that
could have resulted in danger to employees, subcontractors, the general
population or the environment. However, they could present civil liability
risks for the Group, specifically in the event of a nuclear accident or the
discharging of large quantities of radioactive material into the
environment.

All persons working at Group nuclear power plants have appropriate
qualifications, in particular control room operators. During operations,
compliance with safety rules and conditions at the facilities are subject
to inspection by the Belgian Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (AFCN),
assisted by Bel-V, its technical support subsidiary. In addition, both
nuclear sites are OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001 and EMAS-certified.

Electrabel takes account of feedback from accidents or incidents to
continuously improve the security of its facilities. Electrabel has pursued
the action plan implemented after the Fukushima accident in 2011,
particularly in response to more severe natural disasters and the risk of
cyber-attack. Similarly, after the sabotage of a turbine at the Doel plant
in 2014, Electrabel stepped up its existing action plan to reduce the risk
of internal threats at all its nuclear sites. In 2015, Electrabel established
the “Rigor and Responsibility” action plan, designed to reinforce the
safety culture at its nuclear sites. This was in response to a “pro justitia"
of the AFCN on August 3, 2015 which stated that the safety culture at
the Tihange plant had declined. The risk of terrorist attack was also.
reassessed and armed protection measures were approved and are
currently being rolled out.

In 2012, hydrogen-induced flaws created in the manufacturing process
were detected in the vessel walls of the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 reactors.
The other vessels, which were manufactured differently, were also
inspected with no signs of flaws detected. The Doel 3 and Tihange 2
reactors were not authorized to operate in 2015, which impacted the
Group's financial results. In 2015, Electrabel continued its efforts to
comply with all the AFCN's requests. On July 17, 2015, it submitted a
new supporting report for each of the two vessels to the nuclear safety
authorities. In late November 2015, the AFCN authorized the restart of
Doel 3 and Tihange 2, after a positive evaluation of the report with the
help of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL-USA).

The government agreed to an extension of the operating life of Doel 1
and Doel 2 beyond 40 years. The parliament voted to confirm this
decision at the end of June 2015, but the agreement in principle with the
government on the accord setting out the economic parameters for this
extension has yet to be consolidated in legislation. In addition, the
10-year extension from 2015 for Tihange 1 took effect on October 1,
2015, with a program of associated works that will continue until 2019
(see Section 1.3.1 “Energy Europe" and Note 12.3.1 to Section 6.2
“Consolidated financial statements”).

The operation of nuclear power plants is regulated in part by radioactive
waste authorizations. The Group therefore reduces its discharges of

Risk factors
2.4 Industrial risks

radioactive liquid and gaseous effluents as much as possible, while
controlling the volume of low and medium radioactive waste. In Belgium,
all nuclear waste management is the responsibility of the National
Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile Material (ONDRAF)
In 2013, barrels of medium radioactive waste from the Doel plant, stored
at Belgoprocess, were subject to additional checks related to the
discovery of a gel-like substance on the surface of the barrels. However,
this issue has no effect on the safety of the environment or the health of
the population. Studies are in progress in liaison with ONDRAF. The
phenomenon was not detected at the Tihange plant, where a different
encasement process is used, one that does not contain aggregates.

Finally, spent nuclear fuel is stored at electricity production sites pending
a political decision on the fuel cycle downstream process. Costs
associated with the management of spent fuel and the dismantling of
facilities are included in the costs of electricity production from nuclear
sources and are the subject of provisions. The assumptions and
sensitivities regarding the assessment of these amounts are detailed in
Note 18.2 to Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements”.

Objections have been raised in various EU countries to the Belgian
government's extension or starting up of some nuclear plants.

2.4.4 Exploration and production of hydrocarbons

The exploration and production of hydrocarbons are activities subject to
significant risks such as geological hazards and risks of industrial
accidents.

Geological hazards are related to difficulties in investigating subsoil, the
physical characteristics of oil or gas fields and those of hydrocarbons. In
fact, estimates of discovered reserves must be large enough and have a
positive economic analysis in order for said reserves to be exploited.
During production, reserves may turn out to be lower than expected and
this may adversely affect the economics of their use.

Risks of industrial accidents are related to hydrocarbon leaks, fire,
explosion and the loss of control of wells.

In order to reduce the impact of these risks, the Group:

= conducts its activities by sharing risks as part of consortia in which it
may be an operator or simply a partner. As far as possible, the Group
teams up with companies that are known for their expertise, rules and
high level of commitment to safety and accident prevention;

= carries out its operations under the rules of a safety management
system (see also Section 2.4.1) based on the ISO 14001 and
OHSAS 18001 international standards, and takes into account good
practices in the E&P industry, particularly those of the International
Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP);

= has its hydrocarbon reserves regularly assessed by an independent
third party;

= insures its facilities against structural damages, loss of production and
civil liability lawsuits, including pollution, in accordance with industry
practice.

Risk factors
2.5 Financial risks

2.5 Financial risks

2.5.1 Commodity market risk

The Group is chiefly exposed to two kinds of commodity market risk:
price risk relating directly to fluctuating market prices, and volume risk
(weather risk and/or risk depending on economic activity). The Group is
exposed to these risks, particularly in relation to gas, electricity, coal, oil
and oil products, other fuels, CO, and other green products (see
Section 6.1.1.7 “Outlook”).

With the exception of trading activities, market risks are assessed by
means of their impact on EBITDA. Accordingly, the main risk indicators
for managing the energy portfolios include sensitivity to unit price
changes, the EBITDA at Risk, portfolio hedging ratios and stress tests
based on predefined unfavorable scenarios. For trading activities, and in
accordance with market standards, risk indicators include sensitivities,
Value at Risk (VaR) and stress tests (see Note 17.1.1 to Section 6.2
“Consolidated financial statements”).

The Group has implemented a specific governance process to control
market and counterparty risks based on (i) the general principle of

2.5.2 Counterparty risk

Due to its financial and operational activities, the Group is exposed to
the risk of default by its counterparties (customers, suppliers, partners,
intermediaries, banks).

The impact of this may be felt in terms of payment (non-payment for
services or deliveries made), delivery (non-delivery of paid supplies or
services) or assets (loss of financial investments).

separation of risk management and operational activities, (ii) a
Group-level Energy Market Risks Committee that is responsible for
validating risk policies and monitoring consolidated exposure,
(ii) following market and counterparty risk mandates, and (iv) a specific
risk control functional line coordinated by the Finance Department.

Most of its electricity production activity outside Europe and the United
States is secured by long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs),
often with local authorities, in which variations in operating expenses, in
particular fuels, are transferred as “pass-throughs” into electricity sale
prices. This substantially limits exposure to price fluctuation risks, even if
the transfer is imperfect in some contracts.

The Group also relies on derivative products linked to energy in order to
provide its customers with hedging instruments and to hedge its own
positions.

These risks are managed via framework agreements that use standard
mechanisms such as third-party guarantees, netting agreements and
margin calls or by the use of dedicated hedging instruments.
Operational activities may also involve prepayments or suitable recovery
procedures (especially for retail customers).

2.5.3 Foreign exchange risk

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks defined as the impact
on the balance sheet and the income statement of exchange rate
fluctuations as it performs its operational and financial activities. These
are broken down into (i) a transactional risk related to current operations,
(li) a specific transactional risk related to investment, merger-acquisition
or disposal projects, (iii) a translational risk related to assets outside the
Eurozone, and (iv)a risk related to consolidation in euros of the
subsidiaries’ accounts where the functional currency is not the euro.
This risk is concentrated in dollar-denominated equity investments (in
the United States and on assets considered on a dollarized basis), as
well as equity investments located primarily in Brazil, Australia and the
UK.

For an analysis of foreign exchange risk sensitivity, see Note 16.1.3.2 to
Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements”.

As part of the Group's foreign exchange risk policy, recurring
transactional risk is subject to systematic hedging in cases where this
risk is material and almost certain to materialize. During the examination
of investment projects, the specific transactional risk is subject to a
case-by-case hedging strategy. Finally, translational risk is covered by
partial hedging strategies subject to a reasonable hedging cost and
sufficient market liquidity related to the risk of currency depreciation

ENGIE REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015

2.5.4 Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations which partly depend
on decisions by central banks. The Group's objective is to control its
borrowing costs by limiting the impact of interest rate changes on its
income statement and, with this in view, to create a balanced
distribution among the various reference rates over the medium-term.
The Group's policy is therefore to diversify the net debt reference rates
among fixed, variable and protected variable (“capped variable”) rates.
This distribution may change within the limits set by management
according to the market situation.

2.5.5 Liquidity risk

Liquidity is based on the regular renewal of various financing tools
available to the Group such as credit lines, bond financing or other
financing tools, to ensure their availability and their adequacy in relation
to financing requirements. The Group has pre-agreed credit facilities
appropriate for the scale of its operations and for the timing of
contractual debt repayments. Note 16.2.1 to Section 6.2 “Consolidated
financial statements” explains the distribution of the various forms of
financing used.

Risk factors
2.5 Financial risks

The breakdown by type of interest rate of the outstanding financial debt
and sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk are presented in
Note 16.1.4.1. and Note 16.1.4.2, respectively, to Section 6.2
“Consolidated financial statements.”

In order to manage the interest rate structure of its net debt, the Group
uses hedging instruments, mainly rate swaps and options. Managed
centrally, rate positions are reviewed periodically and when any new
financing is raised. This management is subject to a risk mandate: any
substantial change in the rate structure requires prior approval from the
Finance Department.

ENGIE pools the majority of the cash flow requirements and surpluses of
the Group's majority owned subsidiaries, as well as most of their
medium- and long-term external financing requirements. Financing
vehicles (long-term and short-term) provide centralization, as do the
Group's dedicated cash-pooling vehicles in France, Belgium and
Luxembourg.

2.5.6 Impairment risk

Assumptions and estimates are made to calculate the recoverable value
of goodwill and tangible and intangible fixed assets, with particular
reference to market outlook, which is more sensitive for certain
operations. These assumptions and estimates are needed to assess
cash flows and the discount rate to apply. Any change in these

assumptions could have a significant effect on the amount of the
recoverable value and could lead to changes in the impairment to be
recognized (see Note 1.3.1.2 to Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial
statements”).

2.5.7. Equity risk

As of December31, 2015, the Group holds a number of
non-consolidated interests in listed companies (see Note 16.1.1 to
Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements”), the value of which
fluctuates on the basis of trends in the world stock markets and/or the
position of the relevant companies.

2.5.8 Tax risk

Rule tightening by States seeking financial resources cannot be ruled
out. Changes in tax regulation, particularly harmonization between
European States, or case law relating to the application of tax rules, may

In addition, the Group holds interests in listed companies consolidated
using the equity method, including SUEZ Environnement (see Note 4 to
section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements"), for which a significant
or extended fall in the price below the value on the balance sheet is an
indication of impairment.

Risk factors
2.5 Financial risks

2.5.9 Pension funding risk

A significant portion of the Group pensions commitments and the assets
associated with these plans are concentrated in France and Belgium.
Other defined-benefit pension plans are mainly located in Europe, Brazil
and Australia.

In recent years the Group has terminated a number of defined-benefit
plans and replaced them with defined-contribution plans. The
defined-benefit plans still in operation notably include, in France, the
special electricity and gas industry (EGI) plan, which is a legal statutory
plan.

Note 19 to Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements” details the
items measured and recognized

The calculation of commitments is estimated with actuarial methods
using methods, assumptions and models to assess liabilities or
determine asset allocations and associated risks that could have a
significant impact on asset / liability levels and financing requirements.

In France, commitments within the scope of the EGI are estimated using
actuarial assumptions and rules respectively governing benefits paid out

by plans operating under common ordinary law and amounts that
remain the Group's responsibility. These assumptions and rules may be
subject to changes that increase the Group's commitments and
therefore require an increase in the relative relevant provisions.

Substantial commitments exist in the form of other post-employment
benefits and other long-term benefits for employees, in addition to
pension liabilities. These mainly comprise energy-related benefits
provided to retired employees within the scope of EGI.

Hedging levels and financing requirements for the Group's pension
plans vary according to the performance of financial markets and asset
allocations, as well as interest and inflation rates and changes in the
applicable legal and regulatory framework.

For some plans outside the scope of the EGI, ENGIE may be required to
fully or partly finance any difference between the market value of these
assets and the hedging levels projected for these plans, or any
insufficiency in the return on the assets in respect of the guaranteed
minimum average rates.
