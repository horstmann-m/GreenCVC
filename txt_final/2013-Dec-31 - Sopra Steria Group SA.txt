MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Sopra’s business and key events in 2013

This report includes the summary of the management report as well
as the Group’s financial statements.

1.1. Business in 2013 -
Background

Over the last few years, Sopra has developed a specific business
model based on Consulting, Systems Integration, Application
Outsourcing and Software Solutions Development (banking,
human resources and real estate sectors).

The Group has positioned itself and adopted a successful model
based not only on increasingly rapid technological and digital
development but also on outsourcing and business combinations.
This novel business model makes it difficult to make a comparison
with other companies within the sector which have positioned
themselves differently.

The sector saw slightly negative growth in 2013, after reporting
very weak growth in 2012. Revenue of companies in the Software
and Services sector decreased by about 0.2% in France, compared
to an increase of 0.8% in 2012 (Source: Syntec).

Sopra posted revenue of €1,349.0 million in 2013, representing
total growth of 10.9% and organic growth of 4.3%.

At 31 December 2013, the Group employed a workforce of
16,284 people, an increase of nearly 2,000 staff compared to
2012, including 1,080 net recruits and around 900 integrated
employees resulting from acquisitions.

1.2. Key events of the year

1.2.1. ACQUISITION OF HR ACCESS

Sopra’s acquisition of HR Access is in line with its strategy, which
aims not only to consolidate our positioning in the Human
Resources (HR) management market, but to attain the ambitious
objective of earning 30% of our revenue in software publishing as
well. The transaction guarantees that HR Access can continue its
activities and the possibility of contributing to the Group’s global
strategy. Sopra is able to offer a complete HR solution, perfectly
suited to the human resources market and companies of all sizes.

HR Access solutions meet the needs of public- and private-sector
companies in all industries. It has a stable client base comprised
mainly of a number of CAC 40 companies. The transaction
supplements Sopra’s solutions offerings marketed under the
Pléiades brand, widely used in the public and private sectors in
France. The solutions offered by HR Access and Sopra include
functionalities to manage personnel, skills, time, activities and
payroll. Each is available in the form of a traditional license or
outsourced service. HR Access and Sopra have a number of
strengths in common: high-quality products, proven Research
and Development capacity and in-depth knowledge of the human
resources sector.

Sopra is overseeing the continuity of product development. Clients,
whether they have chosen HR Access or Pléiades solutions, will not
see their investments compromised in any way.

HR Access has been consolidated since 1 April 2013. Over a full
year, Sopra’s HR solutions generated revenue of approximately
€100 million

compared with 8.6% in 2012. Despite persistent price pressures

in particular for fixed-price projects and application management
services, and there was a considerable rise in requests relating to
mobility, cloud services and architecture. The Group's performance

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Strategy and objectives: recent trends and outlook for 2014

and outlook for 2014

4.1. Key events in 2013

4.1.1. TARGETS COMFORTABLY ACHIEVED THANKS

TO SUSTAINED GROWTH

Sopra delivered sustained growth in 2013, enabling it to exceed
the targets set in 2012. Total Group revenue grew by 10.9% to
€1.349 billion in 2013. With organic growth of 4.3% and a margin
on operating activities of 8.1%, Sopra significantly outperformed
comparable companies, particularly in the French market, which
alone accounted for two-thirds of total revenue. The Group also
cut its debt by almost 25% in 2013.

Sopra’s workforce totalled 16,284 employees at end 2013, an
increase of 14% on 2012. This growth was the result both of net
recruitment across the Group's various sites and of employees
added to the Group via acquisitions.

4.1.2. GROWTH IN THE SOFTWARE VENDING
BUSINESS

In 2013, Sopra confirmed its status as a major vendor of business
solutions, in particular thanks to the acquisition of HR Access and
stable performance at the Sopra Banking Software subsidiary.
Solutions vending now represents a quarter of the Group’s total
revenue, split equally between France and other countries (Europe
and Rest of World).

While Sopra Banking Software alone generates two-thirds of
software vending revenue, revenue from dedicated human resources
solutions almost tripled in one year. These results are perfectly
aligned with the Sopra 2015 project, which aims in particular to
strengthen the Group’s positioning not only in software vending
but also in the human resources management market.

4.1.3. CONSOLIDATION OF THE KEY CLIENTS
PROGRAMME

Sopra continued to develop its businesses with strategic key clients
in 2013. As a result, 30 major clients in industry, finance, the public
sector, transport, retail and telecoms/media accounted for 53%
of the Group’s total revenue in 2013. This concentration strategy
continues to bear fruit and drive growth, with revenue generated
from these key accounts up 13% relative to 2012

The increase in the proportion of fixed-price projects, up from 19%
of services revenue in 2012 to 25% in 2013, together with the
reduction in technical assistance services, also demonstrates the
Group's ability to focus on major projects that deliver high added
value to clients.

Registration Document 2013 - Sopra

Strategy and objectives: recent trends

The Group also achieved growth of 18% in the public sector in
2013, driven in particular by a number of large projects in the
defence sector.

4.2. Strategic priorities in 2014

In 2014, Sopra will continue its strategic planning under what was
previously referred to as the “Sopra 2015” project, now given fresh
impetus as the “Sopra 2016” project. This project aims above all
to create value for the Group’s clients, but also its shareholders
and employees, in order to secure their engagement, thus bringing
their own long-term goals and ambitions in line with those of the
Group
This ambitious project, which has set 2015 targets for revenue
between €1.5 billion and €2 billion (with operations outside
France accounting for 35-40% of the total) and an operating
margin on business activity of around 10%, has four main strategic
thrusts:
= moving up the value chain so as to better serve the business-
related and competitiveness challenges faced by the Group’s
clients;
= expansion in Europe;

athe development of solutions able to precisely meet client
requirements;

= innovation, so as to ensure that the Group’s clients are able to
fully benefit from the opportunities offered by the latest digital
and technology advances.

4.2.1. CONFIRMING THE GROUP’S INNOVATION

AND TRANSFORMATION EFFORTS

The Group's core activity is to understand its clients’ businesses in
order to help them overcome their key challenges and boost their
competitiveness. To maintain its positioning as a preferred strategic
partner that provides its clients with a high level of added value,
supports their development and optimises their operating costs,
the Group needs to continue to focus on and invest in delivering
an offering that is both innovative and differentiating.

Growth in the digital market is characterised by an increasing
number of technological developments in the digital arena (the
cloud, big data, social networks, mobility, etc.). While these
developments give rise to tremendous opportunities for innovation
and growth, they require Sopra to be proactive and to constantly
question its business model. The Group needs to embrace emerging
technologies so that it can then advise its clients on the best way to
use those technologies to meet their needs.


--- Page 8 ---

4.2.2. STRENGTHENING THE GROUP’S POSITION
AS A SOLUTIONS VENDOR

Solution vending is a key area of development in which Sopra will
continue to invest. Within the framework of the Group’s strategic
plan, the aim is to enhance Sopra’s sector-specific offerings while
expanding its geographical coverage and ensuring the quality and
performance of the services it delivers.

Concerning human resources management solutions, one of the
projects for 2014 will be to combine HR Access and Pléiades in
order to be able to offer clients an end-to-end HR management
solution and consolidate the Group's position in this market.

4.2.3. STEPPING UP GROWTH IN THE EUROPEAN
MARKET

The Group's European subsidiaries (excluding France) grew by 9.6%
in 2013, sometimes in economically challenging markets.

In 2014, Sopra will continue to expand its European presence on
the basis of a stronger Group culture, with the aim of generating
40% of total revenue from its European subsidiaries.

4.2.4. CONTINUING WITH THE EXTERNAL GROWTH
STRATEGY

By acquiring HR Access, the Group demonstrated its ability to
integrate the offerings and expertise of external companies, not
only technically but also culturally. The most recent acquisitions
have significantly boosted overall growth and helped strengthen
Sopra’s position in its various markets.

In 2014, the Group will continue with its aggressive external
growth strategy, which will help achieve its targets in terms not
only of results but also of strategic positioning and geographical
coverage.

4.3. Recent developments

4.3.1. PROPOSED FRIENDLY TIE-UP BETWEEN SOPRA
AND STERIA TO CREATE A EUROPEAN LEADER

IN DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

On 8 April 2014, Sopra and Steria announced their intention to
create, by carrying out the proposed tie-up, a European leader in
digital services with combined revenue of €3.1bn and operations in

gave it their support.

The two firms share cultures of independence and growth and a
great deal of mutual respect, making the idea of combining forces a
natural decision. The accelerating pace of the digital revolution and
new modes of consuming services are giving rise to a deep-seated
change in the market. In this context the tie-up aims to deliver the
best transformation solutions to clients so that they can adapt to
the digital world. The alliance between Sopra and Steria would
allow the two firms to put together one of the most complete
portfolios of offerings available on the market, from software
solutions to business process execution. This industrial project
would also benefit the employees of both entities, who would be
able to evolve and acquire new skills, and shareholders, who would
be able to accompany Sopra and Steria in a foundational, value-
creating project.

Balanced corporate governance and stable reference
shareholder structure

The new group would operate with a balanced corporate
governance structure in the framework of a proposed tie-up
between equals.

Pierre Pasquier would be Chairman of its Board of Directors and
Francois Enaud would be Chief Executive Officer. On the Board
of Directors, Sopra and Steria would each be represented by four
directors, in addition to independent members and employee
representatives.

The share capital of the new combined entity would be structured,
on the one hand, around a core block representing the founders
and certain managers of Sopra, holding a total of approximately
22% of the share capital, a block owned by Geninfo representing
7% of the share capital, and finally a c.10% block owned by
former and current employees-shareholders of Steria. The above-
mentioned blocks together represent 39% of the share capital. This
shareholder structure would be materialised by a shareholders’ pact
between Sopra GMT and Soderi, with the latter representing the
former employee-shareholders of Steria.

(1) Sopra and Steria reserve the possibilty of completing the tie-up by means of a fusion statutaire merger if necessary.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Strategy and objectives: recent trends and outlook for 2014

Very strong complementary fit of business activities

and geographic segments

From an industrial perspective, the proposed tie-up between Sopra
and Steria is a response to the market changes brought about
by the digital revolution and new modes of consuming services.
The new group would be able to make the transition from a
positioning as “Systems Developer-Integrator” to “Service Creator-
Operator”, with a critical mass and the capacity to deliver the best
transformation solutions to its clients. The portfolio of offerings
would be among the most complete on the market.

The new group would generate 25% of its annual revenue from
Solutions and Business Process Services, activities with the highest
levels of growth and profitability both for Sopra and Steria. This
proportion would develop rapidly, as a result of organic and
external growth as well as the synergies related to the tie-up.

In terms of business activities and geographic segments, the
complementary fit between the two entities is very strong. Sopra
brings the power of its organisation in France, the strength of
its banking, human resources and real estate products and its
effective application management model. For its part, Steria brings
its international reach (Europe and Asia) with a strong positioning
in the United Kingdom, a pertinent offering in Business Process
Services and its expertise in IT infrastructure management.

Industrial-scale production capacity would be significantly
reinforced with an array of offshore and nearshore service centres
representing a workforce of approximately 8,000 people, including
over 6,000 in India.

A value-creating transaction drawing upon on a strong set

of synergies

Reinforcing competitive positioning and the complementary fit of
offerings and geographic locations would lead to faster revenue
growth. For example, Sopra would be able to benefit from the
European positions of Steria to accelerate the commercialisation
and rollout of its software solutions; for its part, Steria would
be able to leverage Sopra’s offshore capacity in India for its
French clients. The proposed tie-up should also generate annual
operational cost synergies of €62m commencing in 2017. The
transaction is expected to have a neutral effect on basic earnings
per share in 2015 and be strongly earnings enhancing as of 2016.
The ambition is to form a group that is capable of generating
strong organic growth with the objective of achieving revenue of
over €4bn and progressively improve the operating margin on
business activity to approach the 10% mark.

Schedule and conditions of the transaction

The Offer will be subject to the customary terms, notably to a
success threshold of at least 66.67% of the share capital and voting
rights issued by Steria.

Filing of the Offer could take place in May 2014.

Following the information-consultation of the companies’

employee-representing bodies and successful completion of the
Offer, a merger of the groups is expected to be carried out.

Registration Document 2013 - Sopra

4.3.2. CHANGES IN SOPRA'S SENIOR LEADERSHIP

In connection with the proposed friendly tie-up between Sopra
and Steria, Sopra’s Board of Directors, convened on 15 April 2014,
approved the appointment of Vincent Paris as the Group's Chief
Executive Officer, replacing Pascal Leroy. This appointment will be
effective from 1 May.

Pascal Leroy, who has served as Deputy CEO and then Chief
Executive Officer of Sopra over the last four years, will continue to
oversee the Group’s operations and functions until 30 April.

Vincent Paris, who has been Deputy CEO of Sopra since
January 2014, will be responsible for the day-to-day management
of Sopra’s operations until the effective completion of the friendly
tie-up with Steria, planned for this summer.

As announced publicly and subject to the successful completion
of the proposed tie-up, Pierre Pasquier will serve as Chairman of
the Board of Directors of the new entity, Sopra Steria Group, with
Francois Enaud as its Chief Executive Officer and Vincent Paris as
Deputy CEO.

4.3.3. ACQUISITION
OF COR&FIA BANKING SOLUTIONS GMBH

The acquisition of German company COR&FJA Banking
Solutions GmbH was announced in November 2013 and completed
in February 2014. This acquisition will boost Sopra Banking
Software's international presence and enable this subsidiary to
offer a new range of sector-specific services to a broader client
portfolio.

4.3.4. PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF THE HR ACCESS
SERVICE BUSINESS OF IBM FRANCE

On 24 April 2014, Sopra announced its intention to acquire the HR
Access Service business, which was owned until that date by IBM
France, via its subsidiary Sopra HR Software. This acquisition would
significantly increase the pace at which Sopra deploys its strategy
for human resources solutions.

The proposed acquisition, if completed, would further Sopra’s
strategic plan, which targets a strong presence in software solutions
and associated services. It would bring the Group closer to clients,
enhance its solutions oriented approach and provide recognised
expertise on the human resources market. The HR Access Service
business would join Sopra HR Software in making Sopra’s HR
solutions offering a market standard. The transaction would take
the form of a partial transfer of business (cession partielle fonds de
commerce). The acquisition price has not been made public. The
proposal has been approved by Sopra’s Board of Directors. The
transaction, subject to the usual conditions precedent including
consultation with employee representative bodies, is expected to be
finalised in July 2014. With this acquisition, the annual pro forma
revenue of Sopra’s HR solutions offerings would be approximately
€150m in 2014.

(1) At constant consolidation scope and exchange rates.

The Group posted revenue of €358.4 million for the first quarter of
2014, representing total growth of 11.5% and organic growth of
4.4%. Amid a slight market upturn, Sopra once again demonstrated
its ability to outperform

In France, business activity remained robust, continuing the trend
noted at the end of last year, with the Group turning in a solid
performance. Revenue for the quarter came to €197.8 million,
representing total growth of 3.0% and organic growth of 2.2%.
Sopra capitalized on its strong positioning among major clients,
with numerous contract signings. In addition, some of the large
contracts signed at the end of 2012 have hit their stride and are
now attaining the profitability targets set for them.

In its other European markets, the Group’s business activity also
experienced growth. Sopra posted revenue in Europe (excluding
France) of €63.8 million, achieving total growth of 6.5% and
organic growth of 5.5%. Spain and the Benelux countries had
an excellent start to the year with organic growth well over 15%,
while adverse economic conditions affecting certain projects in
Germany and Italy weighed on the Group’s performance there.
Sopra’s performance in other European markets was in line with
expectations.

Sopra Banking Software recorded revenue of €60.7 million for the
quarter, representing total growth of 14.5% and organic growth of
4.1%. The subsidiary continued to develop, in particular by building
up offshore teams in India and enhancing its industrialisation
process to handle current large-scale projects. The period saw a
significant (8%) rise in licence signings, and sales synergies with
COR&FA Banking Solutions, the Group's most recently completed
acquisition (consolidated since 1 January), began to materialise,
with the signing of the first cross-sold contract.

The Group's other solutions, for human resources and real estate,
saw strong growth. Real estate solutions posted organic growth
of more than 7%, while human resources solutions exceeded
20%. The remainder of the year is expected to offer excellent
opportunities for this business segment, which enjoys a promising
order book.

Sopra also announced the proposed acquisition, by its subsidiary
Sopra HR Software, of HR Access Service Line, currently owned by
IBM France (see press release dated 24th April). If completed, this
transaction would position Sopra even more strongly to deliver
on its software solutions strategy, expectedly resulting in pro
forma 2014 revenue of over €150 million for the Group’s Human
Resources Solutions business as a whole.

In the first quarter, 430 staff joined the Group as new hires and
115 on the acquisition of COR&FA Banking Solutions. The total
workforce now comprises 16,835 people.

Sopra maintains a 25.66% stake in its former subsidiary Axway
Software. For first quarter 2014, Axway reported an encouraging
revenue performance of €52.0 million, representing organic
growth of 6.1%. This momentum has enabled the company to
confirm its targets for the year, which include significant organic
and external growth and an operating margin on business activity
at least equal to that achieved in 2013 (15.8%).

4.3.6. CHANGE IN FINANCIAL POSITION

There has not been any significant change in the Group’s financial
or trading position since the close of the last financial year for
which audited financial statements or interim financial statements
have been published

4.4. Outlook for 2014

For the 2014 financial year Sopra is aiming for organic growth of
between 3% and 5%, as well as an improvement in its operating
margin on business activity.

If the proposed acquisition of HR Access Service comes to fruition,
the Group’s pro forma revenue will be approximately €1.5bn for
the financial year, representing total growth of approximately 11%
and the net debt target for the end of the financial year will be
between €120 million and €140 million

fl Risk factors

The procedures implemented to control and manage these risks
are presented in the Chairman of the Board of Directors’ report in
Chapter 2 of this Registration Document.

The Group carried out a review of the risks that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results
(or our capacity to achieve our objectives). We believe that we are
not exposed to any material risks other than those presented in
this Registration Document. We draw the attention of our investors
to the fact that the list of risks presented below is not exhaustive.
The Group may be exposed to unknown risks or other risks that
were not considered as of the date this Registration Document
was published and that are liable to have an adverse effect on the
Group, our business, our financial condition or the price of the
Group’s shares.

This document contains forecasts in respect of which there are
risks and uncertainties concerning the Group's future growth and
profitability. Readers are reminded that licence agreements, which
often represent investments for our clients, are generally more
significant in the second half of the year, and may therefore have a
more or less favourable impact on full-year performance.

Irrespective of the strategic risk associated with the Group's
competitive positioning and the risk that its business model
might lose its relevance, Group senior management decided,
after consulting the Executive Committee, that operational risks
associated with human resources and production constituted the
Group’s main risks, as well as risks related to business relations
with key clients and cash management. As such, these risks are the
subject of ongoing action plans.

Provisions are recognised in respect of all ongoing disputes,
as described in Notes 28 and 37 to the consolidated financial
statements, in Chapter 5 of this document.

Risks are recognised in accordance with the method presented in
Note 1.20 to the consolidated financial statements, in Chapter 5
of this document.

The Group is not aware of any legal or arbitration proceedings
which could have a significant impact other than those reflected
in the Group's financial position. As of the publication date of this
document, Sopra Group is not aware of any governmental, legal
or arbitration proceedings, including any proceedings that may be
suspended or threatened, which may have or which have had a
material impact on the Company's financial position or profitability
during the past twelve months.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Risk factors

6.1. Main operational risks

6.1.1. HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) RISKS

In a service business, which also faces certain skill shortages,
human resources risks are naturally critical. The performance of the
recruitment process, skill and career management, the permanence
of key roles and the sharing of the Group’s culture and values are
key issues deserving of constant attention.

Among the main issues involved in human resources, the optimal
use and thus the expert knowledge of the resources already present
in the Group (skills, aptitudes, potential) is an area of particular
importance, as the primary operating entities continue to grow
in size.

The organisation, tools and human resources processes contributing
to the control of this risk across the Group have been reinforced in
recent years, as described below.

The HR vision supporting the Enterprise Project over the next three
years is updated annually and broken down to individual business
unit level. With this in mind, the company’s HR requirements are
expressed in terms of headcount, changes in the Group’s business
lines and skills development requirements in line with the key
challenges faced.

Within this framework, the Group's performance measurement
and career management system aims to share employees’ specialist
knowledge and draw up individual and collective HR development
plans aligned with the company’s needs as well as with employees’
capabilities and career goals.

This system is based around the following components. Employee
performance is assessed by project managers on a_project-by-
project basis. These assessments feed into annual career interviews
with line managers. Human Resources Committees, made up of
management and all line managers in each business unit, meet
twice a year to assess and review employees’ roles, performance
and future development. In particular, they are intended to
share employees’ knowledge, assess their skills, performance and
development potential from a cross-functional perspective, and
draw up associated development plans. These Human Resources
Committees, which exist at each level of decision-making (branch,
division, country and Group), serve to ensure that performance
is assessed consistently and fairly and that career management
is aligned with the objectives embodied in the strategic HR
vision. Action plans are then rolled out and managed throughout
the year within each entity.

The Human Resources Department works with Heads of HR in each
division to support management by coordinating these various
systems.

In response to growth in operating entities, the network of line
managers within each branch, to whom branch managers may
delegate responsibility for employee career management, has been
strengthened.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Risk factors

The capacity to produce a sufficient number of leaders capable
of managing large projects which are complex in terms of their
volume, client needs, technology and production methods, such
as offshore sourcing, affects the potential long-term growth of
the Group.

An ambitious programme, which aims to favour the emergence
within the Group of its future leaders (project managers, architects,
experts, etc.) led to a rethinking of the career paths, skill use
opportunities and employment conditions of the Group's staff
employed in productive subdivisions.

Section 2, “Our responsibility to our employees”, of the Group's
Sustainable Development and Corporate Social Responsibility
Report (Chapter 4) provides an overview of the human resources
policy.

6.1.2. PRODUCTION RISKS

The main risk lies in the Group’s ability to deliver on its commitments
to clients in respect of quality, timescales and costs: to deliver
products and services in line with specifications and within the
stipulated timescales and allocated budget, particularly in the
context of major client programmes. Providing responses to fully
meet client demands and the control of production quality are
among the primary challenges faced by the Group.

Controlling such risks requires a perfect knowledge of numerous
constantly evolving technical and business environments, the
application of a prior validation procedure covering technical,
legal and financial aspects, a tried and tested project management
methodology designed to integrate the participation of Xshore
production platforms, together with a management system for
monitoring and controlling technical and accounting aspects.

On another front, the realisation of the growing importance
of issues related to the reliability of IT and communications
infrastructure led to the role of the Head of Information Systems
Security (within the Industrialisation department) being extended
This initiative meets a need to spur greater involvement among
all stakeholders across the Group in analysing risks associated
with information systems and defining action plans in a context
of growing interdependence between entities and onshore and
offshore production sites.

6.1.3. RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS RELATIONS
WITH KEY CLIENTS

Commercial efficiency depends upon the ability to mobilise all
client-related knowledge, where relationships with major clients
extend over a number of years and involve numerous employees,
often belonging to different units. Mastering this knowledge is a
key factor, which permits an understanding of, and an appropriate
response to, clients’ needs but also allows for better management
of the risk of losing a client or a major contract.

The sales approach used for major accounts is coordinated in
the form of a procedure involving the members of the Executive
Committee for the management of major commercial programmes.

Registration Document 2013 - Sopra

6.1.4. CASH MANAGEMENT RISKS

The results obtained during the last two years in promoting better
control of working capital requirements are largely attributable
to the fact that improving the management of the client cycle
remained a top priority throughout this period.

The Finance Department, which manages the provisional financing
plan, alongside the Legal Department and all operational managers
remained mobilised to improve the Group’s performance in this area.
Training efforts were pursued on behalf of managers, sales
engineers and project managers, who contribute on a day-to-day
basis to the hands-on implementation of directives in this area
Effective management of invoicing and receipts remains a high-level
priority.

In addition, organisational improvements are allowing for a better
separation of functions within the Finance Department, thus
strengthening its control of the cash cycle.

Finally, negotiated bank borrowing facilities help the Group
manage its liquidity risk.

6.2. Other risks

6.2.1. LEGAL RISKS

a. Intellectual property

Brands

Sopra and its subsidiaries have trademark protection for the main
brand names used in each country.

The brand portfolio is managed by the Group’s Legal Department
with assistance from an industrial and intellectual property advisor.

Patents

Sopra Banking Software Belgium holds patents concerning
technical algorithms used by various components (technological
and functional) of the Sopra Banking Platform software suite,
designed for banks and financial institutions.

Neither Sopra nor any of its subsidiaries have filed for or hold other
patents for software.

Software licences

Sopra and its subsidiaries own exclusive rights to all their software,
either through having developed it in-house or by having acquired
these rights.

All of the Group’s software is protected by copyright. In some
cases, copyright protection has been filed with bodies such as
Logitas.

Sopra and its subsidiaries only grant non-exclusive, non-transferable
user licences for software packages supplied to their clients.

b. Software distribution

Software developed by Sopra or by Sopra Banking Software is
usually marketed directly by the Group. The Group has nonetheless
set up a number of distribution agreements with partners.


--- Page 14 ---

c. Specific regulations

The Group is not subject to any specific regulations and its activities
are not subject to any legal, regulatory or public authorisation.

6.2.2. INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

Sopra Group operates exclusively in the field of IT services and is
therefore not exposed to any specific industrial or environmental
risk.

6.2.3. FINANCIAL RISKS

Financial risks are discussed in Note 34 to the consolidated financial
statements, in Chapter 5 of this document.

Negotiated bank borrowing facilities help the Group manage
its liquidity risk. The Group's policy concerning this matter is to
have borrowing facilities at its disposal which are much more
extensive than its needs. Sopra has entered into three syndicated
credit facilities with its banks: in the amounts of €132 million
in April 2008, €150 million in June 2011 and €128 million
in June 2012. The Group has undertaken to comply with the
covenants described in Note 36.4 to the consolidated financial
statements, in Chapter 5 of this document.

The Company has conducted a specific review of its exposure
to liquidity risk and considers that it is able to meet its future
maturities.

As of this writing, there are no elements likely to have a material
impact on Sopra’s financial position and performance.

6.2.4. RISK OF CLIENT OR SUPPLIER DEPENDENCY

a. Risk of client dependency

In 2011, our number one client accounted for 7.3% of Group
revenue; the top five clients represented 23.4% and the top ten
represented 37.4%.

In 2012, our number one client accounted for 7.4% of Group
revenue; the top five clients represented 23.4% and the top ten
represented 34.6%.

In 2013, our number one client accounted for 7.6% of Group
revenue; the top five clients represented 24.0% and the top ten
represented 35.6%.

Our main clients include BNP Paribas, CNAM/CPAM, Crédit Agricole,
Airbus Group, EDF, Orange, Mulliez-Auchan, SFR and Société Générale.

b. Risk of supplier dependency

The most significant suppliers are the travel agency, the organisation
issuing restaurant vouchers for staff members, a few sub-contractors
and the owners of premises. There are many other suppliers each
representing a low purchase amount. There is no significant risk
related to the insolvency of any of our suppliers or subcontractors.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Risk factors

6.2.5. RISKS RELATED TO THE NATURE OF CONTRACTS

The breakdown of revenue according to the nature of contracts is

summarised in the table below:

Consulting 5% 6%

% of Group's total revenue

2012

Fixed-price projects 19% 15%
Technical assistance 22% 28%
Application outsourcing 29% 30%
Industry application solutions 25% 21%
TOTAL 100% 100%

The revenue items exposed to the risk inherent in the determination
of costs are:

= 100% of fixed-price projects;

= approximately 50% of application outsourcing;

= approximately 20% of industry application solutions.

About 38% of the Group’s total revenue is exposed to the
risk inherent in the determination of costs during contractual
negotiations. For information, in recent financial years we have not

recorded any material fixed price overruns that would affect our
ability to generate margins.

6.2.6. RISKS RELATED TO DOWNTIME

Downtime is equal to the number of days between two projects
(excluding training, illness, paid leave, pre-sales, etc.) divided by
the total number of days worked by the Group’s active engineers.

This rate was approximately 5.0% in 2013 and 6.6% in 2012.

6.2.7. INSURANCE AND RISK COVERAGE

a. Civil liability insurance

Sopra has taken out liability coverage with Allianz, a policy
including business liability insurance, comprehensive general
liability insurance, products and services liability insurance and
professional liability insurance, both for the parent company and
its subsidiaries.

This policy provides worldwide cover with the exception of the
United States, Canada, North Korea and, in particular, as part of
the Group’s business in and to the entire world, with the exception
of Sudan and South Sudan, depending on the loss involved, for the
period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013

The amounts of the cover and excesses are as follows:

Business liability / Comprehensive general liability

a All-inclusive (bodily injury, property damage and financial losses,
whether consecutive or not): €40,000,000 per year covered, of
which €1,500,000 for accidental environmental damage.

= Excess: €15,000 for all damage claims except bodily damage.

company officer during
the financial year

This information is provided in Chapter 2, Section 3 of this
Registration Document.

7.2. Details of compensation
paid to company officers

The company officers occupying a position within the Group who
received fixed and variable compensation in respect of financial
year 2013 are as follows:

m= Pierre Pasquier, Chairman of the Board of Directors;
a Pascal Leroy, Chief Executive Officer.

The Chairman’s role justifies the fact that part of his compensation
is conditional upon the achievement of targets set at the beginning
of the year.

7.2.1.

b. Civil liability relating to aeronautic products

Sopra has taken out a specific insurance policy covering liability
arising from aerospace products.

c. Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance

Sopra has also contracted an insurance policy covering senior
executives’ liability.

Information concerning company officers

Like all Executive Committee members, company officers holding a
position within the Group received variable compensation in 2013
based on 2012 results and receive such compensation in 2014
based on 2013 results. This variable component may represent up
to:

= 40% of fixed annual compensation where the Group’s profitability

target as well as individual targets are met;

= 60% of fixed annual compensation for very strong performance.
As a result of the alignment of the variable remuneration system
applicable to executive company officers with that of all Executive
Committee members, the Group departs from the recommendations
of the AFEP-MEDEF Code of corporate governance, which states
that “when qualitative criteria are used, a limit must be determined
for the qualitative portion”. For the Group, qualitative criteria do
not entitle the beneficiary to receive variable remuneration but
serve instead to determine the upward or downward adjustment
in the amount calculated in respect of the main profitability target
shared by all senior executives and Executive Committee members.
Due to the fact that these targets are not announced publicly, they
may be determined without giving consideration to any factors
other than the interests of the Group.

No further options may be granted under Plan 5, Plan 6, or Plan 7.
At the Combined General Meeting held on 19 June 2012, the
shareholders authorised the Board of Directors to issue options
under Plan 8. No shares have yet been allotted under this plan.

Adjustments were made to the exercise price and volume of Sopra
share subscription options yet to be exercised as at 14 June 2011
to reflect the Axway spin-off and capital increase with pre-emptive
rights for existing shareholders. These adjustments are set out in

the table above.

Registration Document 2013 - Sopra

Based on these adjustments, the number of Sopra shares issuable
against outstanding options is 178,084.
On 19 June 2012, the General Meeting set a limit of 5% of the
share capital for the issue of new shares against subscription
options provided for under Plan 8, with the qualification that the
issue of any subscription and/or purchase warrants for redeemable
shares (BSAAR), as well as any bonus share issues, would result in
this limit being lowered such that the total value of the securities

issued would not exceed 5% of the share capital.


--- Page 20 ---

In light of the 166,875 bonus shares issued under the plan
authorised by the General Meeting of 19 June 2012 (see Note 25.3
of Chapter 5 of this document), the number of options that could
still be issued as of 31 December 2013 under Plan 8 was 427,799.
This in turn brings the maximum number of Sopra shares to be
issued in respect of options to be exercised to 605,883.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Information concerning company officers

On exercising their options, holders of Sopra options as at
14 June 2011 are eligible to receive one free Axway Software share
held by the Company for each Sopra option originally granted. The

* By way of exception to AFEP-MEDEF guidelines, given his seniority in the Group, Pascal Leroy’s employment contract was not terminated when he was named Chief Executive Officer.

The contract remains in suspension as of his appointment to the position of Deputy CEO on 29 October 2010.
** On 17 October 2012 the Board of Directors voted, on recommendation from the Compensation Committee, to grant Pascal Leroy a guarantee. This guarantee would be triggered

only if his company officer status and his employment contract were to be terminated simultaneously, on the Company's initiative, except in the event of gross negligence, wilful

misconduct, or compulsory retirement. The target amount of this guarantee will be equal to Pascal Leroy's average variable compensation, assuming fulfilment of targets, over the

two financial years immediately preceding the termination of his company officer status. The amount effectively paid will be determined by multiplying the target amount by his

average level of performance over the preceding two financial years. His average level of performance is defined as the ratio of his average variable compensation effectively paid

over the preceding two financial years to his average variable compensation assuming fulfilment of targets. Thus, the payment of the guarantee is conditional upon the fulfilment,

and prior recognition thereof by the Board of Directors, of the performance criteria agreed on as a basis for releasing variable compensation during the benchmark period. Moreover,

the amount of the guarantee will be strictly proportional to the performance assessment validated by the Board of Directors.
Pursuant to the provisions of the French Commercial Code, this guarantee was submitted for approval by the General Meeting of 13 June 2013 (fifth resolution).
