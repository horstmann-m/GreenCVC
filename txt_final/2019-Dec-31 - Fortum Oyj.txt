Taxes for the period totalled EUR 221 (181) million. The effective
income tax rate, according to the income statement, was 12.8% (17.5%).
The comparable effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of the

comparison period in 2018 included the acquisition of Uniper shares.
Capital expenditure increased by EUR 116 million to EUR 695 (579)
million. Cash collaterals and restricted cash decreased by EUR 347
milion, including the non-cash collateral arrangement in the first quarter

major positive impact of EUR 310 million. Consequently, cash flow before
financing activities increased significantly to EUR 1,646 (-3,594) million.

Proceeds from long-term liabilities were EUR 2,805 (1,764) million,
arising from the issuance of new bonds totalling EUR 2.5 billion under the

300 million. The proceeds from the issued bonds were used to repay the
bridge financing of EUR 1,750 million related to the acquisition of Uniper
shares in 2018 and repayment of a bond of EUR 750 million. The total
payments of long-term liabilities were EUR 2,567 (586) million. The net
increase in liquid funds was EUR 806 (-3,268) million.

dividends received from Uniper EUR 165 (-) million, Stockholm Exergi EUR
40 (39) million, Turun Seudun Energiantuotanto EUR 20 (10) million, and
TGC-1 EUR 10 (7) million.

At the end of 2019, total assets amounted to EUR 23,364 (22,409)
million. Liquid funds at the end of the period increased to EUR 1,433

(11,841) million. The dividend of EUR 1.10 per share for 2018 was
approved by the 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 26 March 2019
and paid on 4 April 2019. The increase in equity of EUR 1,141 million
was mainly related to the net profit for the period of EUR 1,482 million,
the positive impact from fair valuation of cash flow hedges of EUR 561
million, and the positive translation differences of EUR 253 million, partly
offset by the dividend payment of EUR 977 million.

Financing

Net debt decreased by EUR 249 million to EUR 5,260 (5,509) million,
including lease liabilities of EUR 114 million. interest-bearing liabilities
increased by EUR 601 million and liquid funds increased by EUR 851
million. The dividend, EUR 977 million, was paid on 4 April 2019.

At the end of 2019, the Group's liquid funds (including cash balances
of EUR 2 million relating to assets held for sale) totalled EUR 1,435 (584)
million. Liquid funds include cash and bank deposits held by PAO Fortum
of EUR 201 (317) million. At the end of 2019, Fortum had undrawn
committed credit facilities amounting to EUR 1,800 (1,800) million, of
which EUR 1,750 million is maturing in June 2023. In the fourth quarter of
2019, Fortum signed additional committed credit facilities of EUR 8,300
million for the acquisition of Uniper shares as announced on 8 October
2019 (> Note 24). On 7 January 2020, Fortum cancelled EUR 3,000
million of these new committed credit facilities.

On 19 February 2019, Fortum issued bonds with a total nominal value
of EUR 2,500 million under its EMTN programme. The bonds were issued
in three tranches with the following maturities; EUR 1,000 million with
a 0.875% fixed coupon maturing on 27 February 2023; EUR 750 million
with a 1.625% fixed coupon maturing on 27 February 2026; and EUR
750 million with a 2.125% fixed coupon maturing on 27 February 2029.

The proceeds from the issued bonds were used to repay the bridge financing of EUR 1,750 million related to the
acquisition of the initial 49.99% stake in Uniper in 2018 and repayment of a 6% fixed-coupon bond of EUR 750
million, which resulted in a more balanced debt maturity profile. In April 2019, Fortum drew a five-year EUR 300
million bilateral financial loan.

Following Fortum’s announcement to acquire an additional stake of more than 20.5% of Uniper’s shares,
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch reviewed the credit rating of Fortum. In October 2019, Standard & Poor's placed
Fortum's long-term credit rating of BBB on CreditWatch Negative. The short-term rating is at level A-2. In October
2019, Fitch Ratings placed Fortum’s long-term credit rating of BBB and short-term credit rating of F2 on Ratin:
Watch Negative. Both rating agencies are expected to update the credit ratings after the closing of the acquisition
of at least an additional 20.5% of Uniper shares. Standard & Poor's have announced that they will likely consolidate
Uniper into Fortum and link the issuer credit rating on Uniper to that of Fortum upon antitrust approval.

Fortum's key objective is to have a solid investment-grade rating of at least BBB, in order to preserve financial
flexibility and good access to capital markets post-closing of the above-mentioned acquisition of Uniper shares,
and to strengthen its financial profile longer term. This will provide appropriate financial stability and support to
the enlarged group.

The comparable net debt-to-EBITDA ratio for 2019 was 3.0x (3.6x). The target is to steer the leverage from

the current net debt-to-EBITDA ratio towards the long-term over-the-cycle target of approximately 2.5x. When
adjusting net debt with the impact of the divestment of the Joensuu district heating business and the announced
sale of a 80% share of our Nordic wind portfolio, Fortum’s long-term target of around 2.5x was achieved.

Gearing was 40% (46%) and the equity-to-assets ratio was 57% (54%). Equity per share was EUR 14.61 (13.33).
Return on capital employed (ROCE) for 2019 was 10.0% (6.7%). Fortum targets a long-term over-the-cycle return
on capital employed of at least 10%.

Fortum’s key financial targets will be revisited in due course to ensure alignment with a commitment to retain a
solid investment grade rating of at least BBB.

Operating and regulatory environment

Nordic countries

According to preliminary statistics, electricity consumption in the Nordic countries was 392 (399) TWh, as milder
weather during the first quarter and slightly lower industrial demand caused a slight decrease in the power
demand.

At the beginning of 2019, the Nordic water reservoirs were at 74 TWh, which is 10 TWh lower than the long-
term average and 8 TWh lower than one year earlier. At the end of the year, the reservoirs were at 79 TWh, which
is 5 TWh below the long-term average and 5 TWh higher than one year earlier. In April 2019, the Norwegian
energy regulator (NVE) revised the Norwegian reservoir statistics. The reported reference levels and historical
deviations have been updated accordingly.

Financial performance and position

Regulatory environment

New EU institutions with a strong focus on climate
Following the EU elections in May, the new Parliament took office. The
Commission headed by President Ursula von der Leyen started at the
beginning of December and, without delay, issued the first outline of its
Green Deal.

The European Council, except Poland, endorsed the target of reaching
EU economy-wide climate neutrality by 2050. Meanwhile, the Commission
announced its intention to triple the budget of the Just Transition Fund
to EUR 100 billion, with the target to ease the transformation in heavily
fossil-reliant countries. Polish adherence will be reconsidered in the
European Council in June 2020, whilst the 2050 EU economy-wide target
will be part of the Climate Law due in February 2020.

Fortum welcomes the firm climate orientation of the new EU
institutions.

The European Green Deal emerging

In December, the European Commission published a Communication on
the European Green Deal. It will be the new Commission's bold political
initiative, aiming at EU economy-wide climate neutrality by 2050. The
Commission is expected to launch up to 50 related initiatives during the
next two years.

While, the Green Deal will not be solely about climate ambition, it is
expected to deliver extensive growth for Europe bundling all EU policy
areas and all sectors of society. The Green Deal comprises, among other
things, energy supply, circular economy, ecosystems, biodiversity, and
mainstreaming of sustainability in all EU policies.

Practically all energy and climate targets and policies will be subject to
revision, and consequently, entail a regulatory risk. The Commission will
present a Green Financing Strategy in autumn 2020 in order to enable
the private sector to contribute to the financing of a green transition.

Fortum welcomes the Green Deal and considers sector integration and
electrification as offering significant solutions and business opportunities
to meet the ambitious goals of the Green Deal.

Sustainable finance regulation adopted

In December, the European Council and Parliament reached an
agreement on the taxonomy regulation of sustainable finance. The
taxonomy creates a unified classification system for what can be
considered sustainable investments. The regulation still needs to be
formally approved by the Council and Parliament and is expected to
enter into force by the end of 2022.

The regulation strongly leans towards renewable energy technologies.
Nuclear and gas may qualify as ‘transitional activities’, depending on the
‘outcome of the assessment that will be carried out by the Commission
during 2020. The status of waste-to-energy is still open whilst the
treatment of hazardous waste has been classified as sustainable.

As such, the objective of the sustainable finance initiative is in line with
Fortum's strategy. Fortum has, however, strongly advocated for an approach
based on CO, emissions and technology-neutrality in compliance with the
Paris Agreement. There is a risk that if the taxonomy discriminates against
some low-carbon technologies, the financing costs of such investments will
increase in the future and result in unduly expensive decarbonisation.

EIB’s new energy lending policy approved
In November, the European Investment Bank (EIB) agreed on a new
energy lending policy and confirmed the EIB’s increased ambition in
climate action and environmental sustainability. EIB will align all financing
activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement from the end of 2020
and end financing for fossil fuel energy projects from the end of 2021.
The Sustainable Europe Investment Plan launched by the new
Commission targets to unlock EUR 1 trillion of climate action and
environmentally sustainable investments by 2030. The EIB will play a key
role in this and will gradually turn into a climate bank. EIB will no longer
consider new financing for fossil fuel energy projects, including gas. In
addition, EIB set a new Emissions Performance Standard of 250g of CO;/
kWh for power and heat projects. This will replace the current 550g of
CO./kWh standard. Nuclear and renewable energy projects continue to
be eligible for funding. If in line with the EU waste hierarchy and national
waste management plans, waste-to-energy projects are also eligible.
The new EIB lending policy is well in line with Fortum’s strategy.

German climate and coal phase-out legislation

In September 2019, the German Government released an extensive
climate and energy package in order to meet the 2030 emission
reduction target of 55% and carbon-neutrality by 2050. In December, the
German Parliament approved the climate package. The package includes
a national emissions trading system for the transport and building sectors
with carbon prices of EUR 25 in 2021 and EUR 55 in 2025. To offset

the higher costs for consumers and companies, the climate package
includes subsidies for electric cars and tax incentives for greener heating,
electricity, and housing.

The climate protection law ("Klimaschutzgesetz") sets annual COz
emission reduction targets for the period 2020-2030 for six sectors:
energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, waste management,
and others.

In addition, the Government decided on a coal phase-out plan, based
on the earlier proposal and is committed to propose legislation in line
with the recommendations of the Coal Commission, and to publish a
gas strategy including hydrogen. The coal phase-out legislation was
approved by the federal cabinet on 29 January 2020 and is expected
to be completed in the first half of 2020. In the years 2026 and 2029,
the Government plans to carry out large-scale reviews of how the coal
phaseout is progressing. The review will inform the decision on whether
the phase-out can be brought forward by three years, i.e. that Germany
could phase out coal as early as 2035. With regards to the new coal-fired
plant Datteln 4, owned by Uniper, the Government announced its interest
to allow the commissioning of the plant while, at the same time, old and
less-efficient plants would be closed.

In Fortum’s opinion, it would be essential to have the respective
legislation become effective as soon as possible, as the first auctions for
the closure of hard coal plants are planned already for summer 2020 and
the first plants are to be closed in 2022.

Changed Swedish taxation resulted in new CHP and waste-
to-energy taxes

In line with a broad political agreement made in January 2019, containing
new taxes of up to EUR 1.5 billion, legislation on the taxation of waste

incineration was approved by the Swedish Government on 4 December Segment reviews Generation

2019. The tax level was set at SEK 75/tonne in 2020 and will increase to
SEK 125/tonne by 2022.

As part of the tax change, the Government also passed a law to
increase the tax for fossil-fuelled CHP plants, effective from August 2019.
The Government has not specified the definition of a green tax, and
additional taxes are likely to be presented during the spring of 2020.

Swedish energy agreement collapses

In December, the Conservatives and Christian Democrats left the Swedish
broad energy agreement made in 2016. The main reason was the
‘ongoing disagreement on nuclear power, with the opposition wanting to
update the agreement with more nuclear friendly wording. The collapse
of the agreement will not have any major financial implications for Fortum
as key elements in the original agreement, mainly tax reductions for
hydro and nuclear power, have already been implemented. However, it
will most likely result in increasing regulatory uncertainty, especially for
nuclear power.

Business model

Fortum’s business activities cover the production and sales of electricity
and heat, waste-to-energy and circular economy solutions, as well as
energy-sector expert services and various consumer solutions. Fortum
is the third largest power generator and the largest electricity retailer in
the Nordic countries. Globally, the company is one of the leading heat
producers. As two thirds of Fortum's power production is hydro and
nuclear, the company is also among the lowest-emitting generators in
Europe.

With core operations in 10 countries, Fortum employs a diverse team
of more than 8,000 energy-sector professionals. Fortum has some 130
hydro power plants, 26 combined heat and power (CHP), condensing,
and nuclear power plants, as well as four wind power parks and four solar
power plants. Globally, the company supplies heat in 24 cities and towns
and has five waste-to-energy plants. Fortum’s key markets are the Nordic
and Baltic countries, Russia, Poland, and India.

Fortum's business divisions are Generation, City Solutions, Consumer
Solutions and Russia. Other Operations includes corporate functions, R&D
and technology development projects, as well as Fortum’s shareholding
in Uniper SE.

In November 2018, Fortum announced that the solar and wind
businesses were reorganised and the wind operations became a business
area within the Generation segment and the solar operations within
the City Solutions segment. Previously these were included in Other
Operations. The Russian wind and solar operations continue as a part of
the Russia segment. Fortum has restated its 2018 comparative segment
reporting figures in accordance with the new organisation structure.

Generation is responsible for Nordic power production. The segment
comprises nuclear, hydro, wind, and thermal power production, as well as
power portfolio optimisation, trading, industrial intelligence, and global
nuclear services.

1) The Nordic power sales income and volume includes hydro, wind, and nuclear generation,
excluding minorities. It does not include thermal generation, minorities, customer business
or other purchases.

2) Power plants are often built jointly with other power producers, and owners purchase
electricity at cost including interest cost and production taxes. The share of profit/loss
is mainly IFRS adjustments (e.g. accounting for nuclear-related assets and liabilities) and
depreciations on fair-value adjustments from historical acquisitions (» Note 19).

The Generation segment's total power generation in the Nordic countries
increased due to higher hydro and nuclear volumes. The hydro volumes
in the comparison period were low mainly due to the historically low
levels in the third quarter of 2018. The segment’s overall operational
performance and the load factor for nuclear generation were at a good
level. The nuclear load factor for the Fortum fleet and partly owned
companies was at the highest level in Fortum’s history with the Loviisa 1
power plant setting a new production record. The CO,-free production
accounted for 100% (100%) of the total power generation.

The achieved power price in the Generation segment increased by
EUR 2.2 per MWh, +6%, driven by higher hedge prices and successful
optimisation of hydropower production, as well as higher first-quarter
spot power prices.

Comparable operating profit increased by 26%, mainly due to higher
hydro and nuclear volumes and the higher achieved power price.

Operating profit was affected by EUR -23 (108) million of items
affecting comparability, mainly related to the fair value change of non-
hedge-accounted derivatives. In the third quarter of 2018, Fortum
recorded a capital gain of EUR 77 million from the sale of the 10% stake
in Hafslund Produksjon () Note 6).

The share of profits of associated companies and joint ventures
totalled EUR 10 (-72) million (> Note 49).

The annual outages of the Loviisa nuclear power plant were managed
well. The maintenance outages at Unit 1 and Unit 2 lasted 20 days and
26 days, respectively. Both units underwent a refuelling outage, during
which approximately one quarter of the fuel was replaced.

In June 2019, Posiva decided to start construction of the
encapsulation plant for spent nuclear fuel and start equipping the Onkalo
final depository with systems needed for the final disposal. The start
of the final disposal will still require licences to operate. In September
2019, the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel took a step forward, as the
foundation stone for Posiva’s encapsulation plant was laid at Onkalo, in
Eurajoki, Finland. Posiva will dispose of the high-level nuclear waste of
its owners, Fortum Power and Heat Oy (share of ownership 40%) and
Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) (share of ownership 60%).

In December 2019, 440 MW of the production capacity of Fortum's
Meri-Pori power plant was selected for inclusion in the Finnish national
peak-load reserve capacity system from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2022.

Heat sales volumes were at the same level as in the previous year. Power
sales volumes increased, mainly due to higher power volumes in the new

Comparable operating profit decreased by 10%. The main reason for
the decline was the profit of EUR 26 million recorded in the third quarter of
2018 from the sale of a 54% share of Fortum’s Indian solar portfolio, partly
offset by the positive impact of one-time effects in the fourth quarter of
2019 and the strong result improvement during the year in the Norwegian
heating and cooling business. The full-year comparable operating profit

previous year. The cost synergies related to the Hafslund transaction
materialised gradually during 2019, with targeted annual synergies of EUR
5-10 million expected to be achieved by the end of 2020.

Operating profit was affected by EUR 7 (-5) million of items affecting
comparability, mainly related to capital gains and the fair value change of
non-hedge-accounted derivatives (» Note 6).

The share of profits of associated companies and joint ventures
totalled EUR 37 (74) million, the main part of which was related to the
share of profit of Stockholm Exergi, EUR 24 (61) million and Turun Seudun
Energiantuotanto EUR 13 (13) million (» Note 19).

In September 2019, Fortum announced, in line with Fortum’s strategy
and the target to achieve carbon-neutral district heating in Espoo during
the 2020's, the intention to discontinue the use of coal in the Espoo district
heating network by the end of 2025.

In December 2019, the Swedish Government decided to implement new
taxes on fossil fuels used for heat production in CHP plants, taking effect
from August 2019. Consequently, during 2019, the board of Stockholm
Exergi decided to decommission the last coal-fired unit in Stockholm,
CHP6, starting from the end of the 2019-2020 heating season. Fortum’s
share of profits from Stockholm Exergi was impacted by EUR -22 million
related to the impairment booked in Stockholm Exergi’s fourth-quarter
2019 results.

On 20 December 2019, Fortum signed an agreement to sell its district
heating business in Joensuu, Finland, to Savon Voima Oyj. The total
consideration on a debt- and cash-free basis was approximately EUR 530
million, and the cash was received at the completion of the divestment
on 40 January 2020. Fortum will record a tax-exempt capital gain of
approximately EUR 430 million in the City Solutions segment's first-quarter
2020 results.

The electricity sales volumes increased by 1%, mainly due to increased
sales to business customers, partly offset by the impact of the warmer
weather in the first and fourth quarters and the reduced number of
customers. The decrease in the number of customers was the result of a
more selective customer acquisition and retention approach. Throughout
the year, the market sentiment in the Nordics continued to be challenging
with tough competition and high customer churn. However, during the
integration and restructuring of Hafslund, Fortum has been able to improve
its competitive position in the Nordics. Higher market prices, especially in
the first quarter, was the main driver for the 5% increase in sales.

Comparable operating profit increased by 49%, mainly supported by
higher sales margins. The higher sales margins are a result of the active
development of the product and service portfolios following the Hafslund
integration and subsequent development of the business. Part of the
improvement was related to favourable market conditions in the first
half of the year, temporarily increasing profitability in certain areas of the
customer portfolio. The annual EUR 10 million cost synergies related to
the Hafslund transaction, projected to materialise by the end of 2020,
fully materialised already during 2019.

Operating profit was affected by EUR -59 (22) million of items
affecting comparability, due to the fair value change of non-hedge-

to the Yustek joint venture. The warmer weather in both the Chelyabinsk
and Tyumen areas also had a negative impact.

Sales remained stable. The negative effect of the transfer of the heat
distribution business in Chelyabinsk to the Yustek joint venture, and lower
heat volumes due to the warmer weather in Chelyabinsk and Tyumen
were offset by higher electricity prices, higher CSA payments at Nyagan
2, and the stronger Russian rouble.

Comparable operating profit increased by 17%, supported by higher
electricity margins, lower bad-debt provisions, and higher received
CSA payments. The increase in CSA payments was related to Nyagan 2
receiving higher payments for the last years of the CSA period starting
from the third quarter of 2018. The effect of the change in the Russian
rouble exchange rate was EUR 4 million.

The share of profits of associated companies and joint ventures

Other Operations

Other Operations comprises corporate functions, technology and

shareholding in Uniper, which is consolidated as an associated company
from 30 June 2018 (> Note 3).

Uniper investment and purchase price allocation

In 2017, Fortum announced a public takeover offer to buy shares in
Uniper. In June 2018, the offer was settled and Fortum’s ownership
was 47.12%. At the end of 2018, Fortum’s ownership in Uniper was
49.99%. The total acquisition cost for the initial 49.99% stake in Uniper
of EUR 3,968 million, including direct costs relating to the acquisition, is
reported in 'Participations in associated companies and joint ventures’.
The purchase price allocation was finalised during the second quarter
of 2019. Uniper's balance sheet as of 30 June 2018 has been used

as the starting point for the purchase price allocation; however, a fair
value adjustment of EUR 613 million has been made for the acquired
assets and liabilities. Fortum's share of the goodwill on Uniper's balance
sheet, EUR 930 million, is derecognised, as it is not an identifiable asset
according to IFRS. Potential future impairments of goodwill (existing

as of 30 June 2018) booked by Uniper will therefore be reversed to

Fortum's share of profits of associates and joint ventures. The fair value
adjustments of EUR 613 million relates mainly to political and regulatory
risks that are reflected in the fair value of certain generation and
production assets. The fair value adjustment will be reversed to ‘Share
of profits of associates and joint ventures’ over a period of 20 years,
EUR 31 million annually. If Uniper reports negative impacts relating to
these generation and production assets, Fortum will assess the potential
need to use this fair value adjustment to reverse the negative impacts
(> Note 3).

In May 2019, Uniper hosted its AGM. The AGM approved the
proposed dividend of EUR 0.90 per share, which, for Fortum, corresponds
to received dividends of EUR 165 million.

On 8 October 2019, Fortum announced it had entered into
agreements with Elliott and Knight Vinke to acquire an additional stake
of at least 20.5% in Uniper for approximately EUR 2.3 billion, increasing
Fortum’s share in Uniper to more than 70.5% (subject to regulatory
clearances) and the total investment in Uniper to approximately EUR 6.2
billion, representing an average acquisition price of EUR 23.97 per share
(> Notes 3 and 19).

In 2048, in connection with the acquisition of the initial stake of
49.99% in Uniper, Fortum already received unconditional merger
clearance from the European Commission with no further clearance
required in the EU for any further acquisitions. On 30 December
2019, Fortum received regulatory clearance in the United States for
the transaction. On 14 November 2019, the Russian Government
Commission for Monitoring Foreign Investments approved, subject to
certain conditions, the closing of the acquisition. The clarification of these
conditions is still ongoing. Closing of the transactions is still subject to
customary merger control clearance in Russia, and is expected by the
end of the first quarter of 2020.

Fortum will fully consolidate Uniper as a subsidiary in its financial
statements from closing of the transaction. The transaction will be

financed with existing cash resources and committed credit facilities,
that were syndicated to 13 banks in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Fortum's key objective is to have a solid investment-grade rating of at
least BBB, in order to preserve financial flexibility and good access to
capital markets post-closing of the acquisition of an additional stake of
at least 20.5% in Uniper, and to strengthen its financial profile longer
term. This will provide the appropriate financial stability and support for
the enlarged group. As Uniper publishes its interim reports later than
Fortum, Fortum's share of Uniper's results is accounted for with a time
lag of one quarter, with potential adjustments. Fortum's 2019 Financial
Statements include Fortum's share of Uniper’s October-December 2018
and January-September 2019 results (> Note 3). Uniper will report its full
year 2019 results on 10 March 2020 and its first-quarter 2020 results on
7 May 2020.

On 30 January 2020, Uniper announced an ambitious phase-out plan
for its German hard-coal-fired power production. The company plans to
shut down a total of 1500 MW of hard-coal capacity by the end of 2022
and a further 1,400 MW by the end of 2025. The last remaining hard-
coal-fired power plant would be the 1,100-MW Datteln 4 power plant
that must be decommissioned in 2038, at the latest, according to the
draft law on coal phase-outs in Germany.

Financial results of Other Operations

Comparable operating profit declined, mainly as a result of the increased
spend in Business Technology, including internal and external ventures.
The investments in Valo Ventures and the related costs totalled EUR 23
million.

The share of profits of associated companies and joint ventures
totalled EUR 638 (0) million (> Note 19). Fortum’s share of Uniper's profits
EUR 632 (-2) million, comprises Uniper’s October-December 2018 and
January-September 2019 results and the impact from reinstatement of
the UK capacity market in the fourth quarter 2019, totalling EUR 601 (-2)

3) Separate investment decision needed.

Generation

Through its interest in TVO, Fortum is participating in the building of
Olkiluoto 3 (OL3), a 1,600-MW nuclear power plant unit in Finland. OL3
is funded through external loans, share issues, and shareholder loans
according to shareholder agreements between the owners and TVO. As
a 25% shareholder in OL3, Fortum has committed to pro rata funding of
the project. At the end of the reporting period, Fortum's outstanding loan
receivables related to OL3 were EUR 170 million and the outstanding
commitment was EUR 63 million. In March 2019, the Finnish Government

granted an operating licence for OL3. According to the time schedule
updated by plant supplier Areva-Siemens consortium in December
2019, the plant will start regular electricity generation in March 2021
(> Note 37).

In December 2019, Fortum and Credit Suisse Energy Infrastructure
Partners (CSEIP) signed an agreement whereby funds advised by CSEIP
will acquire an 80% stake in Fortum’s Nordic wind portfolio. Fortum
will continue to manage the construction and serve as long-term asset
manager for the wind portfolio. The portfolio consists of the operational
Nygrdsfjellet (32 MW, Norway), Anstadblaheia (50 MW, Norway), and
Solberg (76 MW, Sweden) wind parks as well as the Kalax (90 MW,
Finland) wind park, which is under construction. The parties have also
agreed that funds advised by CSEIP will invest in an 80% share of the
Sorfjord (97 MW, Norway) wind park, once it is fully commissioned.
Part of the capacities are already operational and the remaining part is
expected to be commissioned by the end of the third quarter of 2020.
In addition, Fortum and CSEIP have agreed on further cooperation
and exclusivity on a new project in Savar, Sweden (154 MW) with
the ambition to build it at a later stage. The total consideration of the
divestment of the 80% stake on a debt- and cash-free basis is expected
to be approximately EUR 250 million, of which EUR 170 million is related
to the first quarter of 2020. The transaction is subject to regulatory
approvals in the EU and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
The sale will have a minor positive effect on the Generation segment’s
first-quarter 2020 comparable operating profit.

In May 2019, Fortum announced the restructuring of Fortum’s and
Skelleftea Kraft’s ownership in the two jointly owned Swedish wind
parks Solberg and Blaiken. Through an asset swap arrangement, Fortum
became the sole owner of the 76-MW Solberg wind park and Skellefted
Kraft the sole owner of the 248-MW Blaiken wind park. The Solberg-
acquisition related to the Solberg-Blaiken asset swap amounted to EUR
36 million. The asset swap arrangement was finalised in August 2019 and
had a minor impact on Fortum’s cash flow and results.

Financial performance and position

In May 2019, Fortum made the investment decision to start
construction of the 90-MW Kalax wind park in Narpes, Finland. The
capital expenditure of the wind park is approximately EUR 90 million. The
wind park is expected to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2021
at the latest. In October 2019, Fortum signed a 12-year power purchase
agreement selling 70% of the power production of the Kalax wind park to
Neste Corporation.

In January 2019, Fortum acquired all remaining C-shares of TVO,
entitling it to 100% of the power production of the Meri-Pori coal
condensing power plant, an increase from 67% previously. In December,
440 MW of the production capacity of Fortum’s Meri-Pori power plant
was selected for inclusion in the Finnish national peak-load reserve
capacity system from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2022.

City Solutions
In December 2019, Fortum signed an agreement to sell its district heating
business in Joensuu, Finland to Savon Voima Oyj. The total consideration
ona debt- and cash-free basis was approximately EUR 530 million. The
transaction was completed on 10 January 2020 and Fortum will record
a tax exempt capital gain of approximately EUR 430 million in the City
Solutions segment's first-quarter 2020 results. In June 2019, Fortum
announced it would review and consider strategic options for the Joensuu
and Estonian district heating businesses. The strategic review of the
Estonian district heating business is still ongoing. An extended assessment
that includes the district heating and cooling businesses in all
Baltic countries, in Poland, and in Jarvenpaa, Finland, is also being initiated.

In May 2019, Fortum announced its plan to construct a new 20-MW.
heat pump unit at the Suomenoja power plant in Espoo, Finland, to
produce carbon-neutral district heating and to replace fossil fuel-based
heat production. The unit is planned for commissioning in spring 2021
and will, together with the Kivenlahti bio-HOB, increase the share of
Espoo's carbon-neutral district heating production in 2022 to over 50%.
The final investment decision to build the unit was made in the fourth
quarter of 2019.

In March 2019, Fortum announced that it had won the right from
Solar Energy Corporation of India to build a 250-MW solar power plant

in Rajasthan, India. Commissioning of the plant is expected in the fourth
quarter of 2020.

In June 2018, Fortum won the right to build a 250-MW solar power
plant in the Pavagada solar park in Karnataka, India. The capital
expenditure was approximately EUR 160 million. The plant was fully
commissioned by 5 August 2019.

In June 2018, Fortum signed an agreement to sell a 54% share of its
solar power company operating four solar power plants in India to UK
Climate Investments (40%) and Elite Alfred Berg (14%). In April 2019, Elite
Alfred Berg used its option to buy an additional 2% from Fortum.

In 2015, Fortum decided to build a new multi-fuel CHP plant in Zabrze,
Poland. The new plant is primarily fuelled by refuse-derived fuel (RDF)
and coal; however, it is also able to use a mixture of fuels. The new plant
has a production capacity of 145 MW of heat and 75 MW of electricity
and replaces the existing purely coal-fired units in Zabrze and Bytom.
Commissioning was somewhat delayed from the original plan and
commercial operations started on 1 April 2019.

Russia
In April 2019, the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation selected
Fortum and Energy Sales Company Vostok's 50/50 joint venture as
the guaranteed electricity retail supplier to 1.5 million customers in the
Chelyabinsk region as of 1 July 2019. The decision was made based
‘on an auctioning process held in March 2019. In the auction, the joint
venture committed to a 100% reimbursement of the RUB 4.8 billion debt
of Chelyabenergosbyt, corresponding to approximately EUR 66 million.
The transaction required a limited equity investment from Fortum, as the
joint venture financed the major part of the reimbursement with external
debt. For Fortum, the net impact of the reimbursement was substantially
lower due to the fact that Fortum was the single largest creditor, with
EUR 11 million of the debt.
In June 2019, Fortum won the right to build 5.6 MW of solar capacity
in Russian CSA auctions, in addition to the 110 MW won in June 2018.
The power plants are to be commissioned during the years 2021-2022.
In June 2018, the Fortum-Rusnano wind investment fund (50/50
joint venture) won the right to build 823 MW of wind capacity in a CSA

auction. The wind parks were to be commissioned during the years
2019-2023. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the wind investment fund
made an investment decision on a 100-MW wind farm. Power production
and capacity supply is expected to start during the first half of 2020.

In June 2017, the Fortum-Rusnano wind investment fund won the
right to build 1,000 MW of wind capacity in a CSA auction. The wind
parks were to be commissioned during the years 2018-2022. In the
fourth quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019, the wind investment fund made
investment decisions on a 50-MW, a 200-MW, and a 250-MW wind
farm, respectively. On 1 January 2019, the 50-MW wind farm started
operation. Power production and capacity supply at the 200-MW wind
farm is expected to start during the first half of 2020 and at the 250-
MW wind farm during the fourth quarter of 2020.

The investment decisions related to the renewable capacities won by
Fortum and the Fortum-Rusnano wind investment fund in 2017, 2018,
and 2019 are made on a case-by-case basis. Fortum’s maximum equity
commitment is RUB 15 billion. In the longer term, Fortum seeks to
maintain an asset-light structure.

Research and development
Sustainability is at the core of Fortum’s strategy and, alongside Fortum’s
current businesses, the company is carefully exploring and developing
new sources of growth within renewable energy production.

Fortum's goal is to be at the forefront of energy technology
and application development. To accelerate innovation and the
commercialisation of new offerings, Fortum is strengthening its in-house
innovation and digitalisation efforts and building partnerships with
leading global suppliers, technology and service companies, and research
institutions. Fortum makes direct and indirect investments in start-ups
that have promising new innovations focused on connectivity, have
disruptive potential and accelerate the transition towards a circular
economy. Fortum also invests in technologies that support better
utilisation of the current asset base and that can create new markets and
products for Fortum. The company is continuously looking for emerging
clean energy solutions and for solutions that increase resource and
system efficiency.

Changes in Group management

In August 2019, Fortum announced that Marco Ryan, a member

of Fortum’s Board of Directors, resigned from the Board following

his appointment at the energy company BP. Fortum's Shareholders’
Nomination Board evaluated the Board of Directors’ ability to function
and concluded that the Board had full capacity to continue in its
remaining composition until the 2020 Annual General Meeting.

Annual General Meeting 2019

Fortum Corporation's Annual General Meeting on 26 March 2019
adopted the Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial
Statements for the financial period 1 January-31 December 2018, and
discharged from liability the members of the Fortum Board of Directors
and the President and CEO for the year 2018.

The Annual General Meeting decided to pay a dividend of EUR 1.10
per share for the financial year that ended on 31 December 2018. The
record date for the dividend payment was 28 March 2019 and total
dividends of EUR 977 million were paid on 4 April 2019.

The Annual General Meeting confirmed the remuneration for Board
service for the upcoming term as follows: EUR 75,000 per year for the
Chairman, EUR 57,000 per year for the Deputy Chairman, EUR 40,000
per year for a Member, and EUR 57,000 per year for the Board member
acting as the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee if he or she is
not simultaneously acting as Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Board.
In addition, a fee of EUR 600 will be paid for each Board meeting and
Board Committee meeting. For Board members living outside Finland in

Europe, the fee for each meeting will be doubled, and for Board members
living outside Europe, the fee for each meeting will be tripled. For Board
members living in Finland, the fee for each Board and Board Committee
meeting will be doubled for meetings held outside Finland and tripled for
meetings held outside Europe. For Board and Committee meetings held as
a telephone conference, the basic meeting fee will be paid to all members.
No fee will be paid for decisions made without a separate meeting.

The Annual General Meeting decided that the number of the members
in the Board of Directors will be nine. Mr. Matti Lievonen was elected
as Chairman, Klaus-Dieter Maubach as Deputy Chairman, and Ms Eva
Hamilton, Mr. Kim Ignatius, Ms Essimari Kairisto, Ms Anja McAllister, Mr.
Veli-Matti Reinikkala, Mr. Marco Ryan and Mr. Philipp Résler as Members.
In August 2019, Marco Ryan resigned from the Board following his
appointment at the energy company BP.

In addition, Deloitte Oy was re-elected as the auditor with Reeta
Virolainen, APA, as the principal auditor. The auditor's fee is paid pursuant
to an invoice approved by the company.

The Annual General Meeting authorised the Board of Directors to
decide on the repurchase and disposal of the company's own shares up
to maximum of 20,000,000 shares, which corresponds to approximately
2.25% of all the shares in the company. Only the unrestricted equity
of the company can be used to repurchase own shares on the basis
of the authorisation. It was also decided that own shares cannot be
repurchased or disposed for the purposes of the company's incentive and
remuneration schemes. These authorisations cancelled the authorisations
resolved by the Annual General Meeting of 2018 and they will be
effective until the next Annual General Meeting and in any event no
longer than for a period of 18 months. The authorisations have not been
used as of 5 February 2020.

The Annual General Meeting authorised the Board of Directors to
decide on contributions in the total maximum amount of EUR 500,000 for
charitable or similar purposes, and to decide on the recipients, purposes
and other terms of the contributions. The authorisation will be effective
until the next Annual General Meeting. The authorisation has not been
used as of 5 February 2020.

Board decisions

At the meeting held after the Annual General Meeting 2019, Fortum’s
Board of Directors elected to the Nomination and Remuneration
Committee Matti Lievonen as Chairman and Eva Hamilton, Klaus-Dieter
Maubach and Anja McAlister as members. Furthermore, the Board
elected to the Audit and Risk Committee Kim Ignatius as Chairman and
Essimari Kairisto, Veli-Matti Reinikkala, Marco Ryan and Philipp Résler as
members.

Shareholders Nomination Board

On 3 October 2019, Mr. Kimmo Viertola, Director General, Prime
Minister's Office, Ownership steering department (Chairman), Mr.
Jouko Pélénen, President and CEO, Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance
Company, and Mr. Risto Murto, President and CEO, Varma Mutual
Pension Insurance Company were appointed to Fortum’'s Shareholders’
Nomination Board. In addition, the Chairman of Fortum’s Board of
Directors, Mr. Matti Lievonen, is a member of the Shareholders’
Nomination Board.

On 31 January 2020, Fortum's Shareholders’ Nomination Board
submitted its proposals to Fortum's Board of Directors for the 2020
Annual General Meeting concerning the number of the Board members,
the members to be nominated to the Board of Directors, and the election
of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman. The Shareholders’ Nomination
Board did not reach a unanimous proposal, and consequently did not
make a proposal for the remuneration paid to the Board of Directors for
their following term of office.

Other major events during the reporting period

On 19 December 2019, the Board of Directors decided to commence
the 2020-2022 long-term incentive (LT!) plan for key employees and
executives. The Board of Directors also decided to update the terms
and conditions of the LTI programme, valid for the plans commencing
as of the beginning of 2020, to include more precise malus and
clawback clauses. The 2020-2022 LTI plan is part of Fortum’s ongoing
LTI programme and otherwise follows the same principles as the
previous plan. The 2020-2022 LT! plan will comprise approximately 140

participants, including the members of Fortum Executive Management.
The Board of Directors also decided to establish a Restricted Share
programme, as a supplement to the LTI programme, and reserve
shares that potentially will be allocated under the 2020-2022 plan. The
Restricted Share programme will follow the main terms and conditions
of the general LTI programme with the exception that the allocated
shares will be delivered after the three-year plan period independent of
performance measures, subject to continued employment. The maximum
number of shares that may be delivered as a reward is expected to be
660,000 shares for the 2020-2022 LTI plan and 60,000 shares for the
2020-2022 Restricted Share plan.

On 11 October 2019, the Board of Directors decided to establish
an Employee Share Savings (ESS) programme and launch the savings
period for the year 2020 under that programme. The shares for the ESS
programme will be purchased from the market quarterly after Fortum's
interim reports have been published. Dividends paid for the shares will
be reinvested in additional shares to be purchased from the market after
the dividend payment. The Board of Directors will annually decide on the
potential launch of each individual savings period. The ESS programme
participants will, as a gross reward, be granted one matching share for
each two purchased savings shares after approximately three years from
the beginning of the savings period. The total amount of all savings for the
2020 savings period may not exceed EUR 6 million. More than 40% of the
eligible employees took the opportunity to invest in the first ESS plan.

Events after the balance sheet date
On 6 February 2020, Fortum announced, in line with its strategy and
continued review of the business portfolio, that it had decided to assess
strategic options, including possible divestment, of its district heating and
cooling businesses in Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Jarvenpaa in
Finland. Based on initial assessments, these district heating and cooling
businesses have been identified as operations that could provide higher
growth and value potential with an alternative ownership structure.

On 20 December 2019, Fortum signed an agreement to sell its
district heating business in Joensuu, Finland, to Savon Voima Oyj. The
total consideration on a debt- and cash-free basis was approximately

EUR 530 million, and the cash was received at the completion of the
divestment on 10 January 2020. Fortum will record a tax-exempt capital
gain of approximately EUR 430 million in the City Solutions segment’s
first-quarter 2020 results.

Key drivers and risks

Fortum's financial results are exposed to a number of financial, operational,
strategic, and sustainability-related risks. Fortum is exposed to these

risks both directly and indirectly through its associated companies and
joint ventures. The principal associated companies and joint ventures are
Uniper SE, TVO, OKG AB, Forsmarks Kraftgrupp AB, Kemijoki Oy, T6C-4,
and Stockholm Exergi AB. For more information about the risk exposures,
please see each respective company's annual report.

One of the key factors influencing Fortum's business performance is
the Nordic electricity wholesale price. The key short-term drivers behind
the electricity wholesale price development in the Nordic region are
commodity prices, such as coal and gas, European electricity wholesale
prices, prices for CO, emission allowances, the hydrological situation,
temperatures, and the electricity import-export balance. In the longer
term, global economic growth and changes to energy policy and
regulations impact commodity and CO, emission allowance prices, which,
in turn, impact the Nordic wholesale price of electricity. In addition,
increased volatility in exchange rates could have both translation and
transaction effects on Fortum's financials, especially through the Russian
rouble and Swedish krona.

Operational risks resulting from failed internal processes or systems or
from external events can have a negative impact on Fortum's results. In all
regions, fuel prices and power plant availability also impact profitability.

Changes in the regulatory and fiscal environment create risks and
opportunities for the energy and environmental management business.
The main strategic risk is that the regulatory and market environment
develops in a way that we have not been able to foresee and prepare for. In
response to these uncertainties, Fortum analyses and assesses a number
of future market and regulation scenarios, including the impact of these on
different generation forms and technologies. As a result, Fortum’s strategy
includes broadening of the revenue base and diversification into new

businesses, technologies, and markets. The environmental management
business is based on the framework and opportunities created by
environmental regulation. Being able to respond to customer needs created
by the tightening regulation is a key success factor.

For Fortum's Russian business, the key drivers are economic growth,
the rouble exchange rate, regulation of the heat business, and the
further development of the electricity and capacity markets. A key
profitability driver is the received capacity payments based on the CSA
contracts and Competitive Capacity Selection (CCS) auctions. The main
part of Fortum's generation capacity built after 2007 is entitled to CSA
payments for approximately 10 years after commissioning of each new
unit (approximately 15 years for renewable generation). The received
capacity payments vary, depending on the age, location, type, and size
of the plant, as well as on seasonality and availability. The CSA payments
are adjusted for, among other factors, the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), the consumer price index (CPI), and re-examination of
earnings from the electricity-only (spot) market (done every three and six
years after commissioning of a unit). In addition, thermal power plants are
entitled to clearly higher CSA payments starting approximately six years
after commissioning.

For further details on Fortum’s risks and risk management, see
the } Risk management section of the Operating and financial review
and > Note 4 Financial risk management.

Outlook

Hedging

At the end of 2019, approximately 75% of the Generation segment's
estimated Nordic power sales volume was hedged at EUR 34 per MWh
for 2020, and approximately 40% at EUR 33 per MWh for 2021.

The reported hedge ratios may vary significantly, depending on
Fortum's actions on the electricity derivatives markets. Hedges are
mainly financial contracts, most of them electricity derivatives quoted on
Nasdaq Commodities.

Financial performance and position

Capital expenditure and divestments

Fortum currently estimates its capital expenditure, including
maintenance but excluding acquisitions, to be approximately EUR 700
million (previously expected to be less than EUR 600-650 million)

in 2020. This includes approximately EUR 200 million of solar and

wind investments, which are subject to the capital recycling business
model. The maintenance capital expenditure in 2020 is estimated to be
approximately EUR 300 million, well below the level of depreciation.

Nordic market

Electricity is expected to continue to gain a higher share of total
energy consumption. Electricity demand in the Nordic countries during
the next few years is expected to grow annually by approximately
0.5% on average. The growth rate will largely be determined by the
macroeconomic development in Europe and especially in the Nordic
countries and, in the longer term, also by the rate of electrification of
industry, transportation, and heating.

During the fourth quarter of 2019 the gas price was at a low level,
and also the front-year gas price decreased. Coal prices decreased, EUA
prices developed sideways, and oil prices increased.

At the end of January 2020, the forward quotation for coal (ICE
Rotterdam) for the remainder of 2020 was around USD 53 per tonne and
the market price for EUAs for 2020 at the level of EUR 24 per tonne. The
Nordic system electricity forward price on Nasdaq Commodities for the
remainder of 2020 was around EUR 20 per MWh and for 2021 around
EUR 27 per MWh. In Germany, the electricity forward price for the
remainder of 2020 was around EUR 36 per MWh and for 2021 around
EUR 41 per MWh. The Nordic water reservoirs were about 6 TWh above
the long-term average and 13 TWh higher than one year earlier.

Generation

The Generation segment’s achieved Nordic power price typically depends
on factors such as hedge ratios, hedge prices, spot prices, availability and
Utilisation of Fortum’s flexible production portfolio, as well as currency
fluctuations. Excluding the potential effects from changes in the power
generation mix, a 1 EUR/MWh change in the Generation segment's Nordic

power sales achieved price will result in an approximately EUR 45 million
change in Fortum’s annual comparable operating profit. The achieved
power price also includes the results of optimisation of Fortum’s hydro
and nuclear production, as well as operations in the physical and financial
commodity markets.

In June 2018, the Swedish Parliament adopted new hydro legislation
effective 1 January 2019. The new legislation states that the power
industry shall create a joint hydropower fund to finance major parts of the
required environmental actions. Consequently, a fund has been established
with a total financial cap of SEK 10 billion to be paid over a 20-year period.
All major utilities will contribute to the fund based on their share of Swedish
hydropower production. Fortum’s share of the fund's total financing is 23%.
In addition to the new legislation, the Government issued an ordinance that
came into force on 11 January 2019 to establish a national prioritisation
plan for the revision of hydropower permits.

In June 2018, the Swedish Administrative Court of Appeal gave its
decisions on Fortum Sverige AB's hydropower production-related real-
estate tax assessments for the years 2009-2014. The court decisions
were not in Fortum’s favour. Fortum applied for the right to appeal from the
Supreme Administrative Court, but did not receive permission to appeal. As
the Administrative Court, the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm,
and the Supreme Administrative Court have handled only the arguments
concerning state aid, the case concerning the other legal arguments has
now been transferred back to the Administrative Court. The disputed
amount, excluding interest for the time period, totals approximately SEK
510 million (approximately EUR 49 million). Moreover, Fortum's Swedish
companies have appeals for 2011-2016 pending before the Administrative
Court relating to the real-estate tax rate for their hydropower plants and
referring to the same legal grounds. Fortum has paid the real-estate tax in
accordance with the legislation. If the final court decision is unfavourable
to Fortum, it will not impact Fortum's results. In December 2018, Fortum
Sverige AB filed a complaint to the EU Commission regarding the Swedish
real-estate tax for hydropower plants for 2017 and prior years. Fortum
has asked the Commission to investigate whether the Swedish legislation
regarding the real-estate tax for hydropower plants and the Swedish court
decisions are in line with EU state aid rules.

According to the Swedish Government's budget proposal for the coming
years, presented in September 2016, the Swedish hydropower real-estate
tax will decrease from 2.8% to 0.5%. The tax is being reduced in four steps:
in January 2017 to 2.2%; in January 2018 to 1.6%; in January 2019 to 1.0%;
and in January 2020 to 0.5%. In 2018, the tax was EUR 65 million, in 2019
EUR 40 million, and in 2020 it is expected to be approximately EUR 25
million. In addition to the decrease in the tax rate, the hydropower real-
estate tax values, which are linked to electricity prices, were updated in
2019. The real-estate tax values are updated every six years.

City Solutions

In City Solutions, growth in cash flow and earnings is mainly achieved
through investments in new plants and through acquisitions. Heat prices,
fuel cost, CO; prices, availability, taxation and regulatory changes,
flexibility and efficiency of the plants, as well as gate fees for receiving
waste are the key drivers for profitability, but power prices and weather
conditions also affect profitability. Fortum aims to create new businesses
with potential for sizeable profit contribution, e.g. within the areas of
waste and recycling and the bio-economy.

The development of Fortum Oslo Varme's business operations is
estimated to require one-time integration-related costs and investments
cover the coming years. The cost synergies materialised gradually during
2019, with targeted annual synergies of EUR 5-10 million expected to be
achieved by the end of 2020.

In March 2019, Fortum announced that it had won the right from
Solar Energy Corporation of India to build a 250-MW solar power plant
in Rajasthan, India. The solar park will be entitled to a fixed tariff of
2.48 INR/kWh for 25 years. Commissioning of the plant is expected in
the fourth quarter of 2020.

In June 2018, Fortum won the right to build a 250-MW solar power
plant in the Pavagada solar park in Karnataka, India. The capital
expenditure was approximately EUR 160 million and the solar park is
entitled to a fixed tariff of 2.85 INR/kWh for 25 years. The plant was fully
commissioned by 5 August 2019.

Financial performance and position

Consumer Solutions

Competition in the Nordic electricity retail market is expected to remain
challenging, with continued pressure on sales margins and customer
churn. To counter the market challenges and to create a solid foundation
for competitive operations, Consumer Solutions will continue its cost
spend in developing new digital services for consumers.

Russia

In the Russia segment, capacity payments based on CSA contracts are
a key driver for earnings growth, as capacity payments based on CSA
contracts are considerably higher than for CCS auctions. Currently,
Fortum's CSA capacity amounts to 2,368 MW. In February 2019, the
System Administrator of the wholesale market published data from 2018
regarding the WACC and the CPI, which were used to calculate the CSA
price for 2019. The CSA payments were revised downwards to reflect
the lower bond rates and upwards due to the lower earnings from the
electricity-only-market. The net impact of the adjustments was a minor
increase of the CSA payments for 2019.

In addition, thermal power plants are entitled to clearly higher CSA
payments starting approximately six years after commissioning. In 2020,
no such increase in CSA payments is expected for the Fortum generation
fleet.

Fortum’s other Russian generation capacity, totalling 2,560 MW, is
allowed to participate in the CCS auctions. The long-term CCS auctions
for the years 2018-2021 were held in 2015, 2016, and 2017. All Fortum
plants offered in the auctions were selected. The nominal CCS price was
411 tRUB/MW/month for 2018, 110 tRUB/MW/month for 2019, 115
+tRUB/MW/month for 2020, and 134 tRUB/MW/month for 2021. The
CCS auctions for 2022-2024 were held in August 2019. The nominal
CCS price was 168 tRUB/MW/month for 2022, 171 tRUB/MW/month for
2023, and 182 tRUB/MW/month for 2024. The CCS auction for 2025
is expected to be held in February 2020. Fortum has also obtained
so-called "forced mode status’, i.e. it receives payments with a higher
rate, for some of the units at the Argayash power plant. “Forced mode
status” was obtained for 195 MW for the years 2018-2019, for 175 MW
for the year 2020, and for 105 MW for the year 2021.

In June 2019, Fortum won the right to build 5.6 MW of solar capacity
in a CSA auction, in addition to the 110 MW won in June 2018. The
power plants will receive a guaranteed CSA price for a period of 15
years, corresponding to approximately RUB 14,000 per MWh and RUB
15,000 per MWh, respectively. The plants are to be commissioned during
2021-2022.

In June 2018, the Fortum-Rusnano wind investment fund (Fortum's
ownership 50%) won the right to build 823 MW of wind capacity in a CSA
auction. The wind parks were to be commissioned during 2019-2023
and will receive a guaranteed CSA price corresponding to approximately
RUB 7,000-8,000 per MWh for a period of 15 years. In December 2018,
the wind investment fund made an investment decision on a 100-MW
wind farm.

In June 2017, the Fortum-Rusnano wind investment fund won the
right to build 1,000 MW of wind capacity in a CSA auction. The wind
parks were to be commissioned during 2018-2022 and will receive 2
guaranteed CSA price corresponding to approximately RUB 7,000-9,000
per MWh for a period of 15 years. In the fourth quarters of 2017, 2018,
and 2019, the wind investment fund made investment decisions on a
50-MW, 200-MW, and 250-MW wind farm, respectively.

The Russian Government increased the gas price by 1.4% in July 2019.
Fortum estimates the gas price to be increased by 3% in July 2020.

Other Operations
For information on the financial impact of the Uniper shareholding, please

Income taxation

In June 2018, the Swedish Government decided to lower the Swedish
corporate tax in two steps, from 22.0% to 21.4%, effective January 2019,
and to 20.6%, effective January 2021.

In Belgium, Fortum has received income tax assessments for the years
2008-2012. The tax authorities disagree with the tax treatment of Fortum
EIF NV, which was later merged into Fortum Project Finance NV. Fortum
finds the tax authorities’ interpretation to be inconsistent with the local
regulation and has appealed the decisions. The Court of First Instance

in Antwerp rejected Fortum's appeal for the years 2008 and 2009 in
June 2014. Fortum found the decision unjustifiable and appealed to the
Court of Appeal. In January 2016, Fortum received a favourable decision
from the Court of Appeal in Antwerp in which the Court disagreed with
the tax authorities’ interpretation and the tax assessment for 2008 was
nullified. The tax authorities disagreed with the decision and filed an
appeal to the Supreme Court (Hof van Cassatie) in March 2016. In April
2019, the Advocate General at the Supreme Court issued his opinion,
which was in favour of Fortum Project Finance. In May 2019, the
Supreme Court, however, annulled the decision of the Court of Appeal
of Antwerp and referred the case back to the Court of Appeal of Ghent
for full retrial. Fortum's appeals concerning 2009-2012 are still pending
and Fortum expects the remaining years to follow the final decision

for 2008. Based on legal analysis and a supporting legal opinion, no
provision has been accounted for. The amount of additional tax claimed
is EUR 36 million for the year 2008, EUR 27 million for 2009, EUR 15
million for 2010, EUR 24 million for 2011, and EUR 15 million for 2012.
The tax has already been paid.

In March 2018, the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court decided
not to grant leave to appeal to Fortum with respect to the interest
deduction cases relating to the years 2009-2012. The unfavourable
decision of the Administrative Court of Appeal from June 2017 therefore
remains in force. The additional tax and interest, in total SEK 1,175
million (EUR 122 million), was paid in 2016 and booked as a cost in the
second-quarter 2017 results. There are strong grounds to argue that
these decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme
Administrative Court violate EU law and fundamental rights under EU
law. On these grounds, Fortum filed a summons application in December
2018 to the District Court of Stockholm in which damages are claimed
from the Swedish state in these cases. Fortum also filed a request
to initiate a mutual agreement procedure between Sweden and the
Netherlands for the year 2012 (» Note 37).

Sustainability

Sustainability at Fortum

Fortum gives balanced consideration in its operations to climate and
resource issues, as well as its impacts on personnel and society. Fortum
conducted a sustainability materiality analysis in 2019 and the renewed
sustainability priority areas are the following:

Climate and

Personnel and society resources

Business ethics and Employee wellbeing, health Climate change and

compliance and safety GHG emissions
Customer rights and Labour rights Energy efficiency
satisfaction
Human rights Innovation and digitalisation Circular economy
Corporate governance Economic value creation Emissions to air, land
and water
Stakeholder engagement Diversity and equal Water use
opportunity
Security of supply

The Group-level sustainability targets are linked to the main
sustainability priority areas and emphasise Fortum's role in society. They
measure not only environmental and safety targets, but also Fortum’s
reputation, customer satisfaction, employee wellbeing, and the security
of power and heat production. Targets are set annually and are based
on continuous operational improvement. A new target in 2019 is the
Contractor safety improvement index.

The achievement of the sustainability targets is monitored in monthly,
quarterly and annual reporting. Fortum publishes a yearly Sustainability
Report with additional information on the company’s sustainability
performance.

Fortum's goal is to achieve excellent financial performance in
strategically selected core areas through strong competence and
responsible ways of operating. Fortum measures financial performance
with return on capital employed (long-term target: at least 10%) and
capital structure (long-term target: comparable net debt/EBITDA
around 2.5x).

Fortum is a significant economic actor in its operating countries. The
most significant direct monetary flows of Fortum’'s operations come
from revenue from customers, procurements of goods and services from

suppliers, compensation to lenders, dividends to shareholders, growth and
maintenance investments, employee wages and salaries, and taxes paid.

Fortum supports social development and wellbeing in its operating
countries by e.g. paying taxes. The tax benefits Fortum produces to
society include not only corporate income taxes, but also several other
taxes. In 2019, Fortum's taxes borne were EUR 397 (299) million. Fortum
publishes its tax footprint annually.

Fortum is listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki exchange and is included
in the STOXX Global ESG Leaders, OMX Sustainability Finland, ECPI®,
Euronext Vigeo Eurozone 120, Euronext Vigeo Europe 120 and Equileap
Gender Equality indices. Fortum is also ranked in category B in the CDP
Climate Change 2019 rating, and it has received a rating A in the MSCI
ESG Ratings assessment in 2019, and a Prime Status (B-) rating by ISS
ESG Corporate Rating. In June 2019, Fortum became a constituent of the
FTSE4Good Index Series.

Fortum's sustainability reporting covers all functions under Fortum’s
operational control, including subsidiaries in all countries of operation.
The figures for power and heat generation, capacities and investments
include also figures from Fortum’s share in associated companies and
joint ventures that sell their production to the owners at cost.

In the Financial Statements, Uniper is treated as an associated
company and Stockholm Exergi as a joint venture, and both companies
are consolidated with the equity method. Stockholm Exergi and Uniper
are not included in Fortum’s sustainability targets and indicators nor in the
descriptions of management practices. Stockholm Exerg’s and Uniper’s
sustainability information are available in the companies’ sustainability
reports that can be found on the companies’ own web pages.

Sustainability risks and opportunities

Fortum’s operations are exposed to risks, which if materialised can have
adverse effects on the environment and on the safety and security of
employees, contractors and neighbouring societies. Key sustainability

risks, including climate-related risks, are reported to Fortum Executive
Management and the Audit and Risk Committee as part of the annual
review of material risks and uncertainties for the Group. These risks are
presented in the Risk management section in the Operating and financial
review. Climate change and the need for decarbonisation and resource
efficiency are changing the energy industry in profound way, and these
changes also create new business opportunities for Fortum.

Sustainability governance and policies

Sustainability management at Fortum is strategy-driven and is based
‘on the company’s Values, the Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code of
Conduct, the Sustainability Policy and other Group policies and their
specifying instructions. As sustainability is an integral part of Fortum’s
strategy, the highest decision making on sustainability and climate-
related matters falls within the duties of the members of the Board of
Directors, who share joint responsibility in these matters.

Fortum Executive Management decides on the sustainability approach
and Group-level sustainability targets that guide annual planning. The
Group's performance targets, including sustainability and climate-related
targets, are ultimately approved by Fortum’'s Board of Directors. Fortum's
line management is responsible for the implementation of the Group's
policies and instructions and for day-to-day sustainability management.
Realisation of the safety targets is a part of Fortum’s short-term incentive
system.

Fortum is a participant of the UN Global Compact initiative and the
UN Caring for Climate initiative. Fortum respects and supports the
International Bill of Human Rights, the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child, and the core conventions of the International Labour
Organisation (ILO). Additionally, Fortum recognises in its operations
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD

Sustainal

Business ethics

The Fortum Code of Conduct and Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct
define how we treat others, engage in business, safeguard corporate
assets, and how Fortum expects suppliers and business partners to
operate. Fortum's Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s
mission and values and has approved the Fortum Code of Conduct.
Fortum has zero tolerance for corruption and fraud and does not award
donations to political parties or political activities, religious organisations,
authorities, municipalities or local administrations.

In addition to internal reporting channels, Fortum employees and
partners can report suspicions of misconduct confidentially by using the
“SpeakUp” channel on Fortum’s internal and external web pages.

Suspected misconduct and measures related to ethical business
practices and compliance with regulations are regularly reported to the
Audit and Risk Committee.

No cases of corruption or bribery were confirmed in 2019.

Climate and resources
Fortum's Group-level targets for climate and resources are related to CO,
emissions, energy efficiency, secure supply of electricity and heat for
customers, and major Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) incidents.
The Group Sustainability Policy together with the Minimum
Requirements for EHS Management steer Fortum’s environmental
management. Investments, acquisitions and divestments are assessed
based on the sustainability assessment criteria defined in the Group's
Investment Manual. Operational-level activities follow the requirements
set forth in the ISO 14001 environmental management standard, and
99.8% (99.9%) of Fortum’s power and heat production worldwide has ISO
14001 certification.

Energy
Fortum’s energy production is primarily based on carbon dioxide-free
hydropower and nuclear power and on energy-efficient combined heat

and power (CHP). In line with the strategy, Fortum targets a multi-
gigawatt wind and solar portfolio, which is subject to the capital recycling
business model.

In 2019, Fortum's power generation was 76.3 (74.6) TWh and heat
production 26.4 (29.8) TWh. 59% (57%) of the total power generation
was CO,-free. In Europe, 96% (96%) of the power generation was CO,-
free. Investments in CO,-free production were EUR 401 (278) million.
Investments in hydro, wind and solar power and bioenergy totalled
EUR 344 (180) million.

Fortum has a Group-level target to achieve annual energy-efficiency
improvements of 21,900 GWh by 2020 compared to 2012. Fortum
achieved 1,707 GWh/a by the end of 2019.

The main fuels that Fortum uses to produce electricity and heat are
natural gas, uranium, coal, waste-derived fuels and biomass fuels. The
most significant fuel was natural gas, which accounted for 63% (63%) of
the total fuel consumption. The next highest fuel use was uranium 20%
(21%). Coal accounted for 10% (8%) of the total fuel use, and waste-
derived fuels and biomass fuels 3% (4%) and 3% (3%), respectively. Russia
accounted for 99% of the use of natural gas and 57% of the use of coal.

An uninterrupted and reliable energy supply is critical for society
to function. With planned preventive maintenance and condition
monitoring, Fortum ensures that the power plants operate reliably to
produce the electricity and heat customers need. The energy availability
of the company’s CHP plants in 2019 was, on average, 95.9% (96.4%),
outperforming the target of 295.0%.

Climate

Fortum expects the concern about climate change to increase the
demand for low-carbon production and energy-efficient solutions and
products. Fortum aims to mitigate climate change by investing in CO,-
free energy production and by improving energy and resource efficiency.
Fortum is also adapting its operations to climate change in production
planning and in the assessment of growth projects and investments.

In 2019, Fortum’s direct CO, emissions were 19.1 (20.1) Mt. 85%

of CO, emissions originated from Russian power plants. Direct CO,
emissions decreased primarily because of the decreased power and heat
production. Of the total CO, emissions, 2.1 (2.5) Mt were within the EU’s
emissions trading scheme (ETS). The estimate for Fortum’s free emission
allowances in 2019 is 0.7 (0.8) Mt.

Fortum’s total CO, emissions (million tonnes, Mt) 2019 2018 2017
Total emissions 19.1 201 184
Emissions subject to ETS 21 2.5 24
Free emission allowances 07 08 1.0
Emissions in Russia 16.3 169 15.4

In 2019, Fortum's specific carbon dioxide emissions from total energy
production were 189 (192) g/kWh. The specific CO, emissions from total
energy production as a five-year average were 186 (186) g/kWh, which is
better than Fortum's Group target of <200 g/kWh.

Circular economy
Fortum’s aim is to promote resource efficiency improvements and the
transition towards a more extensive circular economy. Resource efficiency
and maximising the added value of waste and biomass are key priorities in
the environmental approach, as defined in the Group Sustainability Policy.
In 2019, Fortum received about 1.6 (1.6) million tonnes of non-
hazardous waste and about 600,000 (600,000) tonnes of hazardous
waste from customers. As much of the waste stream as possible is
recycled, recovered or reused. Waste that is unsuitable for recycling or
reuse as a material is incinerated in Fortum’s waste-to-energy plants in
the Nordic countries, Lithuania and Poland.

Emissions
Fortum’s activities cause various emissions to air. In addition to carbon
dioxide (CO,) emissions, these include flue-gas emissions, such as sulphur

Nitrogen oxide emissions 248 261 26.4
Particle emissions 11.7 96 15.8

Fortum's target regarding major EHS incidents is to have no more than
18 major EHS incidents annually. Major EHS incidents are monitored,
reported and investigated, and corrective actions are implemented. In
2019, there were 11 (18) major EHS incidents in Fortum’s operations.
The major EHS incidents included three fires, two environmental non-
compliances, four leaks, one explosion, and one INES (International
Nuclear Event Scale) level 1 incident. The major EHS incidents did not
have significant environmental impacts.

Water and biodiversity

Fortum uses large volumes of water at various types of power plants
and in district heating networks. In most cases, power plants do not
consume water — the water is discharged back to the same water
system from where it was withdrawn. Fortum withdrew a total of
2,100 (2,100) million m? of water in production operations; 94% of this
amount was used as cooling water.

Fortum’s main impacts on biodiversity are related to hydropower
production. Fuel procurement and flue-gas emissions may also have a
negative impact on biodiversity. On the other hand, increasing CO,-free
production mitigates the biodiversity loss caused by climate change.
Fortum’s Biodiversity Manual and Biodiversity Action Plan define the
company's approach to biodiversity management.

Radioactive waste

In 2019, 21.9 (20.3) tonnes of spent nuclear fuel was removed from
Loviisa power plant’s reactors in Finland. High-level radioactive spent fuel
is stored in an interim storage at the Loviisa power plant site. The final

Key Parent company
figures _ financial statements

disposal of the high-level radioactive spent fuel originating at the Loviisa
power plant is scheduled to begin at Olkiluoto in Eurajoki in the 2040s.

Personnel and society

Fortum's Group-level targets for personnel and society are related to
operational and occupational safety, employee wellbeing, as well as
reputation and customer satisfaction.

Personnel
The Group Human Resources Policy is based on the company’s Values,
Leadership Principles and Code of Conduct. The HR Policy guides the
daily work in the company, and the implementation of the policy is
followed up regularly through the employee engagement survey, the
annual performance and development discussions, as well as other
feedback practices.

Fortum’s operations are mainly based in the Nordic countries, Russia,
Poland and the Baltic Rim area. The total number of employees at the end
of 2019 was 8,191 (8,286).

Occupational safety

For Fortum, excellence in safety is the foundation of the company’s
business and an absolute prerequisite for efficient and interruption-free
production. Fortum strives to be a safe workplace for the employees,
contractors and service providers who work for the company. The Group

and more detailed Group-level EHS manuals steer the work. A certified
OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001 safety management system covers 96.5%
(97.0%) of Fortum’s power and heat production worldwide.

In 2019, Fortum's Lost Workday Injury Frequency (LWIF) for own
personnel and contractors was 1.7 (1.8), achieving the set target level
(1.7). In 2019, there was one occupational violence case in Russia, which
was classified as severe accident. The Group target for 2019 was zero
severe occupational accidents.

In 2019, the quality of investigation process of occupational accidents,
major EHS incidents, and serious near misses was at the level of 3.0 (3.0),
achieving the set target level (3.0).

In 2019, the GAP index was at the level 3.0 (2.0), achieving the set
target level (3.0). The GAP index measures how well the Group's EHS
minimum requirements are realised at the power plant level.

Fortum is continuing its efforts to improve contractor safety, and
it systematically assesses contractor safety performance as part of
supplier qualification and during work. In 2019, contractor safety
improved significantly, and the Contractor safety improvement index
was at the level of 2.0, achieving the set target level (2.0). However, the
assessment had not yet covered all Fortum operations. The Contractor
safety improvement index measures how well Fortum has managed to
implement measures targeting improvements in contractor safety.

In 2019, Fortum introduced a “Safety walks” training programme for
Fortum's top management. The programme paid special attention to top
management's role in improving the safety culture. It included coaching
and practical training in the necessary personal leadership skills. It also
focused on systems and structures that support the transformation of
the safety culture.

Personnel wellbeing

Fortum’s goal with workplace wellbeing activities is to promote the health
and occupational safety of employees and the functionality of the work
community. In 2019, the Energise Your Day wellbeing programme was
expanded to the former Hafslund companies in Finland, Sweden, Norway
and Poland, and is now under way in all Fortum’s operating countries.

especially in Russia and Norway.

Society

Customer satisfaction

Fortum’s targets for reputation and customer satisfaction are monitored
annually. In the One Fortum Survey in 2019, the combined company
reputation index among key stakeholder groups was 72.3 (72.5) points,
‘on a scale of 0-100, which did not meet the target of =73.0 points.

The Group-level target (70-74 points, on a scale of 0-100) for
customer satisfaction was achieved among all business areas with two
exceptions: retail electricity sales and EV charging solutions for both
consumers and businesses.

Supply chain

Fortum’s total purchasing volume in 2019 was EUR 3.8 (3.7) billion,

and Fortum had about 14,000 suppliers of goods and services. Fortum
expects its business partners to act responsibly and to comply with the
Fortum Code of Conduct and the Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct.
Fortum assesses the performance of its business partners with supplier
qualification and supplier audits. In 2019, Fortum conducted a total of 14

(13) supplier audits in Poland, Russia, India, China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

In addition, one coal supplier in Kazakhstan was assessed against the
Bettercoal Code by a third party.

Human rights

Fortum’s goal is to operate in accordance with the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights and to apply these principles
in company’s own operations as well as in country and partner risk
assessments and supplier audits.

Notes

A human rights assessment is carried out for investment projects —
especially in new operating areas — and also for new countries where
Fortum plans to expand the sales of products and services. In 2019, 6 (7)
of these assessments were made.

In 2019, there were no grievances related to human rights filed
through Fortum’s formal grievance channels, nor were there any
grievances carried over from the previous year.

Corporate citizenship

Fortum’s operations impact the local communities where the power
plants are located, and the company engages in many kinds of
collaboration with local stakeholders. According to Fortum’s Policy

for Sponsoring and Donations, the company’s sponsorships focus on

the wellbeing of children and youth, renewable energy projects, R&D
and innovations supporting Fortum’s strategy. In addition, Fortum
sponsors projects related to recycling, recovery and reuse. Fortum also
‘engages in collaboration with universities through different research and
development projects. In 2019, Fortum’s support for activities promoting
the common good totalled about EUR 2.7 (3.8) million. In addition, the
grants awarded by Fortum Foundation, not part of Fortum Group, totalled
about EUR 660,000 (680,000).

Risk management

Risk management

Risk management framework and objectives

Fortum's Risk Management framework is described in the Group Risk
Policy and supporting documents. The Group Risk Policy includes

an overview of Fortum’s risk management systems consisting of the
general principles of risk management and the main features of the risk
management process. The objectives of the risk management systems
are to;

support the development of the Group strategy,

support strategy execution,

support the achievement of agreed targets within acceptable risk
levels so that the Group’s ability to meet financial commitments is not
compromised,

ensure the understanding of material risks and uncertainties affecting
Fortum, and

support the prevention of accidents that can have a severe effect on
the health and safety of employees or third parties, and from incidents
that can have a material impact on Fortum’s assets, reputation or the
environment.

Risk management organisation

The main principle is that risks are managed at source meaning that each
Division and Corporate Function Head is responsible for managing risks
that arise within their business operations. However, certain risks, such
as currency, interest rate, liquidity and refinancing risks, are managed
centrally.

The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) is responsible for monitoring the
efficiency of the company’s risk management systems and for annually
reviewing the Group Risk Policy and the material risks and uncertainties.
Corporate Risk Management, a function headed by the Chief Risk Officer
(CRO) reporting to the CFO, provides instructions and tools which
support the Group in running an efficient risk management process.
Corporate Risk Management is responsible for assessing and reporting

Risk manuals and Guidelines

Fortum’s risk management process is designed to support the achievement
of agreed targets by ensuring that risk management activities are
consistent with the general principles of risk management and that risks
are monitored and followed-up in a prudent manner. The main features of
risk management process consist of event identification, risk assessment,
risk response and risk control. Identification is regularly carried out
according to a structured process and risks are assessed in terms of
impact and likelihood according to a Group-common methodology. Impact
is assessed not only in monetary terms, but also in terms of health and
safety, environment and reputation. All risks have risk owners who are
responsible for implementing actions to respond to the risk. Risk responses
can be to accept, avoid, mitigate or transfer the risk. Risk control processes,
which include monitoring and reporting of risks, are designed to support
compliance with approved instructions, manuals and guidelines and to
ensure that risk exposures remain within approved limits and mandates.

Consolidated
financial statements

Operating and

financial review Notes

Fortum's Board of Directors approves the Group Risk Policy and the
CEO approves Group Risk Instructions covering commodity market

risks, counterparty credit risks, and operational risks. Fortum also has
other Group policies and instructions covering e.g. compliance, privacy,
sustainability, treasury and cyber and information security risks which
are aligned with the Group Risk Policy. There are risk mandates or

limits defined for commodity market risks, counterparty credit risks and
financial risks. Divisions and Corporate Functions issues risk manuals and
guidelines as needed which detail how the Group Risk Instructions are
implemented.

Risk factors

Strategic risks

The main strategic risks are that energy policy, regulation, technology or
the business environment develop in ways that have not been foreseen
and prepared for. Future energy market and regulation scenarios,
including the impact of these to Fortum's business, are continuously
assessed and analysed. It is part of Fortum’s strategy to, in the long-
term, build options to broaden the base of revenues into new businesses,
technologies and markets.

Risks which could hinder Fortum in executing its strategy are
continuously assessed, monitored and reported as part of the strategy
work. These risks include an inability to identify and carry out successful
investments and acquisitions with the related project and integration risks.

Business Environment

Fortum operates in a global business environment and is therefore
exposed to political and other risks which affect the macroeconomic
development and consumer behaviour in the markets where Fortum
‘operates. As operations expand to new geographical regions, markets
and businesses, the operating environment becomes more complex and
this risk may increase. The current trend of increasingly nationalistic
policies and protectionism may lead to more trade restrictions which in

turn could affect demand for Fortum’s products and services. Fortum
continuously monitors how the business environment develops in its
operating countries in order to be able to react quickly to market shifts
and changes in consumer behaviour.

Investment and acqu n risks

Fortum’s strategy includes growth of operations in new businesses,
technologies and geographies. This includes an increasing number of
partly-owned companies and joint ventures where Fortum does not
necessarily have full operational control. Fortum is exposed to a number
of risks indirectly through these companies and joint ventures. These risks
are monitored and followed-up through Fortum’s representation in the
respective company Board of Directors and through expert committees.
The principal associated companies and joint ventures are Forsmarks
Kraftgrupp AB, Kemijoki Oy, OKG AB, Stockholm Exergi AB, TGC-1,
Teollisuuden Voima Oyj and Uniper SE. The most significant of these is
Uniper SE due to its size, complexity and the phase of the investment.
For more information about the risk exposures in these companies,
please see each respective company’s annual report and other relevant
disclosures.

Fortum’s recent and current investments, as well as any future
investment or acquisition, including possible future partnerships, entail
risk such as:

+ increased overall operating complexity and requirements for
management, personnel and other resources,

+ inability to understand the value drivers and their uncertainties in
investments or potential acquisition targets,

+ inability to manage complex integrations of companies with different
cultures and processes, including possibly uncooperative management,

+ inability to understand and manage new markets and jurisdictions with
different cultural, ethical and legal frameworks,

+ inability to understand and manage sustainability risks and safety
issues related to new businesses, markets and technologies.

These risks are managed as part of the investment process. The + increasing policy costs and uncoordinated national mechanisms

Investment Manual includes requirements for risk identification,
assessment and action plans for mitigating identified risks before
investment decisions are made. It also sets requirements to follow-up
risks in projects and acquisitions. Risks in large projects are mitigated
through contract structures and insurance coverage. Partner risk
assessments are performed before entering into joint ventures or other
material partnership agreements, and there is also a country entry
process which includes a country risk assessment before decisions to
enter into a new market can be made.

Energy policy and regulation risks
The energy business is heavily influenced by national and EU-level energy
policies and regulations. Fortum’s strategy has been developed based
‘on scenarios of the future development of the regulatory environment in
both existing and potential new businesses and market areas. The overall
complexity and possible regulatory changes in the various operating
countries pose a risk if Fortum is not able to anticipate, identify and
manage those changes efficiently.

Fortum maintains an active dialogue with the bodies involved in the
development of laws and regulations in order to manage these risks
and proactively contribute to the development of the energy policy and
regulatory framework.

Nordic/EU

Fortum's strategy in the power and heat sectors is based on a market-
driven development, which would mean more interconnections and
competition supported by increasing policy harmonization. Even if the
Nordic power market has a long tradition of harmonization, national
policies vary considerably when it comes to e.g. taxation, permitting,
subsidies and market model meaning that Fortum has to manage
risks related to both EU regulation and national regulation. Potential
risks related to the future energy, circular economy and climate policy
framework include;

hindering an integrated, flexible and dynamic power market,

+ overlapping national carbon policies diluting the EU ETS and carbon
price despite the ETS reform,

+ increasing cost burden for hydro power in Finland, driven by fish
obligations, grid costs and real estate taxation,

+ unbalanced implementation of the EU Water Framework directive in
Sweden leading to lower production volumes,

+ stricter sustainability requirements for forest biomass leading to
reduced availability and increasing costs,

+ implementation of national waste incineration taxes or restrictive
measures affecting the operational environment or the competitiveness
of the waste-to-energy business as part of overall circular economy
promotion,

+ acceptability issues related to different fuels or technologies (bio,
waste, nuclear, wind, CCS etc.) potentially limiting or slowing down new
investments either in power production or transmission grids,

+ substantial retroactive changes and/or discontinuation of prevailing
CHP support schemes in the Baltic countries and Poland or
deteriorating competitiveness of CHP due to fuel tax increases,

+ undue heavy-touch price-regulation of district heating in order to
enhance the affordability and other social aspects of protecting the
end-customers.

The inter-linkage of these issues create uncertainty as changes in policies
in one area could undermine the effects of policy changes in other areas.

Russia

Fortum’s business in Russia is exposed to political, economic and social
uncertainties and risks resulting from changes in regulation, legislation,
economic and social upheaval and other similar factors. The current
economic sanctions may be enlarged and/or extended having direct and
indirect impacts on the business environment. The main energy policy
related risks in Russia are linked to the development of the whole energy

sector, part of which, is liberalised, like the wholesale electricity market,
while other parts, like gas, heat, and retail electricity, are not. Regulated
sectors are inherently exposed to a risk of regulatory changes which
could affect Fortum's operations.

Technology risks

Fortum’s strategy includes developing or acquiring new technologies, as
well as digitalising the business. Fortum’s R&D and innovation activities
focus on the development of the energy system towards a future
low-carbon economy and developing circular economy solutions, bio-
‘economy, other renewable energy concepts and innovative solutions
for its customers. New technologies expose Fortum to risks related to
intellectual property rights, data privacy and viability of technologies.
Technology risks are managed by assessing and monitoring the viability
of new technology throughout its development cycle, and selectively
developing and investing in a diversified portfolio of projects consisting
of different technologies.

Sustainability risks

Corporate social responsibility and sustainable development are integral
parts of Fortum’s strategy. Fortum gives balanced consideration to
economic, environmental and social responsibility. Changes to laws,
regulations and the business environment can pose a risk if not identified
and managed effectively and the same applies to changes in views of our
main stakeholders. In order to identify and manage these risks, Fortum
endorses a number of international voluntary charters, standards and
guidelines in the area of sustainability, conducts stakeholder surveys
annually in order to identify the most material issues for our stakeholders
and has defined internal policies and instructions on how to conduct
business. Divisions and Corporate Functions identify and assess
sustainability risks related to their operations and define mitigating
actions. Corporate Sustainability executes oversight as part of the
Group's risk management process.

Risk management

Environmental, health and safety and social risks
Operating power and heat generation plants and circular economy
services involves the usage, storage and transportation of fuels and
materials, including hazardous waste, that can have adverse effects on
the environment and expose personnel, contractors and third parties
to safety risks. Assessment of environmental risks and preparedness
to operate in exceptional and emergency situations follows legislative
requirements as well as the requirements in the environmental
management standard (ISO 14001). The same approach, based on the
requirements in the operational health and safety standard (OHSAS
18001 or ISO 45001), applies to risks related to occupational health and
safety and how to operate in emergency situations.

Environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks as well as social
risks related to Fortum’s supply chain are evaluated through supplier
qualification as well as internal and external audits and risk assessments
including partner and country risk assessments. Corrective and
preventive actions are implemented when necessary. EHS and social
risks related to investments are evaluated in accordance with Fortum’s
Investment Manual. Environmental risks and liabilities in relation to past
actions have been assessed and, where necessary, provisions have been
made for future remedial costs.

Tax risk
Fortum operates in a number of countries and is therefore exposed to
changes in and conflicts between local and international taxation. Political
pressure has resulted in numerous new laws and rules with unclear
wording and wide scope creating differences in how tax authorities
interpret new rules. This has led to a tax environment with increased tax
burden and poor clarity of tax consequences. Clarity and predictability
around how our operations are taxed has decreased due to the changing
regulation. In addition, new regulation creates material volume of new
complex compliance work.

Fortum aims to identify simple and cost-efficient solutions to
manage taxes in a sustainable manner. Fortum's tax principle is that

tax is a consequence of business and that compliance with tax rules
and legislation and transparency result in a correct tax contribution.
This principle leaves no room for artificial or other aggressive solutions.
Fortum is continuously following the development of tax related issues
and their impact on the Group and maintains an active dialogue with tax
authorities in unclear cases. Tax-related issues are communicated openly
both internally and externally and Fortum’s tax footprint is published
annually.

Business ethics and compliance risks

Fortum’s operations are subject to laws, rules and regulations set forth
by the relevant authorities, exchanges, and other regulatory bodies

in all markets in which Fortum operates. Fortum’s ability to operate in
certain countries may be affected by future changes to local laws and
regulations.

Fortum’s Code of Conduct enhances the understanding of the
importance of business ethics for all Fortum employees, contractors and
partners. Prevention of corruption is one of the Code of Conduct’s focus
areas. Fortum has procedures for anti-corruption including prevention,
oversight, reporting and enforcement based on the requirements
prescribed in international legislation. Fortum’s supplier code of conduct
sets sustainability requirements for suppliers of goods and services.
The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the United
Nations Global Compact and is divided into four sections: business
principles including anti-corruption, human rights, labour standards and
environment.

Fortum systematically identifies, assesses, mitigates and reports
compliance risks including risks related to business ethics. Internal
controls are implemented to prevent the possibilities of unauthorised
activities or non-compliance with Group policies and instructions.
Fortum’s rolling compliance programme includes a risk-based
prioritisation of the development and implementation of mitigating
actions. Training and communication play a key role in increasing the
awareness in the organisation.

Financial risks

Commodity market and fuel risks

Fortum’s business is exposed to fluctuations in prices and availability
of commodities used in the production and sales of energy products.
The main exposure is toward electricity prices and volumes, prices
of emissions and prices and availability of fuels. Fortum hedges its
exposure to commodity market risks in accordance with approved
Hedging Guidelines and Mandates. For further information on hedge
ratios, exposures, sensitivities and outstanding derivatives contracts,
see > Note 4 Financial risk management.

Electricity price and volume risks
In competitive electricity markets, such as the Nordpool spot market
exchange in the Nordic region, the wholesale price of electricity is
determined as the balance between supply and demand. The short-
term factors affecting electricity prices and volumes on the Nordic
market include hydrological conditions, temperature, wind, CO; emission
allowance prices, fuel prices, economic development, transmission
capacity and the import/export situation.

Electricity price risks are mainly hedged by entering into electricity
derivatives contracts on the Nasdaq Commodities exchange. The ability
to implement hedging strategies is dependent on a well-functioning and
liquid derivatives market. There is a risk of decreasing liquidity on the
Nasdaq Commodities exchange, and alternatives including use of OTC
derivative contracts and products traded on other exchanges are used
to mitigate this risk. Hedging strategies are continuously evaluated as
electricity and other commodity market prices, the hydrological balance
and other relevant parameters change. In 2019, the models used for
evaluating hedging strategies and reporting risk were developed to
cover more parameters and improve the use of especially hydrological
data. Hedging of the Generation segment’s power sales is performed
in EUR on a Nordic level covering both Finland and Sweden, and the
currency component of these hedges in the Swedish entity is currently

Risk management

not hedged. In Russia, electricity and capacity prices are the main source
of market risk. Electricity price exposure is partly mitigated through
regulated fixed-price bilateral agreements, but the majority of electricity
sales is exposed to spot price risk. Capacity from newer units is sold
under capacity supply agreements where the price is set by the Russian
Federation to ensure the return on investments. Capacity from old units
has been sold until 2024 via capacity supply auctions which have already
been conducted.

Emission and environmental value risks
The European Union has an emissions trading scheme to reduce the
amount of CO, emissions. In addition to the emissions trading scheme,
there are other trading schemes in environmental values in place in
Sweden, Norway and Poland. Part of Fortum’s power and heat generation
is subject to requirements of these schemes. There is currently no trading
scheme in Russia for emissions or other environmental values. However,
Russia has announced intentions to comply with the Paris Agreement, but
there is uncertainty related to how and when a possible carbon market
could be implemented.

The main factors influencing the prices of CO, emission allowances
and other environmental values are political decisions and the supply
and demand balance. Fortum hedges its exposure to these prices
and volumes through the use of CO, derivatives and environmental
certificates.

Fuel price and volume risks

Power and heat generation requires use of fuels that are purchased on
global or local markets. The main fuels used by Fortum are natural gas,
uranium, coal, various biomass-based fuels and waste. The main risk
factor for fuels that are traded on global markets such as coal and natural
gas, is the uncertainty in price. Prices are largely affected by demand

and supply imbalances that can be caused by, eg. increased demand
growth in developing countries, natural disasters or supply constraints in
countries experiencing political or social unrest. For fuels that are sourced
on local or regional markets, such as bio-fuels, the volume risk in terms of

availability of the raw material of appropriate quality is more significant as
there may be a limited number of suppliers. Due to the current sanctions,
there are also risks related to imported fuels from Russia.

In the Nordic market, exposure to fuel prices is limited due to Fortum’s
flexible generation capacity which allows for switching between different
fuels according to prevailing market conditions. The remaining exposure
to fuel price risk is mitigated through fixed- price physical delivery
contracts or derivative contracts. The main fuel source for heat and
power generation in Russia is natural gas which is partially regulated
limiting the price risk exposure.

Liquidity and refinancing risks

Fortum's business is capital intensive and there is a constant need to
ensure efficient financing. Fortum maintains a diversified financing
structure in terms of debt maturity profile, debt instruments and
geographical markets. Liquidity and refinancing risks are managed
through a combination of cash positions and committed credit facility
agreements. The credit risk of cash positions has been mitigated by
diversifying the deposits to high-credit quality financial institutions and
issuers of corporate debt.

Fortum’s access to and cost of financing is dependent on having an
investment-grade rating. The current investment in Uniper has increased
Fortum’s leverage, and with the announced increase in ownership,
there is an increased risk of downgrade in the credit rating which could
negatively impact Fortum’s access to cost-efficient financing. After the
closing of transaction, through which an additional minimum of 20.5%
share in Uniper will be acquired, Fortum’s key objective is to maintain an
investment-grade rating and to strengthening its financial profile longer
term. Fortum maintains an active dialogue with credit rating agencies to
ensure understanding of Fortum’s strategy and planned measures which
target to achieve a financial and business profile that supports a solid
investment grade rating.

Currency and interest rate risks

Fortum’s debt portfolio consists of interest-bearing liabilities and
derivatives on a fixed- and floating-rate basis with differing maturity
profiles. Fortum manages the duration of the debt portfolio through
use of different types of financing contracts and interest rate derivative
contracts such as interest rate swaps.

Fortum’s currency exposures are divided into transaction exposures
(foreign exchange exposures relating to contracted cash flows and
balance sheet items where changes in exchange rates will have an
impact on earnings and cash flows) and translation exposure (foreign
exchange exposure that arises when profits and balance sheets in
foreign entities are consolidated at the Group level). The main principle is
that material transaction exposures should be hedged while translation
exposures are not hedged, or are hedged selectively. An exception is
the Generation segment’s hedging of power sales in Sweden where
the currency component is currently not hedged. The main translation
exposures toward the EUR/RUB, EUR/SEK and EUR/NOK are monitored
continuously. Changes in these currency rates affect Fortum’s profit level
and equity when translating results and net assets to euros.

Counterparty and credit risks
Fortum is exposed to counterparty risk whenever there is a contractual
arrangement with an external counterparty including customers,
suppliers, partners, banks, clearing houses and trading counterparties.
Credit risk exposures relating to financial derivative instruments are
often volatile. The majority of commodity derivatives are exchange-traded
and cleared through clearing houses such as Nasdaq Clearing AB or
through clearing banks. During 2019, Nasdaq Clearing AB has continued
implementation of its risk management enhancement program in order
to reduce the risk of member defaults. In addition, the trend toward more
use of futures contracts instead of forward contracts is decreasing the
credit exposure toward clearing houses. Derivatives contracts are also
entered into directly with external counterparties and such contracts are
limited to high-credit-quality counterparties active on the financial or
commodity markets.

Due to the financing needs and management of liquidity, Fortum
has counterparty credit exposure toward a number of banks and
financial institutions. The majority of the exposure is to Fortum's key
relationship banks, which are highly creditworthy institutions, but also
includes exposure to the Russian financial sector in terms of deposits
with financial institutions as well as to banks that provide guarantees
for suppliers and contracting parties. Deposits in Russia have been
concentrated to the most creditworthy state-owned or controlled banks.
Credit risk exposures relating to customers is spread across a
wide range of industrial counterparties, small businesses and private
individuals over a range of geographic regions. The majority of exposure
is to the Nordic market, Poland and Russia. The risk of non-payment in
the electricity and heat sales business in Russia is higher than in the
Nordic market. In order to manage counterparty credit risk, Fortum has
routines and processes to identify, assess and control exposure. Credit
checks are performed before entering into commercial obligations
and exposure limits are set for larger individual counterparties.
Creditworthiness is monitored through the use of internal and external
sources so that mitigating actions can be taken when needed. Mitigating
actions include demanding collateral, such as guarantees, managing
payment terms and contract length, and the use of netting agreements.

Operational risks

Operational risks are unexpected events which can lead to negative
monetary, safety, environmental or reputational impacts as a result of
inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or equipment, or from
external events.

Systems and Process Risks

System and process risks are mainly caused by design failures or human
errors. Mitigation includes process automation, testing and education.
Process-related risks are assessed and controls for the most relevant
risks are defined and implemented as part of the internal controls
framework. IT-system risk management is based on an IT Service

Lifecycle Model, and related processes and practices which has been
developed using reference frameworks such as COBIT and ITIL. Business
continuity plans are in place for business critical processes.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment risks are primarily managed through
monitoring and maintenance planning. In addition, Fortum's industrial
assets are covered by a Group Master Policy covering property damage
and business interruption risks which mitigates the impact of internal and
external events should they occur.

Combined heat and power (CHP) and recycling and waste
Operational events at CHP and recycling and waste facilities, or in the
storage and transportation of fuels, waste and materials can lead to
physical damages, business interruption, and environmental, health

and safety and social impacts. Leakage and contamination of the
surrounding environment could lead to clean-up costs and third-party
liabilities. An explosion or fire at a facility could cause damages to the
plant or third-parties and lead to possible business interruption. These
risks are mitigated by condition monitoring, preventive maintenance and
other operational improvements as well as competence development of
personnel operating the plants. Furthermore, requirements for incoming
waste are clearly specified and samples are tested for selected waste
deliveries.

Hydro power

Operational events at hydro power generation facilities can lead to
physical damages, business interruptions, and third-party liabilities. A
long-term programme is in place for improving the surveillance of the
condition of dams and for securing the discharge capacity in extreme
flood situations. Third-party liabilities from dam failures are strictly
the plant owner's responsibility. Together with other hydro power
producers, Fortum has a shared dam liability insurance programme

in place that covers Finnish and Swedish dam failure liabilities up to
SEK 10,000 million.

Nuclear power

Fortum owns the Loviisa nuclear power plant, and has minority interests
in two Finnish and two Swedish nuclear power companies. At the Loviisa
power plant, the assessment and improvement of nuclear safety is a
continuous process performed under the supervision of the Radiation and
Nuclear Safety Authority of Finland (STUK).

Third-party liability relating to nuclear accidents is strictly the plant
operator's responsibility and must be covered by insurance. As the
operator of the Loviisa power plant, Fortum has a statutory liability
insurance policy of 600M SDR (Special Drawing Right) and the same type
of insurance policies are in place for the operators where Fortum has a
minority interest.

Wind and Solar

Fortum is involved in the construction, development and operations

of several wind and solar power production projects in the Nordics,
Russia and in India. Operational incidents during both construction and
operational phases can lead to accidents, delays in commissioning and
business interruption. These risks are mitigated as part of the project
planning and through maintenance and continuous training of personnel
involved in constructing and operating the plants.

Cyber and information security risks

Fortum’s business operations and customer related services are
dependent on well-functioning IT and information management systems
and processes. Due to the nature of the business, large amounts of data
are processed and used for decision-making, serving customers and in
internal and external communication and reporting. Securing information
and availability of the systems are essential for Fortum. Cyber security
risks, including risks related to information, operation technology (OT)
and digitalisation, are managed centrally by Corporate Security in
collaboration with Divisions and Corporate Functions, especially the
Business Technology function. The Group’s cyber security governance
model, instructions and procedures set requirements for managing and
mitigating cyber security risks.

The Business Technology function, other support functions and
outsourcing partners are responsible for identifying and mitigating
operational IT/OT security related risks as well as managing IT/OT security
incidents. Divisions are responsible for business continuity planning and
IT functions are responsible for IT service continuity.

Climate-related risks

Mitigating climate change, adapting to it and driving the transition

to a lower-carbon economy is an integral part of Fortum’s strategy.
Successfully managing climate-related risks and opportunities is a key
element in delivering on the strategy.

Management of climate-related risks is integrated into Fortum’s risk
management framework and follows the same governance and processes
as Fortum’s other material risk and uncertainties. Climate-related risks are
identified and assessed by the various business areas through an annual
bottom-up process. Risk owners are assigned for managing the risks and
they are regularly reported and followed-up in business area and division
management teams. In 2019, Fortum emphasized climate-related risks
as part of the process including a specific top-down review of climate-
related risks by Group experts. The key climate-related risks are reported
to FEM and the ARC as part of the annual review of material risks and
uncertainties for the Group.

Climate-related risks can be divided into two categories; transition
risks and physical risks. The identified physical risks are generally found
in the operational risk category whereas transition risks are generally
longer-term and part of the strategic risk category

Transition risks

Fortum’s strategy is to a large extent built on taking advantage of the
opportunities associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy and
successfully mitigating the risks. The transition to a low carbon economy
poses a number of strategic risks related to changes in energy and
climate policy and regulation, technology development and the business
environment in which Fortum operates. Additionally, Fortum’s brand

and reputation can be negatively impacted by changes in stakeholder
perception about Fortum’s ability to deliver on its strategy.

One of the key risks is that the transition develops faster and with
policy tools or technologies that have not been anticipated or planned for.
The key risks related to climate policy and regulation include the revision
of the EU targets for greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy and
energy efficiency leading to overlapping or inefficient mechanisms,
tighter restrictions on incineration and burning of various fuels and a
more regulated electricity market due to the increase in intermittent
renewable production. Fortum favours a market-based approach to
decarbonisation with CO; pricing as a key tool and clear criteria for
capacity remuneration. Fortum supports the use of waste and sustainable
biomass as part of the EU circular economy. Additionally, increased
flexibility in demand is needed to cope with the expected increase in
intermittent renewable production.

The transition to a low-carbon economy also poses risks if there
emerge new, disruptive technologies that create cheap sources of
flexibility or storage in the energy market. Additionally, if there is an
accelerated decline in the cost of renewable energy, it could decrease
the value of existing conventional power and heat generation assets.
Fortum continuously monitors technology development and invests into
a broad portfolio of innovative technologies. Fortum also monitors the
price development of renewables and evaluates both divestment and
investment opportunities to optimise the portfolio with the aim of lower
carbon emissions.

Climate-change may affect the demand and supply of energy products
due to consumer behaviour and changing weather patterns. This could
lead to, e.g. lower and more volatile electricity prices which negatively
affect the revenues of baseload generation assets. Energy efficiency
measures and warmer weather may also impact the demand for heating
to a larger extent than currently expected.

Stakeholder views on sustainability may lead to stricter demands
by shareholders. Stricter definitions of sustainable finance set by the
EU may also make it more difficult to access financing. Additionally,
there is a risk of increasing activity by NGOs which could affect key
stakeholder perception. Fortum’s investment in Uniper is currently
increasing the exposure to these risks. In order to mitigate these risks,
Fortum focuses on the sustainability impacts of strategy and business

decisions, communicating transparently about strategy implementation
to key stakeholders, ensuring a broad base of investors and flexibility in
financing including a diversified bond portfolio.

Physical risks

Fortum’s operations and assets are exposed to external events, the
frequency and magnitude of which may increase as a result of climate
change. Changes in precipitation, inflows and temperatures may affect
hydropower production as well as bioenergy supply and availability.
Intense storms with, e.g. flash floods could increase the risk of dam
breaches as well as causing local damages and production outages.
Warmer weather may also lead to a need for new cooling or process
water sources and extreme warm and dry summer periods could result

in forest fires which potentially damage assets or lead to grid outages
restricting power supply. Fortum adapts its operations to the changing
climate and takes it into consideration in production and maintenance
planning and in evaluating growth and investment projects. Climate
change scenarios are, e.g. taken into account in the long-term dam safety
investment program so that extreme flooding situations can be managed.
