ANNUAL
REPORT

Dear Shareholders,

The 2017 results show that we have achieved the goals laid out for the year,
and bear out the transformations we are making to our business.

First, we are replacing business in more volatile regions subject to exchange
rate difficulties with a greater presence in Europe, which now accounts
for around 70% of international operations. Second, we have intensified
our focus on specialized products and services as a solid leverage to the
digitalization of our customers’ businesses - you can learn about some of
the solutions at www.novabase.com.

We have achieved this through major R&D investments and methodologies
centered on people, such as design thinking and gamification. We have
also used these types of approaches successfully within the company, with
NOVA being just one example. Developed by Novabase, this platform will
accelerate the development of our employees - mostly millennials - and
give us an advantage in a market which has become extremely competitive
in terms of technology talent.

The major changes in EBITDA and Net Profits, +85% and -50% respectively,
are due to the unusual circumstances of 2016: extraordinary costs from a
project, and capital gains from the sale of the Infrastructures & Managed
Services business. The latter also resulted in a record year for cash
generation: more than €31 million. Without it (€41 million), and without
dividends paid (€-20 million), the cash generated was €10 million.

Novabase renewed its appraisal of Maturity Level 3 in the Capability Maturity
Model Integration (CMMI), keeping us in the restrict group of companies in
Portugal that have this certification. The CMMI is the international benchmark
that measures the maturity and capacity of an organization’s processes,
certifying its expertise in product and service development in the areas
of systems and software engineering. Novabase has signed a strategic
partnership with Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) to support the transfer
of knowledge and innovation. Celfocus and Novabase Business Solutions
achieved respectively the first and second place, in the Innovation Services
category, in the ranking published by Star Company magazine for the 1000
largest companies operating in Portugal. Collab has been awarded the Gold
Award in Global Technology by Associa¢ao Portuguesa de Contact Centres
(Portuguese Association of Contact Centres).

2017 was once again a year of investment in innovation and dissemination
of Novabase offerings in events with large exposure, namely: conference of
Gamification Europe, held in the UK, where Novabase presented its NOVA
platform; Platinum sponsor of the Receivables Finance International 2017
(RFIx) conference, held in London, the world’s main event in the area of
factoring, that bring together financial institutions, technology innovators;
Celfocus presented its Celfocus Omnichannel solution at the Mobile World

Conference, which is considered the most important telecommunications
trade show worldwide; Partner of Web Summit 2017, where we presented
the Wizzio Digital Platform; Participation in the APDC Congress, whose
central theme was the transformation of the businesses in order to meet the
digital demand, where Novabase presented our most innovative solutions.

With regard to new companies, in the Venture Capital area, it was decided
to establish a new venture capital fund ‘Novabase Capital + Inova¢ao’, with
a total capital of 7 M€. The referred fund is held in 53.1% by Novabase
Capital SCR, S.A. and 46.9% by Fundo de Capital e Quase Capital (FC&QC).
Through this Fund, Novabase Capital intends to respond to the constraints
on SME financing in the ICT market and to contribute to the stimulation
and orientation of business investment and job creation, in line with the
investment objectives and priorities defined in the Portugal 2020. We sold
part of our investment in the company Feedzai, to the North American
companies Sapphire Ventures and Sapphire Sap, obtaining a 3 M€ gain.
Feedzai works in the area of data science and is one of the fintechs in the
list of Forbes for 2018.

Over the course of the year we hired more than 100 newly graduated
students through Novabase Academy, a program that selects the best talent
out of universities. Since its creation in 2006, we have already integrated
more than 1,200 young talents into our workforce.

The year was also marked by Novabase’s return to the PSI20, giving its
stock more visibility. Novabase nearly tripled its transaction volume in 2017,
which was up 48%, including the two dividends paid.

Given the strong balance sheet of the company, we will propose a dividend
payment of 15 cents per share at the 2018 General Meeting of Shareholders,
corresponding nearly to a 100% payout and yield of around 5%.

We will continue to pursue our business transformations in 2018, both from
the standpoint of geographically diversifying risk as well as investing in
products and services. In the short term, this decision will limit our growth

and profitability; however, we believe it will enable future access to higher-
quality, more sustainable business.

NOVABASE
ANNUAL
REPORT

Novabase is a listed Company since July 2000, working in compliance with
a governance model regularly assessed by the Executive Board in terms
of adequacy and performance, aiming at contributing to the performance
optimization and to a more accurate alignment with all the stakeholders’
interests. The stakeholders are entities whose interests involve the corporate
activity and include Shareholders and Investors, Clients, Suppliers and
other Business Partners, and Employees.

Given the growing challenges presented by the internationalization and
competiveness of Novabase’s activities, it became necessary to update the
corporate governance implemented in the Company, in order to simplify
and promote flexibility on the Company’s bodies and procedures and to
better adjust the existing solutions to the Company’s size and operating
circumstances.

Therefore, at the General Meeting held on 29 April, 2015, Novabase
changed its Articles of Association and implemented a reinforced Latin
governance model, which integrates a Board of Directors, an Audit Board
and an Effective Chartered Accountant. In the context of this model, a more
agile daily company management structure was implemented, including
two managing directors - Luis Paulo Cardoso Salvado (CEO) and Francisco
Paulo Figueiredo Morais Antunes (CFO). On the other hand, Novabase
has a General Meeting board elected for three-year mandates, as well as a
Remuneration Committee appointed by the General Meeting that shall set
the remuneration of each member of the Corporate Bodies, considering
their duties and the Companies’ economic situation. The Company also
appoints a Secretary and a deputy secretary, in accordance with article
446-A of the Commercial Companies Code, to exercise their competences
under the law.

Novabase continuously analyses the implementation of this model, to
improve, wherever possible, its corporate governance practices and better
adjust the adopted model to the demands and challenges faced by the
Company.

Depreciation and amortisation reached -3.2 M€, an increase towards the
amount registered in 2016 (-3.8 M€).

Operating Profit (EBIT) was 7.7 M€, rising 263% compared to 2016 (2.1 M€).

The Financial results were negative in 0.8 M€, an increase of 0.2 M€
compared to 2016.

Earnings Before Taxes (EBT) in 2017 were 7.8 M€, registering a 569%
increase compared to 1.2 M€ in 2016.

The Gain on net monetary position, amounting to 1.0 M€, derives from
the application of IAS 29 to the financial statements of the subsidiary in
Angola, after this economy was considered at the end of December 2017
as a hyperinflationary economy, in accordance with that standard. The
calculated gain considers an inflation rate of 23.7% in Angola in 2017.

Results from discontinued operations reached a 2.7 M€ profit, which
compares to 12.9 M€ in 2016, and correspond to the results attributable
to IMS segment. In 2017, this value corresponds fully to the adjustment
on the gain generated by the sale of the business, resulting from the final
calculation of working capital and net debt, as established in the purchase
and sale agreement.

Cash In 2017, Novabase shows a positive evolution in cash generation, with a 31.1
Mé€ increase in the cash position in 2017. Thus, Novabase ended 2017 with
56.8 M€ in net cash, which compares to 25.7 M€ in 2016. This evolution
mainly reflects the cash inflow from IMS Business disposal, in the amount
of 41.1 M€.

ANNUAL
REPORT

At the end of the year, the total number of employees was 1991, compared
with 2138 at the end of 2016.

Worthy of note is that international employees represent 10% of the total
number in 2017 (211), and the recruitment of 97 new university graduates
through Novabase Academy program.

The 2017 results are aligned with the expectations laid out for the year and
reflect the changes outlined for business.

In the new perimeter, Turnover increased by 3%, with the weight of the
international business accounting for 54% of the total. Operations in
Europe, which consolidated its leadership as the major market, represent
69% of non-domestic activity. Likewise, an improvement of operating
competitiveness was verified, with EBITDA rising 85% up to 10.9 M€ and
Net Profit reaching 4.8 M€.

Towards the Guidance, the 2017 results stood in line in Turnover and above
in EBITDA (+9% in absolute terms and +0.7% in percentage points). In terms
of international business weight, Novabase was below the 60% target,
influenced by the domestic business growth.

We highlight in 2017, in the Venture Capital segment, that Collab has been
awarded the Gold Award in Global Technology by Associacaéo Portuguesa
de Contact Centres (Portuguese Association of Contact Centres). The award

FINANCIAL AND STOCK


--- Page 17 ---

was announced at the 13th International Conference of the association, an
event that brings together the Portuguese contact centre industry.

In the Business Solutions area, Celfocus and Novabase Business Solutions
achieved the leadership of the Innovation - Services category, in the ranking
published by Star Company magazine for the 1000 largest companies
operating in Portugal, occupying the first and second place, respectively.

Additionally, Novabase renewed its appraisal of Maturity Level 3 in the CMMI
(Capability Maturity Model Integration) model in Portugal. This international
benchmark measures the maturity and capacity of an organization’s
processes, certifying its expertise in product and service development in
the areas of systems and software engineering. This appraisal, once again
given by the Spanish consultant PROQUA, keeps Novabase in the élite
group of certified software companies headquartered in Portugal.

With regard to new partnerships, Novabase has signed a protocol with
Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) to join its network of strategic partners.
This agreement will allow Novabase to support the transfer of knowledge
and innovation, resulting from the research activity of the University to the
Industry and vice versa, and fall under Novabase’s strategy to specialise its
offerings and make them more suitable for the most sophisticated markets.

Highlights also include the re-entry of Novabase to the main index of
the Lisbon stock exchange. The return to PSI20O increases the visibility of
Novabase and may lead to an increase of the liquidity of its stock, which
recorded a 48% appreciation during the year, after adjusting the regular
and extraordinary dividends paid in 2017.

2017 was also a year of investment in innovation and dissemination of
Novabase offerings in events with large exposure, namely:

* Novabase participated in the conference of Gamification Europe, aimed at
those who use gamification to encourage behavioural change within their
companies. The conference was launched in the UK and was attended by
the largest gamification specialists, where Novabase presented its NOVA
project, a plataform for promoting the growth of Novabase’s employees;

* Novabase was the platinum sponsor of the Receivables Finance
International 2017 (RFLx) conference, held in London, the world’s main
event in the area of factoring, that bring together financial institutions,
technology innovators, companies and specialists for an in-depth
discussion on the industry’s future;

* Celfocus presented its Celfocus Omnichannel solution at the Mobile World
Conference, which is considered the most important telecommunications
trade show worldwide;

the transformation of the businesses in order to meet the digital demand.
Novabase unveiled its innovative methodologies such as Gamification
and Design Thinking.

These world reference events reflect Novabase’s focus on innovation and
provide excellent showcases for the dissemination of its offerings.

With regard to new companies, in the Venture Capital area, it was decided
to establish a new venture capital fund ‘Novabase Capital + Inova¢ao’, with
a total share capital of 7 M€. The referred fund is held in 53.1% by Novabase
Capital SCR, S.A. and 46.9% by Fundo de Capital e Quase Capital (FC&QC).

Risks The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, namely,

NOVABASE
ANNUAL
REPORT

Foreign exchange risk, Interest rate risk (Cash flows and fair value), Credit
risk, Liquidity risk and Capital management risk.

The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredicta-
bility of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects
on the Group’s financial performance.

More information on each of the financial risks that Novabase is exposed
to, listed below, including control mechanisms and sensitivity analysis, can
be found in the note “Financial Risk Management Policy” included in the
Accounts, which forms an integral part of this Consolidated Report and
Accounts.

a) Foreign exchange risk

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk,
mainly arising from U.S. Dollar, Kwanza and Metical exposures, since some
subsidiaries perform transactions in these currencies.

The finance department is responsible for monitoring the evolution of
the exchange rate of the currencies mentioned above, in order to reduce
the impact of their fluctuations in consolidated results. The group uses
derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.

b) Interest rate risk (Cash flows and fair value)

Interest rate risk reflects the possibility of changes in future interest charges
in loans obtained as a result of changes in market interest rate levels.

Novabase Group’s financial liabilities are indexed to short-term reference
interest rates, revised in periods shorter than one year plus duly negotiated
risk spreads. Hence, changes in interest rates can impact the Group’s
earnings.

The Group’s exposure to interest rates is related to financial liabilities
contracted with a fixed and/or floating rate. In the first case, the Group

FINANCIAL AND STOCK



--- Page 25 ---

faces a risk of fair value variation in these assets or liabilities, since every
change in market rates involves an opportunity cost. In the second case,
such change has a direct impact on interest value, consequently causing
cash variations.

Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored continuously by the finance
department. The purpose of managing interest rate risk is to reduce the
volatility of financial costs in the income statement.

c) Credit Risk

Credit risk is managed, simultaneously, on business unit’s level, for the
amounts of outstanding trade and other receivables, and on Group basis,
for financial instruments. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents,
derivative financial instruments, and deposits with banks and financial
institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers,
including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. For
banks and financial institutions, only independently well rated parties are
accepted. Credit risk management of trade and other receivables is based
in credit limits, taking into account the financial position of the customer
and past experience.

d) Liquidity risk

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and
marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate
amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to
close out market positions.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve
(which comprises undrawn committed borrowing facilities and cash and
cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows, taking into account
the analysis of the remaining contractual maturity of the financial liabilities
and the expected date of financial assets inflows, and taking into account
the cash transfer restrictions from Angola. Additionally, the maturity
concentration of derivate financial instruments, borrowings and liabilities
of the Group are regularly monitored.

e) Capital management risk

The Group’s objectives when managing capital, which is a broader concept
than ‘equity’ in the consolidated statement of financial position, are:

* To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;

* To maintain a solid capital structure to support the development of its
business;

* To maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The 2017 results are in line with the strategic objectives set for the year.

The international activity accounts for 54% of the total business, and Europe
consolidates its position as the major market, representing 69% of total. In
this period, EBITDA margin reached 7.8% and Net Profit was 3.4%.

In 2018, Novabase will continue the transformations to its business, both
from the standpoint of geographically diversifying risk as well as investing
in products and services. In the short term, this strategy limits growth and
profitability, but Novabase believes that it will enhance future access to
higher-quality, more sustainable business.

The following relevant facts occurred in 2018 by the date of issue of this
report, details of which have been adequately disclosed as privileged
information via the Novabase SGPS and CMVM sites, or are public
knowledge:

Novabase informed the intention of the Board of Directors to propose, at the
2018 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the distribution of 4.7 Million
Euros to shareholders. This payment, equal to 98.7% of the consolidated
net profit, represents a dividend of 15 Euro cents per share.

As part of the annual review of the national stock exchange index, Euronext
- the managing entity of the Lisbon stock exchange - announced in a news
item dated from March 6, 2018, that Novabase will leave the main index of
the Lisbon Stock Exchange, PSI20, from March 19, where it was trading since
March 20, 2017. The PSI20 index is revised quarterly in June, September
and December, with the full annual review taking place in March ”.

--- Page 30 ---

In 2017, Novabase SGPS, SA had a consolidated net profit of €4,773,954.51
(four million, seven hundred and seventy three thousand, nine hundred
and fifty four euros and fifty one cents) and a net profit of €16,995,280.48
(sixteen million, nine hundred and ninety five thousand, two hundred and
eighty euros and forty eight cents) in the individual accounts.

In compliance with the provisions of law and the articles of association, 5%
of the net profit for the year should be added to the statutory reserves until
this balance reaches 20% of the share capital.

The individual statement of financial position of the Company, reported
as at december 31, 2017, presents statutory reserves in the amount of
€3,140,139.40 (three million, one hundred and forty thousand, one hundred
and thirty nine euros and forty cents). This amount is equal to the minimum
legally required, not becoming, on the other hand, as a result of the intended
allocation of profits, the total equity inferior to the sum of the capital and
reserves which may not be distributed to shareholders by the law or the
contract.

On 22 february 2018, the company’s Board of Directors informed on its
intention to propose, at the 2018 annual General Meeting of shareholders,
the distribution of €4.710 Million, corresponding to annual profits to be
distributed by means of a resolution to allocate profits. This distribution,
equal to 98.7% Of the consolidated net profit, will represent a dividend of
€0.15 per share.

Pursuant to legal and statutory provisions, the Board of Directors proposes
that the financial year individual net profit be allocated as follows:

1. From the net profit for the year above mentioned, an amount totaling
€4,710,209.10 (four million, seven hundred and ten thousand, two hundred
and nine euros and ten cents) is paid to shareholders, corresponding to
€0.15 (fifteen euro cents) per share, as related to the total number of
shares issued;

2. That, as it is not possible to accurately determine the number of own

shares held in treasury on the date of the abovementioned payment
without limiting the Company’s intervention capacity, notably in the
increase of liquidity in its securities, the overall sum of €4,710,209.10
(four million, seven hundred and ten thousand, two hundred and nine
euros and ten cents) as provided for in the foregoing paragraph, based
on an unit amount per issued share (in this case, €0.15), Be distributed
as follows:

a) that the unit amount of €0.15 be paid to each issued share;
b) that the unit amount corresponding to the own shares held in treasury

on the date of payment as referred to above not be paid, but transferred
to retained earnings.

. The remainder of net profit for the financial year in the amount of

€12,285,071.38 (twelve million, two hundred and eighty five thousand,
seventy one euros and thirty eight cents) is transferred to retained
earnings.

ANNUAL
REPORT

For the purposes of article 508-G of the Commercial Companies Code,
in the wording introduced by Decree-Law No. 89/2017, of 28 July, which
transposed Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and Council,
of 22 October 2014, to the Portuguese Law, Novabase explicitly states
in this [annex] the “sufficient information for the understanding of the
progress, performance, position, and impact of the group’s activities, at
least, with regard to environmental, social and work-related issues, to
equality between men and women, non-discrimination, respect for human
rights, fight against corruption and bribery attempts” concerning Novabase
Group in the financial year ended 31 December 2017.

Information on the business activity and organization of Novabase
Group can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended 31
December 2017, Section 1. General Information), as well as in the Report
on the Governance Practices for the financial year 2017 (Part |, Section B.,
Point 21).

Considering the dimension of Novabase Group, the nature of the activities
pursued, the business model implemented and the industries in which
the Group operates, no formal policies were approved regarding all the
aspects listed in number 2, of article 508-G of the Commercial Companies
Code. However, Novabase Group is governed in the different aspects of
its activity by the applicable law and by the applicable regulations and
recommendations of the Portuguese Securities Market Commission and
other national and international entities. Novabase Group also adopted
internally certain reference documents, systems and due diligence
processes with regard to the practices to be adopted in certain areas,
taking into account the Group and its needs, as well as its employees,
professionals and other stakeholders, with the goal, in particular, to ensure
sustainable growth. Novabase Group companies are also subject to internal
and external audits of a different nature.

In this context, we highlight below the main aspects, practices and processes
in Novabase Group which the Group considers as having an impact on non-
financial issues relevant to the Group, namely environmental, social, labour-
related, gender equality and non-discrimination, human rights and fight
against corruption issues:

* Novabase’s activity and the conduct of its employees and professionals
is governed by the law applicable in the relevant jurisdictions and by the
Novabase Code of Conduct (published on the corporate website), which is
an internally approved document that has been in force since 2011 with the
objective of guiding the conduct of the Novabase professionals according
to the values supported by the Group, not only in its relationships with
customers, but also with each other.

NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT 4 3


--- Page 39 ---

Results
and Key

Indicators

NOVABASE
ANNUAL
REPORT

* The company’s activity is managed according to the Integrated
Management System.

Novabase companies are audited by their financial auditors and their
Quality (ISO 9001), Environmental Management (ISO 14001) and Health
and Safety at Work (OHSAS 18001) certifications are renewed on an
annual basis after internal and external audits, the latter being conducted
by certifying bodies.

The company regularly monitors its customer’ satisfaction, as well as
its employees and professionals satisfaction with regard to the internal
services and other topics of interest to the management.

In compliance with the recommendations of the Portuguese Securities
Market Commission on the Governance of Listed Companies and with
the objective of fostering a responsible and compliant culture, Novabase
has adopted a system to report irregular practices (known as “SPI”) that
may have occurred within the Group. The reporting of irregular practices
through the SPI is addressed to one of the members of the Auditing
Committee specially appointed to this position.

Although in 2017 Novabase does not have a formally approved diversity
policy (the policy on the diversity in the administrative and supervisory
bodies of S.G.P.S. S.A. was approved during the financial year 2018),
the company is committed to the promotion of this aspect and the
compliance with the applicable law with this regard. This effort is visible
not only in the intentions of some shareholders, disclosed to the market
during the financial year 2017 with regard to the proposal to be submitted
to the General Meeting for the appointment of the governing bodies of
Novabase S.G.P.S. S.A. for the 2018-2020 mandate - according to which
the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee of this company
shall have, at least, 25% of members of each gender - as well as in the
improvement of the results of the key indicator related to this aspect,
indicated in the following section.

* The company also has an “Internal Regulation on Business with Holders
of Qualified Participation in Novabase, SGPS, S.A.” in force.

In the financial year 2017 no occurrence related to human rights, corruption
and bribery attempts was reported to Novabase SGPS, S.A. Board through
the channels available for this purpose and, therefore, there are no indicators
to report on this regard.

As for gender equality, the key indicator taken into account is that of the
proportion of men and women in the total number of employees, which
should tend to be balanced. This indicator has evolved positively (from
72% of men and 28% of women in 2016 to 70% of men and 30% of women

in 2017), this gender unbalance following the trend of the information
technology industry, in Portugal and abroad, which also reflects the
choices of higher education courses by gender. In effect, in courses such as
Computer Engineering, Electronic Engineering or Network Engineering, the
number of graduates (men) is much higher than the number of graduates
(women).

In turn, the key indicator related to environmental issues taken into
account is the number of non-conformities identified in the annual
audit of the Environmental Management System as a consequence of
1SO01400 1 certification. In 2017, as in 2016, the companies in the Novabase
group had no-conformities under 15014001 standard.

Other (operational, non-key) indicators monitored with regard to these
topics include:

* Business: Investment in Research, Development and Innovation; Customer
Satisfaction.

* Employee-related: Number of training actions, participants and hours;
number of accidents at work; number of recent graduates received
through the Novabase Academy integration program.

* Environment-related: consumption of electricity, thermal energy, water
and diesel & gasoline; plastics recycling, cardboard & paper, glass;
greenhouse gas emissions.

Novabase Group is subject to normal market risks and to the specific risks of
the activities it pursues. Novabase does not consider that the risks inherent
to the issues addressed in this document are emphasized due to the type
of activity pursued by the Group or the industries in which it operates.

Novabase also has internal control procedures and systems aimed at,
namely, prevent and manage risks in the context of its organization and
activities. Additional information with regard to Novabase’s internal control
and risk management can be found in Part |, Section III. “Internal Control
and Risk Management” of the Report on Corporate Governance Practices
for the financial year 2017.
