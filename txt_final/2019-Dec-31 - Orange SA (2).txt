Overview
1.1.4 History
Orange, formerly France Télécom, is France’s incumbent

‘elecommunications operator. The Group has its origins in the Ministry
‘or Mail, Telegraphs and Telephone, later to become the General
Directorate of Telecommunications, which in 1990 was accorded the
status of independent public entity and, on January 1, 1991, renamed
France Télécom. On December 31, 1996, France Télécom became a
société anonyme (limited company). In October 1997, France Télécom
shares were listed on the Paris and New York stock exchanges,
allowing the French government the disposal of 25% of its shares to
he public and Group employees. Subsequently, the public sector
gradually reduced its holding to 53%. The law of December 31, 2003
authorized the transfer of the Company to the private sector and
between 2004 and 2008 the public sector sold a further 26% of the
capital, and then again 4% in 2014 and 2015. On December 31, 2019,
he French State retained 22.95% of the share capital, held either
directly or jointly with Bpifrance Participations.

France Télécom’s area of activity and its regulatory and competitive
environment have undergone significant changes since the 1990s. In
a context of increased deregulation and competition, the Group has,
over that period, undertaken several strategic investments, in particular
he acquisition of the mobile operator Orange Plc and its brand created
in 1994, and the acquisition of acontrolling stake in Poland’s incumbent
operator, Telekomunikacja Polska.

Since 2005, the Group has expanded strategically in Spain by acquiring
he mobile operator Amena, then in 2015 the fixed-line operator
Jazztel.

Over the last twelve years, the Group has pursued a policy of selective,
value-creating acquisitions by concentrating on the markets in which
it is already present. Mainly targeting the emerging markets of Africa
and the Middle East where the Group is historically present (in particular
Cameroon, Céte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Jordan, Mali and Senegal), this
strategy was implemented through the acquisition of Mobinil in Egypt
(2010) and of Méditel in Morocco (2015) and more recently by the
acquisition of a number of African operators (in Liberia, Burkina Faso,
Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) (2016).

It also resulted in the joint venture with Deutsche Telekom that combined

UK activities under the EE brand (2010) followed by the disposal of
EE in 2016, as well as the disposal of Orange Suisse (2012), Orange
Dominicana (2014), Orange Armenia (2015) and Telkom Kenya (2016).

As part of its corporate services and since the acquisition of Equant
in 2000, Orange has been pursuing its strategy of becoming a global
player in digital transformation and has accelerated its shift to services
hrough a number of targeted acquisitions, notably in the fields of
cyber security and Cloud services, such as those of Business &
Decision and Basefarm in 2018 and SecureLink and SecureData in
2019.

Business diversification is one of the major pillars of Orange’s strategy.
The acquisition of Groupama Banque, now Orange Bank, in 2016,
which launched its new banking offer in November 2017, illustrates
he goal of diversifying into the mobile financial services sector.

n 2006, Orange became the Group’s main brand for Internet, television
and mobile telephony services in the majority of countries where it
operated, most importantly France and Spain. In 2013, the Company
adopted the Orange name, offering the full range of its telephony
services in France under the Orange brand. This policy continued with
the adoption of the Orange brand by Telekomunikacja Polska in 2018,
by Mobinil in Egypt, Mobistar in Belgium and Méditel in Morocco in
2016, and by several of the Group’s subsidiaries in Africa in 2017.
Corporate services in the world are offered primarily under the brand
Orange Business Services.

In December 2019, the Group presented its new strategic plan, Engage
2025, which looks to reinvent its operator model, guided by exemplary
social and environmental conduct. For more information on Orange’s
strategic plan and its business model, see Section 1.2 Market, strategy
and business model.

1.2.1

The digital services market is a subsector of the broader Information
and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. It combines IT services
and software, telecoms services, digital content TV and video services,
and Internet services. On the other hand, it does not include network
equipment" and devices which are intermediate goods that
automatically form part of the added value. The digital services market
is an essential component of economic growth and accounts for
significant value creation via the distribution of new services and new
uses.

With growth of 5.1% in 2019, the global digital services market amounts
to €3,527 billion and is continuing to grow steadily. The growth of this
market is driven by the dynamic Internet services sector (up 13.7% in
2019) and IT (up 7.3%) and digital content (up 4.2%). Revenue from
telecoms services stagnated at €1,171 billion (+0.1%)®. For a
presentation of the B2B global digital services market, see Section 1.4.5

Market growth by region

North America remains the top region in the world in the digital services
market with 35.3% of worldwide revenue, ahead of the Asia-Pacific
region which is catching up at 30.6%, driven by its economic and
industrial development. Europe comes next with 24.8% of the market
while Latin America (5.0%) and Africa & Middle East (4.3%) together
account for close to 10% of the worldwide market.

In Africa, the digital services market is estimated to have grown by
slightly more than 8% in 2019. With Africa accounting for 25% of the
world’s population in 2050, compared with 17% in 2020, the potential
of the Africa & Middle East region, where the Orange Group has a
strong presence, is huge: network deployment by operators is still
ongoing, the digital ecosystem is being constructed and is emerging
by adapting to local conditions to integrate information technologies
in all sectors of the economy (health, sales, agriculture, government,
mobile payment, etc.). Two-thirds of the population own a smartphone,
which will represent almost 700 million smartphones in circulation in
Sub-Saharan Africa in 2025, establishing Africa as a high-growth
region for connectivity and digital services (source: StatsSSA-

Market, strategy and business model

The global digital services market

Key social and environmental trends up to 2025

At the demographic level, a dramatic increase in the African population
is expected in the coming years as large numbers of young people
will reach adult age.

With the increase in the number of extreme weather and climatic
events, the immediate impacts of climate change have become more
tangible. The Tech industry, which uses a huge amount of data, is
directly concerned: the explosion in data use could consume close to
20% of the world’s electricity by 2025 (source: ICT Footprint EU,
European Framework Initiative for Energy & Environmental Efficiency
in the ICT Sector).

Moreover, by 2025, the major technological developments (Al, Data,
Cloud, 5G, etc.) that are transforming all industries will affect all
business lines: 65% of current students will have a job in 2025 that
does not yet exist (source: Les Echos, Dec. 10, 2018, based on a
study by Microsoft and The Future Laboratory). Hence companies
will face new challenges in terms of skills and expertise.

Key changes in telecoms services

Network development and growth
in telecommunication uses worldwide

While in Africa & the Middle East, Internet access networks are
developing mainly via the deployment of 4G mobile networks, in
Europe network investments concern very high-speed access, with
he development of fiber for landlines, the improvement of the
performance of 4G mobile networks and the first commercial 5G
launches. At the same time, operators are upgrading their networks
o make them more agile and simpler to manage (thanks to the
virtualization of network functions and automation).

Usage is continuing to grow under the combined effect of the
deployment of new networks, the increase in capacity of existing
networks and the penetration of smartphones. The dramatic rise in
nternet uses is mainly due to the development of video and Internet
services, accessible via multiple screens (computers, smartphones,
ablets, connected TVs). Moreover, the development of 5G technology
will enable the development of new uses, both for the general public
(immersive videos, Cloud gaming) and for businesses, for which 5G
will be a real disruption (optimization of production times, remote
control of machines, predictive maintenance, etc.).

Consumer and company expectations

Connectivity has become an imperative. Internet has become vital to
people for a wide range of services in daily life, and essential to
businesses for their development. Customers are becoming
increasingly more demanding as regards coverage and continuous
quality across the country.

In this context, consumers have strong expectations on the quality
and reliability of the communication networks, but also on the protection
of their personal data and on having a trusted relationship with their
operator. While customers are increasingly concerned about the use
of their data, cyber security is becoming a key issue for all: individuals,
businesses and governments. According to Gartner, the cyber-security

Notably: the network equipment of telecoms operators, the servers of IT companies, the production and broadcasting equipment of television industry players.

Forecast: Information Security and Risk Management, Feb. 2019)").

In addition to these expectations, society if placing increasingly strong
demands on businesses: more transparency, more commitments to
major environmental issues, more regional and territorial rooting.

Transformation of the telecoms industry

In this context, the telecoms industry is changing. OTT operators
continue to get a great return from the digital services that they offer
on the consumer and enterprise markets, becoming increasingly more
prominent in the field of communication services. Furthermore, the
large digital operators are developing their own infrastructures by

On December 4, 2019, Orange launched Engage 2025, its new
strategic plan looking forward to 2025. This new growth plan follows
on from the Essentials2020 plan launched in 2015, which has enabled
Orange to generate revenue and EBITDA growth again.

The Orange group strategy

Engage 2025, which reconciles growth with responsibility, is guided
by exemplary social and environmental conduct and is based on four
ambitions:

1. Reinventing Orange’s operator model;

2. Accelerating in growth areas;

8. Placing data and Al at the heart of its innovation model;
4. Co-creating a future-facing company.

As announced at the Shareholders’ Meeting of May 21, 2019, the
Group has also adopted a Purpose, unveiled on the occasion of the
launch of the Engage 2025 Plan:

“As a trusted partner, Orange gives everyone the keys to a responsible
digital world”.

The Group’s Purpose was co-developed with the support of all its
internal and external stakeholders: employees, employee representatives,
Board members, NGOs, customers, authorities, investors and opinion
leaders. It will be submitted for shareholders’ approval at the
Shareholders’ Meeting of May 19, 2020, then enshrined in Orange’s
Articles of Association. For more information, see chapter 4 Non-financial
performance, Section The Purpose of Orange.

A strong commitment guided by social
and environmental responsibility

The Group wants to foster a business model that is committed and
accountable to its employees, its customers and society as a whole.

Commitment to inclusion

Of the 4 billion people worldwide who do not have Internet access,
8.2 billion are covered by networks but do not use Internet, either
because they do not have the means to do so or because they have
not received any training. The digital divide is therefore not just a
question of network coverage. In addition to its ambitions for the digital
coverage of territories, Orange undertakes to train and support the
digitally excluded so that everybody can reap the benefits of the digital
revolution. By 2025, it is Orange’s aim to open an Orange Digital
Center in all the regions where the Group is present and in its operational
divisions in France, to offer packages for low income households in
Europe — like the coup de pouce in France and gigas solidarios in
Spain, and to pursue its efforts to offer increasingly affordable
smartphones in Africa & the Middle East.

Market, strategy and business model

building Data centers and international networks. These infrastructures,
which were initially built for their own needs, are now also promoted
on the enterprise and wholesale markets.

At the same time, European operators must invest massively in
networks of the future to meet the increasing demand for connectivity,
against the backdrop of intense competition and stringent regulatory
requirements. This imposes a significant financial constraint on the
entire industry, leading operators to make structuring decisions in their
choice of telecoms infrastructure. In order to better capitalize on them,
operators have to further share their networks, and even sell part or
all of their infrastructure to financial funds and/or to infrastructure
companies.

Environmental commitment

In response to the challenge of climate change, the Group has set the
goal of meeting the GSMA targets 10 years earlier by being carbon
neutral by 2040, in spite of the huge surge in data on networks. To
achieve this, it will increasingly use renewable energies, which should
represent over 50% of its electricity mix by 2025, and unprecedented
efforts in terms of energy efficiency. To reduce its network energy
consumption, Orange also plans to reinforce its Green ITN program,
ensure a 10-fold increase in the number of electrified vehicles in France
and rely more on the circular economy with, for example, eco-designed
products, second-hand network equipment and more second-hand
terminals available in its stores.

For more information, see Section 2.2.4.4.1 Orange’s environmental
commitment.

The telecoms industry is changing. The Group will thus rethink its
operator model in Europe, by looking for new sources of differentiation

On the fixed network, whether through its own infrastructure or the
use of third-party networks, Orange aims to sell its FTTH packages to
more than 65 million households in Europe by 2028, to assert its
leadership position in Europe in fiber. At the same time, Orange will

‘| — Overview of the Group and of its business

Market, strategy and business model

November 2019, the Group aims to start 5G deployment in 2020 in
most of the European countries where the Group has a presence.
Once it has been launched, 5G will allow for up to 10 times faster
connection speeds. From 2028, when the core networks will move to
5G, Orange aims to offer lower latency and to implement network
slicing, i.e. prioritizing certain network slices to cover critical usage or
specific needs. The technical performance of the 5G technology will
enable the emergence of many new uses, both for the general public
(immersive videos, Cloud gaming) and for businesses for which 5G
will be a catalyst of digital transformation (optimization of production
times, remote control of machines, predictive maintenance, etc.).
Orange has already started to co-design these future uses with its
B2B customers and aims to inaugurate an open co-innovation center
in Chatillon in 2020 dedicated to new 5G uses.

To reinvent its business model, Orange also aims to optimize, develop
and derive greater value from its infrastructure, while always keeping
control over its strategic assets.

For FTTH, Orange will continue to invest in its own infrastructures, in
order to fulfill its commitments outside of very densely populated
areas, in France for example (see Section 1.3 Significant events).
However, to continue its industrial effort in certain areas, while
controlling its investments, Orange could link up with partners. Thanks
‘0 the pooling, under Orange Concessions, of the 4 million connections
of the Public Initiative Networks (PIN) that belong to local authorities
and for which Orange is the concession holder, Orange may seize
potential opportunities for growth or consolidation of its position on
his market. In Spain and Poland, Orange also plans to share future
FTTH deployments with other operators via FiberCos, potentially
involving third-parties.

At the same time, Orange will continue to optimize its copper network
in France, very gradually, so as to support all network users in their transition
0 fiber. After an initial experimental phase, the decommissioning of
copper will begin in 2023 and is expected to end in 2030.

To optimize the deployment of its mobile infrastructure, particularly in
5G, in terms of pace, coverage and financial capacity, Orange plans
0 rely on RAN-sharing agreements, while maintaining areas of
differentiation, in keeping with the agreements already existing in
Poland and Romania, and those signed in 2019 in Spain and Belgium
(see Section 1.3 Significant events).

At the same time, to optimize the directly owned 40,000 towers of its
mobile network in Europe, Orange will create in most European
countries TowerCos, i.e. entities dedicated to the management of
owers, with three key objectives: improving operational efficiency and
optimizing mobile investments, increasing the co-location rate, while
maintaining Orange’s competitive advantage, and finally ensuring
better understanding of and highlighting the quality and value of these
assets. Orange plans to retain control of these entities in all European
countries where they are created. The first works are scheduled in
2020 in France and in Spain. Eventually, the merger of all or part of
hese local TowerCos, under a European TowerCo, in which Orange
will retain majority control, will be considered in order to seize
opportunities for consolidation of the tower market at the European
level.

Accelerating its development in three areas of growth:
Africa & Middle East, B2B services and financial
services.

Making Orange the benchmark digital operator in Africa &
Middle East

With a presence of more than 20 years in Africa & Middle East, Orange
has significantly developed its activities there: in 10 years, the Africa

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

& Middle East region more than doubled its share of the Group’s
revenue. Orange aims to become the benchmark digital operator in
Africa & Middle East.

To achieve this, the Group will firstly leverage the growth of mobile data
driven by the rise in the smartphone penetration rate and 4G
deployment. In 2020, Orange will thus have deployed 4G in almost all
countries and will use RAN-sharing agreements and innovative
echnologies (lighter masts for example) to extend its coverage in the
rural areas. Moreover, Orange aims to reinforce its multi-service
strategy. The target is that multi-services will account for 20% of the
region’s revenue by 2025. In financial services, Orange Money aims
‘0 generate about 900 million euros of revenue in 2023 and, at the
same time, continue to develop its offers of contents, e-health and
energy. The Group’s target for the period 2020-2023 is an annual
growth rate of its revenue of about 5% across the region.

Accelerating the development of IT services for B2B
customers and scale up cyber security

With Essentials2020,
which now accounts

he Group is well on track in its shift to IT services,
or 1/3 of its B2B revenue. To address the surge

in the demand from businesses for on-demand and virtualized

connectivity services (
the transformation of
to take advantage of

such as SD-WAN), Orange intends to accelerate
its B2B business. The Group aims to continue
he convergence of telco/IT businesses, and to

maintain its connectivity leadership by focusing on network
virtualization, fiber and 5G. At the same time, Orange aims to continue
its development in integration services to offer a comprehensive IT
ecosystem to its customers: data analytics to support companies in
their digital transformation; Cloud services and in the near future, edge
computing, a key foundation for the digital revolution underway, and
smart mobility and loT to deliver on all the promises of 5G and edge
computing.

Lastly, cyber security is a growth sector where Orange’s presence is
expected and has a legitimate place, with the Group’s control over
networks representing a decisive advantage due to its capacity to
detect weak signals of attacks. The Group aims to exceed €1 billion
in revenue and to be the European leader in this area in 2023.

The Group’s target is that more than half of its revenue in the Enterprise
segment come from new connectivity services (SD-WAN, 5G) and IT
services in 2023.

Continuing its expansion in financial services across its
footprint

The Group aims to capitalize on the success of Orange Bank in
European countries, and of Orange Money in Africa where demand in
countries with limited banking access is very strong.

With over 500,000 customers at the end of 2019, Orange Bank aims
to launch its offer by 2025 in all European countries where the Group
is present. The launch of banking services such as micro-credit is also
planned in Africa & Middle East in 2020 in order to extend the range
of services already offered by Orange Money. Capitalizing on the
success of offers combining banking and telecoms (device financing,
cash back on in-store purchases, etc.), Orange Bank will seek to
develop new products around payment, credit and insurance and is
working on a specific digital banking offer for professionals and small
businesses. Orange Bank aims to break even in Europe towards the
end of 2028, with nearly 5 million customers and around €400 million
in net banking income. Orange Bank Africa aims for nearly 10 million
customers by 2023 with an NBI of about €100 million.

The Group’s growth will also be based on its historic
business lines:

= in France, services revenue is expected to experience moderate
grow in the 2020-2023 period, mainly due to increased penetration
of fiber and mobile services (6G), which secures market shares and
encourages the acquisition of new customers;

= Spainaims to return to growth in 2021, with an increasingly optimized
use of its brands in order to capture their full potential value and an
increase in B2B and wholesale, excluding activities with international
operators;

= Europe targets growth thatis better than the market average in each
of its six countries, driven in particular by strong commercial
momentum on convergence thanks to the deployment of very
high-speed fixed broadband.

Crossing a new milestone in its digital transformation by
placing Al and data at the heart of its innovation model.

Orange seeks to use these new technologies to reinvent customer
experience, by combining digital and human interactions, to offer a
customer experience that is simple, expert and responsible. The Group
will deploy 100% digital pathways and streamline its distribution
network, which will remain essential for customer proximity and for
marketing new services. Al and data will be used to to provide more
personalized offers, leading to greater satisfaction and improved
commercial efficiency. Beyond commercial interactions, Orange aims
toincrease the share of the digital channel in its day-to-day relationship
with its customers, and to reduce the number of calls to call-centers
in Europe by 55% by 2023. At the same time, Orange plans to rely on

Market, strategy and business model

Creating a future-facing company

Addressing the skills challenge, guiding everybody
towards a sustainable digital transformation and being
one of the most attractive employers

Thanks to its size and the diversity of its business lines, the Group is
able to give its employees the possibility of improving their skills to
keep up with and anticipate market developments, in line with its
“digital and caring” employer promise. Orange’s aim is that in 2025,
the face of the Group will be more international, more B2B oriented
and at the cutting-edge of new technologies.

To support this structuring development, Orange will put in place an
ambitious upskilling and professional retraining plan, and will invest
more than €1.5 billion in a skills reinforcement program open to all
employees. It aims to train 20,000 employees in network virtualization,
artificial intelligence, data, Cloud Computing, coding and cyber security.
For the successful conduct of this project, the Group will rely on
Orange Campus, which will become a network school open to all
employees and new external trainees and, at the same time, endeavor
to enhance the company’s appeal to attract new talents.

Lastly, Orange aims to create the right conditions for a sustainable and
responsible transformation to ensure the social and human cohesion
of projects undertaken by the Group in the world.

A growth ambition accompanied by an operational

on a combination of targeted initiatives relating to:

= the Group’s transformation plan launched in 2019, which aims to
improve agility and efficiency and achieve better internal cooperation;

= digitization which should reduce the cost of customer care, and
enable the automation of network management and maintenance
processes to absorb the expected surge in the number of
connections and data traffic;

= the development of shared services initiatives as is already the case
in the Group with IT services;

= optimization of certain expenses (“smart spend”) such as the
reduction of 5% per year up to 2023 of the cost of central functions,
other than personnel costs, or the control of energy costs which is
a major challenge for the future.

Market, strategy and business model

1.2.3 Business model

By deploying a robust network and developing innovative and responsible products and services, Orange plays an active role in society and
enables customers around the world to take advantage of digital technologies.

A business model focused

on creating and sharing value

Trust, a fundamental value at Orange

Orange champions a vision of a positive digital world through four key
values: trust, proximity, service quality and humanity. Trust is at the
heart of both Orange’s business model and the relationships that it
builds with its customers, stakeholders and partners. It forms the
foundation for its vision, offering an alternative to other major operators
in the world of technology, connectivity and, more generally, inclusive
digital relationships.

Orange’s business model

Orange’s infrastructure provides greater connectivity to its retail,
business and wholesale customers. Indeed, Orange is offering faster
speeds by rolling out fiber optic broadband, deploying 5G and
developing additional services in customers’ homes (content, at-home
services as well as remote surveillance and assistance). Its expertise
as both a network operator and digital services integrator all along the
digital value chain means it combines the full range of skills required
to support businesses with SDN technology, data and Al, cyber
security, mutlicloud and smart mobility services and more. It’s through
its smart and reliable networks that Orange develops financial services
for Orange Money and Orange Bank.

Each of Orange’s Engage 2025 ambitions — which include reinventing
its operator model, accelerating in growth areas, placing data and Al
at the heart of its innovation model and co-creating a future-facing
company — has been designed to maximize the value Orange creates.
Orange also strongly believes that financial performance goes hand
in hand with social and environmental responsibility, which is why its
goals of promoting digital equality and achieving net zero carbon
emissions by 2040 underpin its new strategic plan.

Understanding the impact of, and the role it plays in the technological,
economic, environmental and social factors that shape the world, has
led Orange to champion a vision of a digital world that is
people-focused, inclusive and responsible.

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

Sharing value for a digitally responsible world

The following pages illustrate the way in which Orange shares the
value it creates with its stakeholders.

The Group’s employees represent its most valuable asset, which is
why Orange promotes employability and skills development to
effectively implement its strategy. Its infrastructure enables Orange to
offer a customer experience that combines the best in human and
digital services. In 2019, Orange invested €672 million in research and
development to drive responsible innovation centered on inclusive
products and services, cyber security and eco-design.

Orange’s robust financial position ensures profitability and performance
for its lenders, investors and shareholders. External purchases
accounted for €19.3 billion in 2019, demonstrating that Orange’s
suppliers are the first to benefit from its cash flows. Orange fosters
responsible, ethical collaboration with its suppliers, to ultimately create
jobs and improve the quality of working conditions across its entire
value chain. The strong presence it has built up in regional communities
means Orange actively contributes to digital inclusion and wealth
creation both locally and nationally. Furthermore, Orange is taking
action to respond to the climate emergency by reducing its CO,
emissions and improving energy efficiency.

Engage 2025, a new Orange strategic plan
for 2025

In December 2019, Orange presented its new strategic plan Engage
2025. The new growth plan, which continues the work of the
Essentials2020 plan launched in 2015, looks to achieve exemplary
social and environmental conduct based on four ambitions:

Significant events

= reinventing its operator model, by capitalizing on its leading position
in networks thanks to increased connectivity (FTTH and 5G), and
consolidating its leadership in more open and _ higher-valued
infrastructures;

= accelerating Orange’s development in three areas of growth, i.e.
Africa and the Middle East, B2B services (focusing on cyber security)
and financial services;

= placing artificial intelligence (Al) at the heart of Orange’s innovation
model, to enter a new stage in the digital transformation process.
Al will be used to reinvent the customer experience, create smarter
networks and improve our operational effectiveness;

= and co-creating a future-facing company, addressing the skills
challenge in line with Orange’s “digital and caring” employer promise,
which includes a mass employee training program, network
virtualization, Al, data, Cloud Computing, code and cyber security.

For further information on the Engage 2025 strategic plan, see
Section 1.2.2 The Orange Group strategy.

Investment in networks

The rollout of networks providing broadband and very high-speed
broadband Internet access was one of the five levers of the
Essentials2020 strategic plan, and will remain a priority focus for
Engage 2025. In 2019, investments in networks (excluding
telecommunications licenses) represented over two-thirds of the
Group’s economic CAPEX.

Fixed access networks

The Group is continuing accelerated deployment ofits very high-speed
fixed broadband networks with 7.0 million new households
connectable year-on-year. On December 31, 2019, Orange had
39.5 million very high-speed broadband connectable households
throughout the world (up 21.5% year-on-year), including 16.3 million
in France, 14.9 million in Spain and 7.4 million in the rest of Europe
(operational areas).

In France, Orange signed in December 2019 a 700 million euros loan
agreement with the European Investment Bank to part-finance the
deployment of a very high-speed broadband network in the “AMII”
areas (less densely populated areas where private operators have
expressed an interest in deploying a very high-speed broadband
network). In 2019, Orange also continued with its accelerated fiber
optic deployment in other less densely populated areas by signing a
number of different agreements, to enable it to market its FTTH services
on Public Initiative Networks (PIN). They include:

= an agreement with Axione in 15 regions (départements), covering
2,234,000 homes and business premises spread over
4,000 municipalities, in which Axione is the agent responsible for
operating the very high-speed network;

= an agreement with Covage in the regions of Calvados, Essonne,
Haute-Savoie, Hérault, Seine-et-Marne, The Somme, the Lille urban
area and the Dunkirk urban community;

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

= anagreement with TDF in the Val d’Oise, Yvelines, de Indre-et-Loire,
Loir-et-Cher and Maine-et-Loire regions. The agreement covers
more than 1,000 municipalities outside of very densely populated
areas;

= and an agreement with Altitude Infrastructure, as part of a national
ramework agreement for 3.5 million FTTH connections in 22 regions.

Also see Note 15.1 to the consolidated annual financial statements.

In Spain, in April 2019, Orange and Vodafone announced the
enhancement of their fixed network sharing agreement. This agreement
will allow more rapid and efficient deployment of new generation
networks over a larger geographical area, offering significant
advantages to the respective business and residential customers of
both groups (also see Mobile networks below). Based on the same
network sharing and joint investment premise, in October 2019,
Orange signed an agreement with Masmovil, enabling it to strengthen
its position on the Spanish wholesale market (also see Mobile networks
below).

Mobile access networks

n 2019, Orange continued installing its 4G/4G+ networks. On
December 31, 2019, 4G coverage rates exceeded 95% of the
population in all European countries in which the Group operates
(including 99% in France, 97.2% in Spain and 99.9% in Poland). As
of December 31, 2019, the Group had 67.5 million customers with
4G packages throughout the world (up 20.1% year-on-year), including
15.9 million in France, 11.0 million in Spain, 16.8 million in Europe
(operational area) and 23.8 million in Africa and the Middle East. In
addition, the Group is continuing to actively prepare for the arrival of
5G technology, deploying it progressively over existing 4G sites. After
an initial commercial launch in Romania in November 2019, 5G will
start to be rolled out in 2020 in most of the European countries in
which the Group operates.

For the ninth year running, Orange confirmed its ranking as the number
one mobile network in France, according to the results of the annual
survey of mobile operator service quality in mainland France, published
by Arcep (Autorité de Régulation des Communications Electroniques
et des Postes) in October 2019. Overall, Orange was first or tied for
irst for Voice, SMS and Mobile Internet on 227 of the 238 criteria
measured. Orange is also continuing to roll out its mobile network
beside very densely populated areas. Therefore in December 2019.
Orange announced that it had entered into an agreement with ATC
France (subsidiary of American Tower Corporation and a leader in
elecom hosting, specializing in network infrastructure management
and marketing) for the deployment of 900-2,000 new sites over the
2020-2024 period, primarily located in rural areas and on major
ransport routes (see Note 15.1 to the consolidated annual financial
statements). In France, 5G spectrum blocks will be allocated in the
3.4-3.8 GHz band during the first half of 2020, covering a total of
310 MHz. Spectrums are allocated for a 15-year period, with the
option ofa 5-year extension under conditions which are not yet known.
Initially, each operator may purchase a 50 MHz block at a fixed price,
in return for certain commitments. Subsequently, a traditional multiple
round auction procedure will be implemented for each 10 MHz block,
for residual spectrums (for further information see Section 1.7.1.2.3.
Regulation of mobile telephony). In January 2020, Orange announced
that it had selected Nokia and Ericsson as equipment suppliers for its
5G rollout in mainland France.

In Spain, the network sharing agreement announced by Orange and
Vodafone in April 2019 (see Fixed networks above) also covered mobile
networks. This will allow overall improvement of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G
technology management for the two companies and will allow faster
and more efficient deployment of 5G technology. The active national
sharing of the mobile network will cover more than 14,800 mobile sites.
In total, this project will generate gross savings of approximately
€800 million over 10 years, but will involve an initial €300 million
investment over four years (including nearly €56 million in 2019).
Moreover, the sharing and joint investment agreement signed with
Masmovilin October 201 9 (see Fixed networks above) will also develop
and optimize costs for the 5G rollout. In addition, in December 2019,
Orange announced the sale of 1,500 non-strategic Spanish mobile
sites to Cellnex for €260 million (of which €185 million was paid in
2019). This deal forms part of an approach which involves retaining
control of the Group’s strategic assets.

n Belgium, Orange Belgium and Proximus signed a memorandum of
understanding to enter into a mobile access network sharing agreement
in July 2019 for 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies. This agreement aims
0 allow the two companies to meet growing customer demand in
‘erms of mobile network quality and domestic coverage. Subject to
approval of the agreement by the Regulatory Authority, the shared
mobile access network will be planned, built and operated by a new
equally-owned joint venture starting in the second quarter of 2020. In
inancial terms, Orange Belgium expects the agreement to deliver
cumulative savings in operating and investment costs of approximately
€800 million over 10 years and shall spend €130 million over the next
hree years to implement the agreement.

n Africa and the Middle East, 4G deployments continued in 2019,
particularly in Egypt, Morocco and Mali. With the addition of Burkina
Faso, Sierra Leone and Guinea in 2019, at the end of the year the 4G
network had been rolled out to 15 Africa and the Middle East countries
(excluding associates and joint ventures).

Transmission networks

In 2019, Orange strengthened its position on the submarine cables
market. The Group’s goal is to raise the quality of the services it offers
on its global network, while optimizing costs, so as to handle the
ever-increasing volume of data exchanges. A number of major
milestones over the year have consolidated this position:

= in January, Orange inaugurated the Kanawa cable with a length of
1,750 kilometers, connecting French Guiana, Martinique and
Guadeloupe;

in February, Orange and the members of the FLY-LION3 (Lower
Indian Ocean Network) consortium completed deployment of anew
submarine cable connecting Grande Comore Island and Mayotte.
Brought into service at the end of 2019, this cable enhances
connectivity in the Indian Ocean;

= in September, Orange, PCCW and PEACE (Pakistan and East Africa
Connecting Europe) officially sealed their agreement to deploy the
new PEACE Med submarine cable, initially covering a length of
12,000 kilometers. By 2021 the cable will connect Europe to Asia,
via East Africa. The agreement marks the arrival of the first Chinese
submarine cable on French soil;

In March 2019, moreover, Orange and Nokia announced the successful
complete migration of the Orange long-distance network in France,
Europe, and Asia, to a smart, distributed software system enabling
optimized management of network resources. This represents a major
step in the evolution of the Orange transmission network toward more
rapid and flexible production of transmission links, automation and
creation of new services with added value for its customers.

Finally, in November 2019, Orange announced the construction of a
new international backbone network to link eight countries in West
Africa. In addition to recent investments in the cutting edge MainOne
submarine cable linking Senegal and Céte d’lvoire to Europe, this

Overview of the Group and of its business —— 1

Significant events

infrastructure constitutes a new phase in Orange’s international
connectivity development strategy in Africa. The West African backbone
will be centrally operated, relying on a network of land-based fiber
optics and submarine cables. The network will be interconnected with
the rest of the world using various submarine capacities, as well as
linking the main West African capitals. The commercial launch of the
West African backbone is planned for the second half of 2020.

The multi-services and enhanced services strategy

Mobile financial services, content, connected objects and energy are
key pillars of the Group’s diversification, and fall within an enriched
services development strategy.

Mobile financial services
(Orange Bank - Orange Money)

In France, Orange Bank, which celebrated its second anniversary in
November 2019, reaffirmed its strategy to diversify its financial services
in 2019 by improving its new mobile service offer, including a Visa
Premium card, cashback offers for a proportion of selected purchases,
credit assigned to cover the costs of mobile handsets and other
Orange store purchases, and mobile payment through Google Pay. In
August, Orange Bank was rated the “best digital offer” for the second
year running by the D-Rating agency. As of December 31, 2019,
Orange Bank had over 500,000 customers won via Orange stores,
Groupama branches and digital channels, of which 390,000 were
account holders.

Orange Bank launched its international development plan in 2019.
Following its successful launch in France, Orange expanded its
presence by launching Orange Bank in Spain in November 2019.
Orange Bank's digital offer in Spain includes various services such as
bank accounts, Mastercard debit cards, savings accounts, mobile
payment through Apple Pay and a group expense management feature.
n Romania, Orange launched a debit card and an assigned credit offer
in 2019. The Group obtained a banking license in Africa from the
Central Bank of West African States, which should allow it to roll out
its credit and savings offer in 2020.

e
le

Finally, the Group has continued to expand Orange Money services in
he Africa and the Middle East. As of December 31, 2019, Orange
Money had a total of 45 million customers, 18 million of whom are
active customers who use the service every month, across 14 countries
(excluding associates and joint ventures, and excluding Niger following
its sale in November 2019).

NK

Content

Orange's content strategy will give priority to the broadest possible
distribution of the best content offerings on the market, and to invest
in movies and series via Orange Studio and OCS. This has resulted in
a series of agreements signed in 2019:

In France, in September 2019, OCS and Canal+ renewed their
multi-year distribution agreement to provide Groupe Canal+ subscribers
with access to OCS programs. OCS, which as of December 31, 2019
had 3.1 million subscribers, therefore now has access to the first pool
of French paid TV subscribers.

In other European countries, the Group pursued the rollout of content
services, notably related to TV, a key element of fixed/mobile
convergence offers. As such, Orange is marketing TV channel packages
in Spain in different themed areas, including movies, TV series and
soccer (La Liga and Champions League), for which the distribution
rights were renewed for the 2019-2020 season.

In Africa and the Middle East, in September 2019, Orange signed a
structured partnership with Canal+ Afrique to offer Canal+ TV packages
to all Orange households. This will be rolled out gradually in countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2020.

Significant events

Internet of Things (loT)

As announced in January 2019, thanks to the creation of Protectline,
a joint venture with Groupama, Orange has entered a new stage in its
multi-service operator strategy by becoming a fully-fledged player in
the remote property surveillance market.

In April 2019, Orange launched its remote property surveillance offer
Maison Protégée, for its fixed and mobile customers in France, enabling
it to meet expectations in terms of security. Orange also launched its
Maison Connectée solution for fixed and mobile customers in France.
Via a simple and unique application, this offer makes it possible to
manage connected objects in the home, providing Orange customers
comfort and peace of mind in their day-to-day lives.

In November 2019, Orange launched the Djingo voice assistant in
France, to make day-to-day activities easier for its customers. Djingo
includes a smart speaker and a voice-activated TV remote control.
The Djingo voice assistant provides smooth, intuitive and secure
access to Orange and partner services. The Djingo smart speaker,
which was developed with Deutsche Telekom, is voice-activated and
includes the Djingo virtual assistant. It also incorporates Amazon’s
Alexa voice assistant so that additional services available on Alexa can
be accessed. Orange is continuing to implement its multi-service
strategy to offer its customers a complete range of services for their
homes.

In June 2019, AT&T, KPN, Orange and Swisscom enabled data
roaming between their LTE-M loT networks, enabling low-power loT
equipment to benefit from service continuity on multiple networks in
North America and Europe. LTE-M technology will offer the possibility
of developing anumber of applications in the Internet of Things sector,
in order to reduce costs, offer more compact equipment, with greater
autonomy, and reach geographical regions that are difficult to access.

Orange Energy

As part of its multi-service strategy, Orange is now offering a range of
innovative Orange Energy services to facilitate energy access in the
African countries covered by the Group. In 2017, Orange began to
provide its customers in the Congo (DRC) with solar kits, which are
now available in eight African countries.

n November 2019, Orange joined forces with Greenlight Planet, the
largest supplier of prepaid energy services in Africa. The aim of the
partnership is to provide Orange customers with their own energy
solutions in a number of African countries, including Burkina Faso, the
Central African Republic, the Congo (DRC), Liberia, Mali and Sierra
Leone. As part of this partnership, Greenlight Planet will provide
bespoke equipment and support to enhance Orange’s range of energy
services. Orange Energy customers are able to use the service to buy
solar equipment, which they can use to power essential household
devices. Affordable and flexible subscription fees for the service can
be paid remotely by mobile phone and through Orange Money,
providing wider access to solar power due to the versatility of mobile
payments.

Digital transformation of business customers

Orange positions itself as a partner of companies in their digital
ransformation. Following its acquisitions of Basefarm, Business &
Decision and Enovacom in 2018, Orange shored up its business
offering with two major acquisitions in 2019:

n January 2019, Orange acquired 100% of SecureData, the United
Kingdom's top cyber security services provider, in the largest market
in Europe, for a total amount of €95 million net of cash acquired (see
Note 3.2 to the consolidated annual financial statements).

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

In July 2019, Orange agreed the 100% acquisition of SecureLink for
the total amount of €371 million net of cash acquired (see Note 3.2 to
the consolidated annual financial statements). This new acquisition
positions Orange as a major player in the European cyber securi
sector, with operations in eight European countries representing 75%
of the market.

In addition, in July 2019 Sony selected Orange Business Services to
strengthen and overhaul the communications infrastructure of the
Japanese manufacturer’s Film and Electronics entities within its global
network. Orange will use its versatile SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide
Area Network) solution to improve the agility, transparency and security
of Sony’s entire global business activities.

Orange, a people-oriented and digital employer

Creating a future-facing company, addressing the skills challenge
while supporting everyone as part of a responsible transformation and
being one of the most attractive employers are the priorities defined
by the Group during the presentation of its new strategic plan Engage
2025, and follow on from Orange’s “digital and caring” employer
promise.

In May 2019, Orange announced that it was signing an agreement
with four trade unions regarding the implementation of a Central
Committee of the Orange Works Council (Orange CCUES), which
covers 80,000 employees. Following the 2017 arrangements and
given the specific nature of its business, Orange has used this
agreement with social partners to define a new structure for its
Employee Representative Bodies (IRP), with a Central Labor and
Economic Committee (CSEC), 14 Labor and Economic Committees
specific to each Establishment (CSEE) and 86 Commissions for Health,
Safety and Working Conditions (CSSCT).

In July 2019, the Group signed a global agreement on gender equality
in the workplace with the UNI global union. This is the first agreement
of its kind for CAC 40 and telecom companies. The agreement is
scalable and can be adapted to all countries in which the Orange
Group operates, in order to cover all 147,000 employees worldwide.

Orange has opted to place skills at the heart of its new Engage 2025
plan, both to support major technological changes and their effects,
i.e. the need to continually adapt the workplace, and to support the
changing face of the Group between now and 2025, to become more
international, more B2B-oriented, younger while remaining
multi-generational, and at the cutting-edge of new technologies. With
this in mind, Orange plans to invest more than €1.5 billion in an
ambitious skills development and professional retraining program. The
aim of this commitment is to strengthen, adapt and renew all
employees’ skills, while also addressing a new external audience in
order to build the employment resources of the future. To address this
challenge, Orange has set itself three major priorities: (i) strengthening
its technological expertise, (ii) developing data practices and
applications, artificial intelligence (Al) and cyber security in all business
lines, and (iii) offering each employee the chance to develop their soft
skills, regardless of their business area or country. In order to meet
these priorities, the Group is structuring its training around three main
areas, including (i) the launch and development of Orange Campus
for all company employees based on four priority areas: data and Al,
cyber security, management and soft skills, (ii) the wide-scale
deployment by 2025 of a work-based training scheme (Formation En
Situation de Travail - FEST), and (iii) Orange’s 2020 launch of its own
Apprentice Training Center (Centre de Formation d’Apprentis — CFA)
to drive growth and share knowledge on digital professional roles.

Changes to the asset portfolio

In June 2019, Orange sold its remaining 2.49% equity interest in BT
Group for a net amount of £486 million, i.e. €543 million, at the
indicative ECB rate of July 2, 2019 (settlement day). The effects of the
BT Group shareholding on the net finance cost are presented in
Note 12.7 to the consolidated annual financial statements.

In November 2019, Orange sold all of its 95.5% equity interest in
Orange Niger to Zamani Com S.A.S, which is fully owned by Orange
Niger’s minority shareholders. There will be a transition period during
which the company’s services will continue to be marketed under the

1.4

Orange provides consumers, businesses and other telecommunications
operators with a wide range of services including fixed telephony and
mobile telecommunications, data transmission and other value-added
services, including mobile financial services. The Group is present as
an operator in 26 countries (including two in which it holds a minority
interest). In addition to its role as a supplier of connectivity, the Group
also provides enterprise services, primarily in digital working solutions,
security and improving business processes.

Operating activities

In accordance with segment information from the consolidated annual
financial statements, the Group’s business is presented in this Section
under the following business segments: France, Spain, Europe, Africa

1.4.1 France

Orange is France’s incumbent telecommunications operator (see
Section 1.1 Overview). The bulk of its business is carried by Orange SA,
which is also the parent company of the Orange group.

The France business segment includes all fixed and mobile
communication services to consumers and companies with less than
50 employees") in France? as well as services for carriers. Activities
developed for companies with more than 50 employees, as well as
content activities and those of Orange Bank are covered respectively
in Sections 1.4.5, 1.4.6.2 and 1.4.7 of this document.

In 2019, the France business segment generated 41.4% of the Group’s
consolidated revenue.

The market

At September 30, 2019, the revenue of French telecommunications
operators declined by 1.3% on a sliding 12-month basis (source:
Arcep, 3rd quarter 2019). While fixed narrowband telephony revenue
continued its downward trend as a result of the steady decline in the
number of lines, fixed broadband revenue continued its growth due
to the increasing number of accesses. Despite intense competition,
mobile services revenue rose driven by a sustained growth in access
numbers.

The French broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet
market is dominated by four main operators that account for over 99%
of broadband customers. With a 40.1% market share, down 0.1 points
compared with end-2018, Orange is the market leader on this market
ahead of Free, Altice-SFR and Bouygues Telecom (ranked as 2, 3 and
4, respectively, in number of customers). °)

The French mobile market is dominated by the same four operators
as the fixed market, which account for 89% of mobile customers

Group’s financial statements (see Note 3.2 to the consolidated annual
financial statements).

In February 2020, Orange announced a planned public repurchase
offer and squeeze-out for its Business & Decision SA subsidiary. As
of December 31, 2019, Orange held 93.6% of the capital of Business
& Decision SA through its subsidiary Orange Business Services SA.
The planned offer requires a notice of compliance from the French
Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des marchés financiers — AMF)

(excluding M2M). With a market share of 31.9% in 2019 compared
with 32.5% in 2018, Orange also remains the leader in this market
ahead of its competitors Altice-SFR, Free Mobile and Bouygues
Telecom (respectively ranked 2, 3 and 4 in number of mobile customers
excluding M2M) and all of the MVNOs. ®)

Orange’s business activities

Orange France’s core business involves the provision of fixed-line,
broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet and mobile
telephony services for the Retail and Pro-SME markets. Its strategy is
based on improving speeds on fixed networks (fiber) and mobile
networks (4G and in the future 5G), promoting the take-up of new
services and conquering new growth areas, while continuing to propel
its customer relations to a new level of excellence (see Section 1.2.2
The Orange Group strategy).

n the Retail mobile market, Orange has segmented its offers into four
main categories: 2-hour 100 MB or 2-hour 5 GB for customers looking
‘or basic communication and Internet connectivity; 10 GB which offers
a combination of enhanced Internet connectivity and increased
communication options; 50 GB adapted to meet the needs of heavier
nternet users; and 100 GB and 150 GB for customers wanting the
best smartphones and who have very intense connectivity needs both
in France and abroad.

Orange is present in all market segments, including the entry-level
market, with four types of mobile contract marketed under the Sosh
brand at affordable prices that are available only on the Internet, with
no commitment and no handset. At the end of December 2019, Sosh
had 3.9 million mobile customers.

Since 2015, Orange has only marketed 4G offers, including entry-level
packages.

Operating activities

Orange pursued its family-based strategy with the development of
multi-line contracts through its flagship Open offer. Open mobile offers
are available in the same ranges as traditional mobile offers and include
the same levels of service.

Segmenting offers on the Retail and Pro-SME markets allows Orange
to continue to grow its subscriber base while the decline in prepaid
offers continues.

At the same time, the MVNO customer base hosted on Orange’s
network has remained stable on a sliding 12-month basis.

n the Retail broadband Internet market, Orange has segmented its
offers into two main categories: Livebox designed for customers
looking for basic Internet and TV services, and Livebox Up which
meets the needs of customers who want the highest speeds and a
premium TV experience. In terms of equipment, in October 2019
Orange launched a new Livebox 5, designed to have a lower carbon
ootprint and vastly improved speeds to meet customers’ growing
needs, and to incorporate the fact that many households share
bandwidth.

Sosh has also been present on the broadband Internet market since
2018, with affordable offers, available exclusively online and withou
commitment.

Orange’s and Sosh’s broadband Internet access offers are marketed
with FTTH technology in eligible areas, or alternatively, with ADSL.
Orange is the leader in terms of FTTH access sold, with a portfolio o'
nearly 3.3 million subscribers at the end of 2019.

Since the telecommunications market was opened to competition,
Orange has been the operator responsible for part of the provision o'
universal services. These include a minimal set of basic services
available to all citizens who request them, including connection to a
ixed network open to the public, and the provision of quality telephone
service at an affordable rate. See Section 1.7.1.2.4 Regulation of
fixed-line telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband
Internet.

Furthermore, Orange offers services to carriers, an activity which
includes the interconnection of competing operators, as well as
unbundling and wholesale services (ADSL and fiber optic), regulated
by Arcep, and construction and marketing services for very high-speed
iber optic networks. Unbundling services saw another decrease in
heir price regulated by Arcep on January 1, 2019. In addition, since
2011, Orange has been providing to Free Mobile national roaming
services on its 2G and 3G networks. See Section 3.2.1 Recent events.

With the steady growth in full unbundling, as well as the wholesale of
contracts and naked ADSL access to third-party Internet service
providers, the decline in revenue generated by the traditional telephony
service business continues. When it unveiled its new strategic plan,
Orange announced that an initial experimental phase of copper
decommissioning is due to start, with implementation planned between
2023 and 2030.

Orange is also pursuing advertising activities via its websites, which
are available in multi-screen web, mobile and tablet format with more
than 28.2 million unique visitors per month. The most frequently visited
French website on a daily basis, Orange.fr ranks seventh behind
Google, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon, Wikipedia and Instagram, with
an average of 9.5 million unique visitors per day. On mobile screens,
Orange attracts 19.1 million mobile users as well as 3.8 million tablet
users each month (source: Médiamétrie and Médiamétrie//
NetRatings — Total Internet Audience — October 2019).

Against a backdrop of fierce competition, Orange has also continued
to innovate, notably with the launch of its services around the home
(Maison Connectée, home automation service, Maison Protégée
service and Djingo smart speaker) and the ongoing development of
mobile financial services (See Section 1.4.7 Orange Bank).

Distribution

Orange is pressing ahead with its digital development strategy with a
100% digital customer experience in Orange online stores (available
on Orange.fr) and Sosh (via Sosh.fr), with Sosh offers available only
on the digital channel. In 2019, the digital channel accounted for
24.8% of sales actions. Orange’s contract management app My
Orange continued to attract visitors, with 5.2 million unique visitors at
end-December 2019.

The dedicated customer centers, based on the type of services
marketed, accounted for 19.1% of sales actions.

The network of retail stores spread across France continues to roll out
the Smart Store concept launched in 2015. At end-2019, this network,
which consisted of 370 stores owned by Orange (including
17 Megastores and 274 Smart Stores), and 196 Générale de Téléphone
Stores (including 124 Smart Stores), accounted for 51.8% of sales
actions.

Lastly, the other channels, which include direct marketing, door-to-door
and the multi-operator network, accounted for 4.3% of sales actions.

The Network

Orange’s commercial leadership is partly based on its leadership in
fixed and mobile networks.

On the fixed network, in 2019 Orange ramped up its rollout of very
high-speed broadband on its own and third-party networks. In one
year, Orange ensured that 4.5 million households were connectable
to FTTH (compared with 2.7 million in 2018), a new record in France.
69% of fiber optic installations were deployed by Orange in 2019
(source: Arcep, 3rd quarter 2019). At end-2019, Orange had
16.3 million households connectable to FTTH.

Actions to improve the fixed network speed with a view to significantly
improving the Internet experience of households and professional
customers in rural areas continued, with fiber deployment in town
centers (subscriber connection node opticalization, fiber to
sub-distribution frames), and participation in FTTH Public Initiative
Networks (PIN) of local and regional authorities. Orange has enjoyed
considerable success regarding its expertise in PIN deployment. Three
new agreements were signed in 2019 relating to the operation of fiber
optic networks for local authorities (Réunion, Kourou and Auvergne
phase 3). Moreover, in December 2019, Orange announced its plan
to combine its industrial weight with that of one or more major financial
partners by creating the Orange Concessions subsidiary, which will
eventually pool 4 million connections of the public initiative networks
(PIN) assigned to Orange.

As regards the mobile network, 2019 saw the continued deployment
of 4G reaching a coverage rate of 99% of the French population (up
0.4 points compared with end-2018), which is still the best 4G coverage
rate in France"). At the end of 2019, Orange had deployed 20,938 4G
sites in France® (source: ANFr, January 1, 2020).

For the ninth consecutive year, the Orange mobile network was ranked
irst by Arcep in 2019 (source: Arcep, October 2019).

This deployment involves the continued extension of coverage in
ourist areas, stadiums, trains (LGV and TER), subways and on the
motorway network. In December 2019, Orange entered into an
agreement with American Tower Corporation, a leader in telecoms
hosting, specializing in network infrastructure management and
marketing, for the deployment of 900-2,000 new sites over the
2020-2024 period, primarily located in rural areas and on major
ransport routes.

Orange also announced that it planned to create a towerco in France,
responsible for managing the directly owned towers of its mobile
network. This project meets three key objectives: improving operational
efficiency and optimizing investments in the mobile network, increasing

the towers co-location rate while maintaining Orange’s competitive
advantage, and finally ensuring better understanding of and highlighting
the quality and value of these assets. Orange plans to retain control
of this subsidiary, and the project forms part of a wider move towards
creating a European Towerco.

1.4.2

The Group has been present in Spain since the liberalization of the
Telecom market in 1998. Initially present in the fixed-line telephony
market, it acquired the mobile telephony operator Amena in 2005, and
hen adopted the Orange brand in 2006. The acquisition of the Jazztel
ixed-line operator in 2015 enabled Orange to consolidate its position
in terms of convergence thanks to Jazztel’s fiber coverage. The Group
has also strengthened its presence in the low-cost market with the
acquisitions of MVNO Simyo in 2012 and Republica Movil in 2018,
hereby consolidating its multi-brand strategy designed to cover all
segments of the market.

Spain

IN 2019, the Group generated 12.4% of its consolidated revenue in Spain.

The market

Since the consolidation was launched in 2014, the telecoms market
has been dominated by four operators: the incumbent Telefonica,
operating under the Movistar brand which acquired D+ in 2014;
Orange; Vodafone, which bought ONO in 2014; and MasMovil lbercom,
initially an MVNO, which acquired Yoigo in 2016, then signed a
commercial agreement to access Orange’s fixed and mobile networks.

In addition to competing on the B2B and B2C segments through their
main brands, these four operators also compete via other brands in
the low-cost market: Orange with Jazztel, Amena, Simyo and
Republica Movil; Telefonica with Tuenti and O2; Vodafone with Lowi;
and MasMovil with Pepephone.

Together, the four convergent operators control more than 90% of the
market, with Telefonica ranked first, followed by Orange (whose market
share in 2019 reached 26.1% for broadband Internet and 25.1% for
mobile), then Vodafone"),

Spanish market growth slowed in 2019, and was marked by
increasingly aggressive sales tactics with a move towards low-cost
services driving growth in this market segment, and a proliferation of
new brands.

Orange’s activities in Spain

On the Retail market, Orange is pursuing in Spain a multi-brand and
multi-service strategy aiming to offer high-quality services at the best
price, including entry-level packages, in order to meet the needs of all
customer segments. In 2019, Orange adapted its offer to meet growing
demand for data and services, and developed a multi-service
approach, going beyond connectivity to set itself apart from its
competitors. As part of this strategy, in 2019 it:

= continued to offer high-quality high-definition TV content available
on different devices, and also enhanced its TV offer by renewing
broadcasting rights for soccer matches and other premium content,

with public authorities, based on new technical solutions which both
improve communications and guarantee their security.

Moreover, Orange offers (primarily interconnection) services to
competing operators as part of its wholesale activities. See the Network
Section below.

In keeping with its Group strategy, in 2019 Orange in Spain also
committed to promoting entrepreneurship and digital transformation
through initiatives like Lanzate-Sé Digital. Orange’s actions
include Gigas Solidarios, to ensure that as many people as possible
can reap the benefits of the new digital society, and the
#porunusolovedelatecnologia initiative, to raise awareness amongst
adults and children on responsible use of new technologies.

The Network

Orange continued to deploy its FTTH network, with 1.1 million new
connectable households in 2019. At end-2019, Orange was able to
offer very high-speed broadband connections to 15 million households
hrough its own fiber optic network and thanks to the network sharing
agreement signed with other operators.

n April 2019, Orange and Vodafone announced the enhancement of
heir RAN-sharing agreement. This agreement will allow more rapid
and efficient deployment of new generation networks over a larger
geographical area, offering significant advantages to Business and
Retail customers.

n October, Orange signed an agreement with Masmovil, renewing and
extending their wholesale links both for fiber optic and mobile networks.
This deal will enable Orange to improve the ROI of its networks, and
reinforce its position as number one wholesale alternative player on
he Spanish market. The national 5G roaming agreement together with
he RAN sharing agreement signed with Vodaphone will enable 5G to
be rolled out efficiently and profitably.

Operating activities

1.4.3

Outside France and Spain, the Group is present in six countries in
Europe, where it is implementing its convergence strategy through the
deployment of very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband, and the
launch of new offers. After launching its Love convergence offers in all
European countries in 2018, Orange is now developing its convergence
strategy in each country, based on the local context and the strengths
of each of its subsidiaries:

Europe")

= in Poland, where the Group is the incumbent operator, leader in
fixed and number two in mobile;

in Belgium and Luxembourg, where the Group launched its
convergence offers via partnerships;

and in other countries in Central Europe (Romania, Slovakia and
Moldova) where the Group, leader in mobile, is a convergent player
via the deployment of fiber optic, the use of 4G for the development
of fixed via LTE, and its partnerships.

1.4.3.1

The Group has been present in Poland since 2000, the year it acquired
an interest in the incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja Polska
(renamed Orange Polska). In 2006, Orange became the single brand
for mobile activities in accordance with the Group’s brand policy. In
2012, it also became the single brand for all fixed-line telephony
services offered by the Group in Poland. Orange owns 50.67% of the
shares of Orange Polska, which is listed on the Warsaw Stock
Exchange. In 2019, the Group generated 6.2% of its consolidated
revenue in Poland.

Poland

Poland has four main mobile telephony operators: Orange, T-Mobile
(owned by Deutsche Telekom), Polkomtel (operating under the Plus
brand, owned by the Cyfrowy Polsat Pay-TV by satellite group) and
P4 (operating under the Play brand, controlled by Tollerton Investments
Ltd and Novator Telecom Poland SARL). At the end of 2019, these
‘our mobile telephony operators accounted for 98% of the total number
of SIM cards in Poland, with Orange being the leading operator with
a market share of 28.1% at end-December 2019).

nthe broadband Internet market, Orange ranks second with a market
share of 28.3% in the third quarter of 2019). Its principal competitors
are cable TV operators (mainly UPC Polska, Vectra and Multimedia
Polska), as well as Netia, a traditional telecommunications operator.

The Polish telecoms market is fragmented and consolidation is slow.
The Cyfrowy Polsat Group acquired Netia in 2018. However, several
akeover bids for Multimedia Polska, Poland’s third largest cable
company, have failed.

Nevertheless, increasing numbers of operators are opting to adopt a
ixed and mobile convergent offer strategy on the B2C market, based
on infrastructure partners; primarily T-Mobile, (So far mobile-only)
started offering convergent o that use Orange Polska’s fiber
network. Other players include major cable operators such as UPC
and Vectra, which as MVNOs have started to offer mobile as well as
fixed services. Finally, Play has signed a cooperation agreement with
Vectra to offer its customers high-speed fixed broadband. While these
developments underscore the validity of Orange’s convergent strategy
in Poland, they are likely to boost competition.

return for additional benefits for subscribers. Orange Polska initiated
this price increase, which marked a major change of strategy in the
extremely competitive Polish market. Play and T-Mobile were not far
behind. These measures follow many years of strong competition,
which has driven down prices in Poland’s telecoms sector to amongst
the lowest in the EU.

Orange’s activities in Poland

In 2019, Orange Polska continued to implement its Orange.one
strategic plan. The plan is designed to generate long-term value and
sets forth the strategic vision of the company by 2020. Orange Polska
is aiming to become a benchmark Polish operator in the B2C and B2B
markets, while creating a business model that can deliver sustainable
revenues and profit growth. Orange plans to meet these objectives by
developing high-quality unrivaled products and services, boosted by
the development of its fiber optic network and digital capacity, and by
significantly improving its operational efficiency. In financial terms, the
strategic plan should provide ongoing improvements in revenues and
EBITDAaL trends, together with the sustainable growth of these
indicators.

Orange’s main strategic objective in Poland is to be the leader in
convergence, by marketing packaged offers of fixed and mobile
broadband access with financial incentives. Convergence enables
Orange to differentiate itself from its competitors and gain a larger
share of the household media and telecommunications budget and is
an effective retention tool. Orange pursued this strategy in 2019 by
focusing on its Love convergent offer. Love is a package which includes
both fixed and mobile services in its basic formula at an affordable
price, and can be extended for higher fixed broadband speed,
additional SIM cards, additional TV content and other value-added
services. At end-2019, the number of convergent customers totaled
1.37 million, representing 62% of the fixed broadband customer base.

Orange focuses on a differentiated approach in large cities and medium
and small towns, as well as rural areas, by taking into account the
local competitive environment, the potential in relation to population
density, and customer needs. In large cities, Orange focuses on
developing the FTTH coverage and improving its fixed broadband
market share, by leveraging its excellent positioning in the mobile
market via the cross-selling of fixed and mobile telephony services.
Mobile technologies in rural areas remain the first solution for broadband
access.

The number of fixed voice lines continued to decline in 2019, with a
net loss of voice customers (traditional PSTN or VoIP) due to structural
demographic factors, as well as the growing appeal of mobile telephony
services offering unlimited calls across all networks.

The Network

In 2019, Orange continued to roll out its FTTH network in Poland, and
extended it to 4.2 million connectable households.

Orange provides LTE (4G) services via 11,222 mobile mast sites. To
meet the strong growth in 4G traffic, Orange focused on spectrum
refarming in 2019 to increase the allocation made to 4G, by lowering
allocations to 2G and 3G technologies. Orange also focused on
increasing the number of sites allowing spectrum aggregation. At
end-2019, Orange’s 4G network covered 99.9% of the population @).

1.4.3.2

In Belgium and Luxembourg, Orange operates via Orange Belgium
(previously Mobistar) and its subsidiary Orange Communications
Luxembourg. Orange Belgium is listed on the Brussels Stock
Exchange. The Orange group holds 52.9% of the capital. Historically
present in the mobile segment in Belgium, in 2016 Orange launched
convergent offers across the entire country, based on the regulation
of wholesale access to cable, and then adopted the Orange brand
the same year. In 2019, Orange Belgium generated 3.1% of the
Group’s consolidated revenue.

Belgium & Luxembourg

Belgium

The competitive structure of the fixed-line telephony market remained
relatively stable in 2019, with the predominance of the incumbent
operator Proximus and the regional cable operators Telenet and VOO.
n September, Telenet announced that it was setting up a high-speed
1GB broadband network to cover Brussels and the whole of the
Flanders region.

Orange has two main competitors on the mobile telephony market:
Proximus (the incumbent operator, 53.5% owned by the Belgian State)
and Telenet (57.9% owned by the Liberty Global Group), which acquired
Base in 2016. With a market share by volume of 28.1% in the third
quarter of 2019, Orange is ranked second after Proximus").

n 2019, Orange continued to set itself apart from the competition as
a “bold challenger” by offering added value to its customers, and
particularly by introducing new features at no extra cost:

= Orange is the first operator to include MMS in its prepaid services
for Retail customers;

= Eagle customers also receive an unlimited package (data, calls and
SMS) within the EU;

= the data included in the Cheetah package has increased from 8 GB
to 15 GB.

On the convergence market, Orange launched the Love Duo package,
which combines a mobile subscription with an unlimited very
high-speed broadband plan.

On the B2B market, Orange acquired Upsize NV and its subsidiaries
BKM NV and CC@PS. Following this acquisition, Orange Belgium is
now able to extend its offer with Unified Communications &
Collaboration and BKM ICT services, in order to meet increasing
demand from B2B customers for a single supplier for connectivity and
CT-related services.

For its mobile network, Orange signed a mobile access network
sharing agreement with incumbent operator Proximus. This agreement
will improve the mobile experience thanks to wider coverage, improved
indoor coverage and a faster 5G rollout. In addition it will generate
significant environmental benefits and will also save on operating
costs. A new joint venture owned in equal shares by Orange Belgium
and Proximus will be set up to design, develop and operate the shared
mobile access network.

At end-2019, Orange Belgium became the first operator in Belgium
to open a dedicated business 5G test center. By creating this innovation
hub, and therefore working with industrial partners in such real-life
settings, Orange Belgium has begun to use the full potential of 5G
technology.

Luxembourg

Orange started its operations in Luxembourg in 2007 via the acquisition
of Voxmobile. The company adopted the Orange brand in 2009.

unlimited data, calls and text messages, marking the first stage of
Orange’s quest to establish itself as a “bold challenger” on the
Luxembourg market.

n 2019, Orange continued to reap the benefits of its convergent offers
with Love Essential, a mobile subscription combined with very
high-speed unlimited fiber optic broadband.

service providers, and Internet or digital players. Given the large
number of players, there is no reliable, relevant information available
on market shares.

Specifically with regard to the cyber security services market, Orange
is now a major operator, with a presence in 8 European countries, and
was ranked as the leading operator in France and fifth in the Europe,
Middle East, Africa region in 2018 (source: Teknowlogy Group

Orange Business Services activities

Orange offers a wide range of products and services, including those
that are packaged or tailor-made and using different methods such
as integrated, managed or Cloud, aimed at guiding businesses in their
digital transformation, and structured around their main challenges
(connectivity, mobility, streamlining of processes, fluidity of exchanges
with customers and support for their projects).

Orange has structured its portfolio of offers around four main types of
products and services:

= fixed telephony (traditional and IP) and audio conference services;
= enterprise mobile telephony offers;

= network offers, including certain service guarantee levels (mobile
and fixed-line connectivity, data transfer, hybrid networks, fixed-line
and mobile convergence offers);

= IT service offers and integration solutions, including:

— Cloud solutions (virtualization, development of “aaS’” (as a Service)
solutions and business models), which is the direction that many
business customers are taking. Orange is particularly well placed
in terms of the multi-cloud solutions that its customers are
increasingly demanding and for which it can share its experience
inthe construction, management and orchestration of large-scale
complex structures,

— Digital & Data solutions, strengthened by the recent acquisition
of Business & Decision. These make it possible, in addition to
system integration and supply, business applications and API
(Application Programming Interfaces), to design digital customer
solutions in the fields of Big Data, Data Analytics and Artificial
Intelligence,

— cyber-defense solutions covering infrastructures and users, in
managed and integrated or Cloud (safe work environments and
infrastructure, cyber-defense, management and governance),
supervised from a security operations center (see Section 4.1.1.2
Business opportunity: Orange Cyberdefense),

— intelligent mobility solutions based not only on mobile
technologies, but also on the loT (Internet of Things),

— unified communication and collaboration services (interoperability
between telephony, messaging and video conference solutions,
in triple play or quadruple play),

Operating activities

— consulting and customer services (analysis of needs, solutions
architecture, deployment and installation support, user training,
administration of services and solutions) in various areas:
switching to “all-IP,” adopting Machine to Machine and the Internet
of Things, supervising and managing quality of service, switching
to Cloud infrastructure solutions, and the digital transformation
of businesses.

These offers are also used to develop cross-sector business solutions
(finance, transport, energy, government and public sector, geolocation
and fleet management, etc.).

As regards its core business as an operator, Orange relies on
international partners to supplement its offer and geographical
coverage in areas where its customers operate and where its presence
does not offer a comprehensive solution. The Group is working to build
this type of partnership in the most developed markets, preferably with
the leading operator or its direct competitor, like NTT Communications
in Japan or AT&T in the United States.

1.4.6

The operating activities of the International Carriers & Shared Services
segment include:

= international carrier activities undertaken by the Wholesale
International Networks Division (roll-out of the international and
long-haul network, sales of international telephony and services to
international carriers, and installation and maintenance of submarine
cables);

= and the activities of OCS and Orange Studio in content.

he segment also includes other cross-cutting activities of the Group,
n particular research and innovation (See Section 1.6), or real-estate,
as well as support and shared activities including corporate functions
at the headquarters.

The operating activities of the segment accounted for 2.3% of the
Group’s consolidated revenue in 2019.

1.4.6.1

International Carriers’ activities

he market for wholesale operators is made up of three categories o'
player: global wholesalers, multinational retail operators (including
Orange) and regional players or specialists.

The wholesale market’s customer base comprises voice marke’
specialists (call-shop, prepaid cards), fixed and mobile domestic retai
carriers (including MVNOs), Internet access and content providers and
OTT players. International carriers also sell wholesale traffic to each
other.

Wholesale International Networks (WIN) offers a broad range o
solutions on the international market. Its business is structured on a
large infrastructure of long-haul networks. Its presence in both the
retail and wholesale markets means it can develop solutions that are
particularly well adapted to the needs of the retail operators.

The Group is notable for being heavily involved in the design,
construction and operation of submarine cables. With its ownership
or co-ownership of several cable systems, Orange ranks among the
world’s largest owners of submarine links. This has enabled it to satisfy
the increase in transatlantic traffic.

The Group’s wholesale activity is based on:

Orange also works in close collaboration with an ecosystem of
international technological partners, who are leaders in their respective
fields of connectivity, unified communication, Cloud infrastructure,
effective data use or cyber security.

Lastly, Orange is developing partnerships with service operators to
develop a common business approach to offer innovative solutions
for its customers.

In 2019, Orange signed a series of major contracts to support its
customers around the world, in particular with Sony to consolidate
and transform the communication infrastructures of its two largest
operating companies and create a future-proofed and standardized
network that will offer an enhanced experience to users worldwide,
with Mobileye®, an Intel subsidiary, to interconnect its latest generation
collision avoidance device, and with Mars Incorporated to roll out an

Orange Marine

Orange Marine is a major player in submarine cables, from the early
research and engineering stage through to the setting up of
intercontinental connections and the maintenance of existing cables.
In total, Orange Marine has installed more than 260,000 kilometers of
submarine cables (including over 30,000 kilometers of buried cables)
across all oceans and carried out surveys on over 80,000 kilometers
of seabed. Its vessels carried out more than 800 repairs on defective
cables, some of which were performed at a depth of 5,000 meters.
Orange Marine has a cable-laying fleet of seven vessels (six cable
ships and one submarine research ship). It represents 15% of the
global fleet and is one of the most experienced worldwide.

Orange Marine was particularly busy in 2019, with several large-scale
projects and, in particular, laid a new fiber optic submarine cable
linking Grande Comore Island and Mayotte. Brought into service in
the third quarter of 2019, this cable enhances connectivity in the Indian
Ocean.

1.4.6.2

Content distribution activities (TV, video-on-demand, music, video
games) are a key component of Orange’s strategy as a multi-service
operator with nearly 10 million households connected to its TV universe
at the end of 2019. These activities help promote the Group’s very
high-speed broadband offers.

Content activities

Orange’s content strategy is primarily based on developing partnerships
with rights holders and service publishers. Orange is focused on its
role of aggregator and distributor by referencing the best entertainment
services available in order to offer them to its customers through its
broadband networks.

In France, Orange is also developing an ambitious policy of producing
and co-producing films and series, and broadcasting them via its
Orange Studio subsidiary and its premium service, OCS. All OCS
programs are available via scheduled programming and on-demand.
Most distributors offer OCS and it can be accessed directly online. At
end-2019, OCS had 3.1 million subscribers.

After the broadcast of Nom de la Rose, in 2019, Orange Studio
co-produced two new original content series, Devils and Cheyenne &
Lola, which are due to be broadcast on OCS in 2020. In 2019, Orange
Studio also co-produced a dozen or so films, including Une Vie cachée
by Terrence Malick (Cannes official selection) and La Belle Epoque by
Nicolas Bedos which generated over 1.2 million cinema admissions.
At the same time, Orange Studio continued to enrich its catalog and
expanded its international sales activity via an agreement with UGC
and own-brand distribution mandates.

1.4.7 Orange Bank
Mobile financial services are a key component of the Orange Engage
2025 strategy. With the expansion of its multiservice activities on the
African continent, B2B and IT services, mobile financial services are
one of the Group’s three growth drivers.

The banking market

The banking sector is currently undergoing far-reaching change,
marked by:

= adaptation to regulatory changes (DSP2, GDPR, etc.) in the light of
more vigilant regulatory authorities (ACPR, CNIL, etc.);

= increased competition and fragmentation of supply (online trading,
account aggregators, open banking, etc.);

Overview of the Group and of its business —— 1

Operating activities

a

OCS experienced a steady increase in subscribers in 2019 due to i
exclusive broadcasting rights to the latest season of Game of Thrones
and anumber of other new series and seasons, and its exclusive rights
to broadcast film premiers.

In other European countries, the Group is pursuing the roll-out of
content services, notably related to TV, a key element of fixed/mobile
convergence offers. As such, Orange is marketing TV channel
packages in Spain based on soccer offers (La Liga and Champions
League), for which the distribution rights were renewed for the
2019-2020 season. Orange in Spain also expanded its range with
SVoD services such as Amazon Prime Vidéo, FlixOlé and StarzPLay,
while continuing to develop its Orange Series 4k channel. The Group’s
other European subsidiaries are also developing this TV strategy.

In Africa, in September 2019, Orange signed a structured partnership
with Canal+ Afrique to offer Canal+ TV packages to all Orange
households. This will be rolled out gradually in countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa in 2020. Orange is also continuing to invest in
production, particularly in Senegal with Season 7 of the Idoles series
or in Céte d'Ivoire with the Assinie series. In terms of mobile services,
Sonatel launched its Wido video streaming app which gives unlimited
access to a catalog of films and series produced or acquired with
exclusive rights. Orange also signed distribution partnerships with
several content publishers, particularly in Egypt with BelN Sports.

The music market continued to grow in 2019 via streaming. Deezer,
in partnership with Orange since 2010, now exclusively offers Rotana’s
catalog in Arabic. The Deezer service is available with Orange in
France, Romania, Luxembourg and Céte d'Ivoire. Orange is also
continuing to roll out its radio and podcast service, Orange Radio,
which is now available in 17 countries via mobile apps, web TV and
connected devices.

In the video games sector, the Orange TV games streaming offer
continued to grow in 2019. In the mobile segment, the rise of unlimited
subscriptions and Freemium games continued with the Orange Juegos
offer in Spain and a sustained growth in the African countries where
Orange manages more than a million mobile gaming customers. In
2019, Orange also organized the second Orange eSports Experience,
which is now the benchmark pan-African video gaming competition.

Lastly, Orange introduced innovations in the field of digital reading in
Africa by opening, in association with the French partner “Youscribe,”
a digital book and press service which is again a mark of its social
commitment on this continent. Available in 3 African countries (Senegal,
Céte d’lvoire and Cameroon), it supplements the existing service in
Tunisia.

= the integration of new technologies (Instant payment, Data and Al,
Blockchain, etc.) for greater innovation and performance;

= safeguarding profitability in an unfavorable economic climate:
reduced interest margins, pressure on commissions, capital
requirements;

= a digital explosion which is redefining customer behaviors
(autonomous, remote, volatile, demanding) in relation to their bank.

Fierce competition on the banking market breaks down into six
categories of operator:

= the major traditional banking networks (which are gradually adapting
their offers to the new situation);

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

‘| — Overview of the Group and of its business

Orange’s networks

= online banks (some of which are subsidiaries of the traditional major
banking networks), which developed mainly during the 2000s
(Boursorama Banque, ING Direct etc.); they now position themselves
as offering free basic banking services and adopt an aggressive
acquisition policy (e.g.: welcome bonuses) while joining the race for
innovation;

= neo-banks, set up in the 2010’s, which are based on a mobile

application and simplified customer experience. Some have banking
icenses, others do not (N26, Revolut, Compte Nickel, etc.). They
compete with online banks by capturing market share through
innovation (e.g.: freemium and payment services);

= Fintechs (financing platforms, means of payment and account
aggregators);

= the tech giants who offer mobile payment solutions: Apple Pay, the
Facebook Messenger payment function, Samsung Pay, Android
Pay, etc. They can now offer financial services directly via banking
icenses;

= large retailers (Leclerc, Fnac Darty, etc.), which aim to take a share
of the mobile financial services value chain;

= new operators which continue to come onto the banking market
(MafrenchBank, Uber Money, Free, Starling Bank) from all directions.

Online banks and neo-banks have taken market share from traditional
banks. In early 2019, neo-banks captured around 15% of new account
openings (Source: AT Kearney analysis, Feb-19 — CB insight, 2019
Fintech trends to watch).

Orange Bank activities

Orange Bank is positioned at the frontier of the banking and telecom
sectors.

Modeled originally on the mobile uses of customers, in France, the
offer carries no conditions related to income, savings or minimum
balance. There are no bank charges attached to accounts and their
associated bank cards (Subject to certain terms and conditions of
use). All basic banking services are offered: bank account, bank card,
checkbook, authorized overdraft, savings account, ala carte insurance
and personal loan. Customers can perform all their banking operations
ona mobile handset. When opening a bank account, customers have
access to a network of more than 280 Orange-approved stores.

Strongly relying on telecoms functions, Orange Bank’s innovations
offer customers the option of making contactless payments with credit

1.5

For Orange Group, the networks are a strategic asset and, as such,
are subject to constant supervision, maintenance and modernization.
Orange’s new strategic plan, Engage 2025, launched in
December 2019, is based on four key ambitions, including reinventing
its operator model by capitalizing on its network advances (see
Section 1.2.2 The Orange Group strategy).

Orange’s networks

At end-2019, Orange operated networks in 26 countries to serve its
customers in the consumer market and in nearly 200 countries or
territories to serve its Business customers. Orange is continuing to
modernize its networks to provide its customers with ever greater and
more enhanced connectivity in all its locations.

cards or via mobile handsets, gaining immediate access to their bank
account balance, temporarily blocking and unblocking their credit
card from the application, and sending money by text message.
Customer relations are based on the virtual advisor, Djingo, the bank’s
first point of contact, available 24/7. Since the launch, more than two
million conversations have taken place between customers and Djingo,
50% of which were entirely managed by the virtual advisor. There is
also a customer relations center whose staff are split between Amiens
and Montreuil.

2019 was, in particular, marked by the launch of a Premium bank card
in March and by ongoing improvements to the app. This was reflected
by an increased Apple Store ranking which rose from 3.4/5 in January
to 4.5/5 in December. The bank was also ranked as “best digital offer”
for the second year running by the D-Rating agency (assessed on the
basis of 420 criteria).

Orange Bank also accelerated its cross-sales strategy with its
shareholders, Orange and Groupama. Since July, the bank has been
offering customers with Visa Premium cards 5% cash back in Orange
stores, valid on all equipment, mobile phone and accessory purchases.
In addition, since October 2019, financing has been offered to eligible
customers in Orange stores to enable them to finance their purchases
(smartphones, telephones, tablets, connected objects and
accessories). Car loans are also sold within the Groupama network
alongside motor insurance. Lastly, the bank has joined forces with a
new partner, Nexity, to finance real estate projects.

In France, as of December 31, 2019, Orange Bank had over
500,000 customers won via Orange stores, Groupama branches and
digital channels.

On the international stage, Orange Bank was launched in Spain in
November 2019. This bank which is 100% mobile, offers Orange
customers a selection of savings accounts, checking accounts,
Mastercard credit cards, group management as well as numerous
discounts on Orange phone bills. Its launch was accompanied by the
payment of 1% interest on deposits of up to €20,000, one of the
highest savings rates in Spain. Innovations include the Group
management function which enables funds and expenses to be shared
or transferred between several people, giving customers the option to
manage joint subscriptions such as water bills or Netflix accounts.

In July 2019, the Group also obtained a banking license from the
Central Bank of West African States to create Orange Bank Africa").

The Group's investments in its networks, other than those to maintain
their quality (pole, cable and mast replacement) are designed to
improve these networks in a number of respects:

= the development of very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband
(FTTH and 4G/5G), increased data transfer volumes and reduced
connection latency. These investments concern all of the networks,
from the mobile radio network and household Internet connectivity
to submarine cables;

= user migration from old technologies (analog telephony, copper
networks, 2G, 3G) to new technologies;
= the gradual virtualization of network control functions (“programmability”
of networks so that they can be adapted more quickly to new
services and uses);

= automation of network operation which improves the quality of
service for customers.

The network architecture is broken down into (i) access networks
(fixed or mobile), (ii) transmission and IP transport networks and (iii)
service control networks.

Access networks connect each customer, whether an individual or a
business customer, and provide a first level of customer data

1.5.1 Access networks

Fixed access networks

Analog access and ADSL/vDSL broadband access

Copper access is made up of a pair of copper wires that connect each
customer to a concentration point and give the latter access, via the
distribution and transport network, to alocal switch. It is used to deliver
analog voice services and broadband access services.

Orange operates copper access networks in France and Poland, and
in various countries in Africa and the Middle East (Céte d'Ivoire, Jordan,
Senegal), to provide analog voice access services and data to the
Retail, Enterprise and wholesale markets.

Fixed broadband ADSL/vDSL access (for voice applications, Internet
access and television) is available in:

= France and in Poland, with coverage approaching 100% on the
incumbent local loop;

= Africa and the Middle East countries where Orange is the operator
of the copper local loop;

= other countries (including Egypt, Spain and Slovakia), where Orange
uses the local loop of the incumbent operators, either unbundled
or via bitstream-type offers;

= Belgium and Romania, where broadband offers are marketed using
the network of third-party operators;

= Moldova where, following the acquisition of Sun Communications,
Orange operates a cable network.

Networks and services based on copper access are used less and
less as users move to very high-speed broadband. This means that
they are constantly being optimized and, in France, an_ initial
experimental phase of copper decommissioning is due to start, with
implementation planned between 2023 and 2030.

Very high-speed broadband fiber optic access

FTTH (Fiber To The Home) network access can extend the available
broadband ADSL/VDSL service offer to include upstream and
downstream very high-speed broadband (of 100 Mbits/s and more),
with improved performance, in particular in terms of response time.

In France, Orange has been deploying FTTH access for over ten years
using GPON technology, which can pool several very high-speed
broadband accesses on a single fiber without impairing the capacity
of each access point’s capacity to increase speed. The deployment
of the FTTH network started in 2007 in a few major French cities and
was then expanded to all large cities. During the years 2011 and 2012,
Orange entered into sharing arrangements with other telecoms
operators to speed fiber optic rollout. At end-2019, Orange was the
leading fiber optic network in France with 16.3 million households
eligible for Orange Fiber (see Section 1.3 Significant events).

Overview of the Group and of its business —— 1

Orange’s networks

aggregation. Transmission and IP transport networks connect the
access networks between them and with the service and data servers,
which may be located in other parts of the world. Service control
networks, which drive access, transmission and IP transport networks,
provide the connection between people and manage the services
(voice, TV, Internet access, data).

A glossary defining several of the technical terms used in this Section
may be found in Section 7.2.2 at the end of this Registration Document.

n Spain, Orange is also deploying fiber and its FTTH network reached
14.9 million connectable households at end-2019. An FTTH network
was also deployed in Poland, with connectivity offered to some
4.2 million households, as well as in Slovakia with 500,000 connectable
households. The deployment of FTTH networks has also started in
Jordan, Cdte d'Ivoire, Morocco and Senegal.

Radio and satellite access

n various African countries and in Eastern Europe, fixed services are
provided through 4G/LTE in addition to copper and fiber optic networks.

n addition to copper, fiber and radio access, fixed residential access
and satellite television services are also marketed via space capacity
rental.

Mobile access networks

The GSM (2G), UMTS (8G) and LTE (4G) access networks support
voice and data communication services that reach several tens of
Mbits/s, at an average bit rate, and up to several hundreds when
conditions are optimal, which makes it easier to send and receive
voluminous content (audio, photo and video). The Group operates a
mobile network (2G/3G/4G) in each of the countries where it offers
retail consumer telecommunications services.

To reduce its environmental impact and operating costs, Orange
shares more than half of its radio sites with a competitor. Sharing can
be either “passive” (limited to the masts only), or “active” (masts and
active equipment). Sharing, which in the past has involved 2G/3G/4G
technologies, is now moving on to 5G. In 2019, new site-sharing
projects were announced or started, in particular, in Spain in towns
with less than 175,000 inhabitants and in Belgium across the whole
territory. In addition, in France, under the New Deal agreement between
the Government, Arcep and the four mobile operators, to ensure
better mobile coverage in rural areas, the latter signed a mobile
site-sharing agreement in July 2019 to roll out 4G across sites
nominated to be pooled under an active sharing policy (see
Section 1.7.1 Regulation of telecommunication activities).

2019 was marked by:

= continued growth of uses and traffic, across the Group’s networks.
To anticipate this growth, which will continue over the coming years,
the Group invested in its networks to increase their capabilities and
performance;

= preparation for 5G, in particular, with the preparation of fiber optic
radio site connectivity, anticipating the requirements associated
with 5G very high-speed broadband and its initial deployment,
especially for the Orange Romania network, which launched its
commercial 5G service in November 2019 in three cities;

= continued rollout of 4G/4G+ networks in European countries to
increase the coverage of the population and speeds;

1.5.2

National networks

In each country where there are retail customers, Orange has a national
IP transport network relying on a transmission network. This
infrastructure is primarily made up of fiber optics, but also radio links,
especially for alternative or purely mobile networks in MEA countries.
These networks support voice and data traffic, for fixed, mobile,
enterprise and wholesale services.

n France, a dedicated Enterprise IP network is also in service. The
main purpose of this network is to connect a company’s French sites
or internal data exchange on a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and
provide it with Internet connectivity. It also provides Voice over IP
ransport for companies.

Optical links offer a bandwidth of up to 200 Gbits/s per wavelength,
and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing technology (DWDM)
makes it possible to have 80 wavelengths per fiber. Orange is one of
he world leaders in the use of advanced optical functions in order to
have a more flexible transmission network. For example, in a first of
its kind worldwide, Orange deployed a 400 Gbits/s per wavelength
optical link between Paris and Lyon in 2013.

Furthermore, Orange offers direct connections by fiber optic to
business customers, providing them with very high-speed broadband
services.

nthe MEA region, Orange is the leading telecommunications operator
in terms of kilometers of terrestrial transmission networks deployed
(national and multi-country) with over 20,000 km.

International network
The international network relies on three networks:

= the European WELDON (WidE Long distance Domestic Optical
Network) network, a long-distance network in France, whose
deployment started in April 2012, and which was extended to serve
Frankfurt, London, Barcelona, Madrid, and submarine cable stations.
It is expected to be extended to other areas neighboring France as
needed in the future;

1.5.3 Service control networks

National networks

Control network

n all countries where it has access and transmission/IP transport
networks, Orange operates a control network (also called signaling
network). This network manages calls or data connection, updates of
location data for mobiles, roaming and SMS. These networks are
upgrading to new standards, for example to manage 4G roaming.

Fixed-line voice network

n the countries in which it has fixed-line operations, Orange operates
a switched telephone network (STN) to deliver analog voice and ISDN
digital services. These networks are continually being optimized
because of declining usage. In France, Orange stopped marketing its
analog voice services at the end of 2018, and announced the first

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

= continued 4G deployments in the Africa and Middle East (MEA) region
with a 4G service covering 15 countries in the region at end-2019;

= for the Internet of Things (loT), continued deployment of LTE-M
technology on the 4G network in European countries.

Transmission and IP transport networks

= the North-American backbone served by the two arms of the TAT-
14 transatlantic cable system;

= and the Asian backbone in Singapore served by the SEA-ME-WE3
and SEA-ME-WE4 submarine cables.

In 2019, Orange also announced the construction of a new international
backbone network in West Africa. This infrastructure relies on a
terrestrial fiber optic network and submarine cables to link eight West
African countries.

Satellites

Orange uses satellite communications to provide VSAT services (Very
Small Aperture Terminal) to Orange Business Services’ terrestrial or
maritime customers and to ensure connection with isolated mobile
sites in Africa and IP or voice connectivity to other operators. To
provide those services, Orange uses rented space capacity from
satellite operators (such as Eutelsat, Intelsat, SES and Arabsat).

Submarine cables

To address the strong growth in international telecommunications
traffic and in a highly competitive market, Orange is maintaining its
level of investment in submarine cables and is continuing to develop
its network in order to meet the needs of its customers. Due to the
high cost of investments required in the construction of cables, such
investments are carried out with the different players involved
(operators, private companies, GAFAM) and in various forms
(consortiums, purchase of user rights, transmission-capacity rental,
etc.)

Orange is part of some 50 consortiums covering various routes: North
Atlantic, Caribbean, Europe-Asia, Europe-Africa. In 2019, the PEACE
project was confirmed with the signing of an agreement to lay a new
cable linking France with East Africa and Pakistan and to bring it into
service in 2021.

zones where voice services will only be available using IP technology
from the end of 2023.

Orange also rolled out fixed-line VoIP networks using IMS technology
(IP Multimedia Subsystem) in many countries for retail and business
uses.

Mobile voice network

Until 2015, all mobile voice traffic was managed in switch mode by
the mobile network in each country. In 2015, Orange rolled out mobile
IMS infrastructure in Europe to offer VoLTE services (VoIP over LTE)
and VoWifi (mobile Voice over WiFi). The first commercial application
of this technology was in Romania, with the launch of VoLTE in
September 2015. At end-2019, VoLTE and VoWifi were rolled out in
all the Group’s European networks and used by millions of customers.
International networks

Voice network

Orange has international switching nodes (CTI 4G) to manage voice
traffic to and from France in the fixed-line and mobile markets for retail
customers, businesses and operators, and to centralize the transfer
of international traffic for its subsidiaries. These switches, initially in
circuit technology (TDM), have developed into hybrid NGN nodes to
carry Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic.

Orange also operates a network for the supply of voice services for
international businesses which is based on the international IP MPLS
network.

1.6

In the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, which
is undergoing major change in its value chain with the increase in the
number of players and the creation of new economic models,
innovation is a major growth engine for the Orange Group. In 2019,
the Group continued its research and innovation activities devoting

1.6.1

Orange is currently a leading private player involved in digital research
in France. In a rapidly evolving world, where changes are happening
very fast, Orange wants to be a focused operator, involved in current
and future transformations: connectivity, 5G, large-scale Internet of
Things, Artificial Intelligence etc. The Group is developing an open
research approach that sets Orange apart from its competitors and
an inclusive innovation that is at once accessible to all and focused
on a positive view of progress.

Research and innovation

Orange is convinced that using data and artificial intelligence (Al) in a
responsible, useful and accessible way will open new prospects for
individuals, society and the planet. Having been committed to
developing Al and data analysis-related technologies and skills for a
number of years, Orange is investing in the French and European
research and innovation ecosystem, is joining forces with a number
of start-ups and industrial partners, andis participating in the European
Al agenda. Orange has also set up an Al and Data skills development
scheme and has combined with Microsoft and Simplon to create the
“Microsoft Al School”, the first Orange intake for which came out in
2019. For Orange, Data and Al will be developed around three key
areas: making its networks more intelligent, improving its operational
efficiency and reinventing the customer experience. In November 2019,
Orange launched the Djingo voice assistant, developed with Deutsche
Telekom. As the main interface for accessing Orange services, this
smart speaker also incorporates Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant so
that additional services available on Alexa can be accessed.

Supplying its customers with the best possible fixed and mobile
connectivity is key to Orange’s strategy. On the mobile market, Orange
is 5G-ready. After an initial commercial launch in Romania in
November 2019, 5G will start to be rolled out in 2020 in most of the
European countries where the Group operates. Once it has been
launched, 5G will allow for much faster broadband speeds than 4G
and will provide greater capacity. From 2023, when the core networks
will move to 5G, Orange will be in a position to offer lower latency and
to implement network slicing by prioritizing certain network slices to
cover critical usage or specific needs. 5G will, in addition, gradually
become more energy efficient than other mobile networks and will be
nearly ten times as efficient by 2025, absorbing the growth in
customers’ data consumption without increasing energy consumption.

Research and development

Signaling network

Orange operates an international signaling network to manage the
signaling associated with the voice traffic, roaming and text messaging
of its mobile networks and those of its operator customers. This
network is developing so that it can handle, in addition to SS7
standards, new standards such as IP SIGTRAN and DIAMETER.

In addition, several centralized platforms were rolled out on the
international transit points to provide value-added services to mobile
operators.

Research and development

€672 million (i.e. 1.6% of revenue) to them including employee costs,
as well as operating and investment expenditure related to research
and innovation for new products and services.

This efficiency is, in particular, the result of the deep-sleep mode for
base station equipment which Orange promoted (through the NGMN
alliance) with 83GPP, the standards organization for 4G and 5G. 5G
technical performance will support lots of new uses for the retail
market (immersive videos, online games), and for business customers
(optimization of production times, machine remote control, predictive
maintenance, etc.). Orange has launched a number of initiatives to
stimulate innovation and enable start-ups and its partners to test their
current and future solutions under 5G coverage. The Group has also
announced lots of co-innovation projects with companies in Europe
0 develop future uses of 5G.

Orange is continuing to roll out dedicated loT networks in Europe
(LoRaWAN® and LTE-M). In June 2019, AT&T, KPN, Orange and
Swisscom activated data roaming between their LTE-M networks to
benefit from continuity of service on several North American and
European networks. On the Enterprise market, Orange launched
Smart Operations in France, a solution aimed at businesses and local
authorities that includes the supply of sensors, secure connectivity to
he LoRaWAN® network and the business management interface. On
he French retail market, Maison Protégée, a telemonitoring offer, and
Maison Connectée, a service to connect devices directly to the Livebox,
operate them remotely, monitor their use and analyze their
consumption, were marketed in February 2019. In September 2019,
in Spain, Orange launched Smart Home, a home automation and
security system for retail customers.

Orange is also focusing its connectivity innovation on the virtualization
of networks (which allows the emergence of new services and offers
greater flexibility) as well as their automation. So-called Self-Organizing
Network (SON) features are integrated in mobile networks.

In terms of the environment, Orange is a pioneer in its sector and in
2017, 2018 and 2019 attained its objective of reducing CO, emissions
per customer by 50% compared to 2006. The Green ITN 2020
program, which already allowed to limit the Group energy consumption
linked to the operation of networks and IS (see Section 4.4.2.1 Network
energy consumption), will continue with the new Engage 2025 strategic
plan and will, in particular, rely on 5G energy efficiency as well as on
the use of data and Al, to further reduce energy consumption from
network components.

Research and development

In terms of sustainable innovation and green networks, Orange’s
commitment is reflected in its eco-design and circular economy
approach, illustrated by the more compact Livebox 4, which is
manufactured without any soldered parts to make it easier to
disassemble and recycle. This approach is also illustrated by virtuous
business partnerships such as the distribution of Fairphone2 and then
Fairphone 3, a terminal designed using recycled materials from
conflict-free zones.

With Livebox 5, launched in 2019, dedicated to fiber and bringing in
boosted download speeds, Orange took one step further in its initiative
‘Oo reduce its equipment’s carbon footprint: with a case made from
100% recycled plastic, a lighter and more compact construction,
‘ewer electronic components (making it easier to repair and recycle)
and a new design allowing for passive ventilation, without a fan.

n Africa, Orange is marketing a 4G version of the Sanza Phone, the
“Sanza XL.” Available in seven countries in Africa and the Middle East
rom December 2019, it will also be made available in other group
countries in 2020. Orange, a key player in terms of digital inclusion in
Africa and the Middle East, thus reaffirmed its commitment to support
its customers and offer Internet access for all.

Orange research and innovation activities are developed within the
framework of an open innovation strategy to capture trends, find
original solutions and benefit from partners’ skills and contributions.

1.6.2

Intellectual Property and Licensing protects, manages and adds value
to Orange’s patent portfolio, which are among the Group’s intangible
assets. It also adds value to software. It is an asset that sets Orange
apart from its academic and industry partners. Its role is also to defend
the Group’s interests in the event of disputes relating to intellectual
property.

On December 31, 2019, the Orange Group had a portfolio of
7,906 patents or patent applications in France and abroad protecting
its innovations. In order to maximize their value, some of these patents
are licensed through patent pools for patents relating to industry
standards (e.g. NFC, MPEG Audio, WiFi, HEVC). Value maximization

1.6.3

The Orange group plays an important role in financing innovation in
the IT industry, drawing on various investment vectors:

Capital investment

= Orange Digital Ventures, which is wholly-owned by the Group and
which has signed up to Orange’s Open Innovation strategy, through
which the Group acquires minority holdings in innovative start-ups,
particularly in the areas of new types of connectivity, corporate
digital services (SaaS, Big Data, artificial intelligence, security,
digitization of processes, etc.), Mobile Banking and mobile payment
(FinTech), Internet of Things, and digital services for the Africa and
Middle East region.

This approach has two objectives: one of a financial nature (to
generate capital gains on disposals) and the other to gain insight
into new markets, disruptive business models and agile project
management. In addition, start-ups not only obtain a source of
financing, but also benefit from the Group’s expertise and, where
appropriate, its customer relationships (in particular B2B).

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

This happens in a number of ways:

= Orange signed 90 research contracts between 2017 and 2019 with
he finest University laboratories in the world and furthermore set
up two joint laboratories: with Inria, on the virtualization of network
unctions, and with the University of Nice on antennae. Orange is
also greatly involved in the b<>com Institut de Recherche Technologique
and contributes to over 60 domestic and European cooperative
projects, including through its involvement in eight competitiveness
clusters (including being the chair of the Images & Réseaux cluster)
as part of a network of more than 3,000 industrial and academic
players. Orange also funds six research chairs, including one with the
nstitut Mines-Télécom on the Values and Policies of Personal Data;

= in 2019, Orange supported more than 1,000 start-ups via its
initiatives, which included the Orange Fab program which, in late
2019, helped to boost the growth of more than 450 start-ups in
18 countries on 4 continents. Orange also has a presence in various
global networks and events, notably in the French Tech network
and at the Viva Technology conference;

= the API program distributes Orange Application Programming
Interfaces in the areas of identification, payment, communications,
loT and data. It has generated exponential growth in APIs over the
last five years, supporting the opening of more than 1,250 APIs at
end-2019 across all the Group’s regions;

= lastly, Orange has an active policy of forming strategic partnerships
with leading industrial players worldwide, which allows it to enhance
its portfolio of products and services and open itself to new
ecosystems.

Intellectual Property and Licensing

also concerns software such as engineering tools for the mobile
network.

In 2019, 230 new inventions were protected by patents, including
major technical contributions to standardization (5G, coding, video,
etc.). The Orange Labs network in France and abroad accounts for
the bulk of the Group’s inventions. In 2018, Orange ranked among the
top three telecoms operators who filed patents in Europe (source:
European Patents Office, Top 25 applicants per leading field of Digital
Communication in 2018) and among the top 15 applicants across all
industries in France (source: INPI, 2018 award for leading patent
applicants).

In 2019, this approach was taken in relation to investment in three
new start-ups: Cycloid (DevOps, France), Raisin (FinTech, Germany)
and InterCloud (new connectivities, France). A number of portfolio
start-ups were also refinanced, bringing the total invested in this
scheme since 2015 to nearly €80 million invested in 23 start-ups.

As part of its new Engage 2025 strategy, Orange announced its
intention to strengthen its capital venture facility, by increasing the
sums allocated by the Group to €350 million.

= external investment funds, managed by independent management
companies in which Orange has generally invested with other
investors, mostly industrial companies, but occasionally also
involving purely financial firms. These include:

— the Iris Next fund and the three Orange Publicis Ventures funds
(Growth, Global and Early-Stage), created within the framework
of a partnership with the Publicis Group, and managed by Iris

Capital Management in which the Group is also involved at the
governance level,

— two funds that invest mainly in Africa: Partech Africa, managed
by Partech Partners, and the Franco-African Fund, managed by
Africinvest,

— several other “thematic” funds, including Robolution Capital
(focusing on robotics investments), which is managed by
360 Capital Partners, and Ecomobilité Ventures (focusing on
digital and sustainable mobility investments), managed by Idinvest
Partners.

1.7

1.7.1

In most of the countries where it operates, the Orange Group must
comply with various regulatory obligations governing the provision of
its products and services, primarily relating to obtaining and renewing
telecommunication licenses, as well as to oversight by authorities
seeking to maintain effective competition in electronic communications
markets. Orange also faces specific regulatory constraints in some
countries as a result of its historically dominant position in the fixed
telecommunications market. The risks linked to the regulation of the
electronic communications sector are described in Section 2.1.2 Legal
risks.

1.7.1.1 European Union

1.7.1.1.1 Legal and regulatory framework

The European Union has laid down a common legal framework aimed
at harmonizing the regulation of electronic communications. Itis binding
on the member states and must be implemented by the National
Regulatory Authorities.

The general legal framework of the European Union has been amended
by the new European Electronic Communications Code, which came
into effect on December 20, 2018. The revised code includes four
main directives deriving from the 2002 Telecoms Package on:

Regulation of activities

In 2019, the Orange Group, which had already invested in the private
equity firm, Raise Investissement, in 2014 and 2016, chose to invest
in Raise Ventures, a Venture Capital structure focusing on innovative
start-ups in France and Europe. In 2019, the Group also finalized a
minor reinvestment in the Seedcamp4 fund focusing on investment in
start-ups during the seed phase.

Overall, for its private equity business, the Group’s financial investment
commitments (made via direct and indirect equity investments) total
more than €295 million over the last ten years.

Regulation of telecommunication activities

= acommon regulatory framework for electronic communications
networks and services;

= the authorization of electronic communications networks and services;

= access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks
and associated facilities;

= universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic
communications networks and services.

n addition, the Telecoms Package includes the directive on Privacy
and electronic communications No. 2002/58/EC of July 12, 2002,
concerning the processing of personal data and the protection o
privacy in the electronic communications sector.

Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No. 1211-2009 of November 25, 2009,
canceled and replaced by Regulation (EU) No. 2018-1971 o
December 11, 2018, implemented the Body of European Regulators
‘or Electronic Communications (BEREC).

This legal framework is supplemented by sectoral texts (international
roaming, open Internet, etc.) as well as more general texts aimed a’
he European digital ecosystem (protection of privacy, digital taxation,
etc.).

The European Electronic Communications Code

The new European Electronic Communications Code was published
in the Official Journal of the European Union on December 17, 2018
(EU Directive 2018-1972). It took effect on December 20, 2018. The
Member States have 24 months to transpose it into national law.

and adoption of very high connectivity networks — in line with Orange’s
wish to see regulatory objectives redirected toward support for investment.

In addition, the rules governing the access obligations imposed on
operators with significant market power have been adjusted in a
positive way:

= access obligations must better target only relevant fixed access
infrastructures in order to address competition issues in the market;

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

‘| — Overview of the Group and of its business

Regulation of activities

= emphasis is placed on co-investment in very high connectivity
networks. If an operator in a dominant position makes a co-investmen
offer that complies with certain provisions, it could be exempted
from remedies related to its dominant status. Only co-investors wi
have access to the full capacity of these networks. The other
operators will be able to enjoy the same quality of wholesale access
as they did before the roll-out of these networks. National regulators
will need to secure approval from the European Commission for al
measures taken in this context;

= in addition, the Code favors the wholesale operator model — no’
present on the retail market — by exempting it from certain remedies
in cases of market dominance.

What is more, obligations for access to fixed access infrastructures
serving subscribers may be imposed symmetrically on all operators
where it is not technically possible or economically reasonable to
replicate such infrastructures. These obligations are subject to a joint
veto by the Commission and BEREC.

Concerning the allocation of radio frequencies needed for mobile
services, the Code reinforces European rules aimed at improved
harmonization and cooperation between Member States, including
he minimum 20-year visibility of spectrum licenses. The
implementation and in particular the allocation of spectral capacity
remains a national affair with only light supervision from Europe.
Provisions facilitating the deployment of “small-area wireless access
points” (defined in Article 2.23 of the Code) and the availability schedule
of the 5G spectrum were also adopted.

With respect to the regulation of communication services, most of
he obligations intended to protect end-users are for Internet access
service and services using public numbering plan resources,
independently of the service provider. Other services, such as
interpersonal communication services independent of the numbering
plan and signal transport services are only subject to a limited number
of obligations.

However, regulation of the competitive markets for intra-European
calls and SMS has been introduced with the Code through (EU)
Regulation 2018-1971 of December 11, 2018, imposing a cap of 19 euro
cents/minute and 6 euro cents/SMS, applicable since May 15, 2019.

Concerning universal service obligations, the Code abandons the
principle of telephone service provision and calls on Member States
‘o ensure the availability of affordable Internet access service, upholding
he principle of potential designation should Member States consider
hat the market does not provide such services under said conditions,
but increasing the burden of proof for Member States. The system of
inancing the universal service remains in the hands of the Member
States, with coverage from public funds or from a fund financed by
he sector. In addition, the Code opens the door to an extension of
universal service obligations to include the supply of affordable mobile
services.

The Code and its associated regulation on changes in BEREC’s
responsibilities and governance do not create a European regulator.
However, the Code does adopt the principle of full standardization of
the rights of end-users, subject to exceptions, and strengthens the
control exercised by the European Commission over access regulation
and over the spectrum.

In this framework, the ORECE must publish guidelines in order to help
national regulators implement the Code.

Harmonization of analyses of relevant markets

On October 9, 2014, the European Commission adopted a new
recommendation (2014/7 10/EC) identifying four relevant product and
service markets for which National Regulatory Authorities are required
tocarry out market analyses potentially resulting in the implementation
of ex-ante regulation, as opposed to seven in its previous
recommendation of 2007:

M 1: wholesale call termination on individual public telephone
networks provided at a fixed location;

M 2: wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks;

M 3/a: wholesale local access provided at a fixed location;

M 3/b: wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for
mass-market products;

M 4: wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location.

The European Commission has begun work aimed at reviewing this
recommendation set out by the new Code.

Call termination rates

On May 7, 2009, the European Commission adopted a recommendation
(2009/396/EC) regulating fixed and mobile voice call termination rates
in the European Union. The Commission recommends that National
Regulatory Authorities should apply the following principles:

= symmetry in each Member State, first between the various operators’
ixed-line voice call termination rates and second between their
mobile call termination rates, with the option of allowing a four-year
ransitional asymmetry on fixed or mobile call termination rates for
any new entrants;

= call termination rates geared towards the avoidable cost of this
service for an efficient operator (i.e. about 1 euro cent per minute
‘or voice MTRs and a lower rate for voice FTRs).

International roaming

Regulation (EU) No. 2015-2120 of November 25, 2015"), which aims
to eliminate surcharges for international roaming within the European

Union and Regulation (EU) No. 2017/920 of May 17, 2017, which lays
down the rules for wholesale roaming markets: ?

= impose, in the context of fair usage, the alignment of international
roaming retail prices with national prices for intra-European
communications (voice, SMS and data) from June 15, 2017;

= expands, for customers using their cellphones outside the EU,
pricing transparency requirements and bill shock prevention
measures for European operators;

= grant a regulated right of access to European roaming services for MVNOs and resellers, and sets new caps on wholesale markets:

— voice: €0.032 per minute excluding VAT starting on June 15, 2017,

— SMS: €0.01 per SMS excluding VAT from June 15, 2017,
— data (price excluding sales tax):

Suppliers of mobile services subject to the regulation on the pricing of
intra-European roaming may apply a reasonable usage policy to their
customers in terms of the consumption of these services in order to
prevent abnormal or excessive use. Despite this option, in special and
exceptional circumstances, when the supply of intra-European roaming
at the national price threatens the viability of the supplier’s national
pricing model, they can ask the national regulator for authorization to
bill additional charges for the use of intra-European roaming, which
are limited to the caps on wholesale roaming prices.

On November 29, 2019, the European Commission published a report
on the state of the roaming market in the European Union. It noted
he satisfactory impact of its regulation and the compliant implementation
hereof by operators, envisaging the extension of wholesale marke’
regulation beyond 2022. The Commission also noted that there is
evidence of an economic space between the wholesale caps through
2022 and the cost levels of operators. However, it considers that a
urther reduction in these caps, in order to have even more efficien
Roaming Like at Home, needs fuller and broader analysis, in particular
o ensure the efficient functioning of domestic markets. The
Commission has announced that during the first half of 2020 it will be

working on an impact assessment of a possible legislative proposa
‘oO amend the current wholesale pricing framework, while holding a
public consultation process at the same time.

(1) Telecom Single Market, or TSM.

Regulation of the open Internet

The TSM Regulation has introduced rules to ensure an open Internet
within the European Union. Article 3.3 of the TSM states that in the
provision of Internet access services, providers shall treat traffic equally
and without discrimination, restriction or interference, irrespective of
sender and recipient, the content consulted or broadcast, the
applications or services used or provided, and the terminal equipment
used. It is up to the Member States to adapt their national law to
comply with this provision.

On April 30, 2019, the European Commission published a report on
the implementation of the net neutrality component of the TSM
Regulation. The Commission, in the light of market developments,
concluded that the principles of the Regulation are appropriate and
that they effectively protect end-users by promoting the Internet as a
driver of innovation. The Commission pointed out that operators have
correctly applied the regulation governing net neutrality and that
national regulators have imposed very few fines. It does not propose
any amendments to this Regulation. On the basis of this Commission
report, BEREC has started work on updating the guidelines for a
harmonized application of the TSM Regulation within the Union with
a view to ensuring an open Internet. This process should be wrapped
up in the first half of 2020.

(2) These rules amended Regulation No. 531/2012 of June 13, 2012 on roaming using public mobile communications networks within the Union (Roaming Ili). These new roaming rules go
by the name of “Roaming-Like-At-Home”. They are rounded out by an implementing regulation on reasonable usage rules for intra-European roaming adopted on December 15, 2016.

Regulation of activities

Protecting Personal Data

The new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect
on May 25, 2018. The GDPR, which replaces a 1995 European
directive, is a general-purpose regulation intended for both public and
private entities which harmonizes the management of personal data
protection in Europe.

GDPR principles include:

= single rules directly applicable immediately in each European Union
country;

= application to all Internet users and service providers of the
information society intended for the European market;

= asingle supervisory authority responsible for the protection of data
as the interlocutor for Internet companies: that of the Union country
in which they have their primary office;

= unambiguous consent which explicitly covers the processing of
personal data;

= definition of apseudonymization process whose use is encouraged;

= strengthening of the obligation to provide information to consumers;

= the introduction of a “digital right to be forgotten.”

National authorities for the protection of personal data now have
greater powers. In particular, they may impose administrative penalties
of up to 4% of total annual revenue on companies that infringe
European rules. In addition, the coming into force of the GDPR has
indirect effects on the implementation of sector Directive No.
2002/58/EC on Privacy and electronic communications of July 12,
2002, given that it changes the meaning of the concept of consent
and the penalties to which this sector directive refers. The Commission
wants to replace the 2002 directive with a new sector regulation, but
here has been no political agreement on the new text.

The European Commission is due to submit a report on the evaluation
and review of the GDPR to the European Parliament and Council of
he European Union before May 25, 2020.

Regulation of platforms

Regulation (EU) 2019-1150 promoting fairness and transparency for
businesses using online intermediation services was adopted on
June 20, 2019 and will be applicable as of July 12, 2020. It aims to
ensure rules for a fair, transparent and predictable trading environment
or businesses and vendors on online platforms. The European
Commission is to propose guidelines on the transparency rules applied
0 information given to users on platforms. It is due to evaluate the
regulation at the end of 2021 and may publish new legislative proposals.

Taxation of digital technology

To a backdrop of digitization of the economy, Orange is supporting
he OECD's efforts to find an agreement on the taxation of profits
reported by multinationals. In the absence of an agreement on the
single digital tax at a European level in May 2019, Member States have
decided to support an agreement for a global solution at the OECD
level. However, the President of the European Commission stated in
her roadmap: “If, by the end of 2020, there is still no global solution
or a fair digital tax, the European Union should act alone”.

n France, Law No. 2019/759 pertaining to digital services, promulgated
on July 24, 2019, applies retroactively to digital service revenues as
of January 1, 2019. Digital services are taxed at 3% of gross revenues
rom intermediary services and advertising based on user data, on the
condition that revenues exceed 750 million euros worldwide and
25 million euros in France.

Legal framework

The electronic communications sector is primarily governed by the
French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE) as well
as legal provisions relating to e-commerce, the information society,
consumer protection and personal data protection.

France transposed the European Telecoms Package, as amended in
2009, via the order of August 24, 2011 and the decree of March 12,
2012 for the implementing regulations. Transposition of the new
European Codeis in progress and should be implemented via decrees.
A public consultation process was launched in early 2020 by the
Ministry responsible for Electronic Communications.

The audiovisual communication services produced or distributed by
the Orange Group come under the specific regulations governing this
sector and are governed by law no. 86-1067 of September 30, 1986
on the Freedom of Communication.

Regulatory Authorities

The Postal, Electronic Communications and Media Distribution
Regulatory Authority (Arcep) is an independent administrative body
created by the Act of July 26, 1996 and is in charge of the nationwide
regulation of the electronic communications and postal sectors. Within
he electronic communications sector, Arcep’s main missions are to
define regulations for operators present in the markets in question. It
has powers to sanction non-compliant operators and can rule on
disputes between operators over technical and pricing conditions for
network access and interconnection. Arcep also allocates spectrum
and numbering resources. Finally, it determines the size of contributions
‘0 fund the universal service obligation and oversees the mechanisms
or delivering this funding.

The French Competition Authority is an independent government
authority responsible for ensuring open market competition and
compliance with public economic policy. It has jurisdiction over all
business segments, including the electronic communications sector.
has sanction powers for anti-competitive practices, as well as
consultative powers. It is also responsible for overseeing mergers and
acquisitions.

Cc

he ANFr (Agence nationale des fréquences — French national agency
‘or frequencies) is responsible for planning, managing and controlling
he usage of radio frequencies and for coordinating the establishment
of certain radio transmission facilities. The frequency spectrum is
covered by 11 controlling authorities: government departments, Arcep
and the French Broadcasting Authority (CSA). Arcep and the CSA are
n turn responsible for allotting to users the frequencies they control.

The CSA (Conseil Supérieur de |’Audiovisuel) is an independent
administrative body created by the law of January 17, 1989. It is
tasked with protecting the freedom of audiovisual communication in
accordance with the law of September 30, 1986.

The draft bill on audiovisual communication and cultural sovereignty
in the digital age, presented to the Council of Ministers on December 5,
2019, proposes to merge the CSA and the Higher Authority for the
Distribution of Works and the Protection of Rights on the Internet
(Hadopi) into a new entity to be called the Regulatory Authority for
Audiovisual and Digital Communication (ARCOM). Both chambers will
examine this bill as from the first half of 2020. This text should also
contain the powers that will enable the Government to transpose by
decree the new European Electronic Communications Code.

Regulation of activities

December 2018 (Decision No. 2018-1392) for 10 years as from the
expiry of the previous authorizations.

The Government’s 5G Strategy (3.4-3.8 GHz, 26 GHz and
1.4 GHz)

The Government and Arcep provided information about the road map
for 5G in France on July 16, 2018.

Three bands were targeted: the 3.4 - 3.8 GHz band, the 26 GHz band
and the 1.4 GHz band. A first consultation was launched on October 26,
2018 on the allocation of new frequencies for 5G in these three bands.

3.4-3.8 GHz band

On November 21, 2019, Arcep presented to the French government
and published proposed specifications relating to the allocation of 5G
frequencies (3.4-3.8 GHz band). These aimed to respond to the
Government's request, firstly to ensure continued digital development
across the country, and secondly to support the growth in uses and
the emergence of new services.

The Directorate General for Enterprise then put out the two texts for
public consultation through December 12, 2019, enabling the official
launch of the allocation procedure:

= the text approving the proposed Arcep specifications, and setting
the reserve prices (350 million euros for each of the 50 MHz blocks
allocated in stage 1 and 70 million euros per 10 MHz block allocated
in stage 2);

= and the text setting out the terms and conditions of payment.

On December 17, 2019, Arcep published its opinion on these two
texts, highlighting the Government's plan to spread the payment of
the sums relating to stage 1 over 15 years. On this basis, the authority
issued a favorable opinion on the Government's draft texts.

Anew stage was reached on December 31, 2019 with the publication
in the official journal of the decree and order reiterating these
Government decisions (for the 3.4 — 3.8 GHz “core band”). This
publication officially launched the allocation procedure, conducted by
Arcep on the basis of the specifications published November 21,
2019. Candidates had until February 25, 2020 to prepare and submit
their applications.

The allocation concerns 310 MHz, i.e. the 3,490-3,800 MHz band.
The procedure involves three stages and should ultimately lead to the
issue of a frequency authorization for Orange around mid-May 2020.
Over both stages, qualified applicants must acquire a quantity of
spectrum between a minimum of 40 MHz and amaximum of 100 MHz.

Stage 1:

= all candidates submit an application file - accompanied by a bank
guarantee - and subscribe to all the obligations (see below).
Qualification will be based on these application files;

= those who wish to subscribe to optional commitments: these
candidates will then be allocated a quantity of 50 MHz at the reserve
price of 350 million euros, payment of which will be spread over
15 years;

= applicants who have not subscribed to the optional commitments
do not obtain spectrum at this stage.

Stage 2:

= the rest of the spectrum is allocated by way of a purely financial
multi-round auction;

= all qualified candidates may take part in this stage;

= those who have not subscribed to the optional commitments in
Stage 1 must participate in this Stage 2 to acquire the minimum
spectrum provided for in the procedure: they will therefore need to
acquire all their spectrum in Stage 2, at the final auction price.

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document

Stage 3:

= the purpose of this stage is to position the frequencies obtained by
each of the applicants within the frequency band concerned,
according to new price offers that they submit all in one go.

Dateline:

Stage 1 proceeded normally with application files submitted on or
before February 25.

With respect to stages 2 and 3, however, due to the health crisis,
Arcep announced on April 2, 2020, the postponement of the auction
for an indefinite period which will depend on the development of the
situation. Arcep has nevertheless confirmed that candidates who have
subscribed to the commitments will be allocated a 50 MHz block at
the end of the allocation procedure for an amont of 350 million euros.

The period of authorization is 15 years with the possibility of a 5-year
extension under as yet unknown conditions. Arcep has introduced a
condition for secondary use of frequencies by third parties, the
conditions of which will be defined after consultation with operators.

Obligations and commitments in detail:

Candidates qualified at the end of Stage 1 will need to comply with
a number of obligations:

=

.Commercial opening of at least 2 cities with at least
150,000 inhabitants before the end of 2020.

Nh

. Roll-out of sites in the 3.5 GHz band:
— 3,000 sites end 2022,
— 8,000 sites end 2024,
— 10,500 sites end 2025,

— 25% of the sites deployed with 3.5 GHz end 2024 and end 2025
must be located in rural areas or industrial zones outside of very
densely populated areas,

— widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by end 2030,
an obligation that may be met either with the 3.5 GHz band or
with another band.

3. Increase in speed (at least 240 Mbit/s, meaning, for example,
deploying 4G in 800 MHz band and in 1,800 MHz band at each site):

— 75% of sites end 2022,
— 85% of sites end 2024,
— 90% of sites end 2025,
— 100% of sites end 2030.

4. Coverage of highways:

— coverage of all expressways/motorways (16,642 km) by end
2025 with a speed of 100 Mbits/second,

— coverage of major highways or ARIs (64,913 km):
— all ARIs at 50 Mbits/sec. “in car” by end 2025,

— all ARIs at 100 Mbits/sec. “out of car” by end 2027.

5. Other obligations: provide differentiated services (slicing), activate
Pv6.

The commitments to be made to compete in Stage 1 for the 50 MHz
lots at the reserve price are as follows:

1. From the end of 20238, provision of a fixed offering from sites using
he 3.5 GHz band and provision of a fixed offering to cover premises
hat benefit from “radio local loop” service.

2. Respond to reasonable requests from “verticals”.

38. Indoor coverage.

4. MVNO hosting.

5. Plus commitments to transparency concerning network outages
and transparency with planned deployments.

26 GHz band

The government and Arcep called for the creation of experimentation
platforms by way of an open window in January 2019. Named in
October 2019, the ten or so winners of authorizations will be able to
experiment with 5G in this frequency band for a period of 3 years.
Orange has obtained two authorizations, one for the Chatillon campus
and the other for a project with the SNCF (French Rail) at Rennes
station.

Extension of frequency authorizations for Reunion and
Mayotte

In its Decision No. 2019-1753, Arcep extended authorizations to use
frequencies allocated to Orange in the 900 MHz band in Mayotte and
in the 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz bands in Reunion. This extension
brought the expiry dates of these two authorizations into line with
those of other operators in these two territories.

Mobile coverage
The New Deal agreement
Under the New Deal, operators are committed to:

= expanding the coverage of metropolitan France by way of the
“targeted coverage” scheme, making it possible for each operator
to cover 5,000 new areas (most of which are shared between
operators), replacing the three existing programs (town center dead’
zones, 800 strategic sites and the France Mobile program), which
will now be fully paid for by the operators;

Overview of the Group and of its business —— 1

Regulation of activities

= generalizing access to very high-speed broadband by introducing
4G with a power rating in excess of 5W to all their own mobile sites
by the end of 2020, and to 75% of the sites in the town center dead
zone program by the end of 2020, upping this to 100% by the end
of 2022;

= accelerating the coverage of transport routes, ensuring that main
highway and rail routes have 4G coverage. The agreement also
includes provisions for the coverage of regional train networks;

= improving coverage inside buildings, in two components: the gradual

availability of voice and SMS services via Wi-Fi with the goal of

enabling 80% of our customers who own a compatible handset to
benefit from these services by the end of 2019; and the marketing
of an offering allowing public companies and individuals who so
request to obtain improved indoor multi-operator coverage of their
buildings at a reasonable rate;

= improving reception quality throughout the country, and particularly
in rural areas. The new performance standard applied to operator
obligations will be that of “good coverage” defined as the “ability to
be able to call and text SMS outside of buildings in most cases and
within buildings in some cases”.

These obligations have been written into their current authorizations
and in the newly allocated 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2.1 GHz band
authorizations for 10 years.

Regulation of activities

Additionally, operators are obliged to provide a mobile radiotelephone
service under the “good coverage” conditions set out by Arcep to
99.6% of the population by March 2024 at the latest, and to 99.8%
by March 2028.

In June 2019, Arcep launched a penalty procedure against the four
network operators concerning the deployment of the first sites under
the “New Deal”. The first deadline for the deployment of mobile sites
is the end of June 2020.

At end-December 2019, Orange’s 4G coverage was 99% of the
population and 88% of the country.

Infrastructure sharing

The New Deal agreement contains clauses relating to the pooling of
etworks, including active sharing where all four operators are present
na site as part of the targeted coverage arrangements. A mobile site
haring contract was signed in July 2019 between the four network
jperators for the deployment of 4G on sites destined to be actively
hared. This agreement is gradually being implemented for the sites
the Town Center Dead Zones program and the new sites to be
deployed as part of the New Deal’s targeted coverage scheme.

Orange’s obligations regarding cost accounting and
accounting separation for the mobile business

On June 19, 2018, Arcep published Decision No. 2018-0685 specifying
obligations for accounting for and the reporting of costs imposed on
mobile operators. The decision supersedes Decision No. 2013-0520.
As was the case for the previous decision, it applies to Orange, SFR,
Bouygues Telecom, Free Mobile, SRR and Orange Carailbes. The new
decision primarily simplifies operator obligations.

Analysis of the wholesale mobile call termination markets

The fixed and mobile termination markets are regulated by Arcep
Decision No. 2017-1453 for the 2017-2020 cycle. The decision
confirms the cost-orientation obligation for call termination rates. The
cap levels for call termination were eliminated in the final decision.
Mobile operators, including Orange, have left their rates unchanged
since 2017.
1.7.1.2.4 Regulation of fixed-line telephony,
broadband and very high-speed
broadband Internet

Regulation of fiber optic networks

Regulatory framework governing very high-speed
broadband wholesale offers

The current regulatory framework for the deployment of very
high-speed broadband in France confirms the principle of symmetric
regulation for the terminating segment of networks, and encourages
sharing by operators, with potential co-financing following prior
consultation with the municipality:

= principle of sharing the terminating segment of networks between
operators;

= symmetric regulation for access to the terminating segment of
networks, including outside of very densely populated areas: same
obligation to provide passive access to the terminating segment of
FTTH networks under reasonable and_ non-discriminatory
conditions, applicable to all operators equipping buildings with fiber
optic in the entire French territory. Access must be from a reasonably
located shared access point (Arcep Decision No. 2009-1106
supplemented by Arcep Decision No. 2010-1312 for less densely
populated areas). Tariffs must be reasonable and respect the
principles of efficiency, relevance, objectivity and non-discrimination;

Next Generation Access network.
Optical Connection Node.

= no ex-ante regulation of retail prices;

= asymmetric regulation of access to civil engineering infrastructure
which allows alternative operators to deploy their horizontal networks
on Orange’s infrastructure: non-discriminatory access at a rate that
reflects costs;

= no obligation for asymmetric access (unbundling or bitstream) for
fiber, confirmed by the 3a and 3b market analysis decisions published
by Arcep on December 14, 2017.

Arcep is of the opinion that the FTTH regulatory framework it decided
on complies with the principles defined by the European Commission
in its NGA” recommendation, applicable to broadband and very
high-speed networks, published on September 20, 2010. It
recommends asymmetric regulation requiring that operators in a
dominant position provide access to the terminating segment of very
high-speed lines and access from OCNs” while conceding a risk
premium to operators who invest and an adaptation principle for
national circumstances. The European Commission approved Arcep’s
position.

Deployment commitments known as “L. 33-13” by Orange
in the AMII zone

n early 2018, Orange formalized its commitment proposals for FTTH
deployment in nearly 3,000 municipalities under Article L. 33-13 of the
Postal and Electronic Communications Code, confirming its prior
commitments taken under the AMII® in 2011, then in 2013 and 2015.

Orange proposed that it commit to ensuring that, within its FTTH
deployment scope in the AMII area: (i) by the end of 2020, 100% of
homes and professional premises would have access to FTTH sales
offers (including a maximum 8% of premises connectable on demand,
excluding refusals by third parties), and (ii) by the end of 2022, 100%
of homes and professional premises would be made connectable
(excluding refusals by third parties).

These commitment proposals took into account the agreement
reached at the end of May 2018 by Orange and SFR which led to
Orange withdrawing from 236 municipalities to SFR’s benefit.

Following the Arcep opinion of June 12, 2018, Orange’s commitment
proposals (and those of SFR) were accepted by the French government
on July 26, 2018”).

AMEL and equity funded deployments

n December 2017, the Government announced the launch of a
procedure calling for shows of local commitments (AMEL) through
which to identify operators wishing to deploy privately-funded FTTH
beyond the current AMIl zone.

Orange proposed to make commitments with respect to Article
L. 33-13 under AMEL for the French departments of Lot-et-Garonne,
Vienne, Deux-Sévres and Haute-Vienne. Arcep issued a favorable
opinion in April 2019 on Orange’s proposed commitments in Lot-et-
Garonne, and these commitments were accepted by the government
in May 2019. Arcep issued a favorable opinion in January 2020 on
Orange’s proposed commitments in Haute Vienne.

In addition, Orange proposed to the Government commitments under
Article L. 33-13 in the context of deployment projects using its own
funds. These commitments are currently being examined by the
authorities.

Completeness of FTTH networks

Arcep Officially notified Orange that it must comply with the obligation
for completeness of a list of 460 shared access points first
commissioned more than 5 years ago (as listed in the appendix of its
Decision No. 2018-1597 —RDP)), at the latest by December 31, 2019.

Orange is required to prove its compliance with the obligation for
completeness of the 460 shared access points by January 31, 2020,
at the latest, or to explain the difficulties encountered. Arcep stated in
this respect that, “if Orange were to report exceptional difficulties
which prevent it from making certain premises connectable, Orange
should submit all appropriate supporting evidence demonstrating that
it had implemented the resources required to resolve the issues, but
that they persisted.”

Regulatory framework for unbundling the local copper loop

Rates framework

On December 21, 2017, Arcep passed a decision on the rates
ramework for the full unbundling of the local copper loop for 2018 to
2020, excluding any specific taxation. This decision set a cap for the
monthly recurring tariff for fully unbundled access (€9.31 in 2018,
€9.41 in 2019 and €9.51 in 2020), as well as for the monthly recurring
ariff for naked Bitstream access (€13.19 in 2018, €13.30 in 2019
and €13.41 in 2020).

n accordance with Arcep decision, the changes planned for the full
unbundling rates and for naked ADSL for 2019 and 2020 were adjusted
0 take into account the changes to the Imposition Forfaitaire sur les
Entreprises de Réseau (|FER) (flat-rate tax on certain network assets).
The tax, which was only for copper lines, was broadened to include
cabled networks and FTTH. Lines built less than five years ago are
exempted. In accordance with the principle of non-discrimination, part
of the decrease in the tax paid by Orange is passed on to the alternative
operators via a reduction in wholesale rates.

Based on the new /FER value, the tariffs for the year 2019 were
€9.27/month for full unbundling and €13.16/month for naked DSL
access for 2019. For 2020, they are €9.46/month and €13.36/month
respectively for full unbundling and naked DSL access.

Analysis of the relevant markets

Broadband and very high-speed broadband markets

On December 14, 2017, Arcep published the following decisions
resulting from the fifth analysis cycle of the fixed broadband and very
high-speed broadband markets for the period from December 2017
to December 2020:

= Decision No. 2017-1347 for market 3a (wholesale local access
provided at a fixed location): unbundling on the copper local loop,
access to civil engineering infrastructure, passive access to the local
FTTH loop or bitstream with delivery to the optical connection node,
passive FTTH offer with quality of service;

= Decision No. 2017-1348 for market 3b (market for wholesale central
access provided at a fixed location for mass-market products):
regional copper bitstream or FTTH;

= Decision No. 2017-1349 for market 4 (high-quality wholesale
access): LPT, SDSL, FTTO and FTTE wholesale offers;

= Arcep Decision No. 2017-1488 of December 14, 2017 setting the
inancial conditions for access to the civil engineering infrastructure
of the Orange local loop which confirmed most of the rules previously
decided in 2010.

These decisions extend virtually all of the obligations previously imposed
on Orange, which remains the only dominant player in the various
markets.

Regulation of activities

nthe mass market, Arcep only preserved the symmetrical framework
or FTTH, and does not impose an obligation of equivalence of inputs
on Orange. Orange committed to (i) upgrading information systems
by September 1, 2018 for the eligibility processes and by December 31,
2018 for order processes, (ii) providing Arcep with commercial
contracts for optical connection nodes/shared points in very densely
populated areas, and (iii) reducing cases of proven difficulty in
connecting third party operators to Orange’s shared access points in
buildings by mid-2019.

n the Enterprise market, Orange saw its obligations in the wholesale
market increased by the introduction of new remedies:

= the obligation to provide an enhanced quality of service option on
its FTTH infrastructure;

5

= the obligation to provide a wholesale offer for passive access to the
local shared optical loop suited to new infrastructure players
dedicated to the intermediary market for activated access offers for
companies;

= the obligation to provide a resale offer for its retail offers for the
enterprise market (FTTH Pro).

On February 6, 2020, Arcep published a public consultation with a
view to revising the regulation of the fixed high-speed and very
high-speed broadband markets, following the “bilan & perspectives”
(review & outlook) consultation in July 2019, to which Orange
responded at the end of September.

Arcep is providing for consultation:

- 4 draft decisions for the analysis of the fixed high-speed and very
high-speed markets:

— market “4” activated offers in the enterprise market,

— market “Sb” activated offers in the mass market,

— market “3a”, passive offers,

— anew separate civil engineering market;

= a document to complement the symmetrical FTTH regulation,
applicable to all operators.

In particular, Arcep addresses the following topics, which are the main
issues for Orange in the next round of market analysis:

= support for the migration of access from copper to fiber with a view
‘o the eventual closure of the local copper loop network;

= the strengthening of the symmetrical framework for fiber regulation,
in particular with a view to rendering symmetrical the obligations
hat are currently imposed only on Orange (in particular as regards
access to enhanced quality of service for business customers);

Fixed-line telephony

As part of its fifth round of analysis of the relevant fixed-line markets
or non-residential customers for the 2018-2020 period, on
December 21, 2017, Arcep adopted Decision No. 2017-1568, which
restricts the obligation to formalize a wholesale offer for access to
elephone service to the non-residential market only.

Wholesale non-residential line rental rates are now governed by
Decision No. 2018-1523 of December 5, 2018. Contract caps are
stable for 2020 compared to previous caps (12.32 euro cents/month
‘or analog and 18.57 euro cents/month for digital). The cap for call
origination collected at the Operator Connection Point associated with
he contracts is €0.6584/minute in 2019 and will be €0.6958/minute
in 2020.

Following its Decision No. 2017-1453 of December 2017, Arcep
removed the rate caps for the 2018-2020 period. Rates must be
based on costs. Operators have left their tariffs unchanged since
2017.

Orange interconnection with Free and Free Mobile

The dispute between Orange and Free around IP interconnection was

Additionally, by its Decision No. 2019-0634 of April 23, 2019, Arcep
set the definitive assessment of the net cost of universal service and
operators’ contributions for the year 2017.

Following the opening of a penalty procedure (L. 36.11 of the French
Postal and Electronic Communications Code) by Arcep in June 2018,
Orange was given notice in October 2018 regarding its compliance
with universal service quality of service obligations. Arcep set
intermediate obligations for the months of November and
December 2018 and for each quarter of 2019.

Quality of service of wholesale offers for consumer and
enterprise markets

Following the opening of a penalty procedure (Article L. 36.11 of the

The CNMC, by its Decision 002/17/m2-2014 dated January 18, 2018,
set caps for traffic from the European Economic Area corresponding
to its long-run incremental cost model for an efficient generic operator
in line with the European recommendation. The caps adopted show
a gradual reduction in mobile termination rates from 1.09 euro
cents/min to 0.64 euro cents/min by January 2020. These prices
apply only to traffic coming from the European Economic Area.

Application of Roaming Like at Home regulation

In order to handle a massive increase in the volume of traffic in certain
customer categories, Orange submitted an exemption request to the
regulator UKE at the end of 2017, as authorized by the regulation"),
to bill its roaming customers a surcharge. In a decision dated April 12,
2019, the regulator renewed the exemption authorization that had
been granted in April 2018 for a period of one year. Orange implements
the application of these surcharges on voice and data only within the
framework of its prepaid offers. The authorized surcharges are:

= outgoing call: 0.0407 zloty/minute;
= incoming call: 0.0163 zloty/minute;
- SMS: 0.0081 Zloty;

= MMS/1 MB: 0.0015 zloty.
1.7.1.4.3 Regulation of fixed-line telephony,
broadband and very high-speed
broadband Internet

The ex-ante regulation of Orange’s fixed services, for the areas defined
as non-competitive, relates solely to wholesale offers.

Deregulation of markets 1 and 3/2003

On June 26, 2018, the European Commission approved the decisions
to deregulate markets 1 & 3/2003 (access to the public telephone
network at a fixed location for residential and non-residential
customers). The deregulation decision provides for a transition period
of two years corresponding to the maximum duration of the contracts
agreed by the operators and their private customers.
Analysis of the wholesale broadband market
(markets 3a and 3b/2014)

On October 22, 2019, UKE published the decisions relating to markets
3a and 3b/2014.

According to the regulator, market development and increasing
competition justify further market deregulation. As a result, UKE decided
to increase the number of deregulated zones:

= in the 3a/2014 market, to 51 municipalities;
= in the 3b/2014 market, from 76 to 151 municipalities.

Under these new decisions, out of a total of approximately 14.6 million
households, around 6 million households are deregulated on bitstream
access, and around 2.3 million households are deregulated on
bitstream access and unbundling.

Reference offer for fixed-line markets

The benchmark offer relates to all wholesale fixed services: call
origination and termination, wholesale subscription sales, partial and
full unbundling, and bitstream access.

Regulation of activities

On September 4, 2018, the European Commission accepted, without
comment, the changes made to the Orange reference offer intended
to lower subscription fees for the fixed-access wholesale service and
eliminate number portability fees.

Fixed-line call termination rates

On March 28, 2019, UKE notified its draft decision fixing the tariff for
fixed call terminations on the basis of costs incurred at 0.0273
zloty/minute. The European Commission, after having expressed
“serious doubts” as to the compatibility of this draft decision with the
European Commission’s 2009 recommendation on incremental cost
orientation, finally issued a recommendation to UKE on August 26,
2019, asking it to adopt a price level based on the incremental cost
model. However, UKE did not apply this recommendation in view of
the future European call termination rate and adopted its decision with
unchanged tariff levels; this decision was notified to operators at the
end of December.

of the 470-790 MHz frequency band in the European Union.

The timeline for future allocations has not been announced, but a
proposal for (i) the possible extension of the current non-5G licenses
and (ii) the ability to grant transitional rights to operators to open
commercial 5G services was submitted for public consultation on
December 24, 2019.

Mobile voice call terminations

In its decision dated May 26, 2017, the IBPT set the level of Orange’s
mobile call termination at 0.99 euro cents/min, based on the long-term
incremental cost model of an efficient generic operator.

Cable wholesale broadband markets

A consultation on the review of the markets was initiated by the
Conference of Regulators of the electronic communications sector in
July 2017). The review concluded that there were different wholesale

markets for central access (copper/fiber versus cable) and for television
(IP-TV versus cable). On May 25, 2018, the European Commission
commented on the draft decisions for the wholesale broadband
markets (markets 3a and 3b/2014) and on the wholesale television
distribution market. The European Commission did not block the
proposal to define two central access wholesale markets for the
copper and fiber optic networks and for coaxial cable, despite its
comments on the measure. On this basis, the CRC’s final decision
was adopted on June 29, 2018.

In the meantime, Telenet appealed to the European Court of Justice
(ECU) against the European Commission’s letter of observations on
this market analysis, then subsequently annulled this appeal. At the
same time, all cable operators (Telenet, Brutélé, Nethys) appealed
against these decisions to the Court of Justice for markets. These
appeals were dismissed by a ruling of September 4, 2019.

A decision from the IBPT on the new monthly rates for wholesale
access to the cable networks should be forthcoming in early 2020.
Regarding wholesale fiber prices, based on “cost plus”, as well as
one-time rates such as activation and installation rates (for both fiber
and cable), public consultations are planned for 2020.

= in market 3a, by excluding unbundling of the local sub-loop, while
maintaining unbundling in the local copper loop, and by limiting the
regulatory obligations of NGA offers to the economic replicability
test and to a technical equivalence of inputs;

in market 3b, by imposing a replicability test of 2P offers and
multicast IPTV wholesale access offers, instead of regulated prices;

= in market 4, by eliminating the sector-based regulatory obligations,
because of the competitive nature of the market.

The RU published rate caps for access to fixed physical infrastructure

legislative measures called the “banking package”, aimed at reducing
risks in the EU banking sector to make it even more resilient to hits
in times of crisis by amending four major banking industry texts:
Regulation (EU) 2019/876 (known as “CRR II”), Directive (EU)
2019/878 (known as “CRD IV”), Directive (EU) 201 9/879 (known as
“BRRD II”), and Regulation (EU) 806/2014 (known as “SRMR’);

these changes affect a large number of areas such as capital and
liquidity, market and interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and
“major exposures”, and they also toughen communication requirements.
They also introduce a principle of proportionality, making it easier for
small banks to comply with regulatory standards (especially for
reporting). The new regulations will take effect over a period ranging
from 18 to 24 months;

= following the European Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)
2018/33 of September 28, 2017, the format and content of the
annual statement of bank charges will be tightly regulated and
standardized as of January 1, 2020 (statement covering transactions
in 2019);

of September 28, 2017 concerns the standardized layout rules for
the Tariff Information Document (TID). In accordance with the Order
of September 5, 2018, this new pricing document, coming in
addition to pricing conditions, was made available to customers on
July 31, 2019;

adopted definitively on April 11, 2019, the PACTE Act (Action Plan
or Business Growth and Transformation) transposed into French
law the provisions of European Directive 2017-2399, which defines
he rank of seniority of unsecured debt instruments in the event of
insolvency. This seniority already existed in France since Law
2016-1691, but its scope has now been extended to investment
irms, financial institutions and financial holding companies;

more generally, the PACTE Act introduced a series of measures in
banking and financial law, including changes to the operating rules
‘or share savings plans (PEAs), a broadening of the AMF’s remit,
and the repeal of the rules on the domiciliation of income in a context
of real-estate loans;

inally, the PACTE Act established a clear legislative framework for

2.1 Risk factors

In addition to the information contained in this Universal Registration
Document, investors should also carefully consider the risks outlined
below before deciding whether to invest. Orange s view as of the date
of this Universal Registration Document is that these risks could have
a material negative effect (i) on its business, financial position, profits,
reputation or outlook or (ii) on its stakeholders. In addition, other risks
and uncertainties, as yet unidentified or, as of the date of this Universal
Registration Document, not currently considered to be material by
Orange, could have similar negative effects. Investors could lose all or
part of their investment if these risks materialize.

In assessing the significance of these risks, the results of mitigation
policies implemented by Orange are taken into account. Only the risks
still deemed significant at Group level despite these policies are set
out below.

The risks are presented in this section under four categories:
—for Orange:

— operational risks relating to Oranges business activities (see
Section 2.1.1),

— risks of a legal nature (see Section 2.1.2),
— financial risks (see Section 2.1.3);

—and for Orange and its stakeholders: the main non -financial risks
relating to the corporate, social and environmental consequences
of Orange s activities, and to the effects of these activities in terms
of respect for human rights, anti-corruption measures and tax
avoidance (see Section 2.1.4).

These categories are not presented in order of importance. However,
within each category, risk factors are presented in descending order
of importance, as determined by Orange at the date of filing this
Universal Registration Document. Orange may change its view of their
relative importance at any time, particularly if new external or internal
facts come to light.

Several other sections of this Universal Registration Document also
discuss risks in some detail:

2.1.1 Operational risks

Operational risks mainly include risks related to the telecommunications
sector, and risks related to Oranges strategy and business. Risks with
potentially substantial employee, environmental and social consequences
are presented in Section 2.1.4.

A significant portion of Oranges revenues is

High

generated in highly competitive markets where
pricing pressure is strong and regulatory decisions
are a determining factor.

In France and Spain particularly, Orange is still experiencing extremely
strong competition which mainly affects prices. In parallel, the operation
of markets is subject to the decisions of industry regulators and
competition authorities. In this context, Orange is continuing to
implement a policy of moving towards a multi -services operator model
by offering convergent offers (very high -speed fixed and mobile
broadband) with a more generous data allowance while improving the
quality of its services. Should Orange fail to implement its strategy it
may lose a portion of its market share and see its margins reduced.

For further information about competition, see Section 1.4

In addition, the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as assessed
at the date of publication of this document, are mentioned in section
3.2.1 Recentevents .The consequences of the outbreak are uncertain;
it could have an impact on the Group s business and financial situation
and may exacerbate the risks described below.

High concentration among Oranges critical

High

suppliers creates a risk for the Group s business.

Oranges critical suppliers, in particular in the network infrastructure,
IT systems and mobile handset sectors, operate in highly concentrated
markets. Despite secure supply policies implemented by Orange, this
concentration poses a risk to the Groups current or future business
(for example the supply of hardware for 5G networks) in the event that
one of these suppliers defaults or decides to change its business
practices, regardless of the causes, including the introduction of
international economic sanctions against these critical suppliers or
their country of origin. In addition, any significant change in critical
suppliers may affect the terms of their partnership with Orange. If any
of these situations were to arise, they could have a lasting effect on
Orange s business, profits and corporate image.
Oranges large geographic footprint and the

High

scope of its activities exposes it to geopolitical,
macroeconomic and regulatory risks.

In emerging countries where the Group is present, its contribution to
the local economy is often significant while its corporate image is
sometimes connected to that of the French state. In this context,
political instability or changes in the economic, regulatory, fiscal or
social situation in these regions exposes Orange to the decisions of
governmental or legal authorities that are contrary to its interests, such
as new taxes or fines which, if contested, may lead the authorities to
decide to suspend services. International economic sanctions imposed
on certain countries could also affect the value or permanence of the
investments made in those countries. Such situations could call into
question profit forecasts made at the time of investment decisions and
affect the Group s financial position and earnings.

Orange is faced with increasing demand for
connectivity and must therefore accelerate the
deployment of networks while improving the
quality of service, but such investments are
constrained by the availability of resources.

Orange must accelerate the deployment of its fixed and mobile
broadband and very high -speed broadband networks in the regions
and improve their quality of service, to meet the needs for increased
connectivity and anticipating the arrival of SG. Orange has also made
service -level and geographical coverage commitments to public and
local authorities in France. However, Oranges investment capacity is
constrained by its human, industrial and financial resources, as well
as those of its subcontractors. Failing to meet these expectations in

a balanced way could have an effect on Oranges earnings and

reputation.
Medium

The development of mobile financial services

exposes Orange to risks inherent to this sector.

Mobile financial services, including banking services expose Orange
torisks inherent to this sector, such as money laundering, the financing

of terrorism and non -compliance with economic sanction programs,
as well as particularly sensitive and common risks in the financial
services sectors such as fraud, cyber _-attacks or service interruptions.
If these risks materialized, they could have a material effect on the
Group s financial position, the success of its strategy and its reputation.

Orange is exposed to risks of disclosure or ,
Medium

inappropriate modification of stakeholder data
in its possession, in particular as a result of
cyber -attacks.

Orange s activities expose it to risks of losses, disclosure, unauthorized
communication to third parties or inappropriate modification of data
stored on its infrastructure or carried by its networks, belonging to
business customers or government authorities, suppliers or partners,
or any other stakeholders other than individuals (see Section 2.1.4 for
personal data).

These risks may materialize (i) from the implementation of new services
or applications, (ii) from the development of new activities in the field

of connected devices, (iii) from malicious acts (suchas cyber —_-attacks)

particularly aimed at data in Oranges possession, or (iv) possible
negligence or errors within Orange or the Group s outsourcing partners.

The Group could be held liable if these risks were to materialize.
Moreover, while the Groups stakeholders have high expectations in
terms of security, given Oranges position as a trusted operator, its
reputation may be strongly affected, which would materially affect its
future earnings.

Risk factors and activity management framework

Risk factors

Orange is exposed to the risk of an interruption
of its services.

Medium

Telecommunications network operators are

particularly exposed to deliberate, sometimes criminal acts, owing to
the essential nature of telecommunications. Services supplied to
customers could thus be interrupted as a result of cyber
malicious activities (such as sabotage of critical software) or requests
issued by governments or legal authorities.

Interruptions may also be involuntary. They may occur as a result of
extreme climate events, human error such as outages during work on

shared infrastructure by sub  -contractors, failure of a critical supplier,

or insufficient network capacity to meet the growing usage needs, or
during the commissioning of new applications or software.

Despite business continuity and crisis management measures taken
by Orange to protect its networks, the high frequency of cyber
the streamlining of the network through the use of all-IP technologies,
the increasing size of service platforms and the relocation of equipment
into fewer buildings mean that, in the future, service interruptions may
affect a greater number of customers and more than one country
simultaneously. Such events could seriously damage Oranges
reputation, trigger its liability and result in a reduction of traffic and its
revenue, affecting its earnings and outlook. If they were to occur on a
nationwide or multinational scale, they might also create a crisis
potentially affecting the security of the countries concerned.

Orange s strategy for developing its new sources
of growth may not give the expected results.

Medium

Oranges strategy is to accelerate its business in

growth areas with a particular focus on mobile financial services
(including Mobile Banking), B2B IT services and cyber security.
Although building on the Groups strengths (digital expertise,
distribution strength, capacity for innovation, brand image and a strong
presence in the MEA Region), the development of these new
businesses requires substantial resources, without any guarantee that
the corresponding services will gain sufficient traction to generate a
return on these investments. Should Orange fail to implement its
strategy it may lose a portion of its market share and see its margins
reduced.

The shift of Orange s ecosystem towards a more
open and fragmented model enables global

Medium

players to have a greater stake in the value chain
of services and networks.

Competition with Over-The-Top (OTT) service providers and Internet
giants in the provision of value -added services using the networks is
spreading to individual access services made possible by technological
changes and the growing number of connected objects. This
development could accelerate with the launch of 5G and the position
of operators such as Orange, for which the direct relationship with
customers adds value, may be weakened.

Risk factors and activity management framework
Risk factors

Moreover, the opening up and fragmentation of the network
ecosystems enables existing players (infrastructure managers,
non -telecoms networked businesses such as railways, local authorities
or Cloud service providers) to offer network services and new players
(SD-WAN etc. ) to position themselves as aggregators of such services,
a role traditionally filled by integrated operators such as Orange.

These two developments could affect Orange s revenues and outlook.

The Groups brand policy, combined with a eT

strategy of geographic expansion and
diversification into new businesses, represents
an image risk for the Orange brand.

The strategy implemented by Orange to accelerate its activities in
growth areas implies operational implementation risks inherent to the
new business lines (particularly mobile banking and cyber defense)
and the countries into which the Group is expanding. Although the
Group pays close attention to preserving the value of the Orange
brand, which constitutes a major asset, if these risks were to materialize,
they could adversely affect the company s reputation, in particular in
the mature mobile telephony sector. In the event of material damage
to the Orange brand, the Groups profits and outlook may be affected.

The scope of Oranges business and the
interconnection of the networks mean that

Low

Orange is exposed to a variety of acts of technical
fraud, specific to the telecommunications and
mobile financial services sectors.

Orange faces risks of different types of fraud relating to its
telecommunications or mobile financial services, which may affect it
directly, or affect its customers. In a context of increasingly complex

2.1.2 Legal risks

Orange operates in highly regulated markets and

. . Loe High
its business activities and results could be

materially affected by legislative or regulatory
changes, including those with extraterritorial
scope, or by changes in government policy.

In most countries in which it operates, Orange has little flexibility to
manage its business activities as it must comply with various
increasingly restrictive regulatory obligations governing the provision
of its products and services, primarily relating to obtaining and renewing
licenses to operate its activities. Orange must also comply with
regulatory obligations and the oversight by authorities seeking to
maintain effective market competition, as well as, in some countries,
additional constraints owing to its historically dominant position in the
fixed telecommunications market.

Oranges business activities and profits may be materially adversely
affected by legislative or regulatory changes, sometimes of an
extraterritorial nature, or by changes to government policy, and in
particular by decisions taken by regulatory or competition authorities
in connection with:

—the amendment or renewal under unfavorable conditions, or even
withdrawal, of fixed -line or mobile operator licenses;

—conditions governing network access (primarily those in connection
with roaming or infrastructure sharing);

— service rates;

—the introduction of new taxes or increases in existing taxes on
telecommunications companies, including the introduction of taxes
aimed at facilitating the achievement of countries carbon neutrality
targets (such as taxes on use or handset purchases);

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

technologies, network virtualization and faster implementation of new
services or applications, types of fraud that are more difficult to detect
or control may also appear, encouraged by the development of mass
data processing, which increases the scope for possible attacks,
particularly cyber-attacks. Should a serious case of fraud occur,
Oranges revenues, margins, quality of service and reputation could
be affected.

Orange s technical infrastructure is vulnerable to
damage caused by intentional or accidental

Low

damage, or natural disasters whose increasing
frequency is caused by climate change.

A natural disaster, intentional damage in the course of wars, terrorist
acts, social unrest, or other accidental events such as fires or civil
engineering on infrastructure, may cause significant damage to
Oranges installations, potentially giving rise to service interruptions
and generating high repair costs. The frequency and intensity of
weather events related to climate change (floods, storms, heat waves)
are increasing, which could aggravate accidents and increase related
damage. In the medium term, rising sea levels could affect sites and
facilities near the coast more often. Whilst insurance cover for claims
could fall further, damage caused by major disasters may result in
significant costs to Orange and could thus seriously affect its financial
position and outlook.

—regulation of banking and financial activities and any similar
regulations requiring compliance such as laws and rules on
economic sanctions;

—regulations governing data security;

—merger policy;

—regulations affecting operators of competing sectors, such as cable;
—consumerism legislation.

Such decisions could materially affect the Group s revenue and results.

For further information on risks related to regulations, see Section 1.7
Regulation of activities .

Orange is continually involved in litigation, the
outcome of which could have a material adverse

Medium

effect on its profits, financial position or reputation.

Orange believes that, on a general basis and in all countries in which
it is present, it complies with all the specific regulations in force, as
well as the conditions governing its operator licenses. However, the
company is not able to predict the decisions of oversight and legal
authorities who are regularly asked to rule on such issues. Should
Orange be ordered by the relevant authorities in a country in which it
operates, to pay damages or a fine or suspend some of its activities
due to non -compliance with an applicable regulation, the Groups
financial position and results could be adversely affected.

In addition, Orange — particularly in France and Poland — is frequently
involved in legal proceedings with its competitors and with the
regulatory authorities due to its dominant position in certain markets,
and the claims made against Orange may be substantial. In the past,

the Group has been fined several tens of millions of euros and even
several hundreds of millions of euros for concerted practices or for
abuse of a dominant position. The Group is also involved in substantial
litigations with potentially very significant penalties. The outcome of
lawsuits is inherently unpredictable.

In the case of proceedings involving European Competition Authorities,
the maximum fine provided for by law is 10% of the consolidated
revenue of the company at fault (or the Group to which it belongs, as
the case may be).

2.1.3 Financial risks

Liquidity risk

Orange s results and outlook could be affected
if the terms of access to the capital markets

Medium

become difficult.

Orange finances itself mainly through the bond markets. An unfavorable
development in the macroeconomic context could restrict or make

significantly more expensive Oranges access to its usual sources of

financing through an increase in market rates and/or the margins

applied to its borrowings.

Any inability to access the financial markets for a lasting period and /
or obtain financing on reasonable terms might have a material adverse
effect on Orange. The Group could, in particular, be required to allocate
a significant portion of its available cash to service or pay off debt, to
the detriment of investment or shareholders remuneration. In all cases,
Orange s results, cash flows and, more generally, financial position and
flexibility may be adversely affected.

See Note 13.3 Liquidity risk management to the consolidated financial
statements, which sets out different financing sources available to
Orange, the maturity of its debt and changes to its credit rating, as
well as Note 13.4 Financial ratios , which contains information on the
limited commitments of the Orange Group in relation to financial ratios
and in the event of default or material adverse change.

Risk of asset impairment

Changes affecting the economic, political or
regulatory environment may result in asset

Medium

impairment, particularly of goodwill.

At December 31, 2019, the gross value of goodwill recognized by
Orange following completed acquisitions and disposals was
! 33.6 billion, not including the goodwill of associates and joint ventures.

The book values of long -term assets, including goodwill and fixed
assets, are sensitive to any change in the business environment that
is different from the assumptions used. Orange recognizes assets as

Risk factors and activity management framework
Risk factors

Finally, owing in particular to its use of a large number of
sub -contractors, and the presence of rare minerals in the products it
distributes, Orange is exposed to a growing risk of legal action by
various civil society stakeholders who may accuse it of various
environmental, employee -related or social breaches. Such actions
could cause significant harm to Oranges reputation.

The main proceedings involving Orange are detailedin Note 10 ‘Taxes
and Note 17 Litigation to the consolidated financial statements.
Developments in or the results of some or all of the ongoing proceedings
could have a material adverse effect on Oranges results or financial
position.

impaired if events or circumstances occur that involve material adverse
changes of a permanent nature affecting the economic environment
or the assumptions and targets used at the time of the acquisition.

Over the past five years, Orange recognized significant impairment
losses in respect of its interests in Poland, Congo (DRC), Cameroon,
Egypt and Jordan. At December 31, 2019, the cumulative amount of
goodwill impairment was ! 5.9 billion, not including the goodwill
impairment of associates and joint ventures.

New events or adverse circumstances could conduct Orange to review
the present value of its assets and to recognize further substantial
impairment that could have an adverse effect on its results.

In addition, in the case of disposals or listings on a stock exchange,
the value of certain subsidiaries could be affected by changes in the
stock and debt markets.

For further information on goodwill and recoverable amounts
(particularly key assumptions and sensitivity), see Note 7 Impairment
losses and goodwill and Note 8.2 Impairment of fixed assets to the

consolidated financial statements and Section 3.1.2.2 Group operating
income.

Credit -rating risks

Achange in the outlook for Orange s credit rating eT

could increase its borrowing costs and, in certain

circumstances, Orange s access to the capital
it needs could be limited.

Oranges credit rating from rating agencies is partly based on factors
over which it has no control, namely conditions affecting the
telecommunications industry in general or conditions affecting certain
countries or regions in which it operates. It may be changed at any
time by the rating agencies, in particular as a result of changing
economic conditions, a downturn in the Group s results or performance

or changes to its investor base. A prolonged multi — -notch downgrade
in Orange s rating would have a material adverse effect on its financing
terms.

2.1.4 Non -financial risks

The various non -financial risks, included in the scope of Oranges
Statement of Non-Financial Performance (SNFP) have been identified
and assessed, and are managed using the same methodology used

for operational risks related to its business, legal risks and financial
risks.

As part of its SNFP, Orange presents the material employee -related,
environmental and social risks to which its business may give rise,
whether to itself or its stakeholders, as well as corruption risks and
matters relating to combating tax avoidance and to business ethics.
These were assessed in line with the salience matrix related to
non-financial issues (see Section 2.2.4).

Combating tax avoidance, food waste and food insecurity, respect for
animal well-being and responsible food practices, were all taken into
account as part of Oranges non _ -financial risk assessment. However,
they were not considered likely to give rise to risks to the Groups
operations or reputation.

In particular in the event of acyber-attack, Orange

. . . . . High
is exposed to risks of disclosure or inappropriate

modification of personal data, in particular
customer data. These risks have increased due
to the Group’ s diversification into mobile financial
services.

With regard to the risk of breaching human rights and fundamental
freedoms, Oranges business activities expose it to risks of loss,
disclosure, unauthorized communication to third parties or inappropriate
modification of the personal data of its customers, employees or the
general public which are stored on its infrastructures or carried by its
networks. This includes their bank details in particular, which are,
moreover, the basis of Oranges mobile financial services business.

These risks may notably materialize from (i) the implementation of new
services or applications, (ii) the development of new activities in the
field of connected devices or mobile services, (iii) malicious acts (such
as cyber -attacks) particularly targeting personal data (iv) possible
negligence or errors within Orange or the Group s outsourcing partners
or (v) government requests without any respect for legal or regulatory
formalities (see below for more information on this last point).

Orange may be held liable in various countries under laws that are
being increasingly tightened (such as the General Data Protection
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, or GDPR) and that
strengthen individual rights and obligations on data processors such
as operators and providers of financial services.

Should these risks materialize, owners of the disclosed or modified
data may incur considerable losses, the Group s liability may be invoked
and its reputation and image substantially affected.

Orange is exposed to risks of corruption
8 P P ° Medium

behavior by individuals or groups that does not
comply with its business ethics, or fraudulent
behavior.

Through its activities, as well as those of its suppliers, subcontractors
and partners, throughout the world, and despite its efforts to reinforce
its anti-corruption policy in compliance with current laws, Orange may
be exposed to or implicated in matters relating to corrupt practices,
or may fall victim to behavior that is fraudulent or does not comply with
international conventions, its Code of Ethics, or its Supplier Code of
Conduct, by persons or businesses with which direct or indirect ties
may be established. These behaviors may target Orange directly, its
customers, its business relations or its employees.

In any event, the Groups liability may be invoked, and Oranges
revenues, margins, quality of service and reputation could be affected.

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

Orange faces a variety of internal and external
risks relating to human health and safety.

Medium

Owing to the specific nature of its operator business

and its geographical location, and in a context where tensions and
social unrest is increasing, employees of Orange and its subcontractors
are exposed to risks to their safety. In addition, the strategic plan,
Engage 2025, aims to establish the conditions for a lasting, responsible
transformation to ensure the social and human coherence of the
Groups projects worldwide. Nevertheless, this could cause
psychosocial risks which may be a source of physical or psychological
incapacity for individuals. These risks could also slow the roll-out of
the Group s strategy and have a material impact on the Group s image
and operations.

The scope of Oranges business activities, its
numerous locations around the world, and its
business dealings witha variety of partners may
expose the Group to a risk of breaching human
rights and fundamental freedoms.

Through its activities, as well as those of its suppliers and
subcontractors throughout the world, Orange may be exposed to
breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms (such as forced
labor, infringement of the rights of children, indecent, discriminatory
or dangerous working conditions, obstruction of freedoms of
association or expression, or invasion of privacy), involving third parties
with whom a direct or indirect link may be established. This is the case
in certain regions where minerals are mined, processed and traded in
conflict zones or areas where human rights are not respected.

Should these risks materialize, they may have a significant effect on
the image and reputation of Orange or the suppliers and subcontractors
in question, and may result in their liability being invoked.

Moreover, Orange may be required, in the countries where it operates,
to comply with injunctions from local authorities that do not comply
with formal legal or regulatory requirements. These injunctions, the
frequency of which is increasing with the growing role played by digital
technologies in society, may involve a suspension (in full, in part, or in
a given region) of certain networks for which Orange is responsible,
or the interception of communications, or the disclosure of personal
data to third parties. Complying with such injunctions may therefore
undermine freedom of expression or fundamental freedoms.

Should Orange fail to ensure compliance with applicable legislation or
regulations, these injunctions may significantly impact the image or
reputation of Orange or of the countries concerned. For civil society
or the targets of these requests, they may also involve breaching
freedom of expression and respect for privacy.

Orange and some of its stakeholders are
exposed to physical and transitional risks related
to climate change.

Medium

Other than the effects on Orange infrastructure (see Section 2.1.1
Orange s infrastructure is vulnerable to damage caused by intentional
or accidental damage or by natural disasters the increasing frequency
of which is caused by climate change) , climate change may have
negative effects on its activities and those of its suppliers or
subcontractors. It is also creating expectations among Orange
customers, particularly in respect of its capacity to set up emergency
services in the case of an extreme climate event. Climate change could
also result in an increase in inequalities and health crises among
populations and in significant displacement of populations within the
MEA Region on which the Groups prospects for growth in part
depend. Should such events materialize, Orange may experience
greater difficulties in fulfilling its purpose.
In the future, Orange may find it difficult to obtain ,

and retain the skills needed for its business due

to numerous employee departures and ever
faster changes in its activities.

The high number of retirements and employees working part __-time at
the end of their careers in France as well as the new skills required in
relation to the development of new technologies and the Groups
development priorities in high -demand segments of the employment
market, may affect Orange s capacity to continue its business activities
efficiently and successfully implement its strategy. Should Orange s
efforts to attract staff or its ambitious training policy prove insufficient,
its profits and outlook may be affected and some of the human risks
described below may increase. Moreover, the success of Oranges
digital support for some of its stakeholders may be compromised.

Exposure to electromagnetic fields of telecommu - a

nications equipment, as well as the excessive or

inappropriate use of telecommunication services
and equipment may be potentially harmful to
people s health.

Following concerns raised in many countries regarding the possible
health risks linked to exposure to electromagnetic fields from
telecommunications equipment, public authorities have in general
approved binding regulations and health authorities have issued various
usage precautions.

The perception by the public of a risk for human health or biodiversity
could lead to a decrease in the number of customers and in their
usage, an increase in lawsuits, particularly against the installation of
mobile antennas, difficulties in opening new sites, thus jeopardizing
among others the deployment of 5G networks, and the tightening of
regulations, with, as a consequence, a reduction in coverage,
deterioration of service quality and an increase in network roll -out
costs.

Consensus exists among health experts and health authorities,
including the World Health Organization (WHO), that, so far, no health
risks from exposure to electromagnetic fields below the limits
recommended by the specialist international commission (ICNIRP)
have been identified. Nevertheless, further scientific studies must be
conducted on certain frequencies used for 5G (millimeter waves).

Risk factors and activity management framework
Risk factors

Orange cannot predict the findings of future scientific research or
future studies by international organization and scientific committees
called upon to examine these issues. If an adverse health effect should
one day be scientifically established, this would have a significant
effect on Oranges business, its brand image and the income and
financial position of the Group. Beyond potential effects on Orange,
this could significantly curb the development of the digital society.

Similarly, the widespread availability of connected digital devices may
give rise to excessive use, which could have negative physical and
psychological consequences for users, particularly young adults and
children. It also increases the risk of exposure to inappropriate content,
cyber bullying and misinformation, as well as the risk of information
overload.

Should this widespread availability be perceived as a risk for the most
vulnerable populations, it may also result for Orange in a decrease in
the use of its services and damage to its reputation. Socially, the
perception of this risk may result in mistrust of digital tools and may
curb innovation.

In any event, the Groups liability may be invoked, and Oranges
revenues, margins, quality of service and reputation could be affected.

The rapid development of new uses and
technologies may jeopardize the commitments

Low

made by Orange with regard to reducing its effect
on the environment.

Due to the nature of its services and its social reach, Orange must
offer new solutions to reduce the environmental impact of its customers,
while limiting its own sources of environmental pollution. Orange has
committed to being Net Zero carbon by 2040 and has set the interim
target of a 30% reduction initsCO _, emissions by 2025 compared with
2015. Under its strategic plan, Engage 2025, Orange plans to improve
the management of its energy consumption, implementation of the
principles of the circular economy, use of renewable energy and
investments in carbon sinks. Should its environmental action plans
prove insufficient or depend on resources that are unavailable,
particularly during the technological transition period for the fixed
network and the introduction of mobile 5G, Orange may not be in a
position to uphold its commitments, which would materially adversely
affect its image.

2.2

The risk management and internal control system consists of an
organizational structure, procedures and control systems implemented

by Senior Management and all employees under the responsibility of

the Board of Directors. It is designed to provide reasonable assurance

that operating targets are met, that current laws and regulations are
complied with, and that the financial and non —-financial information is
reliable.

The measures introduced are a response in particular to Oranges
obligations under certain laws such as the American Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the Financial Security Law of France of July 17, 2003, Order
2008 -1278 of December 8, 2008, transposing Directive 2006/43/EC

of May 17, 2006, on statutory audits, Order of March 17, 2016,
transposing Directive 2014/56/EU, and Law No. 2016 -1691 of
December 9, 2016, on transparency, combating corruption and the
modernization of the economy, the so-called Sapin Il Law No.
2017 -399 of March 27, 2017, on the duty of care of parent companies

and main contractor companies, which requires the implementation

of a vigilance plan, and Directive No. 2014/95/EU of October 22, 2014,
known as the Barnier Directive, which was transposed into French law

by Decree No. 2017 -1265 of August 9, 2017.

These measures are being rolled out across all Group entities as part
of a process of continuous improvement. Within the framework of the

2.2.1

The Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department (DACRG)
reports to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Finance,
Performance and Europe. It gathers within a single body the following

functions: Internal Audit, Risk Management, General Control, Credit
Management, Internal Control, Fraud, and Revenue Assurance.

Its role is to define, deploy, manage and assess the Groups risk
management and activities control system on behalf of Senior
Management with a view to providing integrated assurance offering
the best balance between risks and opportunities, working closely
with operational departments and addressing their concerns,
capitalizing on a team of experts and co -designing innovative
approaches, in cooperation with the other teams responsible for Group

risk management, while preserving audit independence.

At the heart of the Groups challenges and strategy, through this
integrated assurance the DACRG supports changes in the Groups
activities. To this end, its role is to preserve revenue (revenue assurance
and customer risk management), manage fraud, (prevention, detection
and management) support the second line of defense departments
as well as to strengthen governance, while offering solutions to improve
risk management and create value.

Internal Control and Risk Management s continuous improvement
process can, for example, materialize in:

—updates of the fraud prevention processes, the modules of which
are distributed and evaluated on a regular basis;

—risk management training for Directors and Chief Executive Officers
of subsidiaries;

—the focus of audit work on the Groups major risks;

—and by publishing the policies and practices defined and identified
in the Orange Internal Control Book (see sectionon —_ Internal Control
below), which cover the main activities and may be supported by

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

Activity and risk management framework

Group s policies, it mobilizes the stakeholders of the second line of
defense. It is led by both the Groups Audit, Control and Risk
Management Department, and the Groups Corporate Social
Responsibility Department. The Groups departments in charge of
security, data protection, compliance, human resources, procurement,
insurance and legal are also involved in this system and support the
operational departments. The risk management and internal control
system is supported by the Executive Committee, as well as the Risks
Committee and other governance committees (see Section 5.2.2.3
Executive Committee and Group governance committees)

Furthermore, the Group s General Inspection Department investigates
any Group entity, exclusively at the request of the Chairman, to whom
it reports directly. It is informed about the work of General Control and
Internal Audit and may request their input. The Groups Inspector
General sits on the Risks Committee, the Ethics Committee and the
Investment Committee.

Finally, in accordance with the provisions of Directives 2006/43/EC
and 2014/56/EU, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is
tasked with ensuring efficiency of the internal control and financial risk
management systems particularly, in addition to reviewing exposure
to social and environmental risks, in accordance with the latest
amendments to the revised Afep-Medef Code of June 2018.

Group Audit, Control and Risk Management

a self-assessment process, in order to enable entities to compare
themselves against the levels of control and practices expected by
the Group.

The DACRG coordinates internal control reviews with the Executive
Committee members, in collaboration with the internal control functions
of the organization s divisions. They are designed to provide assurance
that the internal control system is effective, namely that the main risks
have been identified and the appropriate steps taken to limit their
potential effect. Internal control reviews are part of the integrated
assurance approach between operational functions and functions in
charge of risk management.

Within the context of the Essentials2020_ strategic plan, the DACRG
and the ACR (Audit, Control and Risks) community, which brings
together those within the Group working on these functions, have
grown stronger so as to drive international business growth as well as
diversification, particularly into mobile financial services.

Indeed, acharter has been signed by the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. This sets out the remit of the ACR Community, which reports
to the DACRG, and the integrated assurance process (synergies
among the local and central Audit, Control, and Risk functions, and
with operational departments) is thus strengthened to meet the
company s targets.

Finally, the DACRGs activities are in line with best practices promoted
by the Institut fran ais de | Audit et du Contr le Interne (IFACI) and the
Association pour le Management des Risques et des Assurances de

1 Entreprise (AMRAE).

ISO 9001 Quality Certification for DACRG

In July 2019, the AFAQ/AFNOR follow-up audit confirmed the DACRG
ISO 9001 certification (renewed in July 2018). This quality approach
which supports DACRG s aim of becoming a trusted business partner
contributes to the improvement and simplification of all processes in
order to adopt best practices that meet the requirements of Orange s
stakeholders.

This Certification covers activities related to the definition, deployment,
management and evaluation of the Group s policy, implemented by

DACRG, on internal control and risk management as well as those

related to the management of the Group Audit, Control and Risk

community .

Group Internal Audit

Group Internal Audit has around 70 qualified auditors working as a
shared service for all Group entities. They are for the most part located
in France. Group Internal Audit comprises teams dedicated to the IT
system, the networks and financial services. It cooperates with the
local audit teams, in accordance with their governance rules: sharing
of audit plans, follow-up of recommendations, joint audits,
methodological exchanges. This mainly involves operator subsidiaries
that are not 100% controlled (in Europe in particular Orange Polska
and Orange Belgium, and in Africa in particular the Sonatel Group).
Group Internal Audit and Orange Polskas Internal Audit are certified
on an annual basis by IFACI Certification, based on the professional
guidelines for internal audits (RPAI in French). In turn, in 2019, the
Sonatel Group s internal audit function was certified by IFACI.

Issues may be referred directly to Group Internal Audit by the Chairman

of the Audit Committee or by the Chairman and CEO. The Director of
Group Audit is authorized to directly inform the Executive Committee
and the Audit Committee.

Each year, the audit plan is endorsed by the Risk Committee and
approved by the Audit Committee. An annual report, with the main
results and findings, is also presented to the Risk Committee and then
the Audit Committee.

The joint operation with Deutsche Telekom (BuylIn) is subject to audits
conducted jointly by the Orange Groups and Deutsche Telekoms
Internal Audit Departments.

By means of its audit assignments, Internal Audit helps the Group to
maintain an appropriate management control system by assessing its
effectiveness and efficiency and by formulating remarks and
recommendations for its ongoing improvement. The recommendations
arising from internal audit assignments are systematically monitored
and lead in particular to action plans that are drawn up and implemented
by the Group s divisions and subsidiaries. These assignments include,
among others, checks performed at the request of the Group s Internal
Control Department as part of the systematic assessment of internal
financial control, particularly tests of the operating effectiveness of the
internal control system and cyclical audits performed on the internal
control system of smaller subsidiaries. Internal Audit also contributes
to the approach of risk identification, assessment and processing
through the results of its audit assignments and its recommendations.

Risk Management

The Groups Risk Management Department defines the strategy and
deploys the Group s risk management approach, within the framework
of the integrated approach promoted by the ACR charter. To this end:

—it leads the risk identification and assessment processes on behalf
of the Risk Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3. Executive Committee
and Group governance committees)  ;

——it ensures the relevant action plans are monitored, with support from
Group internal control and networks of risk managers and internal
controllers of the entities and subsidiaries;

—it supports all Group entities in carrying out risk maps of all kinds,
including the Group s Corporate Social Responsibility Department
for non-financial risks;

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

—it anticipates the risks linked with the strategic plan, including those
relating to new growth activities, in cooperation with the Groups
Strategy Department.

Each risk is defined as a potential event, the consequences of which,
should these risks materialize, would prevent Orange or one of its
entities from carrying out its assignments, fulfilling its commitments or
achieving its objectives, or could affect Orange s employees, assets,
profits and financial position, the environment, or the Group or entity s
reputation. The various sources of risk identification are a combination
of the views of Directors and Officers of the operating entities. The
analysis of causes and consequences complements and refines the
description of the event and influences the risk probability level or risk
impact level. The context analysis makes it possible to characterize
the risk in each particular situation, to fine- tune its causes and
consequences, and to assess the probability and impacts of the risk

in a way that is suited to the area of the organization where the risk is
identified. Their inclusion in risk mapping reflects the principle of the
prevalence inimpactanalysis (consequence _ -related) onthe probability
analysis (cause -related).

The Groups management teams identify and assess, at least once a
year, the risks falling within their remit. This mapping forms the
cornerstone on which the control systems are built. It also contains a
description of additional action plans aimed at stepping up the internal
control required to address these risks.

The list of significant events, the changes to risk mapping and the
monitoring of action plans are scrutinized during internal control reviews
of each department.

At Group level, risks are monitored by the Risk Committee. The overall
Risk Management Report is reviewed at least once a year by this Risk
Committee and presented to the directors at a joint meeting of the
Board of Directors committees, during which major risks are discussed
in the presence of the directors concerned. This approach includes a
review of all of the risks described in Section 2.1
document.

General Control

General Control involves, at the request of Executive Committee
members or their respective management committees, or following a
report from the ethics whistleblowing mechanism, investigations on
matters involving employees that may run counter to the Groups
interests. These matters may involve instances of fraud, conflicts of
interest, damage to Group assets, behavioral problems and in general
any acts by employees that conflict with Group rules. In this respect,
General Control works in a complementary manner to the various
departments within the DACRG as well as to Group General Inspection.
General Control is represented in France by investigation units and at
Group level for international cases by general controllers. Some
countries such as Poland, Spain, Romania and Senegal have dedicated
internal structures and operate in a network with General Control.

Credit Management

The remit of Group Credit Management is to minimize financial risks
related to the credit given to customers. Its purpose is to have a
consolidated vision of the credit risks with our clients and partners
(quarterly credit committee) and to implement tools that allow these
risks to be managed. In order to do this, it depends on local teams or
contacts and on the processes in place in each operational entity.

It disseminates the culture of Credit Management within the Group
and oversees customer risk management within the Group.

Internal control

Group Internal Control draws up and implements the Internal Control
strategy within the Group. To this end, it defines a methodology, a

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

Risk factors in this

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

process and the necessary tools for its application. It rolls them out
annually, particularly as regards:

—the updating and distribution of a set of policies and practices
defined by the Group in collaboration with the relevant Group
functions and domains, the Orange IC Book ;

—the internal control self -assessment program, on the basis of risk
analysis andthe Orange IC Book ; the aim being to identify the main
improvements to be made in terms of risk coverage and therefore
the internal control and to implement corrective actions as needed.

In addition, if necessary, internal audits can be used to confirm
self-assessment results and ensure the effectiveness of the action
plans implemented.Sarbanes-Oxley certification process for financial
internal control.

Group Internal Control coordinates the local internal control functions
and the persons in charge of the control environment domains, giving
them support and advice to ensure the quality and the control of their
system. The role of the local internal control function is to assist the
operating managers of their entities, in order to help them structure
and maintain an efficient internal control system, which meets both
their own and the Group s requirements. To do this, they apply the risk
and activity management directives issued by the Group, and ensure
the smooth running of the system at their own level.

Group Internal Control agrees to an annual action and evaluation
program for each scope (domains, divisions, and entities), which is
then rolled out locally. It supports the departments with internal control
assignments designed to provide reasonable assurance that activities
are properly controlled in a number of areas (e.g. compliance with laws
and regulations, governance, operational or decision
processes, integration of new entities, etc. _).

Among its recurring actions, it provides monitoring for governance
committee heads (see Section 5.2.2.3 Group Executive Committee
and governance committees) and coordinates the organization of
internal control reviews for Executive Committee members, with the
support of the DACRG, the Group Security Department, and Group
Compliance.

Working with the Mobile Finance Division, the internal control
departments at the other divisions and entities, Internal Audit and the
Compliance Department, the Group Internal Control Department has
ensured that the Internal Control system is appropriate for controlling
activities and meeting Group regulatory obligations (against money
laundering and the financing of terrorism, and banking obligations).

The internal control evaluation is presented to the Group Risk
Committee and then to the Audit Committee.

Fraud and Revenue Assurance

Revenue recognition in the telecommunications industry is based on
data capture, involving various components of network access —
managing and collecting uses — recovery via the IT systems —
supporting the customer bases and recovery of individual items — and
recording via the accounting and financial systems — supporting the
production of financial statements. The complexity of this technical
and commercial architecture has led Orange, through its Fraud and
Revenue Assurance Department, to develop its own revenue protection

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

-making

strategy; this is underpinned by a methodology ensuring the correct
measurement, substance, comprehensiveness and valuation of the
individual elements underpinning customer invoicing, through a
risk-oriented overview of the entire process chain.

Group Fraud and Revenue Assurance (GFRA) also defines the Group s
strategy and approach to fraud prevention and detection. To support
the deployment of this strategy, GFRA works very closely with their
Internal Control and Risk Management colleagues, along with other
corporate and local entity teams.

Orange has adopted an approach based on anticipation and risk
analysis to manage fraud. GFRA constantly monitors existing and
emerging risks of fraud, as well as any new fraud _ -related legislation.
This enables Orangetoadaptitsanti -fraud strategy accordingly. GFRA
maintains the Groups fraud risk map, which covers all anticipated
risks in this domain (including, for example, fraud in the financial
statements, technical (cyber) fraud, identity theft and social engineering
fraud, missing trader VAT carousels, and combating the financing of
terrorism and money laundering).

Orange has preventative controls in place to reduce the probability of
frauds which may constitute a major risk.

Since prevention cannot be 100% effective, the Group has also defined

a control framework designed to detect instances of fraud. Any cases

or suspicions identified through these controls are investigated and
are processed in compliance with the law and Oranges ethical
standards.

Orange believes that in order to manage fraud risk and to assure
revenue, the cost of fraud and revenue leakage must be managed at

a local level and consolidated at Group level, allowing major incidents
to be analyzed and treated, and any emerging trends identified. With
regard to the production of Group financial information, the approach
defined by GFRA includes such applicable risks as frauds committed
by management or fraud within the financial statements.

Detecting fraud is the responsibility of management, which is assisted
by GFRA and local fraud detection specialists in the Group entities.

A Group whistleblowing mechanism is in place, as provided for under
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the so-called Sapin II Law of December 9,
2016, and the French Law of March 27, 2017, relating to the duty of
care of parent companies and contracting companies. This system is
presented in Section 2.2.4.1.2.

When internal fraud is strongly suspected, investigations are generally
entrusted to specialized services, in particular to General Control.
Investigation services are responsible for establishing the existence of
facts. In the event of internal fraud, company management determines
the penalties. For all cases detected (internal or external fraud), the
civil, criminal, or legal consequences are considered after the
recommendations of the company s Legal Department.

Fraud cases are analyzed by GFRA in order to assess control measures
and therefore better prevent and detect similar fraud cases, in an effort
to ensure continuous improvement.

A summary report on fraud prevention and detection is reviewed at
least once a year by the Group Risk Committee and presented at a
joint meeting to the Board of Directors committees.
2.2.2

The Orange Groups Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities
are coordinated by a dedicated team, reporting to the Senior Executive
Vice-President, Corporate Social Responsibility, Diversity, Partnerships
and Inclusiveness. She regularly reports to Oranges Executive
Committee, through the work of the Ethics Committee, the remit of
which has been extended to include the management of the Groups
sustainable performance and to Oranges Board of Directors through
the work of the Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee
(GCSER). As such, Oranges Executive Committee and Board of
Directors thus familiarize themselves with and take a position on the
main options chosen in relation to the Vigilance Plan, its implementation
report and the relevant aspects of the Statement of Non-Financial
Performance. It also oversees the Groups actions and priorities on
social, societal and environmental matters (including those related to
climate change). The Group CSR Department collaborates with the
Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department. In particular,
itdraws onthe workonnon_ -financial risks presented by other divisions
to Oranges Risk Committee and uses the Groups risk assessment
and management methodology. It also uses the Group s methodology
for rolling out its risk management approach to the entities and takes
part in internal control reviews.

The CSR Department is itself organized by business area (Responsible
Marketing, Corporate & Social Issues, Environment) andcross —_-functional
departments (Communication, Transformation & Operations). It relies
on networks of CSR managers and vigilance plan implementation
managers, coordinated by the Group CSR team, who contribute to

the operational deployment of this approach. For a number of years,
Orange has been using its stakeholder dialog tool to develop the
materiality matrix for issues arising from its activities. In 2019, Orange
has opted to make a formal response to the issues identified in the
commitments made as part of its strategic plan, Engage 2025, and

to set out the Group s societal mission. The mission, jointly developed
with stakeholders is to ensure that digital technology is made available
and used in a more human, inclusive and sustainable way in all areas

of its activity. To this end, Orange has adopted a Purpose as part of

its Bylaws (see Section4 Non-financial performance ,section Orange s
Purpose) . The new strategic plan, Engage 2025, embodies this
Purpose and is itself based on the idea that economic performance

is achieved by leading by example on social and environmental issues.

2.2.3

The specific internal financial control procedures relate to the
preparation and treatment of accounting and financial information,
and the work on internal control carried out pursuant to Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, an insurance policy translates
certain operational risks into financial commitments.

2.2.3.1 Specific internal control procedures
pertaining to the preparation and
processing of accounting and
financial information

The Group Accounting Department and Group Management Control
Department, which both report to the Chief Executive Officer Finance,
Performance and Europe, play a decisive role in the internal control
system.

The Group Accounting and Group Controlling Departments have the
following key duties:

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

Group Corporate Social Responsibility

The Group s commitment is embodied in the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations member states which are:

—investment in infrastructure which is crucial to achieving sustainable
development and the empowerment of communities in many
countries. Oranges core business is to offer its customers
connectivity with ever faster speed and new related services;

—inclusion to reduce inequality. In addition to its ambitions for digital
regional coverage, Orange leads the way on social issues through
its commitment to inclusion by training those affected by digital
exclusion, supporting its customers, promoting access to
responsible service provision to as many people as possible and
supporting digital entrepreneurship. Orange is also striving to use
digital technology to promote equal opportunities;

—combating climate change and its repercussions. For Orange,
leading by example on the environment takes the form of a target
of being Net Zero carbon by 2040, despite a continuous and steady
increase in use across its networks. This involves an unprecedented
effort to achieve energy efficiency for its own emissions as well as
those of its customers and increased use of renewable energy. In
addition to these measures, and without seeking compensation,
the Group will invest in carbon sinks for its residual greenhouse gas
emissions.

Orange implements the principles of inclusion, materiality and
responsiveness as defined in the AA1000 APS (2008), the international
reference for Corporate Social Responsibility that focuses on taking
stakeholders requirements into account. The Group also takes into
account the principles defined by the ISO 26000 standard on Corporate
Social Responsibility, as well as the guidelines set out by the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard, and aligns its publications with the
recommendations of the TCFD (Task ForceonClimate — -related Financial
Disclosures).

To ensure the reliability of indicators and manage the proper
implementation of the Groups commitments in its various business
units, Orange has carried out an external verification of its CSR policy
and achievements by one of its Statutory Auditors for several years,
in order to obtain a reasonable assurance report on selected CSR
information (see Section 4.7 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors)

Specific financial internal control procedures

— producing the Groups consolidated financial statements and the
statutory financial statements for Orange SA and certain French
subsidiaries within time frames that meet financial market
requirements and legal obligations while guaranteeing that the
statements provide a true and fair view of the company in compliance
with the accounting policies adopted by the Group;

—preparing the management reports on the statutory and
consolidated financial statements and producing the necessary
documentation for financial communication of results and the
summary of management reporting for the Executive Committee;

—managing the monthly and quarterly reporting cycle allowing
management to measure the Groups performance on a regular
basis;

— designing and implementing Group methods, procedures and
standards frames for Accounting and Management Controlling;

identifying and carrying out the necessary changes to the Groups
accounting and financial information systems.

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

Within these departments, the internal control of accounting and
financial information is organized around the following elements:

—the Disclosure Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3);
—the Group Accounting and Controlling function;
—unified accounting and management reporting; and

—Group - wide accounting standards and methods.

Unified accounting and management reporting

All of the Group s entities participate in the Group s management and
monitoring cycle, which is composed of three basic components:

—the forecasting process (plan, budget, and periodic internal
provisions);

—the process for producing statutory accounts and the Groups
consolidated financial statements; and

— the management reporting process.

Forecast process (plan, budget, and periodic internal
forecasts)

The Group budgeting process requires regular updates of internal
projections and managements involvement. Itis worked out by country
and division, business unit, and Group subsidiary.

The budget must reflect the Groups ambitions at each level of the
organization. It includes a yearly goal based on year one of the multi-
year plan and forecasts that are updated in May, including an updated
second -half goal, and in October-November to better evaluate target
figures for year-end.

The budget dossier is composed of:

—packages of financial data, along with comments summarizing, in
particular, major actions;

—capital expenditure by nature;
—an analysis of risks and opportunities.

As part of the budget process, the divisions establish and analyze the
performance indicators. The budget is established on a monthly basis
so to be used as a reference for the Groups monthly reporting.

Moreover, the Group draws up a multi-year plan for all countries
and divisions, setting out the medium  -term financial trajectories for
the Group.

Process of preparing the companies statutory financial
statements and the Group s consolidated financial
statements

The financial statements of Orange are prepared in accordance with
the following principles:

— performing a pre -closing of accounts at the end of May and the end
of November;

—anticipating the use of estimates and the treatment of complex
accounting operations;

—and formalizing closing processes and schedules.

As such, documenting the processes leading to the production of
financial information up to the filling of consolidation packages
constitutes a common framework for all contributors, thus
strengthening internal control within the accounting and management
controlling function.

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

Instructions from the Consolidation Department specifying the process
and agreed timeline for each closing are circulated within the Group,
and then broken down by subsidiary.

Consolidation packages are created monthly by each entity of the
Group, according to IFRS accounting policies, and entered in the
Group s consolidation and reporting tool.

The Group s principles, when they are compatible with the local rules
applicable to the statutory financial statements, prevail, in order to limit
subsequent restatements. However, in the event that principles
inconsistent with those of the Group are applied in an entity s statutory
financial statements and have a significant effect on measuring earnings
and assets, the entity restates those items for consistency.

Identification, regular measurement, and reconciliation of accounting
methods between statutory financial statements and Group standards
are the responsibility of each entity.

The identification and assessment of unrecognized contractual
commitments are covered by a specific report drawn up annually by
the Legal and Finance Departments, working in close collaboration.
The main contractual and regulatory commitments made by the Group,
likely to have a material impact on its financial position, are made
known to the Claims and Commitments Committee (see
Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance
committees) .

Management reporting process

The reporting process is a major element in the control and financial
information process. It is a major tool for monitoring, controlling, and
for the Group s General Management. The reconciliation of accounting
and forecast data, along with the monthly review at each level of the
Group contributes to the quality and accuracy of the information
produced. This method, established by the Controlling and Accounting
Departments, is repeated in all entities of the Group and at each level
of the organization (business unit, division and Group).

The definition of Group report contents and media that are used to

track the achievement of Group objectives is established on a regular

and consistent basis. The financial data in reporting come primarily
from the Group consolidation and reporting tool, and the reporting
formats are standardized. The reports are validated by the country

financial controllers.

This reporting allows tracking the Groups management and
performance indicators, and is articulated around the following:

—monthly reports broken down by published segment, line of
business, and country; these include financial and operating
indicators.

—a quaterly performance chart aiming to provide the Chairman and
CEO and the Executive Committee with the key operating indicators
for the Group and the major events and alerts;

Business reviews at the Executive Committee level are organized by
country under the authority of the Deputy CEO in charge of Finance,
Performance and Europe. Their purpose is to pilot the activity. These
monthly reviews are attended by the Group Finance Department with

the country s Manager and finance function. The Chairman and CEO
participates in the quarterly reviews. These reviews are based on a

formalized report structure. Gathering of information for these reports
is organized for each country according to the Groups reporting

instructions.
Group -wide accounting standards and methods

In order to draw up projected and actual consolidated statements, the
Group has opted for the unification principle which implies:

— homogeneity of the reference system, the accounting methods and
consolidation rules;

—the standardization of reporting formats;

—and the use of a common consolidation and reporting application
within the Group.

Within the Groups Accounting Department, the Department of
Accounting Principles is responsible for defining and disseminating
the Groups accounting policies under IFRS standards. It also keeps
an eye on norms evolution and formalizes on a systematic and
structured basis the IFRS Group accounting policies through the
Groups accounting manual, closing instructions, and information or
training meetings.

This system is completed by the existence of accounting principles
correspondents in the countries and divisions. It identifies accounting
problems encountered locally, disseminates the Groups accounting
policies in divisions, countries, entities and accounts departments and
ensures that the training needs of personnel with responsibility for the
efficient application of the Group s accounting policies are met.

ISO 9001 Quality Certification for the Accounting
Department

Since 2001, Orange SA has obtained the ISO 9001 v2000 standard
certification in the area of ISO Management for accounting services in
France, issued by AFAQ/AFNOR. Since 2007, all of the departments

in the Group Accounting Department based in France have received
ISO 9001 v2000 certification. It was decided that, starting from 2019,
the process for the ISO 9001 standard v2008 and v2015 awarded by
AFNOR would not be renewed foranew three-year certification cycle.

The management of the Accounting Department is considering
adopting a new approach to monitoring performance and the
achievement of objectives.

2.2.3.2 Summary of works on Internal Control
implemented under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act

Because it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Orange is
subject to the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 404 of this Act, the
Chairman and CEO and the Deputy CEO in charge of Finance,
Performance and Europe must prepare a report in which they make

a statement about the effectiveness of internal controls in the
production of the Group s financial statements, prepared in accordance

with IFRS and presented in the Annual Report — (Form 20-F) that is filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United
States. The Statutory Auditors make their own internal control
evaluation. The reports of the management and the Statutory Auditors

are included every year in Form 20-F

To better meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Act, Orange,
under the Groups Internal Control Department, implements a
permanent program to reinforce the internal control culture across the
entire Group.

By applying standards issued by the SEC, Orange is targeting its
internal financial control system on significant risk areas, enabling it to
be more relevant and more effective and to limit the Groups
assessments to the controls covering these risk areas.

Regarding the reliability of financial information, Orange relies on the
internationally recognized framework of the 2013 Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
Orange classifies the five component parts of the COSO under two
headings:

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

—control environment (governance committees, overall policies and
procedures); and

— operational control (flows and processes).

The annual work program, which covers the control environment and
the operational control, is made up of the following main actions,
based on the risks that have been identified:

— perimeter identification : Group Governance Committees, as well as
control environment domains and consolidated entities, whose
scope is in line with the audit of the financial statements;

—-scoping : identification per entity of the relevant control environment
domains and flows and information systems supporting these flows;

— documentation on the internal control system implemented and the
assessment of its effectiveness.

The Group has excluded from its internal control scope of evaluation
as regards Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act the activities and
the assets of the entities acquired in 2019, in Spain the companies
Republica de Communicaciones Moviles, $.L.U. and Suma Operador
de Telecommunicaciones SL.U., in Belgium the companies Upsize
and BKM, in Poland the companies BlueSoft and Essembli, as well
as the groups Secure Data and Secure Link. These entities are included
in the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Group and
constitute 0.6% of the total revenue and 0.4% of the total assets.

Financial internal controls assessment work takes into account the
internal audit work and risk management analyses, as well as work on
fraud (prevention, detection, and investigations).

Furthermore, the Statutory Auditors carry out an independent
evaluation of the financial internal control system.

The evaluation for the 2019 fiscal year did not reveal any material
weakness. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officerandthe — Delegate
Chief Executive Officer in charge of Finance, Performance and Europe
therefore concluded to the operational effectiveness of the internal
control system relating to the preparation of the financial statements.

2.2.3.3

As part of its insurance policy, Orange has negotiated an insurance
plan with the insurance and reinsurance market to cover its main risks.
It is based on programs that are regularly reviewed as part of calls for
tenders organized to select brokers and insurers.

Insurance

This insurance plan is designed to optimize the terms of transfer,
based on the quality of coverage offered and its cost. In addition to
this objective, there is also a security objective, which takes the form
of a contractual, required level of solvency for participants, which is
essential to their continued participation in the subscribed insurance
program.

This insurance plan reflects the nature of the Orange Groups risks,
and is adapted to the capacities offered by the markets to international
companies of comparable size operating in similar business sectors.
The suitability of the Groups existing programs in meeting its needs
is confirmed by the publication of regular studies and benchmarks.

The insurance and reinsurance markets began a rate adjustment in

late 2018, which expanded during fiscal year 2019 and continues with

the program renewals for 2020 in most of the lines of insurance
(property damages and business interruption, financial lines ). Ona
selective basis, this includes an erosion of the available market
capacities, and/or a significant increase in franchises andself  -retentions
left to the policy -holders, especially for any risks involving damage or
that include exposure to natural disasters, etc. This market trend could

last for another 24 months.

Despite this context, the Group has been able to renew its major
programs without altering its essential capacities and guarantees.

This policy has also made it possible to expand the scope of insurance
coverage to nearly all of the Groups subsidiaries (>90% of revenues.

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

Subsidiaries have been gradually integrated into the insurance umbrella
taking into account the regulatory changes affecting the regional
locations of our assets and activities.

In addition, the insurance policy in place includes a risk management
strategy designed to identify any Group vulnerabilities and implement
preventive actions in line with the development of the Group s business,
sites and environment. It organizes regular visits to Orange s main sites
in France and abroad, in partnership with the engineering of our
insurers and brokers, which reinforces this strategy.

The transformation of a primarily telecoms business into a
multi-services operator generates new risks, requiring it to constantly
adapt financing in line with the nature of the business activities, as well
as constant revaluation. Our insurers and service providers are informed
of these developments through periodic discussions, and dedicated
insurance policies are introduced.

Furthermore, the Group Insurance Division works with the relevant
Group entities, providing expertise and support for contractual loss
prevention techniques written into agreements with customers and
suppliers.

The main insurance policies that make up the current plan are designed
to protect against the following risks:

—risks of damage to property and substantial financial losses and
technology risks;

—third-party and customer civil liability risks incurred during the
management of the Company and the performance of its activities;

2.2.4 Framework for controlling non

The specific internal control procedures presented below, together
with the policies and measures in place, help reduce the risks identified
by the Group in the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (SNFP)
and the Vigilance Plan. They are presented as they relate to five
challenges:

—the effect of our activities in terms of respect of human rights and
fundamental freedoms;

—the employment -related consequences of our activities;

—the social consequences of our activities;

—the environmental impacts of our activities;

—the management framework for suppliers and subcontractors.

These challenges were studied in an initial salient analysis in 2019,
consistent with the risk factors presented in Section 2.1.4.
risks.

Orange is attempting to develop a methodology to analyze the effects
of its activities on its stakeholders in order to adapt its Corporate Social
Responsibility policy to foster ongoing improvements. To that end,
Oranges policies are derived from the definition and criteria chosen in
the Reporting Framework based on the United Nations Guiding
Principles (UNGP) launched in February 2015 on salient issues (related
to human rights) ‘”. This methodology is based on:

—an assessment of the severity of the risks in terms of their effects
on people, independently of any policies or action plans implemented
by Orange to mitigate the consequences thereof;

Non-financial

—risks associated with the Company s vehicle fleets.

The risk of damage to the telephone poles and open -wire lines of the
overhead fixed -line network due to natural disasters remain self-
insured. The resulting financial expenses are monitored in consultation
with the Groups in -house experts and the relevant broker. Regarding
these expenses, the Group does not consider the case has been

made for an alternative financial structuring of these risks, and the
traditional markets (insurance and reinsurance) do not offer an adequate

risk transfer solution.

Specific policies are negotiated and set up, including:

— assistance for employees on business trips or who are expatriated;
—work site insurance (real -estate or construction projects);
—mnew activities (financial activities, banking).

The total cost of insurance cover provided by the Orange Group
program in 2018 amounted to approximately 0.042% of revenue for
the fiscal year.

Moreover, through its inhouse brokerage insurance firm, the Group
contributes to the design of affinity programs to enrich the products
and services offered to customers.

The Group Insurance Division s management process, which involves
various outside parties (consultants and brokers) at different stages,

encompasses internal controls including the control environment,
governance and ethics. Employees are briefed in the areas of ethics

and anti -corruption.

-financial risks

—on the likelihood of occurrence, given the scope of the Group,
independently of any policies or action plans implemented by Orange
to mitigate the occurrence thereof;

—on Oranges ability to propose a remedy, i.e. for the effects resulting
from any policies or action plans developed by Orange.

Since 2017, Orange has produced several studies on its
socio -economic footprint and in 2019 started to look closely at the
notion of impact analysis.
2.24.1 Effects of our activities in terms
of respect of human rights

and fundamental freedoms

The framework for controlling breaches of human rights and
fundamental freedoms aims to prevent non _ -financial risks relating to:

—the inappropriate disclosure or modification, by Orange or its
business contacts, of the personal data of customers or other third
parties, notably during cyber -attacks;

—exposure to risks of corruption, or behavior by individuals or groups
that does not comply with its business ethics, or even fraudulent
behavior;

—the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Orange
or its business relations.
2.2.4.1.1 Protecting Personal Data

Group policy in terms of protecting personal data

Personal data protection is included under the general framework of
data security implemented by Orange, which covers both corporate

and personal data. It is one of the major areas Orange plans to develop

to accompany its strategic plan Engage 2025 and is covered by a
Security Policy aimed at the continuous improvement of security based

on risk management and assessment (particularly cyber _—_-security). It
is updated regularly to mitigate the effect of incidents, even crises,
depending on the threat level and changes in the environment.

The Group is backed by international standards such as ISO 27001

for data security and ISO 27005 for risk analysis in order to guide any
measures taken. The Group holds several certifications, attesting to

the quality of the resources devoted to enhancing the protection of
Orange s assets and those of its customers. These certifications cover
scopes as varied as Orange Money, for African subsidiaries, Plazza,
the Groups employee network, the design, engineering and support

of corporate services for OBS and European subsidiaries, etc.

These standards help to enhance security management within the
Company by providing a common framework at the Group level;
security staff can then decide more effectively which measures to take
to prevent threats, and even detect them more quickly, contain them
and eradicate any that do occur. The technical and organizational
mechanisms derived from the Global Security Policy are formalized in
the Group Security Standard, which focuses on the essential security
requirements designed to be applied throughout the Group.

The following are available for security staff:

—the Group Security Standard, which defines 80 minimum rules to
be implemented in three areas: data security, physical security and
personal security in the face of country risks. Each of these rules
receives a score of 0% to 100%, and then the 80 rules are averaged,
which gives the overall score of the country. Every year the
companies are evaluated in order to verify compliance with the
security standard. The aim is to reach or maintain a score above
90% for the European countries and MEA;

—a framework covering the Groups Crisis Management Policy;

— seminars for sharing best practices updated regularly in the areas
of physical security, data security, crisis management and business
continuity, held annually with the countries of Europe and Africa;

—aset of provisions enabling the implementation of the Group Security
Policy specifically for personal data that takes into account changes
in the European regulatory framework.

Orange has thus developed a procedure to respond to any
security -related event or incident involving personal data, a Personal
Data Security Guide, a security guide for sensitive Orange data which
presents elementary security rules and actions to follow in order to
identify sensitive information and secure itfromend -to-end throughout
its life.

Several security monitoring centers also constantly monitor the
differences between security policies and alerts that may be triggered
in the event of suspect activities. These alerts are analyzed and
remediation procedures are monitored according to the level of
criticality.

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

Aside from personal data security, Orange strives to master all the
requirements set for the responsible use of personal data. Accordingly,
ad hoc processes are put in place to assist entities in analyzing the
compliance of the data processing necessary for the Group s activities.
To allow for suitable coverage, the Group is backed by the creation of
a wide network of correspondents who have developed skills in terms
of personal data protection; sharing these skills can lead to
improvements throughout the network including when new entities
are added to the Group. These networks comprising hundreds of
people with multidisciplinary profiles are helping to develop a consistent
approach for the implementation of the framework of protection and
interpretation of legal regulations in this area within the Group. This
framework applies in intra -group relations and with all the Groups
partners and service providers.

Furthermore, this will require the involvement of all Group employees.
This will involve offering general in-house training sessions. By means
of these different approaches, a very large number of teams have
learned about the principles of data protection. The aim is to focus
more and more on specific training for jobs in project management
and HR, among others, and on providing more information on career
paths for new hires within the Group.

Governance and implementation framework

Governance of security regarding the protection of corporate data of
the Group is the responsibility of the Executive Director of the Strategy
and Cyber -security Division. It is implemented by the Group Security
Department under his authority. All the documents and processes
comprising the security policy are communicated by the Director of
Group Security to the community of security officers in the companies
and to the Group s executive directors. Ona daily basis, multidisciplinary
committees monitor the projects from an operational standpoint.

The security policy, like the policy relating to personal data protection,
is presented every year to the Groups Risk Committee and during
various internal control reviews. Enforcement is verified as part of the
annual evaluation of the companies under the authority of the Group s
Security Department, and deviations are covered by action plans
managed locally or even monitored by the Group on certain subjects
such as managing identities and access, encryption of messaging and
workstations. The findings of the assessments focus on proposed
areas of improvement and help inform management and members of
the Executive Committee. These assessments are completed by
penetration tests to verify resistance to cyberattacks. A report is made,
including an action plan, and sent to the CEO of the entity.

To deal with personal data protection risks, a specific Group __ -level
structure and governance have been put in place in the entities.
European regulations have made the function of Data Protection
Officer key in organizations, based on existing practices such as the
role of Correspondant Informatique et Liberts | (CIL) (data protection
correspondent) in France. In this respect, in 2006 Orange appointed

a CIL. When the European regulation was published in 2016, the
Groups Executive Committee appointed a Group Data Protection
Officer (DPO) before it became a legal requirement. The entry into force

of the GDPR from May 25, 2018, enabled the deployment of an
appropriate compliance approach specifically in the Group s European
entities that takes into account a risk-based approach as promoted
by this new regulatory framework. This approach includes components

for organization, governance, documentation, raising awareness and
training and verification. Alongside the Groups Security Policy, this
approach contributes to creating the conditions to mitigate risks in
relation to personal data processed by Orange.

A network of Data Protection Delegates was formed in the entities so
as to provide guidance on the significant changes in the new European
regulations, which affect numerous Group entities in Europe, and in
certain cases outside of the European Union. This also helps to monitor
the status of regulations in the countries where Orange is present.

2.2.4.1.2

Risk of breach of ethical rules

These delegates contribute, including from the time that new offerings
are being designed, to the implementation or adaptation of the
framework for processing personal data, notably in terms of
transparency and systems for managing risk assessments, or even
impact analysis. The selected approach calls for continuous,
operational and educational improvement, in order to disseminate the
data protection culture among employees. A set of documents to
strengthen governance. Governance also involves legal monitoring.

The tone communicated by senior executives and managers at all levels in the Group.
Organization and resources to implement risk measurement actions
A risk analysis to define a proportionate approach
Policies and local adaptations for appropriate actions
awareness of all employees through suitable communications and targeted training projects
Controls to measure the effectiveness of the program

The main components of this approach, led by the Group s Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer and the entire Group Executive Committee,
aim to identify and analyze risks, roll out action plans to limit their effect
on operations, make available a set of relevant and effective controls,
and inform, train and share best practices.

This approach stems from the desire by Orange to place ethics at the
heart of its activities and its relations with stakeholders, going beyond
strict adherence to the law.

The slogan Tone from the Top recommended by senior executives
and managers is clear: enshrined in the Groups Code of Ethics and
its Anti-corruption policy, this commitment of responsibility and integrity
is reaffirmed regularly and publicly.

Governance _ established at several levels of the Company goes
hand -in-hand with mastering risks of breaches of ethics:

—at the level of the Orange Board of Directors: the specialized
committees of the Group s Board of Directors (Audit Committee and
GCSER committee);

—at the level of the Orange Executive Committee, these are the Group
Investment Committee, in which the Group s Director of Compliance
participates, and the Risk Committee (including an annual Risk
Committee meeting devoted to compliance in the presence of the
Lead Director);

—at the level of the Group Ethics Committee whose members are
appointed by the Chairman of Orange, in charge of dealing with
issues relating to ethics within the Group;

—since July 2019, the Ethics Committee has also played the role of
Strategic Committee for managingnon —-financial performance and
validates the Orange Groups SNFP and the Vigilance plan.

In terms of operational management, risk control is handled at

several levels:

—within the Group s Compliance Department created by decision of
the Chairman and CEO in 2012. This department acts under the
authority of the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports to the Orange

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

General Secretary. This team is in charge of designing, rolling out,
coordinating and controlling Group -wide compliance programs. It
is made up of 9 people;

—within the Compliance network made up of the Chief Compliance
Officers (CCO) and the Compliance Officers (CO), in the subsidiaries,
divisions and departments. The CCO are appointed by the members
of the Executive Committee, and the COs are appointed by the
head of the entity or division. They are responsible for coordinating
and supervising the roll -out of compliance risk control programs;

—within the network of Ethics Advisers, appointed by the members
of the Executive Committee and the CEOs of the subsidiaries and
responsible for seeing to it that the ethics policy is transmitted to
the teams.

NB: The assignments carried out by these networks are backed by
the expertise and resources of the Group Audit Control and Risk
Management Department (DACRG) and the Group Legal Department.

Control:

This compliance approach is controlled under the Group internal
control policy as well as by audits by the Group (IFACI certified).

Itis also reviewed and audited by the Statutory Auditors as part of the
audits on the control environment and the certification of the financial
statements.

Outside commitments by Orange:

Orange participates in various sector -basedortheme -based collective
initiatives, devoted to the development and sharing of best practices

of integrity, namely in the International Ethics Committee of MEDEF,
the Forum of committed Enterprises of Transparency International, as
well as the Business Ethics Circle.
Orange s ethics policy

The Groups ethics approach is enshrined in the Code of Ethics and
is based on four strong commitments of respect, integrity, quality and
team spirit.

Oranges Code of Ethics describes the policy principles with respect
to stakeholders and the principles of individual behavior guiding the
conduct of employees in their professional activities.

These policy and behavioral principles reflect the same principles set
forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by organizations
such as the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the OECD as
well as the commitments upheld by Orange in terms of social
responsibility.

This ethics policy is implemented by the network of Ethics Advisers.
It consists of the following:

—an analysis of the risks of a breach of ethics;

—a breakdown of the various components of the Group Code of
Ethics, such as the supplier code of conduct;

—a Group whistleblowing system with additional local systems;
—principles for preventing and managing conflicts of interest;

— programs for ethics training and raising awareness through videos
and e -learning ;

—an annual Ethics and Compliance Day .

The anti-corruption compliance policy is implemented by the CCOs
and the COs.

Itis based on the principle of zero tolerance with respect to corruption
and influence peddling, formalized in a letter of commitment signed
by the members of the Executive Committee. It includes:

—analyses of corruption risks as applied to the Group, subsidiaries
and relevant entities in order to identify the major risks and target
controls to be putin place according to the Group Risk Management
methodology, using a risk clusters approach;

—the Group anti -corruption policy (updated in November 2017) with
local applications where necessary, as well as its Guiding Principles
updated in October 2018;

—of the Group procedures adapted to local situations:

— a fraud and compliance evaluation procedure (due diligence),
based on risks and applied to B2B customers, partners and
intermediaries,

— a Compliance Clause included in contracts or invoices, updated
in 2018,

— a Gifts and Entertainment policy that includes any benefits
received or offered; dedicated applications are gradually being
rolled out in order to trace managerial declarations and validations
of any crossing of defined thresholds;

—the whistleblowing system (described above as it relates to the
ethics policy) dedicated to gathering reports of violations or fraud
in the areas of accounting, internal control and auditing, in terms of
corruption and influence peddling or conduct or situations that
could constitute a serious violation of human rights and fundamental
freedoms, affecting the health and safety of persons or the
environment;

—principals for preventing and managing conflicts of interest;

—training and awareness raising tools for preventing corruption:
e-learning and teaching materials for classroom training sessions

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

are provided to the Compliance Officers and Ethics Advisers so they
can organize training and awareness raising programs as close as
possible to the needs of the entities and the risks identified.

Adherence to economic sanction programs

Being a global group in a constantly changing environment requires
keeping up to date with economic sanction programs and numerous
and changing embargoes. Therefore, since 2013, the Group has
strengthened its knowledge and its risk management in this field and
has issued a Group policy and a legal and compliance guide on
international economic sanctions, and implemented a due diligence
procedure involving its customers, partners and intermediaries in order
to safeguard its business and international development as much as
possible.

The economic sanctions committee analyses changes in international
regulations as applied to the Group, adjusts the internal system in
place accordingly and supervises the reviews assessing the Groups
exposure to that risk.

Tax policy

Owing to its business activities, Orange has assets and personnel in

a number of countries. Orange pays fees and taxes in the countries
in which it operates, complying with the laws in each of those countries.
Orange publishes information relating to operating fees and taxes in
Note 10 Taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements,
including information on the breakdown of taxes payable by
geographical area or by tax consolidation group over 3 fiscal years
(see Section 3.3.1), and in its annual report of Tax Transparency,
available on the website orange.com/Group/Non-financial Reporting.

The Group s approach on tax is based on three fundamental principles:
—compliance with the law in each country;

—respect for the principles of the OECD: Transfer Pricing Guidelines
for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations ;

—regular assessment of practices and comparison with existing
solutions on the market to ensure their relevance.

Orange in no way seeks to evade paying taxes and duties, notably
through complex and opaque structures. Orange publishes the list of
countries in which the Group has interests in its Universal Registration
Document.

The Group Tax Director, directly reporting to the Deputy Chief Executive
Officer, Finance, Performance and Europe, has a specialist team. The
Group has put in place a code of tax ethics that applies to all the
Group s tax advisers and that concerns all tax operations. The Code
specifies that the Orange Groups tax advisers may propose the tax
options most favorable to the Orange Group, knowing that their
suggestions must be made based on an analysis that is professional,
honest, objective and respectful of the law .

Every year, the tax process is subject to a review under the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (see Section 2.2.3.2 Summary of works on Internal Control
implemented under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). This
control process covers Orange SA and its main subsidiaries. Both the
work conducted by Orange and the independent assessment by the
Statutory Auditors have reached a satisfactory conclusion for the 2019
fiscal year.

Thanks to its tax policy described above, Orange has not identified
any risk of tax evasion as liable to create risks for the Group s operations
or reputation.

2.2.4.1.3 Breaches of human rights

and fundamental freedoms

Any potential or actual breaches of human rights and fundamental
freedoms that Orange may have caused are taken into account as
part of Oranges 2019 vigilance plan.

Commitments by Orange to the protection
of human rights and fundamental freedoms

Oranges policy of compliance and promotion of human rights is
shown by a number of commitments:

—Orange was one of the first companies to sign up to the United
Nations Global Compact in 2000. Respecting the fundamental
principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
by the International Labor Organization explicitly features in the
Groups Code of Ethics. Orange thus asserts its commitment to
respecting and promoting fundamental human rights in its activities
and sphere of influence, in particular in supporting and promoting
freedom of expression and respect for privacy worldwide. The
Group also confirms its commitment to ensuring that these rights
are respected by each of its employees and managers, both internally
(employee relations) and in its relationships with its customers,
suppliers and subcontractors;

—in 2006, Orange signed a global agreement on fundamental social
rights with the Global Union Alliance (UNI). Orange s management,
the UNI global union and its French trade union members, and
Orange s representative in the Global Union meet twice per year to
review current international operations and major development and
acquisition projects;

—Orange published its first report on respect for human rights,
prepared according to a reporting framework in line with the United
Nations Guiding Principles on corporations and human rights in
2017, as well as its third declaration on the non = _-use of modern
slavery (orange.com/Group/Non-financial Reporting).

Impact study on human rights and fundamental liberties

Since 2012, as part of its annual impact assessment of human rights
or EIDH (measurement of the difference between the commitments
made by States (human rights in principle) and the possibility of these
rights being enjoyed in practice in the countries (human rights in
practice)), Orange has asked Verisk Maplecroft, a specialist external
firm using a methodology based on the UN and OECD standards, to
carry out a customized assessment of the risks incurred in terms of
compliance with human rights in each country where Orange operates,
in to assess and target its actions. This multi _-criteria analysis notably
includes the risks of corruption, breaches of democracy and freedom
of expression, the degree of digital inclusion, human security,
discrimination, etc.

Member of the GNI for the promotion of human rights
and fundamental liberties

Orange is strongly committed to promoting freedom of expression and
respect for privacy in the ICT sector, in particular within the Global
Network Initiative (GND), a multistakeholder platform, including Internet
operators, NGOs, universities and socially responsible investors.
Orange and its peers meet regularly as part of this body to exchange
best practices relating to government requests in the telecommu
nications sector. More specifically, they deal with potential conflicts
between the commitment and duty of sovereign governments and the
responsibility of telecommunications companies with respect to human

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

rights (network interruptions, illegal Internet content, etc. _). By pooling
the resources of every operator, it makes it possible to perform a
complete analysis of the legal and regulatory framework country by
country and to establish a dialog with governments and international
institutions (United Nations, European Commission, the Council of
Europe). It is aimed at making recommendations on local policies or
laws in the interest of respecting freedom of expression and respect

for privacy throughout the world.

The GNI principles updated in 2017 provide a common framework at
Group level for the preparation of policies and procedures relating to
freedom of expression and respect of privacy in the ICT sector. Each
year on its website, Orange reports on the ways in which the Group
applies these principles(see orange.com/Group/Non-financial Reporting)

Any demands by governments that could violate freedom of expression
or fundamental liberties are treated locally by Orange, but under the
authority of the Groups General Secretary and the Group Corporate
Social Responsibility Department in order to ensure that every demand
respects the required formal legal or regulatory requirements as
analyzed by the GNI. Thus, Orange ensures that an official request in
writing has been received by the manager of the relevant entities, and
that it has been subject to an internal report to the Group. A synthesis
of these elements as well as the guidelines set forth by the Group CSR
Committee are presented to the Ethics Committee.

Backed by its membership in the EDH (Entreprises pour les droits de

lhomme) association, an organization grouping together 16 of the

largest French companies, Orange has deployed e -learning training

which is available in 90% of the countries in which the Group operates

to disseminate its main principles among its employees.

2.2.4.2 Employment -related consequences
of our activities

The framework for controlling non -financial risks related to the
employment -related consequences of the business concerns:

—the difficulty for Orange to obtain and retain the skills needed for its
business;

—the prevention of internal and external human risks relating to health
and safety;

—the preservation and protection of human rights and fundamental

freedoms in relation to its employees or those of its supply chain.

2.2.4.2.1 Ensuring the necessary skills
for business activities

To support the growth ambitions identified by the strategic plan Engage
2025 and adapt to a constantly changing world, the Group places in
particular artificial intelligence and data at the heart of its transformation.
An ambitious plan for upskilling and professional reconversion will go
into effect in the next five years in order to give Orange employees an
opportunity to master the new technologies.

Employment and key skills

Signed in February 2017 with the labor unions, the agreement on
recognizing skills and qualifications has led to a profound change in
the Orange Employment and Skills policy, with the identification of
expertise in the areas of security — cyber -security, data management
and AI, development, Cloud virtualization and key skills (such as using
and securing data , the entrepreneurial spirit and working together ).

A new jobs and skills standard has been introduced, in France
initially. There are plans to roll it out internationally during 2020.
For Orange SA, thanks to the performance reviews conducted in
2019, every employee has been placed in a job under the new
standard, his or her level of expertise and every relevant skill have been
specified and skills mapping has been conducted. A comparison with

a forecast of necessary skills then makes it possible to identify any
gaps, and depending on their nature, to determine the best solution

for filling them: transformation of existing skills through Orange
Academy, outside recruitment, mobility, subcontracting, etc.

Skills development

Orange offers all of its employees a tailored learning experience that

is flexible and adapted to the persons context and needs, notably
thanks to Orange Learning. This tool, currently being deployed within
the Group, is a tailored learning space which enables every individual

to access their development plan easily, as well as training via a single
catalog: continuously accessible digital content, multi-modal training
combining digital and classroom learning, learning and sharing
communities, etc.

Compensation

Compensation policy is a fundamental component of management,
designed to meet the Orange Groups strategic objectives and is
consistent with other HR policies (recruitment, career development,
training and working conditions). Its particular aim is to recognize the
individual and group contributions to customer satisfaction and to
sharing value in all of the countries. It encourages the balance between
economic performance and social quality. It aims to attract the new
skills that the Group needs.

The cost of the compensation policy must be funded by each business
unit taking into account anticipated growth in revenue, and the policy s
foreseeable consequences on reported EBITDAaL.

2.2.4.2.2 Occupational health and safety

Any real or potential negative effects on health and safety that Orange may
have caused have been taken into account in the 2019 Vigilance Plan.

Group occupational health and safety policy

Oranges commitment on occupational health and safety is led by its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: on January 21, 2017, in a third
policy communication on health, safety and quality of life at work,
Orange reaffirmed its enduring commitment in these areas. Protecting
its employees occupational health and safety and improving their
quality of life at work contributes fully to Orange s aim to be a leading
employer in its sector.

This policy is based on the global health and safety agreement, signed

in November 2014, and the laws and regulations in force in each
country. This agreement commits our partners and subcontractors.

In line with these actions, the Group deployed a Vigilance Plan in 2019,
pursuant to the Law of March 27, 2017 (see Section 4.6 Duty of
vigilance).

Orange group s global health and safety agreement (2014)

In line with the Groups health and safety agreement, and as part of
the vigilance plan, different measures have been deployed to
continuously improve the quality of life at work for the Groups
employees:

—the definition of a common Group platform in terms of occupational
health and safety, based on a policy of participation by all the players
including a dialog with employees in the area of occupational health
and safety, the promotion of any initiative to participate in health
protection programs adapted to the context and local practices, as
well as non -discrimination in terms of health for employees and
special vigilance regarding vulnerable groups in terms of heath;

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

—the implementation of an occupational health and safety
management system in all Group companies as part of a continuous
improvement approach;

—specific discussion of healthcare costs coverage in the African region;

—the need for specific vigilance to ensure that Oranges service
providers have their own health and safety policy. Subcontractor
accident rates are closely monitored, in particular by the health and
safety officers and OH&S experts, with follow -up assessments and
the preparation of action plans.

These actions are supported and monitored by the Risk Prevention
and Occupational Quality of Life Department and presented annually
to the Worldwide Works Council and UNI global union. This
presentation is based on the Group s annual health and safety report.

Social dialogue on occupational health and safety

Social dialogue on occupational health and safety takes place within
the legal or employee representative bodies and takes the form of
agreements signed with social partners.

In France, there are 250 Health and Safety and Working Conditions
Committees (CHSCT) that regularly hold discussions with employee
representative bodies such as the CNSHSCT (National Health and
Safety and Working Conditions Committee) and the CNPS (National
Stress Prevention Committee). Numerous agreements promote the
deployment of the Groups quality of life at work policy and the active
prevention of risks to employee health and safety:

—the teleworking agreement, amended in 2017, makes teleworking
part of an overall economic, social and environmental approach,
with expected benefits in terms of well -being at work and travel time
savings;

—the agreement on the assessment and adaptation of workloads
(2016) sets a methodological framework and common references
for specifically understanding the problems of workloads related to
changes in the workforce and skills;

—the digital transformation support agreement (2016) notably enables
the implementation of individual digital use reports;

——the agreement on the assessment and prevention of psychosocial
risks (2010) notably endorsed the creation of a National Stress
Prevention Committee;

—the agreement on workplace gender equality and work ___-life balance
(2018) offers a framework to facilitate the best balance between
professional and private life for each employee, whilst enabling them
to overcome major life events.

Since December 4, 2019 in France, the Works Councils, CHSCTs and
employee representatives have disappeared pursuant to the Macron
orders modifying the labor code in terms of employee representation
within the Company. Works councils, CHSCTs and employee
representatives are now grouped in a single body: The Social and
Economic Committee (SEC), which is in charge of issues relating to
health, safety and working conditions. It is backed by the Commission
on Health, Safety and Working Conditions (CHSWC)

Internationally, each subsidiary now has a Health and Safety and
Working Conditions Committee or a Health and Safety Committee. In
the Africa and Middle East region, specific training programs for Health
and Safety Committee members have been deployed since the
signature of the global health and safety Agreement.

In Europe, joint work with the UNI Europe union alliance and ETNO
(The European Telecom Network Organization) resulted in the
publication of a guide to best practices relating to workplace safety
taking into account the new labor organizations: Good Work Good
Health II.

Orange group s occupational health and safety
management system (OHSMS)

The OHSMS is based on either the Groups OHSMS guidelines or a
recognized national or international (OHSAS 45001) standard, to be
chosen by the entity or subsidiary. Its deployment enables a shift
towards a real culture of managing occupational health and safety
within the Group.

Training for managers and information sessions for pilot partners
(member of the Management and OH&S expert) are regularly held in
France.

Audits are periodically conducted throughout the Group, according to
a schedule that depends on the framework selected.

People involved in prevention

The OH&S experts and officers support management by providing
advice and local expertise with respect to the prevention of
occupational risks.

In France, the network of over 200 OH&S officers provides the teams
with methodological support and ensures skills development while
continuing to progress professionally.

Internationally, the OH&S officers receive support from the Risk
Prevention and Occupational Quality of Life Department via regular
contacts. This network meets monthly to discuss the major topics of
Risk Prevention and Occupational Quality of Life by Orange including
workplace health, risk prevention, individual well -being, etc.

The organization of occupational health services depends on the
legislation in each country.

2.2.4.2.3 Social dialogue

The Orange Group promotes a substantial structured dialog involving
its employees, labor unions and associations of employee
representatives. With a focus on increased transparency and
collaboration, Orange has set up employee representative institutions
for all scopes. Each of these institutions has its own powers which
improve the social dialogue.

Orange recognizes the right for its employees to have freedom of
association, representation and membership of a trade union in

accordance with the principles set by the ILO convention no. 87 of
1948 on freedom of association and the right to organize. Employees

are free to become members of their choice of trade union or not to

do so.

Worldwide Works Council

The Worldwide Works Council is a social dialogue body created by an
agreement signed in June 2010. It enables all Group employees
worldwide to be represented, and to exchange information with
employee representatives on transnational economic, financial and
social issues.

Its tasks are as follows:

— promote the communication of Group issues to employee
representatives;

—improve the Group s social dialogue on a world level;

—be part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) development
strategy.

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

This Council does not replace existing national representation bodies
nor the European Works Council. It complements the agreement
signed in 2006 with the UNI global union on respect for fundamental
rights. It meets at least once per year on the initiative of its Chairperson
who is the Group s Chairman and CEO or his representative and each
time that exceptional circumstances require it, with management
agreement.

European Works Council

The European Works Council is a social dialog body at the European
level for economic, financial and social issues. It was created by an
agreement signed on April 14, 2004.

Its tasks are as follows:
—develop social dialogue at a European level;

—create a forum for discussion and dialog on broad economic,
financial and social issues at an overall European level that go
beyond the borders of any single country (industrial and innovation
strategy, major investment policies, employment, etc. _);

—complement the national social dialogue bodies, without aiming to
replace or supervise them.

The European Works Council meets at least three times per year, and
each time that exceptional circumstances require it. Its members
regularly receive information on life in the Group and telephone
conferences are organized when warranted by events.

Other national social dialogue bodies

The France Works Council is responsible for ensuring communication
and dialog with the employee representatives from the Group s different
entities in France. This Council meets at least four times a year. It
receives information on the activity, the financial position, and changes
in the Groups employment and structure.

There are also different national social dialogue bodies that enable
employee representatives to be heard. In regions where representative
bodies are not legally required, the Group promotes the creation of
employee forums in order to establish formalized dialogue.

2.2.4.2.4 Promoting diversity and inclusion

In December 2012, Orange formalized its diversity policy, defining
professional equality between women and menas the theme common

to all Orange entities around the world, specifying that every country
has responsibility for the choice at least of another dimension of
diversity corresponding to its economic and societal challenges — for
example providing employment to the disabled.

On July 17 2019, Orange signed a worldwide agreement with UNI
global union on gender equality in the workplace, combating
discrimination and violence, andthe work _ -life balance. Itcan be applied
and adapted in the countries where the Orange Group is present. The
agreement is based on a participative approach by all the players; it

is built around a structured social dialog and monitoring by the Group,
based notably on dedicated local committees.

Since 2011, the Group has also committed to the effective assessment

of its diversity and gender equality policy through GEEIS (Gender
Equality European and International Standard) and GEEIS Diversity
certification and since 2015, by listening to its stakeholders on diversity

by means of a global system.

Gender equality in the workplace

The Orange policy in terms of gender equality in the workplace is
managed by the Professional Equality Strategic Committee, created
in 2011 and consisting of members of the Executive Committee, it has
been deployed in the Group with a focus on four areas:
—equal pay between women and men: a methodology analyzing pay
gaps common to all countries was rolled out by the Group in 2018;

—access by women to positions of responsibility: the Group has set
itself the target of 35% of women on executive management bodies;
this target is made tangible through the talent management policy,
and also mentoring and development programs. It is driven inside
and outside the Group by employee networks (diversity networks);

—diversity in all the Groups jobs, particularly technical jobs; this is
reflected by a number of projects upstream to attract girls into
technical sectors (shadowing program), by hiring and training women
for professional retraining and by raising awareness among recruiters
of the challenges of gender equality;

—work-life balance: this balance is driven by HR policies with numerous
measures and agreements on teleworking, flextime, parenthood
measures and support for employees who are carers.

In 2015, the Chairman and CEO signed on behalf of the Group the
United Nations Women Empowerment Principles, confirming Orange s
commitment worldwide.

For the French scope, this is also reflected in:

—the signing of the Charter of 15 commitments for work _ -life balance
by the Chairman and CEO and the members of the Groups
Executive Committee in 2013, and the signature in 2008 of the
Parenthood Charter;

—the signing in January 2018 by all the labor organizations of the fifth
2018 — 2020 agreement on gender equality in the workplace and
the work -life balance;

—the signing in May 2019 of the Manifesto for the retraining of
women in digital jobs ;

—awareness -raising in workplace equality via an online training
program leading to a workplace equality visa .

Equal opportunity and combating discrimination

Combating discrimination and respect for diversity are constant
concerns throughout an employee s career path, whether it be during
recruitment or during different professional stages within the Company.
Orange regularly revisits its human resources processes to ensure that
in managerial decisions, assessments focus solely on skills, potential
and commitment.

Orange contributes regularly tonumerous analyses ofinter _- generational
management, religion in companies, sexual orientation and the effects

of stereotypes on careers. Orange strives to remain sensitive to weak
signals to take into consideration the effects of various societal themes

in the Company. Regarding sexual orientation, the Group has been a
signatory of the Charter of Commitment to the rights of LGBT individuals

in the Company since 2013 and the UNs Corporate Standards of
Conduct on Tackling Discrimination against LGBTI People since 2017.

In France, several systems are in place to combat discrimination:
dedicated monitoring commission with trade union organizations,
availability to employees and job applicants of the service Allodiscrim
(independent from Orange) to report and deal with any instance of
discrimination, awareness training of employees on stereotypes
through the workplace equality visa .

Concerning the disabled, in France, Orange is implementing the sixth
agreement for employment and the integration of the disabled and for
combating discrimination, signed in June 2017, which covers the
period 2017 -2019. In addition, in October 2019, Orange signed the

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

Manifesto for the inclusion of the disabled in economic life in France,
an initiative promoted by the Secretariat of State in charge of the
disabled. Internationally, since 2015 the Group has been pursuing the
commitments made in the Global Business and Disability Network
Charter of the International Labor Organization, and in December 2019,
it joined the Valuable 500, the global movement bringing together the
500 largest companies committed to promoting the inclusion of the
disabled.

2.2.4.3

The framework for controlling non -financial risks related to the business

Social consequences of our activities

activity s consequences for society refer to the risks identified in
Section 2.1 Risk Factors :

— protection against the potentially harmful effect on peoples health
of exposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunications
equipment;

—the excessive or inappropriate use of telecommunication services
and equipment.

They also cover the more comprehensive notion of responsibility in
terms of products and services. The Groups commitment is backed
by the Meaningful Marketing program and the Groups guidelines in
terms of artificial intelligence.

2.2.4.3.1 Protecting customers health and safety

One of Oranges priorities is to develop safe, responsible, and creative
digital practices. For that reason, Orange carefully follows the advice
of the experts and authorities on the subject of digital technology and
health and promotes their recommendations, particularly those
intended for parents, youth and families in general.

With regard to children, Oranges commitment is supported by the
Better Internet for Kids (BIK) program which aims to give parents and
educators the power to act and offer their children the best of digital.

Oranges policy is thus to assist in the development of appropriate
digital uses and practices favoring creativity, the entrepreneurial spirit
and education through:

—awareness training of employees regarding the challenges of
responsible marketing, by defining Guidelines for product managers,
and by assisting them in implementing projects (for example, no
marketing offers to children below the age of 9, no young children
in Orange advertisements, service offers responding to the concerns
of families);

—initiatives focusing on raising awareness and assisting parents,
educators and children on the safe use of digital technology, in
cooperation with experts and childrens and parents associations;

This policy and monitoring of it are carried out by the CSR and
Marketing teams of the countries in coordination with the Radio Waves
and Health Committee (see Section 2.1.4.3.2
waves) .

Concerns about radio

2.2.4.3.2 Concerns about radio waves

Mobile telephony technologies may increase exposure to
electromagnetic waves of the general population (via new fixed
transmitters) and users (via new mobile equipment or by creating new
behaviors). Emissions of electromagnetic waves are controlled by the
limits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). To
date, there has been no proven effect on health below these
recommended limits. However, until we have the confirmation of

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

additional studies under way, specifically on children and long-term
use, certain health authorities, as a precaution, are drafting
recommendations to limit exposure to radio waves from mobile phones.

Orange implemented a Group policy on radio waves and health in
2007, in which it commits to:

—provide transparent and identical information to all of its stakeholders;

—ensure that the international recommendations of the ICNIRP
(International Commission on Non-lonising Radiation Protection)
and the WHO for mobiles and antennas are applied, including in
the countries of Oranges scope which do not have national
regulations;

— provide health authorities recommendations on the use of mobile
phones to limit exposure to radio waves;

—contribute to scientific research and standardization efforts;

—raise awareness of employees working near or on antennas to the
safety regulations issued by the European Directive 2013/35/UE of
June 26, 2013 and its 2016 -1074 Decree of August 3, 2016, even
in countries not subject to the Directive.

Compliance with this policy and these commitments is ensured at
Group level by the Radio Waves and Health Committee, comprising
a legal expert, a public affairs expert, a doctor, a technical expert and
two CSR experts, who meet each week to analyze health and regulatory
monitoring, coordinate actions at the Groups operational level and
draft Group positions . These positions are communicated to the
Group s Executive Committee as required.

2.2.4.3.3 Thoughts on the use of artificial

intelligence

In its strategic plan Engage 2025, Orange identified the levers of
Artificial Intelligence (automatic training, deep learning, etc. ) as a tool
of its performance, by expanding the digital transformation. Orange
supports the approach described in the document of the High Level
Expert Group of the European Commission recommendations for
Ethics Guidelines for trustworthy AI and supports its major principles:

—the goal of Artificial Intelligence is to make a positive contribution to
societal and environmental challenges;

—solutions based on Artificial Intelligence must always respect the
needs of human beings and be operated under their supervision;

—it must respect diversity and combat any risks of bias or
discrimination;

—the data underpinning Artificial Intelligence algorithms must respect
privacy and be subject to careful governance;

—the robustness and safety of Al-based solutions must correspond
to the specific challenges of each application;

—the functioning of IA-based solutions must be explained in a
transparent and intelligible manner, and the chain of responsibility
must be clear.

In connection with deliberations on responsible Artificial Intelligence,
the Orange Group joined ImpactAI, a collective made up of a set of
artificial intelligence players meeting around two common objectives:
dealing with the ethical and societal challenges of AI and supporting
innovative and positive projects around the world. The DSF has been

coordinating its Observatory since it was launched in 2018, with the
publication of an initial white paper released in July 2019.

2.24.4 Environmental impacts
of our activities

Orange adopts a proactive approach to managing risks and impacts
to help protect the environment against a backdrop of strong growth
in digital usage. Any potential or real damage to the environment that
Orange could have caused was taken into account in its 2019 Vigilance
Plan.

2.2.4.4.1 Orange s environmental commitment

Orange has been working for more than ten years to control its
environmental footprint.

Under COP 21 in 2015, at the time of the Paris Agreement, the Group
made two ambitious commitments:

—reduce by 50% its CO
compared to 2006;

» emissions per customer use in 2020

gradually incorporate the circular economy into its processes and
its organization.

Orange confirmed its commitment to the climate during the United
Nations summit for Climate Action in New York in September 2019,
by signing alongside other major corporations the pledge under the
United Nations Global Compact for an increase limited to 1.5...C. This
commitment is aimed at adopting climate objectives covering the
Companys operations and value chain 1) limiting the temperature
increase to 1.5...C by 2100 compared with pre-industrial levels and 2)
reaching Net Zero Carbon no later than 2050.

As part of its strategic plan Engage 2025 announced in
December 2019, Orange made the commitment to a Net Zero Carbon
footprint by 2040, which is ten years before the GSMA target, and the
recommendations by the IPCC for a limit of 1.5 degrees.

Having a Net Zero Carbon footprint by 2040 means:

—first of all, having reduced its greenhouse gases to the fullest
extent — scopes 1, 2 and 3 — by 2040;

—contributing to carbon sequestration for an amount of carbon
equivalent to residual emissions by 2040 — scopes 1, 2 and partially
scope 3, meaning the emissions on which the Company has a
direct effect. This can be done through capital investments (e.g.
planting forests) or financing negative emissions (certified or verified)
from carbon capture and storage using a natural approach (e.g. in
forests or in agro -forestry) or using technology;

—in addition, contributing to emissions avoided outside its scope, for
example with the marketing of products or services with a better
carbon score than existing products or services — or financing
emissions (certified or verified) avoidance.

NB: This target of Net Zero Carbon by 2040 is taken in the context of

the special report by the IPCC © published in October 2018, which
encourages decision -makers to do their best to limit the average
global warming of the planet by 2100 to 1.5...comparedtopre —_-industrial
levels. This in order to avoid the risk of serious climate disruptions.
Reaching this target of 1.5... by 2100 means Net Zero Carbon worldwide

no later than 2050.

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document
The Net Zero Initiative ‘), in which the Orange Group participates, has
formalized a standard for Net Zero Carbon for businesses in
February 2019.

For Orange, environmental exemplarity is one of the two cornerstones
of its corporate responsibility. This commitment involves various stages
with the intermediary target by 2025 of reaching a decline of 30%
of CO, emissions at the Group level, scopes | and 2, in absolute terms
compared with 2015 levels; to that end, Orange is rolling out a
sweeping energy efficiency plan, is planning to achieve a usage rate
of at least 50% renewable electricity by 2025 and for its residual
emissions expected in 2040, is developing a carbon sequestration
plan.

During the year 2020, the Group will define a target to its scope
3 emissions for 2025. This will enable the Group to commit its suppliers
to further reducing their own carbon footprint.

To become a Net Zero Carbon company, in 2019 Orange developed
an action plan based on a number of simultaneous approaches:
pursuing energy efficiency actions in IT and the networks, developing
new capacities for renewable electricity, with the use of PPAs, the
creation of new solar farms and expanding ESCO programs as well
as a specific policy for its buildings and vehicle fleets. As a priority,
Orange is attempting a real reduction in its scope | and 2 emissions
on which the Group has a direct influence. Orange is acting on the
other part of scope 3 with its main suppliers through the International
Telecommunications Union, the GSMA and the JAC (Joint Audit
Cooperation).

Concerning the Networks and IT, the Group is planning to rely on the
implementation of advanced sleep modes for 5G antennas, to pursue

the eco -efficiency approaches of the data -centers (optimization of the
number, capacity use and electricity consumption) and on multiplying
infrastructure sharing (RAN sharing)

Concerning buildings, the aim is to reduce their consumption by 20%
by 2025 compared to 2015 by installing a 360... management system
in all the main buildings. The aim is to measure, optimize and reduce
energy consumption.

Concerning its vehicle fleets, Orange s action plan from now until 2025
calls for reducing them and electrifying them while seeing to it that
they remain the leading corporate fleet in carsharing in Europe.

Asan active member of ITU, in relation with the Science Based Targets
Initiative (SBTi) GSMA and the International Energy Agency, Orange
has facilitated work and contributed to the creation of a methodology
document to estimate the effects of the Information Technologies and
Communications sector on climate worldwide, then of an industry
document explaining the emission reduction targets to be adopted by

the industry to harmonize with scientific recommendations and maintain
temperature increases at 1.5... by 2100 compared with pre
levels ®.

Orange has also made the commitment to promote the principles of

the circular economy in its organization and its processes in order to
limit the effects of its activities and those of its customers on resources
and raw materials by optimizing its processes. This commitment
breaks down into the targets for 2025 listed below:

—100% of the hardware product lines with the Orange brand (Box,
STB, Djingo) touse aneco -design approach, leading to a reduction
in usage consumption;

—more than 90% of the fixed terminals (Box, STB) distributed by
Orange to be collected, as well as 30% of the mobile terminals by

country in the Europe zone and the equivalent in WEEE volume of
20% of the mobile terminals sold in the MEA zone;

—at least 10% of the mobile sales volume made in refurbished
terminals in the European countries;

— offering an attractive repair service for the mobile terminals sold by
Orange in every European country;

and for its own needs, Orange aims to use 20% of its network
investment budget to purchase reconditioned equipment.

2.2.4.4.2 Environmental monitoring framework

The Board of Directors monitors the risks and opportunities related to
the environment, and notably climate change, via the work by the
Governance and Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee
and the Group Circular Economy Steering Committee.

Monitoring of Orange s environmental commitments takes place at the
Group Executive Committee level based on quarterly reporting by the
Executive Vice-President CSR, Diversity, Partnerships and Solidarity,
for environmental policy, and by the Deputy Chief Executive
Officer — Chief Technology and Global Innovation for the part of the
GREEN ITN2020 energy consumption saving program related to IT &
networks. Monitoring of action plans to achieve the new environmental
commitments by the Group (see Section 2.2.4.4.1 Commitment by
Orange in terms of the environment) will be done by the Group
Executive Committee.

Group circular economy steering committee

The Group has set up this strategic internal steering committee for the
Circular Economy to define and monitor the actions to be deployed
within its businesses, with the appointment of project leaders and a
deployment plan. Under the responsibility of the Group CSR
Department, it comprises decision -makers in the Groups main
business lines: Purchasing, Supply Chain, Marketing, Networks,
Technocenter, etc.

The plan covers several areas, especially:
—eco -design;

— limiting the Groups consumption of critical, non -renewable
resources;

—optimizing waste management;

—the possibility of giving network equipment and consumer handsets
a second life.

Monitoring committee for alignment with the TCFD s
recommendations

To fulfill the recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures) published on June 29, 2017,
Orange has decided to establish a special monitoring committee
managed by the CSR Department with the support of the Carbone

4 firm. The aim of this committee is todo an in-depth analysis of the
risks related to climate change and to the ecological transition and to
identify projects that must be implemented to better fulfill the
recommendations of the TCFD.

A cross -reference table describing Oranges responses to the TCFD
recommendations is available in Section 4.4.2.3

Players involved in environmental awareness
and training

-raising

The Group Environment Department regularly holds discussions with
a network of national and business area contacts comprising around
90 people; each year, it organizes a seminar to discuss best practice
and launch new projects.

Internal communications conducts regular awareness -raising initiatives
with all the Groups employees when key events such as the United
Nations Climate Change Conference and environment days are taking
place.

Initiatives for awareness raising and discussion thus encourage each
employee to include the objectives of responsible growth in their daily
activities. Dedicated training courses are delivered regularly.

Since 2018 in France, an indicator related to controlling electrical
energy consumption was introduced into the calculation of the incentive
bonus, which is part of the compensation of Orange SA employees,
thus raising awareness of this notion; moreover, the Orange LTIP for
the period 2020 -2022 includes an environmental criterion.

Environmental Management System

In order to achieve its targets for reducing environmental impacts and
risks the Group has been progressively rolling out ISO 14001 compliant
Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in its main countries of
operation. The ISO 14001 standard describes how companies should
organize themselves to manage the environmental impact of their
activities. The 2015 version of this standard includes new requirements,
which the Group is gradually incorporating, particularly through
stakeholder dialogue and by taking into account complete life cycle
impacts.
2.2.4.4.3 Management of environmental
compliance risks

Facilities classified for the protection of the environment

The Orange Group uses certain facilities, products and substances
that may present environmental risks (even minor), some of which are
subject to specific regulations. This is the case for facilities classified
for the protection of the environment (ICPE) in France. The significant
increase in the number of sites including ICPE classified facilities in
2019 is due to a revision of the regulations (Heading
ICPE2910 — combustion facilities), which lowered the classification
threshold.

These facilities are the subject of ongoing in-depth analyses by the
Orange group and have led to the adoption of action plans and
preventive maintenance programs, in addition to periodic inspections

as required under French regulations. The rollout of the Environmental
Management System and ISO 14001 certification audits also ensures
compliance with related regulations and controls.

In order to prevent health -related risks (legionnaires disease) and
reduce water consumption, a program to replace cooling towers by
dry systems (called dry coolers) has been in effect in France since
2006, even though the restructuring of technical sites now underway

is leading to a slowdown in the program.

Hazardous substances

Some facilities use regulated products or substances. These are
chlorofluorocarbon (also named CFC gases) or other refrigerants (more
specifically HCFCs or HFCs) contained inair -conditioning installations —
see above.

Orange complies with the European REACH Regulation (Registration —
Evaluation — Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) and has
undertaken to inform its customers of the presence of hazardous
substances as defined by regulations.

Orange also respects the European Directive RoHS II, by which the
Group must comply with the obligations of the producer or those of
the distributor to limit the use of certain hazardous substances in
electric and electronic equipment. As a contract provision, the Group
requests that suppliers apply the European RoHS II directive to all
products that are subject to it, including outside of Europe.

Provisions for environmental risk

The Orange Group believes that its activities as a telecommunications
operator do not pose a serious direct threat to the environment. The
Groups activities do not entail production processes with a severe
impact on scarce or non-renewable resources, natural resources
(water, air) or to biodiversity and, generally, do not pose lethal risks.
This is why no provision for environmental risk has been made in the
Group s accounts.

However, a provision is recognized to cover the Group s obligation to
dismantle technical equipment and restore technical sites.

The provision is set on the basis of:

——dismantling costs (ona per -unit basis for telephone poles, terminals
and public phones, and per site for cell phone antennae) borne by
the Group to meet its environmental obligations;

— annual scheduled asset returns and departures from sites.

In the Groups financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2019, the provision totaled 825 million euros, of which 463 million
euros for Orange SA. It consists predominantly of the cost of restoring
sites of mobile telephony antennae to their former state, reprocessing
of telephone poles, managing electrical and electronic waste, and
dismantling public phones.
2.2.4.5 Management framework

for suppliers and subcontractors

Orange s responsible purchasing principles

Orange has for several years implemented a responsible purchasing
policy which embeds CSR in its supplier relationships and improves
control of social, societal and environmental risks.

This policy is implemented by the Global Procurement & Supply chain,
which is part of the Orange Group Finance & Performance Department
and which ensures consistency among all the companies of the Group,
each of which has its own procurement department. Thus, there are
1,900 permanent employees in 50 countries and territories who
negotiate with 75,000 active suppliers.

Its Group - wide CSR action plan aims to promote the adoption of CSR
commitments by purchasing stakeholders and their application in the
related business processes, and to guarantee the Group s compliance
with the law on the duty of vigilance. All of these principles have also
been adopted by BuylIn, the joint venture between Orange and
Deutsche Telekom, which covers the Groups main purchasing
domains.
This policy was updated in 2018 (available on the orange.com/Group/
Non-financial Reporting) and is designed around the following themes:

— developing balanced relationships with suppliers based on trust,
respect and sustainable commercial relationships;

—contributing to economic performance by creating value and
ensuring the availability of products and services at the best cost,
while preserving competition among strategic suppliers by
establishing an industrial policy that protects the interests of the
stakeholders;

—controlling CSR risks and opportunities related to procurement and
the supply chain, by requiring suppliers to adhere to a code of
conduct and respect for laws and regulations;

— providing the Group and its customers with the benefit of the know-
how of innovative and high -performance suppliers.

It is based on the systematic incorporation of a CSR clause in the
Groups framework agreements as well as into exclusively local
contracts, reinforced by the integration of the Code of Conduct into
the appendices to these contracts. The Code of Conduct describes

in particular the ethical, social and environmental commitments
expected by the Group. Orange thus requires that its partners, suppliers
and their sub -contractors i) respect all national, European and
international rules with respect to ethical and responsible behavior.
This includes, without limitation, standards relating to human rights,
respect for the environment, sustainable development, occupational
health and safety conditions for the employees, corruption and child
protection; ii) adopt and apply ethical standards and the Groups
commitments and to continue to progress in these areas. Orange
supports its suppliers throughout the pre — -contractual and contractual
relationship to ensure the effective implementation of the Code of
Conduct.

Oranges CSR program was developed in cooperation the CSR and
Procurement teams. It covers all the subsidiaries and is based on five
pillars:

—clear CSR commitments defined in Oranges Commitments in
terms of responsible procurement . They are also stated in the CSR
clause of the supplier Code of Conduct and apply to all suppliers
(Group and local);

—a strong CSR culture thanks to CSR training sessions for buyers;

—effective CSR risk management based on CSR evaluations and
supplier audits;

—the active search for opportunities through dialog with subsidiaries
and suppliers;

—transparent reporting on the CSR maturity of all the subsidiaries.

In 2019, Orange France procurement had an ISO 20400 maturity
evaluation and obtained the compelling level (3rd level out of 4). It also
obtained the Supplier Relations and Responsible Procurement label
from the French government.

Supplier assessment

Suppliers are assessed at several levels of the contractual relationship,
using several tools.

——first of all on a documentary basis thanks to the use of a recognized
expert (which offers a self -assessment tool based on ISO 26000
for supplier commitment in terms of CSR). The results of the
assessment are used to prioritize the actions towards the most
vulnerable suppliers from a CSR standpoint;

Risk factors and activity management framework
Activity and risk management framework

—then, through on -site audits by an expert partner company either
within the framework of the JAC, or on behalf of Orange in
collaboration with the subsidiaries. In fact, Orange deploys a
coordinated audit program of on -site CSR audits founded on
verification, evaluation, and development of acommon methodology:
audits to assess suppliers compliance with social and environmental
accountability standards (SA 8000, ISO 14001) and, if necessary,
to implement corrective action plans.

The Group has set up a monitoring and alert system for purchasing
and procurement risks related to suppliers deemed strategic to the
organization and whose default could have major consequences on
the Group s operations.

In response to the requirements of the Orange Vigilance Plan, the
supplier assessment program was revamped and implemented in
2019 in the Groups main subsidiaries (see Section 4.5 Suppliers and
subcontractors) and will be expanded in 2020.

Joint Audit Cooperation

Orange also contributes to the development of its standards through

the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) initiative, which is an association of
telecommunications operators (17 to date), grouped together to audit,
evaluate and develop the implementation of CSR principles by the
global suppliers of the ICT segment. Since 2018, JAC has increased
the efficiency of its action thanks to an accreditation program for its
suppliers (JAC Academy) and to its on-site audit methodology. JAC
is also working with other institutions (ITU, BSR, CDP, RMI and GSMA)
to complete its requirements for other CSR priorities, which are climate
change, the circular economy, the traceability of minerals from supply
sources that respect human rights and the environment. JAC welcomes
other telecommunications operators so that it can expand its
geographical coverage (in Asia, South America and Africa), thus
indicating the global nature of its commitment.

BuyIn

BuyIn is the joint venture created by Orange and Deutsche Telekom
in 2011 to group together the strategic purchases of both international
groups. As such, and taking advantage of its scale, BuyIn can achieve
more competitive positions in terms of quality, price and innovation.
This company concentrates the assessments of its suppliers during
calls for tenders. The CSR recommendation that informs this selection
is based on the score of the renown partner used by Orange, the
results of on -site audits by Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) as well as
comments by its own CSR experts.

Every year BuyIn redefines its risk mapping by purchase category, then
conducts an evaluation targeting every high risk category, as well as
the largest markets, in accordance with its code of conduct developed
by Orange and Deutsche Telekom.

In fact, BuyIn ensures that every supplier under contract has a higher
score than the benchmark score defined in the tool of our external
partner, or puts in place a corrective action plan specific to those
suppliers to allow them to reach the required level.

This section contains forward-looking statements about Orange. These
forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
the results anticipated in the forward -looking statements. The most
significant risks are detailed in Section 2.1 Risk factors .

The following comments are based on the consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial
Reporting Standards , see Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements). The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases as from January 1,
2019 using the simplified retrospective method, without restatement
of historical comparative periods (see Note 2.3 to the consolidated
financial statements). Therefore, data on a comparable basis for the
2019 and 2018 fiscal years is presented in line with the accounting
standard IFRS 16. Data is presented on a historical basis for the 2018
and 2017 fiscal years, and on a comparable basis for the 2017 fiscal
year, in line with the accounting standard IAS 17. Moreover, these
changes in accounting standards led the Group to adapt its key
operational performance indicators and define new ones (see

The annual results confirm that all the targets announced by the Group
for fiscal year 2019 were achieved.

Summary of 2019 results

Revenue totaled 42,238 million euros in 2019, up 2.1% in data ona
historical basis and 0.6% in data on a comparable basis compared
with 2018. In data on a comparable basis, this 6.2% growth in a year
was essentially driven by countries in Africa & Middle East. The Europe
and Enterprise segments also contributed to this growth, at 1.4% and
1.0% over a year respectively. All of this more than compensates for
a slight 0.3% decline in France in 2019 and a 1.5% slowdown in Spain
in 2019 due to the market sliding towards —_ low cost offers.

Commercial activity is performing well in a very competitive
environment, and customer bases have been growing. In data on a
comparable basis, convergence offers (10.8 million customers as of
December 31, 2019) increased 3.4% over a year, and the number of
SIM cards associated with convergence offers continue to grow (up
by 5.3%). Broadband offers, which had 7.8 million customers as of
December 31, 2019, also increased by 22.8% over one year. The total
mobile customer base also grew 3.0% over one year, with the number
of customers on 4G services rising 20.1% to 67.5 million customers
worldwide as of December 31, 2019. Finally, Orange Bank had over
500,000 customers from Orange stores, Groupama branches and
digital channels, of which 390,000 were account holders in France.

EBITDAaL was 12,860 million euros in 2019, up 0.8% in data on a
comparable basis. EBITDAaL of telecoms activities (13,019 million
euros) rose 0.9% in data on a comparable basis over one year,
supported by revenue growth (despite the negative effect of
promotional offers one -readers between 2018 and 2019) and by cost
management efforts. The ratio of EBITDAaL of telecoms activities to
revenue was 30.8% in 2019, up 0.1 points in data on a comparable
basis compared with 2018.

Operating income — was 5,927 million euros in 2019, compared with
4,829 million euros in 2018 in data on a historical basis. This rise is
mostly due to the drop in specific labor expenses, as a result of the
counter -effect of the expense recorded in 2018 related to the extension

of the French part -time for seniors plans (TPS) in 2015 for an additional
three years.

3.1.2

Financial Report

Analysis of the Group s financial position and earnings

Consolidated net income totaled 3,226 million euros in 2019,
compared with 2,158 million euros in 2018, an increase of 1,068 million
euros. This increase comes essentially from the rise in operating
income, and, to a lesser degree, the rise in finance costs (thanks in
particular to a lower cost of gross financial debt), which was partly
offset by higher total income tax.

Economic CAPEX stood at 7,293 million euros in 2019, up 0.6% in
data on a comparable basis. The ratio of Economic CAPEX to revenue
from telecoms activities was 17.2% in 2019, stable compared to 2018

in data on a comparable basis. In line with the outlooks announced
by the Group, Economic CAPEX including the network sharing
agreement with Vodafone in Spain rose by around 50 million euros
compared with 2018 (+44 million euros) in data on a comparable
basis, and economic CAPEX excluding the network sharing agreement
with Vodafone in Spain fell slightly (-12 million euros) compared to
2018 in data on a comparable basis. This performance was achieved
against the backdrop of accelerated fiber optic roll-out in France. As
of December 31, 2019, the Group totaled almost 40 million very
high-speed connectable households, an increase of 21.5% over a
year.

2019 vs 2018

In 2019, the revenue of the Orange Group totaled 42,238 million euros,
an increase of 2.1% in data on a historical basis and of 0.6% in data
on a comparable basis compared with 2018.

In data on a historical basis _, the 2.1% increase in Group revenue

between 2018 and 2019, an increase of 857 million euros, is due to:

—the positive effects of changes in the consolidation scope and other
changes amounting to 430 million euros, including the effects of the
takeover of Business & Decision on June 5, 2018, and the
acquisitions of Basefarm on August 14, 2018, SecureData on
January 31, 2019 and SecureLink on July 8, 2019;

—the positive effects of exchange rate fluctuations, which amounted
to 175 million euros, mainly due to the change in the US dollar
(86 million euros) and the Egyptian pound (76 million euros) against
the euro;

—and organic change on a comparable basis, representing a
252 million euros increase in revenue.

In data on a comparable basis , the 0.6% or 252 million euros
increase in Group revenue between 2018 and 2019 was attributable
primarily to:

—the 331 million euros increase in revenue in Africa & Middle East
countries (a 6.2% increase), driven by growth in 15 of the 16 countries
consolidated as of December 31, 2019, with strong performances
from the Sonatel subgroup (mainly in Guinea, Senegal and Mali),
the C te d Ivoire subgroup (mainly Burkina Faso), Egypt, Congo
(DRC) and Morocco. This growth is mostly due to (i) the rise in
mobile only services, as a result of continued growth in data services
and Orange Money (see Section 1.3. Significant events) , and (ii) to
a lesser degree, the development of fixed only services, notably due
to dynamic fiber optic offers, particularly in Morocco, Jordan and
Senegal, partly offset by (iii) the decrease in wholesale, principally
in response to the slump in international incoming traffic;

—the 81 million increase euros in revenue in
1.4%), mainly due to:

Europe (an increase of

— (i) strong growth in convergence services in Belgium, Poland and
Romania, and, toa lesser degree, (ii) increased sales of equipment
and other revenue (enhanced energy offers) in Poland, and (iii)
growth in integration services and information technology in
Poland and Romania,

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

BI) of Orange Bank is recognized in other operating income

— partly offset by (i) the slowdown in wholesale, essentially due to
the drop in activity relating to mobile virtual network operators
(MVNOs) in Belgium and the decrease in call termination rates in
Romania, (ii) the drop -off in fixed only services, largely due to
decreasing use of conventional telephones in Poland, and (iii) the
decrease in mobile only services, particularly in Poland, primarily
as a result of customers migrating to convergence offers;

—and the 75 million euros rise in revenue from services to —_ Enterprise
(a 1.0% increase), due to (i) growth in integration and information
technology services, principally Cloud and cybersecurity services,
and toa lesser degree, the growth in data services, (ii) partially offset

by the downward trend in voice services and the drop in services

and mobile equipment.
These positive items were partially offset by:

—the 85 million euros fall in revenue from services to International
Carriers & Shared Services (a 5.4% reduction), due to more muted
international carrier business, as a result of the downward trend in

the voice market;

—the 80 million euros decrease in revenue in Spain (a 1.5% decline),
against a backdrop of intense competition inentry — -level mobile and
fixed broadband, with numerous promotions on offer. This fall mainly
reflects (i) the decrease in mobile only services, a significant decline
in equipment sales and the decrease in convergence services, due
to the market slide toward low -cost offers, (ii) partially offset by
growth in wholesale, largely driven by increased international traffic
and, to a lesser degree, very high speed broadband access;

—and the 51 million euros slump in revenue in~ France (a 0.3%

decrease), essentially due to:

— (i) the downward trend in fixed only narrowband services
(conventional telephony), (ii) the negative effects, between the
two periods, of e -reader promotions, (iii) the slowdown in mobile
only services (migration of contract packages to convergence
packages and structural slowdown in prepaid packages), and (iv)
the drop in mobile equipment sales, in a market facing a major
global slowdown,

— largely offset (i) by the increase in services to fixed carriers,
principally relative to the construction, operation and marketing
of fiber optic networks, and (ii) by the growth in convergence
services (driven by a larger customer base and the rise in the
Convergent ARPO over 12 months, see Section 7.2.1 Financial
glossary).
2018 vs 2017

In 2018, the revenue of the Orange group totaled 41,381 million euros,
an increase of 1.3% in data on a historical basis and of 1.3% ona
comparable basis compared with 2017.

In data on a historical basis , the 1.3% increase in Group revenue
between 2017 and 2018, an increase of 522 million euros, includes:
—the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations totaling
! 189 million, chiefly attributable to changes in the value of the US
dollar (for 84 million euros), the Egyptian pound (for 27 million euros),
the Jordanian dinar (for 18 million euros) and the Argentine peso
(for 10 million euros) against the euro;

—which is more than offset:

— by the positive effects of changes in the consolidation scope and
other changes amounting to 167 million euros, including the
effects of the takeover of Business & Decision on June 5, 2018,
and the acquisitions of Basefarm on August 14, 2018 and
Enovacom on February 21, 2018,

— and organic change on a comparable basis, representing a
544 million euros increase in revenue.

In data on a comparable basis , the 1.3% or 544 million euros
increase in Group revenue between 2017 and 2018 was attributable
primarily to:

—the 250 million euros increase in revenue in Africa & Middle East
countries (a 5.1% rise), driven by growth in 13 of the 17 countries
consolidated as of December 31, 2018, with strong performances
from the Sonatel subgroup (mainly in Guinea, Senegal and Mali),
Egypt, the C te d Ivoire subgroup (mainly Burkina Faso), Morocco
and Congo (DRC). The increase in mobile only services reflects the
momentum in data services and Orange Money, partially offset by
the decline in wholesale — particularly international wholesale — and
incoming mobile traffic;

—the 163 million euros increase in revenue in France (an increase of
0.9%). This change was mainly due to (i) the favorable effect of
including digital reading offers, (ii) the growth of convergence
services, driven by both the increase in the customer base and the
rise in the Convergent ARPO over 12 months, and, (iii) to a lesser
extent, the increase in mobile equipment sales, (iv) partially offset

Analysis of the Group s financial position and earnings

by the downward trend in fixed narrowband only services
(conventional telephony), the contraction in mobile only services
(mainly linked to the migration of contract offers to convergent offers
and the structural decline in prepaid offers), and the decrease in

wholesale (the growth in FTTH access only partially offsetting the
anticipated fall in revenue from national roaming and unbundling);

—the 117 million euros increase in revenue in Spain (up 2.2%). This
change was mainly due to (i) the development of convergence
services, which benefited from the increase in the Convergent ARPO
over 12 months (driven by the increase inaccesstoveryhigh —_-speed
broadband and content offers) and growth in the customer base,

and (ii) the increase in wholesale (the decline in incoming mobile
traffic being more than offset by the growth in very high -speed

broadband, other fixed revenue and the increase in national roaming);

— (i) strong growth in convergence services in Poland, Belgium and

roaming, incoming mobile traffic) and integration services and
information technologies in Poland,

— partially offset (i) by the slowdown in fixed only services (downward
trend in conventional telephony) and equipment sales in Poland,
(ii) the decrease in mobile only services in Poland and Romania,
mainly due to migration toward convergence offers, and (iii) by
the slowdown in mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)
services in Belgium.

These positive items were partially offset by:

—the 99 million euros fall in revenue from services to International
Carriers & Shared Services (a6.1% reduction), primarily due to more
muted international carrier business (decline in the voice market for
Africa and the Maghreb);

—and, to a lesser extent, the 16 million euros fall in revenue from
services to Enterprises . Between the two periods, the contraction
in fixed only services (voice and data services) and in mobile
equipment sales are almost entirely offset by growth in IT & integration
services.

ods (see Note 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements).

Between 2018 and 2019, Group EBITDAaL included (i) currency gains
of 59 million euros, mainly due to the change in the US dollar and
Egyptian pound against the euro, (ii) the positive effects of consolidation
scope changes and other changes amounting to 35 million euros, and
(iii) the negative effects of the application of IFRS 16 and the change
in operational performance indicators of 337 million euros (see
Section 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis)
Further, between 2018 and 2019, EBITDAaL included the negative
effect, between the two periods, of promotional offers one —_-readers
amounting to 90 million euros, due to positive effects being smaller in
2019 than in 2018 (at 68 million euros in 2019 compared with
158 million euros in 2018).

Indata on acomparable basis , the 0.8% or 99 million euros increase
in Group EBITDAaL between 2018 and 2019 was mainly due to:

—the 0.6% or 252 million euros increase in revenue, despite the
negative effects, between the two periods, of promotions on
e-readers;

—the 3.9% or 185 million euros decrease in service fees and
inter-operator costs (see Section 7.2.1. Financial glossary) , primarily
resulting from (i) the decrease in interconnection costs for
international wholesale, and secondarily, in Africa & Middle East and
Europe, reflecting the decline in wholesale in those countries, and
(ii) to a lesser extent, the decrease in network charges in Spain (due
to the roll-out of fiber optics);

—the 89.2% or 91 million euros rise in other adjusted operating
income and expenses (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) , due
to (i) the increase in other adjusted operating income (reinvoicing as
a result of network sharing, recovery costs, effects of various
litigations, insurance indemnities for damage), essentially in Spain
and Europe, (ii) partly offset by the increase in other adjusted
operating expenses, mostly as a result of depreciation and losses
on customer receivables;

—and the 0.8% or 62 million euros drop in commercial expenses, cost
of equipment and content (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) ,
due to (i) lower commercial expenses and cost of equipment, mainly
in France (as a result of the dramatic slowdown in equipment sales),
(ii) partially offset by increased content cost, essentially in Spain and
primarily due to the higher cost of soccer rights (see Section 1.3
Significant events) .

These positive items were partially offset by:

— 14.1% or 338 million euros growth in other external purchases (see
Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) , mainly in France (purchases for
resale relating to the operation of public initiative networks), see
Section 1.3 Significant events and, to a lesser extent, in Poland (in
line with the development of integration services and information
technologies, and the rise in energy sales);

—the 3.0% or 96 million euros increase in other IT and network
charges (see Section 7.2.1 _ Financial glossary) , mainly for Enterprise
services, due to the increase in integration and IT service business,
and to a lesser degree in France and countries in Africa and Middle
East (extension of 4G network coverage and transformation
projects);

—and to a lesser degree:

— the 0.2% or 16 million euros rise in adjusted labor expenses (see
Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) . Between the two periods, the
effect of the 1.7% decrease in the average employee headcount
(fulltime equivalent, see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) ,
representing a decrease of 2,279 full-time equivalent employees
(mainly in France and Poland), partially offset the effects of wage
policies in France and abroad,

— the 0.8% or 15 million euros increase in adjusted operating taxes
and levies (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), essentially in
African & Middle East countries (notably as a result of increased
activity and the counter effect of the recognition, in 2018, of
provision reversals due to cancellation of tax risks), partially offset
by the decrease in France,

Financial Report

— and the recognition, in 2019, of a 14 million euros expense for
depreciation of financed assets. In 2019, financed assets included
the set -up boxes in France, which are financed by an intermediary
bank and meet the standard criterion of a tangible asset according
to IAS 16 (see Note 8.5 to the consolidated financial statements).

2018 vs 2017

In 2018, Orange Group adjusted EBITDA amounted to 13,005 million
euros (breaking down into 13,151 million euros for telecoms activities
and a loss of 147 million euros for Orange Bank activities), up 2.6%
in data on a historical basis and 2.7% ona comparable basis compared
with 2017. The ratio of adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities to
revenue was 31.8% in 2018, up 0.6 percentage points in data on a
historical basis and 0.6 percentage points on a comparable basis
compared with 2017.

Between 2017 and 2018, adjusted EBITDA benefited from the positive
111 million euros effect of the inclusion of e -reader offers, due to a
positive effect that was larger in 2018 than in 2017 (at 158 million euros
in 2018, compared with 47 million euros in 2017).

In data on a historical basis , the 2.6% or 325 million euros rise in
Group adjusted EBITDA between 2017 and 2018 reflected:

—the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, which amounted
to 28 million euros, mainly due to the performance of the U.S. dollar
against the euro;

—which was more than offset by (i) the favorable effect of changes in
the scope of consolidation and other changes, for 8 million euros,
and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis, for an increase of
345 million euros in adjusted EBITDA.

In data on a comparable basis , the 2.7% increase in the Groups
adjusted EBITDA between 2017 and 2018 resulted mainly from:

—1.3% or 544 million euros growth in revenue, boosted by the
inclusion of digital reading offers;

—the 3.2% or 162 million euros reduction in service fees and
inter-operator costs, resulting (i) mainly from the reduction in
interconnection fees for services to international carriers (linked to
the downturn in traffic), and also from the fall in interconnection fees
in Spain (especially with the reduction in national mobile termination
rates in February 2018) and (ii) to a lesser extent, lower enterprise
service network fees, partially offset by growth linked to the
development of cable offers in Belgium;

—the 107.0% or 93 million euros rise in adjusted proceeds from the
disposal of fixed assets, investments and businesses, mostly for
shared services, in Spain and Poland (mainly as a result of the
disposals in 2018 to optimize real-estate assets);

—the 2.0% or 35 million euros fall in adjusted operating taxes and
levies, mainly in Africa & Middle East countries due to reversals of
provisions following the expiration of tax risks in 2018.

These positive items were partially offset by:

—5.4% or 163 million euros growth in other external purchases,
particularly in France (purchases for resale related to the operation
of networks managed by local authorities), in Africa & Middle East
countries (real estate fees linked to network development and
overheads), in Poland (reflecting trends in energy sales) and for
enterprise services;

Bank customers), and (ii) the increase in depreciation and losses on
customer receivables, (iii) partially offset by improvements in the
operational foreign exchange effect.

With a 0.1% or 4 million euros increase, adjusted labor expenses
remained broadly stable. Between the two periods, the effect of the
2.5% fall in the average number of employees (full -time equivalent),
representing adecrease of 3,533 full — -time equivalent employees (mainly
in France and Poland), offset (i) the effects of wage policies in France
and abroad, and (ii) the higher share -based payment expense (mainly
due to the recognition in 2018 of expenses relating to the Orange
Vision 2020 and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 2018 -2020 free

2019 vs 2018

In 2019, Orange Group operating income amounted to 5,927 million
euros (breaking down into 6,1 12 million euros for the telecoms activities
anda loss of 186 million euros for the Orange Bank activities), compared
with 4,829 million euros in 2018 in data on a historical basis.

In data on a historical basis , the 22.7% or 1,098 million euros rise
in Group operating income between 2018 and 2019 reflected:

—the 789 million euros decrease in specific labor expenses, principally
as a result of recognition of the following:

— a25 million euros expense in 2019 for the French part-time for

seniors plans (TPS) with proceeds of 6 million euros (see Notes 1.8
and 6 to the consolidated financial statements) and 31 million
euros in related premiums,

— a812 million euros expense in 2018 for the French part-time for

seniors plans (TPS) for 773 million euros (see Notes 1.8 and 6 to
the consolidated financial statements) and 39 million euros in
related premiums. The expense recorded in 2018 mainly relates

to the effect of extending the 2015 French part __-time for seniors
plans (TPS) for three additional years;

—the 193 million euros increase as a result of the combined effect of
(i) the 99 million euros rise in EBITDAaL in data on a comparable
basis, as well as (ii) the positive effects on EBITDAaL of foreign
exchange fluctuations (59 million euros) and changes in the
consolidation scope and other changes (35 million euros);

—a 122 million euros improvement in impairment losses on goodwill
and fixed assets (see Notes 7 and 8.3 to the consolidated financial
statements), relating to the recognition of:

— a favorable reassessment of 73 million euros in 2019, essentially
concerning Egypt for 89 million euros. In Egypt, an 89 million
euros provision reversal on fixed assets reflects the countrys
improved economic situation,

— a 49 million euros impairment in 2018, primarily for Niger for
43 million euros. In Niger, the telecoms market sustained a loss
of value in a difficult business environment. The companys
economic and financial position led it, as a precaution, to recognize
a fixed-asset impairment to cover Oranges exposure according
to the best current estimate;

—and the 80 million euros increase in proceeds from the disposal of
fixed assets, investments and businesses (see Note 3.1 to the
consolidated financial statements), essentially due to higher
proceeds from fixed -asset disposals (see Note 8.1 to the
consolidated financial statements), in connection with real-estate
asset optimization programs pertaining to Shared Services and to
a lesser degree to Spain and Poland;

—partly offset by the 63 million euros increase in depreciation and
amortization of fixed assets (see Note 8.2 to the consolidated
financial statements), principally due to (i) increased investments in
recent years, notably regarding the roll -out of very high -speed
broadband networks (fiber optic and 4G) in European countries,
particularly in France, and (ii) the roll -out of mobile networks and the
amortization of new 4G licenses in countries in Africa & the Middle East.

Financial Report
Analysis of the Group s financial position and earnings

2018 vs 2017

In 2018, Orange Group operating income amounted to 4,829 million

euros (breaking down into 4,997 million euros for telecoms activities
and a loss of 169 million euros for Orange Bank activities), compared
with 4,778 million euros in 2017 in data on a historical basis.

In data on a historical basis , the 1.1% or 51 million euros rise in
Group operating income between 2017 and 2018 reflected:

—the 325 million euros increase in adjusted EBITDA;

—a 238 million euros decrease in net expense on the principal
litigations, relating to the reassessment of risk on various disputes,
with a net expense of 33 million euros in 2018, compared with
271 million euros in 2017;

—a 105 million euros reduction in impairment losses on goodwill and
fixed assets (see Notes 7 and 8.3 to the consolidated financial
statements), relating to the recognition of:

— 105 million euros in impairment in 2018, primarily for Jordan for
56 million euros and Niger for 43 million euros. In Jordan, the
goodwill impairment mainly reflects the effects of an uncertain
political and economic climate and strong competitive pressure
on fixed and mobile data markets. In Niger, the telecoms market
sustained a loss of value in a difficult business environment. The
company s economic and financial position led it, as a precaution,
torecognizeafixed -assetimpairment to cover Orange s exposure
according to the best current estimate,

— 210 million euros in impairment in 2017, primarily for the Congo
(DRC) for 120 million euros, Niger for 52 million euros, and
Luxembourg for 19 million euros. In the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), the impairment loss reflected a still -uncertain
political and economic context, a clear decline in purchasing
power, with its effects on consumption of telecommunications
products and services, and continued regulatory pressure. In
Niger, the impairment loss signaled an uncertain political and
economic context and the effects of strong tax and regulatory
pressure. In Luxembourg, the impairment loss was an indication
of strong competitive pressure;

—and, to a lesser degree, (i) the counter effect of the recognition, in
2017, of a 27 million euros loss as a result of the takeover of
Groupama Banque (now Orange Bank) in 2016, and (ii) the 22 million
euros increase from the investments and businesses portfolio review,
with net income of 17 million euros in 2018, compared to a net
expense of 5 million euros in 2017.

These positive items were partially offset by:

—the 438 million euros increase in specific labor expenses, principally
as a result of the recognition of:

— a812 million euros expense in 2018 for the French part-time for

seniors plans (TPS) for 773 million euros (see Notes 1.8 and 6 to

The consolidated net income of the Orange group totaled 3,226 million

—the 1,098 million euros rise in operating income;

—and the 108 million euros improvement in finance costs, net
(see Note 12.2 to the consolidated financial statements), primarily
due to:

— _ acombination of the 233 million euros improvement in the gross
cost of debt excluding financed assets and the 80 million euros
increase in foreign exchange gains, as a result of (i) the 155 million
euros effect of derivatives (cross currency swaps) arranged by
the Group to hedge its financial exposure to subordinated notes
issued in pound sterling, for which the remeasurement in respect
of the foreign exchange risk was not recognized, and (ii) the
51 million euros decrease in interest on bond debt after the
hedging effect,

The consolidated net income of the Orange group totaled 2,158 million
euros in 2018, compared with 2,040 million euros in 2017, an increase
of 118 million euros. This increase was chiefly attributable to:

—the 353 million euros improvement in net finance costs (see
Note 12.2 to the consolidated financial statements), most of which
came from the change in effects relating to the 321 million euros
investment in BT Group, with the recognition of a 51 million euros
expense in 2018, compared with a 372 million euros expense in
2017 (see Note 12.7 to the consolidated financial statements);

—and the 51 million euros rise in operating income;

—partially offset by the 257 million euros increase in income tax (see
Note 10.2 to the consolidated financial statements):

— the counter effect in France in 2017 of (i) tax income of 304 million
euros relating to the dispute over the 3% dividend tax, (ii) partially
offset by the additional current tax expense of 78 million euros
due to the exceptional surtax applicable to fiscal year 2017,
— andthe recognition in Spain ofa deferred tax expense of 86 million
euros in 2018 to reflect the negative effect of strong competitive

out very high -speed fixed broadband networks (FTTH) in France (see
Section 1.3 Significant events) . Between 2017 and 2018, the increase

in the Groups investments in property, plant and equipment and

2019 vs 2018

In 2019, the Orange Groups Economic CAPEX amounted to
7,293 million euros (including 7,265 million euros in the telecom
activities and 28 million euros in the Orange Bank business). The ratio
of Economic CAPEX to revenue from telecoms activities was 17.2%
in 2019, stable compared to 2018 in data on a comparable basis. In
line with the outlooks announced by the Group, Economic CAPEX
including the network sharing agreement with Vodafone in Spain (see
Section 1.3 Significant events) rose by around 50 million euros
compared with 2018 (+44 million euros) in data on a comparable
basis, and Economic CAPEX excluding the network sharing agreement
with Vodafone in Spain fell slightly (-12 million euros) compared to
2018 in data on a comparable basis.

Between 2018 and 2019, the Groups Economic CAPEX included (i)
the positive effects of exchange rate fluctuations, amounting to

26 million euros, (ii) the positive effects of changes in the consolidated
scope and other changes, amounting to 12 million euros, and (iii) the

negative effects of the application of IFRS 16 and changes in operational

performance indicators amounting to 232 million euros (see
Section 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis)

Indata on a comparable basis , the 0.6% or 44 million euros increase
in Group Economic CAPEX between 2018 and 2019 was attributable
mainly to:

—increased investments in veryhigh -speed broadband fixed networks
(fiber, see Section 1.3 Significant events) , mainly in France and, to
a lesser degree, in the countries of Africa & Middle East and Central
Europe, partially offset by lower Economic CAPEX in Spain. Between
the two periods, the Groups investments benefited from external
financing (joint financing received from other carriers, subsidies),
mainly in France, Spain and Poland. As of December 31, 2019,
39.5 million households had connectivity to very high ~-speed
broadband (an increase of 21.5% over one year), including
16.3 million in France, 14.9 million in Spain, 4.2 million in Poland,
and 2.4 million in Romania (following the mutual network sharing
agreement with Telekom Romania);

—partially offset by (i) the increase in fixed -asset disposals in Spain
as a result of the disposal of non -strategic mobile sites (see
Section 1.3 Significant events) , (ii) lower Economic CAPEX in network
real-estate, stores and others, essentially due to increased disposals
of fixed assets as partofthereal -estate optimization drive, specifically
for shared services and in Poland, and (iii) lower Economic CAPEX
relative to leasedhandsets, Liveboxes and other equipmentinstalled
in customer homes and on customer premises, essentially in France,
and to a lesser degree, in Poland and for enterprise services.

2018 vs 2017

In 2018, the CAPEX of the Orange group amounted to 7,442 million
euros (including 7,406 million euros for telecoms activities and 36 million
euros for Orange Bank activities), up 3.2% in data on a historical basis
and 3.5% on a comparable basis compared with 2017. The ratio of
CAPEX to revenue of telecoms activities was 17.9% in 2018, up
0.4 points in data on both a historical and a comparable basis
compared with 2017.

In data on a historical basis , the 3.2% or 233 million euros rise in
Group CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 included:

—the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 26 million
euros;

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

—which was more than offset by (i) the positive effect of changes in
the scope of consolidation and other changes, for 8 million euros,
and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis, or an increase of
251 million euros in CAPEX.

In data on a comparable basis , the 3.5% or 251 million euros
increase in Group CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 was attributable
mainly to:

higher investments in very high -speed fixed broadband (fiber)
networks, mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in Africa & Middle
East countries (notably Jordan, Morocco and Senegal) and in
Poland. In 2018, Group capital expenditure benefited from
co-financing from other operators, mostly in France and Spain. As
of December 31, 2018, 32.5 million households had connectivity
to very high -speed broadband (an increase of 22.4% year-on-year),
including 13.8 million in Spain, 11.8 million in France, 3.4 million in
Poland, and 2.3 million in Romania (following the mutual network
sharing agreement with Telekom Romania);

——higher investments in very high -speed broadband mobile networks
(4G), mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, Africa & Middle East
countries (notably Mali, Morocco and Senegal), and in Poland. As
of December 31, 2018, 4G coverage rates reached 98.6% of the
population in France, 96.9% in Spain, 99.8% in Poland, 99.7% in
Belgium, 97.4% in Luxembourg, 96.9% in Romania, 94.0% in
Slovakia, and 98.0% in Moldova. In Africa & Middle East, 12 countries
(excluding associates and joint ventures) had 4G coverage at the
end of December 2018;

—and, to a lesser extent, (i) the increase in investments in IT and
customer service platforms, mainly relating to transformation projects
in Spain, shared services, and the redesign of information systems
in Africa & Middle East countries, and (ii) additional investments in
network real estate, stores and other assets, mostly in Africa &
Middle East countries and for shared services (linked to the
adaptation and modernization of the real estate portfolio);

—partially offset by (i) the fall in investments in 2G/3G mobile networks
after significant capital expenditure in this area in recent years,
notably in Africa & Middle East countries, and (ii) declining investment
in leased terminals, Livebox and equipment installed on customer
premises, due in particular to the optimization of | Livebox costs in
France and reduced customer project requirements for enterprise
services.

3.1.2.5.1.2 Telecommunications licenses

In 2019, telecoms licenses (see Note 8.4 to the consolidated financial
statements) amounted to 519 million euros, mostly relating to (i) Spain
for 298 million euros, (ii) Burkina Faso for 119 million euros, with the
acquisition of a technologically -neutral 2G/3G/4G license, and (ii)
Guinea for 82 million euros, including the renewal of the current license
with additional spectral resources and the acquisition of a 4G license,
and the acquisition of anewtechnologically -neutral 2G/3G/4G license.

In 2018, acquisitions of telecommunication licenses totaled 200 million
euros in data on a historical basis and mainly involved (i) Spain for
149 million euros (with the acquisition of a 5G license for 142 million
euros), (ii) Congo (DRC) for 21 million euros (acquisition of a 4G license),
and Senegal for 21 million euros (first tranche of the acquisition of
additional 4G frequency blocks).

In 2017, acquisitions of telecommunication licenses amounted to
318 million euros in data on a historical basis and mainly involved (i)
Mali for 152 million euros (acquisition of a universal license renewing
existing licenses and including a 4G license), (ii) Senegal for 76 million
euros (second tranche of the acquisition of a universal license renewing
existing licenses and including a 4G license), and (iii) Jordan for
49 million euros (acquisition of additional 3G frequency blocks).

2019 vs 2018

On a historical basis, the 57 million euros decrease in revenue in
France between 2018 and 2019 stems from (i) the negative impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes amounting

to 7 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis
representing a 51 million euros decrease in revenue.

Ona comparable basis __, the 51 million euros decrease in revenue in
France between 2018 and 2019 is mainly attributable to (i) the
downward trend in fixed only narrowband services (conventional
telephony), (ii) the unfavorable effect of promotional e -reader offers
between the two periods, (iii) the decline in mobile only services, (iv)
to a lesser extent, shrinking equipment sales, (v) partially offset by the
growth in wholesale, driven by the development of fiber optic offers,
in particular as part of the deployment and operation of Public Initiative
Networks (PIN), see Section 1.3. Significant events) .

On a comparable data basis, the customer bases are performing well
in a highly competitive environment:

—the total mobile customer base contracted by only 0.3%
year-on-year, with 21.8 million customers at December 31, 2019.
Contract customers rose 1.1% year-on-year. This growth reflects
both (i) the growth in premium offers, driven by Open convergent
offers (which reached 9.7 million customers at December 31,2019),
and (ii) the growth in entry -level offers, driven by the development
of SIM-only offers, including Sosh digital offers (which totaled

3.9 million customers at December 31, 2019). The prepaid customer
bases are structurally in decline. In addition, there were 15.9 million
4G customers at December 31, 2019, an increase of 6.2%
year-on-year;

—the total fixed broadband customer base increased by 1.7%
year-on-year (198,000 new customers) to attain 11.7 million
customers at December 31, 2019. This growth is driven essentially
by (i) the development of fiber optic offers, with a total of 3.3 million
customers at December 31, 2019, an increase of 28.7%
year-on-year and (ii) by the momentum of convergent offers, which
grew by 2.5%, with 5.8 million customers at December 31, 2019.
Moreover, 7.3 million customers had subscribed to IPTV and satellite
TV offers at December 31, 2019, an increase of 3.2% year —_ -on-year.

Ona comparable basis __, the 51 million euros decrease in revenue for
France between the two periods, a fall of 0.3%, is mainly attributable
to:

—the 232 million euros reduction in revenue from Fixed only services ,
almost exclusively due to the downward trend in conventional
telephony (a fall of 14.1% or 228 million euros). Incidentally the
change in the fixed only broadband ARPO over 12 months (see
Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), in decline by 1.8% between
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 is affected by the
negative impact of promotional e -reader offers between the two
periods;

and a change in operational performance indicators for an amount of

5 million euros.

Further, between 2018 and 2019, EBITDAaL included the negative
effect, between the two periods, of promotional offers one —_-readers
amounting to 90 million euros, due to a positive impact that was
smaller in 2019 than in 2018 (with 68 million euros in 2019 compared
with 158 million euros in 2018).

On a comparable basis __, the 4 million euros increase in adjusted
EBITDA in France between 2018 and 2019 was mainly attributable to:

—(i) the reduction in commercial charges and equipment costs mainly
the costs of terminal and other equipment sold, notably connected
with the marked slowdown in equipment sales, (ii) the fall in labor
expenses connected with the reduction in average number of
employees (full-time equivalents) and (iii) by the reduction in taxes
and operating charges;

—partially offset (i) by the growth in other external purchases due to
the increase in purchases for resale relating to the operation of

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 198 million euros increase in adjusted
EBITDA in France between 2017 and 2018 reflects (i) the negative
impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes
for 1 million euros, and (ii) is more than offset by the organic change on
acomparable basis, i.e. a 197 million euros increase in adjusted EBITDA.

Between 2017 and 2018, adjusted EBITDA benefited from the positive
111 million euros effect of the inclusion of e -reader offers, due to a
positive effect that was larger in 2018 than in 2017 (at 158 million euros
in 2018, compared to 47 million euros in 2017).

Ona comparable basis __, the 197 million euros increase in adjusted
EBITDA in France between 2017 and 2018 was mainly attributable to:

—(i) 163 million euros in revenue growth, (ii) the fall in labor expenses,
resulting primarily from the lower average number of employees
(fulltime equivalents) thanks to the ongoing transformation plans,
and (iii) to a lesser extent, the decrease in other operating expenses
and the reduction in commercial expenses and content costs;

—partially offset by (i) the increase in other external purchases, largely
due to purchases for resale related to the operation of networks
managed by local authorities, and (ii) the reduction in other operating
income.

3.1.3.1.3 Operating income — France

2019 vs 2018

On a historical basis, the 694 million euros decrease in operating
income in France between 2018 and 2019 was largely attributable to:

——582 million euros in specific labor expenses, largely due to the
negative effect of the recognition of a 614 million expense in 2018
for Part-Time for Seniors plans (TPS, relating to agreements on
the employment of senior workers in France) and related bonuses
(see Notes 1.8 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements), The
expense recorded in 2018 mainly relates to the effect of extending
the 2015 Frenchpart -time for seniors plans (TPS) for three additional
years;

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

—a decrease of 69 million euros in the cost of restructuring programs;

—and by the 64 million euros increase connected to the combined
effect of (i) the rise in EBITDAaL on a comparable basis (4 million
euros), and (ii) the positive effects on EBITDAaL of foreign exchange
fluctuations and other changes (60 million euros);

—partly offset by the 31 million euros increase in depreciation and
amortization of fixed assets mainly due to increased investment in
recent years in the roll out of very high -speed networks (fiber optic
and 4G).

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 170 million euros decrease in operating
income in France between 2017 and 2018 was largely attributable to:

—(i) the 307 million euros increase in specific labor expenses, primarily
for the Part- Time for Seniors (TPS) plan (relating to agreements
on the employment of older workers in France) and related bonuses,
particularly with the three- year extension of the plan in
December 2018, (ii) the 102 million euros increase in restructuring
and integration costs, and (iii) the 75 million euros increase in
depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, mainly linked to the
increase in investments made in recent years (including the rollout
of fiber);

—partially offset by (i) the 198 million euros increase in adjusted
EBITDA, and (ii) the counter-effect of the recognition in 2017 of a
115 million euros charge for significant litigation.

3.1.3.1.4 Economic CAPEX (CAPEX until

operational and performance indicators for an amount of | million
euros.

Ona comparable basis __, the 397 million euros increase in economic
CAPEX< in France between 2018 and 2019 is largely attributable to
increased investment in very high -speed (fiber optics, which is
co-financed by other operators), mainly connected to the production

of Oranges fiber network and the accelerated deployment of Public
Initiative Networks (PIN, see Section 1.3 Significant Events). At
December 31, 2019, France thus had 16.3 million households with
very high-speed broadband connectivity, (up 38.0% year-on-year).

2019 vs 2018 —and the 51 million euros decrease in the revenue from Convergent

On a historical basis, the 69 million euros reduction in revenue in
Spain between 2018 and 2019 (i) includes the favorable impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes amounting

to 11 million euros, resulting mainly from the acquisition of Republica
De Communicaciones Moviles on November 7, 2018, and (ii) organic
change onacomparable basis representing a 80 million euros decrease

in revenue.

On a comparable basis __, the 80 million euros decrease in revenue
from Spain between 2018 and 2019 is mainly explained by (i) the
decrease in Mobile only services, the contraction in Equipment sales,
and the fall in convergent services, partially offset by an increase in
Wholesale and to a lesser extent by the increased revenue from Fixed
only services and IT & Integration Services.

On a comparable basis, between 2018 and 2019, the commercial
results of fixed bandwidth and mobile suffered from the competitive
environment in Spain:

—the total mobile customer base increased by 0.8% year -on-year
with 16.3 million customers on December 31, 2019. Contract
customers increased by 2.0% year -on-year whilst prepaid
customers (2.6 million customers on December 31, 2019) fell by
5.1% year -on-year. Furthermore the 4G customer totaled | 1 million

customers on December 31, 2019 a 12.9% increase year -on-year;

—the total fixed high -speed broadband customer base drops by
1.9% year -on-year mainly due to the fall in the convergent customer
base. The very high speed fixed broadband customer base
continues to progress with 11.0% growth year —_-on-year, and totaled
3.2 million customers on December 31, 2019. In addition, digital
telephone television offers grew by 0.3% year on year driven by
content offers, (especially transmissions of soccer championships
and optional premium contents see Section 1.3 Significant events) .

Ona comparable basis __, the 80 million euros reduction in revenue in
Spain between the two periods i.e. a reduction of 1.5% is mainly
attributable to:

—the 70 million euros decrease inrevenue from Mobile only services ,
Is due to the markets slide towards low __-cost offers engendering a
fall of 3.4% in Mobile only ARPO over 12 months between

December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019;

—the 65 million euros decreasein Equipmentsales , due to the decline
in volumes and trading down on terminals sold;

services , connected to the 3.8% fall in the convergent customer
base year -on-year and a difficult competitive environment. The
12-month convergent ARPO was stable between December 31,
2018 and December 31, 2019;

—partially offset by:

— the 96 million euros increase in the revenue of Wholesale, driven
mainly by the growth in international traffic,

— and to a lesser extent by the increase in revenue of — Fixed only
services and integration and information technology services ,
notably due to the increase in infrastructure management solution
offers and security offers.

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 118 million euros increase in revenue in
Spain between 2017 and 2018 stems from (i) the positive impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes amounting

to 1 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis
representing a 117 million euros increase in revenue.

Ona comparable basis __, the 117 million euros increase in revenue in
Spain between 2017 and 2018 is largely attributable to (i) the growth
in revenue from convergent services, (ii) the growth in revenue from
fixed wholesale, and (iii) to a lesser extent, the increase in revenue from
equipment sales.

On a comparable basis, Spains mobile and fixed customer bases
have withstood strong competition:

—the total mobile customer base stood at 16.2 million customers at
December 31, 2018, up 1.8% from December 31, 2017. Offers with
contracts totaled 13.5 million customers at December 31, 2018, up
2.3% year -on-year, whereas prepaid offers (amounting to 2.7 million
customers at December 31, 2018) recorded a 5.7% decline over
the same period. The number of 4G customers reached 9.8 million
at December 31, 2018, an increase of 4.7% year -on-year;

—the total fixed broadband customer base totaled 4.1 million
customers at December 31, 2018. The very high _—-speed fixed
broadband customer base grew significantly, up 27.6% year -on-year
to stand at 2.9 million customers at December 31, 2018. At
December 31, 2018, digital television offers also grew by 14.5%
year-on-year. This was driven by content offers, with a TV penetration
rate of more than 17%.

Ona comparable basis __, the 117 million euros increase in revenue for
Spain between the two periods is mainly attributable to:
—the 65 million euros increase in revenue from Convergent services
which notably results from (i) the continued enhancement of
convergent offers and the increase in (ii) the increase in the
corresponding, customer base which reaches 3.1 million customers
on December 31 2018 up by 1.1% year  -on-year. In parallel,
12-monthconvergent ARPO rose by 1.3% year-on-year. Convergence
offers now represent 84.7% of the retail fixed broadband customer
base at December 31, 2018;

—the 56 million euros increase in revenue from Wholesale, driven by
(i) the development of very high -speed broadband access and
national roaming, partially offset by the decline in incoming mobile
traffic (impact of the cuts in call termination rates since February 2018);

— And toa lesser extent by the 15 millioneurosincreasein = Equipment
sales , because of the improvement in loT commercial activity (smart
security);

—partially offset by the 16 million euros reduction in Mobile only
services essentially caused by the fall in revenue from prepaid offers,
(due to the 5.7% contraction year-on-year in the number of prepaid
customers). However, mobile only ARPO grew by 0.8% for the
12 months to December 31, 2018, while the mobile only customer
base grew by 0.4% year -on-year.

3.1.3.2.2 EBITDAaL (EBITDA adjusted until

December 31, 2018) — Spain

2019 vs 2018
In 2019, Spains EBITDAaL totals 1,646 million euros.

Between 2018 and 2019, EBITDAaL in Spain includes (i) the negative
effect of applying the IFRS 16 standard and a change in operational
performance indicators for an amount of 63 million euros, and (ii) the
positive effect of changes to the scope of consolidation and other
changes for 5 million euros.

Ona comparable basis __, the 4 million euros increase between 2018
and 2019 mainly results from:

—the reduction in commercial charges and equipment costs (reduction
in the costs of terminals and other equipment sold, as well as
distribution commissions, connected with the slowdown in
equipment sales), the increase in other operating income, the fall in
network charges and the reduction in other external purchases;

—partially offset by (i) the increase in content costs, connected to a
large extent to the increase in soccer rights (see Section 1.3
Significant events) , the 80 million euros decrease in sales revenue
and the rise in interconnection charges.

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis , the 133 million euros increase in adjusted
EBITDA in Spain between 2017 and 2018 can be attributed to (i) the
positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other
changes of | million euros, and (ii) organic growth on a comparable
basis amounting to an increase of 132 million euros in adjusted
EBITDA.

Ona comparable basis __, the 132 million euros increase in adjusted
EBITDA in Spain between 2017 and 2018 mainly resulted from (i) the
117 million euros increase in revenue, (ii) the increase in other operating
income, (iii) the positive effect of fixed asset disposals in 2018 and (iv)
the decline in service fees and inter -operator costs (with a fall in
national mobile termination rates in February 2018), (v) partly offset by
the increase in content costs, primarily due to soccer rights and offer
enhancement, in line with the commercial momentum.

3.1.3.2.3 Operating income — Spain

2019 vs 2018

Ona historical basis _, the increase of 71 million euros in the operating
income for Spain between 2018 and 2019 is mainly explained by:

—the counter -effect from recognizing a 31 million euros charge for
significant litigation in 2018;

—the 29 million euros decrease in depreciation and amortization of
fixed assets mainly due to the reduction in depreciation for the
mobile network relating to the fall in the investments made;

—the increase of 21 million euros in the income from disposals of fixed
assets, investments and businesses, because of the increase in
proceeds from disposals of fixed assets mainly due to selling
non -strategic mobile sites.

2018 vs 2017

Ona historical basis __, the stability of Spain s operating income between
2017 and 2018 mainly stems from the 133 million euros increase in
adjusted EBITDA, largely offset by (i) the 97 million euros increase in
depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, essentially owing to
increased investment in recent years as part of the deployment of very
high- speed broadband networks (4G and fiber) and the increased
depreciation of leased handsets, | Livebox, and equipment installed on
customer premises, and (ii) the recognition, in the first half of 2018, of
a 31 million euros charge relating to significant litigation.
3.1.3.2.4 Economic CAPEX (CAPEX until
December 31, 2018) — Spain

2019 vs 2018
In 2019, Economic CAPEX in Spain totaled 812 million euros.

Between 2018 and 2019, economic CAPEX in Spain includes (i) the
negative effect of applying the IFRS 16 and a change in operational
performance indicators for an amount of 53 million euros, and (ii) the
positive effect of changes to the scope of consolidation and other
changes for | million euros

Ona comparable basis __, the 256 million euros reduction in economic
CAPEX in Spain between 2018 and 2019 mainly results from the (i)
the increase in disposals of fixed assets due to the sale of non -strategic
mobile sites to Cellnex in December 2019 for 185 million euros (see
Section 1.3 Significant events) , (ii) lower investment in very high speed
broadband networks (less deployment and network sharing), (iii) the
reduction in economic CAPEX in relation to leased handsets, Liveboxes
and the equipment installed on customers premises (iv) partially offset

by the increased investment in IT (application developments) and
customer service platforms to support the digital transformation.

2018 vs 2017

On both a historical basis anda comparable basis __, the 5 million
euros increase in CAPEX in Spain between 2017 and 2018 was largely
attributable to increased investment in information systems and service
platforms, offset by co- financing received from other carriers in very

high-speed broadband networks.

2019 vs 2018

On a historical basis, the 95 million euros increase in revenue for
Europe between 2018 and 2019 includes (i) the favorable impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 35 million
euros, mainly resulting from the acquisition of BlueSoft in Poland on
June 12, 2019 and BKM in Belgium on July 30, 2019 and, (ii) the
negative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations for 21 million euros,
and (iii) the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase of
81 million euros in revenue.

Ona comparable basis __, the 81 million euros increase in revenue in
Europe between 2018 and 2019 Is mainly attributable to:

——(i) the growth in Convergent services, In all countries, and to a lesser
extent, (ii) by the increase in IT & Integration Services in Poland and
Romania, and (iii) by the increase in Equipment sales and (iv) the
growth in Other revenue in Poland;

—partially offset partially offset by (i) the decrease in Wholesale, In all
countries, and (ii) by the decrease in Mobile only services and Fixed
only services, mainly in Poland.

On a comparable basis, Europes customer bases grew between
2018 and 2019:

—the total mobile customer base grew by 2.6% year —_ -on-year, mainly
in Belgium and Poland, and totals 34.6 million customers at

December 31, 2019;

—the total fixed customer base increased by 6.5% year -on-year, with
a total 3.5 million customers at December 31, 2019 driven by the
rollout of fiber, with its customers increasing by 36.3% year-on-year.

the 158 million euros increase in revenue
in Europe between the two periods was

On a comparable basis
from convergent services
mainly attributable to:

—the 20.0% increase in the convergent customer base year
due to attractive convergent offers and the migration of customers

-on-year

towards them in almost all countries. Convergence customers now
represent 56.7% of Europe s retail fixed broadband customer base
at December 31, 2019. The number of convergent mobile customers
also increased by 18.6% year -on-year;

—and a growth in value. The 12 -month convergent ARPO therefore
increased in Poland, Belgium and Romania between December 31,
2018 and December 31, 2019.

This strong growth in the revenue of convergent services between
these two periods is also associated, to a lesser extent, with (i) an
increase of 39 million eurosin IT & Integration Services revenue mainly
in Poland on the enterprise market, (ii) an increase of 33 million euros

in Equipment sales year on year mainly in Poland and Belgium and (iii)
growth of 22 million euros in Other revenue , driven to a large extent
by the expansion in energy offers in Poland.

This growth was partially offset by:

—the 74 million euros decrease in revenue from Wholesale , mainly
caused by reduced revenue from mobile services to carriers in all
countries connected to the decline in the activity relating to virtual
mobile network operators (MVNO) In Belgium and the fall in call
termination in Romania;

—the 50 million euros reduction in revenue from Fixed only services
and by the 47 million euros decrease in revenue from Mobile only
services , mainly caused by customers migrating to convergent
offers.

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis the 109 million euros increase in revenue in
Spain between 2017 and 2018 stems from (i) the positive impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation of 4 million euros and other
changes amounting to 11 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a
comparable basis representing a 94 million euros increase in revenue.

Financial Report

Analysis of the Group s financial position and earnings

Ona comparable basis __, the 94 million euros increase in revenue from
Europe between 2017 and 2018 was mainly due to (i) the growth in
Convergent services (Poland, Belgium and Romania), and to a lesser
extent (ii) the increase in Integration and IT services, (iii) the growth in
Equipment Sales, and (iv) the growth in Wholesale (mainly in Poland),
(v) partially offset by the decline in Mobile only services and Fixed only
services (mainly in Poland) and the decrease in Other revenue.

On a comparable basis, the change in mobile and fixed customer
bases in Europe between 2017 and 2018 mainly reflects the good
progress made in mobile and fixed customer bases in Poland, Belgium
and Luxembourg:

—the total mobile customer base was 33.8 million customers at
December 31, 2018, up 1.6% year _-on-year, in line with the increase
in the mobile customer bases in Belgium and Poland. The growth
in contract offers (up 3.3% year -on-year) is driven by the growth in
convergent offers, particularly with the Love offers in Poland and
Belgium. The number of 4G customers reached 14.8 million at

December 31, 2018, up 22.3% year -on-year;

—the fixed broadband customer base reached 3.3 million at
December 31, 2018, up 10.5% year -on-year, due to the strong
growth in the very high -speed broadband customer base in all
European countries. This increase was mainly driven by (i) the
development of very high -speed broadband offers, particularly cable
offers in Belgium, and (ii) by convergent offers that continue to grow
with 382,000 new customers in one year, mainly in Poland and
Romania. Moreover, 1.8 million customers had subscribed to IPTV

and satellite TV offers at December 31,2018, up 17.9% year-on-year.

Ona comparable basis _ the 163 million eurosincreasein Convergent
services between the two periods is mainly due to the migration of
customers to convergent offers in most European countries. The
convergent customer base grew by 30.3% year — -on-year (mainly in
Poland, Belgium and Romania) and stood at 1.6 million customers at
December 31, 2018. Convergent customers now make up 50.3% of

the consumer fixed broadband customer base at December 31,2018,

up 7,6 points year -on-year.

To a lesser extent, the increased revenue off countries in Europe
between the two periods was also caused by:

—the 29 million euros increase in IT and integration services , was
largely related to the enterprise market in Poland;

—the 21 million euros increase in Equipment sales , driven by the
growth in mobile equipment sales based mainly in Romania due to
the increased penetration of smartphones;

—and the 17 million euros increase in revenue for = Wholesale was
largely related to (i) the growth in national roaming (Poland, Slovakia),
the growth in visitor roaming (Belgium, Romania) and the increase
in incoming mobile traffic in Poland, (ii) partially offset by the decline

in virtual mobile network operators (MVNO) in Belgium.

These favorable developments are partially offset between the two
periods:

—by the 60 million euros decrease in Fixed only services revenue
(stemming for the most part from Poland) mainly resulting from (i)
by the downward trend in fixed -line telephony revenue in Poland
and (ii) customer migration towards convergent offers, which was

very marked in Poland;

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

—by the 58 million euros decline in Mobile only services , reflecting the
0.7% fall in the mobile only customer base, which is mainly due to
the migration of customers towards convergent offers in almost all
countries, and especially in Poland;

—and by the 18 million euros decrease in Other revenue mainly in
Belgium and to a lesser extent in Poland despite the development
of energy offers.
3.1.3.3.2 EBITDAaL (EBITDA adjusted until
December 31, 2018) — Europe

2019 vs 2018

in 2019, the EBITDAaL of the Europe countries totaled 1,492 million
euros.

Between 2018 and 2019, the EBITDAaL of the Europe countries
includes (i) the negative effects of IFRS 16 standard and a change in
operational performance indicators for an amount of 63 million euros,
(ii) the negative effects of foreign exchange fluctuations of 5 million
euros and (iii) the positive effect of changes in the scope of consolidation
and other changes of 2 million euros.

Ona comparable basis __, the 49 million euros increase in the EBITDAaL
in the Europe countries between 2018 and 2019 is mainly attributable to:

—(i) the 81 million euros increase in revenue, (ii) the fall in interconnection
charges, associated with the decline in Wholesale, (iii) the decrease
in distribution commissions mainly in Poland due to lower volumes
and to a lesser extent in Belgium following the revision of the sales
policy and (iv) by the increase in other operating income;

—partially offset (i) by the increase in other external purchases mainly
in Poland due to the expansion in IT & Integration Services and the
growth of energy sales, (ii) by the increased cost of content across
all countries (see Section 1.3 Significant events) , and (iii) by the
increased costs of terminals and other equipment sold, especially
in Poland and Belgium connected with increased equipment sales.

2018 vs 2017

Ona historical basis, the 52 million euros increase in adjusted EBITDA
in Europe countries between 2017 and 2018 is explained by (1) foreign
exchange gains of 2 million euros, (ii) the favorable effect of changes
in the scope of consolidation and other changes in the amount of

2 million euros, and (iii) by organic change on a comparable basis, i.e.

a 48 million euros increase in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis __, the 48 million euros increase in adjusted
EBITDA for Europe between 2017 and 2018 can essentially be
attributed to:

—(i) the 94 million euros increase in revenue, (ii) gains on the disposal
of fixed assets, mainly in Poland, In particular the disposals in 2018
within the scope of the optimization of the real estate portfolio, (iii)
the reduction in commercial expenses, and equipment costs, mainly
in Poland and (iv) the decrease in labor expenses, mainly in Poland;

—partially offset by (i) the increase in content costs, (ii) the increase in
network charges, corresponding mainly to the increase in network
access connection charges in Belgium, in line with the increase in
the customer base for cable offers in the country, and (iii) expenses
related to the development of energy sales in Poland.
3.1.3.3.3 Operating income — Europe

2019 vs 2018

Ona historical basis _, the increase of 43 million euros in the operating
income for the countries of Europe between 2018 and 2019 is mainly
explained by:

—the 46 million euros increase as a result of the combined effect of
(i) the rise in EBITDAaL on a comparable basis (49 million euros), as
well as (ii) the positive effects on EBITDAaL of changes in the
consolidation and other changes (2 million euros) and (iii) the
unfavorable effects of foreign exchange fluctuations (5 million euros);

—the 45 million euros reduction in depreciation and amortization of
fixed assets mainly in Poland;

—and by the increase of 19 million euros in the income from disposals
of fixed assets, investments and businesses, related to the increased
income from disposals of fixed assets mainly connected with real
estate optimization programs in Poland;

—partially offset by the 49 million euros increase in the restructuring
program costs mainly due to departure plans for employees in
Poland in 2019 (see Note 5.3 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements).

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 99 million euros improvement in operating
income in Europe between 2017 and 2018 was mainly attributable to

(i) the 52 million euros increase in adjusted EBITDA, (ii) the 33 million
euros decrease in restructuring and integration costs and (iii) the
counter -effect of the recognition, in 2017, of 19 million euros in
impairment of goodwill relating to Luxembourg, and mainly reflecting
strong competitive pressure.

3.1.3.3.4 Economic CAPEX (CAPEX until

December 31, 2018) — Europe

2019 vs 2018
In 2019, economic CAPEX in Europe totaled 869 million euros.

Between 2018 and 2019, the economic CAPEX in Europe includes (i)
the negative effects of the application of the IFRS 16 standard and a
change in operational performance indicators for an amount of
59 million euros, and (ii) the unfavorable effects of changes in the
scope of consolidation and other changes for 7 million euros and the
negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, i.e. 4 million euros

Ona comparable basis __, the 15 million euros decrease in economic
CAPEX in Europe between 2018 and 2019 Is mainly explained by the
reduction in economic CAPEX in Poland because of the increase in
disposals of real estate within the scope of the real estate optimization
program partially offset by the increase in economic CAPEX in central
European countries especially Romania due to the rollout of fiber optic.

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, | the 56 million euros increase in revenue in
CAPEX in Europe between 2017 and 2018 is explained by (i) foreign
exchange gains of | million euros, (ii) the favorable effects of changes
in the scope of consolidation and other changes amounting to | million
euros, and (iii) organic change on a comparable basis representing a
54 million euros increase in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 54 million euros increase in CAPEX in
Europe between 2017 and 2018 Is explained by the continued
investment in mobile and fixed very high speed broadband networks
(4G and FTTH), particularly in Poland.

3.1.3.3.5 Acquisitions of telecommunication

licenses — Europe

Acquisitions of telecommunication licenses in Europe amounted (i) in
2019, to 9 million euros, for Slovakia and (ii) in 2018, to 10 million euros
for data on a historical basis mainly involving Poland. In 2017 no
telecommunications license acquisition was recognized in Europe.

2019 vs 2018

Ona historical basis _, the 456 million euros revenue increase in Africa
& Middle East between 2018 and 2019 included (i) the positive impact
of foreign exchange fluctuations of 133 million euros, mainly due to
fluctuations in the Egyptian pound, the Jordanian dinar, and the
Moroccan dirham, against the euro, (ii) the negative effect of changes
in the scope of consolidation and other changes representing 8 million
euros, and (iii) organic change on a comparable basis namely a
331 million euros increase in revenue.

On a comparable basis, — the 331 million euros revenue increase in
Africa & Middle East between 2018 and 2019 is mainly explained by
growth in the business (i) of the Sonatel sub-group, primarily driven by
Guinea, Senegal and Mali, (ii) C ted Ivoire sub-group primarily driven
by Burkina Faso and the C te d Ivoire, (iii) Egypt, (iv) the Congo (DRC)
and (v) to a lesser extent Morocco.

The growth in the revenue of the countries of Africa & Middle East
between the two periods is mainly attributable to:

—the 337 million euros increase in Mobile only services , connected
to a large extent:

— the 25.2% increase in data services which benefits from the
42.6% growth in the 4G customer base with a total of 23.8 million
customers on December 31, 2019,

, 2019 (see Section 1.3

Significant events) .

— and the sustained growth of Orange Money (see Section 1.3
Significant events ), With an increase of 20.1% year -on-year of
the active Customer base, which is growing in all countries and
totals 18.2 million active customers as of December 31, 2019.
Orange Moneys 2019 revenue totals 425 million euros, an
increase of 27.1% Moreover, mobile voice services continue to
grow due to the enhancement of the abundances offers especially
in the countries in the sub Saharan zone;

—and to a lesser extent the increase of 46 million euros in

Fixed only

services , mainly due to the expansion of fiber especially in Morocco,

Jordan and Senegal;

—partially offset by the 54 million euros decrease in

Wholesale , mainly

reflecting the fall in volumes of call termination rates and incoming
international traffic and (ii) to a lesser extent the fall in roaming
revenues connected with the gradual implementation of free roaming
agreements (agreement allowing mobile customers in other
countries to keep their local number without a surcharge, to receive
calls free of charge and to make calls at local rates) in the West

African region.

2018 vs 2017

Ona historical basis,

the 160 million euros revenue increase in Africa

& Middle East between 2017 and 2018 included (i) foreign exchange

Financial Report
Analysis of the Group s financial position and earnings

losses of 90 million euros, mainly due to fluctuations in the Egyptian
pound, the Moroccan dirham, the Jordanian dinar and, to a lesser
extent, the Guinean franc against the euro, (ii) more than offset by the
organic change on a comparable basis, representing a 250 million
euros increase in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 250 million euros revenue increase in
Africa & Middle East countries between the 2017 and 2018 was mainly

due to the increase in revenue generated by (i) the Sonatel sub -group
for 92 million euros (primarily driven by Guinea, Senegal and Mali), (ii)
Egypt for 54 million euros, (iii) the C te dIvoire sub-group (primarily
driven by Burkina Faso) for 39 million euros, (iv) Morocco for 33 million
euros and (v) Congo (DRC) for 29 million euros.

On a comparable basis, revenue growth of 271 million euros in Mobile
only services reflects the commercial momentum of data services and
Orange Money, and the almost stability of outgoing voice services,
due notably to the development of abundance offers. Revenue for
Orange Money services amounted to 334 million euros as of
December 31, 2018, up 39.8% year -on-year in line with the 25.3%
increase in the Orange Money active customer base (15.1 million
customers at December 31, 2018). The total customer base of Orange
Money stood at 39.2 million customers at December 31, 2018. The
mobile only customer base totaled 120.6 million customers at
December 31, 2018, down 0.7% compared to December 31, 2017.
Between the two periods, the growth in the mobile only customer base

in Africa and Middle East countries (excluding Egypt) was more than
offset by the decline in the mobile only customer base in Egypt,
resulting from the change in regulations in the country (related notably

to the impact of the change in the indirect distribution regulatory
framework).

On a comparable basis, the 13 million euros increase in revenue for
Fixed only services between the two periods, was mainly due to
revenue growth posted by fixed only broadband services in Morocco,
offsetting the decrease in voice usage, for the C te d Ivoire sub -group
and Jordan in particular.

On acomparable basis, the 67 million euros reduction in revenue from
Wholesale between the two periods principally reflected the reduction
in services to international carriers and incoming mobile traffic,
particularly for the Sonatel sub-group.
3.1.3.4.2 EBITDAaL (adjusted EBITDA to

December 31, 2018) — Africa & Middle East

2019 vs 2018

In 2019, the EBITDAaL in Africa & Middle East totaled 1,815 million
euros.

Between 2018 and 2019, the EBITDAaL of the Europe countries
includes (i) the negative effects of the IFRS 16 standard and a change
in operational performance indicators for an amount of 50 million
euros, (ii) the positive effects of foreign exchange fluctuations of
43 million euros and (iii) the negative effects of changes in the scope
of consolidation and other changes of | million euros.

Ona comparable basis __, the 157 million euros increase in EBITDAaL
in Africa & Middle East between 2018 and 2019 is primarily explained
by:

—the 331 million euros growth in revenue, and to a lesser extent the
fall in service fees and inter -operator costs, the fall in incoming
volumes and the reduction in call termination rates in some countries
in the zone;

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

—partially offset (i) by the increase in operating taxes and levies
payable due to the growth in the activity and the counter _- effect of
the recognition of the reversal of provisions to extinguish tax risks
in 2018, (ii) by the increase in commercial expenses and the cost
of equipment notably connected with the growth in the Orange
Money activity and, to a lesser extent, (iii) the increase in labor
expenses and (iv) the rise in the networks other expenses and IT
expenses connected to the deployment of the network and
overheads).

2018 vs 2017

Ona historical basis _, the 55 million euros increase in adjusted EBITDA
in Africa & Middle East between 2017 and 2018 included (i) foreign
exchange losses of 24 million euros and the unfavorable impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 3 million
euros, (ii) more than offset by organic change on a comparable basis,
representing an 82 million euros increase in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, — the 82 million euros increase in adjusted
EBITDA in Africa & Middle East between 2017 and 2018 was largely
attributable to:

—(i) 250 million euros in revenue growth, (ii) the fall in service fees and
inter-operator costs, and (iii) the reduction in operating taxes and
levies due to reversals on provisions for the extinction of tax risks
in 2018;

—partially offset (i) by the growth in other network expenses and IT
expenses (primarily due to the increase in work on mobile sites,
particularly the deployment of 4G sites) (ii) the increase in commercial
expenses (related in particular to the growth of Orange Money), (iii)
increased labor expenses, and (iv) the growth of other external
purchases (property expenses due to the development of the
network and overheads).

3.1.3.4.3 Operating income — Africa & Middle East

2019 vs 2018

On a historical basis , the 280 million euros increase in operating
income in Africa & Middle East between 2018 and 2019 was largely
attributable to:

—the 198 million euros increase connected to the combined effect of
(i) the increase in EBITDAaL on a comparable basis (157 million
euros), (ii) the positive effects of foreign exchange fluctuations
(43 million euros), and (iii) the negative impact of changes to the
scope of consolidation and other changes (1 million euros);

—and by the 135 million euros improvement in impairment losses on
fixed assets (see Notes 7 and 8.3 to the consolidated financial
statements), due to the recognition of:

— an 89 million euros provision reversal on fixed assets in Egypt in
2019 reflecting the country s improved economic situation,

— a 46 million euros impairment in 2018, primarily for Niger for
43 million euros. In Niger, the telecoms market sustained a loss
in value in a difficult business environment. The Company s
economic and financial situation has led it, as a precaution, to
recognize a fixed -asset impairment to cover Oranges exposure
according to the best current estimate;

—partly offset by the 66 million euros increase in depreciation and
amortization of fixed assets mainly due to the roll out of mobile
networks and the amortization of new 4G licenses.
2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 137 million euros increase in operating
income in Africa & Middle East between 2017 and 2018 was largely
attributable to:

—a 79 million euros reduction in impairment losses on goodwill and
fixed assets (see Notes 7 and 8.3 to the consolidated financial
statements), mainly due to the recognition of:

— in 2018, (i) impairment loss on goodwill of 56 million euros on
Jordan, and (ii) impairment loss on fixed assets for 43 million
euros on Niger. In Jordan, the goodwill impairment mainly reflects
the effects of an uncertain political and economic climate and
strong competitive pressure on fixed and mobile data markets.

In Niger, the telecoms market sustained a loss of value ina difficult
business environment. The Companys economic and financial
position led it, as a precaution, to recognize a fixed = -asset
impairment to cover Oranges exposure according to the best
current estimate,

— 181 million euros in impairment in 2017, primarily for the
Democratic Republic of the Congo for 120 million euros and
Niger for 52 million euros. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), the impairment loss reflected a still -uncertain political and
economic context, a clear decline in purchasing power, with its
effects on consumption of telecommunications products and
services, and continued regulatory pressure. In Niger, the
impairment loss reflected an uncertain political and economic
context and the effects of strong tax and regulatory pressure;

—and the 55 million euros increase in adjusted EBITDA.

3.1.3.4.4 Economic CAPEX (CAPEX until

December 31, 2018) — Africa & Middle East

2019 vs 2018

increased cost of terminals and other sold production notably due
to the increase in IT and integration services and (iii) the increase in
other network expenses and IT expenses, due to the growth in the

—partially offset by (i) the 75 million euros increase in revenue, (ii) the
fall in other operating expenses (net of other operating income) and
(iii) by the reduction in other external purchases.

of (i) the increase in EBITDAaL on a comparable basis (21 million
euros), (ii) negative impact of changes to the scope of
consolidation and other changes (27 million euros) and (iii) the
positive effects of foreign exchange fluctuations (23 million euros),

changes for 11 million euros, and (ii) the favorable impact of exchange
rate fluctuations, i.e. 3 million euros.

activity, and by the increased network investments made.

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 29 million euros decrease in Enterprise
CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 is reflected (i) by the 5 million euros
adverse impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, more than offset by

other changes for 8 million euros and (ii) the organic change on a
comparable basis, namely a 32 million euros reduction in CAPEX.

for 91 million euros, and (ii) the positive impact of changes in the scope
of consolidation and other changes for 7 million euros.

Ona comparable basis, _ the 91 million euros decrease in the economic
CAPEX of International Carriers & Shared Services between 2018 and
2019 mainly resulted from the rise in disposals of fixed assets within
the scope of the real estate optimization program.

2018 vs 2017

On both a historical basis anda comparable basis __, the 34 million
euros increase in CAPEX for International Carriers & Shared Services
between 2017 and 2018 was mainly due to (i) the increase in
investments in real estate projects (in line with the adaptation and
modernization of the real estate portfolio) and (ii) by the investments

in submarine cables, with in particular the Kanawa cable that connects

French Guyana, Martinique and Guadeloupe.
3.1.3.7 Orange Bank

Orange Bank continued to develop its mobile financial services, with
(i) the launch of its Visa Premium card in March 2019 and the
introduction of cashback (refund of a portion of the initial purchase
price of certain purchases to purchasers) beginning in July 2019, and
(ii) with the launch of the banking offer in Spain in November 2019 (see
Section 1.3 Significant events) .

3.1.3.7.1 Operating activities

Segment information for Orange Bank (operating income, investments
in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) is presented
in Notes 1.2 and 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements.

2019 vs 2018

On a historical basis, the 17 million euros deterioration in Orange
Banks operating income between 2018 and 2019 was mainly

attributable to:

—the increase in operating expenses, resulting from the development
of the Orange Bank in Spain partially offset by the reduction in
operating expenses connected to the activity in France;

—the drop in Net banking income (NBI, see Note 1.2 to the
consolidated financial statements), notably due to a review of the
value of the securities portfolio, despite the increase in the NBI of
the Orange Bank offer launched in France in 2017;

—and by the increase in the cost of bank credit risk.
Orange Banks economic CAPEX totaled 28 million euros in 2019.

Ona comparable basis _ , Orange Bank s economic CAPEX decreased
by 8 million euros between 2018 and 2019 mainly due to the decreased
investment in France, which was partially offset by the increased
investment in Spain within the scope of launching the banking offer in
this country (see Section 1.3 Significant events) .

2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 76 million euros deterioration in Orange
Banks operating income between 2017 and 2018 was mainly
attributable to:

—the decrease in Net Banking Income (NBI) mainly due (i) to the costs
of acquiring new customers related to the increase in the volume
of accounts produced during the fiscal year and (ii) the decrease in
NBI from cash transactions;

—and the increase in operating expenses, resulting from the recent
launch of the Orange Bank offering (IT maintenance and
development, hiring, depreciation and amortization of the new
investments, etc. );

—partially offset by the counter -effect of the recognition of a loss of
27 million euros in 2017 due to the Groupama Bank (now Orange
Bank) takeover in 2016.

On a historical basis _, the 25 million euros decrease in Orange Bank
CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 reflects the | million euros adverse
impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes
and by the organic change on a comparable basis, namely a 24 million
euros reduction in CAPEX.

Ona comparable basis __, the decrease of 24 million euros in Orange
Bank CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 resulted mainly from lower
investments in 2018, as fiscal year 2017 had concentrated most of
the investments dedicated to the launch of the new bank offering.

3.1.3.7.2 Assets, liabilities and cash flows

The segment information pertaining to Orange Bank (operating income,
investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets,
assets, liabilities and cash flows) are presented in Note | to the
consolidated financial statements, and Orange Banks activities
(financial assets and liabilities, management of market risks connected
with the activities, and unrecognized contractual commitments) are
described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Outstanding loans and receivables to customers as of December 31,

2019 came to 1.9 billion euros, a decrease of 63 million euros compared
to December 31, 2018 due to the progressive extinction of business
and corporate loans. Retail loans made up 90.1% of that total. 44.9%
were consumer loans (see Note 16.1.1 to the consolidated financial
statements).

Outstanding payables to customers (deposits and savings) as of
December 31, 2018 totaled 3.4 billion euros, a reduction of 39 million
euros compared to December 31, 2018. This was composed mainly
of retail deposits, which were down primarily in response to the end
of sales of Elancio financial products. Institutional investors deposits
made up less than half of the total (see Note 16.1.2 to the consolidated
financial statements).

Between 2017 and 2018, the 230 million euros decrease in net cash
generated by telecoms activities was largely attributable to:

—the 344 million euros increase in current tax expense paid, mainly
in France, primarily due to (i) counter -effects of the 3% tax on
dividends in 2017, and particularly the repayment of 304 million
euros by the French tax authorities in 2017 in relation to the dispute
regarding this tax (see Note 10.2 to the consolidated financial
statements), and (ii) the increase in down payments during the year
due to the exhaustion of tax losses carryforwards in 2018, and (iii)
partly offset by the counter -effect of the implementation of the
exceptional surtax applicable to 2017 (see Note 10.2 to the
consolidated financial statements);

—the 281 million euros change in working capital, largely resulting
from (i) a less pronounced increase in trade payables on other
goods and services in 2018 than in 2017, and (ii) a larger increase
in gross inventories in 2018 than in 2017;

—partly offset by (i) a 200 million euros increase in reported EBITDA,
and (ii) by the 155 million euros decrease in operating taxes and
levies paid.

3.1.4.1.3 Net cash used in investing activities

(telecoms activities)

to a negative 9,707 million euros in 2019 as against a negative
8,426 million euros in 2018, and a negative 7,962 million euros in
2017.

2019 vs 2018

Between 2018 and 2019, the 1,281 million euros increase in net cash
used in investing activities of telecoms activities was largely attributable
to:

—the 1,581 euros increase in investments and other financial assets,
primarily related to cash received when bonds were issued in 2019
(see Note 12.5 to the consolidated financial statements);

—and by the 219 million euros increase in acquisitions of investment
securities (net of cash acquired), owing mainly to the acquisitions
of SecureLink, SecureData, BKM and BlueSoft in 2019 (see
Section 1.3 Significant Events) versus the acquisitions of Basefarm,

2018 vs 2017

Between 2017 and 2018, the 1,335 million euros decrease in net cash

statements);

—and the net change in cash collateral (with an increase of 203 million

Orange s credit rating is an additional performance indicator used to
assess the Groups financial policy and risk management policy and,

the ratings they award. Any change in the rating could produce an
effect on the cost of future financing or restrict access to liquidity.

In addition, a change in Oranges credit rating will, for certain
outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors via
aStep -upclause(Step -up: aclause that triggers an increase in interest
payments in the event of a downgrading of Oranges long —_-term credit
rating by the rating agencies, according to contractually defined
rules — this clause may also stipulate a downward revision of the

In this document, in addition to the financial indicators reported in

accordance withthe IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) ,

Orange publishes financial indicators that are not defined by IFRS. As
described below, these figures are presented as additional information
and are not meant to be substitutes for or to be confused with financial
indicators as defined by IFRS.

Changes in operating performance indicators
used in 2019

Since January 1, 2019, the Group has applied IFRS 16 Leases using
the simplified retrospective method without restatement of comparative
periods (see Note 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements). This
change in accounting standard led the Group to adapt its key
operational performance indicators and to define new ones. Since
January 1, 2019:

—the EBITDAaL indicator (or EBITDA after leases , see Section 3.1.5.2
EBITDAaL yeplaces the adjusted EBITDA indicator: the operational
performance indicator changed as a result of the immediate effects
of the standard, excluding operating lease expenses from the
calculation of this indicator. In order to maintain consistency with
the adjusted EBITDA indicator used in segment information until
December 31, 2018, Orange is using, as of January 1, 2019, the
EBITDAaL indicator, which includes depreciation and amortization
of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in its calculation.
Moreover, owing to changes to the resource allocation indicator,
and in order to ensure the continued relevance of the EBITDAaL —

280 million euros in 2018, and 282 million euros in 2017 (see
Note 14.4 to the consolidated financial statements).

In terms of changes to subordinated notes, on December 12, 2019

the Group announced its intention, in accordance with contractual
terms, to exercise its purchase option on February 7, 2020, on the
outstanding 500 million euros in an initial notional tranche of | billion
euros already partially purchased in April 2019. Due to Oranges
commitment to purchase this tranche, it was reclassified as a debt
instrument and as such included in net financial debt as of
December 31, 2019 (see Note 14.4 to the consolidated financial
statements).

Given the issuance of 500 million euros in subordinated notes on
September 19, 2019 as part of its EMTN plan (see Note 14.4 to the
consolidated finan cial statements), as of December 31, 2019, the
Groups outstanding subordinated notes remain unchanged from
December 31, 2018.

Capital management is described in Note 13.7 to the consolidated
financial statements. Changes in equity are described in the
Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity in the
consolidated financial statements, as well as in Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Financial indicators not defined by IFRS

eCAPEX indicator, EBITDAaL excludes proceeds from the sale of
fixed assets (see Notes 3.1 and 8.1 to the consolidated financial
statements);

—the eCAPEX indicator (or Economic CAPEX , see Section 3.1.5.3
eCAPEX) replaces the CAPEX indicator: the resource allocation
indicator has changed to better reflect the asset rotation strategic
choices, associated in particular with sales of fiber optics. eCAPEX
includes the effects of fixed asset disposals and shows the amount
of property, plant and equipment and intangible investments
(excluding telecommunications licenses and excluding financed
assets) net of the proceeds from sales of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets (see Note 8.1 to the consolidated
financial statements);

—the indicator EBITDAaL—eCAPEX (see Section3.1.5.4 EBITDAaL—
eCAPEX)replaces the adjusted EBITDA — CAPEX indicator;

—net financial debt excludes lease liabilities falling within the scope
of application of IFRS 16;

—and the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of telecoms activities
(see Section 3.1.5.7. Ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of
telecoms activities) replaces the ratio of net financial debt to adjusted
EBITDA of telecoms activities.

Nonetheless, adjusted EBITDA, reported EBITDA, CAPEX, the
Adjusted EBITDA — CAPEX indicator and the ratio of net financial
debt to adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities remain the benchmark
indicators for prior periods.
Moreover, in the Engage 2025 Strategic Plan (see Section 1.3 Significant
events) , Orange has used organic cash flow from telecoms activities

as a key operational performance indicator for telecoms activities (see
Section 3.1.5.5 Organic cash flow from telecoms activities)

3.1.5.1

In order to allow investors to track the annual changes in the Group s
operations, data on a comparable basis are presented for the previous
period. The transition from data on a historical basis to data on a
comparable basis consists of keeping the results for the year ended
and restating the previous year in order to present financial data with
comparable methods, scope of consolidation and exchange rates
over comparable periods. Orange provides the details of the effect of
changes in method, scope of consolidation and exchange rates on its
key operating indicators in order to isolate the intrinsic business effect.

Data on a comparable basis

Financial Report
Analysis of the Group s financial position and earnings

The method used is to apply to the data of the corresponding period
of the preceding year the methods and the scope of consolidation for
the period ended, as well as the average exchange rates used for the
Consolidated income statement for the period ended.

Oranges management believes that the presentation of these
indicators on a comparable basis is pertinent, as these are indicators
used internally by the Group for monitoring its operating activities.
Changes in data on a comparable basis better reflect organic business
changes.

Data on a comparable basis are not financial indicators defined by
IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by
other companies. It is provided as additional information only and

Orange s management considers that the presentation of the indicator
EBITDAaL is relevant because, by including lease expenses in its
calculation, this indicator enables better reflection of the operational
performance of operating segments, while retaining consistency with
the adjusted EBITDA indicator used in segment information until
December 31, 2018. This is the operational performance indicator
used internally by the Group since January 1, 2019 to (i) manage and
assess its operating results and segment results, and (ii) implement
its investments and resource allocation strategy. EBITDAaL, or similar

Oranges management considers that presenting economic CAPEX
is relevant because this indicator (i) does not include investments in
telecommunications licenses (the acquisition of these licenses is not
part of the daily monitoring of operating investments) and financed
assets (no effect on cash flow upon acquisition), and (ii) allows, in a
context of asset rotation primarily linked to the fiber -optic economic
model, to measure more accurately the actual amount of investments
by excluding the proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets that have been sold. It is the indicator used
internally by the Group from January 1, 2019 in allocating resources,
in order to measure the operating efficiency of the use of investments
for each of its operating segments.

eCAPEX is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be
comparable to similarly -titled indicators used by other companies. It
is provided as additional information only and should not be considered
as a substitute for purchases of or investments in property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets.

3.1.5.4 EBITDAaL — eCAPEX

Since January 1, 2019, the EBITDAaL — eCAPEX indicator has
replaced the Adjusted EBITDA — CAPEX indicator (see the heading
of Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS) .

The indicator EBITDAaL — eCAPEX is equivalent to | EBITDAaL (see
Section 3.1.5.2 EBITDAaLyninus eCAPEX (see Section 3.1.5.3. eCAPEX)

Oranges management considers that presenting the EBITDAaL —

indicator used internally by the Group from January 1, 2019 to (i)
manage and assess its operating results and segment results, and (ii)
implement its investments and resource allocation strategy.

3.1.5.5 Organic cash flow

from telecoms activities

Organic cash flow from telecoms activities refers to net cash flow
generated by the activity, minus (i) repayments of lease liabilities and
debts related to financial assets, and (ii) purchases and sales of
property plant and equipment and intangible assets, net in the fixed
asset trade payables, (iii) excluding telecommunications licenses paid
and the effect of the main litigations paid (and received).

Financial Report
Analysis of the Group s financial position and earnings

Orange s management believes that the presentation of organic cash
flow from telecoms activities is relevant for measuring the Groups
capacity to free up cash through its telecoms activities taken as a
whole, excluding the main elements which are not under its control
and which may vary from one year to the next, which is the case of
these disbursements (and receipts) relating to the main litigations and
disbursements related to telecommunications license acquisitions. It
is a more comprehensive indicator than EBITDAaL — eCAPEX (used
internally to manage and assess operating and segment results and

to implement its investment and resource allocation strategy), since it
includes the effects of financial costs, income tax and changes in
working capital. It is for this reason that this indicator has been chosen
by Orange for its Engage 2025 Strategic Plan as a key performance
indicator for telecoms activities. This indicator is commonly used by
companies in the telecommunications sector.

Organic cash flow from telecoms activities is not a financial indicator
defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators
used by other companies (see Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not
defined by IFRS). It is not a replacement for cash generated by
operating activities or allocated to investing activities.

3.1.5.6

Net financial debt as defined and used by Orange does not include
Orange Bank activities, for which this conceptis not relevant. It consists
of (i) financial liabilities excluding operating payables (translated into
euros at the year -end closing rate) including derivative instruments
(assets and liabilities), (ii) less cash collateral paid, cash, cash
equivalents and financial assets at fair value. Furthermore, financial
instruments designated as cash flow hedges included in net financial
debt are set up to hedge in particular items that are not included
therein, such as future cash flows. Effects of these hedges are carried

in other comprehensive income. As a consequence, the portion of
these components related to unmatured hedging instruments is added

to gross financial debt to offset this temporary difference.

Net financial debt

Compared to December 31, 2018, net financial debt at December 31,

2019 excludes lease liabilities within the scope of IFRS 16 (see the
heading of Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS and
Note 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements) and includes liabilities

on financed assets.

The breakdown of net financial debt is shown in Note 12.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Net financial debt is an indicator of financial position used by the
Group. Net financial debt is a frequently disclosed indicator. It is widely
used by analysts, investors, rating agencies and most Groups in all
business sectors in Europe.

Net financial debt is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may
not be comparable to similarly -titled indicators used by other
companies. It is provided as additional information only and should
not be considered as a substitute for an analysis of all the Groups
assets and liabilities.

3.1.5.7 Ratio of net financial debt to
EBITDAaL of telecoms activities

Since January 1, 2019, the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of
telecoms activities has replaced the ratio of net financial debt to
adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities (see the heading of
Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS) .

The ratio of net financial debt to the EBITDAaL of telecoms activities
is calculated as the ratio of the Groups net financial debt (see
Section 3.1.5.6 Net financial debt) to the EBITDAaL of telecoms
activities (see Section 3.1.5.2 EBITDAaLyalculated over the previous
12 months. As the net financial debt (as defined and used by Orange)
does not include Orange Bank activities, for which this concept is not
relevant, the net financial debt is divided by the EBITDAaL of telecoms
activities. In addition, when changes in scope significantly affect the
Group s net financial debt at the end of the period, the calculation of
the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of telecoms activities is
adjusted to take into account the EBITDAaL of those entities over the
previous 12 months.

The ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of telecoms activities is
used by Orange to measure the Groups ability to repay its debt, and
more broadly to measure its financial strength. This ratio is commonly
used by companies in the telecommunications sector.

Ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of telecoms activities is not a
financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to
similarly titled indicators used by other companies.

3.1.5.8 Financial indicators used until
December 31, 2018
3.1.5.8.1 Adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA

From January 1, 2019, adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA are no
longer used by the Group. Adjusted EBITDA has been replaced by
EBITDAaL (or EBITDA after leases , see the heading of Section 3.1.5
Financial indicators not defined by IFRS and Section 3.1.5.2 EBITDAaL)

Orange 2019 Universal Registration Document

However, adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA continue to be the
benchmarks for previous reporting periods.

Reported EBITDA, as used until December 31, 2018, is operating
income before depreciation and amortization, before effects resulting
from business combinations, before reclassification of translation
adjustment from liquidated entities, before impairment of goodwill and
fixed assets and before share of profits (losses) of associates and joint
ventures.

Adjusted EBITDA, as used until December 31, 2018, is reported
EBITDA adjusted for the effects of significant litigations, specific labor
expenses, review of the investment and business portfolio, restructuring
and integration costs and, where appropriate, other specific items that

are systematically specified in relation to income and/or expenses (see
Note 1.8 to the consolidated financial statements).

3.2.1

The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting human health, in particular that
of the employees, suppliers, subcontractors and customers of Orange,
as well as the Groups business activities and financial position.

Recent events

On the date of this Universal Registration Document, Orange has
identified the following key points of focus:

business continuity: in countries that have been severely affected
by the pandemic, Orange must, as a provider of services essential
to businesses, ensure the continuity of its electronic communications
services, in particular its critical activities. In accordance with
government requirements, Orange has implemented, in particular
in France, a business continuity plan, which essentially covers
network and information system supervision and operation teams,
security teams, technical support, Data center employees and
field-work teams.

In addition, the significant increase in traffic on Orange networks
runs the risk of congestion, which could lead to a deterioration in
or even the interruption of services. To avoid such deterioration or
interruptions, Orange has strengthened its network capacity and
may decide, if necessary, to prioritize certain services in agreement
with the regulatory authorities.

— human health and safety: Orange is closely monitoring the
developments of the pandemic and is prioritizing the health and
safety of its employees. Orange has appointed a global coordinator
who reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
as well as correspondents in the Groups geographical areas, and
Orange has adapted its activity in the different countries where it
operates to comply with the health guidelines given by each national
authority, while ensuring conditions for business continuity. The
Group has implemented preventive measures by resorting to
teleworking for its employees, whenever the activity can be carried
out remotely and the necessary equipment is available. In the other
cases, Orange has also promoted barrier actions, as soon as

3.2.2 Outlook

Based on the information available on the date of this document,
Orange does not expect a significant deviation from its financial
objectives for the 2020 fiscal year but will closely monitor the situation
and its developments. The important role played by the telecoms
sector during this crisis to ensure the continued functioning of the
economy and society as a whole confirms the strategic character of
Oranges activities. Beyond this, the collective commitment of its
employees, the solidity of its financial situation and the relevance of its
strategic action plans will allow Orange to face the unprecedented
crisis caused by the COVID -19 pandemic.

As a reminder, the objectives announced for 2020 are as follows:
—EBITDAaL (see Section 3.1.5.2 EBITDAaL) flat positive ;

—economic CAPEX (see Section 3.1.5.3. eCAPEX) which includes
the impact of network sharing agreements in Spain and Belgium,
up 200 million euros;

—organic cash flow from telecoms activities (see Section 3.1.5.5
Organic cash flow from telecoms activities) over 2.3 billion euros.

These objectives are based on the assumptions stated in the
presentation of the global digital services market and the Group
strategy (see Section 1.2 Market, strategy and business model) —_ as
well as in the presentation of the Groups operating activities, which

hygiene equipment.

The long-term effects of the containment measures taken by the
public authorities and relayed by the Group are uncertain, especially
the psychological effects that isolation may cause on its employees.

—the consequences of the pandemic on Oranges business and
financial situation are, at this stage, difficult to quantify; however, as
of the publication date of this document, we can note:

— likely effects on revenue, mainly resulting from:

— aslowdown of activities with certain business customers,
— the shutdown of Orange stores,
— a decrease in international roaming;

—_a probable slowdown in investments and related projects,
particularly on the networks,

— _ anincreased risk of default or late payment with some customers,

— uncertainties about the schedule for the launch of 5G in France,
subject to an auction procedure which was to take place from
April 21, 2020, but has been postponed indefinitely due to the
pandemic.

Depending on how the situation develops, there could be other effects
that are not known at this time.

In addition, on March 31, 2020, Orange issued new bonds for a total
notional of 1.5 billionacrosstwotranches:a7 — -year 1.250% 750 million

Finally, on February 19, 2020, Orange and Free Mobile signed an
amendment extending until December 31, 2022 the termination period
for Free Mobile s national roaming on Oranges 2G and 3G networks.
This amendment is currently under review by Arcep which informed

Section 1.4 Operating activities) . They take into account the events
known on the date of this document mentioned in Section 3.2.1 above.
They were compiled and prepared on a basis comparable with the
historical financial information and consistent with the Groups
accounting policies.

Moreover, the ambition, announced on December 4, 2019, to
implement an additional net savings plan of | billion euros by 2023,
on a defined indirect cost base of 14 billion euros in 2019, has become

a commitment.

Finally, the target ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of telecoms
activities (see Section 3.1.5.7 Ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL
of telecoms activities) is maintained at 2x inthe medium -term.

These forward -looking statements are subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
