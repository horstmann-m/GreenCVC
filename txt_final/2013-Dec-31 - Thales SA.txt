1.1.1.2 Presentation of financial
information

Accounting policies

The consolidated financial statements of the Thales group are prepared
in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)
as approved by the European Union at 31 December 2013

These principles, described in note 23, are consistent with those applied
for the year ended 31 December 2012, except for the following
elements: IAS 19 revised (Employee Benefits), IFRS 13 (Fair value
measurement} and the amendment to IFRS 7 (Disclosures and Offsetting
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities). Annual Improvements to IFRS,
published in May 2012, has no significant impact for the Group.

Non-GAAP financial measures

In order to enable better monitoring and benchmarking of its operating
and financial performance, the Group presents two main non-GAAP

THALES REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013

indicators, excluding non-operating and non-recurring items. They are
determined as follows

= EBIT, an adjusted operating metric, equivalent to income from
operations excluding the amortisation of intangible assets acquired
(purchase price allocation, “PPA") recorded as part of important
business combinations.
Starting from | January 2014 and the start of application of the new
IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 standards, EBIT will also include share in net
income (loss) of equity affiliates.

Adjusted net income refers to net income, excluding [i] amortisation
of intangible assets acquired, (ii) disposal of assets and others,
(iii) change in fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments
(recorded in “other financial results” in the consolidated accounts),
(iv) actuarial gains or losses on long-term benefits (accounted within
the “finance costs on pensions and employee benefits” in the
consolidated accounts, net of the corresponding tax effects.

For reminder, only the consolidated financial statements are audited
by the statutory auditors, including the EBIT set out in note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements “Segment information". Adjusted
financial data other than provided in note 3 “Segment Information”, is
subject to the verification procedures applicable to all of the information

Exomars scientific programme, as well as several contracts for
satellites, including a dualuse communication satellite for Brazil,
an observation satellite for an African country and a new tranche
of the European Meteosat programme;

= in Transport, two major main line rail signalling orders were signed
in South Africa and Egypt.

= in Defence & Security, the Group booked several large orders: in
France, with the second tranche of the Contact software defined
radio programme, the Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft renovation
and the new F3R standard Rafale [laser targeting pod, electronic
systems}. In the United Kingdom, Thales was awarded a sensor system
support contract for the Royal Navy. In emerging markets, several
major contracts were captured in Defence & Security, particularly in
the Middle East (Saudi frigates upgrade, air defence radars in the
United Arab Emirates, optronics and critical infrastructure security)

Orders for a unit value of less than €10m represent almost half of the

order intake in terms of value.

New orders in emerging markets recorded a sharp rise (+30%)
compared to 2012, at €4,566m, and amounted to 32% of total
order intake, compared to 26% over the same period in 2012. This
growth was particularly significant in the Middle East, where the Group
order intake nearly doubled compared to 2012

New orders for Aerospace amounted to €4,130m, compared to
€4,051m for 2012. Excluding the impact due to the disposal of
activities in 201 2 (civil fixed-wing aircraft simulation, Diehl Aircabin),
Avionics order intake remained generally stable, as the continued
growth in on-board avionic activities, both original equipment and
support, and helicopters avionics compensated lower orders in in-flight
entertainment, tubes and imaging (after the high level of orders witnessed
in 2012). Space activities saw major growth in orders, particularly
in observation and exploration satellites (Exomars, Meteosat, Cosmo-
Skymed programmes}, whereas the Telecom segment was down,

despite the signature of the above-mentioned contract for a dualuse
communication satellite contract in Brazil.

In the Transport segment, new orders amounted to €1,492m, compared
to €1,653m in 2012 (during which several high unit value contracts
were notified: mainline rail network in Denmark, Singapore urban rail).
However, 2013 witnessed several significant commercial successes,
particularly in emerging markets: mainline rail signalling contracts in
South Africa (Cape region) and in Egypt (CairoAlexandria line), and
metros in China (Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Nanjing) and in Latin America
{Santiago}.

Defence & Security order intake stood at €7,661m versus €6,748m
in 2012, which represented an organic growth of 14%. This evolution
reflects the sharp rise in orders for Defence Mission Systems, driven in
particular by the UK Royal Navy sensor system support contract, the new
F3R standard Rafale and the French Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft
renovation and the Sawari | Saudi frigates upgrade. Orders for Secure
Communications and Information Systems recorded a strong increase,
particularly in radio-communications (new tranche of the French Contact
software defined radio contract), in military communications networks
(France, NATO), as well as in cybersecurity. Order intake for Land and
Air Systems was mainly stable, with successes in air defence, optronics
and weapons systems in the Middle East or in air traffic management
in the Philippines, Brazil and Africa

DONS order intake (at 35%) totalled €795m in 2013, compared
to €758m in 2012. The key orders booked during the period were
the Sawari | frigates upgrade contract for Saudi Arabia, as well as
amendments to the French FREMM frigates and submarine programmes.

activities (A400M). Tubes and imaging activities also made a positive
contribution to sales. Space sales increased slightly, both in observation
and exploration activities (Cosmo-Skymed, Exomars} and in Telecom

Systems sales were slightly down over the period, despite the increase
of radio communications (ramp up of the Contact contract in France)
and of cybersecurity. Land and Air Systems recorded slightly lower sales
in 2013, particularly in armaments and air defence activities. At the
same time, sales of Defence Mission Systems saw a major increase
over the period, mainly driven by the French Rafale programme, the

DCNS sales (at 35%) amounted to €1,176m at 31 December 2013,
a 14% increase compared to 31 December 2012. This evolution
reflects a good progress of the programmes in France (FREMM frigates,

In 2013, the Group's EBIT came to €1,003m, or 7.1% of sales
compared to €927m (6.5% of sales} en 201 2. This 8% increase in EBIT
(+11% in organic terms) reflects ongoing performance improvement
measures.

The Aerospace segment's EBIT continues to grow, reaching €370m
(8.3% of sales), compared to €297m (6.7% of sales} in 2012. In
Avionics, the marked growth in results, boosted by the civil avionics
activities and in-flight entertainment, is due to a favourable volume
impact and improved project execution. Space activities also recorded
improved EBIT in 2013, thanks to more efficient project management
and reduced restructuring costs.

The Transport segment posted an EBIT of €97m (6.5% of sales), stable
compared to 31 December 2012 (€95m, or 6.2% of sales}. This
stable profit level over 2013 reflects a more efficient execution of
contracts during the second halfyear, despite an unfavourable mix
and volume effect:

The EBIT of Defence & Security increased in 2013 and totalled €518m
(7.4% of sales}, compared to €504m in 2012 (7.1% of sales). Thanks
to good contract execution and efficient indirect cost control, Secure
Communications and Information Systems showed an increasing EBIT
in 2013. Defence Mission Systems recorded a slight increase in EBIT
compared to last year, despite higher restructuring costs, which offset

the project execution improvement. By contrast, EBIT for Land and
Air Systems was lower, mainly due to an unfavourable volume effect
during the period

The EBIT for DENS (at 35%) reached €63m at 31 December 2013,
significantly lower than in 2012 (20%) despite strong sales growth
The deterioration of operating profitability is due to difficulties in the
execution of civil nuclear projects.

Adjusted income of operating activities

Adjusted operating income came to €999m compared with €913m
in 2012 (+9%], in line with the increase in EBIT, as impairment on
intangible assets was limited at -E4m compared with -€15m in 2012

Adjusted financial income

Adjusted net financial expense, came to -€22m compared to -€40m
in 2012, mostly due to the fall in financial costs following the refinancing

Results"), as well as the decline in the effect of amortisation of intangible
assets acquired ("PPA"), which came to -€98m in 2013 compared
to-€112m the previous year, mainly linked to acquisitions of Alcatel’s
Space and Transport activities in 2007 and the entry (2007) then
increase of equity interest (2011) in DCNS

Income of operating activities

Consolidated income of operating activities came to €913m,
broadly stable compared to the previous year, with the progression
in EBIT in 2013 offset by the capital gains registered in 2012 from
the disposals of the civil simulation activity in the United Kingdom and
the 49% participation in Diehl Aircabin in Germany.

Financial result

Financial expense was -€51m compared to -€66m in 2012, mainly
due to the decrease in financial costs following the refinancing of
the 2013 bond payment at favourable market conditions. The other
components of pension charge declined to -€72m against -€99m

1.1.1.8 Proposed dividend

At the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2014, the Board of directors
will recommend the distribution to shareholders of a dividend of €1.12
per share, up 27%. This corresponds to an increase in the payout ratio
to 35% of the adjusted net income, compared to 30% last year.

If approved, the exdividend date will be 27 May 2014 and the
payment date 30 May 2014. The dividend will be paid entirely in cash
and will total €0.85 per share, after deducting the interim dividend of
€0.27 per share already paid in December 2013

1.1.2 Risk factors

Thales is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which could
materially affect its business, reputation, financial position, results or
ability to achieve its objectives. The risks described below are not the
only ones that Thales faces. Other risks, unknown to Thales on this date,
or which presently appear to be non-significant, could also have an
unfavourable impact on the business, profitability and financial position
of the Group or its ability to achieve its objectives:

Generally, Thales may be faced with a number of financial, legal,
operational and strategic risks.

1.1.2.1 Financial risks

1.1.2.1.1 Liquidity

Thales’ liquidity risk corresponds to its level of exposure to changes in
the main market indicators that could lead to an increase in the cost of
credit or even to a temporary limitation of access to external sources
of financing

The Group manages this risk by trying to anticipate its cash needs and
ensures that these are covered by the Group's shorHerm and longterm
financial resources as follows:

= shareholders’ equity, listed by heading in note 14 to the consolidated
financial statements;

= gross debt, listed by maturity in note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements;

= committed, undrawn credit facilities granted by banks as backup to
the commercial paper programme and acting as a financial reserve
These are described in more detail in note 21 to the consolidated
financial statements.

The principle of centralising the entities’ shortterm assets and liabilities
(cash pooling) is applied to the combination of entities in the same
currency zone (euro zone, sterling zone, dollar zone and Australian
dollar zone, etc.) and, in some cases, in the same country.

14. THALES REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013

1.1.1.9 Outlook for 2014

Order intake in emerging markets should continue to increase, with
double-digit growth expected for 2014, allowing to offset the expected
fall of order intake from mature countries, particularly in defence markets.

Sales should remain stable.

A continuing drive to improve performance should enable the Group
to post a further increase in EBIT, which should increase by 5 to 7%
compared to 2013

Through the consolidation and centralisation of cash requirements and
surpluses of its units, the Group is in a position to:

= simplify cash management and match the cash positions of units to
produce a single consolidated position that is easier to manage; and

= gain prime access to financial markets through the parent company’s
financing programmes, rated by Standard & Poor's and Moody's
(see below)

At 31 December 2013, cash recorded under consolidated assets

amounted to €3,023.8m (compared with €2,518.3m at end-201 2),

including

= €2,051.7m held by the parent company and available for immediate
use (€1,721.8m in 2012);

= €501.8m in the bank credit balances of subsidiaries (€392.8m in
2012), most of them outside of France. This figure includes, inter
alia, payments received in the last few days of the financial year and
subsequently transferred to the corporate treasury account;

= €470.3m in cash held directly by the companies in joint ventures
(prorated by Thales’ interest in each joint venture), including €218.5m
for DCNS for which Group cash pooling cannot be used in certain
cases (€403.7m in 2012, of which €191.3m for DCNS)

Cash at bank and equivalents at yearend is solely invested in bank

deposits, in very shorterm bank certificates of deposit with firsttier

banks or in money market funds. At the date of publication, Thales’

credit risk ratings were as follows

Moody’s Standard & Poor's

Medium and long-term loans A2 BBB+
Outlook Negative Positive
Commercial paper & shortterm

loans Prime-1 A2

The decrease of Thales’ credit risk rating doesn't place at risk financial
covenants included in financing contracts. The coming into effect of
the unique clauses providing for accelerated repayment would only
apply in the event that the State no longer held its golden share and,
simultaneously, the ratio of consolidated net financial debt to EBITDA
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) were
to exceed 3

www.thalesgroup.com


--- Page 8 ---

A lower rating would result in an increase (capped) in the margins
applicable to the committed credit facility of €1.5bn (described in
note 21 to the consolidated financial statements}; at the same time,
these margins would be improved (with a minimum threshold) in the
event of a rating upgrade.

1.1.2.1.2 Interest rates

Thales is exposed to interest rate volatility and in particular its impact
on the conditions associated with variable-rate financing. To limit this
risk, Thales operates an active policy of interest rate hedging,

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 2013

Group management report

The Corporate Financing and Treasury Department consolidates data on
Thales’ exposure to interest rate risk and uses the appropriate financial
instruments to hedge those risks.

Thales policy is to control interest rate and counterparty risks and to
optimise its funding and banking operations by consolidating and
pooling the cash surpluses and requirements of all its units

The breakdown of Thales’ debt by type of interest rate is described
in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. The table below
summarises the Group's exposure to interest rate risk before and after
hedging. Based on the Group's average net cash (taking into account
hedging instruments), a 1% rise in interest rates would decrease financial

expense in 2013 by €12m (compared to €11.1m in 2012)

a. Asa general rule, Thales is structurally immune to exchange rate
fluctuations for a significant part of its business activity. More than
40% of Thales’ sales are generated in the euro zone, which is also
where most of its industrial operations are located. More generally,
the reinforcement of the Group's international industrial footprint
allows the Company to manufacture and invoice in local currency,
thereby eliminating exchange rate risk on local sales.

b. The accounts of Thales subsidiaries located in countries where
the official currency is not the euro are translated into euros in the
Group's consolidated financial statements. A fall in these currencies
against the euro is likely to have a negative impact on the accounts.
lis impact on profitability is limited, however, since the cost base
of these subsidiaries is essentially in the same currency as their
sales. The main currencies are the Pound sterling, the US dollar,
the Canadian dollar and the Australian Dollar.

«. For certain Group businesses (civil avionics and tubes, civil space,
etc.}, the US dollar ("USD") is the reference transaction currency. For
business activities outside the dollar zone (the in-flight entertainment
business is based essentially in the United States and is therefore
largely immune to this risk), a specific currency risk hedging policy
is implemented

e For equipment transactions (avionics and tubes], this policy is
defined on the basis of sales forecasts in USD, after accounting
for corresponding purchases in USD. For these transactions, net
exposure to dollar risk represents around 3% of the Group's total
sales for 2013

For longer-term programmes in markets traditionally denominated in
USD (primarily in civil space and simulators), each bid is examined
for profitability in the light of the effect of currency fluctuations,
after accounting for corresponding purchases in USD, and, if
necessary, is specifically hedged through market transactions
(forward exchange-rate contracts and options)

Where necessary, a similar approach is adopted for other Thales
activities if a customer specifically requires a contract denominated
in USD on an ad hoc basis.

Overall, net exposure represented around 4% of the Group's total
sales for 2013

e As well as this direct dollar risk, which concerned around 7%
in total of consolidated sales at end-2013, the Group is also
exposed to an “indirect” dollar risk on contracts denominated in
currencies other than the dollar. This occurs when it is bidding
against companies that benefit from a cost base in dollars. Analysis
by product line and region shows that approximately one quarter
of total sales may be exposed to this “indirect” dollar risk

The “dollar risk" is thus the main currency risk that Thales needs to
hedge. The figures corresponding to the hedging of business-related
dollar risk are as follows:

= USD 2,795m, the amount of financial instruments hedging net firm
commitments (USD risk against Euro, Canadian dollar and Pound
sterling) at 31 December 2013 compared to USD 3,102m at
31 December 2012;

Group management report

= USD 281m, the amount of financial instruments hedging bids in
USD against the Euro, Canadian dollar and Pound sterling at
1 December 2013 compared to USD 238m at 31 December 2012

Operating receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency
are exchange-rate hedged and therefore not exposed to currency risk

The change in value of financial instruments (forward transactions) used
as cash flow hedges is recognised in shareholders’ equity. A decrease
(increase) of 5% in the US dollar compared to the Euro, Pound sterling
and Canadian dollar, would have increased (decreased) shareholder's
equity by approximately €103m at 31 December 2013 compared to
€118m at 31 December 2012. The premium/discount component is
not eligible to cash flow hedge accounting and is recognised through
profit and loss. In 2013, the change in market value of the discount/
premium was -€1 1m

The change in value of financial instruments matched with portfolios of
sales offers which are not eligible for hedge accounting is recognised in
profit and loss. A decrease (increase) of 5% in the US dollar compared
to the Euro, Pound sterling and Canadian dollar, would have increased
(decreased) the result by approximately €2m at 31 December 2013
compared to €5m at 31 December 2012

Foreign currency-denominated financial debt does not generate any
exposure in profit and loss, as it is either denominated in the functional
currency of the entity in which it is recognised, or is used as a net
foreign investment hedge.

b) Management of risks relating to foreign
currency-denominated assets

Thales hedges a very limited part of its foreign currency-denominated

assets, mainly those likely to be disposed of at a future date. The

main criteria for determining whether or not a given foreign currency

denominated asset should be hedged are as follows

= the nature of the business involved;

a the structure of Thales’ commitment with respect to jointly-held
companies, in particular the specific features of the shareholders’
agreement in each joint venture

In general, hedging is achieved by loans or currency swaps in the

same currency as the assets to be hedged. The actual application of

this policy also depends on

a the objective of optimising hedges in the light of market conditions
(availability of foreign currency, interest rates, hedging rate, etc.);

the risks inherent in the future value of the assets being hedged and
the nature of the business of the corresponding subsidiaries.

representing 1.21% of the share capital

1.1.2.1.5 Off-balance-sheet commitments

a) Pension commitments

Defined-benefit pension plans are in place for certain Thales employees,
mainly in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and are externally
funded by the Company under the provisions of the applicable national
legislation.

At 31 December 2013, Thales’ commitments in the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands toward current employees (access to these plans
has been closed to new employees in the UK), former employees and
retired employees amounted to €4,314m for both countries, hedged

€802m. At 31 December 2013, these investments consisted of

= 38% in equities;

= 37% in fixed-rate bonds;

= 8% in inflation linked bonds;

= 7% in alternative liquid investments;

= 6% in alternative long-term investments (e.g. real estate, infrastructure,
etc.);

= 4% in cash

Changing market parameters could affect the amount of the shortfall

and the annual costs of defined-benefit plans. At 31 December 2013,

the main risk variables were as follows, listed in order of importance:

= a reduction or increase in the discount rate applied to liabilities,
which could increase or reduce the unfunded status; this variable

is partly offset by changes in the value of fixed-rate hedging bonds
held as plan assets and interest rate swaps;

changes in the total return on investments in equities and other assets;

www.thalesgroup.com


--- Page 10 ---

= changes in the forecast inflation rate;
= a substantial change in mortality tables;
= exchange rate fluctuations (mainly sterling against the euro}

Thales has introduced quarterly reporting on its pension plan positions
and makes regular projections measuring the sensitivity of unfunded status
to possible changes in market parameters taking into account correlation
factors. In some countries, such as the UK and the Netherlands, Thales
is committed to defined-benefit pension schemes, but plan assets are
managed by trustees in accordance with the applicable regulations and
in consultation with the Group. Plan assets are allocated with regard
to the long-term nature of the commitments they cover.

b) Parent company guarantees

Thales, as the parent company, issues guarantees on commitments
undertaken by its subsidiaries on commercial contracts. These
guarantees are centralised by the Group Corporate Financing &
Treasury Department.

Guarantees are issued out of an envelope of €3bn dedicated each year
to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer by the Board of directors.
Prior to each renewal of the authority granted to the Chairman & Chief
Executive Officer, the Group's Treasury and Funding Department reports
to the Board of directors on the level of use of this envelope, based
on the monitoring carried out by the Group Corporate Financing &
Treasury Department.

At 31 December 2013, outstanding guarantees issued by the parent
company in support of its subsidiaries stood at €10,884m. This figure
includes all commitments given in relation to Thales Alenia Space
(matched by a counter-guarantee from Finmeccanica in proportion to
its 33% interest in Thales Alenia Space).

Thales manages risks connected to these parent company guarantees
and optimises the financial conditions of the transactions guaranteed
The main objectives of this risk management policy are as follows:

= to limit risks to those corresponding to normal commitments on
commercial contracts, particularly in terms of volume and duration;

= to limit the issue of guarantees to commitments made by wholly-
owned subsidiaries, with guarantees on commitments by consortia
or joint ventures only in proportion to the Group's equity interest
or counterguaranteed by the other shareholder in proportion to its
interest;

= toenable its subsidiaries to benefit, when appropriate, from the credit
rating of the parent company by controlling the financial conditions
of the transactions guaranteed

Client credit

Credit risk relates to the risk that a party to a contract will default on its
commitments or fail to pay what it owes.

1.1.2.1.6

a) Risk relating to failure of a private-sector customer
Nongovernmental customers (aircraft manufacturers, airlines, private
infrastructure operators and industry] account for approximately 25%
of Thales’ sales. These customers may encounter major and/or
prolonged financial difficulties that could lead to payment defaults or
order cancellations. Such occurrences could have a negative impact
on Thales’ sales, profitability and financial position

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 2013

Group management report

To mitigate these risks, Thales conducts regular analysis of the ability
of customers to meet their obligations. When necessary, Thales may
request bank guarantees or corporate guarantees, or may use credit
insurers.

b) Credit risk relating to public-sector customers

Public, Government and institutional customers account for around 75%
of Thales’ sales. Thales works with a large number of countries. Some
of these could present a significant credit risk which could, for example,
lead them to suspend an order in production, or make them be unable
to pay on delivery, as agreed under the terms of the contract. To limit
its exposure to these risks, Thales takes out insurance with export credit
agencies (such as Coface in France] or private insurers.

At 31 December 201 3, only two customers accounted for annual sales
for Thales in excess of €500m: the French State (around €3bn, including
one third related to DCNS) and the British State (approx. €1bn). At
31 December 2013, these two countries still have firstclass or high
quality ratings (France AA by S&P’s and Aal by Moody's - UK AAA
by S&P’s and Aal by Moody's)

1.1.2.2 Litigation

1.1.2.2.1 Compliance with laws and regulations

The Group operates its business in a strict and evolving complex legal
and regulatory environment, both nationally and internationally.

The legal and regulatory framework in which Thales operates covers a
broad range of areas, relating in particular to company law, financial
market regulation, fiscal legislation, labour law, export control and
measures to combat corruption and money laundering

Thales is able to monitor developments within this legal and regulatory
framework through its international network. The Company is not always
able to foresee them, however, and in this respect its business could
be affected

Despite the steps taken by Thales as a company to comply with all
applicable legislation, risks still exist due to their inherent nature, the
interpretative powers of regulatory agents and changes in legal/judicial
precedent and sanctioning powers.

In most cases, regulators in conjunction with the judicial authorities
have the right to initiate legal proceedings, which could expose the
Group or its employees to civil, administrative or criminal rulings. Such
attuling could, if applicable, involve a temporary ban on trading, which
would in tun have an adverse impact on the Group's profitability and
financial position

To manage this complexity, Thales has set up a Risks & Internal
Control Committee, which uses legal and regulatory riskmapping to
evaluate and monitor the implementation and continuous improvement
of compliance plans at each unit. Compliance actions rely for these
needs on networks of compliance officers who may be specialists
(export control], on risk sponsors in charge of the prevention of each of
the major risks identified and monitored by the Risks & Internal Control
Committee, or on a dedicated organisation as regards international
trade (cf. below)

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 2013

Group management report

The Risks & Internal Control Committee participates in the preparation
of the annual audit plan and monitors the conclusions of the regular
controls conducted by the Internal Audit Department in these
compliance areas

Regular reports are submitted to the Audit and Accounts Committee
of the Thales Board of directors, which in turn may issue compliance
audit directives within the entire Group

a) Management of commercial activities

Because of its presence in more than 50 countries and the diversity
of its markets and business segments, Thales is subject to national
laws, particularly those resulting from the transposition of international
conventions (OECD convention, UN convention to fight corruption,
European Union convention, Council of Europe conventions, etc.) and
to international norms and standards to fight corruption

Infringement of these laws could have serious legal consequences for
the individuals or entities concerned. It could also have a significant
impact on the image and reputation of the Group as a whole

In response to the regulatory requirements in terms of prevention of
corruption and business ethics in general, Thales has for a number
of years operated a strict international compliance and integrity
programme. This programme is regularly assessed and readjusted
according to changes in legislation and external risks (country risks,
etc.}, internal risks (areas for improvement identified by the internal audit,
risks committee etc.) and the Group's commercial strategy.

It is implemented on the basis of a coherent set of directives that
is included in the Group's reference system, dedicated units and
independent control resources

Business risks are addressed throughout all governance processes.
From the preliminary phase of a project, these operating processes
envisage action plans to mitigate business risks, focusing particularly
on the prevention of corruption.

Thales strictly governs the use of agents and consultants through a very
detailed procedure, which requires in-depth preliminary verifications
(due diligence) — reinforced by the analysis of red flags or risk factors,
as well as appropriate representations and engagements from
these consultants. Designed by the Group's Ethics and Corporate
Responsibility Department, this procedure, updated in early 2013, is
regularly revised in consultation with the Group Legal Department and
the Sales and Marketing Department.

In addition, to underpin its strategy of strengthening its presence
internationally and its establishment in target countries, Thales vets
and selects local industrial partners. The vetting and selection process is
aimed at sealing long+erm partnerships with local industrial companies
that meet a series of criteria with regard to business integrity and
ethics, competence and expertise. This scheme is part of the policy
of deploying tailored and reasonable prior due diligence procedures
for third parties

THALES REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013

An international, dedicated network, independent of the operational
commercial structures, conducts the verifications required, enhanced by
outside studies and diagnostics performed by companies that specialise
in business intelligence — during the vetting and selection phases for
agents, consultants and local industrial partners for Thales.

In addition, by relying on risk mapping and rigorous internal control
procedures, Thales’ Audit & Internal Control Department regularly
conducts compliance and integrity audit missions which cover all
processes to manage commercial risks.

Thales is particularly keen to make its employees aware of ethical
business conduct as soon as they join the Group. Adherence and
accountability are key to the awareness and training model designed
by the Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Department. A broad array
of tools (Code of Ethics, reference guide, best practice guides, etc.) and
training sessions {face-to-face training and elearning are now available
in French, English and German) is available to staff throughout their
professional lives. Special attention is paid to employees involved in
the sales processes, project management and purchasing. The training
plan for “Business Ethics and Preventing Corruption”, which is world-
wide in scope, is as a priority intended for this group of employees.

Thales also continues to disseminate and foster best practices among its
suppliers and subcontractors, requiring them to subscribe to the terms of
its Purchasing & Corporate Responsibility Charter. In this connection, in
France in 2012 Thales received government recognition for responsible
supplier relations. This is a three-year label given to French businesses
that have demonstrated longterm balanced relations with their suppliers.

Thales also actively participates in national professional organisations
(MEDEF, GIFAS, ADS"!, etc.) and international organisations (ASD"|,
ICC*!, B20", etc.) dealing with business ethics, and within the working
groups of intergovernmental organisations (OECD, United Nations,
ISO"), etc.). In September 2013, Thales signed the recommendations
of the Chairmen and CEOs of member companies in the B20
“Transparency and Anti-corruption” Task Force intended for Heads of
State of the G20, which calls on them to step up the fight against
corruption by facilitating the emergence of new approaches (industry
actions, public/ private-sector dialogue, etc.]. Thales was also chosen
by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to present its anti-corruption
policy at the Fifth Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations
Convention against Corruption. This conference, which took place in
November 2013 in Panama, was attended by 1,600 representatives
from 132 countries, as well as all governmental or non-governmental
organisations concerned by these issues; the choice of the French
government illustrates the reputation of the Group for business ethics
and corporate social responsibility.

www.thalesgroup.com


--- Page 12 ---

The Group actively participates in a variety of initiatives in the fight
against corruption, both at European level (Business Ethics Committee
of the ASD) and under the global sectoral initiative of the Aeronautics
and Defence industries (IFBEC!"!) whose most recent world forum took
place in Washington in September 2013

Thales is also a stakeholder in international standardisation work carried
out within the ISO on compliance and anti-corruption programmes.

At the same time, since 2012, Thales has been ranked by TI - an
NGO working to combat corruption worldwide - as one of the top
10 companies of the Defence sector. The Transparency International?!
report published in October 2012 presents an analysis of the corruption
prevention programmes of the world’s 129 biggest defence sector
companies. The companies are assessed in five areas (leadership,
governance and organisation — risk assessment — company codes and
policies - training — personnel and helplines) with regard to the ethics
and anti-corruption systems they have put in place

In addition, for the second consecutive year, Thales obtained the
“Global Compact Advanced" level of the UN Global Compact, which,
by respecting 21 specific criteria, is the highest level of reporting and
performance in responsible development. Among the 8,000 companies
that are members of the Global Compact, only 360 have so far
obtained the Global Compact Advanced level — 26 of them are French
and only one is in the aerospace & defence sector.

b) Export control

Exports account for a significant proportion of Thales’ business. Many
of the Group's products and systems are designed for military or dual-
use applications. Consequently, the export of these products or systems
to customers located outside Thales’ domestic markets where they are
manufactured, particularly in the defence sector, may be subject to
limitations, export licences or specific export controls (imposed by the
countries in which Thales operates, as well as by other countries where
the suppliers of component products or technologies are based, most
notably the United States)

There are no guarantees that (i) the export controls to which Thales is
subject will not be tightened, (ii) new-generation products or systems
developed by Thales will not be subject to similar or tighter controls
and, (iii) geopolitical factors will not make it impossible for Thales or
its suppliers to obtain export licences for certain customers or make it
more difficult for Thales to execute previously signed contracts. Further
limitations on access to military markets would thus have a negative
impact on Thales’ business, profitability and financial position

Thales has put in place systems and formal procedures to ensure
compliance with applicable regulations and controls, and reinforces
these measures through awareness-aising programmes with dedicated
elearning modules. Operating units have access to a network of
specialists within the Group, in charge of monitoring the application
within operational units of compliance rules determined at Group level
as well as monitoring the necessary authorisations and conformity of
their implementation

{1} International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 2013

Group management report

c) Competition
Thales’ business activities are subject to a wide range of national and

international regulations mainly aimed at combating anticompetitive
practices.

Infringement of these rules could lead to severe sanctions, such as fines,
payment of damages, and legal bans. They could also have a serious
impact on the Group's reputation

To avoid any such infringements, Thales has initiated an awareness-
raising programme to these rules, in particular through the rolkout of a
dedicated elearning tool and training programmes.

d) Intellectual property

Thales is exposed to two main types of intellectual property risk:
dependence on third-party technology and third-party actions
against the Company for perceived infringement of their intellectual
property rights

To reduce the risk of reliance on critical third-party technology, Thales
has implemented an identification process and management of each
situation with a precise, strategic "Make/Team/Buy” (MTB) plan

Given the nature of its activities and the specific features of its products,
Thales conducts most of its research and development work in-house and
controls the technology which is critical to the business. Thales is one
of the largest filers of patents in France and was recognised in 2012
and 2013 by Thomson Reuters as one of the 100 most innovative
companies in the world. Thales’ extensive intellectual property portfolio
(over 15,000 patents, as well as software and know-how) and its
presence throughout the value chain (equipment, systems and systems
of systems} reduce its reliance on third-party technology. As a result,
Thales’ dependence on such technology can be considered very low.

To reduce the risk of third-party actions for alleged infringement of their
intellectual property rights by Thales entities, the Group identifies and
analyses this risk in the context of its own patent filing procedures and/
or when embarking on technical research or product development.

In the event of a third-party infringement claim against a Thales company,
the legal and technical analysis of the allegedly infringing products and
intellectual property rights are handled centrally by Thales experts, with
the assistance of specialist external consultants where needed

1.1.2.2.2 Litigation
Due to the nature of its business activities, Thales is exposed to the risk
of technical and commercial litigation

To prevent disputes or limit their impact, Thales policy is to systematically
seek alternative methods of dispute resolution. This policy is reviewed
on a regular basis to take into account changes in the Company's core
areas of business and is backed by employee training programmes.

In addition, Thales implemented a procedure several years ago to
centralise all civil and criminal litigation and claims. These are handled
by the corporate legal affairs department, with the support of the Group
companies concerned.

Group management report

At the end of 2002, a group of French manufacturers, including Thales
and one of its subsidiaries, collectively received a request for arbitration
relating to the execution of old contracts. In proportion to each industrial
partner's involvement, Thales would have been liable for around 20% of
the total claim of $260 million. Under an agreement signed in 2003,
the client withdrew its request for arbitration

In November 2012, the claimant filed a new request for arbitration
for a revised amount of €226 million. Industrial partners are strongly
challenging this claim and at this date it is not possible to evaluate
any potential financial risk. Consequently, Thales has not recognised
any provision

This procedure is still in process

The Company knows of no other governmental, legal or arbitration
procedures, pending or threatened, that are likely to have or that have
had a significant impact on the financial situation or profitability of the
Company and/or Group over the last 12 months

1.1.2.3 Risks related to Thales’ businesses

1.1.2.3.1 Competitive environment

The markets in which Thales operates are highly competitive, both
in terms of international groups, especially in a context of shrinking
defence budgets in their home countries, and in terms of local or niche
companies in certain market segments. This competitive pressure could
negatively impact Thales’ commercial position, sales and profits

There is also no guarantee that competition will not intensify, particularly
in an unfavourable environment, or that Thales will be able to successfully
fight its current or future competitors.

In order to limit the impact of this risk, Thales continues its research and
development efforts in order to provide competitive and differentiating
elements to the Group's operating units and also works to upgrade
its product offer in order to meet the needs of its customers, in both
defence and civil markets

Unfavourable trends in the civil
aviation market

1.1.2.3.2

Demand for air travel appears closely linked to general economic
trends, but is also affected by specific factors, such as the characteristics
of aircraft fleets in service, regulatory changes (new environmental
standards, deregulation, etc.) and the ability of airlines to access
financing. In addition, the civil aviation market is also susceptible
to the effects of intensification (real or perceived) of terrorist activity,
as well as conflicts and epidemics or disasters, which can have an
important, if temporary, impact on air traffic and thus affect the entire
civil aviation market.

The economic environment is therefore likely to remain unsettled,
especially in Europe. In order to remain profitable in a difficult market,
airlines could cancel or postpone orders and aircraft manufacturers
might have to reduce production rates. This environment could also lead

20 THALES REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013

the airlines to reduce or delay their maintenance expenditure or their
investments in inflight entertainment systems. Similarly, air navigation
service providers could reduce or delay investments in air traffic control
equipment and systems. Were they to materialise, these factors could
have a negative impact on Thales’ profitability and financial position

To limit the impact of this risk, Thales is pursuing action on two fronts
(i) ongoing improvements to its competitive performance and industrial
flexibility in order to better manage trading fluctuations during the cycle
and (ii) a comprehensive strategy seeking a balance within the business
portfolio (with exposure to the civil aviation market reduced to around
15% of Group sales}.

1.1.2.3.3 Dependence on public procurement

Thales generates most of its business from governments, particularly
in the defence markets in France and the UK, and, to a lesser extent,
in the rest of Europe, North America and Australia. In these markets,
public spending is dependent on political and economic factors and
is therefore likely to fluctuate from one year to the next. A significant
reduction in defence budgets, particularly in Europe as part of a
more restrictive budget policy, could affect the Group's business and
profitability. In effect, a reduction in the budget resources of government
customers could generate delays in order booking, contract execution,
payments or a decrease in funding for research and development
programmes.

Thales has based its strategy on a balanced portfolio of defence
operations (approximately 55% of sales) and civil operations
(approximately 45% of sales). The overall solidity of the portfolio
is underpinned by a diversified base of orders with a unit value of
less than €10Om. Finally, the broad geographic spread of Thales’
business, particularly through its international operations, ensures further
iversification of its customer base.

1.1.2.3.4 Control of projects and programmes

Many of Thales’ products and systems are highly complex due to
their advanced technology content, the rigorous operational constraints
and harsh environments in which they operate (which require them to
be extremely reliable) and the contractual arrangements surrounding
their sale (comprehensive prime contractorships for large-scale systems,
public-private partnerships or equivalent, local shares, compensation
commitments etc.)

The actual cost of design, development and manufacture may therefore
exceed initial cost estimates, which in turn may adversely impact
Thales’ results and financial position, especially considering that the
associated contracts are generally based on a fixed, all-inclusive price.
In addition, many contracts include stringent performance levels and/
or tight delivery schedules for the products or systems sold, particularly
given the increased competition. If Thales is unable to deliver these
products or systems in line with the required level of performance and/
or delivery schedule, customers may demand penalty payments or
even decide to terminate the contract. The occurrence of such events
could have a material impact on Thales’ results and financial position

www.thalesgroup.com


--- Page 14 ---

Bid and project management is therefore subject to a detailed risk
management and assessment process. Thales ranks the various levels
of criticality. Critical bids and projects are specifically monitored at
the management level of the operating entities (business lines, Global
Business Units) and, as needed, by the Group's executive management.

Contractual risk assessment is an integral part of the tendering process.
Depending on the complexity of the bid, this procedure involves a
number of steps which progressively reveal the estimated level of
profitability and the associated risks to be assessed. Particular attention
is paid to long-term sales contracts that include fixed prices valid for
the entire duration of the agreement.

For certain contracts that run for several years and involve products
and services with a high degree of complexity, regular reviews are
organised in order to monitor the technical and financial progress:

The Group continues to pay particular attention to analyses and
action plans for the management efficiency of bids and projects by
measuring and monitoring financial variance on the projects and the
implementation of corrective actions

The Group also continued action plans to improve the management
of bids and projects, engineering and the supply chain. These actions
aim in particular to:

= improve the management of commitments made, with widespread
use of independent peer reviews, closer involvement of Purchasing,
Production, Legal and Quality Control and the introduction of a
“Project Design Authority” responsible for developing the technical
project solution (during the bid or project execution phase);

identify the centres of expertise (R&D, integration, production and
services) within Thales in order to increase synergies and expertise
and provide the best responses to the solution;

improve the development of product lines in order to streamline new
developments and thus reduce risks;

introduce advanced training for project managers to obtain
International Project Management Association (IPMA) certification
At the end of 2013, nearly 650 project managers within the Group
have gained IPMA certification, with approximately 240 certified
during the year.

1.1.23.5 Political risks

Thales generates a significant proportion of its sales in emerging markets
and countries that can be, or could become, politically or economically
unstable. These markets might therefore present risks with the potential
to affect the Group's profitability and financial position

In particular, a change in government, major political event, armed
conflict, act of terrorism, sharp deterioration in the balance of payments,
industrial action, strike or protest could lead to various types of risks.
These include:

= more restrictive currency control, with limitations or exclusions on
withdrawing currency from a client country, preventing it from
honouring its financial commitments towards Thales;

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 2013

Group management report

impairment of assets because of devaluations of the local currency
or other measures taken by public authorities that significantly affect
the value of operations;

expropriation (by confiscation, nationalisation, requisition, etc.) or the
forced sale of Thales’ interest in a local company, or, more broadly,
discriminatory measures that compromise Thales’ operations in a
country;

a security situation entailing a risk of attack on the physical safety
of its employees and/or its facilities, which strongly limit or prevent
Thales from assuming its performance obligations under a contract,
or reduce or prohibit the use of its local industrial assets;

an unexpected breach of a contract or commitment;

an unfair call of a bond or a guarantee;

the non-certification of documents eligible for payment, or non-
payment on the due dates stipulated in a contract, which prevent
the anticipated progress of that contract.

To limit the financial impact of these risks, Thales uses government and/
or private-sector insurers when necessary to provide appropriate cover.
tt may also transfer receivables without recourse to financial institutions

In addition, the Group has deployed a global procedure for employee
security, protection and monitoring to ensure they have an appropriate
level of security in the countries in which they perform their work.

1.1.2.3.6 Violations of data confidentiality

Thales is exposed to the risk of attacks on the security of its industrial
infrastructures or its information technology systems (hacking attempts
to access confidential information, threats to the physical security of
facilities, etc.). The occurrence of such events could affect the rollout
of the Group's activities and its reputation and, consequently, its results
and financial situation

In its defence businesses, the Group is subject to different national
regulations requiring it to implement measures to protect its employees
and industrial assets.

The Group is therefore subject to a large number of audits and
inspections by the national supervisory authorities.

The Group has also established internal policies to protect its sites and
sensitive information systems and increase employee awareness. These
policies, which are replicated in all the subsidiaries, are relayed by
the network of information system safety and security officers in the
countries and the Global Business Units. For example, the application
of Thales’ “Information System Security” policy, based on ISO 27000,
relies on the secure architecture of its information system, the critical
awareness of users and IT personnel and appropriate means of
monitoring and surveillance; it is regularly assessed through audits,
wulnerability tests and surveys

Group management report

1.1.23.7 Management of supplier risk

Purchases constitute a very significant proportion of Thales’ business,
representing nearly half its sales in manufacturing, services, equipment
and subsystems. Thales is thus exposed to the risk of industrial, technical
or financial failure of any of its suppliers, which in turn could affect the
Company's profitability and performance.

There are two major types of supplier risk

= legal or regulatory non-compliance (ethics, export control, intellectual
property, etc.); these risks are handled by the departments concerned
using the Group Risk Management system, with the support of the
Purchasing Department;

structural and operational risks that could disrupt supply are dealt with
by the Purchasing Department using the Group Risk Management
system. The Purchasing Department has identified two key triggers
supplier default and economic dependence. Although individual
events might be considered to have a minor financial impact, they
could potentially occur several times a year. The financial impact
could become significant if several events are considered together,
due to the domino effect and the large number of suppliers in Thales’
supplier panel

a) Management of the risks of supplier default

Supplier default could be caused by a major incident at one of its sites,
by its external environment (shortage of raw materials - particularly
critical materials - or components, major political instability, natural
disaster, etc.) or through mismanagement. The supplier's management
performance is monitored both in operating terms (lack of procurement
planning, failure to manage tier 2 suppliers, loss of control over
industrial processes, plant obsolescence, etc.) and in cross-disciplinary
and financial terms (poor skills management, loss of know-how, fall
in sales, mismanagement of working capital requirement, cash flow
problems, administration or bankruptcy protection, etc.). A combination
of problems could lead to the disappearance of a company or its
takeover by investors with different interests from those of Thales.

Faced with this risk of a supply shortage, Thales seeks to implement a
dual sourcing (or alternative-source) policy for each technology family,
regularly updated and accompanied by buffer stocks that cover its
requirements until customer contracts have been fulfilled

In addition, taking into account the increased risk of fragility of certain
suppliers in the current economic climate, Thales has introduced a
special measure aimed at identifying, from among its critical suppliers,
those that would be particularly exposed financially and implementing
an appropriate action plan to ensure continuity of supply. Apart from
individual monitoring, analysis is carried out by technology field
in conjunction with the professional bodies concerned to identify
appropriate solutions.

THALES REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013

Alongside these financial supervision measures, Purchasing and
Quality Control have stepped up their appraisal, accreditation and
management of supplier performance to better identify structural risks.
Supplier performance audits are broad-based (quality control, industrial
maturity, flow optimisation, compliance with environmental regulations,
expertise in technical and technological processes, financial solidity,
etc.) and therefore allow a complete risk analysis to be carried out
When executing a purchasing contract, Thales closely monitors the
implementation by the supplier of measures aimed at tackling the risks
identified during the selection process

b) Management of the risks of economic dependence

The economic dependence of small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs] on Thales is considered a separate risk in its own right. It is
particularly significant now that the economic crisis has disrupted the
sales portfolios of a number of them, jeopardising the operating cycle
with Thales and potentially leading to a supply shortage

In order to mitigate this risk, the commitment rate (orders placed by
Thales as a percentage of the supplier's total annual sales) is monitored
for each panel of suppliers by market segment and for the main countries
where the Group is implanted (France, the UK, the Netherlands, etc.)
If the commitment rate exceeds 50% for more than two consecutive
years, an action plan coordinated with internal prescriptors and internal
users is drawn up and implemented in order to return to a reduced
commitment rate.

The procurement policy, supplier selection and performance monitoring
processes and supervisory and risk mitigation measures are all designed
to reduce these risks, both during the bidding phase and during the
preliminary project phase.

1.1.23.8 Raw materials risk

Given the nature of its business, Thales uses few raw materials.
The Group's exposure to raw materials risk is therefore negligible

1.1.2.3.9 Risk related to failure of equipment

or technology

Thales systems and equipment are highly complex and technical and
are likely to be integrated within high-value civil or military platforms.
A malfunction of any such systems, equipment or technologies could
result in client claims or third-party litigation. Thales could thus be held
liable in the event of damage to property or personal injury. Were
they to occur, such events would be liable to impact Thales’ results and
financial position, as well as its reputation

In order to limit the impact, Thales has put Group-wide procedures in
place (risk management, Design Authority, quality, documentation and
contractualisation). In addition, Thales conducts a policy to maintain
appropriate insurance coverage (see section 1.1.2.7 below]

www.thalesgroup.com


--- Page 16 ---

1.1.2.3.10 Risk of lower impact of performance
improvement measures

Thales initiated a plan to improve the Group's overall performance. This
performance plan provides a common framework within which the units
can implement plans and measurements adapted to their own issues in
terms of performance improvements. The programme, whose objectives
are validated during the multi-year budget preparations, covers all
Group issues in terms of growth, competitivity and talent development.

The actual results may differ significantly from the objectives. Performance
initiatives are based on economic and commercial assumptions defined
during the preparation of the Group's multi-year budget and do not
take into consideration any potential changes that could affect Thales’
operations or its markets, such as the development of new activities,
increased competition in its domestic or export markets or unfavourable
regulatory or legislative changes.

Furthermore, the future earnings and financial position of Thales could
be negatively impacted if the proposed initiatives could not be fully
implemented or if they failed to generate the expected results according
to the original timetable. The cost of implementing these initiatives could
also be higher than forecast.

Thales pays particular attention to the management and monitoring
of performance improvement initiatives. The Group's corporate
management regularly reviews the progress of the main initiatives
Expected impacts for all initiatives for the year are regularly updated
as part of the Group's steering process.

1.1.23.11 Human resources risk

a) Health and safety at work

Ensuring a healthy and safe working environment for its employees
pursuant to the laws in force, monitoring procedures, preventing
health and professional risks and employee training are key priorities
for Thales.

These principles are reflected in a structure designed to prevent risks
related to health and safety in the workplace. Concrete measures are
implemented to anticipate and manage health risks that might occur at
the international level. The creation of a permanent Health Supervision
Unit, a Crisis Unit in the event of a major international health risk and
the implementation of a specific procedure for missions in countries
posing a major health risk all contribute to better management of
the risks in this area. Finally, regular and specific monitoring of risks
(discriminatory practices, moral and sexual harassment, injuries to health
such as professional and psychosocial risks, etc.) that could affect the
Group's employees is conducted every year on the basis of specialised
indicators. Undertakings made by the Group HR Department on
employees’ occupational health and safety worldwide are on-going
Thus, new employees, whatever their country, can have a medical in
the year of recruitment with Thales.

Thales is also committed to increasing the quality of life in the
workplace. In France, negotiations have been conducted with trade
union organisations at Group level with the aim of reaching a new
agreement on “Quality of Life at Work", following on from an agreement
signed in 2009, which defined a general framework for prevention,
with a particular focus on the detection and prevention of psycho-social
risks by implementing preventive actions at employee level and by
collective preventive actions.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 2013

Group management report

Proof of the Group's continuing commitment to certification,
95 Thales entities (representing 65% of the workforce] had obtained
OHSAS 18001 certification by the end of 2013

b) Talent development

If Thales is not attractive enough to recruit the qualified staff it needs
in a timely manner and retain and motivate its employees to develop
and conduct its business, sales and operating profitability could be
negatively affected. Thales’ success and performance effectively
depend on its capacity to recruit employees in the different employment
markets, in France and abroad, the quality of the key skills and the
commitment of its employees, and its capacity to globally manage the
talents required for the development of its activity worldwide.

Thales therefore attaches great importance to its attractiveness and
positioning as a top employer, ensuring a good external image which
will boost recruitment and an internal situation that will contribute to
retaining employees.

Asan attractive and recognised employer in France, Thales also intends
to build its image in all the countries where the Group is already present
or is intending to develop

Thus, particular attention is paid to the systematic deployment of
recruitment tools and organisations in emerging markets. In addition,
a global recruitment function, attached to the HR general management
has been created to help the Group develop in these geographical
zones. The global process of identification and management of the
Group's talents has also been reinforced, by encouraging exchanges
between management teams in different parts of the organisation

Thales is also continuing its dynamic skills management policy for the
Group's main professional families. A steering committee per family,
composed of operational and HR managers, annually analyses
developments in the jobs, expertise, and the needs of the Company,
and establishes action plans (training, anticipated management of
internal mobility, external recruitment etc.). To complement this tool,
each year the Group's internal University updates the key programmes
in response to changing needs.

Finally, in 2013, the Group signed, with all the representative trade
unions in France, agreements to welcome young people in work
study programmes or those already graduated through the transfer
of knowledge (so-called “Generation contracts"), the development of
mixity in the organisation (Gender Equality Agreement), and anticipated
management of jobs and skills.

These agreements will enable the Group, in the coming months and
years in France, to better manage the integration of young graduates,
improve the development of critical skills, favour diversity and better
anticipate change in the Group

1.1.2.4 Environmental risks
For many years, Thales has conducted regular analysis and update
of environmental risks in accordance with its business activities,

scientific and technical developments and the emerging environmental
challenges.

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013

THALES 23

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 2013

Group management report

This analysis aims at

= ensuring that employees and surrounding residents are not exposed
to health and environmental risks (pollution, asbestos, etc]; through
their activities or work environment, including outside of Thales sites
and in production units;

ensuring the compliance of activities and products (substances,
waste, etc};

analysing the impact of new regulations, including on product design;

analysing the impact of the environment on activities (water stress,
climatic events, etc.);

specifying an appropriate organisation and associated action
plans, either at Group level or locally, according to the results of
this analysis.

In support of this analysis, an Environmental Management System has
been deployed at all sites in order to ensure the control and limitation
of the products’ and activities’ environment impacts. Integrated into the
Group commitments, this management system is applied to the different
functions. As such, environmental competences have been widened to
include engineering, research, procurement and contracts.

At the end of 2013, 125 entities had been certified ISO
representing 82% of the Group's workforce

At 31 December 2013, the amount of reserves for environmental
contingencies amounted to €7.8m

14001,

1.1.2.5 Risks relating to strategic
acquisitions and investments

Thales regularly looks to acquire new companies (as well as making
strategic investments and combining business activities through joint
ventures, etc.) in order to round out its technological portfolio and
strengthen its presence in certain markets. Integrating these businesses
within Thales could prove more difficult and take longer than envisaged,
requiring a more significant involvement by senior managers and the
teams concerned and, in turn, negatively impacting the Company's
results and financial position.

In addition, there are no guarantees that the newly acquired companies
will perform as well as expected in accordance with the initial business
plans, which form the basis of the investment decision. This type of
variance could lead to the recognition of impairment losses on goodwill
and other intangible assets, thereby negatively impacting Thales’ results
and financial position

Before any planned acquisitions, Thales conducts audits and due
diligence with the assistance of external consultants where necessary,
in order to analyse the fundamentals of the target company. A review is
also conducted at each key stage in the acquisition process to confirm
Thales’ interest and specify the necessary conditions and parameters
to ensure a successful outcome. The newly acquired company is then
integrated into Thales’ financial reporting system so that its performance
can be monitored.

24 THALES REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013

1.1.2.6 Risks linked to joint ventures,
consortiums and minority

investments

Thales generates an important part of its sales within the framework of
various consortiums, joint ventures and investments, where control is
shared with other partners.

The signing of partnerships and alliances with other market players is an
integral part of Thales’ strategy, particularly as part of its international
development, and the share of sales generated by consortiums,
common companies and investments is likely to increase

However, Thales exercises a variable degree of control over these
consortiums, common companies and investments. The risk of
disagreement or blockage, inherent in any jointlycontrolled entity, exists,
particularly in those where important decisions require the unanimity of
members or where there are limited exit rights.

Consequently, the Group ensures that appropriate governance modes
are defined, in order to best protect its interests. In addition, activities
managed by consortiums, common companies and investments are
integrated into the Group's financial reporting system in order to monitor
their performance and all the Group's procedures and directives apply
to joint ventures where Thales has exclusive control

1.1.2.7 Insurance

Thales’ Insurance and Risk Management Department, based at head
office and reporting to the SEVP Finance & Information Systems, is
responsible for the Group's insurance activities and insurable risk
management. It is in charge of Group operations and oversees policy
implementation by Group companies.

The Group covers the financial consequences of the risk of accidental
damage suffered or caused by property or people using appropriate
insurance policies with leading international insurance and reinsurance
companies.

The insurance policies arranged by the Group to cover these major
risks relate to areas such as

= damage to property and consequent operating losses;

transport;

testing and development;

aviation liability, including liability for aeronautical products and
hull/test flight insurance;

civil liability for space products;

risks of damage to or by naval vessels by subsidiaries, as naval
equipment suppliers;

general third-party liability;

environmental liability;

= liability of executive officers and directors.

www.thalesgroup.com


--- Page 18 ---

Whilst certain damageable events were notified to insurers, the Group
had no major loss in 2013

Thales’ policy is to arrange cover on the insurance market based on the
rates and limits that it considers reasonable, in view of the conditions
offered by the market. Limits are applicable to insurance for major
risks, while general exclusions for the entire market (e.g. asbestos}
also apply to Thales.

The maximum coverage limit of €1.3bn in 2013 for damage to
property and consequent business interruptions takes into account an
estimate of the maximum loss caused to an industrial site which the
Group could incur for direct damages and business interruptions

Levels of liability cover depend on the quantification of a reasonable
claim expectancy for Thales, as identified by the risk map of the main
business activities and at Group level, and on cover capacity available
on the insurance market. The insurance coverage for aviation liability
commitments, which is covered by a specific programme, amounts
to USD 2bn

The insurance industry, which was affected by the recent financial crisis,
is still trying to reduce its overall risk exposure. We are witnessing an
increase in insurance premiums, a rise in deductibles and additional
limits on the scope of cover. In addition, there are fewer insurers with
the necessary resources and financial capacity to insure major industrial
risks. There are no guarantees that Thales will be able in the future to
maintain current levels of insurance under similar financial conditions

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 2013

Group management report

In order to reduce its exposure to insurance market volatility, Thales
insures major risks on a twortier basis

= the Group's contribution, through captive insurance and reinsurance
companies, towards the settlement of claims, to a maximum net
retention of €13.5m per year, for damage to property and consequent
business interruptions, transport, general third-party liability, testing
and development and space risks;

= transfer to insurers of payment for catastrophic losses

An active Prevention and Protection policy for industrial sites is designed
to reduce the magnitude and frequency of the accidental risks of fire
or explosion and to detect other exposures, such as environmental or
natural disasters and the vulnerability of critical industrial facilities. In
2013, more than 80% of the assets insured were the subject of a “multi-
peril” audit by the insurers during their visits to the principal operating
sites and infrared thermography inspections by an outside organisation
specialised in the prevention of electrical damage.

In accordance with Group processes, measures were taken to minimise
business interruption and the consequences of any unforeseen events
An organisational structure and crisis management tools are in place
to deal as efficiently as possible with the immediate consequences of
a catastrophic event and to take the necessary emergency measures.

Thales continues to roll out professional indemnity cover for its staff. In
addition, specific and/or local cover has been arranged to comply
with the regulations in force and to satisfy the specific requirements of
certain activities or projects, particularly public-private partnerships.
