Corporate Profile

Bertelsmann operates in the core business fields of media and
services as well as education in around 50 countries worldwide.
The geographic core markets are Western Europe — in particular,
Germany, France and the UK — and the United States. In addition,
Bertelsmann is strengthening its involvement in growth markets
such as China, India and Brazil. As of the balance sheet date
December 31, 2015, the Bertelsmann divisions are RTL Group

future independent divisions of BMG, Bertelsmann Education
Group and Bertelsmann Investments, is not yet shown in the
present Consolidated Financial Statements.

Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is a capital market-oriented but
unlisted partnership limited by shares. As a Group holding
company, it exercises central corporate functions such as
the development of the Group’s strategy, capital allocation,
financing and management development. Internal corporate
management and reporting follow the Group's organizational
structure, which consists of the operating divisions plus
Corporate Investments and the Corporate Center.

RTL Group is the leading European entertainment network,
with interests in 57 television channels and 31 radio stations
and content production throughout the world. The television
portfolio of RTL Group includes RTL Television in Germany,
M6 in France and the RTL channels in the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Croatia and Hungary, as well as investment in
Atresmedia in Spain and RTL CBS Asia Entertainment Network
in Southeast Asia. Fremantle Media is one of the largest
international producers outside the United States Combining

the catch-up TV services of its broadcasters, the multichan-
nel networks BroadbandTV, StyleHaul and Dinimove
as well as Fremantle Media's more than 230 YouTube
channels, RTL Group has become the leading European media
company in online video. Furthermore, RTL Group owns a
majority stake in SpotX, one of the leading programmatic
video advertising platforms. The publicly traded RTL Group
S.A. is listed on the German MDAX index.

Penguin Random House is the world’s largest trade book pub-
lisher, with nearly 250 editorially independent imprints across
five continents. Its book brands include storied imprints such
as Doubleday, Viking and Alfred A. Knopf (United States),
Ebury, Hamish Hamilton and Jonathan Cape (UK), Plaza &
Janés and Alfaguara (Spain) and Sudamericana (Argentina),
as well as the international imprint Dorling Kindersley. Each
year Penguin Random House publishes over 15,000 new
titles and sells nearly 800 million books, e-books and audio
books. More than 110,000 English-, German- and Spanish-
language Penguin Random House titles are now available as
e-books. Germany’s Verlagsgruppe Random House, which
includes illustrious publishing houses such as Goldmann and
Heyne, is not part of Penguin Random House from a legal
point of view, but is under the same corporate management
and is part of the Penguin Random House operating division.

Gruner + Jahr is represented in over 20 countries with
around 500 media activities, magazines and digital busi-
nesses. G+J Deutschland publishes well-known magazines
such as “Stern,” “Brigitte” and “Geo.” Gruner + Jahr owns

Bertelsmann's remaining operating activities are grouped
under Corporate Investments. Among others, these include
the strategic growth segments of music and education
as well as the club and direct marketing businesses,
which are being phased out. Bertelsmann Digital Media
Investments (BDMI), Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI),
Bertelsmann India Investments (BII), Bertelsmann Brazil
Investments (BBI) and other investments in the growth
regions are also allocated to Corporate Investments.

Regulatory Environment

Bertelsmann has television and radio operations in several
European countries that are subject to regulation. In Germany,
for example, media are subject to oversight by the Com-
mission on Concentration in the Media. Bertelsmann Group
companies occupy leading market positions in many lines of
business and may therefore have limited potential for growth
through acquisition due to antitrust legislation. Moreover,
some education activities are subject to regulatory provisions
of government authorities and accreditation bodies.

As its profit participation certificates and bonds are publicly
listed, Bertelsmann is required to comply in full with capital
market regulations applicable to publicly traded companies.

Shareholder Structure

Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is an unlisted partnership limited
by shares. Three foundations (Bertelsmann Stiftung, Reinhard
Mohn Stiftung and BVG-Stiftung) indirectly hold 80.9 percent of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shares, with the remaining 19.1 percent
held indirectly by the Mohn family. Bertelsmann Verwaltungs-
gesellschaft (BVG) controls all voting rights at the General Meeting
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and Bertelsmann Management SE.

Strategy

Bertelsmann’s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability
(see the “Value-Oriented Management System” section).

Bertelsmann aims to achieve a faster-growing, more digital
and more international Group portfolio. As well as invest-
ments in existing activities, new business segments that pro-
vide a broader overall revenue structure are being increasingly
explored. The further development of the portfolio is subject
to clear investment criteria. Businesses in which Bertelsmann
invests should have long-term stable growth, global reach,
stable and protectable business models, high market-entry
barriers and scalability. The education business is being gradually
developed into the third earnings pillar alongside the media
and service businesses. Group strategy comprises four strate-
gic priorities, which again constituted the key work aspects
for the Executive Board in 2015: strengthening the core busi-
nesses, driving the digital transformation forward, developing
growth platforms and expanding into growth regions.

In the financial year 2015, Bertelsmann made further signifi-
cant progress in implementing its strategy. The core television
business was strengthened by RTL Group expanding its
families of channels and the TV production business. The book
publishing business benefited significantly from the continued
encouraging progress made in the integration of Penguin and
Random House. Gruner + Jahr strengthened and expanded
the magazine portfolio with the successful publication of new
titles and of new editions of existing titles. The restructuring
of Arvato further reinforced the independence of the business
units Customer Relationship Management, Supply Chain
Management, Financial Solutions, IT Solutions and Digital
Marketing. In addition, it was decided to bundle the print
businesses in the newly created Bertelsmann Printing Group,
effective January 1, 2016. The structurally declining busi-
nesses, such as the club and direct marketing businesses,
were scaled back further and the printing companies in Spain
were sold. Furthermore, Bertelsmann continued to implement
a Group-wide earnings improvement program.

The Group also actively pushed forward with the digital trans-
formation. RTL Group continued to expand its online video
offering and also bundled the businesses in the multichannel
networks and digital advertising marketing in the newly
formed RTL Digital Hub. The strategic objective of the RTL
Digital Hub consists of the further development of the existing
digital businesses of RTL Group, the realization of potential


--- Page 4 ---

synergies and the development of investment opportunities.
Penguin Random House remains the global market leader
in the e-book sector. Gruner + Jahr expanded its digital con-
tent and advertising marketing offerings both organically and
through acquisitions. Arvato enhanced its services for digital
businesses, particularly in the e-commerce segment.

The growth platforms were reinforced in the education seg-
ment through the expansion of the Relias Learning business,
increasing the share of the online learning provider Udacity
and the acquisition of participations in the online educa-
tion platform HotChalk and Alliant International University.
Moreover, Bertelsmann bundled its education activities in the
Bertelsmann Education Group, which became an independent
division effective January 1, 2016. RTL Group's production sub-
sidiary Fremantle Media acquired several production compa-
nies, including the Italian production company Wildside. The
music company BMG, which has been managed as an inde-
pendent division effective January 1, 2016, also expanded its
business through further signings and catalog acquisitions.
Arvato strengthened the Financial Solutions division through an
investment in the Brazilian financial services provider Intervalor.

Bertelsmann achieved progress in all three growth regions in
which it is primarily active. In China, the Bertelsmann Asia
Investments (BAI) fund made further investments in a large
number of startups and increased the value of the invest-
ment portfolio. In Brazil, Bertelsmann purchased shares in the
online learning provider Affero Lab and the financial services
provider Intervalor. In India, the group made follow-up invest-
ments in the online furniture marketplace Pepperfry and in the
music streaming service Saavn.

Bertelsmann will push ahead with its transformation into a
faster-growing, more digital and more international Group in
2016 in line with the four strategic priorities. Compliance with
and achievement of the strategic development priorities are
continuously examined by the Executive Board at divisional
level through regular meetings of the Strategy and Business
Committee and as part of the annual Strategic Planning
Dialogue between the Executive Board and the Supervisory
Board. In addition, relevant markets and the competitive
environment are analyzed on an ongoing basis in order to
draw conclusions concerning the further development of the
Group's strategy. The Executive Board is also supported by the
Group Management Committee (GMC) on issues of corporate
strategy and development. This Committee is composed of
executives representing key businesses, countries, regions
and selected Group-wide functions.

The Group's content-based and entrepreneurial creativity will
remain very important for the implementation of its strategy.
Bertelsmann will therefore continue to invest significantly in
the creative core of the businesses. In addition, Bertelsmann
needs to have qualified employees at all levels of the Group
to ensure its strategic and financial success. Innovation com-
petence is also very important for Bertelsmann and is a key
strategic component (see the “Innovations” section).

Value-Oriented Management System

Bertelsmann’s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability.
In order to manage the Group, Bertelsmann has been using
a value-oriented management system for many years, which
focuses on revenues, operating earnings and optimum capital
investment. For formal reasons, Bertelsmann makes a distinc-
tion between strictly defined and broadly defined operational
performance indicators.

Strictly defined operational performance indicators, including
revenues, operating EBITDA and Bertelsmann Value Added
(BVA), are used to directly assess current business perfor-
mance and are correspondingly used in the outlook. These are
distinguished from performance indicators used in the broader
sense, which are partially derived from the above-mentioned
indicators or are strongly influenced by these. These include
the EBITDA margin and the cash conversion rate. The financial
management system, with defined internal financing targets,
is also part of the broadly defined value-oriented management
system. Details of the expected development of performance
indicators used in the broader sense are provided as addi-
tional information and are not included in the outlook.

Strictly Defined Operational Performance Indicators

In order to control and manage the Group, Bertelsmann uses
revenues, operating EBITDA and BVA as performance indica-
tors. Revenue is used as a growth indicator of businesses. In
the financial year 2015, Group revenues rose 2.8 percent to
€17.1 billion (previous year: €16.7 billion). Operating EBITDA
is determined as earnings before interest, tax, deprecia-
tion and amortization and is adjusted for special items. This
makes it a meaningful performance indicator for determin-
ing the sustainable operating result. Operating EBITDA
increased to €2,485 million (previous year: €2,374 million) in
the reporting period.

Bertelsmann uses BVA for assessing the profitability of opera-
tions and return on invested capital. BVA measures the profit
realized above and beyond the appropriate return on invested
capital. This form of value orientation is reflected in strate-
gic investment, portfolio planning and the management of
Group operations and, together with qualitative criteria, forms
the basis for measuring the variable portion of management
compensation. BVA is calculated as the difference between
net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) and the cost of capital.
NOPAT is calculated on the basis of operating EBITDA. NOPAT
is determined by firstly deducting depreciation, amortization
and impairment losses and adjusting for special items. After
subsequent modifications and deduction of a flat 33 percent
tax, the resulting figure is the NOPAT. Cost of capital is the
product of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and
the level of capital invested. The uniform WACC after taxes is
8 percent. Invested capital is calculated on the basis of the
Group's operating assets less non-interest-bearing operating
liabilities. The net present value of operating leases is also
taken into account when calculating the invested capital. BVA
in the financial year 2015 reduced to €155 million compared
with the previous year's figure of €188 million. This develop-
ment stems in particular from the acquisitions made in the
reporting period, particularly in the education businesses of
Corporate Investments, as well as from the first-time inclusion
for the full year of the transactions from the previous year,
which resulted in an increase in invested capital. The com-
pensating effects of earnings contributions from the acquired
businesses are only expected to materialize in subsequent
years as a result of their growth profile. The BVA at RTL Group

8 Financial Information Combined Management Report

was slightly down on the previous year. The BVA increase at
Penguin Random House is primarily attributable to the strong
improvement in the operating result. The BVA of Gruner + Jahr
was reduced by a lower earnings contribution in the reporting
period. The BVA of Arvato increased. At Be Printers, the BVA
improved and again made a positive contribution as a result of
a further decline in invested capital.

Broadly Defined Performance Indicators

In order to assess business development, other performance
indicators are used that are partially derived from revenues and
operating EBITDA or are strongly influenced by these figures.

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash gener-
ated from business activities and is calculated as the ratio of
operating free cash flow to operating EBIT. Operating free cash
flow does not reflect interest, tax or dividend payments to non-
controlling interests, is lowered by operating investments such
as replacement and expansion investments as well as changes
in working capital, and is adjusted for special items. The Group
aims to maintain a cash conversion rate of 90 to 100 percent as
a long-term average. The cash conversion rate in the financial
year 2015 was 83 percent (previous year: 97 percent).

The EBITDA margin is calculated as the ratio of operating
EBITDA to revenues, which is used as an additional criterion
for assessing the business performance. In the financial
year 2015, the EBITDA margin of 14.5 percent was above the
previous year’s high level of 14.2 percent.

Bertelsmann’s financial management and controlling sys-
tem is defined by the internal financial targets outlined in the
“Net Assets and Financial Position” section. These financing
principles are pursued in the management of the Group and
are included in the broadly defined value-oriented manage-
ment system.

The non-financial performance indicators (employees, corporate
responsibility and innovations) are not included in the broadly
defined value-oriented management system. As they can only
be measured to a limited extent, it is not possible to make
any clear quantifiable statements concerning interrelated
effects and value increases. For this reason, the non-financial
performance indicators are not used for the management of
the Group.

Non-Financial Performance Indicators
Employees

At the end of the financial year 2015, the Group had
117,249 employees worldwide. In 2015, there were 1,217 people
serving in trainee positions in Bertelsmann companies in
Germany.

The human resources (HR) strategy was revised and pri-
oritized as part of establishing the Human Resources Board
department. In 2015, the main focus was on the further
development and training of employees. This included a com-
prehensive adaptation of the central talent management pro-
cesses and tools as well as the establishment of talent pools.

Continuous employee training is vital to a company’s eco-
nomic success. In view of this, the training courses offered by
Bertelsmann University have been optimized and expanded.
For example, Bertelsmann globally integrated the online
video courses offered by the international e-learning provider
lynda.com into the Group-wide HR IT platform “peoplenet”
and accordingly offers training to over 64,000 employees in
13 countries.

At Bertelsmann, partnership primarily involves working with
the employees to shape the company. This means supporting
dialogue between the employee representatives and dialogue
with the Bertelsmann management. At the Group Dialogue
Conference in March 2015, the works councils of all Bertelsmann
companies in Germany jointly discussed various key topics. In
addition, the German corporate representatives for disabled

employees held their annual meeting to exchange experiences.
The key topic of “health,” which was presented at these events,
was addressed in depth in ongoing discussions between the
Corporate Works Council and the Bertelsmann Executive Board
throughout the year and supplemented by specific measures.
For example, comprehensive minimum standards on the topic
of health were agreed upon at Bertelsmann.

Bertelsmann has been one of the pioneers in profit shar-
ing since 1970. Thus, a total of €85 million (previous year:
€101 million) was distributed to employees worldwide in 2015
thanks to the positive operating results for the previous year.

Corporate Responsibility

The aim of corporate responsibility (CR) at Bertelsmann is to
bring the economic interests into line with the social and eco-
logical interests within the Group as part of a dialogue with all
relevant stakeholders.

In March 2015, there was a meeting of the Bertelsmann
Corporate Responsibility Council, which promotes interdi-
visional exchange on CR topics and helps to address these
topics within the divisions. In its work in 2015, the Council
focused on the strategic development of key CR topics.

2015 also saw the publication of Bertelsmann’s fourth annual
carbon footprint report. This report is based on a global col-
lection of environmental data from Group companies that
together represent around 82 percent of Group employees
and 73 percent of Group revenues. Bertelsmann has
managed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 36 percent
compared to the previous data collection for 2012. This
reduction is mainly attributable to printing operations that were
sold but also to the increasing digitization of the businesses
and improvements in energy efficiency.

The fifth international Bertelsmann “be green Day” also took
place in 2015, an initiative focusing on increasing employees’
awareness of environmental issues and improving the envi-
ronmental performance at individual locations. In 2015,
around 60 Bertelsmann company locations took part.

Innovations

Businesses invest in research on and development of new
products in order to ensure their long-term competitiveness.
The media sector has a similar imperative to create innova-
tive media content and media-related products and services

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2015 9


--- Page 7 ---

in a rapidly changing environment. This means that rather
than conventional research and development activities, the
company’s own innovative power is particularly important to
Bertelsmann. The long-term success of the Group depends
heavily on product innovations, investing in growth markets
and integrating new technologies. Furthermore, innovative
expertise is very important for strategy implementation and,
in the future, will be anchored even more strongly within the
Bertelsmann Group in organizational terms.

Bertelsmann relies on innovation and growth in core opera-
tions and new business fields. The key factors of Bertelsmann’s
innovation management include continuously following
cross-industry trends and observing new markets. At Group
level, Bertelsmann works with the divisions to continuously
identify and implement innovative business strategies. Along-
side market-oriented activities, support is given to Group-wide
initiatives that actively promote knowledge transfer and col-
laboration. At regular innovation forums, executives meet
with internal and external experts to examine success factors
for innovation and creativity.

RTL Group's innovation management is focused on three
core topics: developing and acquiring new, high-quality
TV content and formats; using all digital means of distribution;
and expanding diverse forms of advertising sales and mon-
etization. In 2015, Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland formed a
partnership with NBC Universal and TF1 for the co-production
of US-style TV series with procedurals. RTL Group also
expanded its position in the aggregation and monetization of
online videos and invested in the US startups Clypd, which
develops technologies for programmatic advertising sales
in linear TV, and VideoAmp, which develops new marketing
solutions for cross-device data analysis. Fremantle Media
established digital studios and produced original online video
content, e.g., for StyleHaul or individual YouTube channels
such as Buzzr. Synergy Committees are used for exchanging
information and knowledge within RTL Group.

The world’s largest trade publisher Penguin Random House
benefits from its scale and reach as well as from the creative
and innovative potential of its publishing and sales teams
which together manage over 15,000 new titles per year. In dig-
ital, the company is introducing new applications, enhanced
e-books and so-called verticals to bring together communities
of readers around shared interests. One such vertical which
has already been launched successfully in the United States

10 Financial Information Combined Management Report

is the book recommendation platform Brightly, which can
help parents to instill a lifelong interest in reading in their
children. Likewise in the United States, the company increased
the number of e-mail subscribers to its book and author news-
letter by 43 percent compared to 2014. The aim of these and
other activities is to establish a direct link to the readers.

In 2015, Gruner + Jahr made rapid progress with its print
offensive and launched a total of eight new magazines and
five special publications. In addition, seven titles within the
G+J portfolio underwent a comprehensive relaunch. G+J also
invested in its digital businesses and further expanded its
portfolio with acquisitions such as the German e-commerce
provider for gift ideas Danato and the food platform Delinero,
as well as the careers portal Employour in conjunction with
Medienfabrik, which moved from Arvato to Gruner + Jahr
on January 1, 2016. In June 2015, G+J became the exclu-
sive partner of the Dutch online kiosk provider Blendle in
Germany. Gruner + Jahr is launching an innovation lab called
Greenhouse, which will quickly examine the feasibility and
prospects for success of business ideas. Gruner + Jahr also
provided a total of €50 million of investment funds and media
services for early investment in innovative digital companies.

In the financial year 2015, there was an organizational restruc-
turing of Arvato under a new leadership structure. In this new
structure, the responsibility for the development and marketing
of innovative service solutions in the Customer Relationship
Management, Supply Chain Management, Financial Solutions,
Digital Marketing and IT Solutions segments lies with the
individual Arvato business units. Arvato is increasing its inno-
vative power by developing innovative solutions and technol-
ogies, acquiring innovative technology providers and service
companies, and increasing cooperation with research insti-
tutes and innovation partners.

The innovations at Be Printers relate primarily to technology
optimization and product innovations. A range of measures
were introduced to achieve greater energy efficiency, for
example improving the exhaust air systems at Prinovis. One
example of product innovation is a project for Sony in the
United States. It is part of a new, multi-year contract which
was signed in 2015. Under this contract, US printing compa-
nies also produced covers and components for vinyl records
and CDs, thus developing another new segment outside
traditional book printing.

Report on Economic Position

Corporate Environment
Overall Economic Developments

In 2015, the global economy continued to expand at a moder-
ate and uneven pace. The growth of the real gross domestic
product (GDP) fell slightly to 3.1 percent compared with a
rise of 3.4 percent in 2014. This is mainly attributable to weak
growth in the emerging markets. By contrast, the economic
situation in the developed economies was robust.

In the eurozone, the economy improved somewhat and
showed an increase in real GDP of 1.5 percent, from 0.9 percent
in the same period in the previous year. In particular, the
accommodative monetary policy of the European Central
Bank strengthened domestic demand while exports suffered
from a slowdown in global trading.

The German economy continued its economic recovery in the
reporting period. Real GDP grew by 1.7 percent compared to
1.6 percent in the previous year. In France, too, the economy
posted an upward trend once more. Real GDP growth was
1.2 percent in 2015 compared with 0.2 percent in 2014. In the
UK, economic activity slowed somewhat, with an increase in
real GDP of 2.4 percent compared to a rise of 3.0 percent in
the previous year.

The US economy picked up again over the course of the year
after a poor start. Overall, real GDP increased by 2.4 percent in
2015 compared with a rise of 2.4 percent in 2014.

Developments in Relevant Markets

The following analysis focuses on markets and regions of a
sufficient size if their trend can be adequately aggregated and
if they are strategically important from a Group perspective.

Overall, the European TV advertising markets grew in 2015. The
TV advertising markets in Germany and Hungary showed mod-
erate growth, while the TV advertising markets in France, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Croatia were stable or posted slight
growth. The TV advertising market in Spain grew once more.

Sales of printed books in the United States saw moderate
growth, while publishing sales of e-books fell sharply as a result
of changes to sales conditions. The market for printed books in

the UK grew significantly. The German- and Spanish-language
book markets showed largely stable development.

The magazine markets in Germany and France in 2015 were
characterized by significantly declining print advertising busi-
ness and moderately declining circulation business, while the
digital business posted strong growth.

As a result of the trend toward outsourcing, the Arvato busi-
nesses for Customer Relationship Management, Supply Chain
Management, Financial Solutions, IT Solutions and Digital
Marketing enjoyed moderate to significant growth.

Overall, the relevant European print markets declined in 2015,
while the offset market showed far more stable development
than the gravure printing market. The North American book
printing market saw a moderate decline.

The global music publishing markets showed slight growth,
while the markets for recorded music stabilized, having been
in decline for a number of years.

As expected, the education markets in the United States grew
strongly in 2015 in the market segments where Bertelsmann
is involved — namely, healthcare and technology, online ser-
vices and university education.

Significant Events in the Financial Year

Effective January 1, 2015, the Board-level human resources
function was established. Immanuel Hermreck was appointed to
the Bertelsmann Executive Board with responsibility for this area.

In April 2015, Bertelsmann placed two hybrid bonds with a
total volume of €1.25 billion. Both subordinated bonds, each
with a term of 60 years and with initial redemption options
of eight and twelve years, respectively, increase the financial
flexibility of Bertelsmann in view of the Group’s ongoing stra-
tegic transformation. In November 2015, Bertelsmann issued
a unilateral waiver in respect of the exercise of a specific
extraordinary right of termination.

On May 5, 2015, the General Meeting of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA elected Gigi Levy-Weiss to the company’s
Supervisory Board. Hartmut Ostrowski and Lars Rebien
Sorensen left the Board.

On July 9, 2015, the Bertelsmann Supervisory Board appointed
Fernando Carro de Prada to the Bertelsmann Executive Board
as CEO of Arvato. He succeeded Achim Berg, who left the
Bertelsmann Executive Board. The appointment is related to
the further development of the Arvato division. Streamlining
the management structures and tightening up the decision-
making and reporting processes strengthen entrepreneurial
independence and operational agility.

In November 2015, Bertelsmann invested further in the expan-
sion of its education activities and significantly increased its
investment in the innovative online learning provider Udacity.

In December 2015, Bertelsmann expanded the strategic
growth area of education and invested in the online educa-
tion platform HotChalk. With a total transaction volume of
€179 million, Bertelsmann is the largest shareholder.

On December 18, 2015, Bertelsmann took over the remaining
25.1 percent of printing group Prinovis from former co-partner
Axel Springer. The full takeover of the company is intended to
simplify the corporate structures.

Results of Operations

The following analysis of earnings performance relates to con-
tinuing operations as of December 31, 2015. Please refer to
the “Performance of the Group Divisions” section for a more
detailed picture of the earnings situation.

Revenue Development

Group revenues increased by 2.8 percent to €17.1 billion in
the financial year 2015. Besides an exchange rate-related
increase, growth was also boosted by successful business
development of the German TV activities, digital businesses of
RTL Group and Gruner + Jahr as well as a number of Arvato’s
service businesses. The continued expansion of BMG and the
development of the education business also had a positive
impact. This was primarily offset by the continued scaling
back of structurally declining businesses. The Group achieved
organic growth of 0.4 percent, adjusted for portfolio and
exchange rate effects. Exchange rate effects amounted to
4.2 percent and portfolio effects to -1.8 percent.

12 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Revenues at RTL Group rose 3.8 percent to €6,029 million in
2015 (previous year: €5,808 million). The positive performance
was largely attributable to Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland,
positive exchange rate effects and the further expansion of digi-
tal activities. Year on year, revenues at Penguin Random House
increased by 11.8 percent to €3,717 million (previous year:
€3,324 million), mainly as a result of positive exchange rate
effects and higher printed book sales. Gruner + Jahr’s reve-
nues were down 12.0 percent to €1,538 million (previous year:
€1,747 million) due to divestments and the continuing decline
in the advertising and circulation markets. At €4,847 million,
Arvato's revenues were up 4.0 percent year on year (previous
year: €4,662 million). Arvato was able to expand existing cus-
tomer relationships in the Customer Relationship Management
and Financial Solutions segments in particular and gain new
customers. Revenues at Be Printers were down 25.5 percent
to €742 million (previous year: €996 million) due to the sale
of various operations, falling print circulations and price pres-
sure. Corporate Investments performed very well overall,
helped in particular by the ongoing expansion of BMG and
the expansion of the education business. Revenues increased
by 22.4 percent to €624 million (previous year: €510 million).

The geographical revenue distribution was more diversified
compared to the previous year. Against the background of
positive exchange rate effects for existing operations and
the continued development of new businesses in the United
States, particularly in education, the European revenue
share declined overall. The share of revenues generated in
Germany was 33.9 percent compared with 35.2 percent in
the previous year. The revenue share generated by France
amounted to 13.2 percent (previous year: 14.2 percent). In
the UK, the revenue share was 6.7 percent (previous year:
6.4 percent). The share of total revenues generated by the
other European countries amounted to 17.7 percent com-
pared with 18.4 percent in the previous year. The revenue
share generated by the United States increased to 21.6 per-
cent (previous year: 18.6 percent), and the other countries
achieved a revenue share of 6.9 percent (previous year:
7.2 percent). This means that the share of total revenues
generated by foreign business was 66.1 percent (previous
year: 64.8 percent). Year on year, there was a slight change
in the ratio of the four revenue streams (own products and
merchandise, advertising, services, rights and licenses) to
overall revenue.

The revenue share generated by the growth businesses
increased to 28 percent overall (previous year: 25 percent)
thanks to organic growth and acquisitions, while the revenue
share of structurally declining businesses minimized to
5 percent overall (previous year: 8 percent) as a result of
disposals and scaling back. The growth businesses comprise
those activities which post continuous revenue increases
thanks to sustained positive market factors and which have
been identified as growth priorities as part of Group strategy.
These include the digital businesses of RTL Group and of
Gruner + Jahr, the TV production business, the music business,
the service businesses in the SCM, Financial Solutions and
IT Solutions segments, as well as the education business
and the fund activities. The structurally declining businesses
comprise those activities which post sustained revenue losses
due to market factors. These include in particular the gravure
printing activities, the storage media replication business and
the club and direct marketing business.

Operating EBITDA

Bertelsmann achieved an increase in operating EBITDA
to €2,485 million in the financial year 2015 (previous year:
€2,374 million). The operating EBIT as well as revenues ben-
efited from positive exchange rate effects. Furthermore, as
part of the implementation of the transformation and growth
strategy, the share of structurally declining businesses generat-
ing low earnings was reduced and the Group-wide earnings
improvement program was further implemented. In particu-
lar, the American book publishing business and the German
TV business delivered a good earnings performance. This was
counteracted by start-up losses for new businesses and the
costs of the ongoing Group transformation. The EBITDA mar-
gin of 14.5 percent was above the high level of 14.2 percent in
the previous year.

Operating EBITDA of RTL Group increased to €1,355 million
(previous year: €1,334 million). A good earnings performance
at Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland was contrasted in par-
ticular by lower earnings contributions at Fremantle Media.
Penguin Random House achieved a significant increase in
operating EBITDA to €557 million (previous year: €452 million)
thanks to positive exchange rate effects and cost savings as
part of the integration. Operating EBITDA at Gruner + Jahr
fell to €128 million (previous year: €166 million). This stems

primarily from lower revenues in the German and international
advertising business as well as start-up losses for new busi-
nesses and for the transformation to digital. Arvato achieved an
operating EBITDA of €394 million (previous year: €384 million).
The growth in earnings is attributable to the CRM and SCM
segments. This was offset by burdens in the IT Solutions and
Print Solutions segments. Operating EBITDA at Be Printers
declined to €47 million (previous year: €64 million) as a result
of the general decline in the print business and disposals. At
Corporate Investments, operating EBITDA nearly doubled
from €44 million to €80 million. The significant increase mainly
results from organic growth and growth through acquisitions
in the music and education segments.

Special Items

Special items normalized in the financial year 2015. The pre-
vious year's figure included one-time high burdens from an
impairment on RTL Group's TV operations in Hungary as well
as restructuring expenses, impairments and losses on disposal
as part of the scaling back of the print businesses and of the
club and direct marketing businesses. In the reporting period,
Penguin Random House posted lower integration costs year on
year. The value of some of the participations in the education
business was increased based on transactions, thus compen-
sating for the burdens compared to the previous year.


--- Page 12 ---

Special items in the financial year 2015 totaled €-191 million
(previous year: €-619 million). They consist of impairments
and reversals on impairments totaling €-40 million (previ-
ous year: €-101 million), fair value remeasurement of invest-
ments of €82 million (previous year: €24 million), proceeds
from sales of participations totaling €24 million (previous year:
€-155 million) as well as restructuring expenses and other spe-
cial items totaling €-257 million (previous year: €-340 million).
In the reporting period, there were no adjustments to carrying
amounts on assets held for sale, compared to €-47 million in
the previous year.

EBIT

Adjusting operating EBITDA for special items totaling
€-191 million (previous year: €-619 million) and the amortiza-
tion, depreciation, impairments and reversals of impairments
on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment totaling
€-613 million (previous year: €-606 million), which were not
included in special items, EBIT amounted to €1,681 million
in the financial year 2015 (previous year: €1,149 million)
The increase compared to the previous year's figure is pri-
marily attributable to the lower overall charges related to
special items.

Group Profit or Loss

The financial result increased by €65 million to €-230 million
year on year. The increase in interest expenses due to the issue
of bonds in the reporting period was more than compensated
for by the positive deviation in other financial expenses. The
previous year’s figure included burdens from the full take-
over of Gruner + Jahr. The income tax expense amounted to
€-346 million (previous year: €-286 million). The year-on-year
deviation is partly attributable to the use of tax loss carry-
forwards realized in the previous year. This produced after-tax
earnings from continuing operations of €1,105 million (previous
year: €568 million). Taking into account the after-tax earnings
from discontinued operations of €3 million (previous year:
€4 million), this resulted in a Group profit of €1,108 million
(previous year: €572 million). The increase compared to the
previous year's figure is attributable to the positive operat-
ing EBITDA development and lower overall charges related
to special items. The share of Group profit held by non-
controlling interests came to €431 million (previous year:
€410 million). The share of Group profit held by Bertelsmann
shareholders was €677 million (previous year: €162 million).
At the Annual General Meeting of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA, an unchanged year-on-year dividend payout of
€180 million will be proposed for the financial year 2015
(previous year: €180 million).

Net Assets and Financial Position
Financing Guidelines

The primary objective of Bertelsmann’s financial policy is to
achieve a balance between financial security, return on equity
and growth. For this, Bertelsmann bases its financing policy
on the requirements of a “Baa1/BBB+” credit rating and the
associated qualitative and quantitative criteria. Credit ratings
and capital market transparency make a considerable contri-
bution to the company’s financial security and independence.

In accordance with the Group structure, the capital allocation
is made centrally by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, which
provides the Group companies with liquidity and manages
the issuance of guarantees and letters of comfort for them.
The Group consists largely of a single financial unit, thereby
optimizing capital procurement and investment opportunities.

Bertelsmann utilizes a financial control system employing
quantitative financial targets concerning the Group's eco-
nomic debt and, to a lesser extent, its capital structure. One
of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor calculated
as the ratio of economic debt to operating EBITDA and limited
to the defined maximum of 2.5. In determining the leverage
factor, the hybrid bonds are accounted for at 50 percent. Eco-
nomic debt is defined as net financial debt less the 50 percent
par value component of the hybrid bonds plus provisions for
pensions, profit participation capital and the net present value
of operating leases. Like operating EBITDA, economic debt is
modified for calculation purposes.

As of December 31, 2015, the leverage factor of Bertelsmann
was 2.4, below the previous year’s value and below its self-
imposed maximum value of 2.5 (December 31, 2014: 2.7).
As of December 31, 2015, economic debt was reduced
to €5,609 million from €6,039 million in the previous year.
This reduction was primarily achieved through the hybrid
bonds issued in the reporting period which are allocated at
only 50 percent to economic debt. The net financial debt
increased to €2,765 million (previous year: €1,689 million).
The increase is mainly attributable to a voluntary contribution
of €650 million to the plan assets held under the trusteeship
of Bertelsmann Pension Trust e.V. as part of the inclusion of
Gruner + Jahr and Prinovis. Consequently, the pension provi-
sions and similar obligations were reduced and amounted to
€1,709 million as of December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014:
€2,698 million).

Another financial target is the coverage ratio. This is cal-
culated as the ratio of operating EBITDA (after modifica-
tions) to financial result and is supposed to be above 4.

1) After modifications.

In the reporting period, the coverage ratio was 10.1 (previous
year: 7.5). The Group's equity ratio was 41.2 percent
(December 31, 2014: 38.9 percent), which remains signifi-
cantly above the self-imposed minimum of 25 percent.

Financing Activities

In the reporting period, the financial profile of the Group was
strengthened through the issuance of two hybrid bonds with
a total volume of €1.25 billion. The subordinated bonds with a
term of 60 years were issued by Bertelsmann in two tranches
with early redemption options. The first tranche has a volume
of €650 million, carries a coupon of 3.0 percent and contains
an early redemption option for the first time after eight years.
The second tranche has a volume of €600 million, carries a
coupon of 3.5 percent and contains an early redemption
option for the first time after 12 years. The bonds listed in
Luxembourg were rated by the rating agencies Moody’s and
Standard & Poor's (S&P) with instrument ratings of “Baa3”
and “BBB-," respectively. Both bonds are classified by the
rating agencies as 50 percent equity and thus improve the
financial key figures which are relevant for Bertelsmann’s credit

rating. In October, a bond was repaid from existing liquidity
when it became due. In addition, on December 1, 2015,
Bertelsmann took out a promissory note in the amount of
€100 million with a five-year term and a promissory note in
the amount of €150 million with a ten-year term.

Rating

Bertelsmann has been rated by the rating agencies Moody's
and Standard & Poor's (S&P) since 2002. The agency ratings
facilitate access to the international capital markets and are
therefore a key element of Bertelsmann’s financial security.
Bertelsmann is rated by Moody's as “Baa1” (outlook: stable)
and by S&P as “BBB+” (outlook: stable). Both credit ratings
are in the investment-grade category and meet Bertelsmann’s
target rating. Bertelsmann’s short-term credit quality rating is
“P-2" from Moody's and “A-2” from S&P.

Credit Facilities

As well as its existing liquidity, the Bertelsmann Group has
access to liquidity via a syndicated loan with a term until 2020.

This forms the backbone of the strategic credit reserve;
Bertelsmann can utilize this to draw down up to €1.2 billion
of revolving funds in euros, US dollars and pounds sterling.

Cash Flow Statement

In the reporting period, Bertelsmann generated net cash
from operating activities of €1,600 million (previous year:
€1,523 million). The Group’s long-term operating free cash
flow adjusted for non-recurring items was €1,559 million
(previous year: €1,711 million). The deviation compared to the
previous year’s figure is attributable, among other things, to a
higher overall level of net working capital. Higher burdens also
result from the investments in operating non-current assets.
The cash conversion rate was 83 percent (previous year:
97 percent). The cash flow from investing activities was
€-1,785 million (previous year: €-1,523 million). This included

investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equip-
ment and financial assets of €-1,093 million (previous year:

€-166 million (previous year: €-820 million). Proceeds from
the sale of subsidiaries and other business units and disposal
of other non-current assets were €163 million (previous
year: €90 million). Cash flow from financing activities was
€-122 million (previous year: €-1,434 million). The deviation
is primarily attributable to inflows from the issuance of hybrid
bonds in the reporting period. Dividends paid to the share-
holders of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA came to €-180 million
(previous year: €-180 million). Dividends to non-controlling
interests and further payments to partners in partnerships
came to €-450 million (previous year: €-585 million). As of
December 31, 2015, Bertelsmann had cash and cash equiva-
lents of €1.3 billion (previous year: €1.3 billion).

Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities

The off-balance-sheet liabilities include contingent liabili-
ties and other financial commitments, almost all of which
result from operating activities conducted by the divisions.
Off-balance-sheet liabilities increased year on year. The off-
balance-sheet liabilities in place as of December 31, 2015,
had no significant negative effects on the Group’s net assets,
financial position and results of operation for the past or the
future financial year.

Investments

Total investments including financial debt acquired of
€41 million (previous year: €62 million) amounted to
€1,281 million in the financial year 2015 (previous year:
€1,601 million). Investments according to the cash flow
statement amounted to €1,259 million (previous year:
€1,578 million). As in previous years, the majority of the
€297 million investment in property, plant and equipment
(previous year: €334 million) stemmed from Arvato. Invest-
ments in intangible assets came to €349 million (previous year:
€248 million) and were primarily attributable to RTL Group
for investments in film rights and to BMG for the acquisition
of music catalogs. The sum of €447 million was invested in
financial assets (previous year: €176 million). These include, in
particular, the acquisition of shares in HotChalk and Udacity.
Purchase prices for consolidated investments (less acquired
cash and cash equivalents) totaled €166 million in the report-
ing period (previous year: €820 million).

Balance Sheet

Total assets increased to €22.9 billion as of December 31, 2015
(previous year: €21.6 billion). Cash and cash equivalents
of €1.3 billion were at the previous year's level (previous
year: €1.3 billion). Equity increased to €9.4 billion as of
December 31, 2015 (previous year: €8.4 billion). This stems
primarily from the increase in retained earnings as a result of
the significantly increased Group profit in the reporting period.
As a result of the higher equity, the equity ratio also increased
from 38.9 percent in the previous year to 41.2 percent.
Equity attributable to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA share-
holders increased to €7.5 billion (previous year: €6.5 billion).
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased
to €1,709 million (previous year: €2,698 million), largely as
a result of a voluntary contribution to the plan assets held

under the trusteeship of Bertelsmann Pension Trust e. V. and
an interest-based decline in obligations from benefit commit-
ments. Gross financial debt increased from €3,018 million
to €4,075 million as of December 31, 2015, due to the
taking up of long-term debt reported in the section “Financing
Activities.” Apart from that, the balance sheet structure
remained largely unchanged from the previous year.

Profit participation capital had a par value of €301 million as
of December 31, 2015, which is unchanged from the previous
year. If the effective interest method is applied, the carrying
amount of profit participation capital was €413 million as of
December 31, 2015 (previous year: €413 million). The 2001
profit participation certificates (ISIN DE0005229942) account
for 94 percent of par value of profit participation capital, while
the 1992 profit participation certificates (ISIN DE0005229900)
account for the remaining 6 percent.

The 2001 profit participation certificates are officially listed
for trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange. Their price is listed as a percentage of par value.
The lowest closing rate of the 2001 profit participation certifi-
cates in the financial year 2015 was 296.00 percent in June;
their highest was 357.50 percent in April.

Under the terms and conditions of the 2001 profit participation
certificates, the payout for each full financial year is 15 percent
of par value, subject to the availability of sufficient Group
profit as well as net income at the level of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA. These conditions were met in the past financial
year. Accordingly, a payout of 15 percent of the notional value
of the 2001 profit participation certificates will be made for the
financial year 2015.

The 1992 profit participation certificates, approved for trad-
ing on the Regulated Market in Frankfurt, only have a limited
cash trade due to their low volume. Payouts on the 1992 profit
participation certificates are based on the Group's return on
total assets. As the return on total assets for the financial year
2015 was 6.99 percent (previous year: 4.93 percent), the pay-
out on the 1992 profit participation certificates for the financial
year 2015 will be 7.99 percent of their notional value (previous
year: 5.93 percent).

The payout distribution date for both profit participation cer-
tificates is expected to be May 10, 2016. Under the terms and
conditions of the profit participation certificates, the auditors
appointed by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA are responsible for
verifying whether amounts to be distributed have been calcu-
lated correctly. The auditors of both profit participation certifi-
cates provide confirmation of this.

Performance of the Group Divisions
RTL Group

Europe's leading entertainment network recorded a positive
performance in 2015, increasing both its revenues and oper-
ating profit. RTL Group's revenues increased by 3.8 percent
to €6.0 billion (previous year: €5.8 billion), mainly due to
the encouraging development of the European advertising
markets, the strong expansion of the digital business, and
positive exchange rate effects. Operating EBITDA increased
by 1.6 percent to €1.4 billion (previous year: €1.3 billion) in the
reporting period. Significantly higher earnings contributions
from Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland and RTL Hungary more
than offset declines in Fremantle Media’s content production
business. The EBITDA margin was 22.5 percent (previous
year: 23.0 percent). RTL Group employed 12,258 people at
year-end.

The European TV advertising markets that RTL Group
operates in all grew or remained stable in 2015. Germany in
particular recorded growth, with Mediengruppe RTL outper-
forming the market. Both revenues and earnings once again
reached record levels, driven among other things by increas-
ing advertising revenues and a growing distribution busi-
ness. The flagship channel, RTL Television, remained the clear
market leader in the primary target group, despite a slight
decline in viewer numbers.

Groupe M6 in France saw a moderate decline in revenues and
a slightly lower operating EBITDA, against the background of
the sale of the e-commerce platform Mistergooddeal in the
previous year and lower revenues from the home shopping
business. The broadcasting group was able to increase its
audience share overall. In the Netherlands, RTL Nederland
achieved higher revenues partly thanks to growing distribution
revenues; the operating result remained stable. RTL Nederland
further consolidated its clear lead among viewers.

The production arm Fremantle Media increased its revenues
primarily due to positive exchange rate effects. The operating
result was down, partly due to a lower earnings contribution
from the “American Idol” format and increased investment in
new formats. The company achieved international successes
with series like “Deutschland 83,” which was produced for
RTL Television, sold in the United States during the year under
review, and subsequently in numerous other countries.

RTL Group continued to invest in its three strategic mainstays
of business — broadcast, content and digital - and in 2015
launched four new linear TV channels: In March, three
special-interest pay TV channels were launched in Croatia, and
in September, the news channel RTL Z in the Netherlands.
The production business was expanded: Fremantle Media
acquired shares in the production companies Full Fat TV and

20 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Naked Entertainment in Britain, Wildside in Italy, Fontaram
and Kwai in France and No Pictures Please in the Netherlands,
strengthening the company's creative diversity in the scripted,
entertainment and factual genres.

RTL Group's digital revenues increased by 72 percent, soaring
past the €500 million mark; its contribution to total revenues
doubled to eight percent in the reporting period. RTL Group's
various platforms and offers generated 105 billion online
video views — a year-on-year increase of 188 percent. The
companies of the RTL Digital Hub founded in June — especially
BroadbandTV, StyleHaul and SpotX — each significantly
increased their revenues by high double-digit rates.

Penguin Random House
The world’s leading trade book publisher Penguin
Random House significantly increased both its revenue and
operating profit in the financial year 2015. Its revenues
increased 11.8 percent to €3.7 billion (previous year
€3.3 billion) in stable market environments across its ter-
ritories, thanks to positive exchange rate effects. Operating
EBITDA rose sharply by 23.2 percent to €557 million (previous
year: €452 million). Besides the exchange rate effects, this
is attributable to savings from the largely completed inte-
gration of Penguin and Random House, whose businesses
were merged on July 1, 2013, and a strong bestseller lineup.
The EBITDA margin was 15.0 percent (previous year
13.6 percent). The book publishing group, whose shares —
with the exception of the German business, which is
wholly owned by Bertelsmann — are 53 percent owned by
Bertelsmann and 47 percent owned by Pearson, employed
10,582 people at year-end.

Among the year's top performers was Paula Hawkins’s debut
novel “The Girl on the Train,” which sold more than seven
million copies in the English- and German-speaking world
across all Penguin Random House formats — print, e-book
and audiobook. “Grey,” the new E L James novel in the
“Fifty Shades” series, sold 8.5 million copies in English,
German and Spanish. Exceptional bestsellers in children’s
and young adult books included Dr. Seuss titles, which
collectively sold 10.8 million copies, and “Diary of a Wimpy
Kid: Old School” by Jeff Kinney, which sold 1.2 million copies.

In the United States, Penguin Random House publishers
placed 584 print and e-book titles in the “New York Times”
bestseller lists, 79 at number one. Among these were “Rogue
Lawyer” by John Grisham, “The Life-Changing Magic of
Tidying Up” by Marie Kondo and “Between the World and
Me” by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Numerous children’s books did very
well, including “Paper Towns” by John Green, as well as new
fiction by James Dashner and Rick Yancey. Revenues and
earnings were up on the previous year.

Penguin Random House UK grew profitably. Its publishers
placed 211 titles in the “Sunday Times” bestseller lists, 31 at
number one. Here, the most popular books included “Grey”
by E L James and “The Girl on the Train” by Paula Hawkins,
as well as fiction by Harper Lee and Jeff Kinney’s “Diary of a
Wimpy Kid: Old School.”

Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial saw the beginnings
of a recovery amidst the ongoing volatility of the
marketplace in Spain. Latin America also experienced
some growth. Bestsellers included “Hombres buenos” by
Arturo Pérez-Reverte, “El amante japonés” by Isabel Allende
and “El mundo azul” by Albert Espinosa. Meaningful progress

was made on integrating the Spanish- and Portuguese-
language publishing activities of Santillana Ediciones Generales,
which was acquired in 2014.

Verlagsgruppe Random House in Germany increased its
revenues and achieved a record operating result, outper-
forming the market. Its top-selling titles were “Die Betrogene”
by Charlotte Link and “Altes Land” by Dorte Hansen.

Penguin Random House further expanded its digital business
across all markets. However, in the United States, e-book sales
were affected by new retail sales terms. During the reporting
year, the publishing group sold the self-publishing unit Author
Solutions and the Australian online bookseller Bookworld.

Penguin Random House authors won numerous prestigious
awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Biography for “The
Pope and Mussolini” by David |. Kertzer, and the Man Booker
Prize for “A Brief History of Seven Killings” by Marlon James.

Gruner + Jahr

In the financial year 2015, Gruner + Jahr continued its stra-
tegic transformation to a leading house of content. Due to
divestments and the deconsolidation of the businesses in Asia
during the prior period, and the general trend in the ad sales
market, G+J’s revenues declined by 12 percent to €1.54 billion
(previous year: €1.75 billion). In the core markets of Germany
and France, however, revenues from digital activities con-
tinued to increase. As a result of overall declining revenues
and continued high expenditure on expanding the digital
businesses, operating EBITDA declined by 22.9 percent to
€128 million (previous year: €166 million). The EBITDA margin
was 8.3 percent (previous year: 9.5 percent). At the end of the
year, G+J had 13,245 employees.

In November 2015, the decision was made to transfer the
Arvato subsidiary Medienfabrik to Gruner + Jahr with effect
from January 1, 2016, and merge it with G+J Corporate Editors
to create Germany's biggest provider of content communica-
tions. At year-end, G+J acquired the startup Employour, which
specializes in student marketing.

G+J Germany's revenues and earnings were down, reflect-
ing a significant decline in print ad sales. Circulation revenues
were stable, bucking the general market trend, thanks to a
print campaign and adjusted cover prices. G+J invested in the
expansion of its magazine portfolio (“Barbara,” “Brigitte Wir,”
“Stern Crime,” “National Geographic Traveler”) as well as
in digital activities. For instance, the company acquired
the specialized gift ideas e-commerce provider Danato
and fully acquired the food platform Delinero. G+J entered
into a strategic partnership with the Dutch startup Blendle,
and also set aside a total of €50 million in funds and media
services to invest in startups and innovations. In addition, first
projects from the Greenhouse innovation lab were realized.
G+J EMS expanded its position as a premium cross-media
marketer. The company’s growth is partly attributable to inno-
vative native advertising products, i.e., “programmatic” and
word-of-mouth campaigns.

Motor Presse Stuttgart posted lower revenues, mainly due to
the sale of the business in France, but its earnings improved
thanks to cost-cutting measures. The DDV Media Group in
Saxony reported an increase in revenues thanks to higher
proceeds from sales and new businesses that are going
well, but earnings decreased due to the introduction of the
minimum wage.

Revenues in the international business showed some organic
growth in 2015, but declined overall. In France, the G+J
subsidiary Prisma Media increased its revenues slightly,
but its operating EBITDA fell slightly despite a fast-growing
digital business. The video marketer Advideum recorded

22 Financial Information Combined Management Report

a particularly successful development. Activities in Austria
remained below last year’s revenues and earnings figures. The
Austrian press market remained under strong pressure, which
is also reflected in the performance of Verlagsgruppe News,
but the group gained additional market share in the adver-
tising business. Gruner + Jahr’s activities in China declined
markedly, reflecting the reduced growth momentum in the
country; since the end of 2014, Boda’s businesses have only
been consolidated at equity.

Business activities in Spain recorded a clear upward trend in
earnings thanks to cost-cutting measures, and were profitable
again for the first time since 2010. G+J Netherlands recorded
largely stable revenues and earnings. On July 1, 2015, G+J
withdrew from the Italian market due to a lack of strategic
prospects, selling its 50 percent stake in the joint venture
Gruner + Jahr/Mondadori.

In 2015, numerous G+J journalists and authors once again
won awards for their work.

Arvato

The international services provider Arvato recorded moderate
revenue growth and a slight increase in operating profit
for the financial year 2015. Revenues grew both through
acquisitions and organically, by a total of 4.0 percent to
€4.8 billion (previous year: €4.7 billion). Despite macro-
economic challenges in a few markets, and start-up costs for
new projects, operating EBITDA rose by 2.6 percent to
€394 million (previous year: €384 million). The EBITDA margin
was 8.1 percent after 8.2 percent last year. Arvato employed
72,457 people at the end of the year.

In July, Arvato'’s management changed; the division
has since been under the management of a team led by
CEO Fernando Carro. The CEOs of the three major Solution
Groups — Customer Relationship Management (CRM),
Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Financial Solutions —
were each appointed to the Bertelsmann Group Management
Committee (GMC). Arvato’s print and replication businesses
were transferred to the newly founded Bertelsmann Printing
Group with effect from January 1, 2016, and the communica-
tions agency Medienfabrik was transferred to the Bertelsmann
subsidiary Gruner + Jahr. These changes enable Arvato to
focus on its fast-growing services businesses.

The revenues and earnings of the CRM Solution Group rose
significantly during the year. The business continued its trans-
formation from customer phone services toward comprehen-
sive digital communication services. The CRM Solution Group
won important new customers in the healthcare and
IT/Internet sectors.

The SCM Solution Group expanded its existing customer rela-
tionships in Germany and internationally in 2015. Revenues
and earnings were up slightly. Positive impetus came from the
US business, the strategic growth area of e-commerce ser-
vices, and from solutions for the healthcare industry.

The Financial Solutions unit increased its revenues in the
reporting period, while keeping its operating result stable at
a high level. This was supported mainly by a positive busi-
ness performance in Scandinavia and the German-speaking
countries. The acquisition of a 40 percent stake in the Brazilian
financial services provider Intervalor on June 1, 2015, marked
Arvato's successful entry into the Latin American financial
services market.

Demand for the application development and system integra-
tion services provided by the IT Solution Group remained at a
constantly high level in 2015. This performance was obscured
by high set-up costs in a major project and a downturn in the
United States. Revenues for the IT businesses were up, while
earnings fell slightly. In the Digital Marketing Solution Group,

the transformation of existing business was further advanced
in 2015.

Revenues and earnings from Arvato’s print businesses soft-
ened. Meanwhile, additional investments consolidated their
technology leadership. Revenues from storage media replica-
tion declined as expected; Arvato discontinued its replication
activities in the United States at year-end.

Be Printers

Bertelsmann’s European gravure printing activities and inter-
national offset and digital printers, which are pooled in the
Be Printers division, recorded declining revenues and operating
results for the financial year 2015. Be Printers’ revenues
fell by 25.5 percent to €742 million in 2015 (previous year:
€996 million). Operating EBITDA decreased by 26.6 percent
to €47 million (previous year: €64 million). The EBITDA margin
was 6.3 percent after 6.4 percent last year. At the end of the
year, Be Printers employed 3,415 people.

The background to this development was primarily formed by
divestments in Southern Europe and a market-driven opera-
tional downturn in the European gravure printing market. The
technological change toward more offset and digital printing
as well as shorter print runs for magazines, catalogs and print
advertising additionally impacted gravure revenues. At the
same time, existing contracts with major publishers such as
Gruner + Jahr, Axel Springer and Klambt in Europe as well as
with Sony Entertainment in the United States were extended.

In December 2015, Be Printers acquired the remaining
25.1 percent of shares in the Printing Group Prinovis from
its erstwhile partner Axel Springer. The parent company
Bertelsmann subsequently merged its offset and gravure
printing activities at Arvato and Be Printers under the umbrella
of the Bertelsmann Printing Group on January 1, 2016, thereby
creating Europe's biggest printing group. Various smaller
media and services businesses as well as the replication
business were also assigned to the new division.

Be Printers continued to focus on developing its quality and
cost competitiveness in 2015. As part of its concentration on
core markets, the company withdrew from Spain in the period
under review. The Spanish printers Rotocobrhi in Madrid and
Eurohueco in Barcelona were sold to the British print investor
Walstead Capital in April 2015.

The European gravure printing company Prinovis expanded its
range of services to accommodate lower print runs, additional
formats and shorter lead times by putting two offset printing
presses into operation in Dresden. However, due to lower
order volumes overall, Prinovis recorded significant year-on-
year declines in revenues and earnings.

Be Printers’ US printing plants faced declining market prices
in the letterpress segment, but were able to more than
compensate for this by expanding their business into other
sectors with innovative print products.

Corporate Investments/Corporate Center

Corporate Investments, which includes all of Bertelsmann’s
operating activities at Group level, did well in the financial
year 2015, increasing both its revenues and operating result.
Revenues grew by 22.4 percent to €624 million (previous
year: €510 million), and operating EBITDA by 82 percent
to €80 million (previous year: €44 million). The continued
expansion of the music company BMG contributed to this,
as did the expansion of the education business. The EBITDA
margin was 12.8 percent after 8.6 percent in the previous
year. At the end of the year, Corporate Investments had
4,654 employees.

In the reporting period, Bertelsmann made significant prog-
ress in developing its new education business. The company
increased its participation in the online learning provider
Udacity and became the largest shareholder of HotChalk, an
online education platform in the United States. Relias Learning's
market position was strengthened by the acquisition of
the e-learning provider RediLearning. Together with the
Group's other educational businesses, these companies
have been pooled since September in the newly established
Bertelsmann Education Group, which will commence opera-
tions as of January 1, 2016. In Brazil, Bertelsmann acquired
a stake in Affero Lab, a leading B2B provider of corporate
training.

BMG continued to make major strides in developing its
interests in recorded music and audiovisual rights alongside
its music publishing business, acquiring labels including
Rise Records, which specializes in rock and metal, the pop
label S-Curve Records and Atmosphériques in France.
BMG also took over the Verse Music Group and Minder Music
publishing catalogs, and rights in the Buddy Holly catalog
in the United States. Renowned artists who have found a
new home at BMG include Dave Stewart, Janet Jackson,
Silbermond, Katie Melua and Emerson Lake & Palmer. In
China, BMG entered into an extensive digital distribution
agreement with Alibaba. In October, Janet Jackson led the
Billboard Top 200 chart with “Unbreakable,” giving BMG its
first number-one album in the United States.

The BDMI fund, which invests in digital companies mainly
in the United States, and the BAI fund, which specializes in
promising companies in China, acquired several new share-
holdings. In Brazil, Bertelsmann and Bozano Investimentos
jointly set up a new fund that focuses on education compa-
nies, especially in the healthcare sector. In India, the holdings
in Pepperfry, the leading online marketplace for furniture, and
in the music streaming service Saavn were expanded.

Der Club Bertelsmann discontinued its business activities in
the German-speaking countries at year-end as planned.

In 2015, the Corporate Center supported the implementation
of the corporate strategy with its four strategic priorities. In
addition, as part of the Operational Excellence program, the
establishment of a global network of Accounting Shared
Services Centers was agreed upon. Global coordination and
parts of the Group’s Germany-wide accounting services will
largely be handled from Rheda in the future. Another focus
of the Corporate Center was the integration of Arvato’s and
parts of G+J’s administrative functions into the Group's head-
quarters. The establishment of the Central HR Department
reporting to the Executive Board, with a focus on education
and talent management, was also advanced.

General Statement by Company Management
on the Economic Situation

2015 was a successful year for Bertelsmann. The Group
improved its revenues, operating EBITDA and in particular
the Group profit year on year and also exceeded the expecta-
tions stated at the beginning of the year. Bertelsmann also
made significant progress in its strategic transformation into
a faster-growing, more digital and more international Group.

In the reporting period, Group revenues rose 2.8 percent to
€17.1 billion (previous year: €16.7 billion). The revenue devel-
opment was ahead of expectations in particular thanks to the
positive exchange rate effects (outlook in 2014 Annual Report:
stable revenue development/adapted outlook in 2015 Interim
Report: slight increase). Operating EBITDA of €2,485 million
(previous year: €2,374 million) was moderately above the
previous year (outlook in 2014 Annual Report: slight increase/
adapted outlook in 2015 Interim Report: moderate increase).
At €155 million, the BVA used for Group management was
strongly below the previous year’s figure of €188 million
(outlook in 2014 Annual Report: strongly declining BVA). The
expected development reflects the strong increase in average
invested capital, which is primarily due to acquisitions and
exchange rate developments.

Bertelsmann’s four strategic priorities — strengthening the
core businesses, driving the digital transformation forward,
developing growth platforms, and expanding into growth
regions — continued to be the focus. Besides the expan-
sion of the families of channels at RTL Group, the positive
integration of Penguin and Random House and the modern-
ization and expansion of Gruner + Jahr’s magazine portfolio,
it was the restructuring of Arvato and the bundling of the
print businesses in the Bertelsmann Printing Group as of
January 1, 2016, which helped to strengthen the core busi-
nesses. As part of the digital transformation, RTL Group
continued to expand its online video offering and also
bundled the participations in the multichannel networks
and digital advertising marketing in the RTL Digital Hub.
Penguin Random House remains the global market leader
in the e-book sector, and Gruner + Jahr expanded its digital
content and advertising marketing offerings organically and
through acquisitions. The growth platforms were re-
inforced in the education segment — in particular through the
organic and acquisitive expansion of Relias Learning, the
increase in the share of the online education provider
Udacity and the acquisition of participations in the online
education technology provider HotChalk and Alliant
International University — and bundled in the newly established
Bertelsmann Education Group. Bertelsmann also made

26 Financial Information Combined Management Report

progress in China, India and Brazil with investments in a
large number of startups in particular.

The net assets and financial position improved over the last
financial year. In particular, the financial profile was optimized
through the issuance of two hybrid bonds with a total
volume of €1.25 billion. As of December 31, 2015, the cash
and cash equivalents reported at €1.3 billion represent
sufficient liquidity. The ratings agencies Moody's and S&P
continued to rate Bertelsmann as “Baa1” and “BBB+,” respec-
tively, with a stable outlook. Overall, Bertelsmann ended the
financial year 2015 with a successful performance and has a
solid financial basis.

Significant Events After the Balance Sheet Date

Since January 1, 2016, the strategic transformation of the
Bertelsmann Group is reflected even more strongly in the
company structure. From the start of the financial year 2016,
the Group will form three additional independent divisions
from the operating activities of Corporate Investments: BMG,
Bertelsmann Education Group and Bertelsmann Investments.
BMG is an international music business; the Bertelsmann
Education Group comprises the growth businesses and
investments in the education segment; and Bertelsmann
Investments comprises the funds Bertelsmann Digital Media
Investments (BDMI), Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI),
Bertelsmann Brazil Investments (BBI) and Bertelsmann India
Investments (BIl), investing in digital businesses worldwide.
In addition, the Group's offset and gravure printing activities
were combined in the Bertelsmann Printing Group division
as of January 1, 2016. The group comprises the businesses
Mohn Media, GGP Media and Vogel Druck previously
considered part of service subsidiary Arvato, the gravure
activities of Prinovis in Germany and the UK previously
operating under Be Printers, and the offset and digital
printers of Be Printers in the United States. In the future, the
new division will also include individual printing-related
service and production businesses such as the Sonopress
replication business.

At its meeting on January 26, 2016, the Supervisory Board
appointed Bernd Hirsch as the new Bertelsmann Chief
Financial Officer. As of April 1, 2016, he will take over the
department from Executive Board Chairman Thomas Rabe
who was performing this function on a transitional basis.

Risks and Opportunities

Risk Management System

The purpose of the Bertelsmann risk management system
(RMS) is the early identification and evaluation of, as well as
response to, internal and external risks. The internal control
system (ICS), an integral component of the RMS, monitors
the effectiveness of the risk response measures that have
been implemented. The aim of the RMS is to identify, at an
early stage, material risks to the Group so that risk response
measures can be taken and controls implemented. Risks are
possible future developments or events that could result in a
negative deviation from outlook or objective for Bertelsmann.
In addition, risks can negatively affect the achievement of
the Group’s strategic, operational, reporting and compliance-
related objectives.

The risk management process is based on the internationally
accepted frameworks of the Committee of Sponsoring Orga-
nizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO Enterprise Risk
Management - Integrated Framework and Internal Control —
Integrated Framework, respectively) and is organized in sub-
processes of identification, assessment, response, control,
communication and monitoring. A major element of risk
identification is a risk inventory that lists significant risks
year by year, from the profit center level upward. It is then
aggregated step by step at the division and Group levels. This
ensures that risks are registered where their impact would
be felt. There is also a Group-wide reassessment of critical
risks every six months and quarterly reporting in case the risk
situation has changed. Ad hoc reporting requirements ensure
that significant changes in the risk situation during the course
of the year are brought to the attention of the Executive Board.
The risks are compared against risk response and control
measures to determine the so-called net risk. Both one-
year and three-year risk assessment horizons are applied
to enable the timely implementation of risk response mea-
sures. The basis for determining the main Group risks is
the three-year period, similar to medium-term corporate
planning. Risk assessment is the product of the estimated
negative impact on Group free cash flow should the risk
occur and the estimated probability of occurrence. Risk
monitoring is conducted by Group management on an
ongoing basis. The RMS, along with its component ICS, is
constantly undergoing further development and is inte-
grated into ongoing reporting to the Bertelsmann Executive
Board and Supervisory Board. Corporate and Divisional Risk
Management Committee meetings are convened at regular
intervals to ensure compliance with statutory and internal
requirements.

The auditors inspect the risk early-warning system for its
capacity to identify developments early on that could threaten
the existence of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA according to
section 91 (2) of Germany's Stock Corporation Act (AktG),
then report their findings to the Supervisory Board. Corporate
Audit conducts ongoing reviews of the adequacy and func-
tional capability of the RMS in the Penguin Random House,
Gruner + Jahr, Arvato and Be Printers as well as the Corporate
Investments and Corporate Center segments. RTL Group’s risk
management system is evaluated by the respective internal
auditing department and by the external auditor. Any issues
that are identified are promptly remedied through appropri-
ate measures. The Bertelsmann Executive Board defined the
scope and focus of the RMS based on the specific circum-
stances of the company. However, even an appropriately
designed and functional RMS cannot guarantee with absolute
certainty that risks will be identified and controlled.

Accounting-Related Risk Management System and Internal
Control System

The objectives of the accounting-related RMS and ICS are to
ensure that external and internal accounting is proper and reli-
able in accordance with applicable laws and that information
is made available without delay. Reporting should also present
a true and fair view of Bertelsmann’s net assets, financial posi-
tion and results of operation. The following statements pertain
to the Group financial statements (including the “Notes to the
Group Financial Statements” and “Combined Management
Report” sections), interim reporting and internal management
reporting.

The ICS for the accounting process consists of the following
areas. The Group’s internal rules for accounting and the prepa-
ration of financial statements (e.g., IFRS manual, guidelines
and circulars) are made available without delay to all employ-
ees involved in the accounting process. The Group financial
statements are prepared in a reporting system that is uniform
throughout the Group. Extensive automatic system controls
ensure the consistency of the data in the financial statements.
The system is subject to ongoing development through a
documented change process. Systematized processes for
coordinating intercompany transactions serve to prepare
the corresponding consolidation steps. Circumstances that
could lead to significant misinformation in the Group financial
statements are monitored centrally by employees of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and by RTL Group (for the pre-
consolidated subgroup), then verified by external experts as
required. Central contact persons from Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA and the divisions are also in continuous contact

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2015 27


--- Page 25 ---

with local subsidiaries to ensure IFRS-compliant accounting
as well as compliance with reporting deadlines and obliga-
tions. These preventive measures are supplemented by spe-
cific controls in the form of analyses by the Corporate Financial
Reporting department of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and
RTL Group (for the preconsolidated subgroup). The purpose
of such analyses is to identify any remaining inconsistencies.
The controlling departments on Group and division level are
also integrated into the internal management reporting. Inter-
nal and external reporting are reconciled during the quarterly
segment reconciliation process. The further aim in introduc-
ing a globally binding control framework for the decentralized
accounting processes is to achieve a standardized ICS format
at the level of the local accounting departments of all fully con-
solidated Group companies. The findings of the external audi-
tors, Corporate Audit and the internal auditing department of
RTL Group are promptly discussed with the affected compa-
nies and solutions are developed. An annual self-assessment
is conducted to establish reporting on the quality of the ICS in
the key Group companies. The findings are discussed in Audit
and Finance Committee meetings at the divisional level. Like
the RMS, each ICS cannot guarantee with absolute certainty
that significant misinformation in the accounting process can
be prevented or identified.

Corporate Audit and the internal auditing department of
RTL Group evaluate the accounting-related processes as part
of their auditing work. As part of the auditing process, the
Group auditor also reports to the Audit and Finance Committee
of the Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board about

any significant vulnerabilities of the accounting-related ICS
that were identified during the audit and the findings regard-
ing the risk early-warning system.

Major Risks to the Group

Bertelsmann is exposed to a variety of risks. The major risks to
Bertelsmann identified in the risk reporting are listed in order
of priority in the table below. In line with the level of possible
financial loss, the risks are classified as low, moderate, sig-
nificant, considerable or endangering, for the purposes of risk
tolerability. The risk inventory carried out did not identify any
risks that would be classified as considerable or endangering.

Given the diversity of the businesses in which Bertelsmann is
active and the corresponding diversity of risks to which the
various divisions are exposed, the key strategic and opera-
tional risks to the Group identified below are broken down
by business segment. Risks from acquisitions and informa-
tion security risks were identified as the primary risks and are
therefore described separately. This is followed by an outline
of legal and regulatory risks and financial market risks. These
risks are largely managed at the corporate level.

Strategic and Operational Risks

In 2015, the global economy continued to expand in a modest
and uneven way. In 2016, the global economy is expected to
remain on a moderate and uneven growth path. In view of the
recent deterioration in the global economic outlook and the

ongoing uncertainty in the markets, Bertelsmann’s business
development is still subject to risks. Assuming a continuing
normalization of the overall economic situation, Bertelsmann
expects positive development of Group revenues for 2016. In
the short to medium term, in addition to the risk associated
with economic development, other significant Group risks
include pricing and discounting risks, customer risks, supplier
relationship risks, and loss of audience and market share as
well as risks from changes in the market environment. How
these risks develop depends, among other things, to a large
extent on changes in customer behavior due to factors such
as the continued digitization of media, the development and
implementation of products and services by new or existing
competitors, and bad debt losses, as well as default and interfer-
ence along the production chains in individual sectors, such
as IT. Financial market risks, employee-related risks and legal
and regulatory risks are moderate risks for Bertelsmann, while
risks from future technological changes in the three-year
period under review are classified as low.

The following presentation of the risks relates to the seg-
ment structure and portfolio composition at the end of the
financial year 2015. In the future, as a result of the revised
reporting structure effective January 1, 2016, including the
newly created Bertelsmann Printing Group and the future
independent divisions of BMG, Bertelsmann Education Group
and Bertelsmann Investments, possible risks will be allocated
differently in organizational terms but without changing the
overall risk profile from a Group perspective.

The ongoing digitization is resulting in an increasing fragmen-
tation of RTL Group's markets as audiences will have more
choice (for example through online platforms) and, at the
same time, the market-entry barriers are being lowered. The
possible risks of this for RTL Group are decreasing audience and
advertising market shares of its advertising-financed channels
and therefore, ultimately, lower revenues. In order to counter
these risks, RTL Group is continuously revising and developing
the channels and program strategies — for example, by estab-
lishing complementary families of channels and constantly
adapting these to international program trends. RTL Group
is addressing the risks associated with digitization and is
actively helping to shape this trend through a range of invest-
ments in the fast-growing online video advertising market.
Increasing competition in the area of program acquisition
and TV production as well as the growing dependence on
individual production companies, coupled with the risk of
potential cost increases, could also impact RTL Group’s ability
to generate revenues. This risk is being reduced by expanding
the program share of own productions and signing long-term

contracts with major content providers. Furthermore,
economic development directly impacts the TV advertis-
ing markets and therefore RTL Group’s revenue. This risk is
being countered by focusing on developing non-advertising
revenue streams, e.g., distribution revenues from platform
operators. To reduce the risk of customer losses, active
customer relationship management is established.

Falling e-book sales constitute one risk for Penguin
Random House, triggered in particular by changes to the
sales conditions for e-books. A further risk is the trend
toward consolidation in bricks-and-mortar book retail which
is being seen in the reduction of retail space for books or
even branch closures. Penguin Random House is countering
these risks by introducing differentiated pricing, employing
additional advertising measures and continuously examining
alternative marketing options. Any risk of bad debt loss is
being limited through debtor management and in some cases
through credit insurance. In addition, Penguin Random House
is finding itself exposed to the risk of cost increases. There
are also risks from the general economic uncertainty which
could lead to lower sales. Management controls these risks
through careful management of supplier relationships and by
maintaining a flexible cost structure that allows for a quick
response in the event of an economic downturn. Risks from
the integration of Penguin and Random House have fallen
significantly as the integration has essentially been completed.

For Gruner + Jahr, besides the risk of a deterioration of the
overall market environment and the resulting declines in
advertising and circulation revenues, supplier risks represent
significant challenges. A changing market environment in
which price pressure and declining revenues as a result of
further concentration in the agency market and more aggres-
sive advertising conditions on the part of competitors cannot
be ruled out may lead to falling margins. Furthermore, there
is the risk of losing key customers as advertising customers
could switch to other media, notably digital media. The risks
are being countered by active cost and customer manage-
ment, the development of new, including digital, forms of
offerings as well as product, price and quality improvements.
Through association work, the Group is responding to the
advertising restrictions discussed at EU level (e.g., car adver-
tising) which could lead to declining advertising revenues.

Arvato sees itself as particularly exposed to risks from cus-
tomer and supplier relationships as well as risks from a chang-
ing market environment. The potential loss of key customers
is being countered through contracts offering comprehensive
service packages with simultaneously flexible cost structures.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2015 29


--- Page 27 ---

On the supplier side, key risks include the quality of goods and
services purchased as well as the procurement costs if the
increase cannot be passed on to the customers. As a result
of a simultaneous increase in dependency on a few suppliers,
margin pressure is increasing in a number of segments.
Countermeasures include entering into long-term contracts,
an active exchange with existing suppliers and monitoring the
supplier market. Competition is intensifying because compet-
itors are following Arvato's strategy and expanding their
value chains. At the same time, new competitors entering the
market could intensify the competitive pressure and lead
to lower margins. By developing the range of services, the
aim is to improve the competitive position and to increase
customer loyalty through integrated solutions. A worsening of
the economic environment could result in declining revenues
and thus lower margins, which would necessitate cost-cutting
measures and capacity downsizing. Broad diversification
across customers, sectors and regions helps to reduce this
risk. Digitization entails further risks for individual customer
segments of Arvato, particularly in physical product distri-
bution. These risks are being addressed, for example, by
developing digital services. Furthermore, business segments
that offer no strategic or economic prospects are being
deliberately scaled back.

For Be Printers, customer risks, in particular greater depen-
dence on a few major customers, are the most significant
risks. The aim is to minimize the risks by taking out credit
insurance, utilizing active debtor management and entering
into more flexible customer contracts. Furthermore, deteriora-
tion in the economic environment also may lead to declining
circulations with a negative impact on earnings. There are
further risks on the supplier side associated with rising raw
material prices — particularly for paper — that cannot be passed
on to customers and with the quality of the raw materials
purchased. In addition, price and margin pressures result from
a market environment which is characterized by overcapac-
ity as well as existing trends toward consolidation. Similarly,
the increasing use of digital media is accelerating the decline
in circulations. These risk minimization strategies are based,
in particular, on constantly optimizing cost structures and
making them more flexible, as well as using price adjustment
clauses and ongoing market monitoring.

Corporate Investments mainly comprises the strategic growth
segments of BMG and the Bertelsmann Education Group as
well as the fund activities. Risks that affect BMG primarily
concern the business structure (including currency risks and
customer relations), corporate growth (including acquisitions
and integrations) and the profitable scalability of the company

30 Financial Information Combined Management Report

(including technical platform and organization). Market risks
are addressed through high revenue diversification (clients/
catalogs, segments, regions) as well as currency hedging
(hedging of royalty liabilities in foreign currencies) and contrac-
tual protection clauses (hedging the recouping of advances).
Operational risks are countered through process and resource
bundling, control mechanisms and continuous optimization
of the IT platform. The Bertelsmann Education Group is
exposed to risks as a result of the competition with other online
providers, particularly in the US healthcare segment, which is
being addressed through strategic, and in some cases exclu-
sive, partnerships. The key risks for the fund activities consist
of falling market-value indicators or a lack of exit opportuni-
ties. These risks are being addressed through suitable invest-
ment processes and continuous monitoring. From a Group
perspective, the identified risks for Corporate Investments are
of minor importance for the three-year period under review.

The increasing pace of change in the markets and in
Bertelsmann’s business segments means that employees
will need to be more willing and able to adapt in the future.
There are also continuing demographic risks which impact the
recruitment, development and retention of talent as a result
of shifts in the age distribution of the workforce. To counteract
this, employees are being offered further individual education,
comprehensive health programs, a competitive salary and
flexible working models. Bertelsmann is also extending its
recruitment measures and making it easier for employees to
switch jobs within the Group by harmonizing processes and
structures.

Acquisition-Related Risks

The Group strategy focuses on acquisitions of businesses as
well as organic growth. The risk of potential mistakes when
selecting investments and the allocation of investment funds
is limited by means of strict investment criteria and processes.
Acquisitions present opportunities as well as risks. For exam-
ple, integration into the Group requires one-time costs that are
usually offset by increased benefits in the long term thanks to
synergy effects. The risks here are that the integration costs
may be higher than expected or the predicted level of syner-
gies may not materialize. The integration processes are there-
fore being monitored by management on an ongoing basis.

Information Security Risks
For a global media company like Bertelsmann, the reliability

and security of information technology is crucial and can
often give the company a competitive edge. The ability to


--- Page 28 ---

provide and process information in a timely, comprehensive,
error-free and confidential way is crucial to Bertelsmann’s
success. Challenges arise, on the one hand, from the many
non-standardized internal processes as well as from external
potential risks such as cyber attacks, which are still increas-
ing dramatically in the market and competitive environment.
The use of cloud-based IT solutions and the significant growth
of mobile solutions present further challenges. Bertelsmann
has responded to the stricter regulatory conditions with the
information security management system (ISMS, based on
industry standard ISO 27001) which was introduced across
the Group in 2014. The ISMS includes regular and structured
monitoring of compliance with the regulations as well as sys-
tematic recording of information security risks and deriving
appropriate mitigation measures.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Bertelsmann, with its worldwide operations, is exposed to a
variety of legal and regulatory risks ranging from litigation to
varying interpretations of tax-assessment criteria. Bertelsmann
has television and radio operations in several European coun-
tries that are subject to regulation. In Germany, for example,
media are subject to oversight by the Commission on Concen-
tration in the Media. Bertelsmann Group companies occupy
leading market positions in many lines of business and may
therefore have limited potential for growth through acquisition
due to antitrust legislation. Moreover, the education activities
are subject to regulatory provisions of government authorities
and accreditation bodies. These risks are being continuously
monitored by the relevant divisions within the Group.

In November 2008, RTL II filed legal actions against
IP Deutschland, a wholly owned subsidiary of RTL Group, and
Seven One Media (“SOM”) as a result of the 2007 proceed-
ings of the German Federal Cartel Office against the discount
scheme agreements (“share deals”) offered by IP Deutschland
and SOM. RTL II's claim is currently limited to access to infor-
mation, on the basis of which the claimants want to prove
that they suffered damages from these discount schemes.
The court of first instance in Dusseldorf decided to order an
expert report. Similar proceedings of other smaller broadcast-
ers initiated in different courts were unsuccessful or have
been withdrawn.

Foreign investments in the People’s Republic of China are highly
regulated. In view of this, in order to secure Bertelsmann’s
rights it is standard market practice to invest through so-called
VIE structures by means of trust vehicles. However, there is
the risk that it will not be possible to safeguard such vehicles

through Chinese courts if the People’s Republic changes
its policies toward foreign investments or if courts and
authorities change their case law or administrative practice.
Currently, a draft of a revised “PRC Foreign Investment Law” is
being discussed politically. To what extent Chinese investment
policy will change as a result of this will not be apparent until
the end of 2016 at the earliest. The current draft stipulates a
wide-reaching ban on trust structures in regulated markets.
However, there is also no provision whatsoever for dealing
with existing trust structures. In an extreme case it is conceiv-
able that the total investment could be lost. In the past, how-
ever, such measures have only been reported in exceptional
cases. By contrast, observers are anticipating solutions that
will only have a minor impact on the Chinese economy. These
developments would affect BMG, Arvato, Gruner + Jahr and
Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI).

Aside from the matters outlined above, no further significant
legal and regulatory risks to Bertelsmann are apparent at this
time.

Financial Market Risks

As an international corporation, Bertelsmann is exposed to
various forms of financial market risk, especially interest rate
and currency risks. These risks are largely controlled by the
Central Financial Department on the basis of guidelines estab-
lished by the Executive Board. Derivative financial instruments
are used solely for hedging purposes. Bertelsmann uses cur-
rency derivatives mainly to hedge recorded and future transac-
tions involving foreign currency risk. Some firm commitments
denominated in foreign currency are partially hedged when
they are made, with the hedged amount increasing over time.
A number of subsidiaries are based outside the eurozone.
The resulting translation risk is managed based on eco-
nomic debt in relation to operating EBITDA (leverage factor).
Bertelsmann’s long-term focus is on the maximum leverage
factor permitted for the Group. Foreign currency translation
risks arising from net investments in foreign entities are not
hedged. The cash flow risk from interest rate changes is cen-
trally monitored and controlled as part of interest rate man-
agement. The aim is to achieve a balanced ratio of different
fixed interest rates through the selection of appropriate matu-
rity periods for the originated financial assets and liabilities
affecting liquidity and through the ongoing use of interest rate
derivatives. Liquidity risk is monitored on an ongoing basis
with reference to the budget for current and future years. The
syndicated loan and appropriate liquidity provisions form a
sufficient risk buffer for unplanned payments. Counterparty
risks exist in the Group in an amount equivalent to the invested

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2015 31


--- Page 29 ---

cash and cash equivalents and in the default of a counterparty
in derivatives transactions. Financial transactions and financial
instruments are restricted to a rigidly defined group of banks
with a high credit rating (Investment Grade). Within the guide-
lines a risk limit specified by the Bertelsmann Executive Board
has been issued for financial assets and derivatives for each
counterparty. Compliance with this limit is regularly moni-
tored by the Central Financial Department. The guidelines
concerning the investment of cash and cash equivalents are
continuously monitored and if necessary extended. The finan-
cial investments are generally made on a short-term basis so
that the investment volume can be reduced if the credit rating
changes. The financial market risks are estimated as moderate.

Overall Risk

The overall risk position is slightly below the previous year's
level. Overall, the top ten Group risks have not changed
significantly compared to the previous year. While the integra-
tion risk at Penguin Random House no longer constitutes a
key Group risk thanks to the largely completed integration,
continuing technological changes and digitization are creat-
ing challenges for all divisions. In particular, pricing and dis-
counting risks, customer and supplier relationship risks and a
changing market environment still constitute the key Group
challenges. However, as a result of the diversification of Group
businesses, there are no concentration risks stemming from
dependency on individual business partners or products in
either procurement or sales. The Group’s financial position
is solid, with liquidity needs covered by existing liquidity and
available credit facilities.

No risks endangering Bertelsmann’s continued existence
were identified in the financial year 2015, nor are any substan-
tial risks discernible from the current perspective that could
threaten the continued existence of the Group in the future.

Opportunity Management System

An efficient opportunity management system enables
Bertelsmann to secure its corporate success in the long term
and to exploit potential in an optimum way. Opportunities are
possible future developments or events that could result in a
positive deviation from outlook or objective for Bertelsmann.
The opportunity management system, like the RMS, is an inte-
gral component of the business processes and company deci-
sions. During the strategy and planning process, significant
opportunities are determined each year from the profit center
level upward, and then aggregated step by step at the division
and Group levels. By systematically recording them on several

32 Financial Information Combined Management Report

reporting levels, opportunities that arise can be identified and
exploited at an early stage. This also creates an interdivisional
overview of Bertelsmann’s current opportunities. A review of
major changes in opportunities is conducted at the divisional
level every six months. In addition, the largely decentralized
opportunity management system is coordinated by central
departments in the Group in order to derive synergies through
targeted cooperation in the individual divisions. The inter-
divisional experience transfer is reinforced by regular meetings
of the Group Management Committee.

Opportunities

While the above-mentioned opportunities associated with
positive development may be accompanied by corresponding
risks, certain risks are entered into in order to be able to exploit
potential opportunities. This link to the key Group risks offers
strategic, operational, legal, regulatory and financial opportu-
nities for Bertelsmann.

Strategic opportunities can be derived primarily from the
Group’s four strategic priorities. Strengthening core busi-
nesses, driving forward the digital transformation, developing
growth platforms and expanding in growth regions consti-
tute the most important long-term growth opportunities for
Bertelsmann (see the “Strategy” section). In particular, there
are general opportunities for exploiting synergies as a result
of the portfolio expansions. There is potential for efficiency
improvements in the individual divisions and individual opera-
tional opportunities in addition to the possibility of more favor-
able economic development.

For RTL Group, a better-than-expected development of the
TV advertising markets and higher audience and advertising
market shares are major opportunities. Furthermore, the
increasing digitization and fragmentation of the media land-
scape is opening up opportunities. Professionally produced
content can be distributed across multiple platforms nationally
and internationally. New revenue streams could be generated
by exploiting existing TV content across different platforms
and by creating native digital content. Also, with an increased
presence in the digital sector, RTL Group could increase online
video advertising sales on all devices and TV platforms and
establish pay models in the on-demand business. In this way,
new advertising sales could be generated through the offering
of new interactive or targeted forms of advertising (HbbTV,
IPTV or mobile television). As an established content producer
with a global presence, RTL Group could further expand its
digital distribution through multichannel networks and digital
streaming platforms.

The combination of Penguin and Random House has enhanced
the publishing opportunities for Penguin Random House.
With market share gains, the publishing group could further
increase its leading market position, attract new authors and
publish even more bestselling debut publications. As the
world’s largest trade book publisher, Penguin Random House
also has the opportunity to invest more heavily than its com-
petitors. Especially in emerging and multilingual markets, the
publishing group could take advantage of the fast-growing
demand and offer its products to the widest possible reader-
ship. Further acquisitions could also offer significant oppor-
tunities for growth. In this context, Penguin Random House
could also generate greater synergies through the integration
of the acquired businesses. The increasing digitization of
the book markets offers opportunities for new product
development and more efficient marketing channels. The
development of new products and enhancements to exist-
ing offerings could make books more appealing to a wider
audience and offer new experiences to readers. Moreover,
building networks and tools could help authors to connect
better with their readers.

For Gruner + Jahr, a better development of the advertising
and sales markets represents significant opportunities. The
transformation from magazine publisher to a house of con-
tent is providing further opportunities. The structure of G+J
Germany introduced in 2014 integrates the printing and digital
businesses, thus allowing it to implement product innova-
tions faster and more efficiently. Besides the expansion and
development of existing media brands, there are opportunities
for growth, particularly in the development and expansion of
digital activities and in cooperation with other publishers.
There are also opportunities for developing additional
services, such as commerce and paid services. In terms of
marketing, G+J could gain new customers through new forms
of advertising in the online, mobile and video media channels.
Developing new special advertising formats and implement-
ing integrated campaigns could also help to attract potential
new customers.

The restructuring of Arvato implemented in July 2015 enables
better exploitation of growth potential. Under the new
management structure, the Arvato business units will in the
future be able to act independently and flexibly and be able
to respond more quickly to market conditions. The global
responsibility of the individual Solution Groups can provide
additional opportunities for acquiring new customers, partic-
ularly key international customers. There are potential busi-
ness opportunities, primarily in the Financial Solutions and
E-Commerce business segments. The global e-commerce

market will continue its dynamic growth over the next few
years as a result of ongoing digitization. Arvato could benefit
significantly from this growth, primarily through the services
offered by the Solutions Groups SCM and Financial Solutions.
A further growth opportunity from the digital transformation
lies in providing support to customers with CRM solutions via
multiple digital channels.

The Be Printers print businesses may decline less steeply
through additional volumes of existing and new customers.
This would provide opportunities from the targeted servicing
of market segments that are still growing. Moreover, the
prospect of further consolidation of the printing market
could effectively strengthen Be Printers’ market position.

Corporate Investments comprises the growth platforms BMG
and the Bertelsmann Education Group as well as various
fund activities and the club and direct marketing businesses.
Further takeovers of music catalogs and additional signings
of contracts with artists, which could be managed on the
existing platform at marginal cost, offer growth opportunities
for BMG. The rapid market acceptance of streaming and
subscription offers also provides the opportunity to imple-
ment more legal digital offers in an international framework
(including emerging markets). The education business
is to be developed into Bertelsmann’s third earnings pillar
alongside media and service businesses. Entry into rapidly
growing markets and online education offerings focusing
on the healthcare and technology segments offers further
growth opportunities. The education business could benefit
from a faster shift away from traditional classroom-based
tuition toward online and skill-based training as well as an
increasing demand for training in the healthcare and tech-
nology segments. Relias Learning offers additional organic
growth potential through the expansion of the business
to the related healthcare segments and through inter-
national expansion. The participation in Udacity benefits
from the short lifespan of knowledge and content in the
technology sector which will ensure a high repetitive
training requirement. This and the shortage of qualified IT
staff give Udacity the opportunity to build up a premium
brand in the IT/technology training sector. The range of
services offered by HotChalk is targeted at the growing
number of universities which require support in the imple-
mentation of online programs as a result of the growing
acceptance of online training offerings. For fund activities,
there is the opportunity to realize higher-than-expected
profits thanks to increasing market-value indicators. In the
club and direct marketing businesses, lower restructuring
and closure costs could boost business performance.

The current innovation efforts detailed in the “Innovations”
section offer further potential opportunities for the individual
divisions.

Other opportunities could arise from changes to the legal and
regulatory environment.

The financial opportunities are largely based on a favor-
able development of interest and exchange rates from
Bertelsmann’s point of view.

Outlook

Anticipated Overall Economic Development

Bertelsmann anticipates that economic conditions will
develop as follows in 2016. Overall, the global economy will
remain on a moderate and uneven growth path. The Kiel
Institute for the World Economy (IfW) estimates that global
production will increase by 3.4 percent in 2016. The pros-
pects for the advanced economies will be boosted by the
low oil prices and the continuing favorable financing con-
ditions. By contrast, structural barriers and macroeconomic
imbalances will dampen the growth perspectives in the
emerging countries. The global economic outlook has also
noticeably deteriorated recently. Uncertainty on the markets
has increased, particularly due to a significant slowdown of
the Chinese economy.

In the eurozone, the economic recovery is set to continue
even if downward risks remain. The IfW estimates real eco-
nomic growth of 1.7 percent in 2016. The IfW expects GDP
for Germany to grow by 2.2 percent in real terms. It expects
the growth rate in France to be 1.2 percent in real terms. For
the UK, GDP is expected to rise by 2.3 percent in real terms
in 2016. In the United States, the positive growth trend is
expected to continue in 2016; the IfW expects the economy
to grow by 2.8 percent in real terms.

Anticipated Development in Relevant Markets
The worldwide media industry is primarily influenced by
global economic developments and the resulting growth

dynamic. The continued trend toward digitization of content
and distribution channels, changes in media usage and the

34 Financial Information Combined Management Report

increasing influence of emerging economies will continue
to present risks and opportunities in the years to come.
Through the intended transformation of the Group portfolio
in line with the four strategic priorities, Bertelsmann expects
to benefit to an increasing extent from the resulting oppor-
tunities. Through its businesses, Bertelsmann operates in
a variety of different markets and regions whose develop-
ments are subject to a range of factors and which do not
respond in a linear fashion to overall economic tendencies.
The following takes into account only those markets and
regions which are large enough to be relevant for forecasting
purposes and whose expected development can be appro-
priately aggregated and evaluated or which are strategically
important from a Group perspective.

For 2016, slight growth is expected in most of the European
TV advertising markets. In Spain, significant growth is
expected. On the book markets, the trends observed in 2015
are expected to be less pronounced in view of the changes to
sales conditions in the e-book segment and an overall stable
development. In the magazine business, the print advertising
and circulation markets in Germany and France are expected
to decline further in 2016, while continued strong growth is
expected in the digital segment. In 2016, the services markets
are expected to achieve growth similar to the previous year. The
relevant European print markets and the North American book
printing market are likely to show continued decline in 2016.
In 2016, the global music publishing market is forecast to
show continued slight growth. The recorded music market
is expected to show a stable development. For the US edu-
cation markets, continuing strong growth is expected in the
relevant segments.

Expected Business Development

The global economy is on a moderate and uneven growth
path. However, economic prospects continue to be dogged by
certain risks. The following expectations are therefore based
on the assumption that the recovery of the overall economic
situation will continue and that most of the forecasted market
developments and the economic predictions of the research
institutions will be realized.

For the financial year 2016, Bertelsmann anticipates that
business development will be driven by the slightly positive
market expectations for the European TV advertising

markets, particularly in Spain, by stable book markets and
by continuously growing service markets. The growth stimuli
created through strategic portfolio expansions will continue
to have a positive impact on Bertelsmann’s growth profile.
The accelerated scaling back of structurally declining
businesses — in particular, print, replication, clubs and direct
marketing — will also help to mitigate their negative impact.

In addition to the assumed market developments, the
predicted economic developments in the geographic core
markets of Western Europe and the United States are the
basis of the expected business development. With revenue
and earnings share within the eurozone still expected to
remain at around 75 percent, the extent of growth is above
all based on the forecasted real and nominal economic devel-
opment in this economic zone. The IfW therefore assumes
that GDP in the eurozone will increase by 2.9 percent in
nominal terms and by 1.7 percent in real terms for 2016.
The OECD predicts that GDP in the eurozone will increase by
2.8 percent in nominal terms and by 1.8 percent in real terms
for 2016. In view of these economic expectations and the
dampening effects on growth from the continued scaling back
of structurally declining businesses, Bertelsmann expects
Group revenues to increase slightly in the financial year 2016.
Operating EBITDA is expected to show stable development in
the financial year 2016, as start-up losses for new businesses
and the digital transformation of existing businesses will
continue to increase. As a result of the full-year inclusion of
the acquisitions made in the reporting period, Bertelsmann
anticipates that invested capital will increase again in the
financial year 2016. As a result of the growth profile of the
acquired businesses, compensating effects from earnings
contributions are not expected to materialize for some time.
Consequently, a strong fall in BVA is expected for the Group.
Arvato, on the other hand, expects a strong increase in BVA
as a result of improved operating earnings.

At present, the expected performance of any individual unit of
key significance for the Bertelsmann Group is not expected to
deviate significantly from that of the Group.

Depending on how the economy develops, Bertelsmann does
not currently anticipate interest rate changes to have any
material impact on the average financing costs of medium-
to long-term financing. The liquidity situation in the forecast
period is expected to be sufficient.

These forecasts are based on Bertelsmann’s current business
strategy as outlined in the “Corporate Profile” section and
which is valid for the forecast period in the financial year 2016.
The changes to the segment structure as of January 1, 2016,
in particular at Arvato, Gruner + Jahr and Bertelsmann
Printing Group, and the expansion of the segments do not
affect the forecast from a Group perspective. In general, the
forecasts reflect careful consideration of risks and opportunities
and are based on operational planning and the medium-term
outlook for the corporate divisions. All statements concern-
ing potential economic and business developments represent
opinions advanced on the basis of the information that is cur-
rently available. Should underlying assumptions fail to apply
and/or further risks arise, actual results may differ from those
expected. Accordingly, no assurances can be provided con-
cerning the accuracy of such statements.

Results of Operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

Income from participations for Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
fell to €815 million in the reporting period (previous year:
€899 million). The reduction is primarily attributable to the
result of Reinhard Mohn GmbH, with which a profit and loss
transfer agreement exists. In the financial year just ended,
the result of Reinhard Mohn GmbH of €-146 million (previous
year: €26 million) was characterized in particular by
write-downs on share values of a subsidiary.

The increase in other operating income is mainly attributable
to a write-up on shares in Bertelsmann Inc., Wilmington
recognized in the amount of €143 million. The other operating
expenses mainly consist of expenses for property rental
and maintenance, consulting costs and risks from Group
receivables, and were characterized by exchange rate losses
in the reporting period. The financial result fell to €-203 million
from €-130 million in the previous year. The deviation is primar-
ily attributable to depreciation on financial assets, includ-
ing a write-down of €74 million on shares in Prinovis GmbH
and a write-down of €13 million on shares in Bertelsmann
Portuguesa, SGPS, Lda, as well as to the interest income which
has increased as a result of the bonds issued.

The profit from ordinary activities fell to €570 million (previous
year: €577 million). After deduction of tax totaling €-32 million
(previous year: €-69 million), the remaining net income came
to €538 million (previous year: €422 million). The previous

year was burdened by an extraordinary loss of €-86 million,
resulting from a debt waiver in respect of the subsidiary
Societa Holding Industriale di Grafica S.p.A., Bergamo.
Taking into account the retained profits of €304 million carried
forward from the previous year, and after the appropriation
of €260 million to revenue reserves, net retained profits totaled
€582 million (previous year: €484 million).

Net Assets and Financial Position of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA

Tangible and intangible fixed assets increased slightly to
€322 million (previous year: €319 million). The financial assets
increased to €14,356 million (previous year: €13,337 million).
The increase is attributable, among other things, to an increase
of €472 million in the carrying amount of the participation in
Bertelsmann Capital Holding GmbH as a result of payments
made by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA in connection with the
profit and loss transfer agreement between Bertelsmann Capital
Holding GmbH and RTL Group Deutschland GmbH. Furthermore,
long-term securities of €472 million were acquired which are held
and managed by Bertelsmann Pension Trust e.V. They are used
to secure and fulfill pension obligations of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA and selected subsidiaries. Receivables and other
assets are comprised of, in particular, receivables from affili-
ated companies. The year-on-year increase in receivables from
€2,696 million to €3,082 million primarily results from the
performance of the loans to Reinhard Mohn GmbH,
Bertelsmann Inc. and Bertelsmann UK Limited, London.
