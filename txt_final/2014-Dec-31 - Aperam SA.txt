Aperam Annual Report 2

Message from the Chairman of the Board of Directors

March 18, 2015

Dear Shareholders,

Whilst 2014 was another challenging year for the stainless steel industry, Aperam continued to focus
on its own resources to become more resilient to the environment and is now in a stronger financial
position, ready to support its customers with sustainable and high quality stainless steel supply.

Before | go into detail on the global environment and our initiatives, | would first like to update you
on our health and safety results. We continue to make progress, with our lost time injury frequency rate
improving from 1.3 in 2013 to 1.1 in 2014. Zero accidents remain our ultimate goal; more needs to be
done and more will be done.

Although the stainless steel demand continued to grow globally by about 5% in 2014, primarily led
by China, the industry was impacted by the volatility of nickel prices and continued import pressure
from Asia. The price of nickel increased by 50% in the first months of the year as a consequence of
the Indonesian nickel ban and supply shortage fears before declining at year end as the shortage
did not materialize. In Europe, the market was heavily impacted in 2014 by a surge of Asian imports
which continued to increase during the year, leading EUROFER to file anti-dumping and anti subsidy
proceedings to the European Commission.

| am pleased that in this overall challenging and volatile market environment, Aperam succeeded in
further improving its operational efficiency and financial results and reducing its net debt.

In 2014, Aperam delivered EBITDA of $547 million, compared with $292 million throughout 2013
and returned to a positive net income of $95 million compared with a loss of $100 million previous year.
Net debt was $536 million at the end of 2014 compared with $690 million at the end of 2013.These
results were mainly the consequence of Aperam’s strategy to focus on operational efficiency, product
innovation and cash rather than counting on any positive market development.

As part of the main initiatives we launched at the creation of Aperam, was our Leadership Journey®,
a program aimed at improving our competitiveness over the near and medium term. At the end of
2014, the Leadership Journey® had contributed a total amount of $428 million to EBITDA since the
beginning of 2011 and our goal is to achieve $475 million by the end of 2015. Another key initiative is our
Top Line strategy which continues to leverage our unique stainless steel product portfolio and service
differentiation.

Looking forward our focus must remain on the improvement of our operational performance and
balance sheet. In particular, we believe it is a priority to further reduce our debt level in order to come
back to an acceptable level of financial charges and to reach a balance sheet allowing Aperam to be
in a good position to capture any potential opportunity. With this in mind, we will propose at our next
shareholders’ meeting paying no dividend for another year.

Finally, | would like to thank the Aperam employees, the Leadership Team and my colleagues in
the Board of Directors, for their support, hard work and contribution to the Company’s performance
improvements in 2014. In particular | would like to express my gratitude to Philippe Darmayan for
everything he has done in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of Aperam. | am confident that under
the leadership of Timoteo Di Maulo, our newly appointed CEO, Aperam will continue to progress and
prosper and offer favorable and sustainable prospects for all our stakeholders.

of a secured bank loan maturing in 2015 and $163 million net reimbursements on the Borrowing Base
