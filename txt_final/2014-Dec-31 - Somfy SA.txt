JMANAGEMENT BOARD

REPORT

TO THE COMBINED GENERAI

MEETING

OF 13 MAY 2015

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in force, the
Management Board has convened you here in order to inform you on
the management of your company and its subsidiaries and to submit for
your approval the financial statements for the year ended 31 December
2014.

Somfy Group is the global leader in opening and closing automation for
both residential and commercial buildings.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

DEMERGER AND QUOTATION OF SOMFY PARTICIPATIONS

At its meeting of 14 May 2014, the Supervisory Board unanimously
decided to study the demerger of the Group into two entities, Somfy
Activities and Somfy Participations, as proposed by the Management
Board. The Management Board considered that more than six years
after its creation, Somfy Participations had acquired the necessary
maturity and experience to develop its activities autonomously.

The Supervisory Board meeting of 13 October 2014, having considered
the report of the independent expert (Valphi) on the transfer value of
the assets and the fairness of the financial conditions of the transaction,
unanimously approved the terms of the demerger of the Group’s two
business divisions, Somfy Activities and Somfy Participations.

As part of this transaction, on 29 October 2014 Somfy SA transferred the
assets of Somfy Participations (Gaviota Simbac, Zurfliih-Feller, Sirem,
Pellenc and Sofilab 4), with the exception of CIAT and FAAC securities,
to the public limited company (société anonyme) Edify, governed by
Luxembourg law, which was created on 16 September 2014 for the
purposes of the transaction.

The value of Edify at the end of the transfer was €253 million. It is
divided into 5,060,620 shares and is made up of €192 million and
€61 million for the equity portfolio and the balance of other financial
assets (receivables, cash and cash equivalents) respectively.

At its meeting of 27 November 2014, the General Meeting adopted
all the resolutions submitted for its approval. It has thus ratified the
separation of the Group’s two business divisions and decided to make an
exceptional distribution of reserves with shareholders having the choice
of receiving either a cash payment or shares in the company Edify.

At the General Meeting, Somfy’s majority shareholder confirmed its
decision to opt for payment in Edify shares.

The amount of €50 per Somfy share for payment in cash was established
based on the value of Edify, set at €253 million and divided into 5,060,620
shares comprising the share capital of said company.

The firm Valphi, acting as independent expert, believed the financial
conditions of the transaction to be fair for Somfy shareholders in a
report dated 9 October 2014, annexed to the prospectus for admitting
Edify shares to official listing and trading on the organised Euro MTF

market of the Luxembourg stock exchange, available via Somfy’s website

(www.somfy.com).

Edify shares were admitted for trading on the Luxembourg market on

the same date as the distribution was paid, namely 19 December 2014.

Prior to the demerger, Somfy Participations performed the following

legal transactions:

—In June 2014, acquisition of 5.89% of the share capital of Lacroix, a
French company specialised in the manufacture of wooden, cardboard,
plastic and composite packaging;

—In July 2014, acquisition of 68.4% of the share capital of Usines
Métallurgiques de Vallorbe (UMV) in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland,
one of the world leaders in the manufacture of high quality files for
use in many industries such as forestry, jewellery and watchmaking;

— In December 2014, acquisition of the bare ownership of 51.36% of the
share capital of Pellenc SA. At 31 December 2014, Somfy Participations
owns the full ownership of 48.4% of shares in Pellenc SA.

The aforementioned Lacroix, Usines Métallurgiques de Vallorbe and
Pellenc SA securities were incorporated into the transfer to Edify as
detailed above.
The demerger has been accounted for as a distribution of non-cash
assets in accordance with the IFRIC 17 interpretation. The Group took
the view that, although the demerger was an operation under common
control, the recognition principles could be applied. The financial impact
of this transaction was a loss of €60.9 million, which was recognised
in the income statement under the “Net profit of operations held for
sale or distribution” heading, in accordance with IFRS 5. This loss is
mainly attributable to the holding company discount applied to the
assets transferred to Edify, in accordance with the independent expert’s
valuation.

CIAT DISPOSAL PROCESS

On 23 July, Somfy SA received a firm offer from United Technologies
Corporation to acquire its equity investment in the share capital of CIAT
Group, a specialist in the air treatment and heat transfers of buildings.
The bid was subject to several conditions precedent, namely
consultation with CIAT Group’s works council (favourable opinion issued
on 28 October 2014), approval by CIAT Group following this consultation
and the authorisation of the supervisory bodies governing this type of
transaction (last authorisations received in December 2014).

The definitive transfer took place on 5 January 2015. The transaction is
worth approximately €117 million, including €38 million related to the
acquisition price of the securities, excluding costs, and €79 million for the
redemption of the CIAT bond issue originally subscribed to by Somfy SA.
The CIAT Group interest dates from 2008 for its initial portion and on the
day of the transfer represented 46.1% of the share capital of CIAT Group.

APPLICATION OF IFRS 5 — ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
OR DISTRIBUTION

The Group presented the demerger transaction and the disposal of
CIAT as operations distributed or held for sale, in accordance with IFRS
5 —Non-current assets held for sale or distribution.

The profit/(loss) from these operations is presented on a separate line
of the income statement, “Net profit from operations distributed and
held for sale”, and has been restated in the cash flow statement and the
income statement for all periods published.

The assets and liabilities of “operations distributed and held for sale”
are shown on separate lines of the Group’s balance sheet, without
restatement of previous periods.

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL

Somfy Activities impaired the goodwill of BFT Group, Giga and Garen
Automagao for a total of €24.3 million and its equity investment in
Neocontrol for €0.5 million at 31 December 2014, given the outlook of
these subsidiaries.

TAX AUDITS

Somfy SAS was subject in 2013 to a tax audit in relation to the 2009 and
2010 financial years. The main adjustment related to the transfer price
policy implemented between a subsidiary of Somfy SA, Somfy SAS and a
number of distribution subsidiaries.

During the second half of 2013, Somfy SAS, with the assistance of its
legal advisers, accepted to enter talks with the tax authorities in order
to reach an outcome acceptable to all parties.

The Group considered it probable that Somfy SAS would be compelled
to accept part of the additional tax assessment thus notified and had
therefore recognised a liability of €8.4 million in the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013.

During the first half of 2014, Somfy SAS and the tax authorities agreed
on the amount of this additional assessment. Somfy SAS thus recorded
a liability equal to the provision recognised in the financial statements
at 31 December 2013.

Somfy SA has been subject to a tax audit in relation to the 2010 and
2011 financial years. A liability of €3.1 million had been provisioned
in the 2013 annual financial statements. During the first half of 2014,
Somfy SA and the tax authorities agreed on the amount of this additional
assessment, which was identical to the provision recognised in the
financial statements at 31 December 2013.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Somfy Mexico SA, the Group’s Mexican subsidiary, has been subject to
a tax audit by the tax authorities in relation to foreign trade matters.
The proposed tax adjustment amounts to €1.7 million, primarily related
to customs duties. Somfy Mexico has appealed to the Mexican tax
authorities, which confirmed its opinion at the end of September 2013.
Following this reply, Somfy Mexico has appealed to the administrative
court. The Group considers that the arguments put forward by the tax
authorities remain disputable and is confident in the likelihood that this
ruling will be overturned. Therefore, the Group qualified the risk as a
contingent liability and no provision was recognised at 31 December 2014.

On 6 January 2014, Somfy SA was summoned to appear before the
Regional Court of Albertville to seek annulment of the transfer of the
company Spirel, which took place in 2010. Having had their first summons
rejected by the Regional Court of Albertville, Spirel’s employees served a
new summons on 27 June 2014. The hearings should take place in 2015.
Somfy SA disputes the arguments put forward by counsel for the Spirel
employees, believes it has complied with its obligations and remains
confident of its chances of receiving a favourable ruling. Therefore, the

Group qualified the risk as a contingent liability and no provision was
recognised at 31 December 2014.

CHANGES IN GROUP STRUCTURE

The scope was impacted by the demerger of the Group into two entities,
Somfy Activities and Somfy Participations as detailed in the section
“Demerger and quotation of Somfy Participations”.

The Group made no major acquisitions during the 2014 financial year,
other than those referred to in the same section.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

PARENT COMPANY DATA

For the year to 31 December 2014, Somfy SA generated sales of
€1.8 million. Net financial income amounted to €165.5 million, including
€140.9 million in dividends paid by the subsidiaries in respect of their
net profit for the year to 31 December 2013. Net extraordinary expense
totalled €38.7 million.

Net profit was €104.6 million, after inclusion of an income tax charge of
€13.8 million.

CONSOLIDATED DATA

SALES

Group sales were €981.7 million for the financial year just ended, an
increase of 6.4% on a restated basis and 4.8% on a like-for-like basis.
The strongest increases were recorded in Central and Eastern Europe, as
well as in Southern Europe and Northern Europe, reflecting the recovery
in the Iberian Peninsula, Benelux, the UK and Scandinavia.

Significant increases were also recorded in Germany, Asia-Pacific,
despite the slowdown in growth and the postponement of projects in
China, and in the Americas, in spite of the dip noted during the year
due to the deteriorating situation in Brazil and a high level of baseline
in the US.

Only France ended the financial year on a negative note, as a result of
the sluggish economic environment and a weak property sector.

RESULTS

The Group’s current operating result was €149.7 million for the financial
year, an increase of 3.7% on a restated basis, and represented 15.3% of
sales.

The recorded increase is attributable to sales growth and a sustained
industrial margin. It also reflected contained cost increases despite
the integration of recently-acquired companies and ongoing strategic
investment (innovation, sales force and marketing).

Consolidated net profit totalled €38.1 million, adversely impacted by a
non-recurring operational expense of €23.9 million, corresponding to
goodwill impairment, and the net loss of €53.8 million from operations
held for sale or distribution, primarily attributable to the overall holding
company discount applied to assets transferred to Edify, in accordance
with the independent expert’s valuation.

Net profit of continuing operations remained stable at €91.9 million and
cash flow grew by 12.3% compared with the 2013 restated amount to
€148.4 million.

SEGMENT REPORTING AT 31 DECEMBER 2014

FINANCIAL STRUCTURE

Shareholder’s equity declined from €929.8 million to €570.4 million
during the financial year and the net cash surplus of €94.2 million turned
into net financial debt of €199.9 million, €120.5 million after deducting
the debenture loan granted to CIAT.

The changes noted are closely related to movements associated with
the demerger. They do not compromise the strength of the balance
sheet, as testified by the gearing ratio, which equates to 35.0% based on
published figures and 21.1% after restatement for the aforementioned
debenture loan receivable.

The net financial debt corresponds to the difference between financial
assets and financial liabilities. Notably it takes into account unlisted
bonds receivable, issued by certain companies in which shares are held
or related entities, earn-out on acquisitions, liabilities relating to options
granted to minority shareholders in fully-consolidated companies and
deferred settlements of a financial nature. Not included are securities
in non-controlling equity investments, convertible bonds, deposits &
guarantees and government grants.

The net financial debt is detailed in note 21 to the consolidated financial
statements.

POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS

The composition of the Management Board changed as of 1 January
2015 and is now as follows:

— Jean-Philippe Demaél, Chairman of the Management Board,

— Pierre Ribeiro, Group Chief Financial Officer,

— Jean Guillaume Despature, member of the Management Board.

On 5 January 2015, Somfy SA finalised the sale of its equity interest in
CIAT Group. Pursuant to IFRS 5, the capital gain realised by this sale will
be recognised in the 2015 financial year.

On 19 January 2015, through its subsidiary Somfy Brazil, Somfy Activities
exercised its purchase option to buy an additional 10% of the share
capital of Neocontrol for €0.3 million taking its equity investment to
61%. A mutual put/call option remains for the acquisition of the residual
39%, exercisable by 2017. This company is consolidated by the equity
method due to the existence of a shareholders’ agreement placing the
shareholders in a position of joint control.

OUTLOOK

The slowdown noted at the end of the previous financial year, notably
in France, is set to continue over the first six months of the current year,
mainly due to the impact of the unfavourable base effect. It should only
be partly offset by the recovery noted in Northern and Southern Europe
and renewed competitiveness related to the decline of the Euro.
Against this backdrop, efficiency improvement plans will be maintained,
with the investment effort primarily directed at innovation. The entry of
Somfy to the Board of Directors of Thread, a connected home platform
initiated by Nest, represents an additional step towards connectivity of
the Group’s devices.

At the end of February, the tri-annual industry trade show was held in
Stuttgart, Germany (R&T 2015). The numerous innovations presented by
Somfy, the result of the investment effort made over the last few years,
were very favourably received by industry players. They will enable the
Group to consolidate its positions and conquer new markets over the
coming years.

years in the name of the same shareholder at the end of the calendar
year preceding that of each General Meeting.

In the case of a capital increase by the capitalisation of reserves,
profits or issue premiums, registered shares granted free of charge to a
shareholder in exchange for existing shares, which already benefit from
this right, will be entitled to the same double voting right.

All shares converted into bearer shares or whose ownership has been
transferred shall lose their entitlement to a double voting right, except
in instances provided for by law.”

INFORMATION ON THE BUYBACK OF OWN SHARES
(Article L. 225-211 of the Commercial Code)

The company has implemented several successive share buyback
programmes. The most recent buyback programme was launched in
2014; it was authorised by the Combined General Meeting of 14 May
2014, and had the following objectives:

—To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the Somfy
SA share, by way of an investment services provider within a liquidity
contract that complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI recognised by
the “Autorité des Marchés Financiers”;

—To retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange them or
use them within the framework of potential acquisitions, recognising
that shares acquired to that end may not exceed 5% of the company’s
share capital;

-To ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/ or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or corporate
officers of the Group, as well as all other shares allocated under a
company or group savings scheme (or similar), in relation to employee
profit-sharing and/or any other form of allocation to employees and/
or corporate officers of the Group;

—To cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of shares in
the company, in accordance with current regulations;

—To proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired, subject
to the authorisation granted by the General Meeting of shareholders
of 14 May 2014 in its sixth resolution, sitting in extraordinary session.

These transactions could notably be carried out at times of a takeover
bid, in compliance with the applicable legislative provisions.
The maximum purchase price was set at €330 per share, with the
maximum amount of the share buyback programme set at €258,614,400.
During the financial year just ended, on the basis of the authorisations
given by the General Meetings of 2013 and 2014, the company bought
back 26,638 shares at an average price of €234.34, sold 26,934 shares at
an average price of €233.19 and transferred 10,857 shares at an average
price of €172.01 in relation to the exercise of share purchase options
and 120 shares in relation to the final allocation of free shares.

All of the 26,638 shares acquired were allocated to the liquidity objective.

No shares were re-allocated for objectives other than those initially

specified.

The company held 401,457 of its own shares at 31 December 2014,
representing 5.12% of the capital; the value of the purchase price of the
share amounted to €179.38 for a nominal value of €1 each, representing
a total nominal value of €401,457 (€566 for the liquidity contract,
€112,254 to be retained for future acquisition transactions and €288,637
for option plans to purchase shares and/or free share allocation plans).

The Management Board will submit a new treasury share purchase plan
for a period of 18 months for shareholders’ approval. This plan would
replace the current programme, which would be terminated early. It
would allow management to purchase up to 10% of the shares of the
company, if necessary restated for any potential capital increase or
decrease transactions that may be carried out over the timeframe of the
programme. The objectives of this programme would be:

—To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the Somfy
share, by way of an investment services provider within a liquidity
contract that complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI recognised by
the “Autorité des Marchés Financiers”;

—To retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange them or
use them as payment within the framework of potential acquisitions;
—To ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/ or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or corporate
officers of the Group, as well as all other shares allocated under a
company or group savings scheme (or similar), in relation to employee
profit-sharing and/or any other form of allocation to employees and/

or corporate officers of the Group;

— To cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of shares in
the company, in accordance with current regulations;

—To proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired, subject
to the authorisation granted by the General Meeting of Shareholders
of 14 May 2014 in its sixth resolution, sitting in extraordinary session.

The company would reserve the right to use options or derivative

instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

We propose to set the maximum purchase price at €330 per share. The

maximum value of the transaction, taking account of the 401,457 treasury

shares held at 31 December 2014, is therefore set at €126,133,590.

objective scale, taking the following items into account:

— Profit growth (average annual growth of current operating result over
two years),

— Return on capital employed (average ROCE over two years),

— Business development, measured by sales growth and by its differential
with the sales growth of a range of reference points comprised of nine

remuneration quantitative criteria set by the Supervisory Board is not

disclosed.

The variable remuneration also includes the incentive bonus, profit

sharing and contributions to the Group savings scheme, as described

Benefits in kind consist of the use of a company car.

Details of remuneration paid during the financial year just ended are

included in the summary table (page 21).

The company CMC SARL established a supplementary pension plan in
2006. This plan applies to Directors and III-C position Senior Executives,
as well as Managers benefiting from an employment contract, in
accordance with the categories defined by the French Convention
Collective Nationale des Ingénieurs et Cadres de la Métallurgie.

The plan grants a contingent right to supplementary pension, pursuant
to the so-called “Article 39”, which is dependent on the length of service
of the beneficiary (a minimum of 15 years). The right to a supplementary
pension is acquired at a rate of 0.75% per year of service and cannot
exceed 15% of the potential beneficiary’s reference salary. The reference
salary is defined as the average of the best three years after applying
CNAV re-evaluation coefficients. Based on estimates setting at 35% the
future rate of replacement provided by the compulsory pension plans
when the affected population reaches retirement age, this plan should
enable the rate to increase to 35 + 15 = 50% of the reference salary for
beneficiaries whose career within the Group lasted 20 years or more.
Commitments of the plan and corresponding assets have been
outsourced to an insurance company. Future commitments are fully
covered by plan assets under management, which were measured at
fair value.

Member of the Management Board concerned: Jean-Philippe Demaél,
potential beneficiary of this pension plan.

In relation to his employment contract prior to his appointment to the
Management Board, Jean-Philippe Demaél also benefits from CMC SARL
so-called “Article 83” defined contribution pension plan, applicable to
Senior Executives as well as Managers benefiting from an employment
contract, for whom the portion of contributions payable by the company
represents 6.25% of remuneration, limited to the tranche B cap
applicable to the Senior Executives’ regime.

For members of the Management Board who had benefited from
stock options until then, the new constraints introduced by the Law
of 3 December 2008 have led the Supervisory Board to exclude them
from future allocations of performance-based shares and stock options.
However, the Board deemed it necessary to continue giving perspective
to their contribution and bring their interest as much as possible
in line with those of the shareholders and other managers, as in the
past. Therefore, it was decided to grant them variable remuneration

SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT / 2014 19

04 / MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

04 / MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

based on identical performance conditions to those used for allocating
performance-based shares to Management. No payments were made in
this respect during the financial year.

It should be noted that the Chairman of the Management Board has
always been excluded from stock option and performance-based share
allocations and is therefore not concerned by this decision.

YEAR

The Chairman of the Management Board is not a beneficiary of option
plans or performance-based shares.

During the financial year, no member of the Management Board received
options or performance-based shares, nor benefited from performance-
based shares that became available to them.

PROCEDURE FOR SETTING THE REMUNERATION OF CORPORATE
OFFICERS

The remuneration of Management detailed above is proposed by the
Remuneration Committee. It is revised each year on the basis of expert
advice and is in line with the market.

The Remuneration Committee, having considered the Middlenext
recommendations on the remuneration of executive corporate officers
of listed companies, submits for approval to the Supervisory Board the
various components of remuneration and the criteria for allocating
the variable share of corporate officers’ remuneration, so that their
remuneration may be fixed. The variable remuneration criteria for each
member of the Management Board are noted above in the section
“Appointments held by Management Board members and remuneration
received from Somfy SA and subsidiaries under its control”.

At the General Meeting of 13 May 2015, it will be proposed to the
shareholders to increase attendance fees to be apportioned between
the members of the Supervisory Board from €100,000 to €150,000 for
the 2015 financial year and until otherwise specified.

The Supervisory Board apportions attendance fees among its members in
proportion to their attendance at Board meetings and Audit Committee
and Remuneration Committee meetings.

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives specific remuneration
in relation to his duties as Chairman.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Audit Committee currently comprises three members: Victor
Despature, Committee Chairman, Valérie Pilcer and Paule Cellard.

The Committee’s mission is to monitor the preparation of the financial
information and the efficiency of internal control and risk management
systems. It is also informed of due diligence carried out by the Statutory
Auditors in their legal assignment to audit the parent company and
consolidated financial statements, ensures the latter’s independence
and is involved in their selection.

The Audit Committee supervises the work of Internal Audit and approves
the annual audit plan. It proposes, directs and ensures the follow-up of
Internal Audit assignments.

Since its creation, it has met at each half-year and year-end balance
sheet date.

During the 2014 financial year, the Audit Committee met on four
occasions with all members in attendance.

Under the supervision of the Audit Committee, the Internal Audit
Department reports to the Chairman of the Management Board, and by
delegation to the Group’s Chief Financial Officer.

The Department, comprising the Internal Audit Officer and the
equivalent of 3.5 full-time auditors, carries out audits that evaluate the
correct application of accounting principles, the organisation and the
systems put in place within the entity subject to audit.

An annual audit plan, prepared together with the Management of Somfy
Group, is approved by the Management Board and then validated by the
Audit Committee. The assignments included in the audit plan provide
an independent assessment of the efficiency of the system of internal
control in each entity.

Where appropriate, the principal weaknesses identified in internal
control are reported to Management and recommendations are issued.
A follow-up of the implementation of recommendations is made twice a
year. A report is presented to the Management Board and to the Audit
Committee each year.

In addition, urgent assignments that were not provided for in the
audit plan may be carried out during the year at the request of the
Management Board or the Audit Committee.

Twice a year, the Internal Audit Officer presents a report on the
activities of the Department to the Management Board and to the Audit
Committee.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The Remuneration Committee currently comprises two members:
Michel Rollier, Committee Chairman (independent member) and Victor
Despature. Its mission is to submit proposals to the Supervisory Board,
in particular in respect of the amount and calculation of corporate
officers’ remuneration and to provide advice concerning the amount of
attendance fees.

At least once a year, the Committee calls on a firm specialised in the
subject of senior executive remuneration, which provides advice on the
practices that are generally applied in companies of a comparable size.
During the year just ended, it met three times. The rate of attendance by
the members was 100%.

The members of the Remuneration Committee report verbally to the
Supervisory Board on their work and on the opinions they have issued,
thus helping the Board to prepare and make decisions in terms of
corporate officers’ remuneration.

INDEPENDENCE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SUPERVISORY
BOARD

As provided by the Middlenext framework, the Board has assessed the
independence of its members.

Based on the independence criteria suggested by the Middlenext
framework, the Supervisory Board notes that, to date, an independent

member of the Board is a member who has no relationship of any nature

whatsoever with Somfy SA or its management, or with a company

consolidated by the Somfy Group, that may affect his/her freedom of

judgement, and who meets the following criteria:

—Is not and has not been an employee or executive corporate officer
of Somfy SA or any other Group company during the last three years;

—Is not a significant customer, supplier or banker of Somfy SA or its
Group, or for which Somfy SA or its Group represents a significant
share of his/her business activity;

—Is not a significant shareholder of Somfy SA;

— Is not closely related to a corporate officer or major shareholder;

—Has not been a statutory auditor of Somfy SA over the past three years.

In light of these criteria, the Supervisory Board considered that Paule

Cellard, Valérie Pilcer, and Michel Rollier qualified as independent

members.

INFORMATION ON RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
(ARTICLES L. 232-1 AND L. 233-26

OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

In 2014, the “Research and Development” teams were involved in
developing several major innovations, to be unveiled in early 2015 at
the R+T international trade show taking place in Stuttgart.

In the rolling shutters segment, Somfy has developed a new motor,
the RS 100 which is intended to gradually replace the traditional LT 50
range, and therefore to make up almost a third of the Group’s sales. This
major venture will result in a motor that offers innovations and benefits
at all stages of the chain: for the user, the installer and the industrial
manufacturer.

Development efforts in the field of interior blinds focused on silence,
with the introduction of the Ultra Silence motor. The ambition is to
anticipate the future needs of consumers initially in North America and
then around the world.

By being more attentive to customers’ feedback, Somfy has designed for
these blind and rolling shutter markets, a new range of control solutions,
in particular through the Nina range of controls, completely redesigned
in terms of design and interface.

Innovation has also focused on the Access Division with ongoing
research on interoperability between its products (Access and other
Somfy equipment) and also thanks to the first solutions that can be
connected to the Internet.

In 2014, the Group continued to develop the “connected” sector, firstly
by increasing the amount of equipment operated by the TaHoma
interface such as heating or lighting, and secondly by proposing a more
affordable offer that can be connected with the first device, Connexoon.
It should be noted that the TaHoma application is used by 95% of
customers on a daily basis and a third of its usage is outside the home,
demonstrating that developing these new technologies is responding to
a genuine and significant trend in living spaces.

In addition and in this area, Somfy, in collaboration with regional
authorities, set up a research project on improving energy efficiency, the
human/building interface, the COMETE project (ClOud pour la Maison
intelligente et l’EfficaciTé Energétique — Cloud for the smart home and
energy efficiency). The aim in particular is to create smarter calculation
algorithms.

The Group has created a first design centre for curtain markets in China.
China makes up 60% of this market’s global sales, and it is the first time
that Somfy has set up a development centre outside France.

These numerous innovations were protected by 40 new patents in 2014,
taking the overall patent portfolio to 1,783.

Somfy Group companies exercise their environmental, social and

societal responsibility through the implementation of Sustainable

Development strategies guided by the following objectives:

—Minimising the environmental impact of all its activities, sites and
products;

-Ensuring the professional and personal development of all its
employees;

— Discharging their civic responsibility by involving themselves in social
issues consistent with their areas of work;

—Supporting the development of communities wherever they are
established.

In the field of housing, Somfy Group sought to help improve living

environments, by meeting peoples’ growing expectations in terms of

comfort, security, saving energy and maintaining their independence,
by acting responsibly and ensuring that natural resources are preserved.

Several principles help ensure the implementation of these strategic

policies:

—Acontinuous improvement plan measured by indicators,

—The establishment of a structured dialogue with the stakeholders:
customer satisfaction survey, measuring employee commitment,
investor and shareholder relations policy, active participation both
internationally and locally with working groups and organisations on
industry issues,

— Regular and transparent communication.

Somfy Group’s Sustainable Development policy addresses the high

expectations of its customers and all its stakeholders, be they the

development of environmentally friendly solutions, or social or societal
commitments.

GOVERNANCE

The organisation as a whole and the teams within the Group contribute
to the continuous improvement of the Sustainable Development policy.
Since 2008, Somfy has had a Sustainable Development Department. It
reports to the Group’s Operations Department. Its missions are to guide
the implementation of the Group’s environmental commitments.

The Group Human Resources Department has the task of guiding the
implementation of Somfy’s commitments relating to social matters.

The Communications Department has the task of guiding the
implementation of Somfy’s commitments relating to societal matters.
In this regard, the Group Communications Director is a member of
the Somfy Foundation Governing Board, the main driving force of
the Group’s citizenship policy, and whose main purpose is to support
projects that fight poor housing.

The Strategic Committee for Sustainable Development brings together
the Sustainable Development Director, the Group Human Resources
Director and the Group Communications Director. Its mission is to ensure
the coherent implementation of the three lines of Somfy’s Sustainable
Development strategy: Planet, Employees and Society.

CLARIFICATION REGARDING SCOPE

Restated for the exit of the companies Sirem and Zurfliih-Feller as part of
the demerger of the Group’s two divisions, Somfy Activities and Somfy
Participations, which was completed in December 2014, the 2013 scope
included 3,257 people, representing 53% of the Group’s workforce.
Three new companies were added to the 2014 report - two in Italy and
one in China, which increases the number of companies covered by the
2014 report to ten and includes 3,468 employees (up 6.48% vs. 2013),
representing 55.5% of the Group’s total workforce.

The 2014 scope covers 73% of the Group’s industrial staff.

Across the Group, employee expenses amounted to €286.9 million at
31 December 2014, compared with €270.4 million at 31 December 2013
at constant scope.

These companies are located on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia
and America) and in six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, China
and USA).

Note: It should be noted that the expanded analysis scope of the social
data would temporarily render any comparison with data from the
previous report difficult.

Some companies were excluded from the scope of this report. This
situation is related to the existence of very low workforces in certain
organisations (distribution subsidiaries spread out over vast geographic
areas such as Russia or South America), or the lack of Human Resources
information systems designed for collecting data easily.

To overcome this last difficulty, an international information system is
currently being deployed within the Group’s main entities, its aim in the
long run being to cover all Somfy regions and companies.

* WAY, Somfy Italia and Somfy China employees were added to 2013 data to
enable the two financial years to be compared.

The workforce within the 2014 CSR scope remained stable in comparison
with 2013.

The male to female staff ratio within the scope remained stable with a
50/50 balance.

Implementation of the recruitment policy continued leading to growth
of almost 18% in the number of young workers under the age of 25.
With the exception of the 2 25 and < 35 year old range, the other ages
ranges grew thanks to the rising age of workers.

A RESPONSIBLE SOCIAL POLICY

The Group’s Social Responsibility policy is to primarily support Somfy
Group’s transformation in its continued international expansion, in
creating new markets and increasing its innovation activity.

In 2014, the Group continued to deploy its Human Resources roadmap
along three main lines:

-— Commitment,

— Skills and employability,

— Performance.

All the initiatives deployed are aimed at developing the Group’s
“Employer” brand to simultaneously make it a lever to create both
commitment and external attractiveness.

AREA: COMMITMENT

Preamble
The measures deployed help to provide both direction to the collective
project and consistency to maintain and strengthen commitment within
the teams.

Work organisation

In all the companies within the scope, the average working week
complies with the applicable local legislation and varies between 35 and
40 hours of work per week.

The options for individual arrangements vary according to country and
site activity. Such arrangements are better developed in Europe and in
non industrial activities.

TOTAL 3,468 100%

Daytime work
i Shift work

Organisation by shift schedule is predominant at our production sites.
Depending on the sites it varies between 25 and 90% of the workforce.
Overall, shift-based organisation concerns 32% of the scope’s workforce,
a slight decline compared with 2013 data.

It should be noted that at the six industrial sites covered by this report,
night work is a temporary working arrangement in case of production
peaks.

Collective working hours can vary depending on production plans and
business opportunities. This flexibility is essential in adapting to market
needs.

Social relations

Social dialogue is an important element in regulating the collective
organisation of work. The company wishes to enhance its quality and
role.

All the companies comply with the local laws and agreements connected
with their activities.

Although not all have union representatives, social dialogue is
guaranteed or implemented through meetings and/or communication
with staff representative bodies or with employees directly.

New ways of facilitating dialogue were introduced, in particular in
France with an opportunity for more direct contact with production staff
(consultation process at Intervalle Court — AIC -).

24 SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT / 2014

Certain companies concluded new agreements in 2014 or amendments

to agreements concluded in previous years.

The main agreements and amendments signed related to:

— Salary increases and other salary-related benefits (France and Italy),

—The extra supplementary pension schemes Art.83 and PERCO (France),

—The allocation and management arrangements for bonus incentives
and profit-sharing (France),

—The allocation of exceptional bonuses (France and Tunisia),

— Gender equality and solidarity (France),

— Employee training (France, Italy),

— Generational contract and Forward Planning of Employment and Skills
(France),

— Social dialogue framework (France),

— Safety, environment and corporate regulation (China).

Social dialogue is a way of making Somfy Group’s social frame of

reference progress and informing employees about the Group’s position

and its development and transformation areas.

Health and safety
Most of the companies have an occupational health department and

internal safety functions, notably strengthened in France by the support
of Company Doctors and specialists in ergonomics.

Significant efforts have been made in many countries to reduce the
exposure to risks of employees and temporary workers and to improve
their working conditions. In France, a safety manager was appointed
to coordinate and strengthen our preventive measures. In addition,
an IT tool for the management and control of the comprehensive risk
assessment document has been selected and will be rolled out in 2015.
The 2014 bonus incentive agreement for Somfy SAS included a target
related to the reduction of the severity rate of accidents.

Frequency and severity rate indicators

In 2014, it should be noted that despite all the initiatives that were
undertaken or strengthened, the frequency of accidents at work slightly
increased overall for the main companies within the scope. Conversely,
for the most part the severity rate improved. To confirm this analysis, it
can be noted that the number of accidents at work increased by 11% in
2014 but the number of days’ absence fell by 20%.

Preventive actions had an effect on the severity but they must be
continued in 2015 in order to reverse the frequency trend. The European
industrial structure has set itself reduction targets for its frequency rate
effective from 2015.

It should be noted that the safety criterion was listed as the highest
satisfaction criterion during the last social barometer of commitment
within the Group. This strength must however be maintained since
results in this field are never permanently achieved.

** 2013 data has been restated compared with previously published data to take changes in scope into account.

Regarding Somfy SAS, initiatives dedicated to safety training represented
a quarter of the 2014 training investment (6,854 hours out of a total
27,564 hours).

The average rate of absenteeism was 3.1% for the entire reporting
scope, a significant decline compared with 2013.

Work related accidents and occupational diseases are monitored,
and preventive action implemented, by dedicated working groups
or specially appointed employee representative bodies, according to
country (HSWCC in France for example).

Subjects connected to the issues of psycho-social risks (PSR), Musculo-
Skeletal Disorders (MSD) and more generally life in the workplace
were covered by several initiatives in France in 2014 (creation of a
PSR steering committee, implementation of a monitoring network,
training of employees and managers in the management of stress and
of emergencies, training in movements and posture and workstation
ergonomics, rest and relaxation initiatives, job rotation in production,
cutting road risks, company restaurant, sustainable development
initiatives, etc.).

They will continue in 2015 with the aim of signing an agreement within
the field of the Disability policy and the quality of work life.

Moreover, in connection with legal obligations, the company has, in
France, begun an initial appraisal assessing how demanding the work is
in order to implement preventive measures as part of the comprehensive
risk assessment document.

With regard to occupational diseases, the main issues recognised are
linked to Musculo-Skeletal Disorders (MSD) in a context of handling and
repetitive movements.

The number of people affected by a recognised occupational disease has
decreased compared with 2012 and 2013. The frequency of recognition
of these occupational diseases justifies the specific preventive measures
currently being rolled out in France.

Equal treatment

In terms of professional equality, taking into account developments
in legislation, the French companies have signed agreements or action
plans committing them to action in the field of professional equality. An
initial review of these agreements highlighted positive developments in
terms of increasing diversity and the rate of managerial staff.

Progress remains slow and must be pursued. An amendment to the
Somfy SAS agreement implemented a solidarity support scheme for
situations involving seriously ill children.

In addition, partners connected with the payment of the apprenticeship
tax were asked to sign gender equality charters to encourage them to
move forward with us on the issue.

The male to female staff ratio within the scope remained stable with
a 50/50 balance. It should be noted that across the Group scope,
this workforce ratio is 60% men and 40% women. This variation can
be explained by the presence in the 2014 CSR scope of three major
production sites with overwhelmingly female staff (Cluses, SITEM and
LianDa).

In the area of disability, the majority of the Group’s companies are

subject to local regulations with which they comply.

Some take additional action, often with the support of specialist

agencies, to improve the working conditions of any employees affected

by specific health problems, their continued employment remaining an

ongoing priority.

Several measures, such as adapting workstations or working hours,

adapting premises, or support in terms of restructuring or reclassification

can be seen.

Regarding recruitment, the publication of employment offers on

specialist sites, participation in disability forums, partnerships with

specialist agencies, etc., all create greater potential for recruiting

disabled people.

In Somfy SAS, an audit of practices was launched at the end of 2014. Its

findings will allow the foundations of a Disability agreement to be built

in 2015, to go further than the Disability friendly initiatives undertaken

for several years now.

More broadly, Somfy Group and its employees are keen to respect the

men and women affected by its activities.

This is reflected in a commitment to:

— Respect differences, improve diversity and reject discrimination;

-Ensure the health, safety and decent working conditions for the
company’s employees and partners;

— Seek to develop the skills and employability of staff;

— Seek the professional development of employees;

— Guarantee constructive social dialogue.

An Ethics Charter will be rolled out in 2015, and will cover these

commitments in full.

Somfy Group has a network of Human Resources Managers extending

across the entire scope covered by this report. One of their main roles

is to ensure the respect of Human Rights, particularly examining within

their scope rights and concerns relating to racial discrimination, torture,

enforced disappearances, disabled people and the rights of women,

children, migrants, minorities and indigenous peoples.

In addition, academies for leadership and management training that are
currently being rolled out within the Group are equally concerned by
the performance requirement in relation to employees and looking after
them.

Commitment survey

In late 2014, the Group conducted a new survey on commitment
covering its entire worldwide scope. This commitment extends beyond
just team satisfaction and constitutes a key factor for the company’s
success. The Group return rate for this survey was 79%.

The overall results were provided to all management and employees.
At Group level, the commitment rate grew by 3% in comparison with the
previous score, rising from 48% in 2012 to 51% in 2014.

In one part of the Group’s entities, a very significant improvement was
seen in the commitment rate.

The satisfaction rate for the levers identified in 2012 as priorities for
commitment increased. They related to performance and remuneration
management.

Action plans implemented after Somfyscope 2012 led to an increase in
satisfaction for priority levers. Two of them, career opportunities and
remuneration, remain key levers for improving the rate of commitment.
Amongst the other priorities identified in 2014 were policies and
procedures, employee benefits, and the image of the company and the
Group.

The results of the survey offered positive feedback regarding the
transformation processes taking place within Somfy.

Somfy’s strengths are safety, relationships with colleagues, how
interesting the work is, and the work/life balance.

Managers will be responsible for implementing and monitoring an action
plan with their teams (>10 people) and thereby helping to strengthen
the commitment of Somfy Group employees.

AREA: EMPLOYABILITY AND SKILLS
Preamble

All the initiatives are undertaken to ensure that the skills of Group
employees are matched with the organisation’s needs and to ensure the
employability of staff.

Employment

During the 2014 financial year, staff numbers within the scope of analysis
remained relatively stable. Recruitment numbers of 302 were offset by
a similar number of exits from the scope, with 289 departures, 22 of
which were redundancies or dismissals (8%). It should be noted that the
company wanted to focus on internal mobility. As such, in France, more
than 50% of positions were filled via internal mobility.

2014 Somfy SAS major policies

The major areas of focus concerned working practices, job skills,
languages and intercultural skills, employee health and safety, quality,
and project management.

Jobs and Skills Planning and Generations

Over the course of 2014, the company focused on Marketing skills and
those related to the digital world.

At the end of 2014, the Group implemented a new round of strategic
discussions in order to draw up its road map for 2015-2020. Once
these key areas have been outlined, the operational managers and
HR managers will be able to extrapolate the consequences within the
capabilities observatories at both qualitative and quantitative level.

124 people benefited from the HORIZON mechanism introduced in
France to support employees in relation to analysing and securing their
career path.

Academy -— Leadership and management

Somfy Group has continued to deploy its management academy
focused on strengthening leadership and team management. This
training programme began in 2013 globally with two pilot groups, one
for France and one International. In 2014, two new groups of managers
were formed. To date, approximately 60 managers out of the 170
targeted have received training or are currently being trained in the new
management model that the company is seeking to develop.

This course, aimed at Managers’ Managers, strives to strengthen our
ability to adapt to internal and external change, and to encourage
transformation by sharing a common managerial language and practices.
The Management Committees of the various entities have adopted the
processes and tools identified during this course, and have deployed
them at an operational level within their teams.

This dual approach encourages the adoption of managerial practices
best suited to our organisation’s challenges.

SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT / 2014 27

04 / MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

AREA: PERFORMANCE
Preamble

The Group’s aim is to strengthen the culture of individual and collective
performance whilst adhering to its values.

Project to overhaul the Performance Review

Anew mechanism to monitor performance was established during 2014
and rolled out to a pilot group over late 2014/early 2015, integrating
cross entity targets to promote cooperation and a closer link between
performance and bonus. It will be rolled out in full in 2016 after all
managers have been trained.

The impact of the new performance development system will ensure

quality and uniformity in the rollout of an appraisal system and process

which:

-Expressly informs employees of the requirements and priorities
related to their position (permanent tasks);

-Defines Group performance targets by entity, individual and
management team;

— Explains the level of expectation in terms of skills and behaviours via a
clear and common frame of reference;

-Establishes a clear link between performance and remuneration:
individual increase measured against performance of permanent role
and bonus measured against annual targets;

—Interacts with other HR processes (remuneration, training, career
management);

Training managers in a SMART definition of targets and in how to
conduct the various interviews;

— Offering support to managers in the assessment of employees in
the event of a particular concern (poor performance, behavioural
problem, etc.).

Talent Review

The Talent Review process is currently being revised in order to improve
career management. It will include the introduction of succession
planning, the identification of potential and key roles and lastly, the

construction of personalised development plans.

Remuneration: project to categorise management positions (Grading)

In 2014, Somfy established a first reporting level for management

positions within the Group’s structure through the intermediary of a

Mercer assessment methodology (International Position Evaluation).

The implementation of Grading will enable to help:

— Ensure the fairness on an internal basis and competitiveness on an
external basis of remuneration;

—Promote remuneration of talents that is consistent, competitive,
attractive and loyalty building;

— Structure variable remuneration programmes.

The implementation of Grading will enable the provision of clear

information on the rules for employees’ eligibility for the different

components of the remuneration packages and on the employee benefits

in place, whilst providing managers with a common tool to monitor their

management teams (remuneration and career management).

In 2015, the ongoing project will involve:

—Pursuing the assessments for the N-3 members of the Executive
Committee;

— Analysing the internal equity of remunerations within Somfy’s gradings;

— Comparing Somfy’s remuneration levels with market practices;

— Constructing a grading based salary structure;

— Defining the rules of governance;

— Communicating with managers.

International Human Resources Information System: IHRIS

The Group has set up an International Human Resources Information
System able to monitor key HR processes in support of Somfy Group’s
business goals. These processes notably concern staff monitoring,
performance management, team reviews, succession planning,
remuneration packages, etc.

This Human Resources Information System (HRIS) will help to build and
develop an HR culture that is shared far beyond the HR community, and
to provide management with new decision making aids.

The creation of this HRIS involved a foundation of personal and
professional data, the operational implementation of which took place
throughout the 2014 financial year.

Its gradual rollout across all Group companies will continue for between
two and five years depending on the scope.

A working application on performance reviews and the management
of targets was prepared during the second half of 2014 and will be
gradually rolled out from January 2015.

Additional applications will be under consideration in the second half of
2015 and will form the basis of a progressive international deployment
plan over the next few years so that the information system increasingly
adds value for Group management and employees.

The Human Resources roadmap remained ambitious. The desire to make
Somfy a great experience for its employees be leveraging the values of
boldness, respect, openness and lastly proximity will be highlighted
when it meets the future economic and social project currently under
development.

ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

NATURE OF ACTIVITIES, ASSOCIATED RISKS AND MEASURES
TAKEN

The activities of the sites are of tertiary, industrial and logistical natures.
Industrial sites mainly perform product assembly operations from plastic
and metallic components and circuit boards sourced from outside the
sites. Assembly operations do not produce gas emissions, liquid releases
or substances discharges, with the exception of packing waste and
possible manufacturing scrap which are subject to selective sorting and
recovery.

There are no machine operations generating waste material.

There is no specific noise pollution generated by the industrial sites
affecting local residents. Indeed, operations are situated inside the
buildings and mainly consist of the assembly of small parts.

The different sites located within French territory are subject to
classification levels compliant with French legislation in relation to
pollution or nuisance risks that these facilities are likely to create.

The sites are subjected to an authorisation scheme for storage in covered
warehouses and a registration scheme for compression facilities and
installation of accumulators for recharging fork-lift trucks.

There are no facilities that correspond to the maximum level,
“Authorisation with encumbrances — (AS)3” commonly known as
“SEVESO”.

Conclusions on the nature of activities, associated risks and measures

For these reasons, the risk of air, soil, water and noise pollution is low
or non-existent. This report does not therefore provide any information
on these subjects.

In relation to these risks of pollution or nuisance that Somfy Group’s
sites are likely to create and the preventive measures introduced, the
amount of provisions and guarantees for environmental risks is nil.
Given this low level of environmental risk on these sites, there are no
specific resources deployed. The measures introduced are managed by
the facilities departments of the sites.

GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

Somfy has a Sustainable Development Department. This department

integrates the resources and skills necessary for the completion of

projects that come under the heading “Planet”. It oversees a network
of 35 eco-ambassadors who support, in each sector, the introduction of
measures resulting from the Sustainable Development policy.

In 2014, Somfy continued to pursue the environmental policy objectives

that were redefined in 2013.

The Carbon Test® completed in 2012 identified as a priority work on

electricity consumption and the use of raw materials; this priority

remained unchanged in 2014.

In 2014, the growing number of requirements of our markets and

regulations reinforced the need to better understand the substances

used in our products.

The eco-design of products was therefore identified as a priority area.

In 2014, the new requirements for eco-design defined in 2013 were

integrated into the specifications of new products. These requirements

cover three topics:

— Controlled greenhouse gas emissions,

— Materials selected for their low impact on health and the environment,

— An available statement of the environmental impacts in line with

the PEP ecopassport® programme to which Somfy has signed up. This

programme, developed by the electricity industry, defines a standardised
method for making environmental declarations in accordance with
international regulations (ISO 14025 & ISO 14040s).

As such, in 2014, an initial range of Somfy products were granted a

PEP ecopassport®. They were part of the “motor controller” product

range for controlling motors in commercial buildings. The information

contained in this PEP ecopassport® has been independently verified by

Bureau Veritas CODDE.

Specific initiatives regarding internal communication were carried

out, aimed at Research and Development teams in particular, for the

purpose of including these eco-design requirements in all stages of
product creation.

In 2013, Somfy implemented actions in favour of collection and

processing networks for end-of-life products in the professional sector,

representing the majority of the volumes put on the market:

—In France, through a contract signed with RECYLUM, an organisation
authorised to process professional WEEE. This is the result of an
industry approach in which Somfy was a stakeholder;

—In Germany, through registration with the “ElektroAltgeraete Register”.

In 2014, Somfy continued in its efforts in this area through working

within the various professional bodies to improve the industry.

In 2014, Somfy Group continued to introduce eco-gestures and

eco-practices:

-A 100% electric vehicle was used for distributing mail between the
various sites in the Haute-Savoie region in France, in an area subject to
an Air Quality Protection Plan;

POLLUTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

— Initial measures were introduced under the partnership with Corabio
and the target of serving 5% local and organic products in Somfy’s
company restaurant in Cluses was achieved in June 2014;

-A Somfy Paper Charter was developed and published in order to
promote and make systematic the use of recycled paper for various
purposes (office printing, brochures, sales documentation, product
manuals, etc.);

-The continued reuse of laptop computers across Somfy SAS:
580 products handled in 2014 including 383 computers. The update
and removal of computer data is performed by a company promoting
the employment of disabled people. These computers and various
accessories are then reused, thereby breathing new life into them. In
2014, 89% of the equipment was reusable, with the remaining 11 sent
for recycling;

-Continued use of the car pooling site in Haute-Savoie. More than
120 Somfy employees use this private community to easily find a
co-driver amongst their colleagues;

-Somfy Germany has introduced working instructions and related
training for its production staff in relation to sorting waste;

— The SITEM factory located in Tunisia has led several initiatives regarding
reducing and processing waste and to promote energy efficiency:

* Replacement of cardboard packaging with reusable containers;

* Approximately 50 people were involved in working groups or training
on processing production waste and energy efficiency;

* An energy performance assessment was made with measures taken
in relation to the performance of compressors and turning off air
conditioning overnight;

—In Italy, procedures have been established for the WAY factory
regarding waste collection and storage and measures were introduced
to reduce heat and lighting consumption;

—In the US, Somfy Systems has installed light sensors to change lighting
consumption;

—In Italy, BFT has a structure involving “expert” operators who relay
instructions about sorting and reducing waste in manufacturing areas.
This happens through monthly meetings and general communication
with staff. Measures have also been implemented in relation to eco-
design with priority accorded to reducing the energy consumption of
products, to packaging and recyclable oils.

Internal communication initiatives continued in 2014 in support of

corporate initiatives. They took the form of articles in the various in-house

magazines, both in video and paper format (for example, in the in-house
magazine “Imagine” printed in five languages and available to all Somfy
employees), specific events or information meetings at the sites.

Topics discussed included, amongst others:

—The presentation of our eco-design policy: its incorporation into
projects, its technical criteria, its formats and aims,

— Receipt of the first PEP ecopassport®,

—The sorting of waste in production areas in Somfy’s various factories.

SITEM conducted an energy audit of its buildings and in this way
implemented initiatives to improve the performance of its compressors
and reduce overnight air conditioning consumption.

Simu SAS carried out insulation works in its industrial buildings and
modernisation of the heating systems in its workshops.

High efficiency boilers were installed at the Somfy SAS site in Cluses,
France.

LAND USE

There are no mining operations on any Somfy’s sites.

Our plants have HOSHIN or 5S workshops in order to optimise the
footprint of the sites. A team of specialists, integrated into the Group’s
Industrial Management, is dedicated to leading these projects at the
Group’s plants.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Our industrial activities do not present any risks linked to climate change,
whether they relate to the growing scarcity of water, rising sea levels or
the rise in temperature.

CO, emissions from our operations totalled 5,838 tonnes in 2014. They
included electricity, gas and mineral fuel emissions.

PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY

No site is located within or bordering a protected area that requires
specific measures.

Nevertheless, Somfy SAS owns several sites in the heart of the French
Alps, near Mont Blanc. Somfy Group wants to act to protect the
mountain’s eco-systems and is involved in local initiatives such as the
“Club d’Entreprises pour la Montagne et son Développement Durable”
(CEM2D) (Club of businesses supporting the mountain and its sustainable
development). A charter was notably developed in 2013.

SOCIETAL INFORMATION

TERRITORIAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF COMPANY
ACTIVITIES

Employment and regional development

Leader in its fields of activity, Somfy Group contributes to local
employment in all the areas where it is located. The new industrial site
SOPEM in Poland opened in 2013 created 138 new jobs. 98% of positions,
including most supervisory roles, have been filled by Polish employees.
In Tunisia, the production company SITEM continued its recruitment
policy and currently employs a workforce of 881.

In 2014, Somfy Group continued to create jobs in France and particularly
in the Rhéne-Alpes region, where its business has traditionally been
located. Somfy Group is a provider of direct employment in its research
and development centres, its production facilities and the service
entities located throughout France. Somfy Group also contributes
indirectly to job creation via its subcontractors and suppliers.

On neighbouring and local populations

In order to promote regional development, Somfy Group has committed
to support the daily life of schools and higher education establishments
in the Rhéne-Alpes region. In this way, Somfy Group is a founding
member of the Partner Companies Club of the Universities of Savoie
(“Club des Entreprises Partenaires des Universités de Savoie”).

In 2014, Somfy Group welcomed students from this university on work
placement or work-study contracts.

Since 2012, Somfy Group has chaired the Board of the Ecole Polytech
Annecy Chambéry; the University of Savoie’s engineering school. In
2014, Somfy was involved in the renewal application for the authority to
issue engineering degrees before the Commission des Titres d’Ingénieur
(Commission for Engineering Qualifications), as well as in defining the
school’s strategic policy directions.

Somfy Group is heavily involved in Competitiveness Centres and technology
clusters active in the Arve valley (Haute-Savoie), where the Group’s
historical sites are located. Somfy Group is an active participant in Mont-
Blanc Industries, the Competitiveness Centre; Thésame, the technological
network for mechatronics businesses, the Public Interest Group MIND, an
innovative Franco-Swiss platform specialised in the field of mechatronics.
In 2014, Somfy Group launched the research and development project
COMETE (ClOud pour la Maison intelligente et |’EfficaciTé Energétique/
Cloud for the smart home and energy efficiency), whose purpose is
to develop home automation systems aimed at improving the energy
efficiency of buildings. The project brings together eight partners,
businesses and research laboratories from the Rhéne-Alpes region.
COMETE is financially supported by the State, the Rhdne-Alpes Region,
the Haute-Savoie and Isére departmental councils, and the Communauté
de Communes (federation of local councils) of Grésivaudan. After three
years of this project’s development, Somfy Group believes that COMETE
will lead to the creation of 40 local jobs.

A sponsor of the French Biathlon Teams since 2005, Somfy Group
sought to exercise its responsibilities towards athletes by helping them
to prepare for their post sporting careers. 2014 saw the launch of the
Somfy Ski Talents programme, whose aim is to support young skiers
selected in combination with the French Skiing Federation, in order to
help them prepare for their future professional life. With the help of
companies and the General Council of the Haute-Savoie region, Somfy
Group created the organisation Rebondir, to support the region’s
athletes in their career transition.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE OR ORGANISATIONS INTERESTED
IN THE COMPANY’S ACTIVITIES

The Group detailed its strategy towards its stakeholders based on the
analysis of the concerns and expectations of each. In 2014, Somfy
Group maintained a regular and constructive dialogue with priority
stakeholders and in particular its employees, shareholders, investors,
customers, suppliers and regional authorities.

As part of the Group’s Human Resources policy, several tools to promote
dialogue are implemented with employees at a collective and individual
level: satisfaction and commitment surveys, and individual interviews
and employee appraisals. The 2014 edition of the Group employee
satisfaction survey 2014 achieved a response rate of 79%. The employee
commitment indicator rose three percentage points in comparison
with the in-house survey conducted in 2012. In 2014, unions and
management held wide-ranging negotiations in order to define the basis
for a framework agreement on facilitating social dialogue.

In relation to shareholders, compliance with governance rules ensures a
structured dialogue on the Group’s performance targets and its strategy.
For investors, Somfy Group rolled out throughout the year an action
plan to provide them with reliable and high quality information.

The Suppliers Quality System includes an information and exchange
mechanism covering topics including social and environmental
responsibility.

Being responsive to professional customers and end users is a strategic
priority for Somfy Group and it is structured within a programme called
“Customer First”. For each customer profile, Somfy Group has developed
dialogue activities — studies, surveys, training, services — tailored to the
expectations of these stakeholders.

Involved in the development of the areas in which the Group is located,
Somfy Group has promoted dialogue in France with the various levels of
public decision-making to contribute to structured policies in the areas
of education, the use of research and sustainable development or to
support cultural and sporting projects for local people.

SUB-CONTRACTING AND SUPPLIERS

Suppliers and sub-contracting are important for Somfy Group due to the
nature of its industrial activity which is essentially assembly. Indeed, all
the components that form part of the composition of the products are
purchased components.

In order to make progress in relation to responsible purchasing, Somfy
Group, in collaboration with other manufacturers, has developed a
maturity frame of reference in relation to collective and responsible
purchasing: this framework incorporates the central issues of the
standard, ISO 26000.
This work was carried out within the framework of PEAK, a business
Research and Training network aimed at developing collaborative
customer supplier relationships.
Somfy Group has begun to introduce measures to make sure that
its suppliers and sub-contractors are socially and environmentally
responsible. Thus, Somfy has auditors who assess suppliers prior to their
admittance to the panel. These audits are conducted on the basis of a
questionnaire that includes questions on the following topics:
— Existence of an environmental policy,
— Planning to ensure that products conform to environmental requirements,
— Existence of a health and safety policy and consideration of ergonomic
and safety aspects in the design of workstations.
These questions are rated, with the ratings forming part of the final
assessment score of the supplier. If significant variations are discovered,
relating for example to safety in the workplace, Somfy Group may ask
the supplier to take corrective action.
For every component developed by a supplier, Somfy Group requests a
written undertaking relating to the European Directives REACH and ROHS.
In accordance with the regulations adopted by the US Securities and
Exchange Commission in 2012, Somfy Group implemented its duty
of diligence in respect of its supply chain, in order to ensure that the
supplies used in its products do not contain any “conflict minerals”.

FAIR PRACTICES

Somfy Group seeks to respect the regulations of the countries in which
it operates in relation to organisation of work, whilst subscribing to
the principles and objectives of the fundamental conventions of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO). As such, the Group’s Ethics
Charter, finalised in 2014, specifically reaffirms the fact that the
company rejects all illegal child labour and the use of forced labour,
seeks to establish constructive social dialogue and rejects all forms of
discrimination and corruption, whether active or passive.

In 2015, this Ethics Charter will be published in 14 languages, to facilitate
the adoption of the Group’s Ethics Charter by all its employees.

MEASURES PROMOTING CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

Ensuring the safety of the users of its products is a top priority for Somfy
Group. Alongside other leading companies in the electrical industry
and the building shutters sector, Somfy Group is heavily involved
in standardisation in order to ensure that the good safety practices
implemented in relation to product development are maintained. This
action operates on an international (IEC standards), European (CENELEC
and CEN standards) or local (UL standard for the United States for
example) scale. To show that its products comply with safety standards,
Somfy Group’s products are accredited by independent bodies in its
different territories (VDE, NF, SASO, UL, etc.).

Somfy Group ensures that its products comply with the standards and
requirements in place within its markets through a Quality Management
system. To control the performance and safety of its product installations,
Somfy Group has developed a network of expert installers throughout
the areas in which the Group is located. These specialists benefit from
professional training to help ensure that the products are installed under
optimum safety conditions both for the installer and users. In 2014, the
Somfy France Training Centre trained 2,500 professionals (installers,
manufacturers, distributors and integrators).

Every product is accompanied by installation and usage instructions.

A CITIZEN’S POLICY INVOLVING EMPLOYEES

Through the Somfy Foundation, the Group is pursuing its civic action in
its field of business where it is strongest: the fight against poor housing,

SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT / 2014 31

04 / MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT


--- Page 21 ---

04 / MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

in keeping with the strategic mission to improve living environments

driven by Somfy.

In 2014, the Foundation’s budget of €400,000 was used to finance three

major programmes:

-Confirmation of support for the Emmaiis France charity, with the
renewal for the fourth consecutive year of an annual agreement
providing for a financial contribution to Emmatis communities’
building rehabilitation projects, in order to improve the living and
working conditions of the people employed by this charity. In 2014,
three communities were supported in Cernay, Saint Herblain and Paris;

— The development of the online crowd funding platform created in 2013
(www.lespetitespierres.org) enabling anyone to donate to community
projects in the area of access to decent housing. A year after its launch,
the “Petites Pierres” platform has enabled 25 projects to be funded,
for a total sum of €250,000. The association Admical, which brings
together those involved in sponsorship in France, granted the Social
Innovation Award to the Petites Pierres initiative;

-Continuation of a participation programme for Somfy Group
employees, “Time for Others” (“Un Temps pour les Autres”). This
programme provides associations with the skills and drive of Somfy
Group employees by offering the latter the opportunity to take
part, during working hours, in solidarity action days on behalf of
associations. In 2014, employees had the chance to be involved in 38
solidarity days, with 81 people taking part.

In December 2014, the Somfy Foundation launched an international
programme to support the fight against poor housing. Called “A House is
aHome”, it corresponds to Somfy’s drive to assume its civic responsibility
in all the countries in which the Group operates. With an agreement
signed with the NGO Habitat for Humanity, a first initiative was launched
in Brazil for families with inadequate housing.

METHODOLOGY NOTE

REPORTING PROTOCOL

Somfy Groups’ CSR reporting protocol is the reference guide for all those
involved in CSR reporting within the Group. It is drawn up in French and
English. Its purpose is to define all the Group’s CSR indicators along with
their method of calculation, and to describe the procedures for their
collection and for reporting in order to promote the consistency and
comparability of data. This document is distributed to and applied at
all levels of data preparation and reporting. The reporting protocol is
updated annually to take into account Group developments.

The CSR reporting protocol also serves as a reference framework for the
external verification of data, in accordance with Article L. 225-102-1 of
the Commercial Code (“Grenelle 2” law). It is available on request from
Head Office.

SELECTION OF INDICATORS

Somfy Group’s indicators were defined by the CSR officers for each
area in line with the Group’s CSR strategy and the resulting social,
environmental and societal objectives. They facilitate the monitoring of
the CSR policy’s progress in each of the improvement areas identified
by the Group and the transparent communication of the Group’s CSR
performance in this report.

The indicators used comply with the Grenelle II decree and are based on
the general principles of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) guidelines.

COLLECTION, INTERNAL CONTROL AND CONSOLIDATION

The collection of CSR indicators is ensured by the CSR officers within
their respective fields of expertise. They rely on their network of local
experts who provide the data.

The CSR officers are also responsible for the consistency and plausibility
of the data prior to its consolidation in order to generate the Group
indicators included in the CSR section of the management report.

REPORTING PERIOD

The data collected covers the period from 1 January to 31 December
2014.

Depending on the indicators, it can relate to:

— An annual consolidation of the data from 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2014,
—The data measured at 31/12/2014.

Where historical information is available, data is reported on the last
two closed financial years.

REPORTING SCOPE

Companies which are controlled by the Group and fully consolidated
within the financial reporting scope are included within the financial
reporting scope. The concept of control means the power to govern
the financial and operational policies of an affiliated company so as to
benefit from its operations. Control is generally deemed to exist where
the Group holds more than half of the controlled company’s voting
rights.

Newly acquired companies are integrated into the reporting scope
following a probationary period necessary for the introduction of
reporting.

Companies which were sold during the financial year are not included
within the reporting scope.

Specifics of the scope for 2014 reporting:

The reporting scope taken into account for the 2014 financial year was
restricted to the following entities:

—Somfy SAS (France),

— Simu SAS (France),

— SITEM SARL (Tunisia),

— LianDa (China),

—Somfy China Co Ltd (China),

—Somfy GmbH (Germany),

—Somfy Systems Inc. (US),

— BFT SpA (Italy),

—Somfy Italia SRL (Italy),

— WAY SRL (Italy).

The Somfy Participations division was the subject of a demerger in
December 2014. Since Zurfliih-Feller and Sirem form part of the scope
that was sold, they are therefore not included in 2014 reporting.

For reasons of organisation and access to information, certain Group
companies have not yet been included. For future years, the Group
wishes to use perimeters that are more relevant depending on the topics
covered and is setting itself the short-term objective of incorporating all
the companies that it fully owns.

It may be recalled that the 2013 reporting scope included the following
companies:

—Somfy SAS (France),

— Simu SAS (France),

— Sirem (France),

—Zurfliih-Feller (France),

—SITEM SARL (Tunisia),

— LianDa (China),

—Somfy GmbH (Germany),

—Somfy Systems Inc. (US),

— BFT SpA (Italy).

METHODOLOGY LIMITATIONS

The methodologies used for the reporting of certain CSR indicators may

present limitations due to:

— Particularities of local legislation in the various countries in which the
Group is located,

— Lack of availability of information on certain perimeters,

— Use of estimates in the absence of assessment tools,

— Practicalities of collecting and processing data.

SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT / 2014


--- Page 24 ---

The General Meeting of 13 May 2015 will be asked to renew the
authorisations regarding the allocation of purchase options and existing
free shares which expire on 14 July 2015, according to the terms and
conditions set out below:

AUTHORISATION TO BE GRANTED TO THE MANAGEMENT
BOARD TO ALLOCATE STOCK OPTIONS TO EMPLOYEES
AND/OR CERTAIN CORPORATE OFFICERS

(ninth resolution)

You are therefore asked to renew the authorisation granted to the
Management Board, for a period of 38 months, to grant stock options to
employees, to certain categories of employees, and/or corporate officers
as defined by law, of the company or related companies or affiliated
economic interest groups under the conditions of Article L. 225-180 of
the Commercial Code.

The total number of options that may be granted by the Management
Board under this authorisation may not entitle beneficiaries to purchase
more than 1.5% of the share capital outstanding on the date of this
General Meeting, it being specified that this limit would count towards
the total number of shares that may be granted free of charge by the
Management Board under the following authorisation.

The purchase price of the shares by the beneficiaries would be set on
the date options would be granted by the Management Board, pursuant
to Article L. 225-177 paragraph 4 and Article L. 225-179 paragraph 2 of
the Commercial Code, and might not be lower than the average closing
price of the last 20 trading days of the share on Euronext Paris preceding
the date options would be allocated

The term of the options set by the Management Board may not exceed
a period of six years from their date of allocation.

As such, the Management Board would have, within the limits set
above, all necessary powers to determine the other conditions and
arrangements for the allocation of the options and their exercise and
notably to set the conditions under which the options will be granted
and to approve the list or categories of beneficiaries as provided for
above, to set the period(s) during which the options thereby granted
may be exercised and generally do anything that may be required in this
regard.

This new authorisation would terminate in advance the existing
authorisation with the same purpose.

AUTHORISATION TO BE GRANTED TO THE MANAGEMENT
BOARD TO ALLOCATE EXISTING SHARES FREE OF CHARGE
TO EMPLOYEES AND/OR TO CERTAIN CORPORATE
OFFICERS (tenth resolution)

You are also asked to authorise the Management Board, for a period
of 38 months, to effect, under Article L. 225-197-1 of the Commercial
Code, the free allocation of existing shares.
The beneficiaries of these allocations may be:
— Employees of the company or companies directly or indirectly related
to it within the meaning of Article L. 225-197-2 of the Commercial Code,
— Corporate officers meeting the conditions of Article L. 225-197-1 of the
Commercial Code.
The number of shares that may be granted free of charge by the
Management Board by virtue of this authorisation may not exceed 1.5%
of the share capital outstanding on the date of this General Meeting,
it being specified that this limit would count towards the total number
of shares that may be issued following the exercise of options to be
granted by Management Board under the above authorisation.
The allocation of shares to the beneficiaries would be final at the end of
a vesting period, the duration of which will be set by the Management
Board. This period may not be less than the minimum period provided
for by the law. The beneficiaries would subsequently have to retain
these shares for a period set by the Management Board, which may not
be less than the minimum period provided for by the law. The total of
the vesting and retention periods may not be less than the minimum
period provided for by the law.

As an exception, the final allocation would take place before the
end of the vesting period in the event of the beneficiary’s infirmity
corresponding to the second or third category referred to in Article L.
341-4 of the Social Security Code.

The Management Board would thereby have, within the limits set above,
all necessary powers to set the conditions and, where necessary, the
criteria for the allocation of the shares; to determine the identity of the
beneficiaries of the free shares from the people who fulfil the conditions
set above as well as the number of shares to be granted to each of them;
to acquire the shares required as part of the share buyback programme
and to allot them to the allocation plan; to determine, where necessary,
the impact on the rights of beneficiaries of transactions modifying the
share capital or likely to impact the value of the shares to be allocated and
realised during the vesting period; to take all appropriate measures to
ensure compliance with the retention obligation, if necessary, required
of beneficiaries; and generally, do anything within the framework of
current regulations that may be required by the implementation of this
regulation.

This new authorisation would terminate in advance the existing
authorisation with the same purpose.

Moreover, you are asked to approve a PEE (Company Savings Plan)
authorisation as part of the triennial obligation, with no authorisation
having been submitted to shareholders since the General Meeting of
15 May 2012, in accordance with the terms and conditions detailed
hereafter:

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE SHARE
CAPITAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF MEMBERS OF A COMPANY
SAVINGS PLAN (eleventh resolution)

Also submitted to you will be an authorisation to increase the share
capital for the benefit of members of a Company Savings Plan, in
order to comply with the provisions of the second paragraph of Article
L.225-129-6 of the Commercial Code, under which terms the
Extraordinary General Meeting must vote, at least every three years, on
a resolution to increase the share capital under the conditions provided
for by Articles L. 3332-18 and subsequent of the Labour Code.

As part of this authorisation, you are asked to allow the Management
Board to increase the share capital on one or more occasions through
the issue of ordinary shares or marketable securities giving access to
the share capital of the company to benefit members of one or more
company or Group savings plans set up by the company and/or affiliated
French or foreign companies under the conditions of Article L. 225-180
of the Commercial Code and Article L. 3344-1 of the Labour Code.

In application of the provisions of Article L. 3332-21 of the Labour
Code, the Management Board may provide for the allocation, to the
beneficiaries, of free shares to be issued or already issued, or other
shares granting access to the share capital of the company to be issued
or already issued, in respect of (i) the employer’s contribution that may
be paid pursuant to the regulations relating to company or group savings
plans, and/or (ii), where applicable, the discount.

In accordance with the law, the General Meeting would cancel the pre-
emption rights of shareholders.

The maximum nominal amount of capital increases that may be carried
out through the use of this authorisation would be €500,000, this
amount being independent of any other limit set by other delegations
to increase capital. An additional number of ordinary shares to be
issued in order to maintain, in accordance with the law and any
potential applicable contractual provisions that provide for other cases
of adjustment, the rights of the holders of the marketable securities
granting access to the company’s equity securities would be added to
this amount where necessary.

This authorisation would last for a period of 26 months.

It is specified that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 3332-
19 of the Labour Code, the price of the shares to be issued may not
be more than 20% (or 30% when the lock-up period provided for by
the plan under Articles L. 3332-25 and L. 3332-26 of the Labour Code is

greater than or equal to ten years) less than the average of the share’s
opening prices quoted during the 20 stock exchange sessions preceding
the Management Board’s decision relating to the share capital increase
and the issue of the corresponding shares, nor higher than this average.
The Management Board would have, within the limits set above, the
necessary powers notably to set the conditions of the issue(s), record
the completion of the resulting capital increases, amend the bylaws
accordingly, charge, at its sole discretion, the costs of the capital
increases against the related premiums and deduct from such amount
the sums necessary to take the statutory reserve to one tenth of the
new share capital after each increase, and more generally, do whatever
is necessary in such matters.

Nevertheless, inasmuch as this authorisation appears neither relevant
nor timely, the Management Board suggests that you reject it.

INFORMATION ON PAYMENT TERMS
(ARTICLE L. 441-6-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

At 31 December 2014 as at 31 December 2013, there were no liabilities
due but unpaid to Somfy SA suppliers.

Trade receivables specific to Somfy SA’s activity represent payment
terms generally less than forty-five days from the end of the month.

INFORMATION ON RISKS
(ARTICLE L. 225-100 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

FINANCIAL RISKS

The main financial risks to which the Somfy Group is exposed are foreign
exchange, interest rate, liquidity and investment risks.

According to IFRS, all derivative financial instruments are measured
at their fair value. Fair value is either the market value for listed
instruments, or a value provided by financial institutions in accordance
with traditional criteria (over-the-counter market). The amounts covered
exclusively relate to current or future transactions within the framework
of Somfy Group’s normal business activities.

As part of the transposition of the MIF Directive that came into force on
1 November 2007, Somfy SA and its French subsidiaries opted for the
“individual clients” category.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Somfy Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related
to its operational activities (intragroup sales of manufactured products
distributed by commercial subsidiaries outside the Euro zone and
purchases denominated in local currencies).

At comparable terms and conditions, the Group gives priority to
natural hedges (foreign currency purchases related to sales in the
same currency). The derivative financial instruments implemented are
forward exchange and NDF (non deliverable forward) contracts.

The management of foreign exchange risk is covered in note 23 to the
consolidated financial statements.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Somfy Group is exposed to risks associated with the effect of fluctuations
in interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed at the Group level, based
on consolidated debt and taking into consideration market conditions.
The main objective of the interest rate risk management policy is to
control the Group’s financing cost.

At 31 December 2013, the hedging instruments were mainly implemented
in the companies within the Somfy Participations group to hedge liabilities
entered into within the framework of the LBO.

Due to the demerger of Somfy Activities and Somfy Participations in
December 2014, at the reporting date, the Group no longer had interest
rate hedging instruments.

The management of the interest rate risk is covered in note 23 to the
consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Somfy Group must have permanent access to the necessary financial

resources to allow it to finance its day-to-day activities and its

investments. The Group’s liquidity risk primarily arises from the

obligation to repay its existing debt, the funding of its future resource

requirements and observance of its financial ratios.

Funds made available by the credit institutions are subject to Somfy’s SA

commitment to comply with two types of financial covenants based on:

-The Group’s financial structure (net financial debt/shareholder’s
equity) and,

— Its ability to repay (net financial debt/cash flow and net financial debt/
EBITDA).

For CIAT, the LBO liability is subject to compliance with covenants

contracted at the time the finance packages were negotiated.

The management of liquidity risk is covered in note 23 to the consolidated

financial statements.

Credit facilities and compliance with covenants are detailed in note 20.6

to the consolidated financial statements.

INVESTMENT RISK

The Group’s exposure to investment risk is related to its cash surplus
deposited with banks.

The management of investment risk is covered in note 23 to the
consolidated financial statements.

RAW MATERIAL RISKS

Somfy Group hedges against the volatility in the price of raw materials
that are significantly used in the manufacturing of its products by placing
firm orders with its suppliers, depending on market conditions.

SHARE RISKS

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury shares. Given the share
price, it was not necessary to record a provision for writedown at
31 December 2014.

LEGAL RISKS

Somfy Group’s operations are not subject to specific regulations. Its
business does not require a specific legal or regulatory authorisation with
the exception of the compulsory listing on the Register of Companies
and stock exchange regulations.

Somfy Group is involved in a number of disputes in respect of its
business. These should not have any significant negative impact on the
Group’s financial position.

To the Group’s knowledge, there were no exceptional events or
litigation likely to have a significant negative impact on the Group’s or its
subsidiaries’ operations, assets or results, other than those mentioned
in the highlights of the year.

INSURANCE — RISK COVERAGE

Somfy Group covers the main risks with the following insurance policies:

— “Property damage”, covering buildings and their contents (equipment,
goods, IT equipment) up to the maximum amount of damage likely to
be incurred;

— “Resulting loss of profit”,

Risks insured by these two policies include fire, explosions, lightning,

smoke, emissions, steam, impacts from airborne objects, electrical

risks, storms, snow, hail, water damage, frost, machine breakage, IT

equipment theft, natural disasters and other non-designated events;

36 SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT / 2014


--- Page 26 ---

- “General civil liability relating to monetary consequences of an
insured entity’s liability following physical injury, property damage
or moral prejudice caused to a third party during or in relation to its
operations”;

— “Directors’ civil liability”;

— “Transported goods”;

- In addition, credit insurance contracts, both in France and
internationally, mitigate the consequences of customer default.
Approximately 50% of total sales are covered by such contracts.

COUNTRY RISK

The majority of operations occur in safe areas such as Europe, the
United States and Asia.
The Group does not operate in any significant hyperinflationary country.

CLIMATE RISK

Due to the nature of the products marketed (notably motors for blinds),
Somfy Group’s activity is partly connected to weather conditions, in
particular during the first half of the year, during which sales of motors
for blinds are concentrated.

CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK

Customer credit risk is linked to the receivables portfolio and the
sometimes challenging economic environment in certain parts of
the world. Nevertheless, customer profile, the Group’s international
geographic presence and the credit insurance cover help to mitigate this
risk.

The analysis of credit risk is covered in note 16 to the consolidated
financial statements.

INFORMATION ON NON-DEDUCTIBLE
CHARGES (ARTICLES 39-4 AND 223 QUATER
OF THE GENERAL TAX CODE)

The financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2014
do not include any non-allowable charges with regard to the income tax
base, as defined by Articles 39-4 and 223 IV of the General Tax Code.

ALLOCATION OF NET PROFIT

The Management Board proposes to allocate the net profit of

€104,595,986.28 for the year ended 31 December 2014, increased by

retained earnings of €22,147,574.40, to a total of €126,743,560.68, as

follows:

— Allocation to shareholders of a gross dividend of
€5.20 per share, being €5.20 x 7,836,800 shares

— Transfer to optional reserve

€40,751,360.00
€85,992,200.68

€126,743,560.68

A gross dividend of €5.20 will be distributed for each share with a
par value of €1, and this carries the right to a tax rebate granted to
individuals subject to income tax in France, in accordance with Article
158-3-2° of the General Tax Code.

Shares held by the company on the ex-dividend date are not entitled to
dividends, with the corresponding amount of unpaid dividends being
transferred to retained earnings.

The dividend will be payable on 4 June 2015; the shares must be held on
2 June 2015 (ex-dividend date) to benefit from the dividend.

In accordance with legal provisions, it should be noted that the following
dividends were paid during the last three financial years:

Dividends are fully eligible for the tax rebate and no other revenue was paid for
the 2011, 2012 and 2013 financial years.

Moreover, it is noted that the General Meeting of Shareholders held on
27 November 2014 decided the exceptional distribution of €391,840,000
which was taken from the “General Reserve”, it being specified that each
Somfy share conferred entitlement to either one Edify SA share or a cash
payment of €50, according to the shareholder’s preference. When it
concerned individual shareholders resident in France for tax purposes,
this exceptional distribution was eligible for the 40% rebate provided for
by Article 158-2-3 of the General Tax Code.

REGULATED AGREEMENTS

Please note that no new agreements of the same nature as those
referred to in Articles L. 225-86 and subsequent of the Commercial Code
were concluded during the 2014 financial year.

STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE

During the 2014 financial year, the Somfy SA share price increased by
12.43%. At 31 December 2013, the last trading day before the close of
the previous financial year, the share price was €185, compared with
€208 at 31 December 2014.

Based on this last share price and taking account of a gross dividend per
share of €5.20, the Somfy SA share yielded 2.5%.

35,589 and low of 11,268 per month, with a monthly average of 21,184
