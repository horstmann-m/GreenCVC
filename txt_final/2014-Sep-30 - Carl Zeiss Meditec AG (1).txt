CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Consolidated management report

for financial year 2013/2014"

THE CARL ZEISS MEDITEC GROUP
Business

A distinction is made within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
essentially between two main areas in which the Company
operates: Ophthalmology and Microsurgery.

Ophthalmology

Ophthalmic equipment and systems offered by the Company
are used for the diagnosis, progress control, treatment and
follow-up treatment of different ophthalmic conditions. These
are vision defects (refraction), cataracts, glaucoma and retinal
disorders, the incidence of which increases particularly with
age. The various diseases each occur in different sections
within the human eye. The lens, among other things, can be
affected, in that it gradually begins to turn opaque, as is the
case with cataracts. Retinal diseases can also impair the vision
of the human eye and can even cause irreparable damage or,
ultimately, blindness.

Ophthalmology within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group brings
together the two strategic business units (SBUs) “Ophthalmic
Systems” and “Surgical Ophthalmology”. The “Ophthalmic
Systems” SBU covers almost the entire spectrum of laser

and diagnostic systems for ophthalmology. The “Surgical
Ophthalmology” SBU combines the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's
activities in the field of ophthalmic implants (intraocular lenses
or IOLs) and consumables.

Microsurgery

In the “Microsurgery” SBU, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group offers
surgical microscopes and visualization solutions, e.g. for ear,
nose and throat surgery, or neurosurgery. These products are
mainly used to assist with the removal of tumors, as well

as the treatment of vascular diseases and functional disorders.
In addition, in the financial year under review this SBU

also offered various products for ophthalmic surgery, such as
surgical microscopes and visualization systems for displaying
the retina. The future technologies for intraoperative radiation
therapy have also been assigned to this SBU.

' This management report contains certain forward-looking statements concerning the development of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. At the present time, we assume
that these forward-looking statements are realistic. However, such forward-looking statements are based both on assumptions and estimates that are subject to risks
and uncertainties, which may lead to the actual results differing significantly from the expected results. We therefore assume no liability for such a deviation. There
are no plans to update the forward-looking statements for events that occur after the end of the reporting period.

Apparent addition discrepancies may arise throughout this annual report due to mathematical rounding.

Group strategy

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has set itself the task of
developing innovative products to improve the diagnosis

and treatment of diseases. The solutions the Company
develops aim to improve the treatment result, simplify clinical
workflows and, ultimately, reduce costs of treatment. They
also allow physicians to focus all their attention on their work
and their patients. After all, our aim in the end is for the
patient to leave the clinic with the best possible outcome
and a high level of satisfaction

Our corporate strategy therefore focuses on the success
factors “Innovation”, “Workflow Solutions” and “Customer
Focus”. The focus is therefore on making cutting-edge
technology in medical application accessible to customers.
The Company is therefore striving to establish its products

as new gold standards in medical diagnostics and therapy. The
broad product range, on the one hand, and the integration

of the devices into specially developed data management and
analysis platforms, on the other, aim to generate value-added
for the customer. The objective is to fully reproduce workflows
at our customers and thus increase efficiency in daily practice.
The customers of Carl Zeiss Meditec value the support and
service, in order to be able to satisfy the ever-growing demands
for treatment quality and efficiency. At the same time, Carl
Zeiss Meditec’s customers are important partners for us to
develop products according to the requirements of the market.
Another key growth driver over the next few years shall
therefore be the constant contact the Company has with its
customers through the continuous expansion of its global
service business.

Group management

The overriding corporate objective is to contribute to

the advancement of medical technology with targeted
innovations and thus generate long-term value-added for the
Group. The tools for the financial management of the Carl
Zeiss Meditec Group comprise a comprehensive system of key
performance indicators. The greatest importance is attached
to Economic Value Added® ("EVA®")?, free cash flow?, the EBIT
margin and revenue growth. These control ratios define the
balance between growth, profitability and financial power,
upon which sustainable growth of the Company is built.

These are supplemented by strategic measures and projects in
the areas of customer excellence, people/performance culture
and operational excellence.

BUSINESS REPORT
Underlying conditions for business development

Macroeconomic conditions

Global economic growth in the reporting period was more
restrained than forecast. The dynamic markets of Asia, for
example India and China, continued to grow at an above-
average rate, if also slower than anticipated. The markets of
Latin America — particularly Brazil -— showed a slowdown in
growth. Market growth in the industrialized countries was
moderate in financial year 2013/2014, although the revival
in the USA was less pronounced than expected. The euro
crisis continued to be a major political and economic issue,
which had an adverse effect on industry and public sector
investment activities.

Situation in the medical technology sector

Medical technology is one of the fast-growing sectors in the
medium to long term. This is due, firstly, to the ever-growing
global population and, secondly, to the increasing proportion
of older people in the overall population. This means that the
total number of patients suffering from age-related diseases is
continuously rising. At the same time, there is a growing need
for comprehensive and high-quality health care.

2 Calculation: FCF = EBIT +/- changes in trade receivables +/- changes in inventories, including advance payments +/- changes in provisions (excluding provisions for
pensions and tax provisions) +/- changes in current accrued liabilities +/- changes in trade payables [- increase in investments in property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets] [+ write down of investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets] = Free Cash Flow.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT


--- Page 5 ---

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

In the traditional selling markets of the western industrialized
nations it is assumed that the demand for higher-quality
medical technology innovations shall continue to rise, as a
result of more and more demanding consumer and patient
desires, due to a high income level and a growing tendency
to pursue health care services. At the same time, the higher
cost pressure in the main industrialized countries means there
is increasing demand for the development of effective devices
and efficient treatments.

The demand for health care goods and services in the RDEs
(rapidly developing economies) shall also increase as a result
of the rising per capita income and growing prosperity,
which will, in turn, create significant growth potential for the
medical technology sector in future. Increases in the volumes
of conventional medical technology and medical health

care products, in particular, shall play an increasingly more
important role here, due to improvements in the standard

of living.

It can therefore be assumed that the demand for diagnostic
and therapeutic products will continue to grow in the long
term, both in microsurgery and in ophthalmology.

a) Market for ophthalmic products

The market for ophthalmic products in the broader sense
includes devices and systems for the diagnosis, treatment
and post-treatment of ophthalmic diseases, implants for
ophthalmic surgery and pharmaceuticals for ophthalmology,
contact lenses, contact lens care products, consumables,
but excludes glasses and glasses frames. According to the
Company's estimates, the market had a global volume of
around USD 34.3 billion (about € 26.1 billion) in 2013.

The Group's product range includes devices and systems,
implants, consumables and instruments for ophthalmology
and ophthalmic surgery. According to the Group's estimates,
these sub-markets had a volume of around USD 9.4 billion,
or around € 7.2 billion, in 2013

The Company estimates its share of the “devices and systems
for ophthalmology” market segment, traditionally served by
the Company, at about 20% in 2013. In the market segment
“implants, consumables and instruments for ophthalmic
surgery”, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group estimates its global
market share in 2013 at about 3% to 4%. However,

our regional market shares in the countries the Company

is currently focusing on range between 5 % and 20%.

32

Based on the information at hand, the Group estimates that
it sustained its market share overall in the market segments it
addresses, in comparison with the previous year.

b) Market for microsurgery products

Besides ophthalmology, the Company also operates in the
market for microsurgery, particularly neuro/ear, nose and
throat surgery (“neuro/ENT surgery”). The overall neuro/ENT
surgery market is divided into three market segments:

“Implants”, “Surgical instruments” and “Visualization”.

In the “Visualization” market segment served by the Company
a distinction can be made between the sub-segments
“Surgical Microscopes” and “Other Visualization”. According
to the Group's estimates, this market segment had a total
volume of around USD 1.4 billion, or over € 1.0 billion, in
2013. With a market share which it estimates at over 20%,
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is one of the largest providers
in this segment. According to own estimates, the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group continues to be the global market leader in
the sub-segment “Surgical microscopes”, with a market share
of more than 50%.

Overall assertion on the financial position of the Group
at the end of the financial year

In financial year 2013/2014 the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
generated revenue of € 909.3 million, which is at the lower
end of the forecast range of € 910—€ 940 million. All three
strategic business units and regions contributed to this growth
to varying degrees.

The competitive situation in the strategic business unit
“Ophthalmic Systems” remained very tense during

the financial year. Certain sections of this SBU were therefore
faced with declining market shares. In the strategic business
unit “Surgical Ophthalmology”, on the other hand, the
Group further improved its position, as expected, with
revenue growth of over 20%. The strategic business unit
“Microsurgery” also found itself in a challenging environment
during the year, which was characterized by a slowdown in
growth. Nevertheless, the business unit maintained its leading
market position, as anticipated

Taking these challenges into consideration, the Company
considers the development of business to be satisfactory.


--- Page 6 ---

At 13.3%, the EBIT margin was down compared with the
previous year (previous year 14.6%). At the beginning of
the financial year, the Company was still aiming to stabilize
the EBIT margin at the level achieved. The decline that has
occurred since then compared with the previous year is
due, among other things, to the effects of acquisitions and
negative currency effects.

The aim to achieve operative cash flow in the high double-
digit million range was achieved by the Group in financial year
2013/2014, with € 63.1 million.

At € 93.6 million, free cash flow is almost on the previous
year’s level (previous year € 91.6 million).

EVA is down compared with the previous year, from

€ 65.8 million to € 41.7 million. This development is
attributable to a lower operating result (EBIT) than the
previous year, and to the increase in business assets,
particularly as a result of the acquisitions.

In order to increase its innovative strength, to ensure the
Company's future growth and sustainable performance, the
Company has up to now invested around 10-11 % of its
revenue each year in research and development (R&D), as
budgeted. R&D spending was also on this level in the past
financial year, amounting to 11.0 % of revenue.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group’s financial position remained
stable. This is also contributing towards the achievement of
the Company’s objectives, which are geared to sustainable
growth, and protects the Group against external influences.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

a) Consolidated revenue by strategic business unit

In the reporting year almost 84 % of total revenue was
attributable to the two largest strategic business units,
“Ophthalmic Systems” and “Microsurgery”. The “Ophthalmic
Systems” SBU accounted for 41.0% of this revenue (previous
year 43.1%). The “Microsurgery” SBU contributed 42.9 %
(previous year 43.5 %) of consolidated revenue. The share

of revenue generated by the “Surgical Ophthalmology”

SBU increased further, from 13.4% in the same period of

the previous year, to 16.1%.

Figure 3: Share of strategic business units in consolidated revenue in
financial year 2013/2014

Ophthalmic Systems SBU 41.0%
Surgical Ophthalmology SBU 16.1%
Microsurgery SBU 42.9% |

Revenue in the strategic business unit “Ophthalmic Systems”
declined by 4.6 % compared with the previous year, to

€ 372.9 million (previous year € 391.0 million). This revenue
decline was mainly due to negative currency effects; thus,
based on constant exchange rates, revenue was down

only slightly, by 1.8%, compared with the previous year.

The environment remained very difficult due to intense
competition, particularly in the diagnostic instruments
segment.

With an increase in revenue of 20.3%, from € 121.3 million

to € 146.0 million, the “Surgical Ophthalmology” SBU made
a very positive contribution to growth in the past financial

34

year. Even without taking the consolidation of Aaren Scientific
Inc. into account, the SBU achieved a clear double-digit
percentage organic growth rate. This business remained
largely unaffected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, so
that, based on constant exchange rates, revenue growth

was on almost the same level as the previous year, at 20.2%.

This business unit continued to benefit in particular from

the growing demand for innovative intraocular lenses and
multifocal and toric premium lenses for minimally invasive
cataract surgery. The AT LISA® tri toric, an advancement of the
AT LISA® tri with added astigmatism correction, established
itself very successfully on the market in the reporting period
following its launch at the beginning of financial year
2013/2014.

At the start of financial year 2013/2014 Carl Zeiss Meditec
Inc. had acquired 100% of the shares in the U.S. company
Aaren Scientific Inc., which is engaged in research and
development, and in the production and global distribution
of intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. This acquisition is an
important strategic step for Carl Zeiss Meditec Group in terms
of generating further growth in the “Surgical Ophthalmology”
SBU in future. At the end of financial year 2013/2014

the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group was already able to launch the
CT LUCIA®, the first intraocular lens in the standard segment
to be manufactured at the new site in Ontario.

The strategic business unit “Microsurgery” generated revenue
of € 390.4 million in the financial year under review (previous
year € 394.2 million), in spite of persistently high exchange
rate losses, and was therefore almost on a par with the
previous year (- 1.0%). Adjusted for currency effects, the SBU
grew by 2.2%. The strongest sales drivers were the surgical
microscopes for neurosurgery and ENT surgery.

b) Consolidated revenue by region

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has a very balanced range of
business activities worldwide, with each of its three business
regions generating around one third of its total revenue. In
the past financial year 36.1% of consolidated revenue was
attributable to the region “Europe, Middle East and Africa”
(“EMEA”). The “Americas” and “Asia/Pacific” (“APAC”)
regions accounted for 32.6% and 31.3%, respectively, of the
Group's total revenue. The “EMEA” and “APAC” regions made
a positive contribution to growth in financial year 2013/2014,
while the “Americas” region declined due, among other
things, to the strong previous year basis.

Figure 6: Consolidated revenue by region in financial year 2013/2014

EMEA 36.1%
Americas 32.6%
APAC 31.3%

The “EMEA” region increased its revenue by a total of 6.7%
(adjusted for currency effects: +6.6%), to € 328.1 million
(previous year € 307.6 million). A good level of overall growth
was achieved in the core markets, including Germany, France
and the United Kingdom. The countries of Southern Europe,
as a whole, and the Middle East, achieved growth. Revenue
growth in Russia, however — which contributed significantly
to this region's revenue growth in the past two years, due to
government investment schemes — was curtailed, as expected,
by the expiry of these investment schemes.

In the “Americas” region revenue decreased by 9.4% to

€ 296.8 million (previous year € 327.5 million). Adjusted for
currency effects, this decline amounted to 6.8%. A major
contributor to this decline was subdued growth in the U.S.
market following a strong performance the previous year.
Some countries of South America continued to grow.

Revenue in the “APAC” region grew by 4.8% in the year
under review, from € 271.4 million in the previous year to
€ 284.4 million. As expected, revenue growth in Japan was
volatile during the year, and slowed considerably in the
second half of the year, after a strong first six months, due,
among other things, to pull-forward effects in connection
with the VAT increase on 1 April 2014. Substantial

35

contributions to growth came from China and Australia.
Currency effects continued to have a noticeable impact in
this region, due, in particular, to the considerable volatility
of the Japanese yen in the reporting period. Adjusted for
currency effects, the region increased its revenue by 10.8%.

Gross profit

In financial year 2013/2014 gross profit increased from

€ 487.5 million to € 488.4 million. The corresponding gross
margin for the reporting period amounts to 53.7 % (previous
year 53.8%).

Functional costs

Functional costs for the first six months of the reporting year
amount to € 367.7 million (previous year € 354.8 million),
thus increasing slightly disproportionately to revenue, by
3.6%. Accordingly, the share of functional costs in revenue
increased, from 39.1% last year, to 40.4%. The absolute
increase in costs is mainly attributable to the acquisitions

of Aaren Scientific Inc. and Optronik A.S., as well as higher
brand licensing costs proportionate to revenue, which led
to an increase in selling and marketing expenses.

» Selling and marketing expenses: Selling and marketing
expenses increased by 5.2% in the year under review,

36

from € 215.0 million to € 226.1 million. The acquisitions

of Aaren Scientific Inc. and Optronik A.S., as well as higher
brand licensing costs, mainly resulted in a rise in selling and
marketing costs. In relation to sales revenues, selling and
marketing expenses increased slightly, to 24.9 % (previous
year 23.7 %)

General and administrative expenses: Expenses in this
area decreased slightly, by 1.0%, to € 41.8 million (previous
year € 42.2 million). Their share of revenue also decreased
slightly, from 4.7 % in the previous year, to 4.6%

Research and development expenses (R&D): The Carl
Zeiss Meditec Group continuously invests in R&D, in order
to further develop its product portfolio and ensure further
growth. R&D expenses increased by 2.2% in the first quarter,
to € 99.8 million (previous year € 97.6 million). The RED
ratio remained almost the same as in the previous year, at
11.0% (previous year 10.8%).


--- Page 10 ---

Development of earnings

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group uses earnings before

interest and taxes (EBIT = operating result) as a key
performance indicator. EBIT for the reporting period
amounts to € 120.7 million (previous year € 132.6 million).
This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 13.3% (previous year
14.6%). The decline compared with the previous year is
due, among other things, to the effects of acquisitions
Negative currency effects also reduced the operating result.

Interest income/expenses (net) amounted to € -0.06 million
in the reporting period (previous year € - 1.4 million).

Currency effects arose in the form of foreign currency losses
in the amount of € 5.7 million (previous year € 14.5 million),
mainly as a result of the valuation of currency forward
contracts as of 30 September 2014.

The tax rate for the reporting period amounts to 30.9%
(previous year 32.9%). Generally, an average annual tax
rate of between 31% and 33 % is assumed.

Consolidated net income attributable to shareholders
of the parent company for financial year 2013/2014

amounts to € 75.0 million and thus decreased by 18.6 %
(previous year € 92.1 million). This decline was to a large

extent due to negative valuation results from currency
hedging transactions, which were offset by gains in the
previous year. Non-controlling interests accounted for

€ 4.2 million of this (previous year € 5.6 million). In financial
year 2013/2014 basic earnings per share of the parent
company thus amount to € 0.92 (previous year € 1.13).

Financial position

Objectives and principles of financial management

A primary objective of financial management at the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group is to ensure the solvency of the Company and
to manage this efficiently throughout the Group. The Group's
main source of liquidity comes from the business operations
of the individual business units, upon which the financial
activities and the strategic orientation of the Group are also

37

based. The Company therefore operates a global financial
management system that encompasses all of its subsidiaries
and is centrally organized at Group level. The Company

also strives to continuously improve its financial power and
reduce financial risks by keeping a constant check on the
solvency of its debtors, which also involves the use of financial
instruments.

The Company deposits any liquidity it does not require

at normal market conditions with the Group treasury of

Carl Zeiss AG. When investing surplus liquidity, short-term
availability generally comes before the goal of maximizing
earnings, so that funds can be accessed quickly if, for
example, acquisition opportunities arise, as was the case at
the beginning of the reporting year. The Group has production
plants in the USA and Europe. This minimizes the effect of
currency fluctuation. The remaining currency risk is hedged

by simple futures trading. Details on these can be found in

the notes to the consolidated financial statements under “(2)
(h) Financial instruments”, “(26) Additional disclosures on
financial instruments”, “(35) Financial risk management, (2) (t)
and (32) “Related party disclosures”.

Financial management
The ratio of borrowed capital to equity increased to 37.8%
as of 30 September 2014 (30 September 2013: 37.4%).

The Group's dynamic debt ratio® stands at 1.5 years for
financial year 2013/2014 (previous year 0.8 years). The
Company is thus still in a position to settle is net debt within
less than one-and-a-half years using cash flow from its
operating activities.

The interest coverage ratio, i.e., the coverage of interest
income by the operating result before depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA), amounts to 137.1 (previous year 72.0).

Cash inflows generated from operating activities provide an
important source of financing for Carl Zeiss Meditec AG. The
parent company can also create additional liquidity by issuing
new shares on the capital market. Furthermore, the Group
has the option to assume loans either from the Group treasury
of Carl Zeiss AG or from banks.

For further information on the financial liabilities of Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG please refer to note “(23) Non-current financial
liabilities”, “(24) Current accrued liabilities” and “(25) Other

current non-financial liabilities” in the accompanying notes
to the consolidated financial statements

Since the Group possesses enough cash funds to finance
its operating and strategic objectives, changes in credit
conditions are not currently having any material effect on
the Company's financial situation.

Separate reporting on financial instruments

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to currency
fluctuation risks, due to its international business activities in
numerous different currencies. Significant currency risks are
hedged against with hedging transactions, based on a rolling
business plan.

Hedges are mainly transacted centrally by Carl Zeiss Financial
Services GmbH. The services provided by Carl Zeiss Financial
Services GmbH to Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries
are regulated by corresponding general agreements. The
hedges are processed by Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH
with external business banks. Hedges are processed exclusively
by banks with a high credit rating from leading agencies.
Value-at-risk analyses, together with scenario, sensitivity
and stress test analyses, are implemented during risk control
and monitoring to quantify the currency risks. Hedging rates
are specified for operative control of all relevant currencies.
In addition, limits were defined to limit risks relating to
contracting parties and transaction types. Contracts only
exist with renowned financial institutions with international
operations. Derivative financial instruments are not used for
speculative purposes.

The business transactions are executed with strict separation
of functions between the front office (trade), middle office
(financial risk management, controlling) and back office
(processing, documentation).

Statement of cash flows

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group’s statement of cash flows
shows the origin and utilization of the cash flows within a
financial year. The statement of cash flows is also presented
with adjustments for the effects of the acquisitions of Aaren
Scientific Inc. and Optronik A.S. A distinction is made between
cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from
investing and financing activities

Cash flow from operating activities amounted to € 63.1 million
in the reporting period (previous year € 64.6 million). The
amount of operative cash flow was determined primarily by
the smaller amount of consolidated net income compared
with the previous year. There was also a reduction in
receivables of € 16.0 million after receivables increased by

€ 45.5 million the previous year. Increased stockpiling of
inventories due, among other things, to the market launch

of a number of products at the end of the financial year, to
ensure quick delivery, but also due to the fall in revenue in the
fourth quarter, reduced operative cash flow by € 22.1 million.
A decrease in trade payables by € 7.5 million also had a
curtailing effect in financial year 2013/2014, following an
increase of € 8.7 million in this item in the previous year.
Higher tax payments than the previous year reduced cash
flow from operating activities further.

Cash flow from investing activities amounted to

€-49.4 million in the reporting period (previous year

€ -32.2 million). It should be noted, that there was a

higher outflow of cash during the reporting period than in
the previous year, due mainly to the acquisition of the
longstanding distribution partner Optronik A.S. in Turkey and
the U.S. intraocular lens manufacturer Aaren Scientific Inc

Cash flow from financing activities in the past financial

year 2013/2014 amounts to € -7.5 million (previous year

€ -34.2 million). The difference from the previous year is
mainly due to the change in treasury receivables from and
payables to the treasury of Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH

Investment and depreciation policy

In order to further expand our good market position in the
medical technology sector and achieve a leading market
position, we need to make well considered investments. A
distinction is made here between two types of investment:
capacity expansions and replacement investments. These
investments are financed from operative cash flow.

In terms of the production of devices and systems, the
Company mainly confines itself to the integration of individual
components to create system solutions. For this reason,

the ratio of property, plant and equipment to total assets

and investments in such property, plant and equipment is
comparatively low. One exception, however, is the production
of intraocular lenses, which generally demands higher
investments due to a large vertical range of manufacture.

39

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Nevertheless, the investment of capital in real assets is only
necessary to a relatively limited extent within the Group,
which is evident from the development of the capex ratio —
the ratio of total investments® in property, plant and equipment
to consolidated revenue. In financial year 2013/2014 this ratio
was 1.9%, as in the previous financial year.

At Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment are subject to scheduled,
straight-line amortization and depreciation, respectively, over
their estimated useful lives. Further details on this can be
found in note “(2) (f) Other intangible assets” and “(2) (g)

Net assets

Presentation of net assets

Total assets increased to € 1,039.1 million as of 30 September

2014 (30 September 2013: € 983.1 million). This increase

is mainly attributable to the acquisition of Aaren Scientific Inc.

and Optronik A.S.

A.S. and Aaren Scientific Inc. Current trade receivables also
decreased as of the end of the reporting period, from

€ 150.0 million as of 30 September 2013, to € 142.6 million
as of 30 September 2014. Inventories increased to

€ 172.4 million as of 30 September 2014 (30 September 2013
€ 148.5 million), due, among other things, to the stockpiling
of inventories in the course of several product launches at

NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Employees

Highly qualified and motivated employees are a necessity for
assuring the long-term success of a company. Responsible
human resources development and continuous improvement
play a crucial role in this. As of 30 September 2014 the

Carl Zeiss Meditec Group had 2,972 employees worldwide
(previous year 2,540). The year-on-year increase in the
number of employees is mainly due to the acquisitions of
Aaren Scientific Inc. and Optronik A.S.

year 26.5%), respectively, the majority of employees were
working in “Production” or “Sales and Marketing” as of

30 September 2014. The increase in “Production” is primarily
attributable to the acquisition of Aaren Scientific Inc. A total
of 16.3% (previous year 18.8%) were working in “Service”.
The percentage of employees working in “Research and
Development” amounted to 14.7 % as of the end of the

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

on the personal and professional development of employees
in the Group. The Company considers this a sound basis for
ensuring long-term economic success. The Company aims to
increase its attractiveness as an employer through strategic
employee development.

Production

Production plants

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group manufactures its products in
Jena, Oberkochen and Berlin in Germany, Dublin and Ontario
in the USA and in La Rochelle in France. The Group also has a
number of smaller sites belonging to subsidiaries of Carl Zeiss
Meditec S.A.S. in Besancon (France), Livingston (Scotland)
and Mauritius. Systems and devices for ophthalmology are
manufactured by the Company in Dublin and in Jena. The
Group manufactures surgical microscopes and microsurgical
visualization solutions in Oberkochen; intraocular lenses are
mainly manufactured in La Rochelle and Berlin, and Ontario.
The broad product portfolio is rounded off by viscoelastics,
which are produced at the facility in Livingston and are mainly
used for treating cataracts. The two remaining production
facilities of Carl Zeiss Meditec S.A.S. manufacture instruments
and consumables for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases.

Production concept

When manufacturing its devices and systems, the Carl

Zeiss Meditec Group focuses on the assembly of system
components, most of which it purchases from external
suppliers. The vertical range of manufacture for intraocular
lenses (IOLs) is higher, however. Production of these largely
takes place in-house at the Company. Only a number

of specific steps in the production process are outsourced

to external companies. When selecting suppliers, the Carl
Zeiss Meditec Group continuously strives to qualify additional
suppliers for key components and vendor parts, as appropriate,
in order to reduce its dependence on individual suppliers.

The main focus concerning production processes is to be able
to respond quickly to customer enquiries and requirements, to
implement short chains of command and to be able to quickly
and efficiently carry innovations over into production. Shorter
throughput times play a major role in this, as well as reducing
inventories, while simultaneously optimizing production costs,
and improving product quality.

44

Production planning

Production planning in Jena, Oberkochen and Dublin is based
on the rolling forecast method. The majority of distribution
partners prepare a sales forecast once a quarter for the

next 15 months. The sales forecast is then translated into

a demand forecast for production units, taking inventory
changes into account. In order to keep stocks to a minimum,
products are usually assembled to customer order (series
production of individual items). The rolling forecast method
described above is also applied for the manufacture of
intraocular lenses. Limited quantities of the finished products
are stockpiled, however, since customers expect very short
delivery times for implants. To this end replenishment orders
are forwarded by the customers to a central warehouse;
these, in turn, trigger a new order thus ensuring customers
are served as quickly as possible. The Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group also operates consignment warehouses in clinics

and hospitals, which — depending on consumption — are
continuously restocked

Research and development

Objectives and focus of research and development
Research and development (R&D) plays an important role
within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. Pursuant to its strategy,
innovations are a key driver of future growth. The Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group has the necessary resources to secure the
Company's future earnings strength with its research and
development activities. The Company shall therefore continue
to offer innovations in future that make leading technologies
available to its customers, enable improvements in efficiency
and continuously enhance treatment results for patients.

For this reason the Company is aiming to expand its product
portfolio and continuously improve products that are already
on the market. Our main priority here shall be to increase
the efficiency and effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment.
The Company attaches great importance to the needs of its
customers and continuously works closely with them.

In financial year 2013/2014 research and development
expenses increased by 2.2% to € 99.8 million (previous year
€ 97.6 million). At the same time the R&D ratio remained
almost the same as the previous year, at 11.0% (previous
year 10.8%).

In the reporting period 14.7 % (previous year 16.2 %) of
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's entire workforce worked in
Research and Development.

Focus of research and development activities in the
reporting period

Research and development at the Company mainly focuses on:

» examining new technological concepts in terms of their
clinical relevance and effectiveness

» the continuous development of the existing product
portfolio

» the development of new products and product platforms
based on the available basic technologies and

» networking systems and equipment to increase the
efficiency of diagnosis and treatment and to improve
treatment results for patients.

Once again, therefore, a number of innovations were
launched on the market during the reporting period.

Essential Line

With the Essential Line the Group offers its customers a
broader diagnostics portfolio for basic ophthalmic diagnostics.
In addition to the tried-and-tested slit lamps with imaging
functions, this range also includes products for measuring
objective refraction (VISUREF® 100, VISULENS® 500 and
i.Profiler®°"’), as well as an applanation tonometer and the
previously mentioned non-contact tonometer VISUPLAN® 500.
New to the range are the digital phoropter VISUPHOR® 500
and the VISUSCREEN 100/500 Acuity Charts, which are used
to measure subjective refraction. Immediately available

for examining the retina is the portable fundus camera,
VISUSCOUT® 100. With this comprehensive range of
products, the Essential Line helps customers to achieve the
best measurement results and improve the efficiency of their
workflows. Ophthalmologists and optometrists can start off
with individual pieces of equipment and gradually add more

® Optical coherence tomography

devices to build a complete workstation. The Essential Line
devices can be combined with each other, and with other
devices already available in the practice, via established
practice management systems (Electronic Medical Record,
EMR), for smooth workflows.

1OLMaster® 700

The IOLMaster® 700 with SWEPT Source Biometry™ enables
physicians to identify irregular geometries of the eye in their
patients at an early stage. In addition to optical biometry,

it also offers OCT? imaging across the entire length of the
eye. Experts say that this produces more reliable refractive
results. Up until now, even a flawless operation and a high-
quality lens could bring unsatisfactory results, if irregular

eye geometries were overlooked. The device simplifies the
workflow: like the |OLMaster® 500, it takes a reference image
of the limbal blood vessels, which allows the cylinder axis to
be displayed intraoperatively in the surgical microscope as a
navigational aid for the surgeon. As a component of the ZEISS
Cataract Suite markerless, the |OLMaster® 700 also helps to
improve efficiency in the implantation of toric lenses.

VISUPLAN® 500

The Company has provided ophthalmologists and opticians
with another way to optimize workflows with the launch
of the non-contact tonometer, VISUPLAN® 500. This device
works with a small puff of air and enables physicians to
examine their patients without the use of anesthetic or
fluorescent dye. The technology is used to detect increased
intraocular pressure in patients, and thus the associated
risk of contracting glaucoma, at an early stage of the
examination process. Another advantage for the physician
is that measurements can be routinely carried out at the
practice very early on by practice or clinical staff, as part

of preliminary assessments. The VISUPLAN® 500 makes it easy
to delegate measurement, as the measurement results are
user-independent.

MEL® 90 Excimer Laser

The MEL® 90 is a new and improved excimer laser for laser
vision correction. It enables a reduction in ablation depth and
shortens treatment times, while also ensuring even greater
reproducibility. The MEL® 90 guarantees gentle correction and
excellent predictability, even in patients with very high or very
low ametropia. The shorter treatment time increases comfort
for both the patient and the surgeon.

ZEISS Cataract Suite markerless

The ZEISS Cataract Suite markerless enables a comprehensive,
end-to-end workflow for cataract surgery with astigmatism
correction, with all components working together in perfect
harmony. It incorporates components such as the ZEISS
lOLMaster® 500 for quick and fully networked reference
images of the eye, the comprehensive data management
system FORUM®, the OR assistance system CALLISTO eye®,
and the OPMI LUMERA® 700 surgical microscope. Surgeons can
therefore devote their full attention to the surgical procedure and
patients benefit from a more comfortable treatment.

VISALIS® 500 with APM™ mode

The phaco emulsification device VISALIS® 500, with its new
ultrasound modulation APM™ (Advanced Power Modulation)
features a significant reduction in phaco energy and increased
anterior chamber stability. The aim of this is better treatment
outcomes and faster recovery of the eye after surgery, as well
as a significantly shorter treatment time.

AT LISA® tri toric 939MP

The Company expanded its offering of premium intraocular
lenses at the beginning of financial year 2013/2014 with the
toric trifocal intraocular lens. The AT LISA® tri toric 939MP is
the first preloaded trifocal toric intraocular lens on the market.
Following the extremely successful launch of the AT LISA® tri
839MP last year, ophthalmologists can now also give cataract
patients with astigmatism an almost natural visual experience
without glasses in the near, distance and intermediate vision
range. Based on the LISA concept and its product platform,
the AT LISA® tri toric also offers very good light transmission,
as well as an innovative enhancement of asymmetric light
distribution: for the patient this means very good vision, even
in difficult light conditions, the preservation of contrast
sensitivity and the reduction of halos and undesirable glare
effects, which is particularly important at night.

CT LUCIA®

The Company already offers an extensive range of hydrophilic
intraocular lenses, which are suitable for microincision
cataract surgery with a large diopter range. With the launch

46

of the hydrophobic monofocal intraocular lens CT LUCIA®,
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group now offers one of the most
comprehensive IOL portfolios on the market, thus giving
cataract surgeons more choices. The C-loop design of the
CT LUCIA® is based on “glistening-free”, hydrophobic
biomaterial and has aberration-correcting, aspheric ZEISS
optics. A fully preloaded injector system ensures ease of

use and trouble-free unfolding of the intraocular lens. It also
offers surgeons an efficient workflow during surgery and it
gives patients optimum visual results, due to the optical design

OPMI LUMERA® and Rescan™ 700

This system for integrated intraoperative OCT imaging
combines two of the Company's gold standard technologies.
The system incorporates the OPMI LUMERA® 700 surgical
microscope with the integrated OCT camera RESCAN™ 700.
The system provides surgeons with top-quality OCT images

of the eye, intraoperatively. The OCT images are superimposed
over the microscope image in the eyepiece as three-dimensional
real-time images, thus giving a view of anatomical details
below the surface and making it possible to identify even
transparent structures of the anterior and posterior segments
of the eye. This means that OCT information, which could
previously only be generated pre-operatively, is now available
online during surgery for the first time. Continuous OCT
scanning also helps to improve the treatment results, as the
surgeon can monitor progress and can review the outcome
during the operation. The new device thus provides a better
foundation for making decisions during surgery.

EyeMag® Light II

The EyeMag® Light II, a combination of medical head loupe
and light, brings improvements in everyday dental and
surgical practice. It provides a homogeneously illuminated
field of treatment, with light that is similar to daylight, is very
comfortable to wear and has a long battery life. In addition,
it can be quickly adjusted to the physician's current treatment
position and thus enables a comfortable and ergonomic
seating position.

Brands and patents

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group currently owns more than

800 patent families worldwide. Patent protection varies from
country to country. However, the Company strives to protect
products in its various markets as comprehensively as possible
with patents. The Company therefore invests in innovations
and solutions and ensures that these products have an
innovative edge through patents. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
is granted an average of one patent a week. Since a number
of products have already been on the market for some time,


--- Page 20 ---

patent protection does not extend to the basic functionality
of these products, but, rather, to individual features and
enhancements that protect beneficial solutions. As a result,
the Group is able to successfully and permanently maintain
its position in the market.

In addition, the Company has more than 650 registered
brands and brand registrations (as of 30 September 2014)
These include, among others, product names, slogans,
images, logos and other specific characteristics of the Company.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration of the Management Board

The members of the Management Board are remunerated
based on Section 87 German Stock Corporation Act
(Aktiengesetz). According to this, the Supervisory Board
determines the remuneration, which comprises fixed and
variable components, and payments in kind. The Supervisory
Board's General Committee proposes the amount and
structure of the remuneration to be paid to the Management
Board, and these are then approved by the Supervisory
Board as a whole. The appropriateness of the Management
Board remuneration is based on the duties and the personal
contribution of the individual members of the Management
Board, as well as the Company's overall financial position and
market environment.

At its meeting on 27 November 2013, the Supervisory Board
addressed the objectives to be set for the Management
Board for financial year 2013/2014 and the achievement

of the objectives of the Management Board members for
financial year 2012/2013, and stipulated the relevant variable
remunerations. The salaries of the Management Board were
also reviewed during the meeting on 27 November 2013

— based on the salary situation compared with the market,
the general price and salary trends and the achievements
demonstrated and achievements anticipated in future — and
adjusted with effect from 1 October 2013.

Mr. Thomas Simmerer's contract was also extended during
the Supervisory Board meeting on 27 November 2013, until
30 September 2018.

In addition to his function as President and CEO of Carl
Zeiss Meditec AG, Dr. Ludwin Monz was also appointed as a
member of the Group Management Board of Carl Zeiss AG,

effective from 1 January 2014. At its meeting on 10 December
2013 the Supervisory Board approved the appointment of

Dr. Monz as a member of the Group Management Board Carl
Zeiss AG

At its meeting on 26 September 2014 the Supervisory Board
addressed the Management Board objectives for financial
year 2014/2015. At the same meeting on 26 September 2014
the Supervisory Board redefined the amount and structure

of the remuneration and other conditions of employment

for Dr. Monz as Chairman of the Management Board of Carl
Zeiss Meditec AG, further to his appointment as a member of
the Group Management Board of Carl Zeiss AG, with effect
from 1 January 2014. The remuneration paid to Management
Board members Dr. Christian Muller and Thomas Simmerer
was reviewed and adjusted, effective 1 October 2014, based
on the salary situation compared with the market, the general
price and salary trends, as well as achievements demonstrated
and achievements anticipated in future.

Structure and amount of remuneration paid to the
Management Board

The remuneration paid to the Management Board of Carl
Zeiss Meditec AG consists of a fixed and a variable portion.
The variable portion is split into two components: the first
component is contingent upon the achievement of certain
targets for the respective current financial year and the second
bears a long-term incentive effect.

The fixed portion of the remuneration paid to the
Management Board is not contingent upon the achievement
of certain targets. It is paid monthly.

The variable portion of the remuneration, which relates

to targets set for the respective financial year, is contingent
upon the achievement of certain quantitative and qualitative
targets. The quantitative objectives mainly relate to Economic
Value Added? (“EVA®”) and free cash flow. Certain strategic
targets agreed individually with the members of the
Management Board are also taken into consideration. This
portion of the remuneration is paid after the end of the
respective financial year. The amount is contingent upon the
degree of target fulfillment

In addition to the two components of Management Board
remuneration described above, there is also a so-called Long
Term Incentive Program (“LTI"), which was redesigned and
published in financial year 2011.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT


--- Page 21 ---

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

This program offers a remuneration component with a
long-term incentive, which allows the members of the
Management Board to achieve an additional annual income
after a three-year period. This amounts to 50% of the
individual short-term variable remuneration for the financial
year that precedes the beginning of the term of an LT!
tranche, plus interest. This is based on the Carl Zeiss Group’s
profit-participation certificate model. A precondition for
payment of this remuneration is that the members of the
Management Board have not handed in their notice at

the end of the applicable three-year period per tranche, and
the equity ratio of the Carl Zeiss Group is higher than 20% at
this point. The first payment shall be made in December 2014.

from the annual appropriation to the pension provision for

Dr. Monz’s function as President and CEO of Carl Zeiss Meditec
AG shall from now on be passed on to Carl Zeiss Meditec AG.

Projected unit credits for pensions for other former members
of the Management Board of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG amounted
to € 691.3 thousand (previous year € 560.5 thousand).

Departure of members of the Management Board

In the event of premature termination of the employment
relationship, the contracts for members of the Management
Board do not contain any explicit promise of a severance
payment. A severance payment may, however, ensue from
a severance agreement concluded on an individual basis.

Remuneration of the Supervisory Board

The Annual General Meeting on 4 March 2014 resolved an
amendment to Art. 19 of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's Articles of
Association that affects the remuneration of the members of
the Supervisory Board. The revised version of the Articles of
Association remedies a previous deviation from Section 5.4.6
of the German Corporate Governance Code, providing for

a restriction of the remuneration of the Supervisory Board

to a fixed amount, and became effective with entry in the
commercial register on 20 May 2014. Therefore, in financial
year 2013/2014 the previous regulation was applied up until
20 May 2014, followed by the new regulation from that
point.

The previous regulation provided that the remuneration of
the Supervisory Board would include, in addition to a basic
remuneration and remuneration for work on the committees,
a variable component that takes appropriate account of

the Company’s earnings per share. The basic remuneration
for each member of the Supervisory Board was € 20,000.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board received double

this amount and the Deputy Chairman received one-and-a-
half times this amount. With the exception of members of
the Nominating Committee and the Chairman and Deputy
Chairman of the General Committee, members of committees
received an additional, fixed remuneration of € 5,000;

the Chairman of the Audit Committee received double

this amount.

2 Member of the Supervisory Board from 20 August 2007 until 4 March 2014.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

FINA

The variable component was structured such that if
consolidated earnings per share amounted to at least

€ 0.20, a total amount of € 1,000.00 shall be calculated

for each full € 0.02 consolidated earnings per share above

€ 0.20 consolidated earnings per no-par value share for

the respective financial year just ended, multiplied by the
number of members of the Supervisory Board. From this total
amount, each member was entitled to a portion equivalent
to his/her share of the annual remuneration of all members —
consisting of basic and committee remuneration. The variable
component paid was limited to the annual fixed remuneration
(sum of basic and committee remuneration).

The new regulation stipulates that the remuneration of

the Supervisory Board shall be composed exclusively of a
fixed basic remuneration and remuneration for work on

the committees. The basic remuneration for each member

of the Supervisory Board amounts to € 30,000. The Chairman
of the Supervisory Board shall receive double this amount; the
Deputy Chairman and the Chairman of the Audit Committee
shall receive one-and-a-half times this amount. With the
exception of the members of the Nominating Committee

and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the General
Committee, members of committees receive an additional,
fixed remuneration of € 5,000.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

The Company did not pay the members of the Supervisory
Board any additional remunerations or benefits for personally
rendered services (specifically consultancy and agency services)
in financial year 2013/2014.

Directors & Officers (D&O) liability insurance has been taken
out for the members of the Supervisory Board of Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG, which provides for an excess that is also specified
in the Company's Articles of Association. This corresponds

to at least 10% of the damage up to at least one-and-a-half
times the fixed annual remuneration.

OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT
Opportunity and risk management

The term “risk” refers to all circumstances and developments
within and outside the Company which could cause an
adverse deviation, within the scope of a prescribed period

of assessment, from the fulfilment of business objectives,
strategies and forecasts. Conversely, opportunities are positive
deviations in relation to these targets.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is naturally exposed to a large
number of risks within the scope of its business dealings.
Regulating and controlling these risks within the bounds of
risk-taking is a basic requirement for the Company's success.
An effective risk management system implemented for this
purpose serves to sustainably protect and — with respect to
the associated opportunities — increase corporate value. A
key objective is to prevent the occurrence of potential risks in
advance, or, in the case of risks that have already arisen, to
minimize their adverse effects by taking appropriate measures

The risk management system of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
exclusively records risks and incorporates all fully consolidated
subsidiaries, and is essentially decentralized, i.e., the legally
independent entities are responsible for their own local risk
management. At Group level the same principles apply for the
Group functions. Risks are communicated along the legal and
organizational structure. The provision of a standard, group-
wide conceptional framework and the coordination of the
local entities with respect to the risk management process is
incumbent upon the Group risk manager, who reports directly
to the Management Board.

50

Risk management is an integral part of corporate
management within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group, and
is based on the following two major components: a risk
reporting system and an internal control system.

Risk reporting system

This is a clearly structured, traceable feedback loop which
encompasses all of the Company’s activities, is integrated

in its organizational structure and its control and reporting
processes, and comprises a systematic and ongoing process
for the identification, assessment, regulation/control, as well
as the documentation and communication of any risks. This
enables any relevant information to be immediately passed on
to the responsible decision makers. The main features of this
system are as follows:

» The coordinated implementation of measures by the risk
reporting system is ensured through the compilation of all
relevant facts in the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's corporate
policy on risk management. Under the direction of a central
Group risk manager, the local risk managers, together with
local management at the individual locations, regularly assess
processes, transactions and developments for existing risks.

» Risks are identified and evaluated according to standard risk
matrices

» An early-warning system assesses business risks according to
their potential implications over the period of their existence.
The period of assessment is a maximum of five years. The
risks are recorded in a database-assisted software solution
and rated and categorized according to their probability of
occurrence and damage potential.

Regular risk reports are sent to the Management Board,

the Managing Directors of the subsidiaries and the other
decision-makers within the Company on the basis of specified
thresholds for relevant risks and in accordance with the
classification using the risk matrices. Significant risks arising
at very short notice are reported to this responsible group
immediately.

On this basis, appropriate steps are taken to avoid identified
risks or reduce the probability of their occurrence, and

to minimize the potential financial losses. The effect of
these measures is quantified to analyze to what extent the
respective risk in question can be reduced or whether it is
possible to prevent it entirely. The measures to reduce risks
and the early warning indicators are regularly updated, just
like the residual risks derived from these, and documented in
the above-mentioned database-assisted software.


--- Page 24 ---

The risk reporting system is continuously reviewed and further
developed, and is also audited by the auditor for Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG.

Internal control system (ICS)

The internal control system is the set of all control measures
prescribed by management that serve to control the
systematic, enduring risks and thus ensure proper running

of operations and correct management reporting. These
organizational measures are integrated in operative business
processes and mainly include an appropriate separation of
functions, application of the dual control principle, and access
and approval regulations. The internal control system works to
support the achievement of business policy objectives through
effective and efficient management, compliance with laws and
legal requirements (compliance), protection of the Company's
assets, assurance of the reliability and completeness of
internal and external accounting and timely and reliable
financial reporting. The operative function of the internal
control system is closely linked to the risk reporting system.

The structure of the internal control system of the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group is based on the component dimension of the
internationally recognized COSO (Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk
Management Framework. The result forms a complete,
Group-wide, risk-based ICS description, which is maintained
within the scope of the quarterly risk reporting cycles.
Information about the function of the internal control system,
the regulation of responsibilities and general instructions are
compiled in the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's corporate policy
on risk management.

The accounting-related part of the internal control system
is a system structured within the sphere of responsibility of
and under the supervision of the CFO, which ensures that the
preparation of the consolidated annual financial statements
is in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs), and that external financial reporting is reliable

The operative, timely implementation of the systemic
requirements is effected by the affected areas of Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG and its subsidiaries. These are supported

and monitored by Carl Zeiss Meditec's Finance Group
department. The Finance Group department is responsible

MANAGEMENT REPORT

FINA

for consolidated reporting, including Group-wide financial
and management information, forecasts, budgets and risk
reporting. Acts of law, accounting standards and other
pronouncements are continuously analyzed with regard to
their relevance for and impact on the consolidated and annual
financial statements. Relevant requirements are communicated
in consolidated accounting guidelines and, together

with the applicable Group-wide financial reporting calendar,
form the basis for the financial statement preparation

process. In addition, supplementary instructions for methods,
standardized reporting formats, IT systems and IT-supported
reporting and consolidation processes support the process for
uniform and proper consolidated accounting.

Assessment of the internal control system

The internal control system is regularly assessed and further
developed with respect to the efficacy of compliance with
external requirements and the containment of organizational
risks.

The internal control system can only provide reasonable

but not absolute assurance that the relevant targets will

be achieved. Measures implemented may therefore only

aim to control the known or potential systematic sources
of error. Another matter to consider when setting up an

internal control system is cost effectiveness.

Evidence of the effectiveness of the internal control system

is seen from the results of the measures specifically set up to
assess the effectiveness of the internal control system or from
observing processes anchored in normal business operations
Information from other sources is also a key component of
management assessment, as this can show up management
shortcomings or confirm the effectiveness of the established
measures. Such sources include reports from Group Auditing
at Carl Zeiss AG, reports on audits conducted by or on behalf
of supervisory authorities, reports prepared by external
auditors, as well as reports commissioned to assess the
efficiency of processes outsourced to third parties.

The effectiveness of the internal control system is reviewed
by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Carl
Zeiss Meditec AG. Monitoring in this respect is based on an
adequate level of information.

51

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT


--- Page 25 ---

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

The assessment performed by the Management Board,

which includes the information from all the above-mentioned
sources, led to the conclusion that the internal control system
is appropriately structured, effectively implemented and
efficient in terms of the correctness of the accounting process
and compliance.

Significant risks

The individual risks identified by the risk management system
are detailed below. Quantitative data is based on a net
perspective after application of measures, and relates to the
risk assessment period. The section entitled “Risk reporting
system” contains further information on the quantification
method used.

Economic environment

As a company with global operations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group is particularly exposed to developments that pose a
risk for the global economy. Therefore, the general global
political situation, major natural disasters, macroeconomic
development and market trends in individual regions of the
world may have diverse effects on the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group's chances of success in all business segments.

In particular the underlying conditions in the global economy
have become more volatile over the past few years, which
has heightened economic risks overall. Economic growth may
be curbed significantly by the euro crisis, the debt situation
in the USA and a slowdown in growth in China. Such a
trend in the overall economic situation may have an adverse
effect on the economic situation of our customers and their
demand for Carl Zeiss Meditec’s products. This could lead,

at least temporarily, to demand shortfalls and thus negative
consequences for sales and earnings. Thanks to the early-
warning system established within the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group, these risks are recognized in good time and can be
countered accordingly. In addition, the Group's international
presence means it is less affected by regional crises, and

the highly differentiated product and customer structure

of the Company limits its sales risks. According to current
assessments, the Company is not exposed to any significant
risks.

Market and competition

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to intense
competitive pressure in its search for new diagnostic and
treatment methods, particularly in its “Ophthalmic Systems”
and “Surgical Ophthalmology” SBUs. New competitors
may enter the market. There is also a risk, in the event of

52

significant exchange rate fluctuations, that competitors from
the beneficiary countries may be able to offer considerably
lower prices in the market, and could therefore improve their
competitive position. Some competitors are larger than the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group in terms of their total revenue and
have greater financial resources at their disposal to deal with
this competitive pressure. Furthermore, existing competitors
may be bought up by large, financially strong companies,

or they may form alliances. The resulting or heightened
competitive pressure this would cause could lead to lower
selling prices, margin pressure and/or the loss of market
shares. The Company prepares itself for the potential risks of
a changing market environment by continuously observing
and analyzing the market, in order to be able to react with
the necessary foresight.

The costs of certain medical treatments carried out using
products of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group are reimbursed

by health insurance funds, insurance companies or government
health schemes. Changes in health and reimbursement policy
in Germany or abroad could lead to the denial or reduction of
reimbursement services. If reimbursement rates are too low,
the profit margin of doctors and hospitals may fall, prompting
them to suspend or restrict the performance of the respective
treatments. The complete or partial discontinuation of
reimbursements may accordingly reduce the demand

for Carl Zeiss Meditec’s products. In the case of new
products, for which it cannot be predicted with any certainty
whether health insurance funds, insurance companies or
government health schemes will offer any reimbursement

at all, or treatments with products for which there is no
reimbursement, e.g. laser treatments for vision correction,
demand may be significantly impaired by the financial
situation of consumers. These risks, as well as the issues
outlined below, may affect all segments of the Group

The appearance of press reports about the potential risks

of certain treatments, or changes in fashions and trends,

may also adversely affect consumer decisions. A decline in

the demand for such treatments may lead to a decrease in

the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group’s revenue, as physicians and
treatment centers may no longer purchase the same quantities
of such devices.

In addition, on the customer side, and particularly in the
private healthcare sector, there is a noticeable increase in the
formation of regional and national purchasing alliances, as
well as clinic chains. Such a trend may lead to falling selling
prices in this customer segment.


--- Page 26 ---

Collectively, the above issues may impact the Group's earnings
by an amount in the low double-digit million euro range.

On the other hand, the demographic trend in industrialized
countries and economic development in the RDEs, as well as
the increasing requirements placed on medical devices for
diagnosing and treating age-related eye diseases, present
growth opportunities for the Company.

New technologies and products

The markets in which the Company operates are characterized
by a constant stream of technological innovations. A
capacity for innovation and rapid product development are
key competitive factors. New scientific findings may lead

to shorter development and product cycles, alternative
technologies or new pharmaceutical procedures. The success
of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group therefore depends heavily
on the quick development of innovative and market-driven
products, and on the timely recognition and conversion of
new technology trends and new medical findings into new
products. Should the Group lose touch with technological
developments on the market, react too late to trends

or technological advancements, this could weaken its
competitive position. There is also a risk of one or several

of the Group’s products being completely superseded by
alternative technologies, pharmaceutical procedures or
treatment methods, thus reducing or entirely eliminating
demand for certain products, which could result in losses in
sales and earnings. The potential impact on earnings of these
risks equates to an amount in the mid-single-digit to the low
double-digit million euro range.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group actively counters this risk,
which affects all segments, by investing heavily in research
and development and upstream areas of the production

of products with a technological edge and unique selling
points. To this end, the management concerns itself with
detailed market and competition analyses, market scenarios,
the relevant cost drivers and critical success factors of the
Company.

Personnel risks

The Group's success also depends on its ability to

recruit and retain for the long term well qualified specialists
and managers for all functions in all regions. Employee
competence, commitment and motivation play a vital role
in determining the Company's success and the Group's
competitive chances in all business segments. When looking
for qualified employees, the Company has to compete with
many other companies in the same sector. Unfilled positions

MANAGEMENT REPORT

FINA

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

could limit the technological advancement and sale of the
products and services it offers. The Company counters this
risk through active employee development and successor
planning, and by maintaining and improving its attractiveness
as an employer. The management does not expect this to
have any material effects on the Group’s net assets, financial
position or results of operations.

Product approval and political environment

In many of the countries in which the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group operates there are special government regulations

that apply. As the Group aims to sell its products worldwide,
such regulations have to be taken into consideration when
manufacturing and launching products in the market,
especially where explicit regulatory approvals and certifications
are required.

Although the relevant legal requirements are incorporated
into all stages of development, production and distribution,
there is no guarantee that products requiring approval will
be granted regulatory approval at all or in time for their
planned launch in the market, or that the Group’s numerous
registrations will still exist or be renewed in the future. This
could lead to losses in sales. A delayed product launch may,
in certain circumstances, result in that product not being
accepted or meeting with only a small level of acceptance,
as competitors may have launched similar products in the
meantime. It is also possible for a sales ban to be imposed on
the products of the Company, or for the regulatory approval
requirements to be tightened in future.

In order to be able to identify such developments in good time
and react appropriately, the Group keeps a very close eye on
developments in this area and monitors approval procedures
extremely closely as part of its quality management system
Any residual risks that remain lie within the low to mid-single-
digit million euro range.

Dependence on affiliated companies and external
suppliers

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group and the Carl Zeiss Group have
close contractual relationships in some areas. This relates

in particular to the procurement of IT services, the licensed
use of the “ZEISS” brand and agreements with distribution
companies of the Carl Zeiss Group. This distribution network
provides major opportunities, which are rooted particularly
in the close-meshed coverage worldwide, a high level of
professional distribution expertise, and a more efficient market
development approach.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT


--- Page 27 ---

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

To a very large extent the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group uses
components from external suppliers to manufacture its
products in all business segments. This cooperation with
external suppliers is becoming progressively more intense,
due to general cost pressure and the complexity of the
components being supplied, which is leading to mutual
dependencies. Outsourcing contracts to third parties presents
the risk of non-delivery or delivery delays, as well as the
possibility of temporary shortages of specific goods and
vendor parts, if individual business or cooperation partners do
not duly fulfil their contractual obligations. Unforeseen price
increases or even a termination of business relationships could
also interfere with the course of business. Qualifying new
suppliers, which would be necessary in this case, could take

a long time. Furthermore, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group may
be liable vis-a-vis its own customers for breach of contractual
obligations by its business and cooperation partners. This
could have negative implications for the production, sales and
the quality of the Company's products.

Monitoring supplier risks plays a key role in the early-warning,
risk information and management system. The effect of this
on earnings is in the mid-single-digit to low double-digit
million euro range. In order to limit the risks of such supplier
shortages, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group selects its suppliers
carefully. By implementing consistent supply chain measures,
such as qualifying its suppliers, identifying secondary suppliers
and preparing a strategic inventory plan, the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group protects itself as best it can against supplier
dependencies and changes on the commodities market.

Patents and intellectual property

The competitiveness of the Company depends on the
protection of its technological innovations against exploitation
of these innovations by third parties. Violations of intellectual
property and patent protection may compromise the Company's
technological lead and thus its competitive advantage

in all business segments. In order to counter this risk, the
Group protects its own inventions with patents, acquires

or licenses patents from third parties and endeavors to
protect these patents and its other intellectual property. The
expiry of property rights, particularly patents, as well as the
geographical limitation of property rights could, however,
result in new or existing competitors exploiting the inventions

54

of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group to enter the market or
strengthen their market position.

Furthermore, in spite of the measures taken, third parties may
still attempt to copy or partly copy products of the Group,
since the unauthorized use of intellectual property is generally
difficult to monitor and copyright laws only provide for limited
protection. The Company may become involved in lengthy
and costly litigation proceedings in this respect. There is also
no guarantee that the measures taken by the Group to protect
its own intellectual property rights will successfully prevent the
development and design of products or technologies that are
either similar to or that could compete with the products of
the Company. If Carl Zeiss Meditec fails to ensure adequate
protection of its technological innovations, this could impair
the competitiveness of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group.

In order to avoid the above-mentioned litigation and prevent
the infringement of third-party patents by the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group, the Patents department analyzes patents
and new patent applications in the relevant areas at regular
intervals. Overall, management in the area of patents and
intellectual property does not expect such risks to have any
material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position
or results of operations.

Loss of confidential data

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group owns a large number of
business secrets. A set of measures serves to ensure that the
confidentiality of business secrets is effectively protected and
that there are no infringements. If business secrets of the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group leak to competitors, this may have
adverse effects on the Group’s competitive position. To limit
this risk, ethical rules of behavior were laid down in the Carl
Zeiss Group's “Code of conduct” and brought to the attention
of all employees

In the sphere of IT solutions the Group has established

a number of mechanisms to protect confidential data.
Conformance to and the effectiveness of these measures is
continuously monitored. The management does not expect
this to have any material effects on the Group's net assets,
financial position or results of operations.


--- Page 28 ---

Compliance and prevention of infringements

Asa listed medical technology company, the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group is subject, in the countries in which the
Group operates, to a large number of laws, regulations and
guidelines outside of the product approval procedure (see
section entitled “Product approval and political environment”).
In order to ensure correct compliance with all regulations,
these are regularly analyzed for any changes and internal
processes and guidelines are adjusted, if necessary, to address
existing regulations. Regular training measures are also in
place to familiarize the employees with internal guidelines
and make them aware of the negative effects breaches could
have. The management does not expect this to have any
material effects on the Group’s net assets, financial position
or results of operations.

Product liability risk

There is an inherent risk of malfunctions in some of the
medical technology devices, systems solutions and implants
manufactured by the Company causing injury or adverse
effects to patients. This may be due, among other things,

to components and raw materials purchased from external
suppliers not meeting the specified quality requirements.
These risks cannot be entirely excluded, even if the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group applies all reasonable quality control measures
and complies with all legal requirements. Although no
significant product liability claims have been brought against
the Company to date, no assurance can be given that the Carl
Zeiss Meditec Group will not be faced with such claims in

the future. This may lead, on the one hand, to considerable
legal costs, irrespective of whether a claim for damages
ultimately materializes. It could also damage the Group's
reputation in the long term.

The Company covers itself against potential product liability
claims by taking out product liability insurance. Risk liability
claims can be particularly high, especially in the USA, not to
mention the costly recall campaigns that may be required.
The possibility cannot be entirely excluded that the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group’s existing insurance coverage may not be
sufficient to cover potential claims

The potential impact these risks could have on earnings
equates to an amount in the low single-digit million euro
range

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Certified quality management: A vital part of early risk
detection is the Group’s certified quality management system
Clearly structured and documented quality management
processes ensure not only transparency, but are now a
prerequisite in most markets for obtaining regulatory
approval for medical devices. The quality assurance system
employed by the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group was certified

by DQS GmbH Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Zertifizierung von
Managementsystemen and complies with the U.S. standard
for “Good Manufacturing Practice” (“GMP”), 21 C.F.R.

part 820, Quality System Regulation.

Infrastructure risks

Uncontrollable environmental influences, such as natural
disasters or terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect

on the affected economy or beyond. The consequences of
such events, such as the loss of employees or an interruption
to business operations at the affected locations, may prevent
the Company from providing regular production, distribution
and other services in these regions and generating the
expected earnings. All business segments could be affected by
this. In addition, it could have material adverse effects on the
Company's customers domiciled in the affected region and on
their willingness to invest, as well as the local suppliers there
and their willingness to supply. As a result, the Company's
reputation, business activities, financial condition and results
of operations, and its cash flow, could become significantly
compromised.

The Group has taken a number of precautions to minimize
these effects. The headquarters, which house our main
research and development departments, and other central
corporate functions, are situated in Germany. This region is
not generally afflicted by severe natural disasters. A second
major production site is located in the Greater San Francisco
area in the USA. There is a greater risk of earthquakes in this
region. In order to minimize potential damage and enable

a concerted, effective reaction by corporate management,
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has set up a crisis management
system, and has also developed local and central plans for
maintaining the functionality of critical business processes
(business continuity plans). Although the described risks
may materialize, the Company does not expect them — due
to these measures and the organization of the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group — to have any material adverse effects on
the its business activities, financial condition and results of
operations, or on its cash flow.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Information technology plays a crucial role in the execution of
the Company’s business processes. Providing and exchanging
up-to-date, complete and correct information, and being able
to implement fully functional IT applications, are of central
importance for a global company like the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group. Functioning and adequately documented IT systems
are also a prerequisite for obtaining product approvals in
certain countries. Risks that, in the event of damage, could
result in an interruption of business processes due to IT
system failures or the loss or falsification of data, are therefore
identified and evaluated across the entire life cycle of the
applications and IT systems. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has
defined appropriate measures so that risks can be avoided and
potential losses can be limited

Acquisition of businesses

Potential risks associated with acquisitions are carefully and
systematically assessed in advance. In order to conclude
transactions successfully, a standard process for mergers &
acquisitions was established, which pays particular attention
to due diligence. Each transaction is systematically assessed
for impairment and synergy potential. The transparency that
this creates helps the Company to make more confident
decisions.

Pursuant to IFRS 3, the goodwill usually arising from the
acquisition of other companies is not subject to scheduled
amortization but, rather, is regularly examined for impairment.
This involves an impairment test pursuant to IAS 36. The

Carl Zeiss Meditec Group reviews its goodwill for impairment
at least once a year.

Due to acquisitions made in the past, the Carl Zeiss

Meditec Group reports goodwill totaling € 158.9 million

in its consolidated statement of financial position as of

30 September 2014, of which € 125.5 million is attributable
to the “Surgical Ophthalmology” business unit, € 30.9 million
to “Ophthalmic Systems” and € 2.4 million to “Microsurgery”.

The impairment tests carried out in the current financial
year did not give any indication of impairment of the
goodwill-bearing cash-generating unit (CGU). Based on the
development of business, the Group also anticipates positive
results from subsequent tests. For the future, however, the
possibility cannot be entirely ruled out that the net assets,
financial position and results of operations of individual or

56

all of the goodwill-bearing CGUs may deteriorate. In such

an event, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group may be forced to
recognize through profit or loss an impairment of the reported
goodwill in its consolidated financial statements.

In future, the Group may achieve further growth by acquiring
other companies, among other things. When looking for
suitable acquisition targets, the Company competes with
other market players. There is a risk that there may not be any
suitable companies for acquisition or that these cannot be
acquired at acceptable conditions. Acquisitions also bear the
additional entrepreneurial risk of the acquired company not
performing as well economically as expected in the market,
or of the sales and earnings targets being pursued with its
acquisition not being reached, or of intended synergy effects
with the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group not being achievable.

With regard to other companies that may be acquired in
future, there is a general risk that it may not be possible to
fully and successfully integrate these companies into the

Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. In such an event, this could have
adverse effects on the net assets, financial position and
results of operations of the Group. Further details on business
acquisitions concerning the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group can be
found in note “(3) Purchase and sale of business operations”
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In the management's view, acquisitions do not pose any
significant risks as of the end of the reporting period

Legal risks

Legal risks may arise due, among other things, to changes in
general legal conditions in the relevant markets and to legal
disputes with competitors, business associates or customers.

Within the scope of its business operations, the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group may be party to various litigation proceedings
or may become involved in such proceedings in future. These
could individually have a significant impact on the economic
position of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. It is not possible
to determine or predict the outcome of pending or
threatened proceedings. Involvement in any litigation could
lead to considerable costs for the Company, irrespective of
the outcome. At the present time, there is no pending
litigation that poses a substantial risk. Should it be necessary,
adequate provisions will be set up as a precaution.


--- Page 30 ---

Further details on litigation and arbitration proceedings
involving the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group can be found in note
“(28) Contingent liabilities and other financial commitments”
in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

Financial risks

As a result of the European debt crisis there is a latent credit
quality risk concerning business banks at which the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group holds deposits. These risks have been reduced
by the package of measures adopted by the EU to stabilize the
capital markets and the affected countries. Nonetheless, the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has taken a number of additional
measures to limit these risks. One of these measures was to
introduce a monitoring procedure to monitor the current
situation on the capital markets.

The financial risks also include liquidity risks, price fluctuation
risks for financial instruments and risks associated with
fluctuations in cash flows. These risks and their management
are adequately described in note “(35) Financial risk
management”.

In spite of the enduring euro and debt crisis, the Company
has categorized the financial risks it faces as minor. The basis
for this categorization is the sound financing structure with
an equity ratio of 72.6%, the large reserve of cash and cash
equivalents, and a strong cash flow from operating activities.

Cash and cash equivalents are kept in reserve at the Carl

Zeiss Meditec Group based on a rolling monthly cash forecast
within a fixed planning period, and are managed as part of

a Group-wide Carl Zeiss cash pool. The Company does not
therefore anticipate any material adverse effect on its financial
result.

Risks relating to the Group accounting process

The main risks in the accounting process are that the financial
statements may not provide a true and fair view of the financial
position and results of operations as a result of unintentional
errors or willful actions, or that there is a delay in publishing
these. The accounting would not present a true and fair

view of the Company in this case. Deviations are classified as
significant if they could individually or collectively influence
the economic decisions taken by the recipients of the financial
statements based on the financial statements.

The accounting process integrates internal controls that have
been defined under risk aspects. These aim to minimize the risk

MANAGEMENT REPORT

FINA

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

of errors in the financial statements. The accounting-related
ICS incorporates both preventative and disclosure controls.

With regard to consolidated accounting, workflows with
integrated controls ensure that the consolidated financial
statements are complete and correct. These processes

to organize and execute the consolidation work and to
create the consolidated financial statements, as well as the
associated controls, have been documented and are reviewed
regularly. All of the Group’s internal accounting and valuation
guidelines are collated in an accounting manual, which is
available to all of the relevant organizational units and all

of the Company's employees via the Group’s intranet.

Additional disclosures pursuant to Section 289 (2)

No. 2 HGB, Section 315 (2) No. 2 HGB

Price fluctuation risks can generally not be ruled out. However,
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group counters these risks by focusing
on product innovations and optimizing its production costs
through cost-cutting and efficiency-enhancing measures.

Potential risks of default on trade receivables — particularly
given the euro and debt crisis and the generally greater risk of
bad debt losses that comes with it — are minimized by means
of an active credit control system. The Group also regularly
sets up adequate provisions to cover such risks. On the whole,
however, we consider this to be a limited risk. The ratio of
valuation allowances on trade receivables to consolidated
revenue was 0.6 % in the year under review, the same as in
the previous year.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group’s financial situation can be
considered stable. Cash and cash equivalents amounted

to € 10.7 million at the end of the reporting period on

30 September 2014. We also had credit balances, recognized
as receivables from the Group treasury of Carl Zeiss AG, of

€ 290.6 million. The Group also generated cash flow from
operating activities of € 63.1 million in the reporting period.
At the current time, therefore, there are no liquidity risks.

All cash and cash equivalents, including the balances via the
Group treasury of Carl Zeiss AG, are deposited at banks.
Should it come to a loss of individual banks — due in particular
to the euro and debt crisis — the balances existing there may
be endangered. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group counters this
risk by continuously monitoring the solvency of the banks with
which it has a business relationship, and by spreading its
assets among several banks via the Group treasury of Carl
Zeiss AG

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

As a company with global operations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group is exposed to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations.
In order to hedge against this currency risk, the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group concludes currency forward contracts based
on planned transactions in foreign currency. These contracts
generally span a period of up to one year. Based on current
exchange rate fluctuations, currency effects may continue to
curtail the financial result in the single-digit million range.

Overall statement on the Company's risk situation

There were no significant changes in the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group's risk situation during the reporting period compared
with the previous year. The assessment of the overall risk
situation is the result of a consolidated consideration of all
material individual risks. The Company exercises active and
efficient risk control in all areas of the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group to keep a general check on risks to the Group and
ensure that they are manageable.

From the current perspective there are no perceptible risks
which could — on their own or collectively — jeopardize the
future operations of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group.

DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO SECTION 289 (4)
AND SECTION 315 (4) HGB

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's subscribed capital amounts to

€ 81,309,610 and is composed of 81,309,610 no-par value
ordinary bearer shares (no-par value shares), each with a
theoretical interest in the share capital of € 1.00 per no-par
value share. Each share entitles the bearer to one voting
right and an equal share in Company profits.

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is aware of the following direct and
indirect holdings in the capital of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG

that exceed ten percent of the voting rights. Carl Zeiss AG,
Oberkochen, Germany, holds, both directly and indirectly,

a total of 65.05 % of the voting rights in Carl Zeiss Meditec
AG. This corresponds to 52,893,270 no-par value shares.
These include 7.47 % of the voting rights or 6,074,256 no-par
value shares in Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, which Carl Zeiss AG
holds indirectly via its wholly owned subsidiary Carl Zeiss Inc.,
Thornwood, USA.

Employees of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG or its affiliated companies
pursuant to Section 15 et seqq. AktG, who participated

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's share capital in previous years via
employee share plans, exercise their control rights directly like
all other shareholders of the Company.

58

Pursuant to Section 179 and Section 133 AktG, an
amendment to the Articles of Association requires a resolution
by the General Meeting which, in turn, requires a simple
majority of the votes cast and a majority comprising at least
three quarters of the share capital represented at the time the
resolution is passed. The Articles of Association may specify

a different capital majority; in the case of an amendment to
the purpose of the Company, however, only a larger capital
majority may be specified. Art. 25 of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's
Articles of Association states that in cases for which the law
requires a majority of the share capital represented at the time of
resolution, a simple majority of the share capital represented
is sufficient, provided that a greater majority is not mandatory
by law. In accordance with Art. 28 of the Articles of
Association of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, the Supervisory Board

is authorized to resolve amendments to the Articles of
Association that only affect the version. This complies with
Section 179 (1) Sentence 2 AktG.

The legal provisions concerning the appointment and dismissal
of members of the Management Board are set forth in Section
84 and Section 85 AktG. In compliance with this, Art. 6 (2) of
the Articles of Association of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG stipulates
that the Supervisory Board shall be responsible for appointing
and dismissing the members of the Management Board.
Pursuant to statutory provisions, a member of the Management
Board may only be dismissed for compelling reasons.

Pursuant to Art. 4 (5) of the Articles of Association of Carl
Zeiss Meditec AG, the Company has an Authorized Capital.
Accordingly, the Management Board is authorized, subject to
the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share
capital, on one or several occasions in the period until 11 April
2016, by up to € 39,654,800.00. New no-par value bearer
shares may be issued against cash and/or contributions in kind
for this. The Management Board is authorized, subject to

the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the statutory
subscription right of shareholders in the following cases:

» to balance out fractional amounts,

» if the capital increase is effected against cash contributions
and the new shares, for which the subscription rights are
excluded, are equivalent to no more than 10% of the share
capital, neither on the date the increase becomes effective,
nor on the date this authorization is exercised, and the
issuing price of the new shares is not significantly lower than
the market price of shares of the same type and structure
already publicly quoted. Sales of own shares on the basis of
other authorizations pursuant to Section 186 (3) sentence
4 AktG must be taken into account in the restriction to 10%
of the share capital


--- Page 32 ---

» for capital increases against contributions in kind to grant
shares for the purpose of acquiring companies, parts thereof
or interests in a company.

The Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval
of the Supervisory Board, to specify the details of capital
increases from Authorized Capital

Based on the resolution of the General Meeting of Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG on 4 March 2010, the Management Board is
authorized to purchase treasury shares. This authorization

is valid until 3 March 2015. The shares may be purchased,
with the consent of the Supervisory Board:

» to offer them for purchase to employees of the Company
and the companies affiliated with the Company within the
meaning of Section 15 et seqq. German Stock Corporation
Act (AktG) — noting that the right of shareholders to subscribe
to treasury shares is excluded — or

» to use them within the scope of mergers with companies
or to purchase companies, parts of companies or shares
in companies — noting that the right of shareholders to
subscribe to treasury shares is also excluded in this case — or

» to recall them.

This authorization is limited to the acquisition of shares
equivalent to share capital of € 8,130,000.00 or less than
10% of the total existing share capital. The shares shall be
purchased at the stock exchange. The consideration paid by
the Company per share (excluding incidental purchase costs)
may not be more than 10% above or below the closing rate
of the shares in Xetra trading (or an equivalent successor
system to the Xetra trading system) at the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange on the previous day of trading. At no time may the
purchased shares, together with other own shares held by the
Company and ascribable to it pursuant to Section 71a et seqq.
AktG, exceed 10% of the share capital

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

No events of material significance for the Group’s net assets,
financial position and earnings occurred after the end of
financial year 2013/2014. The development of business at
the beginning of financial year 2014/2015 validates the
statements made in the following “Outlook”

MANAGEMENT REPORT

FINA

On 16 October 2014 Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and Abbott
Medical Optics Inc., Santa Ana, USA concluded an agreement
on a non-exclusive distribution collaboration in the field of
cataract surgery in the United States. Under the terms of

this agreement, Abbott Medical Optics Inc. shall offer and
distribute the products of the Carl Zeiss Medical Group that
have approval in the USA in the field of cataract surgery, as
anew, additional distribution channel, supplementary to the
direct ZEISS distribution channel, which shall continue to exist.
The extensive range of diagnostic and visualization systems
for cataract patients, lens extraction systems, and intraocular
lenses, gives physicians broad coverage from one supplier.

OUTLOOK
Corporate strategy

In financial year 2014/2015 we aim to achieve further
sustainable growth. The aim of our strategy is to improve the
diagnosis and treatment of diseases by further developing
our products. Our strategy therefore focuses on the success
factors innovation, integrated solutions for diagnostics and
therapy, and customer focus. Innovation, in particular, plays
a key role in this.

Innovation:

A key element of our growth strategy consists in making
cutting-edge technology in medical application accessible
to our customers. We are therefore striving to establish our
products as the new gold standards in medical diagnostics
and therapy.

Integrated solutions:

Due to the breadth of our product range, we offer our
customers, particularly those in the area of ophthalmology,
the opportunity to make their workflows more efficient, and
to achieve better clinical outcomes, by logically networking
devices and systems. A comprehensive system integration

via data management solutions and IT-assisted analysis functions
is essential for this. In the reporting year we invested
consistently in the expansion of our software range and offer
our customers new solutions, among other things, in
glaucoma care and the treatment of cataracts in patients
with astigmatism.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT


--- Page 33 ---

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Customer Focus:

A primary objective of our innovation strategy is to improve
the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Our customers value
our support and service in order to be able to satisfy the
ever-growing demands for treatment quality and efficiency.
Continuously expanding our global service business shall

thus be a key growth driver for us for the next few years.

We expect the share of consolidated revenue generated

by our Service business to increase further in financial year
2014/2015.

In addition, the organizational structure shall be adjusted

at the beginning of the financial year. The previous
organizational structure mainly summarized the locations of
strategic business units (SBUs). In order to better substantiate
our claim to be a solutions provider, the new organizational
structure shall be geared even more strongly to our customer
groups. Accordingly, the composition of the product portfolio
of the three strategic business units shall change at the
beginning of the new financial year. The “Microsurgery” SBU
shall no longer be responsible for surgical microscopes for
ophthalmology in future; instead, these shall be assigned

to the “Surgical Ophthalmology” SBU. The optical biometry
segment was previously assigned to the “Ophthalmic
Systems” strategic business unit. From the start of the new
financial year, biometry shall also be part of the “Surgical
Ophthalmology” SBU.

Future conditions for business development

Macroeconomic conditions

The forecast for financial year 2014/2015 is continued
moderate global economic growth with regional variations. In
the USA growing investment activity and increasing consumer
demand are driving growth. Continued dynamic growth is
also projected for the emerging economies — particularly in
Asia and Latin America — if at a slower rate than before in
some areas. The growth indicators for the global economy,
however, show very clear signs of a future slowdown of the
markets. In addition, political uncertainties, particularly in
Russia, the Ukraine and the Middle East, may have an adverse
effect on growth.

Future situation in the medical technology industry
The Company’s management anticipates further growth

in the medical technology market, as the main growth
drivers — such as the growing global population, the rising
number of older people, and the increasing proportion

of the global population with access to medical care — shall
remain unchanged

60

Furthermore, the greater requirements being placed on the
innovations in the medical technology sector play an important
role from an efficiency and cost perspective. Consequently, the
products and procedures of medical technology manufacturers
shall no longer measured based only on their effectiveness

and safety, but also on their cost-efficiency. Integrated system
solutions for simplified workflows at the customer are an
important distinguishing feature in our opinion.

Last but not least, the development of the global economy
influences the growth of the medical technology industry
inasmuch as private customers or public budgets postpone
their investment decisions until the future, or make them early.

At the present time the medical technology industry is
expected to grow in the coming years in the low to mid-
single-digit percentage range.

Future development in the strategic business units
of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group

Based on the underlying and persistent long-term growth
trends, and in spite of imponderable macroeconomic
conditions, the management of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG
assumes that there will be further revenue growth in

the next financial year that is at least on a par with the
expected market growth for this industry.

Strategic business unit “Ophthalmic Systems”

During the past financial year, revenue in the “Ophthalmic
Systems” SBU declined, due mainly to negative currency
effects. We anticipate renewed growth in 2014/2015. In
particular the leading products we already have on the market
for diagnosing and treating ophthalmic diseases shall help us
to achieve this growth, as well as the new innovations to be
launched in the course of the financial year. With our broad
product range it is our ambition to be able to provide our
customers with efficient solutions for a smooth workflow, with
the best possible benefit for the patient. System networking
and integrated data management are an important strategic
focus in this respect. Our comprehensive data management
system FORUM®, in particular, offers excellent solutions for
this. Another example is in the area of refractive lasers, where,
two years after its international market launch, the ReLEx®
SMILE procedure has established itself as the third generation
of laser vision correction. Compared with previous procedures,
ReLEx® SMILE stands out by being considerably less invasive
and offering very good predictability of correction. To date,
more than 130,000 eyes worldwide have been successfully
treated using this microinvasive method.


--- Page 34 ---

The year under review was characterized in the “Ophthalmic
Systems” SBU by growing competitive pressure, particularly for
diagnostic devices. This pressure is intensified by the fact that,
for example, Japanese competitors, benefiting from currency
trends, can offer their products in the market at low prices.
The competitive situation results, in particular, in a high cost
pressure, which the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has to counter.
Due to product innovations, however, the new products we
have launched in the market, and a good performance by
refractive lasers, we are looking forward to the new financial
year with cautious optimism, and are confident that we shall
grow at least to the same extent as the underlying market.
From a current perspective, and excluding currency effects,
this corresponds to growth in the low to mid-single-digit
percentage range.

The EBIT margin is currently expected to improve. However, it
is still anticipated that this will be below the Group average.

Strategic business unit “Surgical Ophthalmology”

The “Surgical Ophthalmology” SBU continued to grow
significantly in the past financial year and was strategically
reinforced by the acquisition of the U.S. intraocular lens
manufacturer Aaren Scientific Inc. in January 2014. We
expect this growth to continue in financial year 2014/2015.
To achieve this we need to exploit and exhaust any potential
that remains in the markets in which we operate and further
strengthen our market position through innovations. MICS
lenses, which are already well established in the market,

play a key role in this, as well as the injectors suitable for
implantation, and the successfully established VISALIS® 500
phaco system, which is capable of microincision surgery. The
Company's AT LISA® tri and AT LISA® tri toric, in combination
with the BLUEMIX*™ 180 injector, is the only preloaded
MICS-compliant trifocal intraocular lens on the market. The
CT LUCIA®, launched in September 2014, is the first
intraocular lens in the standard segment to be manufactured
at our new site in Ontario. Excluding currency effects, we
are confident that we will once again grow faster than the
underlying market in 2014/2015, which is currently expected
to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range. As things
stand, the EBIT margin is expected to remain around the
average for the Group.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

FINA

Strategic business unit “Microsurgery”

In the past financial year revenue reached almost the same
figure as the previous year in the reporting currency. Adjusted
for currency effects, the “Microsurgery” SBU achieved a slight
increase and thus further improved our already exceptionally
strong market position. We expect this growth to continue

in 2014/2015. With our surgical microscopes the OPMI®
Pentero® for neuro, spinal or plastic surgery, or the OPMI®
VARIO, which is used in ENT surgery, for example, we are
broadly diversified and are exploiting the associated market
opportunities to an even greater degree by upgrading the
products in terms of additional supporting applications.

We expect the “Microsurgery” SBU to continue to make
significant contributions to earnings in future. We are
confident that we shall grow at least to the same extent as
the underlying market in the coming financial year. From

a current perspective, and excluding currency effects, this
corresponds to growth that is at most in the mid-single-
digit percentage range. As things stand, the EBIT margin

is expected to remain above the Group average.

Future selling markets

As a global Group, our continued aim in the years ahead
shall be to maintain as balanced a distribution of revenue as
possible across our individual markets. The Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group currently generates around one third of its revenue

in all three of its strategically important business regions:
“EMEA”, the “Americas” and “Asia/Pacific”. We see particularly
promising business prospects in the “Asia/Pacific” region.
These prospects shall become even more important in the
medium to long term, due to the rapid economic growth in
the “Asia/Pacific” region. Carl Zeiss AG's research centers in
India and China, which the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group uses

for product development, shall help to expand and ensure
this growth. These centers help us to work closely together
with our customers on site and thus to gear our activities,

in respect of the marketing, development, procurement and
production of our products, to the market conditions specific
to the region, and to the prevailing needs of customers
there. Another promising market, which we consider to hold
significant market potential for our products, is Latin America.
We aim to exploit the potential in these countries to an even
greater extent in future and generate further revenue growth.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Future research and development activities

We aim to continue to be a pioneer of innovative solutions
and processes, and to continuously develop our expertise in
this area. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group continues to invest
considerable funds in research and development projects.
Efficient and targeted development processes play a key

role in this. Upstream from these is the search for new
technologies and market trends, which are systematically
identified and evaluated on an ongoing basis, in order to
specifically carry over the most promising ideas to new
development projects and then to establish ourselves on

the market with new solutions. The important thing is to
consider the regional market conditions and the needs of our
customers in the development process from the outset. In the
coming financial year 2014/2015 we plan to make additional
strategic research investments in the field of ophthalmology.
The projects started and currently underway require up-front
investments over a period of at least three years. Currently,
an expense of around € 10 million is expected in the coming
financial year. For better comparison, starting from the first
quarter of 2014/2015 we shall report investments allocated
to this area of application separately.

Future investments

Investments are a basic requirement to be able to maintain
our technology leadership in future. The investment ratio at
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has largely been constant in the
past few years. The investments required to realize growth
targets shall not lead to a material change in the current
investment ratio in the coming financial year. We aim to
invest around 1% to 3% of revenue in property, plant and
equipment in financial year 2014/2015, which is about the
same as in previous years.

Future dividend policy

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG pursues a long-term and earnings-
oriented dividend policy. The Company's management plans
to propose to the Annual General Meeting the distribution

of a dividend of € 0.40 per share for the past financial year.
The dividend ratio would therefore be 43.4%, which would
roughly correspond to the ratio for the previous year (previous
year 39.1%). The management also intends to allow
shareholders to continue to participate fairly in the Company's
success in future. The special dividend, an instrument that has
been used several times in the past, may also be used again.

Future employee development

Our employees are indispensable for the Company's success
we need them to be able to continue to work innovatively
and profitably in future. It is equally important to us to keep
investing in the further development of our existing employees
in future, as well as to recruit well qualified specialists

and managers for the Company. We therefore expect our
workforce to grow in the coming periods in line with the
growth of the Company's business.

Future financial position

Interest income and expenses depend on changes in interest
rates on the financial markets. At present, the Company
does not expect any marked improvements in investment
conditions in the next two years. Interest income and interest
expenses are thus expected to remain around the previous
year’s level. As of 30 September 2014 current cash and cash
equivalents of around € 293.3 million were available for
financing. In view of this, as well as the ongoing expectation
of positive business development and a positive cash flow
from operating activities as a result, and the possibility to
use other financial instruments and sources of financing,

if necessary, we consider the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's
financing capacity to be adequate. In 2014/2015 we aim

to achieve operative cash flow in the high double-digit
millions, based on active working capital management.

Future opportunities

The global medical technology market is characterized by
fundamentally sustainable growth. This applies to both
ophthalmology and microsurgery and assures us of good
selling conditions for the Company.

We continue to foresee a high level of growth, particularly
in the rapidly developing economies (RDEs) in Asia and

Latin America. We plan to further strengthen our market
presence and exploit the existing potential there, in order to
further consolidate our position in these markets. Additional
opportunities are provided by our innovative and broad
product range, which we shall continue to expand in the
coming financial year. Our strong financial profile, which
safeguards the Company's development against external
influences, should also have a positive effect. The Company
is in a position to protect itself against direct risks in the short
term, without losing sight of its long-term objectives. Due to


--- Page 36 ---

our ZEISS brand, our customers perceive us as a reliable and
trustworthy partner, and we look back on a long, successful
collaboration. We can therefore build upon an extremely
positive brand image.

Our development in future shall also include external growth
opportunities in some areas. Using a systematic process, we
shall look for strategically useful expansion opportunities,
which we shall evaluate and follow up, where appropriate.
It is not possible at this point to gauge how feasible such
opportunities might be.

Overall assertion on future development

At the time of publication of this Annual Report the
management of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group considers the
outlook for the coming financial year to be positive. This
assumption is based on the persistent long-term trends: An
ever-growing global population and the constantly growing
number of older people associated with an increasing life
expectancy. This is particularly significant for ophthalmology,
since the incidence of diseases in this field is strongly related
to the advanced age of the patients. Better and better access
to medical care in the emerging economies also offers long-
term potential for growth for medical technology products.
Accordingly, the Company's management assumes that the
demand for products and solutions of Carl Zeiss Meditec will
continue to increase in the next financial year.

General economic conditions and economic development

are crucial to making a forecast about the future development
of business. Given the large number of imponderables in

the individual regions in the year under review and the
increasingly high level of uncertainty with regard to future
development, the Company's management plans to keep

a close eye on the further course of general business so that
it can react to any changes in good time. Staying in regular
contact with our customers shall play an important role in this.
The investment behavior of our customers depends heavily on
economic development. Planned investments in the private
sector may be delayed, or significant cuts in public budgets
may adversely affect demand.

Given the generally favorable conditions for market
development in the medium and long term, and the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group’s good strategic position, the Company's

MANAGEMENT REPORT

FINA

management assumes that revenue will continue to grow in
the coming financial year, provided that general economic
conditions remain stable. We anticipate revenue growth that
is at least on a par with the market growth expected for the
industry. From a current perspective, and excluding currency
effects, this corresponds to growth in the low to mid-single-
digit percentage range.

A crucial advantage for even greater stability of our overall
business is a higher proportion of revenue with case-number-
dependent products and services, since there is generally less
fluctuation in these areas than in the capital goods business,
for example. We already achieved our objective of increasing
this share of revenue to 25% by 2015 in reporting year
2012/2013 — two years earlier than planned. In financial year
2013/2014 we achieved a share of 28%. From a current
perspective, we expect a further increase in financial year
2014/2015. In the medium term we aim to increase this
revenue share to over 30% of consolidated revenue by
financial year 2018/2019.

In financial year 2013/2014 the EBIT margin decreased
from 14.6% in the previous year to 13.3%. This decline
was attributable, among other things, to acquisition effects
and negative currency effects, as well as the disappointing
earnings situation in the “Ophthalmic Systems” SBU. For
the next financial year, we are planning strategic research
investments in a new area for the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group,
which shall impact the EBIT margin in the short term.
Nevertheless, the EBIT margin is expected to remain within
the range of 13% to 15%, and thus at an attractive level,
in financial year 2014/2015 and in the medium term until
financial year 2018/2019.

In terms of free cash flow for financial year 2014/2015, we
anticipate a figure that is still well into the double-digit
millions. We are aiming for a slight improvement in Economic
Value Added (EVA) in the coming financial year.

If there are any significant changes in the economic
environment currently forecast over the course of the financial
year, and should it thus become necessary to amend the
statements made here on business development from today’s
perspective, we shall publish these amendments promptly and
specify our expectations in more detail
