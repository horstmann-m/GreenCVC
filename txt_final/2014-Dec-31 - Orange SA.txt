The Group
Overview

1.1. Overview

Orange is one of the world’s leading telecommunications operators
with revenues of 39 billion euros and 156,000 employees worldwide
(including 99,400 in France) at December 31, 2014. With operations
in 29 countries, the Group served 244 million customers at
December 31, 2014, including 185 million mobile customers and

History

Orange, formerly France Telecom, is France’s incumbent tele-
communications operator. The Group has its origins in the Ministry for
Mail, Telegraphs and Telephone, later to become the General
Directorate of Telecommunications, which in 1990 was accorded the
status of independent public entity and, on January 1, 1991, renamed
France Telecom. On December 31, 1996, France Telecom became a
Société Anonyme (limited company) with the French State as its sole
shareholder. In October 1997, France Telecom shares were listed on
he Paris and New York stock exchanges allowing the French
government to sell 25% of its shares to the public and Group
employees. Subsequently, the government gradually reduced its
holding to 58%. The Law of December 31, 2003 authorized the
ransfer of the Company to the private sector and between 2004 and
2008 the State sold a further 26% of the share capital. At
December 31, 2014, the French State retained 25.04% of the shares,
held either directly or jointly with Bpifrance.

Since the 1990s, France Telecom’s area of activity and its regulatory
and competitive environment have undergone significant changes. In
a context of increased deregulation and competition, between 1999
and 2002, the Group pursued a strategy of developing new services
and accelerated its international growth with a number of strategic
investments. These included, in particular, acquiring mobile operator
Orange and the Orange brand, which had been created in 1994, and
taking a stake in Poland’s incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja
Polska (renamed Orange Polska in 2013). Most of these investments
could not be financed by share issues and therefore the Group’s debt
substantially increased during this period.

At the end of 2002, France Telecom started a large-scale refinancing
plan for its debt to reinforce its balance sheet, as well as an
operational improvements program, the success of which has allowed
the Group to develop a global integrated-operator strategy by
anticipating changes in the telecommunications industry.

Revenues (in euros)

France 47.0%

Mobiles customers

16 million fixed broadband customers. Orange is also a leading
provider of telecommunication services to multinational companies,
under the brand Orange Business Services.

Orange has been listed since 1997 on Nyse Euronext Paris (symbol:
ORA) and on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: ORAN).

n 2005, France Telecom acquired 80% of Spanish mobile operator
Amena, whose activities were then regrouped with the Group’s fixed-
ine and Internet operations in Spain into a single entity under the
Orange brand. In 2008 and 2009, the Group acquired almost all the
remaining capital of Orange Espana.

n parallel, the Group streamlined its asset portfolio by selling off non-
strategic subsidiaries and holdings.

n 2006, Orange became the single brand of the Group for Internet,
elevision and mobile services in most countries where the Group
operates, and Orange Business Services the brand for services
offered to businesses throughout the world.

Since 2007, Orange has pursued a selective policy for the development
and management of its activities, mainly focused on emerging
markets (in particular Africa and the Middle East), while attempting to
grasp opportunities for consolidation in markets where the Group was
already present. In 2010 this strategy notably led the Group to raise
its stake in Egyptian operator ECMS (Mobinil) from 36% to 94% (and
‘0 99% in February 2015). It also resulted in the joint venture with
Deutsche Telekom that combined UK business under the EE brand
on April 1, 2010, as well as in the 2012 disposal of Orange Suisse.

n 2014 and early 2015, this policy continued with the disposal of
Orange Dominicana and the conclusion of agreements with BT to
dispose of the Group’s stake in EE, in addition to the implementation
of the project to acquire Jazztel in Spain.

From July 1, 2013, the Company adopted the corporate name Orange.

n March 2015, the Group presented its new strategic plan for 2020:

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

At the end of 2014, the Orange Group grew its worldwide customer
base by 3% year-on-year, adding an additional 6.9 million customers
to 244.2 million, including 185.3 million mobile customers (excluding
MVNOs) (up 3.9%) and 16 million broadband customers (up 3.5%).

This increase reflects the continued strength of growth in mobile
phone services in Africa and the Middle East, where numbers rose
11.9% onacomparable basis to 97.5 million customers at December 31,
2014 (an additional 10.4 million mobile customers). In Africa, the
Orange Money application had 12.6 million customers, compared
with 8.9 million in 2013.

In France, mobile contracts — which accounted for 81% of the mobile
customer base at December 31, 2014 (22 million customers) — increased
by 5.8%.

In other European countries, mobile contracts also grew (by 5% on
the year to 35.5 million customers at December 31, 2014), notably in
Spain, the UK, Poland, Romania, Belgium and Slovakia, and made
up 58.4% of the mobile customer base at December 31, 2014.

2014 saw the continued development of high-capacity 4G mobile
broadband in France with 3.7 million customers and 74% population
coverage, in Spain with 2.3 million customers and 70% population

coverage, and in Poland with 613,000 customers and 61% population
coverage, together with the commercial launch of 4G services in
Belgium, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia.

Fixed broadband had 16 million customers at December 31, 2014, a
3.5% increase on the year, i.e. 546,000 additional customers,
including 273,000 in Spain and 245,000 in France. Fixed broadband
access at December 31, 2014 included 691,000 fiber optic accesses,
of which 563,000 were in France (+81.5%).

The Group's consolidated revenues for 2014 were 39.445 billion euros,
down 2.5% on a comparable basis. Price reductions linked to
regulatory measures remain significant. Excluding regulatory measures,
the fall in revenues is limited to 1.6%.

The Group continued its adaptation in 2014 by cutting operating costs
by 707 million euros (including more than 70% in indirect costs), which
offset 69% of its fall in revenues.

At the same time, Orange maintained its development capacity by
increasing its investments by 1.3% on a comparable basis compared
with 2013, notably in high-capacity mobile broadband and fiber optic
solutions. Total investments amounted to 5.636 billion euros in 2014,
i.e. arate of investment of 14.3% of revenues.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world information and communication technologies market

This chapter contains forward-looking statements, particularly in
Section 2.3 Orange’s group strategy. These forward-looking
statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in

2.1
technologies market

2014 was marked by continued growth in the information and
communication technologies segment (ICT), which includes mainly
the sectors of computing, audiovisual, multimedia, Internet and
telecommunications: after the recovery recorded in 2013, growth in
ICT revenues accelerated in 2014 to +4.2% (+1 point compared to
2018), and totaled 3,625 billion euros.

The ICT market remains an essential component of economic growth
driven by innovation and represents an important source of value
creation through the distribution of new services and new uses.
Among these are, in particular, growth areas chosen by Orange:

= the enormous quantity of information generated by social and
commercial interactions that passes through communication
networks (Big Data);

Market growth by region

the forward-looking statements. The most significant risks are detailed
in Section 2.4 Risk factors. Please also consult the information under
the heading Forward-looking information at the start of this document.

The world information and communication

= intelligent communications between machines or between people
and machines (Internet of things);

= the growing storage of information on remote computer servers
accessible via the Internet (Cloud Computing).

These sources of value creation rely on a generalized connectivity that
places telecommunications at the core of the digital transformation of
the economy. Revenues of telecom services, however, stood at 1,216
billion euros in 2014 for a +2.5% increase, at a slower rhythm than
that of all ICT services (+4.2%), and their relative share of the ICT
market thus declined (figure 1).

Europe

The market for innovative digital services is growing in Europe but it is
largely captured by handset manufacturers and non-European Internet
players, to the detriment of telecom operators (source: Etude Economie
des Télécoms 2014 (Economic Study of Telecoms), Arthur D. Little).

n most European countries, operators’ margins declined under the
effect of lower prices resulting from the increasing competition among
‘elecommunications operators (including cable operators) and the
effect of industry regulations (in particular international roaming
revenues). Moreover, operators are experiencing competition from
offers of Over the top (OTT) players that generally offer their services
0 users for free (being remunerated by advertising).

n 2014, revenues of European telecom services thus recorded a
ourth year of shrinkage since 2010, although the decline slowed over
he year (-0.7% compared to -2.7% in 2013). Europe thus remains
he least dynamic region in the world in terms of growth, and its weight
in the world market now only represents 24%.

USA

The +4.2% growth in the ICT market in 2014 was particularly high
avored particularly through the development of social networks. It
represents in fact the strongest growth recorded in three years, even
hough the growth in the US GDP remained stable at approximately
+2% over the same period.

Revenues from telecom services reached 307 billion euros, up by
+2.7% for a slight improvement over 2013 (+2.4%). The share of
elecom services remains almost stable at 27% of the whole ICT
services market.

Africa and the Middle East

n 2014, the growth in the ICT market is still very high at 6.5%,
remaining above GDP growth that rose somewhat in 2014 to +3.3%

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world information and communication technologies market

(compared to 3.1% in 2013). The potential of this region in which the
Orange Group is very present remains strong, in connection with
major access infrastructure equipment needs and in spite of political
risks, the deadly effects of the Ebola epidemic, and a heterogeneity
between Africa and the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa whose
instability inhibits growth.

Telecom services that represent 47% of the ICT market are up by
6.3%, higher than that of the world market overall, but slowing down
compared to 2012 and 2013. Revenues of telecom services totaled
101 billion euros, for an 8.3% share of the world market, the weakes'
compared to the other regions in the world.

South America

In spite of the advanced maturity of services, the opening to marke
competition created a strong dynamic of equipment and uses.
Moreover, GDP growth at around 5.5% in the last three years remains
sustained and one of the highest in the world.

The growth momentum in the ICT market has stayed high for the las
three years at approximately 7% (+6.5% in 2014). Telecom services
represent nearly 40% of the ICT market in 2014 with sustained growth
in 2014 (+4.3%).

Revenues of telecom services stood at 121 billion euros, representing
10% of the world market.

Asia Pacific

This region, that includes both advanced economies and emerging
countries, recorded a +5.8% growth in the ICT market or 1,100
billion euros. Economically, the region also posted high GDP growth,
especially in China (+7.4%). Revenues of telecom services that
reached 399 billion euros in 2014, for growth of 3.4%, represent 33%
of the world market, the largest share of all regions worldwide. In this
region, telecom services represent more than one third of the
revenues of the ICT, in spite of a 1.5 point slowdown in 2014
compared to 2013.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world information and communication technologies market

Key trends and developments

Convergence of services and market
consolidation

The growth in mobile access with the development of 4G, the high
penetration of smartphones and M2M throughout the world constitutes
amajor component of the momentum of the telecommunication sector.
Convergence is also a major trend, particularly in Europe since it allows
operators that have both fixed and mobile network infrastructures to
conquer and keep their customers, faced with the competition of fixed-
line only (as often the cable operators) or mobile only operators. This
convergence results in the development of so-called “quadruplay” offers
(voice, Internet, television, mobile). Convergence is also illustrated by
the growing use of WiFi in mobile networks. On their side, the cable
operators also include WiFi in their offers to counter the quadruplay
offers of telecom operators.

One can simultaneously observe a movement toward consolidation
of players, both in Europe and the USA, linked to this convergence of
networks and services, as well as the necessity of acquiring a larger
size whereas the pressure on prices is stronger and infrastructure
investments are indispensable.

In Europe, mergers have been carried out between fixed-line and
mobile operators such as the acquisition of the fixed-line operator
Kabel Deutschland in Germany and the acquisition of SFR and Virgin
Mobile in France by Altice (parent company of the cable operator
Numéricable), and the purchase of Groupo Corporativo by Vodafone
in Spain. Projects to acquire EE by BT in the United Kingdom and
Jazztel by Orange in Spain follow the same logic of alliances between
fixed and mobile activities. Moreover, since 2013 consolidation
operations have reduced the number of mobile operators in Austria,
Germany and Ireland from four to three. Cable has also been at the
center of many transactions with Liberty Global that took control of
Virgin Media in United Kingdom and Ziggo in the Netherlands.

In the USA, the merger of Comcast with Time Warner cable, respectively
the number 1 and number 2 cable companies there, is little different
in nature since these operators operate in different territories and
together cover nearly one third of Internet accesses. Authorities in
charge of competition have thus not had to fear a reduction in
consumer choices from this alliance, whose objective is to limit the
growing cost of program expenses, faced with production studios.
There is also the merger of AT&T with Direct TV in the USA. Finally, in
Brazil, Telefonica bought the telecom operator GVT in 2014.

Development of networks and growth
of telecommunications uses in the world

In Africa and the Middle East, Internet access networks are developing
mainly via the deployment of 3G mobile networks, whereas in Europe
investments in networks are concentrated in high capacity broadband
access, with the development of fixed-line offers on fiber referred to
as FTTH (Fiber To The Home) and the deployment of 4G mobile
networks. In parallel, operators are developing their networks to make
them more agile and simpler to manage (with “virtualization”) and more
open (with API).

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

Uses are exploding under the combined effect of the deployment of
new networks, the increase in the capacities of existing networks and
he growth in the rate of penetration of more and more sophisticated
mobile handsets. The explosion in uses is mainly driven by video, and
by the increase in the number of screens (computers, smartphones,
ablets, readers, connected TVs, connected watches).

New expectations of consumers
and businesses

Digital technologies are now systematically part of all key areas of life
of consumers: family, home, wellness, entertainment, work and
money. Connected objects will see an exponential growth and some
orecasts indicate for example about 25 billion objects connected in
2020 (source: GSMA Understanding the Internet of things, July 2014).
These concern more and more areas such as domotics (home
automation), automobile, health, energy and wellness, and are likely
0 be integrated in all industries and services over time. With this in
mind, consumers have strong expectations on the quality and reliability
of the communications networks, but also on the personalization of
he relation with their operator, and protection of their personal data.
Companies, themselves, need to be assisted in their digital transformation,
or their internal needs and their customer relations.

Evolution of the model and revenues
of operators

Connectivity services will continue to make up the largest part of
revenues of telecommunications operators. These services are indeed
linked to the continuous growth of the Internet, to the growth in uses
and the multiplication of connected objects.

Other sources of revenues for operators will reside in the ability to
monetize new services related to changes in their networks and
services platforms, to applications suppliers and residential and
business customers. These are in particular:

= new models of access to IT (Information Technology) platforms
through API interfaces (Application Programming Interfaces) tha’
will strengthen the independence of users to implement themselves
personalized services;

innovative technologies such as data analysis (Big Data), Interne’
of Things (loT) or M2M (Machine to Machine), that allow companies
to improve their performance through better knowledge of their
customers or better management of their industrial processes;

= the use of operators’ access through partnerships with Interne
actors by including the most requested over the top services in
service options;

mobile financial services;

= secure management of data and transactions by operators as well
as the development of their role as trusted third parties.

harmonized in the EU member states where the Orange Group operates,
with National Regulatory Authorities obliged to implement common EU
rules at the national level, though some national differences remain.

This common regulatory framework is presented below with a detailed
description for each major country in which the Orange Group
operates").

On November 1, 2014, the new European Commission led by Jean-
Claude Juncker took office. DG Connect, the Directorate General for
Communications Networks, Content & Technology, has two
commissioners:

= Andrus Ansip, Vice-President for the Digital Single Market; and
= Gunther Oettinger, Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society.

Finally, Jyrki Katainen, Vice-President of the Commission for Jobs,
Growth, Investment and Competitiveness, is responsible for steering
the European infrastructure investment program, including investments
in the digital economy.

2.2.1.1

The general EU legal framework for electronic communications
consists of five main directives deriving from the 2002 Telecom
Package:

= Framework Directive 2002/21/EC of March 7, 2002, on acommon
regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and
services;

= Authorization Directive 2002/20/EC of March 7, 2002, on the
authorization of electronic communications networks and services;

- Access Directive 2002/19/EC of March 7, 2002, on access to, and
interconnection of, electronic communications networks and
associated facilities;

Legal and regulatory framework

= Universal Service Directive 2002/22/EC of March 7, 2002, on
universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic
communications networks and services;

= Directive on Privacy and electronic communications 2002/58/EC
of July 12, 2002, concerning the processing of personal data and
the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Regulations

All five directives were reviewed in 2009, with changes fully transposed
by EU member states, and were subsequently placed under the
oversight of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic
Communications, BEREC®).

On October 9, 2014, the European Commission approved a new
recommendation (2014/7 10/EV) identifying four relevant product and
service markets susceptible to ex ante regulation compared to seven
in its previous recommendation made in 2007:

= M1: wholesale call termination on individual public telephone
networks provided at a fixed location;

= M2: wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks;
= M3:
a) wholesale local access provided at a fixed location,

b) wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for mass-
market products;

= M4: wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location.

The Commission has dropped from the list the retail market for access
to the public telephone network at a fixed location for residential and
non-residential customers (M 1/2007) and call origination on the public
telephone network provided at a fixed location (M 2/2007). It also
adjusted the scope of wholesale markets for fixed access (M 4, M5
and M 6/2007).

This regulatory framework has been fleshed out with a number of
additional texts.

Roaming

Regulation No. 5381/2012, adopted on June 13, 2012 by the European
Parliament and Council, on roaming on public mobile communications
networks within the Union (Roaming III):

= introduces, for the wholesale market, a regulated right of access to
European roaming services for MVNOs and resellers;

= extends the sliding cap on roaming rates to the retail data market;

= introduces, as of July 1, 2014, two structural changes to increase
competition in the retail market by separating domestic services
and international roaming services;

= expands, for customers using their cell phones outside the EU, pricing
transparency requirements and bill shock prevention measures for
European operators.

On April 3, 2014 the European Parliament voted to approve a Commission proposal put forward the previous September in a legislative
resolution concerning the “European single market for electronic communications”. One of its main aims was to amend the Roaming III
regulations that would ban surcharging for roaming within the EU by the end of 2015 (see Section 2.2.1.2).

Call termination rates

On May 7, 2009, the European Commission adopted a recommendation regulating fixed-line and mobile call termination rates in the EU
(2009/396/EC).

The Commission recommends that national authorities should apply the following principles:

= symmetry in each country between the various operators’ fixed voice call termination rates and also between their mobile call termination
rates, with the option of allowing a four-year transitional asymmetry on fixed or mobile call termination rates to benefit a new entrant;

= call termination rates geared towards the avoidable cost of this service for an efficient operator (i.e. about 1 euro cent per minute for voice
MTRs and a lower rate for voice FTRs).

The recommendation has been implemented as follows in the countries where the Orange Group operates:

Protecting Personal Data

A general directive (1995/46/EC) encompasses the processing of
personal data in the European Union. It was followed by a directive
specific to the electronic communications sector (2002/58/EC).

On January 25, 2012 the European Commission unveiled a major plan
for updating the existing framework with a proposed Regulation that
would replace the 1995 directive and stand alongside the sectorial
directive. The new rules would increase harmonization between
member states and strengthen legal rights. The legislative process is
still ongoing. On March 12, 2014 the European Parliament approved a
proposal for a regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to
the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data
(General Data Protection Regulation). The European Council reached
a policy agreement on several parts of the text in June, October and
December 2014 but no general agreement has yet been reached.

Draft regulation on the European single market for
electronic communications

On September 11, 2013, the European Commission adopted several
proposed regulations to achieve a single market in electronic
communications, including: the Connected Continent draft regulation,
a recommendation on non-discrimination obligations and consistent
costing methodologies and a statement specifying the guidelines for
the creation of a single market for telecommunications, which it argues
is urgently needed.

Connected Continent Project

The proposed regulations for a single market adopted by the European
Commission mainly address the following points:

= simplification of European regulation for operators (e.g. single
authorization);

= end of roaming charges and international call premium for
intra-European calls; ban on roaming charges and alignment of
the price of services with national prices;

= Internet neutrality: rules to preserve the open Internet;

= consumer protection new rights and harmonization of all consumer
rights across the European Union;

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

= radio spectrum and 4G: greater coordination of the timing,
duration and other terms and conditions when assigning radio
frequencies;

- simplification of wholesale access products: standardized
conditions and features of wholesale access products on fixed-line
networks.

On April 3, 2014 the European Parliament adopted its position at first
reading on the proposed regulation for a European single market in
electronic communications prepared by the European Commission.
The European Parliament position focuses on net neutrality and a ban
on charges for roaming between EU countries by 2015 (Roam Like
At Home). Consumer protection provisions would be included in the
universal service directive.

On December 17, 2014, BEREC published its analysis of the text
adopted by the the European Parliament at first reading. The European
Council, meeting at the end of November 2014, made the resolution
of Roam Like At Home a precondition of any discussion of the European
single market in electronic communications with the European Parliament.

Recommendation “on non-discrimination obligations and
consistent costing methodologies to promote competition
and enhance the broadband investment environment”

The recommendation adopted by the European Commission on
September 12, 2013, seeks to:

= strengthen rules on non-discrimination to provide equivalent access
on new networks, publication of performance indicators and the
application of technical replicability tests;

= stabilize prices, at constant currency, for use of the copper network
around the current average access price within the EU (8 to
10 euros at current rates excluding tax); and

= allow greater flexibility in pricing high capacity broadband as national
regulators have the option of not imposing a cost-based system
where strengthened non-discrimination rules are in place and there
is effective competition between platforms (copper, cable, mobile).

In September 2014 BEREC published a draft guidance document
“Guidance on the regulatory accounting approach to the economic
replicability test (i.e. ex ante/sector specific margin squeeze tests)”
and launched a public consultation on this project.

Statement specifying the guidelines for the creation
of a single market for telecommunications, which
it argues is urgently needed

The statement issued by the Commission specifies policy guidelines
for structuring issues not covered by the draft regulations or the
recommendation. It stresses the challenges facing the EU, particularly
the modernization of regulations, investment and the need to set rules
that are fair to both operators and over-the-top (OTT) players.

Rollout of broadband communication networks:
directive on measures to reduce the cost of deploying
high-speed electronic communications networks

On May 15, 2014 the European Parliament and Council adopted a
directive designed to facilitate and encourage the rollout of high-speed
electronic communications networks by promoting shared use of
existing infrastructure (including the network infrastructure of other
utilities) and allowing more efficient rollout of new physical infrastructure
to reduce the costs of building these networks. Member states must
adopt the necessary regulations to comply with this directive by
January 1, 2016. The directive will come into force on July 1, 2016.

Universal Service

In November 2011 the European Commission published a statement
presenting the key results of the third revision of the scope of universal
service. It concluded that there is no reason to extend the obligations
of universal service to mobile services or broadband Internet connection.

The Commission's draft recommendation of February 18, 2013 had
expressed reservations about making broadband part of the universal
service obligation. In its report of October 24, 2013 the European
Parliament asked the Commission to think again. As part of a fourth
review of the scope of the universal service, the European Commission
launched a study in October 2014. No draft recommendation has yet
been approved.

Connecting Europe Facility

To help implement its Digital Agenda, the European Commission plans
to invest up to 9.2 billion euros through its Connecting Europe Facility
between 2014 and 2020 to expand broadband networks and set up
pan-European digital services like cross-border online administration
and e-health services. In December 2013, the European Parliament
and Council allocated 1.14 billion euros to the telecommunications sector.

European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI)

The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker,
announced on November 26, 2014 the creation of a European Fund
for Strategic Investment (EFSI) to stimulate economic growth. The
digital sector will be one of the main beneficiaries. The fund, launched
with 16 billion euros of finance from the EU budget and 5 billion euros
from the European Investment Bank aims to unlock 315 billion euros
of funds for investment in 2016/2017.

The Commission published the draft regulations setting up the EFSI
on January 13, 2015.

4G Frequency Band

The European Commission’s ambition for high-capacity broadband
infrastructure, set out in its Connected Continent project, is a long
way from being achieved. The Commission notes that the EU has lost
ime in rolling out 4G infrastructure due to the late and uncoordinated
allocation of spectrum. It plans to take a firmer coordinating and
harmonizing role on the timing and processes for allocating 4G
spectrum.

First digital dividend: On May 6, 2010 the European Commission
decided to allow the 800 MHz frequency band, previously used for
errestrial analog TV, to be repurposed for mobile communication
services.

It also authorized the refarming of GSM spectrum for LTE use. In its
decision 2009/766/EC of October 16, 2009, on the harmonization of
he 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz frequency bands, amended on April 18,

2.2.2.1 Legal and regulatory framework

Legal framework

The electronic communications sector is primarily governed by the
rench Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE) as well
as legal provisions relating to e-commerce, the information society,
consumer protection and data protection.

a

The French government transposed the European Telecoms Package,
as amended in 2009, into national law via the Ministerial Order of
August 24, 2011 and the Decree of March 12, 2012, implementing
regulations.

The audiovisual communication services produced or distributed by
the Orange Group come under the specific regulations governing this
sector and are managed by the law of September 30, 1986").

Regulatory Authorities

The Postal and Electronic Communications Regulatory Authority
(the Arcep) is an independent administrative body created by the law
of July 26, 1996 and acts as French regulator for these sectors
nationwide. The Arcep’s main missions in electronic communications
are to set regulations (general or specific obligations) for operators
within its jurisdiction. It has powers to sanction non-compliant
operators and can rule on disputes between operators over technical
and pricing conditions for network access and interconnection. The
Arcep also allocates spectrum and numbering resources. Finally, it

2011, the European Commission asked member states to ensure
these bands were technically neutral and so available for 4G services.
In a complementary decision on November 5, 2012 the Commission
required member states to introduce technological neutrality to the
2.1 GHz band (1,920-1,980 MHz/2,110-2,170 MHz) to allow the use
of 4G (LTE) in this part of the spectrum before May 24, 2016.

Discussions are also underway to eventually create a second digital
dividend in the 700 MHz band for mobile services. The World
Radiocommunication Conference of 2012 decided in principle to open
up the 700 MHz band in ITU region 1 (Europe and Africa) for mobile
services. The next conference, to be held in November 2015, will lay
down technical specifications and should then allocate bands for
mobile services.

On January 12, 2014 the European Commission launched a three-
month public consultation on the recommendations of the Pascal
Lamy Report, published September 2014, on a long-term strategy for
future use of UHF spectrum (470-790 MHz). The aim is to define a
position on the best way to take forward these recommendations.

One recommendation is that member states should make the 700
MHz band available for wireless broadband in 2020 or 2022.

New rule on application of telecommunications VAT

On April 3, 2014, the Commission published explanatory notes
clarifying the new VAT rules that will apply to the electronic
communications, broadcast and electronic services sectors as from
January 1, 2015. The main change is that VAT will be billed in the
home country of the buyer rather than the seller.

determines the size of contributions to fund the universal service
obligation and oversees the mechanisms for delivering this funding.

The French Competition Authority, established in March 2009
following the restructuring of the French Competition Council, is an
independent government authority responsible for ensuring open
market competition and compliance with public economic policy. It
has jurisdiction over all business segments, including the electronic
communications sector. It has sanction powers for anti-competitive
practices, as well as consultative powers. It also specializes in
overseeing mergers and acquisitions.

The ANFr (Agence Nationale des Fréquences — French national
agency for frequencies) is responsible for planning, managing and
controlling the usage of radio frequencies and for coordinating the
establishment of certain radio transmission facilities. The frequency
spectrum is covered by 11 controlling authorities: government
ministries, the Arcep and the French Broadcasting Authority (CSA).
The Arcep and the CSA are in turn responsible for allotting to users
the frequencies they control.

The CSA is an independent administrative body created by the law
of January 17, 1989, tasked with protecting freedom of audiovisual
communication by means of any electronic communications
technology as regards radio and television in accordance with the Law
of September 30, 1986. In July, 2013 the CSA was partly reformed
and a Commission for the modernization of audiovisual broadcasting
is to be created and given responsibility for the radio spectrum.

Allocation of spectrum in overseas territories

In November 2014 the Arcep presented its plans for allocating 800
MHz, 900 MHz, 1.8 GHz, 2.1 GHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum in the
French overseas territories. The system used will be a “beauty
contest” to be held in 2015 for Guadeloupe and Martinique in one lot
and Saint-Marin and Saint-Barthélemy, in another. The procedure for
Guyana and La Réunion-Mayotte will take place at a later date.

Digital dividend -700 MHz band

The French President decided in May 2018 to allocate the whole of
the 700 MHz band to electronic communications.

On December 10, 2014 the Prime Minister set out the key calendar
dates for transferring the 700 MHz band of spectrum. The decision

on which electronic communications operators will get the spectrum
will be made in December 2015 and the transfer will take effect
between October 1, 2017 and June 30, 2019, except for some zones
where the operators will be able to start using it in April 2016.

On December 16, 2014 the Arcep began a two-month consultation
process, a “strategic review of spectrum for high-capacity broadband”.
This will notably investigate what it can do to help modernize the
mobile networks (repurposing of existing spectrum with more effective
technologies and opening up of new frequencies).

On January 8, 2015 the Prime Minister’s Order on reallocating the 700
MHz band to the Arcep (2*30 MHz) for high-capacity mobile uses was
published in the French government's Official Journal. It allocated the
703-733 MHz and 758-788 MHz bands to the Arcep, initially jointly
with the CSA as from December 1, 2015 and exclusively from July 1,
2019. Details of the gradual award of audiovisual broadcasting will be
specified subsequently.

SMS TR

On January 29, 2015 the Arcep decided to withdraw its draft decision
concerning analysis of the wholesale SMS termination markets for
2014-2017, which had proposed extending the current regime for a
further three years. It put these markets under surveillance. The
European Commission had launched an in-depth investigation into
this draft decision and asked the Arcep to provide extra justification.
The European Commission and Arcep failed to reach agreement on
the competitive risks and what regulations would be needed to
counter them.

Mobile service quality

The Arcep published, on June 24, 2014, the results of its survey on
mobile service quality, in which Orange was ranked sole or equal first
on 246 of 258 criteria.

2.2.2.3 Regulation of fixed telephony,
broadband and superfast broadband
Internet

Since July 2008, except for retail offerings for fixed telephony under
universal service, all of Orange’s regulatory obligations concerning
retail fixed telephony (access and communication) on the consumer
and business markets have been lifted. Ex ante regulation of Orange’s
fixed-line services relates to retail offerings under the universal service
and wholesale offerings that are regulated to ensure effective competition
in the retail markets (call origination and termination, wholesale line
rental, unbundling, bitstream).

Orange’s obligations regarding cost accounting
and accounting separation in the fixed-line business

The Arcep’s decision no. 06-1007 of December 7, 2006 sets forth
Orange’s obligations as to cost accounting and accounting separation
in the wholesale and retail businesses. When retail activities make use
of wholesale network services that are subject to accounting
separation, these resources are recognized in regulatory accounts at
the wholesale price. These obligations were first implemented in 2007
in respect of FY2006. The financial year was deemed compliant by
the Arcep and has been extended to every year since.

Regulation of fiber optic networks

Regulatory framework governing very high-capacity
broadband wholesale offers:

asymmetric regulation of access to civil engineering infrastructure
which allows alternative operators to deploy their horizontal
networks on Orange’s infrastructure: non-discriminatory access at
a rate that reflects costs;

principle that the terminating segment of FTTH networks are
mutualized between operators;

= no asymmetric access obligation (unbundling or bitstream) for fiber
optic in high-density areas, confirmed by Arcep decisions on the
analysis of markets 4 and 5 on June 26, 2014;

= symmetrical regulation of access to the terminating segment of
H networks including outside high-density areas: same
obligations to offer passive access to the terminating segment of
FTTH networks on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms apply
0 all operators cabling buildings anywhere in France. This access
must be made available from a sharing point in a reasonable

location (Arcep decision no. 2009-1106 of December 22, 2009,
see also decision no. 2010-1312 of December 14, 2010). Charges
must be reasonable and compatible with the principles of efficiency,
relevance, objectivity and non-discrimination.

National Digital Agency

On February 4, 2015, the decree creating a service with national
authority was published in the Official Journal: the National Digital
Agency will bring together the “Superfast Broadband Program”,
French Tech and the Internet Uses Delegation.

The Agency will take over three responsibilities: steering and
implementation of the “France Superfast Broadband Program”,
coordinating and leading the various initiatives of French Tech,
overseeing the dissemination of digital tools and development of their
use.

It will have to coordinate with several other institutions, including the
Caisse des dépéts, BPI France, the National Digital Council, the Arcep
and other state services involved in digital development.

In November 2012 the French government had created a Superfast
Broadband Program to plan a ten-year rollout of superfast broadband.
The program helped develop a roadmap whose main points were
announced in February 2013.

The aim is to have 100% of the French population eligible for very high
capacity broadband by 2022, with an interim target of covering half
he population and companies by 2017. FTTH is seen as the main
way of achieving this, although other technologies are also expected
0 contribute (higher speed on copper as a transitional solution,
satellite, LTE). At the annual conference of the France Superfast
Broadband Program, held on February 6, 2014 the main lines of the
plan were confirmed.

A total 20 billion euros of private and public investment is estimated
be needed to meet the 2022 target. This breaks down into three parts:

io}

= one third of investment by private operators who expect to use their
own capital to deliver FTTH to 57% of French homes by 2022;

= the remaining 43% of homes will be covered by the other two-thirds
of investment, provided by government authorities to fund publicly
organized networks;

— for more than half of these homes, it has been decided to provide
FTTH coverage financed partly by public subsidy with the rest
provided by private operators,

— the remainder relates to coverage of the more rural zones by
complementary solutions (higher speed on copper, satellite, etc.)
jointly financed by the state and local authorities.

By January 12, 2015, 71 requests for subsidy under the France Superfast
Broadband Program had been filed by 84 counties (departments).

The eventual closure of the copper local loop is a major part of the
process. The government has appointed Paul Champsaur to set out
the conditions and timetable for the elimination of copper. The report,
delivered to the government on February 19, 2015, rules out any
government-ordered closing down the copper network. Any such
move remains in Orange’s hands. It notably includes the creation of
“fibered zones” which the government would designate under certain
conditions (whole zone served by FTTH networks, network
engineering compliant with regulations, etc.) triggering measures to
incentivize customers to migrate from copper to fiber.

SFR by the Altice group and its subsidiary Numericable Group. To -

offset the competitive risks identified by the authority, Altice and
Numericable groups made a number of structural commitments (to
sell assets) and behavioral undertakings that will apply for five years,
extendable once by another five years. These include:

selling the mobile telephony activities of Outremer Télécom in
La Réunion and Mayotte;

= selling Completel’s copper network;

opening up Numericable’s cable network by proposing two access
offers priced to prevent any margin squeeze on possible rivals: one
white label wholesale access offer for high-capacity broadband
aimed at MVNOs, and a second wholesale access offer aimed at
MVNOs and fixed-line operators;

undertakings regarding the FTTH deployment agreements that SFR
has with Bouygues Telecom and Orange;

confidentiality with respect to Vivendi.

Numericable buys Virgin Mobile

On November 27, 2014 the competition authorities issued decision
No. 14-DCC-179 approving the 100% takeover of Omer Telecom

Limited, a Virgin Mobile badged virtual mobile network operator, by
Numericable Group.

Orange / 2014 Registration Document
The Authority found that the identified competitive risks (leverage
through the marketing of offers combining high-capacity broadband
access with mobile telephony services) had already been countered
by Numericable’s commitments made when it bought SFR to allow
MVNOs to access its cable network.

Rollout of fiber optic networks and switch off
of the copper network

On January 21, 2014, the Arcep adopted a recommendation on FTTH
access for buildings with fewer than 12 residential or business
premises in high-density areas, and outside low-density pockets. This
expands on an earlier recommendation, issued June 14, 2011, and
provides for the installation of concentration points of 100 single fiber
lines to serve buildings of fewer than 12 homes, outside low-density
pockets. To provide complete coverage, the Arcep recommends a
prior consultation system is put in place to bring together all
stakeholders, including local authorities.

Moreover, the Arcep’s decision of January 27, 2014 reduced the number
of districts classed as in high-density areas from 148 to 106 districts.

On December 10, 2014, the Arcep launched a second public
consultation, due to run until January 20, 2015, and seek advice from
the Competition Authority about a draft decision on technical and
operational processes for the sharing of high-capacity broadband fiber
optic networks.

On December 17, 2014 the Arcep launched a second public
consultation, ending February 20, 2015, on a generic pricing model
for access to shared fiber optic networks outside high-density areas.

Reform of value-added services pricing

In March 2014, the Arcep published a recommendation on the
wholesale VAS interconnection market with a particular focus on the
relationship between originating and recipient operators, as part of the
implementation of the VAS pricing reform (decision No. 2012-0856).

On June 10, 2014, Arcep issued decision No. 2014-0661, postponing
the entry into force of VAS market reform until October 1, 2015 (initially
scheduled for January 1, 2015). This was to allow VAS publishers and
recipient operators adequate visibility to conduct their commercial
negotiations.

The VAS reform redefines pricing methods applied to calls to short
and special numbers (beginning with 08) which allow users to access
weather forecasts and distance sales services, for instance, as well
as government services. The reforms (i) create a uniform pricing model
for the retail services market irrespective of whether the originating
call is from fixed-line or mobile network, known as “C+S” for its two
components: the price of the call (C) and the price of the service (S)
defined by the provider and (ii) make calls which are currently free
when calling from a fixed line also free when calling from a mobile
number.

In December 2014, as part of two dispute resolution rulings, the Arcep
specified the conditions for implementing VAS reforms starting on
October 1, 2015. The rulings largely accepted the terms offered by
Orange when acting as a call origination operator.

Arcep opens two administrative inquiries

On May 27, 2014, the Arcep launched two administrative inquiries
concerning Orange and (i) its connection and telephony service
targets under the universal service obligation and (ii) the service quality
of wholesale offers to the enterprise market. There were several
exchanges of information between Orange and the Arcep (collection
of information, hearings, visits by intervention units). Orange put to
the Arcep a plan to improve the service quality offered on its fixed-line

Analysis of the fixed broadband and superfast fixed broadband
markets mid-2014 to mid-2017

On June 26, 2014, the Arcep issued three analysis decisions on the
fixed broadband and superfast broadband markets for mid-2014 to
mid-2017:

= decision No. 2014-0733 concerning analysis of the relevant
wholesale market for access to the physical network infrastructure
that composed the local loop (market 4);

decision No. 2014-0734 concerning analysis of the relevant
wholesale market within France for broadband and high-capacity
broadband (market 5);

decision No. 2014-0735 concerning analysis of the relevant
wholesale market for capacity services (market 6).

This was the first time Arcep had reviewed its analyses of markets 4,
5 and 6 simultaneously. The scopes for these three decisions were
changed to comply with changes made by the European Commission
recommendation of October 9, 2014 onthe relevant markets subject
to ex ante regulation, in order to make a distinction between wholesale
“generalist” offers aimed at the consumer and wholesale offers
targeting business needs. In this enterprise segment, Arcep decision
No. 2014-0735 will lift the pricing obligations on Orange (copper and
fiber) in some competitive geographical areas from January 1, 2015.

Analysis of relevant fixed-line telephony markets in 2014-2017

On September 30, 2014 the Arcep issued decision no. 2014-1102
on analysis of the relevant markets for fixed-line telephony in 2014-
2017. It prolonged the obligation imposed on Orange to provide
wholesale line rental (WLR) at cost-based prices. The decision
introduced a gradual relaxation of the pricing obligations imposed on
Orange for straight carrier selection offers. Finally, the decision lifts the
asymmetrical regulation imposed on Orange in the call origination
market for calls to value-added service (VAS) numbers, instead relying
exclusively on the symmetrical framework established by Arcep
decision No. 2007-0213.

Copper expert committee approves use of VDSL2
for all Orange’s local loop copper lines

In July 2014, the expert committee on copper systems recommended
allowing VDSL2 to be extended to alll lines running from an NRA on
Orange’s copper local loop.

VDSL2 is a technology that can significantly increase speeds over
copper for the shortest lines, compared to ADSL.

In an initial opinion issued in April 2013, the expert committee on
copper systems had, for technical reasons, restricted VDSL2 to
“direct supply” lines and lines attached to NRAs that were part of a
network overhaul.

Its second opinion in July 2014 gave operators the right, as from
October 27, 2014, to market VDSL2-based broadband and superfast
broadband throughout France (subject to the restriction on line length).

On December 10, 2014 Arcep published a “scorecard on the
introduction of VDSL2 in the 4" quarter 2014”. This showed that in
the 3° quarter 2014 VDSL2 was viable on lines serving 89.3% of the
population, that 4.7 million copper lines could now receive high-
capacity broadband and that VDSL2 would enable an average 62%
of the lines covered by a high-speed copper program to receive high-
capacity broadband.

Legal framework

The 2002 European Telecom Package was transposed into Spanish
law by the general Telecommunications Act (law No. 32/2003 of
November 3, 2003), Royal Decree No. 2296/2004 of December 10,
2004 on the electronic communications markets, network access and
numbering, and Royal Decree No. 424/2005 of April 15, 2005 on the
supply of electronic communications services, universal service
obligations and user rights.

The 2009 Telecom Package was transposed into Spanish law by
Royal Decree No. 726/2011 on universal service provision in May
2011 and Royal Decree No. 13/2012 of March 31, 2012.

The telecommunications sector is also covered by law No. 15/2007
of July 3, 2007 relating to the implementation of competition rules.

Law No. 34/2002 of July 11, 2002 relating to the information society
and electronic commerce specifies the obligations and limits of
responsibility applicable to service providers in the information society.

The regulatory framework applicable to data protection in Spain is
based around law No. 15/1999 of December 13, 1999, relating to
personal data protection and order No. 999/1999 relating to security
measures. In the field of intellectual property rights protection, law No.
23/2006 of July 7, 2006 amends law No. 1/1996 of April 12, 1996
and transposes European directive 2001/29/EC relating to the
harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the
information society.

Regulations

On December 19, 2014 the Arcep delivered a favorable opinion on
Orange’s request to raise monthly fixed-line Orange subscriptions to
17.96 euros including VAT/month from March 2015. At the same date,
prices for fixed-line and mobile calls from or to the French overseas
departments and calls to European fixed lines will be brought into line
with the national rates in continental France.

Regulatory Authorities

Following government reforms begun in 2012, the telecommunications
sector came under the responsibility of a number of different institutions
in 2013:

= until the new authorities took over in October 2013, the sector was
overseen by the secretariat of state for telecommunications and the
information society (Secretaria de Estado de Telecomunicaciones
y para la Sociedad de la Informacion — SETS), the Telecommunications
Market Commission (Comision del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones
— CMT) and the National Competition Commission (Comisién
Nacional de la Competencia — CNC), charged with enforcing
competition law in coordination with the sector authorities;

since October 2018, the regulators for all the various sectors of the
economy, including telecommunications, have been brought
together under a new cross-industry entity, the National
Commission for Markets and Competition (Comisién Nacional de
los Mercados y la Competencia), set up by law No. 3/2013 of
June 4, 2013, which also has responsibility for competition issues.

As a result the telecom industry is now overseen by both the new
multi-industry regulator and Setsi as follows:

= Setsi handles authorizations, spectrum attributions, telephone
numbering, universal service cost approvals, service quality, and
disputes between consumers and non-dominant operators;

= the National Commission for Markets and Competition (Comisién
Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia — CNMC), conducts
market analysis and handles disputes involving operators with
significant market power.

Following a consultation in December 2011 on the wholesale mobile call termination market (market 7), the CMT issued a decision on May 10, 2012
proposing a gradual decrease of mobile call termination caps, reaching rate symmetry in July 2013. The proposed caps are as follows:

Spectrum

In May 2011, the Spanish authorities allocated a 5 MHz duplex block in the 900 MHz spectrum to Orange Spain. The license, granted under

the principle of technological neutrality, is valid until December 2030.

In July 2011, the Spanish authorities auctioned the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 2.6 GHz frequency bands. The 800 MHz licenses, awarded in
2011, only become available from 2015. The same is true for the 900 MHz block allotted to Telefonica.

In July 2013, Orange Spain’s license for the 900 MHz band was extended from 2025 to 2030 and its 1,800 MHz license from 2023 to 2030.

Following these allocations, the Spanish spectrum is distributed as follows (national licenses):

On September 24, 2014 the government approved by Royal Decree
805/2014 the technical specifications that would allow the handover
of digital TV spectrum in the 800 MHz band to mobile telephony use
on January 1, 2015. These licenses were awarded following the 2011
auction process to three operators: Telefonica Moviles, Vodafone and
Orange.

However, at the request of the digital TV operators who needed to
adapt their existing antennae, on December 26, 2014, the Minister
for Industry delayed the handover date of January 1, 2015 by three
months. The mobile operators were given a compensating three-
month extension to their licenses.

The Minister for Industry also issued a draft order making the telecoms
operators alone responsible for dealing with any interference (and
underlying costs) in the adjacent 470-790 MHz DTTV band. On

December 11, 2014 the CNMC announced that it would oversee the
smooth fulfillment of these obligations and put in place measures to
prevent interference. It is proposing a monitoring system backed up
by penalties for non-compliant operators.

Following a query from the Spanish association of new mobile
operators (AENOM), on October 30, 2014 the CNMC confirmed that
he regulatory obligations on the call origination and termination
market would also apply to 4G.

2014, for 13 regional licenses, 2*10 MHz TDD local licenses and 3°10
MHz FDD regional licenses, the Ministry for Industry, Energy and
Tourism allocated the 10*10 MHz lots for local and regional licenses
by Ministerial Order published in the Spanish Official Journal BOE-A-
2014-7942 of July 25, 2014.

2.2.3.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and superfast broadband Internet

Universal Service

The law on a sustainable economy approved in February 2011 stipulates that functional access to the Internet includes a 1 MB broadband
connection. The new method for calculating the universal service cost was approved in December 2012 and includes broadband connections.
Telefonica was again designated as the universal service provider beginning in January 2012.

The universal service net cost from 2006 to 2010 and Orange's contribution are given in the following table:

Wholesale broadband markets (markets 4 and 5/2007)

The CMT issued a decision on the wholesale broadband market in
January 2009 that covers offers under 30 Mbps. A new round of
analysis for this market began in 2013 and is currently open for
consultation.

Following the consultation launched in February 2013 on unbundling
and bitstream rates, and having taken account of comments by the
European Commission and the BEREC, in September the CMT
increased the full unbundling monthly rate from 8.32 euros to
8.60 euros and cut the partial unbundling tariff from 2.06 euros to
1.30 euros.

As regards bitstream rates, the CMT introduced provisional tariffs for
new bitstream (NEBA) offers in July 2012, including a bitstream for
fiber offer, which will eventually replace current technologies (GigADSL
and ADSL-IP). These rates include an increased risk premium for
wholesale superfast broadband offers.

In February 2018, the CMT proposed a new set of bitstream rates
which the European Commission failed to approve. In June 2013, the
Commission launched a phase II investigation and expressed serious
doubts about these new offers, which were priced 50% above cost.
At end-October 2013, at the conclusion of this procedure, the
European Commission officially asked the CNMC to withdraw or
amend its proposals to comply with cost-based pricing.

On January 30, 2014, the CNMC finally authorized the reference offer with the following definitive rates:

On April 1, 2014 the CNMC declared that its wholesale offer for
broadband access NEBA would be open to all operators, replacing
the GigADSL and ADSL IP offers, which will cease to be regulated in
areas of Spain where NEBA is available.

Market analysis - 3 round

The CNMC put out for consultation on December 19, 2014 its third
round of analysis of the 3a and 3b/2014 and 4/2014 markets, which
proposes:

3 a market:

= to retain the copper network unbundling obligations introduced in
he previous 2009 analysis and to retain access to Telefonica civil
engineering infrastructure;

= to lift part of the obligations for ex ante regulation of the fiber
network in nine towns, home to 16% of the Spanish population,
and to use virtual unbundled local access (VULA) for the rest of Spain;

= to open up access to the vertical part of the fiber optic network in
buildings at cost-based rates.

3 b market:

= to remove the obligation for ex ante regulation of copper networks
in parts of Spain declared to be competitive (i.e. those containing 58%
of currently installed broadband lines), after a one-year grace period
to implement the decision and to offer NEBA fiber optic access;

= elsewhere in Spain, to retain Telefonica’s network access obligations,
with a NEBA over copper offer with no speed cap charged on a
cost-based basis, and a NEBA fiber optic offer that meets the
economic replicability test.

market 4:

= to retain throughout Spain the obligation to provide a NEBA
business offer at a “reasonable” price, to be defined.

Fixed-line call termination rates (market 1/2014)

On September 23, 2014 the CNMC adopted its decision on the
38° round of market analysis for fixed line call termination
(ANME/DTSA/628/14/M3-3°RONDA). The decision creates a
symmetrical market for call termination at a rate of 0.0817 euro
cents/minute, in accordance with the methodology recommended by
the European Commission and imposes a new obligation to offer IP
interconnection.

Orange and Vodafone agreement to roll out fiber optic in Spain

n March 2013, Orange and Vodafone agreed to roll out fiber optic in
more than 50 towns by 2016, covering around 40% of the Spanish
population.

Under the agreement, which is open to any other operator wishing to
co-invest, the vertical infrastructure will be shared pro rata of costs
incurred. Orange and Vodafone have opened a dispute resolution
procedure before the regulator seeking to change the access
conditions for the terminating segment of the fiber optic cable
belonging to Telefonica. The CNMC has accepted this and has
effectively, in its notice CONF/DTSA/328/14 of October 16, 2014,
extended the terms of the reciprocal commercial agreements between
Jazztel and Telefonica to Orange and Vodafone.

New framework law on telecommunications

The new framework law on telecommunications came into force on

Orange Polska’s businesses are governed by the law of July 16, 2004
on telecommunications, transposing the 2002 European Telecom
Package concerning electronic communications into Polish law, and
by the law of February 16, 2007 concerning competition and consumer

to intervene in regional or local regulations that block infrastructure
sharing projects.

In addition, telecommunications operators get a right to use passive
infrastructure owned by utilities, rail companies and motorways on
commercial terms.

Decommissioning of the copper network

The CNMC approved the first requests of Telefonica to decommission
two distribution frames in its copper networks. The distribution frames
in question are small exchanges with no unbundling or equipment
collocation. Under the terms of the CNMC/CMT decision on analysis
of wholesale network infrastructure, market 4/2007, issued in 2009,
Telefonica is obliged to continue offering the option of unbundling for
five years after filing a request to decommission an exchange with the
CNMC. This period falls to just one year if there are no unbundled
operators.

Orange’s bid for Jazztel

On September 15, 2014 Orange announced it was launching a takeover
bid for carrier Jazztel. This requires approval from, notably, the European
Commission. If approved, the bid would make Orange the second-
biggest operator in the Spanish markets for broadband and convergence
offers (See Section 4.4 Recent events).

The applicable framework concerning personal data protection is
defined by the law of August 29, 1997 concerning personal data
protection, as amended in 2002. The 2004 Telecommunications Act
also defines certain rules applicable to personal data protection and
storage").

Regulatory Authorities

The Ministry of Administration and Digitization, created in
November 2011, is responsible for telecommunications.

allocated in summer 2015.

At stake are five 5 MHz duplex blocks in the 800 MHz spectrum and
fourteen 5 MHz duplex blocks in the 2.6 GHz spectrum. All licenses
will run for 15 years. There is no spectrum block reserved for a new
entrant.

However, a sixth block of 2*5 MHz in the 800 MHz band has been
reserved for Sferia.

2.2.4.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and superfast broadband Internet

Fixed-line call termination rates

Since the UKE’s decision of September 22, 2009, following its second round of market analysis, call termination rates must be based on cost,

with no further details given.

The UKE reserves the right, however, to control rates by benchmarking or a retail minus formula and has indicated it intends to move towards

symmetry in 2014.

The UKE is proposing the following changes to asymmetry levels:

Level Jan. July Jan. July
of asymmetry 2009 2009 2010 2010
Simple transit 92% 82% 73% 64%
Double transit 9% 8% 7% 6%

5% 4% 3% 3% 2% 1% 0%

These asymmetry levels are used as benchmarks in the event of dispute resolution procedures.

For an efficient generic operator on a New Generation Network (NGN), the European Commission recommendation of May 7, 2009 requires
National Regulatory Authorities to set the fixed-line call termination rates based on long-run incremental costs only. The UKE is preparing a

draft decision applying this recommendation.
Universal Service

Expiry of Orange Polska’s universal service obligation:

In 2006, the UKE imposed universal service obligations on Orange
Polska until May 9, 2011. Since then, the UKE has taken no further
steps to appoint a new universal service provider. On May 5, 2014,
the UKE published a report that did away with universal service
obligations in Poland.

For the whole period when it was responsible for universal service
(November 2006 to May 2011), Orange Polska estimated its cost
amounted to 1.1 billion zlotys while only 137 million zlotys were
allotted in compensation by the UKE. Orange Polska has therefore
appealed to have the UKE decisions reexamined.

In March 2014, the UKE designated which operators would bear the
cost of providing a universal service in 2006. Other decisions should
follow for the years 2007-2011.

The UKE consulted until November 2014 on the potential reference
offer for non-discriminatory wholesale access to regional broadband
networks. The regional broadband networks are cofinanced by the
European Regional Development Fund and the Polish government.
The UKE is proposing to impose a non-discriminatory wholesale

decision excludes 76 Polish towns, covering 24% of the population,
from ex ante regulation and excuses Orange Polska from all regulatory
obligations in respect of these towns. In these deregulated areas,
Orange Polska will offer wholesale offers on a commercial basis.
Everywhere else, the obligations imposed on Orange Polska are
maintained (on access, non-discrimination, transparency, accounting
separation and cost orientation).

A decision on the 2 GHz band is expected in 2015.

Cable wholesale broadband markets

The regulatory framework for access to the cable operators’ networks
is governed by two decisions of the Belgian conference of electronic
communications sector regulators (CRC) of July 1, 2011 and
December 11, 2013. Under this framework, cable operators have to
provide wholesale access offers to their network priced on a retail
minus model.

2.3 Orange’s group strategy

Orange presented by early 2015 its new strategic plan to 2020, called
Essentials2020 building on the Conquests 2075 plan launched in
2010.

The Group can count upon a series of key strengths and has a clear
mission: to always be on hand to connect people to what is essential
to them. Orange serves every kind of customer, from those who focus
above all else on price through to those who have a particularly high-
level of service expectation, as well as business customers of every
type, from SOHOs to multinationals.

Orange has set itself a strong, demanding and unique ambition for
this strategic plan: to provide each of its customers, wherever they
are, an incomparable service experience.

To serve this ambition, the Group will leverage five main drivers:

offering richer connectivity;

reinventing the customer relationship;

building a people-oriented and digital employer model;
accompanying the transformation of enterprise customers;
diversifying by capitalizing on its assets.

aRWON >

The strategic plan will be achieved within the framework of a company
that is efficient, responsible and digitally proficient.

The ambition and each of the Orange main drivers will result in
operational and financial objectives.

1. Offering richer connectivity

Firstly Orange intends to offer richer connectivity in each of the
markets in which the Group is active. To maintain its position as a
high-speed broadband leader, Orange will invest more than 15
billion euros in its networks from 2015 to 2018.

Orange aims to triple average data speeds compared to 2014 on both
fixed and mobile networks by the end of 2018.

Prioritizing investments based on their impact
on the customer experience

Orange will prioritize capital expenditure on the network where
customers need it most.

To optimise the allocation of resources, Orange will deploy a Customer
Experience Management tool — CEM. Similarly, the “My Network”
application will allow each customer, as required, to be actively
involved in the improvement of his or her quality of service by reporting
any issues as they are encountered.

Expanding high-capacity fixed service

n France, Orange will triple its investments in fibre by 2020 and
increase the number of connected homes from 3.6 million at the end
of 2014 to 12 million in 2018 and to 20 million in 2022.

n Spain, the Group will continue to expand its fiber network and its
TV offering with the aim of doubling convergent revenues by 2018.
The proposal to acquire Jazztel, which is currently being examined by
he European Commission, will enable the Group to reinforce and
accelerate this strategy that aims to reach 10 million connectable
homes by the end of 2016.

n Poland, Orange started 2015 with an ambitious plan to deploy its
own fiber network that aims to reinforce its position as the incumbent
operator and market leader in terms of fixed line access and
convergence.

n Belgium, a market characterized by strong cable coverage, Orange
will test the use of this technology through the launch of a TV offering
in 2015 that will be significantly different from existing market offerings.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Orange’s group strategy

Expanding high-capacity mobile service

n Europe, the ambition is to have more than 95% 4G coverage across
he Group’s footprint in 2018.

n France, Orange will launch Voice over WiFi in 2015, with immediate
benefits to the customer in terms of indoor coverage. Orange will also
launch the ma ville sans coupure project, which aims to virtually
eliminate dropped calls in urban areas, and will deploy an ambitious
program focused on improving coverage along major transport routes.

n Africa and the Middle East, Orange will continue to invest
significantly in territorial coverage, with a particular emphasis on the
continued deployment broadband networks. 4G will be launched in
seven countries in 2015 and in the majority of countries in that region
by 2018. At the same time, the Group will continue to offer affordable
smartphones that are customized within the Orange environment.

Continuing network modernization

To develop a cutting-edge network armed with the necessary flexibility
and agility that will allow it to respond rapidly to customers’ needs,
the Group will drive the evolution of its network towards all-IP, the
Cloud and the virtualization of network functions, as well as preparing
for the introduction of 5G.

A richer content experience

The Group will build on the quality of its networks, particularly in very
high-speed broadband, to develop uses and deliver what the
customer wants by offering a multiscreen experience with richer
content. This is already the case with the Group’s new TV interface,
Polaris.

Thanks to the TV stick, which was recently launched in Romania and
will soon be introduced to the French market - Orange customers
can access Orange TV and related content at home simply by
connecting the HDMI stick to their television sets.

2. Reinventing the customer
relationship

To reinvent the customer relationship, Orange will approach all of its
operations from the perspective of customer uses and experience, by
anticipating their desires and responding to them in a personalized,
targeted and effective manner.

Simplifying customer interactions with a more
personalized approach

Orange will pay special attention to all the key moments in its
interactions with customers. A single Orange customer service
number will be introduced in France in 2016.

Big Data is an essential tool for achieving this; by gaining a better
knowledge of customers, the Group will be able to propose offers and
services that are as close as possible to what they want. Each
customer will be recognized at every interaction with Orange, and the
Orange contact will have immediate access to the entire history of the
customer’s relationship with Orange.

The digitalization of the customer relationship

Orange aims to pursue the digitalization of its interactions with
customers by building on the complementarity between physical and
digital channels to provide a unified customer experience. The
objective is for half of all customer interactions across Europe to be
through digital channels by 2018.

Rethinking sales areas

Orange wants to turn its shops into concept stores that offer an
inviting and original experience, organized by theme: home, family,
work, wellbeing, entertainment. By 2018, 20% of Orange’s shops will

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

be Smart Stores in France and in Europe. Among these, certain stores
will be even more sophisticated: the megastores will have dedicated
spaces for testing products and services or trying out the latest
innovations; a customer will also be able to benefit from personalized
advice tailored to his or her specific needs. Orange will open 40 of
these megastores in France by 2018.

The First services

Orange is a universal brand. It is for everyone, but with services
adapted to each individual. However, some customers are prepared
to attribute value to a superior level of service, such as for example a
premium service for the installation of equipment in their homes or a
privileged access to digital experts. For these customers, Orange will
launch its First service in France and Europe in 2016, and in a first
African country, Senegal.

3. Building a people-oriented
and digital employer model

Orange wants to be a company to which all employees are proud to
belong. The Group wants to establish itself as a people-focused,
digital employer that is anchored in a high-quality employee
experience, the starting point for a successful Orange customer
experience. The goal is for 9 out of 10 employees to recommend
Orange as an employer by the end of the plan.

Securing the skills needed for tomorrow

Orange will identify and develop the skills it needs for the deployment
of its strategy, in particular in new digital areas. Orange will build on
high-quality digital training programs and aims to reach a level where
in 2018 half of all training will be given via a digital training platform
(digital learning, MOOC, serious gaming).

Developing collective agility

New, more agile and more collaborative ways of working will be
introduced, which will also contribute to the quality of working life.
Special attention will be paid to the tools provided to employees who
are in contact with customers.

Fostering individual commitment

To increase employee commitment and participation in the life of the
company, Orange will reinforce its management culture by
strengthening the level of confidence and responsibility with the aim
of giving employees additional means and more autonomy in front of
customers. Orange will also promote employee share-holding with
the aim of reaching 10% employee ownership going forward.

4. Accompanying the transformation
of enterprise customers

The digital revolution is transforming the lives of businesses. Orange’s

role is to be the trusted partner for companies’ digital transformation.

Orange Business Services will evolve to adapt to the increasing
demand for integrated IT and connectivity services.

Orange’s objective is to increase the share of IT services in the Orange
Business Services revenue mix by 10 percentage points by 2020.

Orange will focus on four key areas, in addition to connectivity:

= developing mobile, flexible and collaborative work tools;

= the improvement of sectorial processes, particularly related to
connected objects and applications ;

= the private and hybrid Cloud for multinationals ;

= cyber-defence.
5. Diversifying by capitalising
on its assets

Orange has decided to concentrate on two fields in which it has
legitimacy and where it can capitalize on its assets. These activities
will represent part of the Group’s future sources of growth.

The Group has set an ambitious objective for these new disciplines:
surpassing the billion-euro revenue mark in 2018.

Connected objects

The “Internet of Things” will open up a number of business and
positioning opportunities.

The Group wants to be present across the entire value chain, by
object type:

= the distribution of connected objects;

= the supply of services that add value to those objects, particularly
in the health and wellbeing field or in the connected home field ;

= the management of data related to connected objects through an
open intermediation platform.

With more than 10,000 customers, the success of the Homelive offer
in France provides encouragement for the Group to continue in this
direction and to expand its services further in its different European
markets from 2015 onwards.

Mobile financial services

Orange Money in Africa, and more recently Orange Finanse in Poland,
confirm the Group’s legitimacy in this business.

Financial services cover three distinct worlds:
= in Africa and the Middle East:

— Orange Money, a transfers and payments service, is already a
huge success with 13 million users today and an objective to
reach 30 million users by 2018;

= in Europe:

— the payment area where Orange is already active with Orange
Cash and NFC technology,

— the Mobile banking area which offers significant growth
prospects and is where the Group will concentrate its efforts.
Orange aims to launch an expanded mobile banking service in
its three largest European markets. In addition to the Orange
Finanse offer that has already been launched in Poland, the
Group will also launch services in France and Spain by 2018.

Open innovation

To support these new services, Orange continues to innovate
leveraging its own resources and by following an Open Innovation
approach. The Group’s ambition is to have supported 500 start-ups
worldwide by 2020 through its different programs (Corporate
Ventures, Orange Fab through an operational approach aimed at the
rapid development of commercial, and sometimes capitalistic,
partnerships.

A digital, efficient
and responsible company

Orange is positioning itself as a dynamic company that is efficient,
responsible and digitally proficient. The Group has integrated digital
tools such as Big Data, the Cloud and open APIs into both internal
and external processes. It will also pursue its operational efficiency

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Orange’s group strategy

program, Chrysalid, with an objective to reach an additional 3
billion euros of gross savings, the same level of ambition in 2015-2018
as in the 2011-2014 period. In parallel, Orange will continue to operate
within the framework of a strong ethical policy that accounts for
changing social and environmental factors.

Ambitions and financial objectives

Orange’s strategy, both for its core activities as well as new growth
areas, aims to generate new growth while maintaining a healthy
financial situation.

Concerning operations, the Group will track several major indicators
to assess the implementation of the Essentials2020 plan:

The first two indicators are global indicators that reflect the core
ambition of Essentials2020 concerning customers’ digital experience:

= first a leadership indicator in terms of customer recommendations,
as evidenced by the Net Promoter Score or NPS. This commonly
used metric encompasses all of the plan’s drivers. Orange wants
oO become number 1 in NPS for three out of four customers by
2018, and to remain so;

= then an indicator that measures the power of the Orange brand:
he Brand Power Index. Orange is aiming for continuous
improvement in this indicator across its markets by 2018 through
he new brand identity and especially as a result of the proof we
will provide customers concerning their improved digital experience.

Beyond this, Orange has one ambition per driver:

= for the first driver on richer connectivity, Orange has set an ambitious
objective of tripling the average data speeds of its customers on its
ixed and mobile networks by 2018 compared to 2014;

= forthe second driver on the customer relationship, Orange is aiming
‘or 50% digitization of interactions with its customers by 2018,
versus just over 30% today;

= for the third driver on the people-oriented digital employer model,
Orange has chosen an indicator identical to that chosen for its
customers, based on recommendation. Orange is aiming for 9
employees out of 10 to recommend Orange as an employer by
2018;

for the fourth driver on the Enterprise market, Orange has chosen
to measure the success of the transformation of its Enterprise
business model towards IT services. The Group aims to raise the
share of IT services in the Orange Business Services revenue mix
by 10 points by 2020;

for the last driver, the selected indicator will measure the success
of diversification into new services, with connected objects and
mobile finance services. The objective is for these new services to
contribute more than one billion euros to the Group’s revenues in
2018.

On the financial side, the objectives for the Group are as follows:
= 2018 revenues will be higher than 2014 revenues;

= restated EBITDA in 2018 will be higher than restated EBITDA in
2014, with a low point in 2015 of between 11.9 and 12.1 billion euros;

= the Group will maintain a healthy financial balance sheet, with a
restated net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2x over the medium term;

= Concerning the dividend, the Group will maintain a minimum of
60 euro-cents per year over the period 2015-2018, without
excluding the possibility of an increase depending on restated
EBITDA performance.

2.4 Risk factors

In addition to the information contained in the present Registration
Document, investors should carefully consider the risks outlined below
before deciding whether to invest. The Company’s view at the date
of this Registration Document is that these risks could have a negative
impact on the business, financial position or profits of Orange and/or
its subsidiaries. In addition, other risks and uncertainties, as yet
unidentified or currently considered to be immaterial, could have
similar negative impacts and investors could lose all or part of their
investment.

The risks described in this Chapter concern:

= risks relating to Orange’s business activities (see Section 2.4.1);
= risks of a legal nature (see Section 2.4.2);

= financial risks (see Section 2.4.3).

In each section, risk factors are presented in diminishing order of
importance, as determined by the Company at the date of filing the
current Registration Document. Orange may change its view of their
relative importance at any time, particularly if new external or internal
facts come to light.

Several other sections of this Registration Document also discuss
risks in some detail:

= for risks related to Orange’s general strategy, see Section 2.3
Orange’s group strategy;

= for risks relating to regulations and regulatory pressure, see Section
2.2 Regulations and Note 15 Litigation to the consolidated financial
statements (Section 4.1);

2.4.1. Operational risks

Risks related to strategy
and the economic environment

1. The rapid growth in broadband use (fixed or mobile) allows
global players of the Internet sector the opportunity to establish
a direct link with telecommunications operators’ customers,
thus depriving the latter, including Orange, of a share of their
revenues and margins. If this phenomenon continues or
intensifies, it could seriously impair the financial position and
outlook of the operators.

The increased use of networks for value-added services has led to
he emergence of new powerful players, the Over The Top providers
(OTT). Competition with these players to control customer relations is
growing and could erode the operators’ market position. This direct
relationship with customers is a source of value for operators and to
lose part or all of it to new entrants could affect revenues, margins,
he financial position and outlook of telecommunications operators
ike Orange.

n response, Orange has adopted a strategy aimed at making
significant investments to increase the capacity of its transport and
aggregation networks and to set itself apart based on the quality of
he high-capacity broadband service offered; and supplying more
innovative and attractive communication services.

There is however no guarantee that this strategy, and particularly the
investments made in the field of innovation, will be sufficient in the
ace of the pressure from new entrants. With no assurance of
profitability on these investments, the financial position and outlook
of Orange could be affected.

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

= for risks relating to litigation involving the Group, see Note 15
Litigation to the consolidated financial statements as well as Section
4.4 Recent events;

= for risks relating to the vulnerability of the technical infrastructure
and environmental risks, see Section 5.6.2 Environmental information;

= for financial risks, see:

— Notes 6, 7 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements on
asset impairments,

— Note 10.7 to the consolidated financial statements on derivatives
instruments,

— Note 11 Information on market risks and fair value of financial
assets and liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for
the management of interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk,
covenants, credit risk and counterparty risk and equity market risk.

The guidelines for managing interest rate, foreign exchange and
liquidity risks are set by the Treasury and Financing Committee. See
Section 5.2.3.3 Executive Committee and Group governance
committees:

= for the insurance plan, see Section 5.4.6 Insurance;

= more generally, risk management policies throughout the Orange
Group are discussed in the Chairman’s Report on governance and
internal control. See Section 5.4 Risk management.

2. Orange generates much of its revenues from mature countries
and business activities where intense competition in the
telecommunications sector could erode its profitability or its
market share.

The main markets in which Orange operates are mature or even
saturated. Orange therefore faces extremely tough competition. Up
until now, competition mostly focused on prices but the pressure is
now also placed on the ability of operators to offer convergence offers
(fixed-line, mobile and high-capacity broadband). In response, Orange
chose to make significant investments and continue to conduct a
transformation and fixed cost reduction policy.

Facing the rising tide of bundled packages (notably put to market by
the group resulting from the merger between Numéricable and SFR),
if Orange was not able to deploy this strategy, the Company could
lose market share and/or be forced to reduce its margins. Consequently,
the Group’s financial position and results could be impaired.

For more information on competition, see Chapter 3 Overview of the
Group’s business.

3. Orange is relying on sources of growth in emerging markets
in which the Company has invested. Investments already
made may fail to bring the expected returns, and may even
generate unexpected commitments and the Group could be
faced with increased country risk. The Group’s results and
outlook could be impaired.

The Group’s growth partly depends on its activities in fast-growing
regions of the world. Orange has thus invested in telecommunications
companies located in the Middle East and in Africa. Political instability
or changes in the economic, legal or social landscape in these regions
may call into question the outlook on profits held when these
investments were made. International economic sanctions imposed
on these countries could also have an impact on the value of these
investments.

Moreover, these regions could present difficulties or specific risks in
relation to internal controls or failure to comply with the applicable
laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws (regulations that
could also present risks in other regions where the Company operates,
in particular due to its increased scope and restricting nature).

If the expected growth in revenues from these territories was not
achieved or if Orange was not able to render them profitable, the
Group’s financial position and results could be impaired.

4. The deteriorated state of the economy in France and in
Europe could translate into a squeeze on consumption and
have a significant impact on Orange’s business and results.

Risks that the economy will stagnate or deteriorate remain high,
notably in France. Governments have responded with economic and
fiscal policies designed to cut debt and rebalance the budget. This
could translate directly into a squeeze on household consumption and
business activity, which could in turn significantly affect Orange’s
revenues and profits.

For further information on the impact of the economic situation on the
Orange Group, see also financial risks in Section 2.4.3 below.

Risks related to the sector

5. Technical failures or the saturation of the telecommunications
networks, the technical infrastructures or IT system could
reduce traffic, erode revenues and damage the reputation of
the operators or the sector as a whole.

There has already been damage to or interruptions to the service
provided to customers and these may reoccur following outages
(hardware or software), human errors or sabotage of critical hardware
or software, cyber-attacks, failure or refusal of a critical supplier, or if
the network in question does not have sufficient capacity to meet the
growing usage needs, or during the implementation of new applications
or software.

As a result of the rationalization of the network based on the
implementation of all-IP technologies, the increase in the size of the
service platforms and the relocation of equipment into fewer buildings,
such service interruptions may in the future affect a greater number
of customers and more than one country simultaneously.

Although impossible to quantify, the impact of such interruptions
affecting one or several countries would not only cause customer
dissatisfaction, reduced traffic and an adverse effect on Orange
revenues, but could also lead to intervention from the public
authorities in the country or countries concerned.

6. Orange may be held liable for the loss, release, disclosure to
third parties or inappropriate modification of customer data.
Its liability may also be triggered or its reputation damaged
by its Internet access and hosting services.

Orange's activities may trigger the loss, release, disclosure to third
parties or inappropriate modification of the data of its customers or
the general public, particularly their banking details, which are stored
on its infrastructures or carried by its networks.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

These losses could arise from the accelerated implementation of new
services or new applications, for example those relating to billing and
customer relationship management, from malicious acts (particularly
he theft of customer personal data) or negligence.

Moreover, Orange may in some countries be obliged to disclose
personal data to third parties under legal regimes that fail to offer the
same protection as France, which could damage the Company’s
reputation and image.

Recourse to liability proceedings is facilitated in a number of countries
by legislation increasing operators’ obligations, and it could become
even easier in the future should the legislation become more stringent
due to the pressure of certain professional organizations.

Such incidents could have a considerable impact on the Group’s
reputation and a high impact on its liability, including its criminal liability.

7. The technical infrastructure belonging to telecommunications
operators are vulnerable to damage or interruptions caused
by natural disasters, fires, wars, acts of terrorism, intentional
damage, malicious acts, or other similar events.

A natural disaster or other unforeseen incidents affecting Orange’s
installations could cause significant damage generating high repair
costs. In most cases, Orange has no insurance for damage to its aerial
lines and must assume the full cost of the repairs itself. Furthermore,
the damage caused by such major disasters may have more long-
term consequences resulting in significant expense for Orange and
which would harm its image. Moreover, international, European and
national laws now recognize the existence of climate change. Weather
phenomena associated with this climate change may increase the
seriousness of disasters and of the damage caused.

8. The scope of Orange activities and the interconnection of the
networks mean that the Group is highly exposed to the risk
of fraud, which could reduce revenues and margins and
damage its image.

As all operators, Orange is subject to various fraud issues which can
affect the Company or its customers. Moreover, with technologies and
networks becoming increasingly more complex and the accelerated
implementation of new services or new applications relating notably
to billing and customer relationship management, new types of fraud
which are more difficult to detect or combat could also develop.
Orange’s revenues, margins, service quality and reputation could be
affected.

9. Exposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunications
equipment raises concerns for possible health adverse effects.
Perceptions of this risk could worsen or a deleterious effect
may one day be scientifically established, which would have
negative consequences for the business and results of operators
such as Orange.

In many countries, concerns have been raised regarding the possible
health risks linked to exposure to electromagnetic fields from
telecommunications equipment (primarily mobile handsets, cell phone
antennae, WiFi). Although the health authorities have until now found
no health risks below the limits recommended by the specialist
international committee (ICNIRP), a finding that was reiterated in
March 2015 by the European health authorities (GCENIHR), Orange
cannot predict the conclusions of future scientific research or studies
by international organizations and scientific committees called upon
to examine these issues. In the absence of scientific certainty,
governments have introduced strict regulations and health authorities
have issued various precautionary measures.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

The regulatory and case law developments could lead to a reduction
in coverage zones, deterioration of the service quality and customer
dissatisfaction, as well as a slowdown in the roll-out of cell phone
antennae and an increase in the costs of network roll-outs, which
could have a significant impact on the Orange brand and the Group’s
results and financial position. In addition, tougher regulations and case
law cannot be ruled out in the future, as shown by the adoption, on
February 9, 2015 of the French law on simplicity, transparency,
information and consultation regarding exposure to electromagnetic
fields. Besides, in certain cases, jurisdictions have ordered telephone
operators to take down cell phone antennae and to compensate local
residents. Moreover, future scientific studies or their various assessments
or interpretations could lead to a decrease in the use of mobile
telecommunication services, difficulties and additional costs in the roll-
out of cell phone antennae and wireless networks, as well as an
increased number of lawsuits, particularly if a health risk was eventually
scientifically established. The perception of risks by the public or
employees could also lead to a decrease in the number of customers
and lower consumption by customers, as well as an increase in
lawsuits or other consequences including, in particular, opposition to
the construction of or even the existence of cell phone antennae.

For further information, see Section 5.6.3.7 Health and Safety of
customers.

Risks relating to human resources

10. If Orange does not manage to be sufficiently attractive
compared to its competitors, to recruit in all countries when
needed the qualified employees that will allow to develop its
business, foster knowledge and ensure a sufficient continuity
for ongoing projects within the Group, Orange’s business
activities and operating results could be materially affected.

Wherever the Company operates, Orange is exposed to risks related
to its ability to attract or retain qualified employees in strategic business
lines and conduct an ongoing skills renewal in core business lines. In

2.4.2 Legal risks

12. Orange operates in highly regulated markets, where its
flexibility to manage its business is limited. Orange’s business
activities and results could be materially affected by legislative,
regulatory or government policy changes.

In most countries in which it operates, Orange must comply with
various regulatory obligations governing the provision of its products
and services, primarily relating to obtaining and renewing licenses, as
well as to oversight by authorities seeking to maintain effective
competition in the electronic communications markets. Furthermore,
in certain countries Orange faces regulatory constraints as a result of
its historically dominant position in the fixed-line telecommunications
market, in particular in France and Poland.

Orange’s business activities and operating income may be materially
adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or government policy
changes, and in particular by decisions taken by regulatory or
competition authorities in connection with:

= amendment or renewal on unfavorable conditions, or even
withdrawal of fixed-line or mobile operator licenses;

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

France, the increase in retirements heightens the risk of lacking qualified
employees locally in certain business lines.

Orange’s success partially depends on its capacity to attract, wherever
the Company has presence and particularly in France at the moment,
highly qualified employees, and to retain and motivate its key talents.

11. In 2009, Orange was faced with a major workforce crisis in
France. Since 2010, the Group has implemented an ambitious
human resources program to respond to this crisis. However,
the economic context could hinder the implementation of this
program and thus have a material impact on the Group’s
image, operations, and results.

n 2008 and 2009, the Group was faced with a major crisis relating to
psycho-social risks and anxiety at work, the effects of which
continued into 2010. This crisis received widespread coverage in the
French and international media following a number of employee
suicides and had a major impact on the Group’s image. Orange is
also subject to criminal proceedings. In response to this crisis, the
Group pledged its commitment to a new social contract in 2010, and
he Orange People Charte project rolled out across the Group in 2011.
The aim of these projects was to define the Company’s professional
practices and management culture and apply sustainable solutions
oO identified risk factors, such as the implementation of practical
measures drawn up in group discussion sessions, the organization of
restructuring conferences, the signing of several agreements with
representative unions, and the roll-out of an employee satisfaction
survey.

Although the Group believes that the cost of implementing such
projects should be more than offset for by the benefits to the
Company and its employees, this project could however come into
conflict with certain cost-cutting plans. Moreover, in the event that the
project does not achieve the expected results over the long-term, the
crisis may re-emerge, affecting the Group’s image, its operations and
its results.

= conditions governing network access (primarily those in connection
with roaming or infrastructure sharing);

= service rates;

= the introduction of new taxes or increases to existing taxes for
telecommunications companies;

= consumerism legislation;

= the European Commission Digital Agenda and the Connected
Continent project, and in particular net neutrality (see Section 2.2
Regulations);

= merger policy;

= regulations affecting operators of competing sectors, such as cable;
= regulations governing data security.

Such decisions could materially affect the Group’s revenues and results.

For further information on risks related to regulations, see Section 2.2
Regulations.
13. Orange is continually involved in legal proceedings and
disputes with regulatory authorities, competitors, or other
parties. The outcome of such proceedings is generally
uncertain and could have a material impact on its results or
financial position.

Orange believes that, on a general basis and in all countries in which
it is present, it complies with all the specific regulations in force, as
well the conditions governing its operator licenses. However, the
Company is not able to predict the decisions of oversight and legal
authorities who are regularly asked to rule on such issues. Should
Orange be ordered to pay damages or a fine due to the non-respect
of a given regulation in force by the relevant authorities in a country in
which it is present, the Group’s financial position and results could be
adversely affected.

n addition, Orange — particularly in France and Poland — is frequently
involved in legal proceedings with its competitors and with the
regulatory authorities due to its preeminent position in certain markets
and the complaints filed against Orange may be very substantial.
During the past, fines of several tens of millions of euros were imposed
on the Group for abuse of a dominant position and on one occasion,
a fine of several hundreds of millions of euros for concerted practices.
Finally, the Group may be the object of substantial commercial
lawsuits, worth tens of millions of euros, such as the one that gave
rise to an amicable settlement between its Polish subsidiary (Orange
Polska) and Danish company DPTG in January 2012 where Orange
Polska paid compensation amounting to 550 million euros. The
outcome of lawsuits is inherently unpredictable.

nthe case of proceedings involving European competition authorities,
he maximum fine provided for by law is 10% of the consolidated
revenues of the company at fault (or the group to which it belongs, as
he case may be).

The main proceedings involving Orange are detailed in Note 15
Litigation to the consolidated financial statements as well as Section

2.4.3 Financial risks

Liquidity risk
16. Orange’s results and outlook could be affected if the terms
of access to capital markets become difficult.

Orange raises most of its finance from capital markets (particularly the
bond market), which are heavily influenced by the evolution of the
economic environment. For instance, a rise in government debt could
revive the crisis of confidence in sovereign debt, which could contaminate
he corporate bond market, making it harder for Orange to raise
inancing and/or significantly increasing the interest rate charged on
its borrowings.

There are still concerns regarding the consequences of new regulations
Basel Ill and Solvency Il, which look to strengthen the equity of banks’
and insurance companies respectively. Banks are reducing their
outstanding loans forcing companies to increase funding obtained on
bond markets, which is Orange’s main source of financing. The
ightening of prudential rules in the finance sector could reduce
companies’ access to financing or refinancing from the bond market
or bank loans necessary for their business even for first-rate borrowers
or issuers such as Orange. Any inability to access the markets and/or
obtain financing on reasonable terms could have a material adverse
effect on Orange. The Group could, in particular, be required to allocate
a significant portion of its available cash to pay off debt, to the detriment

4.4 Recent events. Developments in or the results of some or all of
the ongoing proceedings could have a material adverse impact on
Orange’s results or financial position.

14. The profitability of certain investments and Orange’s strategy
in certain countries could be affected by disagreements with
its partners in companies that it does not control.

Orange operates some of its businesses through companies that it
does not control. Articles of incorporation or agreements for some of
these activities require that some major decisions, such as the
approval of business plans or timing and size of dividends, need
approval from the different partners. Should Orange and its partners
disagree regarding these decisions, the profitability of these investments,
their contribution to Orange’s results and the strategy pursued by
Orange in the countries in which these companies are located, could
be adversely affected.

15. 25% of Orange’s capital is owned by the French public
sector, which could, in practice, determine the outcome of
votes at Shareholders’ Meetings.

At December 31, 2014, the French public sector held 25% of
Orange’s equity rights with the French State holding directly 13.4% of
the shares and voting rights and Bpifrance Participations (formerly the
FSI) holding 11.6%, and could be granted double voting rights as from
April 3, 2016 due to the Florange law which came into force on
March 29, 2014 (see Section 6.2.1 Distribution of share capital and
voting rights). Moreover, the French public sector has three
representatives on the Board of Directors out of a total 15 members.
On December 24, 2012, the French Republic and Bpifrance
Participations signed a shareholders’ agreement to act jointly. Since
there are no other significant shareholder groups, the public sector
could, in practice, determine the outcome of votes on issues that
require a simple majority at Shareholders’ Meetings and exercise a
veto over issues requiring a two-thirds majority (see Section 6.2 Major
shareholders).

of investment or returns for shareholders. In any case, Orange’s
results, cash flow and, more generally, financial position and flexibility
may be adversely affected.

See Note 11.3 Liquidity risk management to the consolidated financial
statements, which sets out, in particular, different financing sources
available to Orange, the maturity on its debt and changes to its rating,
as well as Note 11.4 Management of covenants, which contains
information on the limited commitments of the Orange Group in
relation to financial ratios and in the event of default or material
adverse change.

Interest rate risk

17. Orange’s business activities could be adversely affected by
interest rate fluctuations.

In the normal course of its business, Orange obtains most of its
funding from capital markets (particularly the bond market) and a small
part from bank loans.

Since most of its debt is at a fixed rate, Orange has a limited amount
of exposure to increases in interest rates. Of course the Group is still
exposed to interest rate increases for future financing.

To limit exposure to interest rate fluctuations, Orange from time to time
makes use of financial instruments (derivatives) but cannot guarantee
that these transactions will completely limit its exposure or that
suitable financial instruments will be available at reasonable prices. In
the event that Orange cannot use financial instruments or if its financial
instrument strategy proves ineffective, cash flow and earnings may
be adversely affected.

In addition, hedging costs stemming from interest rate fluctuations
could increase, generally, in line with market liquidity and banks’
positions.

The management of interest rate risks and an analysis of the sensitivity
of the Group’s position to changes in interest rates are set out in Note
11.1 Interest rate risk management to the consolidated financial
statements.

Credit-rating risks

18. If Orange’s debt rating is downgraded or placed under
surveillance, or its outlook is revised, by rating agencies, its
borrowing costs could increase and in certain circumstances
the Company’s access to the capital it needs could be limited
(and thus have a material adverse effect on its results and
financial position).

Orange’s financial rating is partly based on factors over which it has
no control, namely conditions affecting the electronic communications
industry in general or conditions affecting certain countries or regions
in which it operates, and can be changed at any time by the rating
agencies.

The Group's financial rating and its outlook have been downgraded
in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The rating may be revised again at any time
in light of evolving economic circumstances, or following a downturn
in the Company’s results or performance or simply due to a change
in rating agencies’ perceptions of these factors.

Credit risk and/or counterparty risk on
financial transactions

19. The insolvency or deterioration in the financial position of a
bank or other institution with which Orange has contractual
relations may have a material adverse effect on the Company.

In the normal course of its business, Orange makes use of derivatives
to manage exchange rate and interest rate risks, using financial
institutions as counterparties. Cash collateral is lodged with all bank
counterparties with which the derivatives are contracted. Nevertheless
a residual credit risk may remain if one or more of these counterparties
defaults on its commitments.

Moreover, Orange may in future have difficulties to make use of its 6
billion euro undrawn syndicated credit facility whose main maturity
date is 2018 — if several of the banks with which the derivatives are
contracted would face liquidity problems or could no longer meet their
obligations.

Investments may also expose Orange to counterparty risk, if the
financial institutions with which it has placed its investments go
bankrupt. See Note 11.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management
to the consolidated financial statements.

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

The international banking system is such that financial institutions are
interdependent. As a result, the collapse of a single institution (or even
rumors regarding the financial position of one of them) may increase
the risk for the other institutions, which would increase exposure to
counterparty risk for Orange.

For customer-related credit and counterparty risk, see Note 11.5 and
Note 3.3 Trade receivables to the consolidated financial statements.

Foreign exchange risk

20. Orange’s results and cash position are exposed to exchange
rate fluctuations.

Overall, in 2014 foreign exchange markets were highly volatile as was
the case in 2013. This trend continued at the start of 2015, thus
increasing uncertainties regarding exchange rate changes.

The main currencies in which Orange is exposed to a major foreign
exchange risk are the Polish zloty, the Egyptian pound and the pound
sterling. Fluctuations from one period to the next in the average
exchange rate for a given currency could have a material effect on the
revenues and expenses in this currency, which would in turn have a
material effect on Orange’s results. In addition to the main currencies,
Orange operates in other monetary zones, including certain emerging
markets (African countries). A fall in the currencies of these countries
would have an adverse effect on the Group’s consolidated revenues
and results. Based on 2014 data, the theoretical impact of a 10% fall
against the euro in the main currencies in which the Group’s subsidiaries
operate would have cut consolidated revenues by 800 million euros
(-2%) and Reported EBITDA by 217 million euros (-2%).

Finally, as a result of focusing its development strategy on emerging
markets, the share of Group business exposed to currency risk is likely
to rise in the future.

When preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements, the
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros
at the closing rate. This translation could have a negative impact on
the consolidated balance sheet, assets and liabilities and equity, for
potentially significant amounts, as well as on net income in the event
of disposal of its subsidiaries. For example, the hedged amount of
assets in pound sterling could be insufficient compared with the value
of the assets of EE in the United Kingdom and as a result, Orange
may not be able to collect the expected proceeds in euros. See Note
11.2 Foreign exchange risk management and Note 13 Equity to the
consolidated financial statements.

Orange manages the foreign exchange risk on commercial transactions
(stemming from operations) and financial transactions (stemming from
financial debt) in the manner set out in Note 11.2 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Notably, Orange makes use of derivatives to hedge its exposure to
exchange rate risk but cannot guarantee that suitable hedging
instruments will be available at reasonable prices.

To the extent that Orange had not used hedging instruments to hedge
part of this risk, its cash flows and results could be affected.

See Notes 10.7 Derivatives instruments and 10.8 Cash flow hedges
to the consolidated financial statements.
Risk of asset impairment

21. Orange has recognized substantial amounts of goodwill as
a result of acquisitions made since 1999. Under accounting
standards, impairment losses have in the past and may again
in the future be recorded against goodwill and other assets
in Orange’s accounts, including those of Orange SA, which
could reduce its ability to pay dividends. Orange’s results and
financial position could also be affected by the downturn in
equity markets in relation to disposal of its subsidiaries.

Orange recognized significant amounts of goodwill in connection with
the many acquisitions made since 1999, including the acquisition of
Orange Plc., Equant and Amena, as well as the investment in TPSA
(Orange Polska). At December 31, 2014, the gross value of goodwill
was 30.3 billion euros, not including goodwill from associates.

The values in use of the businesses, which are most of the recoverable
amounts and which support the book values of long-term assets
including goodwill (and equity interests on the parent company’s
balance sheet) are sensitive to the valuation method and the
assumptions used in the models. They are also sensitive to any change
in the business environment that is different to the assumptions used.
Orange recognizes assets as impaired if events or circumstances
occur that involve material adverse changes of a permanent nature
affecting the economic climate or the assumptions and targets used
at the time of the acquisition.

Over the past five years, Orange recognized significant impairment
losses in respect of its interests in Poland, Egypt, Romania and
Belgium, in particular. At December 31, 2014, the cumulative amount
of impairment losses on continuing operations was 5.5 billion euros,
not including impairment losses on the goodwill of associates.

ances could conduct Orange to
assets and to recognize further

substantial impairment losses that could have an adverse effect on

its results.

In addition, in the case of disposals or listings on a stock exchange,
the value of certain subsidiaries could be affected by changes in the
stock and debt markets.

For further information on the impairment of goodwill and recoverable
amounts (particularly key assumptions and sensitivity), see Notes 6
Gooawill, 7 Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
and 9 Interests in associates to the consolidated financial statements
and Section 4.3.2.2 From Group Reported EBITDA to operating
income.

Equity risk

22. Future public sector sales of Orange shares could affect the
share price.

At December 31, 2014, the French public sector held 25% of
Orange’s shares: 13.4% held directly by the French State and 11.6%
via Bpifrance Participations (formerly the FSI) after the disposal of
1.9% of share capital in October 2014 (see Section 6.2 Major
shareholders). In October 2014, the French government announced
between 5 and 10 billion euros in disposals over the next 18 months.
If the public sector decided to continue reducing its stake in Orange,
such a sale, or the perception that such a sale was imminent, could
have an adverse effect on the share price.

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

Electronic communications operators’ revenue totaled 33.8
billion euros excluding VAT year-on-year at the end of the third quarter
of 2014, down by 6.4% in one year (source: Arcep, Q3 2014). While
fixed narrowband revenues continued their downward trend as a
result of the constant decline in line numbers, fixed broadband
revenues continued their growth due to the increasing number of
accesses. First observed in 2011, the decline in mobile service
revenues continued, though the retail market price reduction trend
has slowed.

Fixed-line telephony market

Fixed-line subscriptions (38.8 million at September 30, 2014) have
been declining since mid-2010(down 0.7% year-on-year in the third
quarter of 2014). As a matter of fact, the higher number of broadband
voice telephone subscriptions (24.4 million in the third quarter of 2014,
up by 1.3 million year-on-year) did not offset the declining number of
PSTN subscriptions (-1.6 million year-on-year). As they only have one
VoIP subscription, fixed-lines (19.1 million at the end of September 2014,
up by 1.3 million year-on-year) have held the lion’s share since mid-
2012 and have been expanding consistently. This rise was mostly
connected to the growth of completely unbundled lines: +787,000
year-on-year, i.e. a total of 11.4 million lines at the end of September 2014
(source: Arcep, Q3 2014).

The number of high-capacity broadband and broadband Internet
accesses was 25.8 million at September 30, 2014, up by one million
from September 2013 (4.1%). Broadband lines account for 23.2 million
subscriptions (over 98% via DSL access) and grew by 1.6% year-on-
year. The number of high-capacity broadband subscriptions reached
2.5 million, up by 634,000 year-on-year. This accounted for over 60%
of the growth in the overall number of Internet accesses in the third
quarter of 2014 (source: Arcep, Q3 2014).

Revenues from fixed-line services (telephony and Internet) stood at
14.8 billion euros, virtually stable in the second (+0.4% year-on-year)
and third quarters (+0.1%) after a loss of 1.8% year-on-year in the first
quarter of 2014. On the one hand, revenues from narrowband fixed-
line services (4.3 billion euros excl. VAT) have shrunk by more than
10% per annum for several years now (-11.1% year-on-year in the third
quarter of 2014). On the other hand, revenues from broadband and
high-capacity broadband fixed-line services grew by approximately 5%
in the second and third quarters, after a 1.7% rise year-on-year in the
first quarter, reaching 10.5 billion euros (excl. VAT) over 12 rolling
months in the third quarter of 2014 and thereby accounting for 71%
of the overall revenues from fixed-line services (source: Arcep Q3 2014).
So-called convergence offers (bundled fixed-line and mobile telephony,
Internet access and TV) continue to dominate the French landscape.
The spread of Internet access has gone hand-in-hand with the type
of Web use fostered by the growth of social networks, TV, as well as
music and video downloads.

Mobile telephony

The number of active SIM cards reached 79.3 million at September 30,
2014, corresponding to a penetration rate of 120.5% of the population
(+5 percentage points year-on-year). The 3.7 million rise in SIM card
numbers year-on-year in the third quarter of 2014 was driven by
contracts, up by 3.2 million year-on-year for conventional contracts
and 1.4 million for M2M cards. Conversely, the number of prepaid
cards fell since mid-2012 and they were down by 0.9 million in the
third quarter of 2014 (source: Arcep Q3 2014).

Mobile services generated 14.1 billion euros (excl. VAT) over 12 rolling
months in revenues in the third quarter of 2014, down by approximately
231 million year-on-year (versus approximately 660 million in 2013).
This yearly decline has been slowing down since the start of 2014,
with increasingly smaller falls over the first three quarters of 2014. The
share from data services (messaging, Internet access and multimedia
services) accounted for 38% of the overall revenue from all mobile
services (+1 percentage point year-on-year), without, however, offsetting
the shrinking revenues from voice services (source: Arcep, Q3 2014).

Outgoing traffic from mobile is experiencing strong growth since the
beginning of 2012 and stood at 36.0 billion minutes in the third quarter
of 2014, up by 7.9% over Q3 2013, corresponding to 2.7 billion
additional minutes. A customer’s average use is 2 hours and 58
minutes per month (8 minutes more compared with 2013).

The data transmitted and received by customers via their mobile phone
or 3G dongle has doubled in a year. Average monthly data usage went
up for users of mobile phones (380 megabytes, i.e. +103.4% year-
on-year), 3G dongles and other Internet SIM cards (source: Arcep
Q3 2014).

The number of SMS and MMS sent (48.3 billion) during the third
quarter of 2014, continued to rise (+6.1% year-on-year), but at a
slower rate since the beginning of 2013 compared with 2012 (20-30%
growth). During the third quarter of 2014, customers sent 235 SMS
on average per month (source: Arcep Q3 2014).

Overview of business

Orange is the leader of the French broadband market, ahead of its
competitors Free, SFR, Bouygues Télécom and Numeéricable. At end-
September 2014, Orange’s market share was 40.0%, down slightly
in 2014 (-0.5 percentage point). Orange is also the market leader in
convergence offers, with nearly 6.1 million customers subscribed to
its Open package at the end of 2014. Bouygues Télécom and, to a
lesser extent, Numéricable also offer their customers this type of
package. SFR and Free have established a system of discounts given
to customers purchasing a mobile plan and a fixed-line broadband
package.

High speed broadband

In high-capacity broadband, Orange is the leader in the rollout of Fiber
To The Home (FTTH) networks, with over 3.6 million homes connectable
at end-2014, and market share of 60.1% at end-September 2014.

Orange is the leading player in the French mobile market, ahead of
competitors SFR, Bouygues Télécom, Free Mobile and all MVNOs.
At end-September 2014, Orange had market share of 34.2%
according to its own estimates, down 0.9 percentage points year-on-year.

2014 was marked by the development of the 4G high-capacity mobile
broadband network. Besides, the mobile contract market segmentation
widened between entry-level offers dominated by SIM-only deals (no
handset and no commitment) and the high end characterized by
subsidies for the purchase of a handset and the offer of dedicated
services. In the area of subsidized offers, operators have improved
their services while adapting their pricing policy in response to the
growth of SIM-only deals.

The prepaid market continued to fall sharply. The number of prepaid
cards (15 million at September 30, 2014) has been declining since
mid-2012 (a yearly drop of 0.9 million). Likewise, the number of active
prepaid cards was down by 1.2 million compared with the third
quarter of 2013 (source: Arcep, Q3 2014). The market for so-called
community prepaid cards nevertheless remained very buoyant.
Operators accordingly expanded their offers, launching unlimited top-
ups and prepaid cards with unlimited validity.

Lastly, in the wholesale market, the establishment of Full MVNO
agreements between network operators and virtual operators continued
in 2014.

Traditional fixed-line telephony services

Further to the rapid growth in full unbundling, wholesale subscriptions,
and wholesale naked ADSL access to third-party Internet service
providers, traditional telephone service business is on the decline. The
downward trend has nevertheless stabilized in terms of both revenues
and PSTN connections (down 12.2% and 12.5% respectively
compared with end-September 2013), thanks to the aggressive
marketing strategy implemented since 2012 to simplify offers while
offering more comprehensive services.

Online, Internet access, and Multimedia services

At end-December 2014, Orange had a total of 10.3 million Internet
customers, an increase of 2.4% year-on-year. A total of 9.3 million
Liveboxes were rented at end-December 2014, up 5.7% compared
with end-December 2013. The growth of convergent offers continued
in 2014, with the number of Open customers (fixed and mobile)
reaching 6.1 million at end-2014 (+28% compared with December 2013).

IP telephony had 9.1 million customers end-December 2014 and
continued to grow (+4.3%) at the same rate as in 2013, notwithstanding
fierce competition.

Television by ADSL and satellite grew by 7.7%, with 6.1 million
customers at end-December 2014. Since 2012, Orange has offered
new services allowing users to control their TV via tablets or smartphones,
and offering greater storage capacity for movies, photos and music
in the Cloud.

The broadband customer base increased by 2.4%, with Orange
winning approximately 25% of new broadband and high-capacity
broadband subscriptions over the year, thanks to the commercial
success of the Open offers and the launch of fiber services. By
contrast, broadband ARPU fell by 1.4%, affected by the increasing
penetration of Open quadruple play offers including partial rate
discounts.

Following the launch of Livebox Zen and Livebox Play on the retail
market in February 2013, Orange expanded its offering range in 2014
with Livebox Jet Fibre , which enables customers to enjoy bandwidth
of up to 500 Mbits/s. The Open Jet Fibre and Open Jet international
Fibre offers in the Open range have also been enriched in a similar
fashion to Livebox Jet Fibre .

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

In addition, for years now, Orange has been active in the research and
development of connected devices as part of the smarthome

concept. As announced at the 2014 Show Hello, Orange launched
the Homelive pack, which includes a home safety control box and
three connected devices (a smoke detector, a window/door sensor
and a movement sensor). It is available for any Internet carrier and
can be adjusted to suit any home configuration.

Internet portals and advertising management business

The Group’s main Internet portal, Orange.fr, has multi-screen
availability: web, mobile and tablet.

Orange.fr is the number 1 French Internet site and the 4" Web player
in France after Google, Facebook and YouTube, with 23.5 million
unique visitors, covering 43% of Internet users connected at least
once a month (source: Global Internet Audience — Médiamétrie/NetRatings
Panel — September 2014). Of these Internet users, 56% are fixed-line
only, 21% mobile only, and 23% a combination of both.

With these audience figures and its e-advertising sales force, Orange
generated 55 million euros of audience revenues in 2014, primarily on
orange.fr, but also including the sites of the Group and its partners.

Content-related activities
See the Content subsection of Section 3.1.8.2 Shared Services .
Carrier services

Carrier services include interconnection services for competing
operators and unbundling and wholesale market services, regulated
by Arcep. The growth in business on the wholesale market partially
offsets the decline in interconnection service revenues.

Since 2006, naked bitstream has been added to full unbundling
outside unbundled areas to allow alternative operators to extend their
non-subscription broadband offers to the entire territory. Since then,
this type of access has steadily increased.

The total number of mobile customers was 27.1 million at the end of
2014, up 0.7%. This was due to the significant growth in subscriptions,
while prepaid offerings continue to decline. Orange increased its
subscriber base to 22.0 million at end-December 2014 (+5.8%
compared with 2013) thanks to the segmentation and restructuring
of its offers and their improvement in terms of prices and services.

Orange is present in all market segments. It offers a range at very low
prices available only on the Internet with no commitment and no
handset under the Sosh brand. Sosh had a total of 2.5 million
customers at end-December 2014.

The number of Orange 4G customers exceeded 3.7 million at
December 31, 2014, a year-on-year increase of 2.7 million 4G
customers. Orange launched 4G for retail customers in April 2013,
with new Origami and Open 4G/H+ plans. At the same time, Orange
simplified its Origami range, reducing the number of plans from eight
to six, breaking down into three offers:

—the Zen offer for customers who need only a small amount of
Internet connectivity;

—the new Origami Play offer suitable for intense mobile Internet use
while providing a wide range of entertainment services;

—the Origami Jet offers for customers wanting the best smartphones
and services in France and abroad.

At the same time, services and content are included in all 4G offerings
(multi-SIM, Cloud, and Orange TV).

Orange pressed ahead with its family-based strategy through its
flagship Open offer and the development of multi-line packages, while
at the same time offering mobile Internet access at varying volumes
and speeds depending on customer needs.

This refurbishment increased the volume of offers on the core Open
and Origami ranges, and also helped to improve the premium
customer mix in 2014, as reflected by the growth of the contract
customer mix (81.1% of customers at end-2014, compared with
77.1% at end-2013).

At the same time, the MVNO customer base hosted on the Orange
network declined substantially (-32.2% year-on-year, a similar pace
as in 2013) due to the success of low-cost offers and heightened
competition at the entry level.

Average revenues per user (ARPU) were down 7.2% in 2014
compared with December 2013. This decline reflects the impact of
price adjustments across all mobile plans, the penetration of low-cost
offers, and the negative impact of the decreases in voice
interconnection charges between French mobile operators. Adjusted
for the impact of regulatory price cuts on inter-operator revenues,
ARPU was down 6.1%.

On another front, Machine to Machine SIM cards continued to grow
(+33.7% year-on-year), reaching a total number of 2.3 million at end-
December 2014. The M2M segment is one of Orange’s growth
drivers.

On the background of fierce competition and market restructuring,
Orange has retained its leadership in traditional business areas and
continued to innovate by launching new services, such as corporate
payments.

Three major trends marked the professional/SME market in 2014:
—higher value customers in the broadband and convergence offers;

—lower churn rates for broadband customers, especially in the
second half of 2014 thanks to improved satisfaction rates;

—lastly, the continuous pursuit of sources of growth, such as the
Cloud Pro services with, in particular, the emergence of Web site
offers.

—to continue adapting modes of operating and organization, in
managing 30,000 retirement departures expected in France
between now and 2020 (approximately 1/3 of its employees) in
accordance with the Social Contract .

To achieve these objectives, Orange will use three main levers:
—high-capacity fixed and mobile broadband:

— by continuing the deployment of fiber optic networks and the
number of fiber connections in 2015 in order to reach one million
customers in France by 2015, while preserving the value of the
copper network,

— by supporting a continuous increase in our 4G base with the
challenge of maintaining a premium price on 4G;

—convergence, leveraging the position as the incumbent operator in
this field so as to significantly increase customer loyalty;

—innovation in services to make them a powerful tool in customer
retention and a driver of revenue growth, with:

— the launch of new products and services and in particular the
development of connected objects,

the Cloud and web services in business and retail markets,

the development of content uses such as entertainment in
music, video and video games,

— mobile payment and financial services.

Overview of the group s business
Overview of business

Revenues from the telecommunications industry reached 21.2
billion euros in 2014, down 8.8% in spite of the growing number of
customers and expanding usage. The market was marked by intense
competition, with a strong fall in prices across all customer segments,
induced by the higher penetration rate of convergence offers, as well
as no-handset mobile offers and the now commonplace unlimited
voice mobile offers.

Fixed-line telephony and Internet

The number of fixed telephone lines decreased by 1.9% in 2014.
Fixed-line telephony revenues dropped by 14.9% due both to
cannibalization by mobiles and the migration of customers who only
had telephone-line subscriptions to cheaper bundled Internet offers.

The number of Internet customers reached 12.8 million in 2014, an
increase of 5.7%. Fixed Internet revenues grew by 2.4% notwith-
standing the 3.1% fall in average revenue per user (ARPU).

Throughout 2014, the Spanish market adopted the convergence
offers proposed by the other carriers, which are now competing with
bundled services available at a significant discount in comparison with
stand-alone options. Bundled fixed-line and mobile offers are now the
norm on the market. ADSL remains the predominant fixed-line
broadband technology, while high-capacity broadband is taking off.
Telefonica, Orange, Vodafone, and Jazztel made massive investments
in FTTH technology, which made it possible to reach a number of over
20.4 million connected households end-2014.

Mobile telephony

The number of customers rose by 1.7% in 2014, reaching 56.2 million.
The number of subscribers grew by 4.5% to 41.1 million customers,
accounting for 73.1% of the overall customer base. The number of
prepaid customers fell 5.1% to 15.1 million.

Total revenue from mobile telephony (9.9 billion euros) was down 9.3%
due to a 10.8% fall in the ARPU driven by strong competition pushing
prices down. This was partly offset by the growing use of mobile data
linked to increased smartphone sales and the use of mobile apps.

In 2014, the Spanish market continued its shift from conventional
subsidized offers to bundles and SIM-only (no-handset) offers with
optional credit facilities to purchase the phone. In 2014, the market
was dynamic also in light of the abundance offer including unlimited
voice traffic - now standard — boosted by the use of mobile data, the
adoption of 4G, and the growing penetration of low-cost MVNOs.

Orange Spain based its 2014 strategy on expanding its bundle
customer base, boosting the potential of its fiber optic customers and
growing the number of TV customers.

As for convergence offers, Orange’s Canguro bundle combines fixed
and mobile telephony for a flat fee. The number of bundle customers
reached 1.5 million, accounting for 79% of the fixed-line broadband
customer base.

The success of its convergence offers enabled Orange to net the
highest sales on the market by expanding its broadband customer
base by 16.1% in one year. Fixed-line revenues grew by 10.2% over
2013, reaching 938 million euros.

agreement signed with Vodafone. In addition, Telefonica’s regulated
offer for the resale of FTTH services launched in October 2014,
thereby increasing the options to resell high-capacity broadband
services to customers. In December 2014, Orange had 53,000 FTTH
customers.

At the end of 2014, 110,000 customers had subscribed to the multi-
screen TV Web service, with over 30 premium HD channels and
on-demand videos.

Orange’s mobile strategy focuses on providing value-for-money, high-
quality services, including low-cost offers, to meet the needs of all
customer segments. To keep in line with customer needs and the
changing market, in 2014 Orange launched new offers, such as the
new Tucan pricing and a new flexible option, Flex, allowing the
customer to customize the offer in accordance with their usage
requirements.

Orange Spain covers all mobile market segments: bundles, with
Canguro sin limites , Canguro ahorro and Canguro basico , the upper
and mid-market range with Tucan and Delfin, big data users with
Ballena, and the low end of the market with Ardilla

Orange Spain is present on the low-cost market with two offers
available only on the Internet, Amena and Simyo, as well as Mundo,
targeted at migrants. Simyo reached 500,000 customers in 2014,
Amena 200,000, and Mundo 600,000.

Orange Spain currently markets a wide range of 4G offers reaching
2.3 million customers in December 2014, and thereby increasing its
4G customer base fourfold in comparison with 2013. This rapid
expansion of 4G was boosted by:

—more capillary coverage of large and high-value cities;

—a better customer experience thanks to bandwidths of up to 200 Mbits/s
(13 times faster than 3G);

—accelerated sales of 4G devices with a wider range of models.

These initiatives enabled Orange to maintain a good sales
performance in 2014. This allowed Orange to position itself as the top
net seller in the mobile market and to expand its subscriber base to
9.4 million, up 5.1% over 2013. The prepaid customer base dropped
by 6.4% faced with the intense competition from MVNOs.

Mobile revenues shrank by 8.2% following the 19.4% drop in the
ARPU, driven by the price fall caused by the shift towards bundles
and the SIM-only model.

2014 saw the Polish economy confirms its growth. At the same time,
lower prices (mainly common consumer goods) and deflation in the
second half of the year brought inflation down to 0% in 2014, while
the unemployment rate fell to 11.5% (source: Central Statistical Office
of Poland).

The value of the Polish telecommunications services market fell by
1.9% in 2014 (according to Orange Polska estimates). The main
contributing factors were the perduring downward trend affecting fixed
voice and the fierce competition on the retail mobile market.

Fixed-line telephony market

The penetration of fixed lines continued to decline in 2014, accounting
for 22% of the population at year-end, compared with 23% at end-
2013 (source: Orange Polska estimates).

In 2014, the number of fixed broadband lines in Poland grew by 0.7%
(source: Orange Polska), a significant slowdown compared with the
previous year. However, the broadband market increased by 1.1% in
value in 2014, compared with a 5.2% increase in 2013.

The mobile telephony market is stable. The number of mobile users
increased by 1.9% in 2014, reaching 57.6 million at end-December 2014

In the broadband market, Orange Polska is still under strong
competitive pressure from cable television operators, whose
market share is climbing steadily. It was estimated at 34% at end-
December 2014 (source: Orange Polska estimates). The commercial
offers of these operators are backed by investment in infrastructure
to deploy the DOCSIS 3.0 standard and expand fiber access. Their
overall market position has been steadily growing, resulting mainly
from high popularity of the bundles they can offer, using their
advantageous position on the television market. Moreover, these
operators are able to increase the speeds offered to customers for
the same price, stimulating both average bandwidth per broadband
access on the market and customers’ expectations in this respect.
CATV is also expanding its offer towards SoHo and SME client
segments.

Alternative operators, primarily Netia, still make use of wholesale BSA
and LLU based services. However, the total volume of lines using
bitstream access fell by 50,000 in 2014, and there were 152,000
unbundled lines at end-2014, compared with 172,000 a year earlier.

Poland has four main mobile telephony operators: Orange Polska,
T-Mobile (wholly owned by Deutsche Telekom), Polkomtel (operating
under the PLUS brand, in association with broadcaster and satellite
TV platform Polsat Cyfrowy, owned by Polish magnate Zygmunt
Solorz-Zak), and P4 (held by Tollerton Investments Ltd and Novator
Telecom Poland SARL, trading under the PLAY brand).

The three main operators’ market share fell from 80% to 78% in 2014,
with PLAY’s share increasing. Orange Polska’s estimated market
share stood steady at 27.3% at end-2014.

However, growing differences in methodology between operators in
the calculation of SIM cards make it increasingly difficult to compare
the data presented by these operators.

Convergent solutions and bundles

Orange Polska’s preferred strategy to fight off the competition in the
mobile and fixed-line segments is to encourage customer loyalty by
offering attractive service bundles. The Orange Open convergence offer

is an element of that strategy, and includes a complete range of fixed-

line and mobile services, with a progressive discount for customers who
purchase new fixed-line services (including VoIP, broadband and TV),
mobile voice and broadband services.

At the end of 2014, the number of Orange Open customers had
increased by almost 90%, reaching 539 thousand, accounting for
24% of the fixed-line broadband customer base. The total number of
services sold under the Orange Open offer exceeded 2.2 million, which
means that each customer uses, on average, more than four services.

Fixed voice

Orange Polska continues to slow the erosion of its fixed-line customer
base by fostering the loyalty of its customers, primarily through sales
of personalized offers and bundles (VoIP with broadband and TV). As
such, the net loss of fixed voice customers (traditional PSTN
telephone or VoIP) was capped at 229 thousand in 2014, compared
with 346 thousand in 2013. The number of consumer PSTN lines fell
by 7% to 301 thousand (less than the 10% drop recorded in 2013),
partially offset by a 74 thousand increase in the number of VoIP users
to 540 thousand at end-2014.

In 2014, Orange Polska focused its efforts on promoting broadband
access. The broadband services portfolio for the retail market has
been simplified as much as possible: the number of broadband options
has been reduced and prices for the 12- and 24-month subscriptions
have been harmonized. More in particular, the VDSL offers portfolio
has been streamlined and improved, with just one 80 Mbits/s option
replacing the previous 40 and 80 Mbits/s plans. In December 2014,
VDSL subscriptions stood at 160,000.

In 2014, market deregulation was the key element in the development of
fixed-line broadband. On October 7, 2014, the regulator - UKE — removed
the regulatory constraints weighing down on Orange Polska in 76 urban
communities with effective competition. These areas are located in
large cities (including Warsaw, Katowice, !6d , Szczecin and Wroclaw)
and account for 30% of Polish households. Market deregulation means
Orange will be more effective and flexible when competing against
cable operators, the most powerful players on the fixed broadband
market, which are not subject to telecommunications regulations. In
order to take advantage of the opportunities opened up by
deregulation, in October 2014 Orange launched an offer dedicated to
deregulated areas, priced according to the competitive environment.

The Group continued to invest in the FTTH network in Warsaw (Stolica
pilot project) and in October 2014 the first FTTH lines started operating
in Lublin. At the end of 2014, the number of installed FTTH lines was
in excess of 70,000.

Overview of the group s business
Overview of business

Orange Polska had a total 15.6 million mobile customers at end-2014,
an increase of 2.0% (compared with an increase of 2.9% in 2013).
This growth was entirely due to the expansion of the subscription
base, up by more than 450 thousand, or more than 6% year-on-year.
This was mainly the consequence of subscriptions having become
significantly more affordable for prepaid customers who partially
migrated from one plan to the other. The success of mobile
broadband SIM cards was another growth factor, as the cards are
usually activated as part of a subscription. The ARPU fell mainly as a
consequence of price pressure (especially in the Enterprise Segment),
combined with the growing adoption of SIM-only (no-handset)
subscription plans for both voice and broadband mobile offers, as
well as lower termination and SMS fees established by the regulator
in the first half of 2013.

In 2014, Orange started selling smartphones and payment facilities in
addition to its traditional subsidized offers, available only for certain
subscription categories. This initiative aims to accelerate smartphone
adoption and to encourage SIM-only customers to switch to handset
plans.

Distribution

Actively focused on delivering excellent sales and aftersales service
to individual and business customers Orange Polska operates various
distribution channels. Three customer based sales units operate in
Orange Polska: B2B sales, B2C and SoHo sales, and Prepaid sales.

B2B sales (enterprise and business customers) use direct, indirect
and telemarketing channels dedicated to one customer portfolio. This
distribution network guarantees a comprehensive service offering,
from basic mobile and fixed-line services to customized services, and
service and project management.

Passive distribution to individual and SoHo customers is carried out
by stores under the Orange brand. These include approximately 845
company-owned sales outlets and franchises. Active distribution is
provided by sales representatives (door-to-door sales) operating from
direct sales centers located across Poland. Distance selling centers
operate via two additional channels — Telesales and on-line sales. All
channels offer a wide range of mobile services, mobile and fixed Internet
subscriptions, TV packs, value-added services and fixed voice.

Prepaid sales, offering typical mobile services, employs a comprehensive
net of sales points including Orange branded POS and distributors
(convenience stores, kiosks, gas stations). Orange Prepaid starter sets
are widely available at 34 thousand points of sale, but can be
recharged in more than 98 thousand outlets.

At end-December 2014, Orange Polska provided services based on
VDSL technology to over 4,000 sites. At the same time, migration of
the aggregation network from ATM to IP continued. AT end-2014,
almost 69% of Neostrada customers and 55% of IDSL customers
were connected via the IP aggregation network.

protection mechanisms. In view of the increase in traffic, the backbone
network has been sized to allow IP connections at 100 Gbits/s, three
of which have already been commercialized.

In 2014, consolidation of the Orange and T-Mobile mobile networks
was completed as part of the co-development process between the
two operators, with the activation of UMTS 900 throughout the country.
The shared 3G network (UMTS/HSPA) accordingly covered
approximately 99.4% of the Polish population at end-2014. The shared
radio access network agreement also covers the 4G LTE technology.
Under the agreement, the partners made joint investments to develop
the LTE network, and Orange acquired the right to use T-Mobile’s
1800 MHz frequencies, in particular the 10 MHz bandwidth allocated
by the regulator to T-Mobile for a period of 14 and a half years, in
June 2013. The two operators now share close to 5,000 1,800 MHz
LTE sites covering almost 61% of the Polish population at end-2014.

2015 Outlook

Orange Polska expects its revenues to continue to shrink in 2015.
More in particular, it expects continued structural pressure on the prices
of fixed voice services. In addition, revenues could be affected by price
revaluations in the B2B segment, for both mobile and fixed-lines.

Overview of business

Value creation associated with convergence, the expected expansion
of LTE coverage and service development should help slow down this
fallin revenue. The shift towards a streamlined, more flexible business
model and the continued efforts to cut costs aim to protect the
EBITDA margin (excluding the impact of exceptional risks or litigations
and other material non-recurring costs or gains). At the same time,
thanks to strong market demand for fast Internet services, a more
favorable regulatory framework, and the promising results of the FTTH
pilot project, in 2015 Orange Polska plans to invest up to 450 million
zlotys in the fiber optic network to connect up to 650,000 households
at over 100 Mbits/s. Overall, investments should fall short of 2 billion
zlotys in 2015, excluding expenses associated with the acquisition of
4G frequencies. In 2015, cash flow generation should stand at around
900 million zlotys, excluding certain exceptional items, such as the
potential acquisition of new frequencies, the possible payment of a
fine to the European Commission, and certain other potential
litigations.

The telecommunications market remained stable in 2014, while the
mobile market was down 4% compared with the previous year.

Fixed-line telephony

Convergence offers are the norm in the Belgian fixed-line telephony
and Internet market. The market is primarily dominated by incumbent
operator Belgacom and by cable operators: Telenet (Flanders and
Brussels), Voo (Wallonia and Brussels) and Numéricable (Brussels).
This duopoly leaves little room for new entrants. One of the last

In 2014, the strong churn rate between different operators that was
noted in 2013 weakened following the introduction of the Open
telecommunications law. The pricing war slowed down significantly,
with most operators leaving their offers unchanged.

A positive change in 2014 was the significant growth of the mobile
data market, following the introduction of 4G technology and a
targeted handset subsidy policy rolled out by all operators.

The highly competitive mobile market is more evenly balanced than
the fixed-line market, with three main players: Proximus (Belgacom’s
mobile telephony brand), Mobistar and Base, plus 37 MVNOs, that is
to say 5 fewer than in 2013. These MVNOs account for almost a
quarter of the total SIM-card base in Belgium. Their customer base is
mainly comprised of prepaid customers with ethnic offers.

At year-end Mobistar had a 41% market share by number of SIM
cards connected to its network, including MVNO and Machine to
Machine SIMs.

In 2014, the Belgacom brand was replaced by Proximus for all the
operator’s activities (mobile, fixed-line telephony and TV).

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

Orange operates in Belgium through Mobistar, which is listed on the
Brussels Stock Exchange. The Orange Group holds 52.9% of the capital.

Mobistar ended 2014 with 5.47 million SIM cards connected to its
network, an increase of 7.8% compared with 2013. This actually
corresponds to a decline in the mobile customer base, largely offset
by an increase in the number of M2M (Machine to Machine) cards and
MVNO customers.

As a matter of fact, Mobistar’s MVNO customer base grew by 28.7%
and the number of active M2M SIM cards grew by 25.6%, with an
installed base of 1.56 million and 0.87 million respectively at end-
2014. This year the erosion of the mobile customer base wasn’t as
fast, shifting from 3.17 to 3.04 million, and the fourth quarter saw,
once again, a positive number of net acquisitions of contract
customers.

At the end of 2014, Mobistar reached almost half a million 4G
customers, with 4G traffic accounting for over a third of total mobile
data traffic.

The average revenue per user (ARPU), slightly down year-on-year,
nevertheless started to grow again in the last quarter 2014 for the first
time in three years, reaching an average value of 24.3 euros per
month. This rise was particularly significant in the residential contracts
segment, which was boosted particularly by the expansion of higher-
value pricing plans tied to 4G data use. The ARPU of professional
customers also grew slightly in 2014.

Mobistar s offers

The value offered to Mobistar customers remains unchanged, and is
based on a set of key principles: the clarity of the offer, the absence of
promotion or discrimination between old and new customers, and now
the absence of commitment. Mobistar wants to build a lasting relationship
with its customers based on competitively priced offers. Mobistar also
continued its targeted subsidy policy for 4G handsets in 2014.

In the prepaid segment, Mobistar enriched its offer portfolio by
launching 1617 , a new plan specifically targeting foreigners living in
Belgium who frequently communicate with their friends and families
in their countries of origin.

The subscription offers segment of the Animal range (Kangourou ,
Dauphin and Panth re ), which satisfy customer needs, were left
unchanged in 2014, thereby boosting transparency.

Mobistar launched the MySwap option at the beginning of the year,
guaranteeing its customers the option to trade in their 4G
smartphones for 3 euros per month, which grew in the last quarter of
2014.

Mobistar also innovated its loyalty program with the launch of Have A
Nice Day (HAND), to thank its customers with exclusive gifts.

Shape portfolio, giving the option to choose the subscription that best
suits the professional needs of each employee (communications,
mobile Internet, SMS) from six different plans. Mobistar also launched
Mobiline, a B2B solution for SMEs that replaces traditional telephony
infrastructure with a virtual mobile telephony switchboard (all it needs
is a SIM card and web interface) and cuts costs by 50% while
retaining the advantages of a fixed line.

Lastly, at the end of 2014, Mobistar, in partnership with Systemat,
launched Mobifleet, a new Cloud service created for its Enterprise
customers with up to 50 employees offering easy and secure
management of smartphone and tablet fleets.

In 2014, Mobistar invested close to 150 million euros in its network,
mainly for the rollout of 4G technology and the expansion of its access
and transmission network, with a view to improving service quality,
bandwidth and coverage for all its customers.

Launched in April 2014, Mobistar’s 4G network covered over 1,000
cities and towns, i.e. almost 9.7 million residents, accounting for 88%
of the Belgian population at end-2014. Thanks to its rollout strategy
in the 800 MHz band, Mobistar also offers 64% coverage inside
buildings.

Based on the most recent drive test carried out by independent firm
Commsquare, Mobistar is the operator with the widest 4G coverage
in Belgium, the best indoor 4G coverage, as well as the best 3G
coverage. Lastly, Mobistar secured its wide frequency portfolio by
renewing the license for its 2G network and becoming the leading
operator across all voice parameters (according to the same study).

In 2015, Mobistar will continue to invest in the rollout of its 4G
network, with completion expected by the end of the year.

Mobistar has already invested 4.6 million euros in cable activities and
started testing Internet and digital television services in 2014. It plans
to launch innovative offers in 2015. Mobistar will be marketing its new
offers as soon as the regulator will have clarified the last few points of
the adopted pricing model (still in progress). It will then become a true
convergence operator with attractive offers for all its customers.

Lastly, 2015 will see the company continue the transformation projects
launched since 2013, which have already enabled Mobistar to
generate material savings, including over 50 million in 2014.

Competition in the mobile telephony market in Luxembourg is intense.
Orange Communications Luxembourg — a wholly owned subsidiary
of Belgian operator Mobistar — ranks third in terms of market share,
behind market leader Post Luxembourg, a subsidiary of the
incumbent operator, and Tango, a subsidiary of Belgian operator
Belgacom. A 4" operator, Join (MVNO of Post) entered the market in
January 2014. Post Luxembourg also has the largest market share in
the fixed-line and Internet market.

2014 was also marked by the regulator’s decision (ILR) to lower
mobile call termination rates from 10.5 euro cents to 0.98 euro cents
in February 2014. The impact of this decision on 2014 revenues was
11.2 million euros.

Orange Communications Luxembourg strengthened its leadership as
an innovator, being the first operator to introduce the first complete
European plan. The new portfolio has been 4G since September 2013.
At end-2014, 38.7% of the retail customer base enjoyed high-capacity
mobile broadband.

In 2014, the Romanian economy performed well compared with other
European Union countries, with GDP up approximately 2.4% year-on-
year. However, this was a slowdown compared with the 3.5% growth
recorded in 2013, mostly linked to a strong deceleration in the second
quarter (1.2% year-on-year). Household consumption and exports
were the main growth drivers. In the second half of 2014, renewed
confidence and higher disposable incomes sustained consumption.
Public and private investments are expected to recover in 2015.

Overall, the Romanian telecommunications market fell slightly in 2014,
down 4.60% in terms of value (source: Orange Romania), primarily
due to the lowering of call termination rates in April and to the decline
in fixed voice (with termination rates also lowered), and in spite of data
services taking off. The fixed-line broadband market — which has a
low penetration rate — continued to grow. Pay TV also grew thanks to
content and multi-screen offers. The mobile telephony market
remained relatively stable.

43% of Orange Romania’s total mobile customer base of 10.4 million
(excluding M2M) are contract subscribers (4.4 million), up one
percentage point. This upward movement was fostered by
digitalization and 4G services, in both the Animals offers which all
include this technology, the 4G traffic pack, and the flexioption for
prepaid customers.

Orange included Internet access in all its contract offers, as well as
international minutes for calls to the fixed and mobile networks. More
specifically, the Pantera offers include a bundle of roaming minutes
and data, and the option to use them with an additional SIM card.

This new offering portfolio boosted the appetite for smartphones and
tablets, notably those compatible with 4G, and contributed to strong
growth in data services traffic and revenues.

In 2014, Orange was first to launch an exclusive on-line offer for
youngsters aged 18 to 35 years old, enabling them to configure their
plan at any time based on their needs. In the prepaid market, Orange
reacted to growing competition thanks to advertising campaigns, a
new point-based loyalty program, new options and interchangeable
components within commercial offers.

Orange provides the best 4G coverage in the country, reaching 90%
of urban areas. This extensive coverage enabled rapid adoption of 4G
smartphones and significant growth of data traffic. Moreover, in 2014
the 4G and 4G+ service (offering bandwidth of up to 300 Mbits/s) was
deployed across the subway network in Bucharest.

Orange started to implement its shared network agreement with
Vodafone, signed in 2013 for a term of 16 years. This led to better 2G
and 3G coverage, while the fiber optic network in urban areas
supported the development of 4G services. At end-2014, 25% of the
network was operational according to schedule.

As part of its strategic plan to improve operational efficiency, in the
second half of 2014, Orange signed an agreement with Ericsson to
outsource network maintenance and operation at a European level.

In 2014, the contraction of the telecommunication services market,
which has been ongoing for years now, continued, albeit at a slower
pace compared with the previous year (down 4.6% in 2014 after a
7% fall in 2013), in an economic environment marked by moderate
GDP growth (+2.4%).

As in the previous years, the fixed-line telephone market (including
voice over IP) continued to decline in 2014 (client numbers down
5.8%). The fixed Internet market grew by 12.2% in terms of volume
and 9.7% in terms of value in 2014, with a customer base reaching
1.2 million at year-end.

The fixed-line broadband market in Slovakia is dominated by Telekom,
the incumbent operator, whose infrastructure covers the whole
country, followed by the cable operator UPC that has been present in
the market for many years. Orange Slovensko, that deployed its fiber
optic network (FFTH) in approximately 330,000 households in
Slovakia, and has more recently commercialized DSL fixed-line
Internet services via a commercial agreement with Telekom, is ranked
third in this market and is continuing to grow.

Orange Slovensko competes with two other operators on the mobile
market: Telefonica O2 and Slovak Telekom 51% owned by Deutsche
Telekom). O2’s entrance in the Slovakian mobile market in 2007
fostered competition and in 2014 O2 continued to gain market share
through an attractive pricing policy. Orange Slovensko, however, still
managed to remain market leader, with a market share of 44.6% in
terms of volume, virtually stable in comparison with 2013. The mobile
penetration rate is close to 120%.

In 2014, mobile customers under contract accounted for over 80%

In a market where the low-price strategy of competitor O2 contributed to
a rapid decline in the voice revenue per user (ARPU), Orange Slovensko

centered its sales strategy on family-oriented offers, notably bundles
combining voice and data, which were especially successful in the
mobile broadband segment for tablets. Accordingly, almost 100,000
tablets with an Orange SIM card were sold in 2014, double the number
in the previous year, making Orange the uncontested market leader.

In 2014, the Moldovan telecommunications market recovered slightly,
growing by 1% after being affected, in 2013, by competitive pressure
associated with the portability of fixed and mobile numbers and the
reduction of call terminations. Telecommunications revenues in
Moldova were stable year-on-year, reaching 5.8 billion leis in 2014.
The main market driver was the growth of fixed Internet (+18%) and
mobile services (+2%), partially offsetting the fall in fixed-line voice (-
10%). The fixed-line Enterprise market saw its revenues drop by 10%.

Overall, the market remained stable in 2014, with a customer base of
6.4 million. Only fixed Internet services expanded slightly, up 8.7% in
comparison with 2013 (+40,600 users). The mobile customer base
stagnated due to market saturation, with a penetration rate of 123%.
In such context, mobile operators mainly compete on price, the main
goal being customer retention.

operator, leading player on the convergence market) holds a 9%
market share, up 0.9 percentage points.

In 2014, the average revenue per user (ARPU) was strongly impacted
by the offers launched following the implementation of portability in
2013. The ARPU fell by 2.6% in the first three quarters of 2014,
reaching 72.2 lei. The main reason was the optimization of tariffs
associated with the launch of unlimited offers by the three operators,
as well as the negative effects of regulation.

In 2014, Orange Moldova’s revenues remained stable at 2.8 billion
leis. The fall in revenues from outgoing calls is due primarily to the
slowdown in the prepaid segment (-79 million lei). The decrease in
revenues linked to ARPU erosion was fully offset by handset sales and
income from incoming traffic. Equipment sales were the main growth

factor for revenues (+58 million leis in 2014), mainly due to affordable
instalment offers with zero advance fee. Incoming traffic revenues
(+31 million leis) grew mainly in conjunction with the positive impact
of exchange rates and increased traffic (primarily through Moldcell).

Overview of the group s business
Overview of business

Orange Moldova was able to maintain a market share of 56% in terms
of volume and 69% in terms of value in 2014. Its success is due to its
ability to consistently adapt its offer portfolio to the needs of an
increasingly demanding market:

—the Animals offers were redesigned in summer and are now
segmented more clearly (priority to social network access for young
customers, to large data volumes for the “digital” segment, or
generous voice allowances for those who prefer to communicate
with their loved ones);

—the introduction of minutes roll-over for prepaid offers;

—wider access to handset (smartphone) acquisition through
installment payment facilities, enabling greater data services usage:
penetration in this segment expanded significantly year-on-year
both for subscribers under contract and prepaid offers; a new store
concept focusing on a wide range of digital products (tablets,
smartphones and other communication devices) also contributed
to reach this goal.

All these initiatives kept acquisitions at a high level, customers were
consistently migrating from prepaid to contract offers (which represent
the majority of subscription acquisitions) and the ARPU erosion trend
was contained.

2015 Outlook

Tensions between Ukraine and Russia —- Moldova’s main trading
partners — should cause a slowdown in exports.

On this background, in 2014 Orange Moldova will continue its efforts
to maintain profitability at high levels, taking advantage of operational
optimization plans, and to consolidate its leadership of the mobile
market.

In 2015, priorities will be focused on:

—promoting 4G smartphones, handsets and tablets through
installment payments, to reach 27% of the overall installed base;

—expanding data services with the launch of new Animals offers, with
data options;

—launching My Orange and the Cloud for individuals;
—optimizing costs for Enterprise customers;

—developing online services (online stores and payments, social
networks);

—becoming a fully integrated, convergent operator;

—developing the Libon offer to face over the top (OTT) operators and
launching a dashboard to monitor multimedia usage;

—developing sales of connected items (clothing and accessories,
video-surveillance, MiFi for cars).

3.1.4.6 Armenia

The telecommunications services market and the
competitive environment

The telecommunications industry accounts for 3.5% of Armenia’s
GDP, of which 2.6% for the mobile market and 0.9% for fixed
communications (mainly shared among Beeline, Ucom and Rostelecom).
At the end of the third quarter of 2014, the mobile penetration rate
was 97.6% of the population.

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

At the same date, the market shares of mobile operators — estimated in
terms of value — were as follows: Vivacell-MTS: 63.5%, Beeline: 20.3%
and Orange Armenia: 16.3% (source: PSRC and Orange).

Orange Armenia’s share of the mobile broadband market segment
went up in value by one percentage point year-on-year, compared
with the third quarter of 2013. With a 59% market value share, Orange
Armenia is the leader of this segment, while its market value share
remained stable for voice services.

Orange s Activities in Armenia

Orange Armenia was granted a license to operate mobile
communication services in the 900, 1,800, and 2,100 MHz bandwidths
on November 19, 2008, for a period of 15 years. Commercial operations
were launched in November 2009.

Orange Armenia had approximately 632,000 active customers at end-
2014, including 502,000 voice customers, 106,000 mobile broadband
users and 25,000 (Machine to Machine) cards.

In 2014, Orange Armenia’s priority was to boost sales and improve
its EBITDA. It also worked to improve customer loyalty. Among the
year’s main events, especially noteworthy were the new SIM-only
contracts (without subsidized handsets), as well as the launch of a
new offer allowing customers to share their broadband data allowance
across theirmobile Internet and voice subscription with a smartphone.
Orange Armenia was also the first operator on the market to launch
offers dedicated to tablets (My Tab) with bandwidth of 1 Mbits/s, as
well as new subscription offers aimed at supporting revenues, notably
through data usage.

Distribution

Orange Armenia relies on an extensive distribution network, with 78
branded stores (including one mobile store and 70 franchises), as well
as 850 indirect points of sale. Over 6,000 sales outlets distribute
prepaid recharges (including Orange stores, scratch card sales
outlets, banks, ATMs, or electronic recharging outlets).

The Network

39 new radio sites became operational in 2014, extending the existing
network’s coverage and capacity (with better quality), to keep in line
with the expansion of voice and data traffic. In addition, 10 mini-cells
were installed in the nation’s capital, Erevan, to improve the quality
and capacity of the 3G network.

2015 Outlook

In 2015, Orange Armenia will continue to fully focus on increasing
customer value (ARPU), the profitability of the existing customer base,
and the acquisition of new value-generating customers on both the
voice and mobile Internet segments, while continuing to acquire
business customers. The simplicity of its offers, communication and
customer experience remain the focal point of its strategy.

* Penetration rate (as a % of the population).

The Egyptian mobile telephony market is comprised essentially of
prepaid customers. Operators are increasingly extending their offers
into the lower end of the market, reducing connection charges,
offering inexpensive handsets and allowing customers to recharge
small amounts. This strategy is aimed to acquire middle-class and rural
customers, and has resulted in a reduction of the average revenue
per user (ARPU). Signs of recovery emerged in the tourism industry
in the second half of 2014. This followed several years of strong
business decline, which negatively impacted income from roaming.

While the penetration rate of fixed-line telephony continues to fall, and
the development of the broadband Internet remains very limited, the
mobile penetration rate continues to increase, offering the possibility
of growth in the data and mobile Internet businesses. The mobile
penetration rate reached 120% of the population at end-2014.

The Egyptian market is characterized by an increasingly competitive
environment. Most competition is between mobile operators, but is
also moving increasingly into the Internet and B2B markets. At the
same time, alliances and integrations are changing the shape of the
telecommunications market and leading different players to move
towards a convergence strategy.

ECMS was the first operator to launch mobile services in Egypt, which
it did in 1998 under the Mobinil brand. Vodafone Egypt was the
second operator to enter the market, also in 1998, under the
ClickGSM brand. It has positioned itself in the high value-added
customer segment by virtue of its 3G network, launched in 2006.
Etisalat, a subsidiary of Etisalat U.A.E., entered the market in 2007
with an aggressive low-cost strategy.

Despite the highly competitive market, Mobinil managed to increase
customer numbers in 2014 and maintain its number-two spot with a
33.5% market share (source: GSMA February 2015). Vodafone
remains the market leader, with a share of 41%, and Etisalat is in
3° place with 25.5%.

a fall of 3.1% compared with 2013; 83% of customers are in the
prepaid segment. The proportion of prepaid customers decreased in
2014 in the wake of the success of capped contracts.

Annual revenues totaled 11 billion Egyptian pounds in 2014, an
increase of 3.9% compared with 2013.

Distribution

Mobinil sells products and services in Egypt through different
distribution channels:

—52 Mobinil stores;

55 franchise stores;

—33 Mobinil kiosks;

—49 outsourced kiosks;
—specialized distributors and retailers.

Network and licenses

ECMS has a GSM license and a 15-year UMTS-3G license obtained
in 2007. A coverage plan detailed over five years accompanies the
grant of the 3G license, and the Egyptian Telecommunication
Regulatory Authority (NTRA) guaranteed to Mobinil the grant of other
frequency bands, the possibility of applying a special rate to its
customers for communications within the Mobinil network (on net
mode), and the reservation of a new network code. Additional
spectrum was acquired in 2013.

2015 Outlook

The social and political situation has started to stabilize in Egypt.
However, the economic recovery has been slow. ECMS will pursue
the action plans initiated in 2012 with a strategy focused on value
creation and operational efficiency. ECMS’s management will continue
to focus on cost-monitoring and profit margin improvements through
major initiatives like a large transformation program. A comprehensive
license should be granted to the current mobile operators in early
2015. Telecom Egypt will secure a mobile license, thereby becoming
the 4h mobile operator on the market.

2014, competition between the operators was fierce, with prepaid
mobile recharge offers, unlimited voice offers with free access and,
increasingly, unlimited mobile data offers. Competition for data usage
is continuing in keeping with improved quality of service, the extension
of 3G coverage, a greater offering, and the popularization of
smartphones and Orange Internet dongles. Orange, which topped

The number of Orange mobile customers, which consists almost
entirely of prepaid formulas, increased by 9.9% in 2014, versus 3.5%
in 2013. This change in customer base growth is due firstly to
regulatory constraints regarding the identification of customers, which
slowed down recruitment rates in 2013. Furthermore, customer
acquisition campaigns, with in particular more customers of Kir ne
avec Orange offers, combined with campaigns to increase the loyalty
of existing customers (Bonus Program) have tripled the increase in
the number of customers registered in 2013, despite the 3G offensive
of Tigo.

The downward trend of ARPU was enhanced in 2014 for two reasons:
the drop in revenue from incoming traffic, related to the regulatory
drop in mobile call termination rates; and the fast growth in usages
making a lower contribution to revenue (in particular mobile data).

The number of fixed broadband Internet (ADSL) subscribers fell slightly
(-1.8%) in 2014, due to the competition related to the development
of 3G mobile Internet offers. The total number of fixed lines fell slightly
compared with 2013 (-2.4%). This near-stabilization, despite the

strong competition in mobile activity, is related to the development of
commercial offers such as Illiminet Kheweul and dual play formulas
(voice and ADSL), together with the strong penetration of CDMA
(Yakhanal) in rural areas.

The mobile offer of Orange Senegal consists mainly of prepaid
formulas based on three types of offers (Diamono Classique , Diamono
S Cool and Diamono Door Waar ). Furthermore, the Kir ne avec
Orange offer is an MVNO-type offer developed in partnership with
Kirene. The Orange Money mobile payment offer had around
1.7 million registered customers at end-2014. The expansion of the
partnership with new players in merchant payment and invoice
payment led to significant growth in the volume of transactions and
tripled revenue compared with 2013.

The development of the mobile Internet offer is continuing with the
Pass Internet Everywhere sold by retailers from 100 CFA francs, the
arrival of nearly 970,000 Internet dongles at the end of 2014, and
nearly 2 million users.

In 2014, the increase in civil servant salaries and the commissioning
of several infrastructure projects (highways, bridges, schools, energy,
water, etc.) reflect the economic recovery in Ivory Coast after the
severe post-electoral crisis in 2011. The government is undertaking
to foster and maintain economic growth (8.5% in 2014). The political
and security situation remains fragile, despite tremendous efforts made.

lvory Coast’s mobile market grew from 19.3 million to 21.3 million SIM
cards between 2013 and 2014, an increase of 10.3%. The mobile
operator penetration rate grew from 87.9% to 94.2%. This increase
reflects continued expansion in the number of consumers with
multiple SIM cards and the number of unlimited plans being offered,
as well as falling communication prices and handset costs.

The number of fixed lines of Céte d’lvoire Télécom represents a low
percentage of the total number of customers and continues to
decrease, due to strong competition on account of growing mobile
development (especially due to multi-equipment).

There was strong growth in the broadband mobile market, with the
arrival of 3G (in April 2012) and a total of 1,727,122 customers at the
end of 2014 (including 212,257 Orange Internet dongles and
1,514,865 Mobile MultiMedia).

At the end of 2014, Céte d’lvoire Télécom had approximately 43,000
ADSL Internet customers.

Distribution

Since the operational merger of Orange Céte d’lvoire and Céte
d'Ivoire Télécom in 2010, Orange has had the largest network of retail
stores in the country’s telecom sector, a total of 119. Of these, 34
were directly owned and 85 were franchises at end-May 2014.
Indirect distribution is managed through a network of 14 exclusive
partners comprising close to 80,000 retailers.

In 2014, Orange Céte d’lvoire continued to offer training to its
partners, to help them build their business skills. The company also
worked with its entire distribution network to promote the Orange
Money service.

2015 Outlook

In 2015, the effects of the Group’s good economic performance
should be reflected in improved living standards in 2015. However,
the presidential election planned for the end of 2015 threatens political
stability. Within this context, the priorities of Orange Céte d’lvoire
Télécom in 2015 will focus on the following:

—turning the Orange brand into consumers’ favorite brand by aiming
for excellence in terms of offers (Internet, audio and video content,
mobile banking, e-services) and the customer experience across
all segments (SME, young customers, etc.);

—attracting customers with higher value to the market by positioning
itself in growth sectors while fostering the loyalty of existing
customers;

—capturing the lion’s share of growth in mobile markets and ICT
(service integration) in the Enterprise segment;

—supporting the transformation of fixed lines:

— by offering an accessible offer to boost the recruitment of fixed-
line customers,

— by developing new MSAN technology to secure the fixed-line
network in order to cover high-demand areas once again.

2015 Outlook

Competition on the market is expected to remain fierce in 2015,

4G and fiber optic services launched by Zain and Orange.

3.1.5.5 Mali

The mobile market has continued to grow rapidly, with the penetration
rate increasing from 24% at end-2008 to 137% at end-2014 (source:
Orange Mali estimates). Orange, the second company to join the
mobile market, is now the leader in the mobile market with a 53.8%
market share (source: Orange Mali estimates). Orange’s main competitor
is the incumbent operator Sotelma, owned by Maroc Télécom, owned
itself by Etisalat, which acquired Vivendi’s 53% stake. The government
granted a third comprehensive license to the Planor-Monaco Telecom
International consortium in January 2013; the consortium will operate
through the Malian company Alpha Télécommunication Mali SA (Atel-SA).

At end-2014, Orange Mali’s mobile network covered about 86% of
the population and 40% of the country, and Orange Mali had a total
of 12.8 million active customers (99.9% of them prepaid customers).
The main mobile usage is voice and SMS, but mobile data and mobile
broadband have developed rapidly since the launch in May 2010 of
3G. In June 2010, Orange Mali launched the Orange Money service,
which allows users to carry out financial transactions from their mobile
phones. The service had nearly 2.3 million customers at the end of
2014.

The broadband Internet customer base included more than 140,600
subscribers at the end of 2014, an increase of more than 23% compared
with 2013.

In 2015, the main challenges for Orange Mali will be as follows:

—being the leader in terms of customer experience to become the
favorite operator in Mali;
—keeping its position as market leader in terms of volume and value;

—turning Orange Money into a financial success following on from its
commercial success.

3.1.5.6 Cameroon

The mobile market had a penetration rate of 83% (source: GSMA).
The year 2014 confirmed the market trend of developing abundance
offers combined with lower prices and growing usages.

Orange Cameroon had 6.2 million active customers at the end of
2014, more than 98% of them prepaid customers, an increase of 3%
compared with 2013. Against a background of increased competition
(marked in particular by the arrival of a new operator, Nexttel, in the
third quarter of 2014, which enjoyed the exclusive right to 3G until the
end of 2014), Orange Cameroon maintained its position as second
largest operator on the market, behind MTN.

Furthermore, Orange Cameroon was a market pioneer by introducing
its Plenty range in the first quarter of 2014. For the first time, the range
offers contracts combining voice and data services, associated with
an attractive pricing plan. The fast-developing sources of growth
include mobile data (an increase of 39% in the number of users and
107% in revenue) and value-added services such as Orange Money
(+52% in number of subscribers) driven by the establishment of
several partnerships.

The year 2014 was marked by the acceleration of the Orange
Cameroon investment program in order to increase in particular its
number of mobile sites (21% increase) and to modernize its network
with a view to offering 3G services in the near future.

The competitive environment will see new developments following the
award of a fourth GSM license to the incumbent operator Camtel,
from January 1, 2015.

3.1.5.7 Guinea Conakry

Orange Guinée, the fourth entrant of five operators in this highly
competitive mobile market, was the leading operator at the end of
2014 with a market share of 50.6%, ahead of Areeba (MTN group),
Cellcom, and Intercel (source: Orange). Mobile use primarily includes
voice. However, considerable growth was seen in mobile data in 2014
due to the investments in the ACE submarine cable and the 3G
network, and thanks to successful commercial offers. Orange had a
total of 4.5 million active customers at end-2014, almost exclusively
in the prepaid segment, an increase of 39.1% compared with 2013.
Orange Guinée has invested massively to expand its network and now
offers 2G services to all sub-prefectures in the country and 3G
services to all prefectures. Orange Guinée has the most extensive
network of all operators in the country. Orange has a direct distribution
network comprising seven branches and ten reception points.
Furthermore, Orange has an indirect distribution network comprising
145 stores in particular.

3.1.5.8 Botswana

The mobile market is still developing, despite a high penetration rate
that reached 158% of the population (source: Business Monitor
International 2015). Orange is one of three operators that hold multi-
service licenses with Mascom (an MTN subsidiary) and BTC, the
incumbent operator.

In 2014, Orange cemented its number two ranking in the mobile
market, with 900,000 active customers at year-end (source:
Orange Botswana) and a market share of 32% (source: Botswana
Telecommunication Authority). Mobile voice and SMS represented

Overview of the group s business
Overview of business

67% of revenues, and new data services (data and content) grew
strongly (up 57% compared with 2013).

2014 also saw the launch of innovative services such as International
Airtime Transfer (Service to purchase credit for friends and family
abroad), for example. Furthermore, Orange continued to develop the
Orange Money solution and ranked number one with 63% of market
share (source: Botswana Telecommunication Authority).

The Orange mobile network covers nearly the entire population of
Botswana, including more than 50% for 3G services (with 21-42
Mbits/s). At the end of 2014, the regulatory authority authorized
Orange Botswana to launch 4G, and the first sites have been
deployed.

Orange has a distribution network of 19 stores around the country,
plus an indirect distribution network made up of retail chains and
wholesalers.

Orange Botswana’s priorities for 2015 will be as follows:
—continued growth in the number of customers;

—the launch of 4G convergence offers;

—growth in mobile data usages and content;

—growth in revenue in the Enterprise segment;

—continued excellence in the customer experience.

3.1.5.9 Kenya

With a population of about 46.1 million, Kenya has 33,2 million mobile
customers, representing a penetration rate of 72% (source: GSMA 2014).

The single fixed-line operator, Telkom Kenya, in which the Orange
Group has a 70% interest, faces two competitors in the mobile market
(Safaricom and Airtel, operator of Indian group Bharti), and several
competitors in the market for business data communications (Safaricom,
Access Kenya, KDN, Wananchi).

Telkom Kenya continued its return to growth in 2014 (5% increase in
revenue, up to 85 million euros) by expanding mobile data usage and
services to large companies and SMEs. Thanks to its investments to
improve and expand its mobile network and renovate its fixed network
(migrating from copper to fiber optics), Telkom Kenya aims to
significantly increase its customer base. In light of the difficulties faced
in terms of its financial results, the company continued its transformation
plan and the streamlining of its cost base to improve its margins.

3.1.5.10 Niger

The most recent entrant in the mobile market, Orange has a market
share of 35%, second to Airtel and ahead of Moov and Sahelcom
(source: GSMA January 2015). Its mobile customer base included
1.67 million active customers (Source: Orange). Orange Niger is the
market leader in mobile broadband Internet thanks to its exclusive 3G
offer. Orange Niger also ranks second behind Airtel for the coverage of
its mobile network, with coverage of 75% of the population in 2014 and
a network of over 433 2G sites and 103 3G sites (source: Orange Niger).

Orange Niger markets its products through a direct distribution
network made up of six branches, supplemented by 89 distributors
and 17,600 sales outlets located throughout the country.

In 2015, Orange Niger aims to remain the country’s leading ISP. It also
aims to consolidate its position in the mobile market by reinforcing its
network in the country’s major cities and continuing to improve service
quality.

3.1.5.11 Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has a population of 79 million,
putting it in fourth place in Africa in terms of population (source: IMF,
October 2014). However, the mobile penetration rate is only 58%
(source: GSMA February 2015), much lower than in most neighboring
countries.

In October 2011, Orange acquired 100% of the mobile operator
Congo Chine Télécoms. CCT holds a national 2G and 3G license, and
boasts excellent growth potential due to the country’s low mobile
penetration rate. CCT was renamed Orange RDC and the Orange
brand introduced on December 5, 2012.

The number of Orange RDC mobile customers was 4.3 million at the
end of 2014, compared with 1.8 million at the end of 2013, i.e. an
increase of 140% (source: Orange RDC).

In 2015, Orange RDC aims to achieve revenue growth of 45%, in
addition to a 50% increase in its customer base, which would amount
to two million new customers. To that end, it will focus on the following
areas of development:

—speeding up the network coverage: having a level of coverage
almost similar to that of the leaders Vodacom & Airtel;

—improving technical service quality and customer satisfaction;

—distribution: improving capillarity and the network of sales
outlets/regionalizing business activity;

—sources of growth and opportunities:

— developing the B2B segment with high-capacity broadband for
large companies and flexible voice offers for small companies,

— rural telephony: broadening its traditional coverage and targeting
villages with nearly 20,000 inhabitants,

— increasing the rates set by the regulator to reposition prices,
thereby improving the sales margin.

3.1.5.12 Madagascar

Following the presidential and legislative elections of end-2013, the
country regained a certain degree of political stability and the
international community now recognizes the legitimacy of the
established regime. Accordingly, financial commitments from
international donors multiplied in 2014. However, due to the lack of actual
projects, in particular to renovate and strengthen basic infrastructure
(energy, transport, water, sanitation), financial aid is delayed.

Due to population growth (2.47% in 2014 — source: IMF 2014), GDP
per capita remained stable. Accordingly, the overall telecom services
market did not grow in 2014, due to competition first and foremost
from the purchase of basic necessities.

The mobile penetration rate remained more or less the same as that
of end-2013, i.e. approximately 35% (source: Blycroft). Orange’s total
number of mobile customers saw a sharp increase in 2014 thanks to
the extended radio coverage and strengthened direct and indirect
commercial distribution, both on the consumer and corporate market.
Orange confirmed its leading position in the 3G and 3G+ high-
capacity mobile Internet market and served the 150 major cities of
Madagascar in December 2014.

Furthermore, Orange launched prepaid Internet plans at very
competitive prices in 2014 (for example an entry-level plan at 100
ariary, i.e. 0.03 for 10 megabytes). This, combined with a smartphone
offer of approximately 50 euros, the capacity of an 8,000 km-long
broadband transmission network and the connection to international
Safe and Sat3 cables via the submarine cables LION1 and LION2,
continued to foster the development of mobile Internet.

In the area of Corporate Social Responsibility, Orange Madagascar
continued to install solar panels in rural regions to help reduce CO,

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

emissions related to the generation of electricity for its radio sites. At
the end of 2014, 193 radio sites were powered directly by solar
energy, out of a total of 560 sites.

Lastly, Orange Money continued to grow in 2014, with nearly 1.3 million
customers connected to the service at December 31, 2014, generating
40 million euros in transactions in December (source: Orange).

For the distribution of its services, Orange has a network of 140 stores
and 97 kiosks (local stores), 32 distributors and 20,000 retailers, as
well as 2,000 deposit-withdrawal points for the Orange Money
service.

The priorities for 2015 are as follows:

—developing telecommunication services aimed at businesses and
professionals;

—developing Orange Money services;
—strengthening the indirect distribution network;
—extending mobile coverage in rural areas;
—developing the broadband transmission network;

—launching the 4G LTE service in major cities.

3.1.5.13 Uganda

As part of the regular review and optimization of its asset portfolio,
Orange entered into an agreement in May 2014 with Africell Holding
to sell its majority interest in Orange Uganda, the third largest
telecommunications operator in a highly competitive market. The sale
occurred on November 11, 2014.

3.1.5.14 Central African Republic

Orange was the last of four mobile operators to enter the Central
African market. Almost all of Orange Centrafrique’s mobile customers
use prepaid plans, since very few people in the country have bank
accounts, and wages are low. The growth of the telecommunications
market is still being heavily handicapped by low purchasing power
(compounded by high inflation, particularly for food products) and the
lack of infrastructure, as well as the repercussions of the troubles
experienced by the country in 2013. The mobile penetration rate
remains low, due to the very low population density, which limits
possibilities in terms of network coverage (according to the IMF, the
population was 4.7 million in 2014, i.e. fewer than 8 inhabitants per
km"). Orange Centrafrique nevertheless continues to invest in the
mobile network to enhance its coverage and quality of service. It has
the second most extensive network in the country, with 99 sites (63
sites in 2G and 36 sites in 2G/3G), allowing it to offer mobile services
in 51 towns. At end-2014, Orange Centrafrique had a distribution
network comprising 5 branches (3 in Bangui, 1 in Berbérati and 1 in
Bouar, the branch in Bambari that was temporarily closed for safety
reasons), in addition to 32 distributors and 7,150 resellers across the
country.

3.1.5.15 Guinea Bissau

The mobile market in Guinea Bissau, mainly focused on voice
applications, continues to grow with a penetration rate of approximately
74% (source: GSMA February 2015) in 2014. Orange is the most
recent entrant in a market shared by two operators. With 513,031
active mobile customers at the end of 2014 (+8% compared with
2013) and a market share of 48%, Orange remains second to MTN
in terms of volume, but leads in terms of market share (in value).

Orange Bissau is also the second-largest operator in terms of 2G
coverage and covers the country’s main economic channels linking
Bissau-Ziguinchor to Bissau-Conakry. Orange Bissau successfully
launched a 3G pilot in Bissau and two major cities located inland:
Gabu and Bafata.
Orange Bissau is the Internet market leader and had 1,396 active
Wimax broadband Internet customers at the end of 2014. However,
the development of the Internet is held back by the lack of electrical
energy in the country.

The sales network comprises a few distributors that rely on a network
of semi-wholesalers in the regions.

television offer in August 2013 and invested massively in the content
with more than 1.6 million pounds sterling spent on sports rights. The
BT Openreach division continued to deploy fiber optic services in the
United Kingdom by extending its coverage to 21 million service points
and by connecting 3.4 million households and companies by the end
of September 2014. Whereas all the major broadband ISPs offer fiber
optic connections, BT Retail owns the highest percentage of
connections on the Openreach network with 2.5 million fiber optic
customers at the end of September 2014 (i.e. 34% of its broadband
customer base).

network with nearly 26 directly-owned stores, 20 franchises including
special areas for professional customers, 100 retail outlets that have
been awarded labels, 900 other retail outlets and 17,000 recharging

addition of an extra bandwidth of 10 Gbits/s, while securing
international links and improving the quality of service provided to
Orange Tunisie customers.

2014 was also significant for several major developments in the
network’s core architectures and service platforms. These
architectures, both scalable and secure, will allow to launch innovative
promotions, offers and services.

In 2015, Orange Tunisie aims to continue its mobile growth strategy
by launching offers developing paid uses, and to maintain its leading
position on the 3G market.

with security problems affecting the expenditure and consumption of
Iraqi citizens. However, the company continued to expand throughout
the country, extending network and sales coverage, and in
December 2014 it reached 6.2 million customers.

3.1.7.1

The Orange Group operates under the brand name Orange Business
Services (OBS), both in France and internationally, in the Business
communication and IT services markets. This market is part of the
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector, which
includes technologies used to process and send information.
Worldwide this market represented approximately 1,150 billion euros
in 2014, with telecommunications accounting for slightly less than
40% of this total:

Orange Business Services offers a range of services to large
corporates, local authorities and SMEs in France, as well as to
multinationals around the world, supporting the implementation of
their communication projects. To do so, OBS offers a full range of
fixed-line (voice and data) and IT services.

Worldwide, the year 2014 is characterized by a slight return to growth
(0.4%) in the business markets, with the decrease in connectivity services
(voice and data, fixed and mobile) offset by the growth in IT services:

—the connectivity market dropped at a greater speed (approximately
2%) in 2014. The decline in voice markets (fixed and mobile) and in
data on a historical basis is only partially offset by the demand for
IP VPN networks, broadband and high-capacity broadband
networks, and mobile data;

—the IT services market has increased by nearly 2%, thanks to
outsourcing services (2.5% growth), combined with consulting and
integration services (2% growth). Equipment and software support
services remained stable.

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

In France, the continued decline in fixed-line and mobile voice markets,
together with the erosion in the fixed-line data market, were only partially
offset by the (strong) growth in the mobile data market and the (weak)
growth in the IT services market:

—the enterprise network services market continued to decrease at a
steady pace (5%). The fixed voice market decreased significantly,
due to the lower number of accesses, the erosion of prices and
substitution by other methods of communication (mobile telephony,
unified communications and email). The data market continues to
decline: the growth in broadband and high-capacity broadband
markets does not offset the downward trend in leased lines and
business legacy networks, or the decline in mature IP-VPN
networks;

—the IT services market resumed growth of 0.6% in 2014. This
recovery is due to the upturn in the consulting and integration
services market (+1%), whereas outsourcing, a driver of growth
worldwide, showed only modest growth in France (0.5%). The
support services did not benefit from this upturn, but fell slightly.

In terms of the business market, the major trends are as follows:

—the boundaries between telecom operators and integrators are
blurring due to the commoditization of networks and the convergence
towards IP: operators are offering advanced communication services
that are increasingly integrated into businesses’ information systems,
and are entering into direct competition with IP integrators and Internet
companies. At the same time, Internet companies are enhancing their
services with network solutions to take advantage of the rise in new
usages such as Cloud Computing;

—confronted with new mobility-related usages within businesses (like
BYOD, or Bring Your Own Device), both operators and integrators
are updating their services line-up to meet customers’ needs for
administration, data security, applications, and value-added services;

—regional expansion is another growth driver in emerging countries
(BT’s Prosperity Plan for Asia and Latin America, and Telefonica’s
large presence in Brazil, or Vodafone’s substantial investments in
America, Asia and Africa);

—lastly, companies may turn to acquisitions and partnerships to
speed up their transition to new economic models.

3.1.7.2 Competitive environment
Orange’s main competitors on the market are:
—telecommunications operators:

— SFR Business Team, which offers a range of fixed, mobile and
Internet solutions for businesses, will now operate in tandem with
Completel, since SFR was taken over by Altice/Numericable,

— alternative local loop operators like Colt, that can target French
companies as well as multinationals,

— global telecom service operators, such as BT Global Services,
Verizon Business, AT&T Business Services, and T-Systems,
which offer global distributed services for multinational companies.
In addition to their international services, these operators can
also carry local and national calls by using the Orange network’s
interconnection services,

— global operators from emerging countries (like Tata Communications,
Reliance, and China Telecom) that set up hybrid solutions based
on their own networks and combined with third-party operators’
solutions that they manage themselves,

incumbent operators in some countries;
—network integrators and managed service providers with which
Orange works in “coopetition” (a combination of cooperation and
competition) — especially for companies that use a multi-provider
approach such as Spie Communication and Dimension Data (which
will likely become even stronger in France with the planned takeover
of NextiraOne France in mid-2015);

—major players like IBM Global Services, HP Enterprise Services,
Atos, Cap Gemini and Sopra-Steria (whose merger is effective from
end-2014), that support companies through their IT transformation
projects; the main service categories in which these companies are
positioned include network integration, infrastructure management,
outsourcing, third-party application maintenance (TPAM),
consulting, and engineering;

—Internet companies or niche market specialists that offer VoIP,
messaging, and Cloud Computing services: Microsoft-Skype,
Amazon Web Services, Google or Salesforce.com globally, and
OVH in France;

—major software suppliers that offer their applications online as
services, like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP.

Distribution, operations and partnerships

The market comprising professionals, small companies and SMEs is
managed by a country-wide commercial branch network which, via
sales personnel dedicated to a portfolio of customers and a network
of telephone advisers, provide customers with information on offers,
order status, service quality and incident resolution.

In the large corporate accounts market, Orange Business Services
canvasses, advises and supports its customers providing a range of
solutions and competencies to assist them in their development in
France and worldwide. These customers are covered by sector-
specific Key Customers departments that provide dedicated sales
teams for pre-sales, sales and services. These teams work in close
collaboration with customers to ensure Orange Business Services
represents a reliable partner in their digital transformation. They also
promote partnership-based approaches. Lastly, companies can
manage their contracts and place orders in real time using the Orange
website.

Orange Business Services also relies on international partners to
supplement its offer and geographical coverage in areas where its
customers operate and where its presence does not offer a
comprehensive solution. Orange Business Services is working to build
this type of partnership in the most developed markets, preferably
with the leading operator or its direct competitor, like NTT Communications
in Japan.

Overview of the group s business
Overview of business

The Customer Service & Operations Division (CSO) is responsible for
the production and maintenance of solutions worldwide. Backed by
its geographical reach, the CSO supports customers in managing the
rollout of their network and IT projects and in the daily operation of
their services, including on-site call-outs. In some countries, CSO uses
local partners for local rollouts and to supply equipment. CSO
structures its operations using standardized processes and tools in
order to monitor and support its customers round the clock: two
Customer Service Units (CSU) for French customers, and five Major
Service Centers (MSC) located in India, Egypt, Brazil, Mauritius and
France serving international customers. This system, together with
network redundancy, ensures service continuity for customers,
especially in the case of exceptional events (natural disasters, political
events, or a problem with submarine cables).

Orange Business Services works in close cooperation and bilaterally
with major technology players, such as Cisco, Microsoft, Alcatel-
Lucent, EMC, Avaya, Juniper, Polycom, Netapp, VMWare and Genesys,
or with members of the mobile industry, such as Samsung, Apple and
Blackberry. Orange Business Services also forms partnerships with
service companies, such as Akamai, GFI or Accenture, to develop a
joint sales approach and offer innovative solutions to its customers.

2015 Outlook

In 2015, Orange Business Services will continue to evolve, focusing
on increasing international sales, simplifying processes, optimizing
performance and enriching the digital customer experience.

3.1.8 International Carriers & Shared Services
3.1.8.1 International Carriers
The market

The global international voice market was estimated at 560 billion
minutes in 2014. Its growth is being driven by the economic development
of areas with high geographical density: (principally South-East Asia,
China and India), the development in mobile telephony (in particular
in Africa), and the development of VoIP.

The wholesale of voice and data traffic as well as the provision of
transmission means accounted for approximately 69% of the global
international voice market in 2014 and was estimated at 389 billion
minutes (source: Telegeography 2014).

There were 1,140 operators in the mobile market in 236 countries
(source: GSM Association), including 331 open commercial 4G/LTE
networks in 112 countries (source: GSA September 2014).

The Competitive Environment

Wholesale operators can be divided into three types — global
wholesalers, multinational retail operators and regional or specialist
players:

BICS and iBasis are the main global wholesalers;

—multinational retail operators aim to optimize their end customers’
traffic and generate revenues and earnings in addition to those from
their retail traffic. Orange, Vodafone, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom,
Telia Sonera, and Verizon are among the main ones;

—lastly, regional and specialist players that focus on a particular
geographic area or offer voice or data services. They generally offer
high-quality services at highly competitive rates. These primarily
include Interoute, Primus, Citic, and Calltrade.

The wholesale market’s customer base comprises voice market
specialists (call-shop, prepaid cards), domestic retail carriers (including
MVNOs), and Internet Service Providers. International carriers also sell
wholesale traffic to each other.

International carriers activity

Orange’s International Carriers activity is based on a major long-
distance network infrastructure and offers a broad range of solutions
on the international market.

Its presence in both the retail and wholesale markets means it can
develop wholesale solutions that are particularly well adapted to the
needs of the retail operators. Orange has more than 1,000 customers,
which include fixed-line and mobile operators and Internet access and
content providers.

The Orange Group is unique in that it is very involved in the design,
construction and operation of submarine cables. With its ownership
or co-ownership of several submarine cable systems, the Group ranks
among the world’s largest owners of submarine lines. This has
enabled it to satisfy the increase in transatlantic traffic.

—a seamless global network and an IPX protocol network supporting
voice and data with presence points around the world;

—a global network of dedicated IP routes with end users in more than
220 countries, connections to more than 200 Internet service
providers, and connectivity in over 100 countries in a single IP
network hop (Autonomous System _);

—99.99% network availability, 24/7 centralized network supervision.

The volume of voice traffic in the International Carriers business grew
5.3% in 2014, and there was also a sustained increase in data traffic.

of six cable-laying vessels. It is thus able to supply all laying, landing
end, and maintenance services for cables.

3.1.8.2 Shared services

Orange has developed new growth activities related to its core
business line, such as content broadcasting, audience and
advertising, and healthcare activities.

Content rights

Orange is mainly focused on its role of aggregating content with its
partners to offer increasingly attractive services, in line with its strategy
based on developing partnerships.

The Group is developing new services in France for its customers with
a focus on multi-screen, interactivity and on-demand programs. In
2014, Orange launched its Polaris project, which offers a new
interface and unified services on all screens, in a clear and intuitive
universe. It was rolled out on TV decoders from November 2014 and
until early 2015. In order to supplement its VoD offer, Orange launched
Electronic Sell-Through (definitive download of videos for storage) in
February 2014, offering a wide variety of videos as early releases.

This strategy was also deployed in other countries, such as Poland,
Spain, the United Kingdom, Romania, Belgium, Slovakia, Mauritius,
Senegal and the Ivory Coast. In the United Kingdom, EE —- the
subsidiary of Orange — launched new and innovative multi-screen TV
services.

For music, in France, Orange signed a partnership with Deezer in
2010. The year 2014 was significant for the high growth in the number
of subscribers and users. The service is now available in four countries
in Europe (France, England, Romania and Spain).

In gaming, Orange’s strategy is based on multi-platform distribution
(PC, mobile, tablets, and TV) in partnership with the leading video
game publishers (EA, Ubisoft and Disney). In 2014, Orange continued
its mobile development in the AMEA region and its PC development
in South America with Starmedia (Orange Horizon). Cloud Gaming
continued its development in France with new publishers (Warner,
SquareEnix and Gameloft), which enriched the offer. A Jeux Famille
(family games) pass was launched at the end of 2014 with 150 games
for unlimited enjoyment.

Lastly, the content services helped to promote 4G offers and value-
added Internet access offers.

Viaccess Orca

Viaccess Orca, a subsidiary of Orange, presents innovative solutions
enabling distributors of digital content (pay TV, video on demand) to
monetize premium content and the user experience in a multi-network
and multi-screen environment. Its portfolio includes the protection of
content rights, service platforms, and user commitment management
solutions (introductory and recommended content solutions).
Health

An aging population, an increase in the number of people losing their
independence and the number of patients suffering from chronic
illnesses, coupled with a decrease in the number of doctors and
medical desertification in rural areas make it all the more necessary
for health professionals to turn to information and communication
technologies. They help increase the efficiency of health professionals,
reduce costs, improve illness management and strengthen the
relationship between doctor and patient. Digital services also provide
secure data access and transmission. Orange was the first
telecommunications operator in France to be approved as a personal
health data host.

Orange Healthcare, the Group’s Healthcare Division, draws on its
know-how to develop a variety of services such as:

—“Connected Hospital, Flexible Computing” services and shared
medical imaging systems that allow hospitals, clinics and doctors’
offices share vital patient information. Thanks to these services,
healthcare establishments can better coordinate their activities,
collaborate more efficiently, and transfer data seamlessly;

Overview of the group s business
Network and real estate

—remote health management services, aimed at improving health
conditions outside of traditional healthcare facilities, for example at
home, and aimed at enabling patients to remain in contact with
health professionals, for example through the tele-monitoring of
patients with diabetes, or through tele-observation to treat patients
suffering from respiratory disorders during the night, via our new
Connected Health Center solution;

—services to facilitate prevention and daily well-being, via
permanently accessible IT tools. These offers are the result of the
integration of services developed in partnership with major
healthcare industry companies, and rely on the expertise of the
Orange Labs. These offers are provided mainly in emerging
countries, and involve call centers and epidemiological data
transmission services.

In addition, Orange has joined the French government and major
industry partners in the Silver Economy initiative, which looks to meet
the challenges presented by France’s ageing population through
innovative digital solutions.

3.2 Network and real estate

3.2.1 Network

3.2.1.1

At the end of 2014, Orange operated networks in almost 30 countries
to serve its customers in the consumer market and in approximately
200 countries or territories to serve its business customers.

Overview

Orange’s ambition is to achieve the convergence of its fixed-line and
mobile networks through a unified architecture in accordance with
three fundamental principles:

—flexibility and responsiveness, to quickly assemble and deliver new
services to meet market requirements;

—the ability to support the strong growth and diversification of the
services offered: voice services, Internet access services, video
services, data services;

—simplicity for customers in the use of these services.
The network architecture is broken down into:
—access networks (fixed or mobile);

—aggregation networks;

—domestic and international backbones.

3.2.1.2 Fixed access networks

Analog access and ADSL broadband access

Orange is a copper access network operator in France, Poland and
various countries in Africa (lvory Coast, Senegal, Mauritius, Jordan
and Vanuatu).

Analog access services are provided to more than 10 million
customers in these countries.

Broadband ADSL access (for voice applications, Internet access and
television) was available at the end of 2014:

—in France and in Poland with cover approaching 100% on the
incumbent local loop;

—in AMEA countries where Orange is the operator on the copper
local loop;

—in other countries (for example Egypt, Spain and Slovakia), using
the local loop of the incumbent operators, whether unbundled or
via bitstream-type offers.

FTTx very-high Bandwidth Access

FTTx fiber optic access can extend the available broadband ADSL
service offer to include upstream and downstream high-capacity
bandwidth (of 100 Mbits/s and more), with improved response time.

In France, Orange has for several years been deploying point-to-
multipoint FTTH architecture that uses GPON technology, which can
pool several very high bandwidth accesses on a single fiber without
affecting each access point’s capacity for increasing speed.

FTTH roll-out started in 2007 in several major French cities (Paris and
the Hauts-de-Seine, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Poitiers, Toulouse). It was
then expanded to other large cities. During the years 2011 and 2012,
Orange entered into pooling agreements with other telecoms
operators to speed fiber rollout. At the end of 2014, the Orange fiber
network extended to 350 towns and cities and almost one-third of
homes in France. Fiber is now available to 2.3 million households, and
the number of subscribers to the service is over 480,000.

Overview of the group s business
Network and real estate

In June 2012 Orange announced its FTTH rollout project for Spain,
which aims to connect 1.5 million households. This project represents
an investment of 300 million euros until 2016. 800,000 households were
connected at the end of 2014. A Fiber To The Home (FTTH) network
was also rolled out in Slovakia, connecting 62,189 households at end-
2014, and a pilot FTTx network is being deployed in Poland.

Fixed Radio Access

In a number of different countries, fixed-line services are available
through UMTS, Wimax (Romania and Africa), and CDMA (Poland and
Senegal) radio access.

3.2.1.3

The GSM (2G), UMTS (3G) and LTE (4G) access networks support
faster data and voice communication services of up to several Mbits/s
that can be used to send and receive large files (audio, photo and
video).

2014 was marked by:

Broadband mobile access networks

—the continued roll-out of 3G/3G+ networks in the AMEA region,
together with the first technical and commercial tests performed on
4G technology in a few AMEA countries;

—the continued roll-out of 4G networks in Europe, by increasing the
4G coverage of the population in countries where this service has
already been launched, and by launching this service in Poland and
Slovakia during 2014;

—the test and roll-out of LTE-Advanced (4G+) technology, intended
for commercial use in 2014 (for example in France) or during 2015.

3.2.1.4 Aggregation networks

Aggregation networks concentrate fixed and mobile traffic to the
network core. These networks are traditionally made up of SDH/PDH
technologies for mobiles and ATM technology for fixed aggregation,
and are now evolving towards all-IP networks.

All-IP technologies, such as Gigabit Ethernet, hybrid packet-circuit
microwaves and leased Ethernet lines, continued to be rolled out in
2014. These technologies are used to optimize costs. They are also
used to prepare for future replacement of ATM technology by layer-2
Ethernet technologies and layer-3 IP/MPLS technologies, which can
increase the volume of data sent over fixed and mobile networks.

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

3.2.1.5 Transmission networks

Domestic Networks

This infrastructure is primarily made up of optical fibers, but it also
contains microwave links, especially for alternative or purely mobile
networks.

Optical links offer a bandwidth of up to 100 Gbits/s per wavelength,
and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing technology (DWDM)
makes it possible to have 80 wavelengths per fiber. Orange is one of
the world leaders in the use of advanced optical functions in order to
have a more flexible transmission network. For example, the first of
its kind worldwide, it deployed a 400 Gbits/s per wavelength optical
link between Paris and Lyon in 2013.

Furthermore, Orange offers direct connections by optical fiber to
business customers, providing them with very high bandwidth
services.

Wide Long-Distance Domestic Optical Network
(WELDON) in France

Rollout of the WELDON network (WidE Long distance Domestic
Optical Network) began in April 2012 and aims to upgrade the entire
existing long-distance network, while extending its scope to serve
Frankfurt, London, Barcelona and Madrid, submarine cable stations,
and other areas neighboring France as needed in future.

WELDON uses the latest WDM technology and offers enhanced
connectivity at speeds of at least 100 Gbits/s per wavelength.

International Transmission Network

The international network is based on three networks: the European
Express Network (EEN), connecting 27 points of presence in 16 of
Europe’s largest cities (five of which are in France), on the North
American Backbone network interconnected with the two TAT-14
transatlantic cables for Internet traffic, and on the Asian Backbone
Network in Singapore.

Satellites

Satellite communications are used by Orange to support global
network connections for the French overseas territories, IP or voice
connectivity with other carriers, and VSAT (Very Small Aperture
Terminal) services for Orange Business Services terrestrial or maritime
corporate customers. To provide those services, Orange purchases
space segment from satellite operators (such as Eutelsat, Intelsat,
SES, Arabsat and Spacecom).

Submarine Cables

In order to accommodate the increase in international telecommunications
traffic, Orange has invested in a number of submarine cables through:

— participation in a consortium to build a cable that Orange will co-own;

—purchase of usage rights or transmission capacity leasing on other
cables.

As with terrestrial networks, higher speeds systems on submarine
cables are being implemented and 40 Gbits/s systems are already
operational on several cables within the Orange Group.

Orange to support growth in traffic on the Europe-Asia route.

In the longer term, Orange announced in 2014 its stake in the SEA-ME-
WE5 consortium, a cable linking Singapore to Europe, with connectivity
towards the Indian Ocean. Thanks to the use of 100 Gbits/s
technology, Orange will be able to increase the speed on the Asia-Europe
route and offer new connectivity via Djibouti for Reunion and Mayotte.

Indian Ocean

Orange is a co-owner of the LION (Lower Indian Ocean Network)
cables connecting Madagascar to the global broadband network via
Reunion and Mauritius, and LION2, the LION extension to Kenya
serving Mayotte. To meet the sustained growth in traffic, the Group
has invested in a capacity upgrade of both LION and LION2, which
was operational at the end of 2013.

Atlantic Ocean

Orange is also active in the Caribbean where it has capacity on three
major cables: Americas-ll, ECFS, and CBUS. The Group took part in
a capacity increase on the Americas-ll and CBUS cables, to support
the surge in broadband use in France’s overseas departments. The
additional capacity was delivered in 2013. Orange plans to make the
necessary investments to further increase its capacity on these cables
in the second half of 2015.

The International Voice Network
Voice Network

Orange has three international switching nodes in France (CTI 4G) to
manage traffic to and from France in the fixed-line and mobile markets
(TDM) for consumers, businesses and operators, and to centralize the
transfer of international traffic for its subsidiaries. These exchanges
have developed into hybrid NGN nodes to carry Voice over IP (VoIP)
traffic. The architecture of the international voice network underwent
a major change in 2013 with the installation of five softswitches
dedicated to Voice over IP (VoIP) to achieve the target of reaching
65% of Orange’s international voice traffic carried by VoIP by the end
of 2015.

3.2.1.6 IP Transport Networks

The International IP Network

Orange international IP Transit network, known as Open Transit
Internet (OTI), aims to provide global Internet connectivity to Group
subsidiaries’ domestic IP networks, operator customers, Internet
service providers (ISP) and content providers. It is based on the latest
IP transmission and switching technologies.

As of end-2014, the OTI connected 23 cities (12 in Europe, 2 in Asia,
8 in North America and 1 in Africa) through broadband connections
at speeds of 155 Mbits/s to 100 Gbits/s, with several hundred Gbits/s
of traffic at peak times. Traffic hit 2.9 Tbits at end-2014.

Outside France, Orange has two softswitches in the United States
and a media gateway in Hong Kong to meet the needs of customers
and operators in America and Asia via TDM or VoIP.

Signaling Network

Signaling system 7 (SS7) on the international network is managed by
two Signal Transfer Points (STP), which support the signaling
associated with voice traffic, roaming and SMS for Orange’s mobile
operator customers and the majority of its mobile subsidiaries. A
growing number of links serving the largest roaming and SMS
customers are supported by SIGTRAN signaling over IP.

Several centralized platforms have been rolled out on the international
transit points to provide value-added services to mobile operators.
3.2.1.8 Networks dedicated
to business services

X.25 networks

X.25 was taken off the market in mid-2010 and the technical aspects
of the service were discontinued in June 2012.

However, X.25 still serves as a connection network in France and its
overseas territories for several thousand payment points, connected
with “intelligent network” services. Since the reintegration of this
“intelligent network” function into an IP network is not expected before
2015, the X.25 network will be retained until then.

Frame Relay /ATM Networks

In France, the Frame Relay/ATM network is an access network used
to support both business (particularly through the TDSL aggregation
offers) and a layer 3 (X.25 and IP) services. It has been deployed in
around 150 points of presence in mainland France, in the five
overseas departments and in two overseas territories (New Caledonia
and French Polynesia).

The activity on the FR/ATM network is declining, and businesses’
need for increased speed is increasingly met by the IP/MPLS services
available on the “Network for Business Access to IP” (RAEI).

Outside France, the AGN network (ATM Global Network) covers 1,000
points in approximately 200 countries. It supports X.25, Frame Relay
or ATM services. However, as in France, it is mainly used today as an
access network to IP services, because of its extensive worldwide
footprint. It also provides a transport function for the IP network, but
this function is diminishing as the native IP network develops.

The Network for Business Access to IP (RAEI) in France

The main purpose of the RAEI is to connect a company’s sites for
internal data exchange on the Virtual Private Network (VPN) and to
provide it with Internet connectivity. It also provides Voice over IP
transport for companies.

It is made up of a core infrastructure of around 60 transit routers that
are interconnected by multiple 10 Gbits/s links, or 100 Gbits/s links.
This backbone network also provides the interconnection with the
Backbone and IP Aggregation Network (RBCIl) for Internet traffic and
for business aggregation traffic coming from NAS and BAS.

3.2.2 Real estate

At December 31, 2014, the real estate assets recorded in Orange’s
balance sheet had a net book value of 2.8 billion euros, compared
with 2.9 billion euros in 2013.

These assets include buildings used to host telecommunication
equipment, research centers, customer service centers, commercial
facilities and offices.

In France, the Real Estate Division is responsible for managing all
properties. It follows a policy that involves optimizing the occupation
of surface within premises by constantly adapting to the changing
needs expressed by the Group’s various entities and business lines.
It is involved in the deployment of new stores within the distribution
network, especially for very large stores. It also works to meet needs
related to changes in the telecommunications network by making sure
that the necessary sites are available for launching new technologies.

Overview of the group s business
Network and real estate

In addition, a ring of approximately 700 PE (Provider Edge) routers
gives companies access to xDSL and Ethernet technologies, at
speeds of 75 Kbits/s to 1 Gbits/s, under standard offers. The routers
are located in major cities and business areas.

This network is connected to the IP Global Network through four
gateways (located in Paris, Lille and Lyon) to connect international
business customers.

With the takeover of the RTGE network, the number of IP presence
points increased with 100 new sites added in 2014.

The international MPLS _ /IP VPN network
(IP Global Network IGN and AGN access network)

Like the IP network in France (RAEI), this network is designed to
supply Virtual Private Network (VPN), Internet and Voice over IP
services. At the end of October 2014, the network comprised 844
points of presence (including partner MPLS networks) across 165
countries. Direct presence in the countries decreased (190 countries
in 2013) as Orange is developing a partnership strategy (Network to
Network Interface or NNI) in order to cover certain regions and
countries more effectively.

The network is made up of dozens of network core routers (P routers
and similar) and several hundred access routers (PE routers) that
make up multiservice platforms (Ethernet, DSL, FR/ATM). The services
are offered either directly on the access routers, through the Frame
Relay/ATM access network (AGN), or through partner networks under
NNI agreements.

A program to expand the geographic coverage of the IGN (IGN+)
network was launched to eventually offer “native IP” services
everywhere and thus do away with the AGN aggregation layer.

The international business voice network (NEO)

NEO is a network supplying voice services for international businesses.
Based on the international MPLS IP network (IGN), this business voice
network has 59 points of presence in 39 countries, and is connected
to some 50 operators worldwide. It allows calls to be aggregated and
terminated with these operators, for customers connected to the
Orange Business Services network over IP (H323 or SIP) or TDM.

The Real Estate Division contributes to improve Group employees’
working environment-in line with the Conquest 2015 objectives-and
enhance the environmental performance of the Group’s properties in
order to help it meet its sustainable development goals.

At end-2014, Orange occupied 25,450 sites (including 225 with a
surface area greater than 5,000 sq.m.), covering a total area of
5.7 million sq.m., including 2.2 million sq.m. of leased space and
3.5 million sq.m. of fully-owned space. These premises consist of
technical centers, most of which are fully owned (2.6 million sq.m.,
including 2.1 million sq.m. owned), offices, most of which are leased
(2.3 million sq.m., including 1.3 million sq.m. leased), and stores, most
of which are leased (81,027 sq.m., including 73,900 sq.m. leased).

In Poland, the properties held by Orange Poland at the end of 2014
represented 1.9 million sq.m. The total surface area of developed and
undeveloped land represented 13.7 million sq.m.

3.3 Research and innovation, patents and licenses

3.3.1 Research and innovation

The information and communication technology (ICT) sector in recent
years has gone through major changes in its value chain, significantly
increasing the number of players. New economic models developed
by large Web players are coming into existence, while manufacturers
of consumer electronics are moving towards value-added services.
In this context, innovation will be a major source of growth for Orange.
In 2014, Orange continued its efforts in research and innovation and
devoted 1.9% of its revenues, or 732 million euros, to it. These expenses
totaled 780 million euros in 2013 and 812 million euros in 2012. These
amounts include employee costs, operating and investment costs for
research and innovation in new products and services.

Research and Innovation Network

In order to achieve its goals in research and innovation, Orange has
established a network of expertise spanning four continents.

The Orange Labs carry out the Group’s technical research, design
and deployment activities from their locations in nine countries around
the world: France, the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Poland,
Romania, Tunisia, India, and Egypt. Each Orange Lab is immersed in
a specific environment that enables it to anticipate and take advantage
of technological breakthroughs and changes in user patterns
worldwide and to facilitate partnerships, thereby accelerating the
Group’s capacity for innovation.

The Orange Labs network is supplemented by so-called Technocentres,
located in France, the United Kingdom, Poland, Jordan, and the Ivory
Coast. Their objective is to design and market new products and
services that meet customer requirements as far as possible in all the
countries where the Group is present. They are also tasked with
ensuring consistent user interfaces for the Group’s various products
and services (design strategy).

Open innovation

Since 2013, Orange has strengthened its open innovation strategy
based on sharing and collaboration. The main pillars of this approach are:

—Supporting start-ups and SMEs. Orange launched a start-up
accelerator initiative, known as Orange Fab . Created in March 2013
in Silicon Valley, it was later expanded to France and then to South
East Asia (Japan in November of that year, followed by South Korea
and Taiwan in April 2014). In 2014, the Orange Fab initiative was
implemented in Poland (February), lvory Coast (September) and
Israel (September). Orange also partnered with Oasis 500 to launch
an accelerator in Jordan in November 2014. Orange Fab provides
guidance and support to selected start-ups, in addition to financial
and logistical support. In order to foster the growth of these start-
ups, Orange and Deutsche Telekom announced (in June 2014) their
collaboration on their respective Orange Fab and hub: raum
acceleration programs. The partnership with NUMA (space
dedicated to innovation and digital technology, launched in Paris in
2013 with Orange as a founding member) is also part of this
initiative. The Group is a also a member of two tech-industry co-
working spaces, bringing together innovators and entrepreneurs
(scientists, engineers, developers, ergonomics experts and
designers) from a wide variety of backgrounds (start-ups, large
companies, SMEs, universities).

—The Orange Partner program, as part of which Orange opens its
service platforms to developers to provide more innovative services
to its customers. In 2014, Orange provided seven Application

Orange / 2014 Registration Document

Programming Interfaces (API) for its core services in self-service
mode: Identity, User details, SearchToptrends, Orange WiFi Locator,
Orange Store Locator, Cloud and M2M.

—A major player in the research and innovation ecosystem. Orange
is a key player in research programs through various partnerships,
at both the French level (FU! and ANR projects, and “Future
Investments Program”) and at the European level (seventh
European Commission Framework Program, EUREKA-CELTIC,
Horizon 2020). As part of the “Future Investments Program”, the
Group is a member of two Technology Research Institutes and
chairs the B-com Technology Research Institute, which works on
ultra-high-speed broadband fixed-line and mobile networks and the
content of the future. It also contributes to the System X institute,
which works in the area of digital systems engineering. In France,
Orange participates in ten competitiveness centers in France, set
up to foster local synergies for innovative projects. Notably, it chairs
the Images et R seaux (Image and Networks) center, where it is
the lead for the augmented reality plan. Orange plays a role in
several plans in the nouvelle France industrielle program, unveiled
by the French government in September 2013 to accelerate
developments in research and innovation.

—A policy of strategic partnerships with universities and academic
institutes in France (including Institut Mines-Télécom, CNRS, INRIA,
Université de Rennes 1 and Supélec) and abroad (for example with
LIRIMA in Yaoundé in Cameroon). The Orange group is also
financing several Research Chairs. Lastly, Orange has an active
policy of forming strategic partnerships with leading industrial
players worldwide, which allows it to enhance its portfolio of
products and services and open itself to new ecosystems.

Private Equity

Orange plays a key role in financing innovation in the IT industry,
notably through investments in the following three types of vehicles:

—mono-corporate ventures (fully-owned investment companies) such as:

— French holding companies Orange Capital (OC) and Orange
Capital Management (OCM), and the Chinese Orange Venture
Capital Investment (OVCl) fund,

— French holding company Orange Technologies Investissements
(OTI), initially established to monetize Orange’s intellectual
property in exchange for stakes in high-tech start-ups;

—multi-corporate ventures (joint investment companies), typically set
up with other industrial companies but occasionally also involving
financial firms. These multi-corporate ventures include:

— three Orange Publicis Ventures funds (Growth, Global, and Early-
stage) set up through a partnership with Publicis and managed
by Iris Capital Management, and in which the Group purchased
a 24.5% stake,

— the Ecomobilité Ventures fund set up with SNCF and Total,

— the Technocom 2 fund, financed jointly with Alcatel-Lucent, SEB,
Soitec, and France’s National Seed Money Fund (Fonds National
d Amor age ) and managed by Innovacom Gestion,

— the Robolution Capital fund, financed jointly by BPI France, the
European Investment Fund, EDF and Thalés, and managed by
the Orkos Capital management company;
—more traditional private equity funds attracting a wide range of
investors (financial and non-financial companies as well as retail
investors) and managed by independent asset management firms
in Europe, the United States and Canada.

Research areas

Orange is engaged in research in a number of areas to prepare for
the future:

—5G networks: Orange is making an active contribution to European
research aimed at defining the solutions, architectures, technologies
and standards to be implemented in preparation for the future 5G
