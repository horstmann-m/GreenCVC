MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

TO THE COMBINED GENERAL

MEETING OF 16 MAY 2018

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in force, the Management Board has convened you here in order to inform you on the
management of your company and its subsidiaries and to submit for your approval the financial statements for the year ended

31 December 2017.

Somfy is the global leader in opening and closing automation for both residential and commercial buildings, and a key player in the

connected home.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE

There were no major changes in the consolidation scope over the
2017 financial year.

Myfox and iHome, acquired in late 2016, contributed €11.1 million
and €1.5 million respectively to Group sales.

The allocation of the acquisition cost of Myfox was finalised in late
2017.

TAX ITEMS

Following regulatory developments in France, Somfy SA has filed
requests for tax relief primarily involving taxation on the portion of
fees and charges applied to dividends and capital gains on the sale
of equity investments, as well as on the 3% contribution on
distributions of dividends.

The financial statements at 31 December 2017 include €22.3
million in tax income, including €17.7 million in respect of the 3%
contribution on dividends and €4.4 million in respect of taxation on
the portion of fees and charges (relating to the dividends and
long-term capital gains on the sale of equity investments).

€20 million in rebates was received over the financial year in this
regard.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The dispute between Spirel employees and Somfy SA is still
ongoing before the Albertville District Court. The employees seek
annulment of the transfer of the Spirel securities, which took place
in 2010, and to have Somfy SA ordered to pay them damages for
the alleged deliberate bankruptcy of Spirel and non-material
damage caused as a result of the anxiety, disappointment and
vexation they deem to have been victim of, for a total of
approximately €8.2 million. In April 2017, the Court ruled in favour
of Somfy SA, dismissing the employees’ claims. However, the
plaintiffs immediately appealed this decision.

Moreover, during 2016, the liquidator of the company Spirel also
sought to have Somfy SA ordered to refund advances of €2.9
million paid by the AGS (Guarantee Fund for the payment of salary
claims) in the event the disposal was declared null and void.

Initial proceedings before the Labour Court — involving the
employees contesting the grounds for their dismissal and claiming
damages of a substantially similar amount to that sought before
the District Court — were dismissed in November 2016. The
employees applied to the Albertville Labour Court once again in
early July 2017. The hearings scheduled for early 2018 have been
postponed until July 2018.

These new factors do not change the assessment of risks by the
Group which continues to qualify these risks as contingent
liabilities and therefore no provision in relation to these disputes
was recognised at 31 December 2017.

On 5SJanuary 2015, Somfy SA transferred its 46.1% equity
investment in the share capital of CIAT Group to United
Technologies Corporation. On 31March 2016, United
Technologies Corporation filed a claim against the sellers of the
CIAT shares under the liability guarantee for a total of €28.6 million
(Somfy’s share being €13.2 million). The Group considers these
requests to be unfounded, and insufficiently detailed and justified.
In mid-November 2017, UTC brought an action against the sellers
before the Paris Commercial Court for the liability guarantee. The
hearings are scheduled to take place in 2018.

As the process currently stands, the Group continues to contest
the entirety of UTC’s demands and remains confident regarding
the outcome of this dispute. It has qualified the risk as a
contingent liability and no provision was recognised at
31 December 2017.

At 31 December 2017, Somfy SA’s financial statements include a
deferred settlement receivable in relation to the sale of the CIAT
shares for the sum of €9.7 million with payment spread until 2019.
In early July 2017, Somfy SA and the other sellers brought an
action against UTC before the Paris Commercial Court seeking the
fulfilment of the acquisition contract and the settlement of the

deferred payments falling due. The hearings are also scheduled for
2018. Somfy SA remains confident regarding the settlement of

these sums and therefore no provision in relation to these
receivables was recognised at 31 December 2017.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PARENT COMPANY DATA

Over the year ended 31 December 2017, Somfy SA generated sales
of €3.2 million. Net financial income amounted to €89.1 million,
including €92.5 million in dividends paid by the subsidiaries in
respect of their net profit for the year to 31 December 2016.

Net profit was €107.1 million, after inclusion of an income tax
refund of €25.5 million, including the tax reliefs.

CONSOLIDATED DATA

SALES

Sales increased by 10.1% over the financial year just ended to
€1,246.6 million. They benefitted from a positive scope effect of
€11.2 million and suffered from a negative currency impact of
€12.8 million.

SALES BY CUSTOMER LOCATION

Growth stood at 10.3% on a like-for-like basis over the financial
year, including 8.5% over the first half and 12.3% over the second,
and followed an increase of 10.2% over the course of the previous
year. It reflects significant growth in all business segments and
locations".

The most noteworthy performances came from Asia-Pacific,
America, France, Eastern and Central Europe, and Northern
Europe, all of which recorded double-digit growth.

The trend was less impressive, but nevertheless remained
definitively positive within the two other major regions, Southern
Europe and Germany.

The strong performance of these figures is testament to the
growing interest of consumers in different continents in motorised
and connected solutions in the home, and thereby validates the
Group’s choices and positioning (international coverage,
innovation, digital transformation, etc.).

RESULTS Ultimately, profitability remained at a very satisfactory level with a

Current operating result stood at €168.4 million over the financial
year, down 5.2%, and represented 13.5% of sales (current
operating margin).

This decline resulted from factors that are both cyclical and
structural, namely gaining market share, the rise in the price of raw
materials, fluctuations in the main invoicing currencies and the
integration of recently-acquired companies (iHome Systems,
Myfox).

On a like-for-like basis, current operating result would have been
virtually stable at €178.0 million, and as such would have
represented 14.3% of sales.

Consolidated net profit was €157.7 million, an increase of 10.1%. It
takes into account a negligible net non-recurring operating
expense, a net financial expense of €5.9 million, which mainly
includes unrealised exchange differences, and income tax of €3.1
million, a particularly low level due notably to the recovery of the
tax on dividends.

Excluding tax rebates, net profit would have been €135.4 million,
and would have fallen by 5.5%.

return on capital invested (ROCE) of 19.7%).
Detailed calculations of current operating result and ROCE (IAP) is
detailed in note 4.3 to the consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL POSITION

The balance sheet was further strengthened.

The net cash surplus rose indeed from €15.5 million to €104.6
million year-on-year, an increase of €89.1 million, and
shareholders’ equity grew to €770.7 million.

The net financial debt corresponds to the difference between
financial assets and financial liabilities. Notably it takes into
account unlisted bonds receivable, issued by certain companies in
which shares are held or related entities, earnout on acquisitions,
liabilities relating to options granted to minority shareholders in
fully-consolidated companies and deferred settlements of a
financial nature. Not included are securities in non-controlling
equity investments, deposits & guarantees and government grants.
Net financial debt is detailed in note 7.2.3 to the consolidated
financial statements.

(1) Germany, America, Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe and France are the geographic regions used to monitor
sales. Their sales are calculated based on customer location and therefore the destination of the sales.

(2) Return on capital invested or employed (ROCE) is equal to the ratio between current operating result, after normative tax, and the sum of shareholders’
equity (with the effects of goodwill impairment being neutralised) and the net financial debt.

STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE

During the 2017 financial year, the Somfy SA share price increased by 6.26%. At 30 December 2016, the last trading day before the close of
the previous financial year, the share price was €77.52, compared with €82.37 at 29 December 2017.

Based on this last share price and taking account of a gross dividend per share of €1.30, the Somfy SA share yielded 1.6%.

The market for the share recorded a monthly trading volume high of 177,415 and low of 62,543 per month, with a monthly average of
99,319 shares, compared with 73,598 shares the previous year.

POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENT

EXERCISE OF THE NEOCONTROL CALL OPTION

Somfy exercised its call option on 20 January 2018, and purchased the remaining 39% interest in Neocontrol, in which it previously held a
61% interest, and which was recognised via the equity method at an amount of BRL 2.1 million, i.e. around €0.6 million. Somfy has
therefore taken control of Neocontrol, in which it now holds 100% of the capital, and will now fully consolidate the company.

OUTLOOK

The environment should remain favourable over the short term within the Group’s various business segments and regions, and thus lead to
growth in sales over the course of the current financial year in spite of the high comparison base. Similarly, stabilisation or even a slight
improvement in the current operating margin" will be a possibility given the gradual decline in the factors responsible for last year’s
erosion.

The current financial year will also be marked by the continued roll-out of the new strategic plan (Believe & ACT) to allow the Group to
strengthen its foundation and fully capitalise on the significant potential represented by the move towards the digitalisation of buildings,
the motorisation of interior products and the streamlining of energy consumption.

The development of completely open solutions, illustrated by the interoperability agreements recently concluded with the brands Amazon
Alexa, Apple Homekit, Google Home, Legrand, Schneider Electric and the IFTTT platform, testifies to the Group’s desire to be a key player in
the connected home and a byword for comfort, environmental protection and security in the home.

VALUE OF INTERCOMPANY LOANS GRANTED
(ARTICLE L. 511-63-BIS OF THE MONETARY AND FINANCIAL CODE)

Somfy SA had not granted any intercompany loans at 31 December 2017.

INFORMATION ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SHARE CAPITAL AND HOLDINGS

DIVISION OF THE SHARE PAR VALUE

The Management Board decided on 24 May 2017 to divide the Somfy share par value by five and thereby reduce the said par value from
€1.00 to €0.20, in accordance with the resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of 17 May 2017.

Each of the existing shares was exchanged for five new shares with the same dividend and voting rights on 3 July 2017, the day the new
shares were delivered.

The number of shares comprising the company’s share capital was thus increased from 7,400,000 to 37,000,000 shares with a par value of
€0.20 each (ISIN Code: FRO013199916).

Upon completion of the transaction, double voting rights were allocated to the registered shares resulting from the division of the existing
registered shares that already carried double voting rights.

allocated to all fully paid shares that have been duly registered for
at least four years in the name of the same shareholder at the end
of the calendar year preceding that of each General Meeting.

to a shareholder in exchange for existing shares, which already
benefit from this right, will be entitled to the same double voting
right.

All shares converted into bearer shares or whose ownership has
been transferred shall lose their entitlement to a double voting
right, except in instances provided for by law.”

INFORMATION ON THE BUYBACK OF OWN SHARES

(ARTICLE L. 225-211 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

The company has implemented several successive share buyback

programmes. The most recent buyback programme was launched

in 2017; it was authorised by the Combined General Meeting of

17 May 2017 in its twelfth resolution, sitting in ordinary session,

and had the following objectives:

— to stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the
Somfy share, by way of an investment services provider within a
liquidity contract that complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI
recognised by regulations, it being specified that within this
framework the number of shares considered for the calculation
of the limit specified above corresponds to the number of shares
purchased less the number of shares resold;

— to retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange them
or use them as payment within the framework of potential
acquisitions;

— to ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or
corporate officers of the Group, as well as all other shares
allocated under a company or group savings scheme (or similar),
in relation to employee profit sharing and/or any other form of
allocation to employees and/or corporate officers of the Group;

— to cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of
company shares, in accordance with applicable regulations;

— to proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired,
subject to the authorisation granted by the General Meeting of
shareholders of 24 May 2016 in its eleventh resolution, sitting in
extraordinary session.

Mg SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 I

20

Such share purchases could be effected by all means, including by
means of acquiring blocks of shares and at any times considered
appropriate by the Management Board.

The company reserved the right to use options or derivative
instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

The maximum purchase price was set at €600 per share (i.e. a
restated amount of €120 to take account of the five-for-one par
value split decided by the Management Board on 24 May 2017),
with the maximum amount of the share buyback programme set at
€124,375,800, taking account of the 532,707 treasury shares held
at 31 December 2016.

During the financial year just ended, on the basis of the
authorisations given by the General Meetings of 2016 and 2017,
the company bought back 138,418 shares at an average price of

INFORMATION ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
(ARTICLES L. 232-1 AND L. 233-26 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

The efforts made in the field of research and development were
continued in 2017, in line with the Believe & ACT strategic plan and
following on from major initiatives started in previous years. We
can therefore identify three main development areas: a range of
connected motors that can be controlled remotely online using a
mobile phone or tablet application, solutions to meet new usage
patterns made possible by this connected product range, and
ecosystems combining different Somfy products with each other or
with partner solutions in order to promote the creation of new
high added-value services.
The Group as a whole is beginning to see the results of priority
within R&D efforts being given to connected solutions. A certain
number of important milestones in this area were passed in 2017:
— acceleration of the strategy of openness in terms of protocols;
— change in our development methodology;
— implementation of a connected offer for the Asia & Americas
region.
The implementation of our connected strategy is part of a wider
approach called “So Open”, the Group’s policy of openness
according greater value to seeking partnerships ahead of the
priority historically given to proprietary or semi-open solutions and
business models. Somfy continues to enhance and develop the

21

io-homecontrol protocol (wireless radio communication
technology) with its partners in the io-homecontrol alliance, but
has also decided to integrate the main open protocols on the
market, in particular Zigbee, into its solutions in order to produce a
range dedicated to the Asia & Americas region. This requires
software that makes it possible to connect the Somfy platforms
(TaHoma, Overkiz, Myfox and Somfy alarms) with our partners’
solutions (Sonos, Google, Apple, Amazon Alexa and IFTTT).

This ambition requires a change in our development practices,
which was initiated in 2017 by the Technical Department in
collaboration with the Connected Solutions Activity. The
development of a connected solution, motors and control units
based on a Zigbee protocol enabled the validation of this new
methodological approach. Notable results included the
simultaneous development of the range at four different sites —
Cluses, Annecy, Zhejiang and Hong Kong — over just six months.
This methodology should eventually make it possible to move from
four specific IT frameworks, one for each protocol used, to a single
framework that can be tailored to the various protocols. This will
be possible thanks to the introduction of best practices and
standards in terms of programming. The adaptability and capacity
to reuse, like components, the various modules of any new

MB SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017

programme, will facilitate the interoperability of our ranges and
improve the lifetime of the products via simplified updates.

This methodology will also help to improve design times, facilitate
functional validation and improve quality performance. It will also
help to make ranges more secure in the face of the risk of
cyberattacks.

The first tangible result of this change in our practices is the
availability of a connected two-way offer based on the Zigbee 3.0
open protocol enabling the needs of the Asia & Americas region to
be served. Created in record time, this range was jointly developed
by LianDa and BG Interior. It involved the introduction of a
transversal taskforce between these two entities, as well as
distribution. This latest version 3.0 of Zigbee offers an excellent
level of security and reliability since it works on the principle of a
network meshed between its various points. In addition, it is an
open protocol which will allow the consumer to add other
products within their home.

In terms of organisation, the opening in 2017 of the R&D Centre
based at SOPEM on the Niepolomice site should be highlighted.
The R&D Centre has 17 employees responsible for developing the
EVB (External Venetian Blinds) range. Its location, near Krakow,
Poland, places the team right in the centre of the main markets for
these products: Central and Eastern Europe, outside regions in
which our competitors are located and at the heart of the
production site responsible to industrialising this range.

In the context of the Smart Home, development agility and the
capacity to analyse the data collected are major challenges: the
Connected Solutions Activity has structured itself to meet these
challenges by creating joint project groups between teams, such as
between Overkiz (the subsidiary that develops the Group’s Cloud
solution) and the Smart Home team, in order to accelerate the
market launch of new solutions and product developments. A
team is dedicated to data analysis to anticipate new usage
patterns and invent services tailored to them.

In terms of new products, a certain number of significant launches
took place in 2017.

FOR THE CONNECTED SOLUTIONS ACTIVITY

Launched in May, Somfy One is a great example of successful
collaboration between the Somfy teams and those of Myfox, the
leader in connected security. Since their joining in October 2016,
the Somfy Protect range, offering users a comprehensive and
innovative alarm and video-surveillance ecosystem, has been
created. Somfy One is an “all-in-one” security system which
includes video-surveillance, intruder detection, siren, alarm control
unit and voice control. It is a genuine innovation and received two
awards at CES 2017. From May, the launch of SomfyOne+ ensures
compatibility with TaHoma.

The connected door lock has been completely reworked following
feedback from customers. The overhaul includes the design, in
order to fit into high end doors and improve the perceived quality
of the product, a Somfy Keys application, which acts as a digital
bunch of keys, and lastly a digital keypad door lock.

Some of these new ranges were launched at Consumer trade
shows, which differ greatly from B2B fairs where the Group is
usually present.

Following the acquisition of Myfox, Somfy took part in the CES
(Consumer Electronic Show) for the first time, which was held in
Las Vegas between 5 and 8 January 2017. The Somfy One product
won two Innovation Awards, in the “Smart Home” and “Embedded
Technologies” categories.

Ml SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 I 22

Somfy also took part in the IFA exhibition in Berlin between 1 and
6 September 2017. The leading European trade show for consumer
electronics and home appliances, each year it welcomes more than
1,800 exhibitors who present their latest innovations. Somfy
presented its connected range and unveiled its new connected
thermostat there.

FOR THE HOME & BUILDING ACTIVITY

In May, the first connected motorisation range for pergolas with
adjustable slats was launched. Featuring io-homecontrol
technology, this innovation is the result of the collaboration
between Somfy and WAY. Aimed at both individual and
professional customers (for example restaurant owners), this
range means Somfy can offer a comprehensive ecosystem for
terraces and, in particular, for the luxury solar protection market
which is currently booming.

Maestria 50 WT, a motorisation for vertical exterior screens arrives
on the market with a major innovation: detection of obstacles
when being lowered. An innovation long awaited by customers,
which helps avoid product degradation following handling errors
and ensures optimum user comfort.

A second competitive advantage is its universal motorisation.
Maestria 50 WT adapts to standard screens with track or cord
runners, as well as to zip screens (using the principle of a zipper).
Maestria 50 WT is the seventh product to be awarded the Somfy
environmental label. As such, it is helping to achieve the ambition
of having 60% of volumes sold in 2018 being labelled Act for
Green®. It has a PEP ecopassport’ environmental declaration.

FOR THE ACCESS ACTIVITY

The DEXXO PRO io Connexoon was launched in March. This
motorisation will now enable our customers to sell connected,
rather than just motorised, garage doors. The main benefit of
connectivity is the “geolocation” function allowing users to
manage all home access when they arrive in the vicinity of their
home without doing anything.

The Activity also launched a new motor for the DIY sector, the GDK
700 assembled in Gray.

Gray's factory also launched a new industrial and commercial
closure range for the Simu brand: the veoHz centris. Unique in the
market, this new Simu central motor with integrated radio receiver
is adjusted remotely, from a Simu veoHz radio transmitter.

At BFT, a new actuator motor for swing gates “Giuno Ultra” was
launched. It has been designed to fulfil two major expectations
expressed by customers: having products that are more reliable
and easier to install.

In 2017, the Group successfully renewed its accreditation of the
standard ISO9001: 2015 for the quality management system.
Somfy Activités SA, Somfy GmbH, Domis, SITEM, SOPEM and Simu
SAS have worked together and will collectively implement the
improvement observations and recommendations formally set out
by AFNOR.

The Department of Intellectual Property organised Invent’heure,
an event that brought together 150 Somfy employees and
inventors in Cluses in mid-September to celebrate invention within
the Group, thank the inventors and reiterate the importance that
invention and patents represent for the Group.

Somfy is one of the leading French companies in terms of filing
patents with the National Institute of Intellectual Property (INPI)
and was ranked 39th in 2016. In 2017, the Group filed 43 new
patent applications. The portfolio is made up of 2,066 patents.

A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT POLICY IN LINE
WITH THE GROUP’S STRATEGIC VISION

The world in which we live is rapidly changing. At a time of
digitalisation and home automation, some major challenges lie
ahead for the Group. Somfy Spirit, the Group’s culture, is the solid
foundation allowing the company to meet these challenges while
remaining confident about its collective future. To this end, the
Group relies on its growth model, which for almost 50 years now
has allowed it to grow and to take confident action together with
all its stakeholders. It is based on Independence, Continuity,
Anticipation, and a Global-Local Alliance.

Somfy puts men and women, who act responsibly, at the heart of
the business. The Group depends on a flexible organisation that
constantly adapts to strategic challenges and changes within its
markets.

At Somfy, we are bringing to life our vision of “inspiring a better
way of living accessible to all”, and doing everything in our power
to make it a reality thanks to our initiatives aimed at saving energy,
and improving comfort, wellbeing and safety. That is why today
WE ARE TAKING ACTION.

To achieve its ambition by 2020, in 2017 the Group identified four
major priorities for its strategic roadmap Believe & Act! called
DRIVERS.

WE ARE TAKING ACTION to connect with consumers since we
believe that this close relationship will help us to respond to the
digitalisation of our markets — the CLOSER TO OUR END-USERS
driver.

WE ARE TAKING ACTION with a head start to develop the interior
solutions market since we firmly believe in its high growth
potential and its practical value for users —- the BOLDER ON THE
INTERIOR MARKETS driver.

WE ARE TAKING ACTION to further improve our operational
excellence because we know that our customers need ever more
agility, efficiency and quality in our products — the STRONGER ON
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE driver.

WE ARE TAKING ACTION to promote cooperation and
empowerment in connection with Somfy Spirit because we think
that the development of our employees is vital — the BETTER
TOGETHER driver.

WE BELIEVE in connected homes and buildings and WE ARE
TAKING ACTION for the coming years.

23

Each driver is broken down into several boosters that all Group
employees can adopt. The resolutely human driver Better
Together puts CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) drivers at the
heart of value creation with, amongst other things, the #CSR
booster (Corporate Social Responsibility). Better Together
contributes to employee commitment and serves the long-term
interests of the Group and its stakeholders. This helps the
implementation of Sustainable Development drivers in the Group’s
strategy and operations.

In relation to the Better Together driver, the main levers of the
Group’s entities are to ensure the professional and personal
development of all employees, improve their working environment
and minimise the environmental impact of all activities, sites and
products, and to accept its civic responsibility by becoming
involved in social issues that are consistent with their lines of
business.

These levers are progressively strengthened through an approach
based on continuous improvement measured by indicators, the
introduction of a dialogue with all stakeholders, and regular and
transparent communication.

The Group’s Sustainable Development policy is the declaration of
its corporate identity. It seeks to meet, even surpass the
expectations of its customers and stakeholders, to unite them in a
greater ambition; the achievement of the Group’s vision:
contributing to better living environments for all, not only in terms
of comfort but also energy savings and security.

GOVERNANCE

The Steering Committee for Sustainable Development. brings
together the Sustainable Development Director, the Human
Resources Director and the Communications Director. Its mission is
to ensure the coherent implementation of the three lines of
Somfy’ Sustainable Development strategy: Planet, Employees and
Society.

Somfy has a Sustainable Development Department which, since
2017, has been attached to the Strategic Marketing Department.
Its missions are to guide the implementation of the Group’s
environmental commitments. The organisation as a whole and the
teams within the Group also contribute to the continuous
improvement of the Sustainable Development policy.

The task of the Group Human Resources Department and the
Group Communications Department is to guide the
implementation of Somfy’s commitments relating to social and
societal matters. In this regard, the Group Communications
Director is a member of the Somfy Foundation Board of Directors,
the main driving force of the Group’s citizenship policy, and whose
main purpose is to support projects that fight poor housing.

CONTEXTUAL DATA

Information was collected for 2016 and 2017, which enabled data and their variations to be compared on a constant group structure basis
throughout the analysis. As such, it is possible that 2016 comparison data has been restated (in comparison with the 2016 published data)
to incorporate corrections and in some cases slight amendments to the protocol (data collection framework).
At 31 December 2017, total Group workforce was 7,248 people (excluding temporary workers), compared with 6,436 in 2016, an increase

of 12.6%, and was analysed as follows:

The scope of analysis of the social data for the preparation of the 2017 CSR report was stable. It related to 41 Group companies and a
workforce at 31 December 2017 of 5,170 people, representing 71.3% of the Group’s total workforce (76.8% of the Group in 2016).

These companies are spread across five continents, and 30 countries (South Africa, Germany, UK, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China,
South Korea, Egypt, Spain, United States, France, Greece, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Norway, Netherlands, Poland, Republic of
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia and Turkey).

WORKFORCE

Over the 2017 financial year, the workforce grew 4.6%, going from 4,943 to 5,170 employees. 71% of this workforce is accounted for by the

seven industrial sites within the CSR scope.

84% of changes in staff took place in France and Central and Eastern Europe, primarily at SOPEM in Poland and Somfy Activités SA in France.

The Group pays particular attention to avoiding any form of discrimination and to optimising the equal treatment of employees and
applicants as far as possible. It is important to highlight the diversity in both our activities and in the people who are developing and

supporting them. In terms of gender equality, in 2017 the ratio of men to women in the workforce was stable with a breakdown of 54%
men and 46% women.

It should be noted that across the Group, this workforce ratio remained similar to 2016, namely 59% men and 41% women.
This variation between the Group and the CSR scope can be explained by the presence in the CSR scope of three major production sites
with overwhelmingly female staff (SOPEM, SITEM and LianDa) with an overall proportion of 75% women.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

In employment terms in 2017, there were 864 recruitments,
higher than the number of departures (636), which included 26
redundancies and dismissals. It should be noted that our activity
experiences seasonal peaks in production and therefore makes use
of short-term recruitment at its industrial sites. Moreover, the rate
of voluntary turnover"), exclusively involving resignations and
retirement, was 6.3% (vs 4.4% in 2016).

Concerning the employment and integration of people with a
disability, the majority of the Group’s companies are subject to
local regulations with which they comply. Some take additional
action, often with the support of specialist agencies, to improve
the working conditions of any employees affected by specific
health problems; their continued employment remaining an
ongoing priority. Several measures, such as adapting workstations
or working hours, adapting premises, or support in terms of
recognition, restructuring or reclassification can be seen.

PAYROLL

Across the Group, employee expenses amounted to €364.7 million
at 31December 2017, compared with €333.8 million at
31 December 2016.

Within the CSR scope, these totalled €294.8 million at
31 December 2017, representing 81% of the Group. It may be
noted that employee expenses within the CSR scope for 2016,
published last year, accounted for almost 83% of the Group’s
(€276.6 million).

A RESPONSIBLE SOCIAL POLICY

The financial results are by no means the only factors ensuring the
future of the Group. The commitment, motivation and wellbeing
of employees are the key factors determining the Group’s
long-term competitiveness and performance. It is therefore
essential that the Group understands its teams to better support
and value them.
In line with the new strategic roadmap Believe & Act! and its
decidedly human driver Better Together, it has proved necessary
for the Group to maintain and turn into reality the HR initiatives
already launched in previous years by highlighting the three new
boosters that will guide the actions of each employee:
— #SomfySpirit to support empowerment and _ personal
development;
— #CSR to grow sustainably and responsibly with our community;
— #EmployeeJourney to support our teams at every stage in their
careers.

The Somfy Spirit booster

Within an environment where businesses must give meaning and
must manage complexity, the Group aims to make #SomfySpirit a
daily reality and ensure that its culture is reflected in everything it
does.

This relates to our way of life, our identity and our development
model, as well as to the way in which we embody our values
(Boldness, Respect, Openness and Proximity). It means creating
working conditions in which we are personally fulfilled. This
concerns the way in which we apply our management principles.
Today, at Somfy, by embodying the Somfy Spirit we are ensuring a
long-term future for our Group and enabling every person to

flourish personally in their career with Somfy and to develop all
their talent and potential within their career path.

A strong corporate culture is a major factor in employee
commitment; it is the image that is conveyed outside the
company, which attracts new talents and new skills, it is what
helps us to make the best decision, it is what makes the working
environment a source of energy and satisfaction. A shared culture
promotes collaboration and helps people to work better together.
For several years now, a commitment survey, Somfyscope, has
been conducted every two years with the Group employees” it
measures commitment rates across all teams. Following the
completion of the Somfyscope last edition, LianDa, for example,
initiated action plans that were introduced in 2017, such as the
refurbishment of working spaces and shared living spaces
(dormitory, staff canteen), the provision of a gym, the holding of
teambuilding events, and the development and skills training of
in-house trainers. All these initiatives will play a role in improving
employee commitment.

Somfyscope was last conducted in 2016. In the interim, and since
2017, Group management has committed to conducting a
quarterly survey, the Somfy Spirit Survey, to measure
improvements in the perceived effectiveness of scope-based
action on specific points: personal development, initiative-taking,
quality of delegation, quality of cooperation and customer focus.
This short periodic survey, available in 16 languages, helps to
measure how employees perceive the implementation of the
Somfy Spirit values and principles in their everyday lives. Just over
4,100 people are invited to take part in complete confidentiality,
whether they are connected or not. The latest edition of December
2017 was answered by 65% of the participants and received an
overall rating of 6.5 out of 10, which has remained stable
compared with the previous edition. Over both waves, the two
strengths identified were that taking the initiative was encouraged
and decisions were guided by customer satisfaction. This exercise
also helped to identify the area where improvement is expected:
cooperation between teams. The next survey will be conducted in
March 2018.

The Corporate Social Responsibility booster

The second booster in the people section: #CSR falls within the
context of the growing demand for CSR transparency and
performance from employees and more generally, from all the
company’s stakeholders.

The #CSR booster offers a pragmatic, step by step approach
involving a long-term commitment. It covers action plans that help
make Somfy more sustainable as a company and more active on
societal responsibility issues.

This booster specifically concerns therefore the sustainable
development policy, the environmental impact of our products and
their contribution to saving energy". The Group has now launched
firm and genuine initiatives on CSR in areas in which it feels
qualified. These measures have been extended around the world
thanks to local initiatives“, based on the belief that CSR not only
makes a major contribution to its vision and how to live better
together, but also improves the sustainability of the company.

A genuine #CSR policy contributes greatly to the sense of pride our
employees feel within the Group. It naturally integrates the
company in its societal environment (supporting local concerns).
CSR also forms part of what potential recruits are seeking in
companies for which they may work. This contributes to the

(1) Voluntary turnover calculation method: the ratio between the number of departures due to resignation and retirement over a given period AND the

number of employees at the end of the previous period (year).
(2) Survey accessible in electronic and paper format in 14 languages.

employer’s brand image and perfectly illustrates the Group’s
values “Respect” and “Openness”.

The Employee Journey booster

Lastly, the third and final booster #EmployeeJourney relies on the
undeniable fact that personal development at work is the key
factor in innovation and growth. It is the driving force behind
positive commitment.

This booster relates to the way in which we attract candidates and
the quality of the HR processes at every stage of life of Somfy
employees: the way in which the company supports each
employee, by looking after working conditions, the working
environment, recognition and motivation. It is about improving

skills and realising the full potential and development of
individuals.

Today, the Group’s primary concern is the long-term and
responsible promotion of personal development via

empowerment and growth.

By promoting good working conditions and personal development,
#EmployeeJourney helps to significantly improve motivation and
satisfaction at work, as well as cooperation and agility.

The company continued its effort to ensure that the skills of Group

employees are matched with the organisation’s needs, to ensure

the employability of staff and prepare tomorrow’s generation of

managers. To this end, investment in training focused on initiatives

likely to help the Group achieve its transformation objectives, in

order to act in a more agile, prompt and simple way both

collectively and individually, and to support cooperation and

performance.

The number of training hours") for the entire CSR scope was

approximately 72,020 hours”! in 2017 compared with 70,755 hours

in 2016", representing an increase of 1.8%. At Somfy Activités SA,

for example, 3.6% of the payroll was spent on training in 2017.

The main training areas used in 2017 primarily concerned the

development or improvement of:

— professional expertise (including Somfy products
technologies, quality, digital marketing, HR skills);

— in terms of Health and Safety — Somfy Activités SA has, for
example, been particularly focused on this topic;

— managerial skills;

— intercultural skills — practically one third of the number of
training hours for Somfy Activités SA;

— office tools skills;

— project management.

and

Work organisation is an important factor in this employee journey.
In all the companies within the scope, the average working week
complies with the applicable local legislation and varies between

(1) Published training hours refer to sessions lasting at least two hours.

35 and 45 hours of work per week. The most common working
week within the Group is 40 hours, covering more than 54% of the
staff within the scope of the study. Organisation by shift schedule
in 2017 related to the following production sites: Somfy Activités
SA, WAY SRL, SOPEM and primarily SITEM, in France, Italy, Poland
and Tunisia respectively. Overall, this organisation applied to
almost 28% of employees included in the scope. It should be noted
that almost 5% of all employees are part-time, mainly in Europe,
and to a far lesser extent in the United States, Australia, Russia,
Singapore, Israel and Japan.

Collective working hours can vary depending on production plans
and business opportunities. This flexibility is essential in adapting
to market needs. One of the adjustment parameters at industrial
level is night time working, which takes place on an ad hoc basis in
the event of a production peak.

Social relations are another factor inherent to employee life. Social
dialogue refers to all the relationships and interactions that exist
within the company between Management, executive staff, staff
representatives and employees. It is an important component in
regulating the collective organisation of work, and it enables the
Group’s social frame of reference to progress and employees to be
informed about the Group’s position and its areas of development
and transformation. The company wishes to enhance its quality
and role.

All the companies in the CSR review scope comply with the local
laws and agreements connected with their activities. Although not
all have union representatives, social dialogue is guaranteed or
implemented through regular meetings and/or communication
with staff representative bodies or with employees directly. When
there is no union representative, the managerial principles set out
in Somfy Spirit thus become the basis for initiating a dialogue with
employees in order to unite them around a shared project.
Generally, the companies in France, Italy, Germany, Tunisia and
Poland have union representation, as well as LianDa, in China, and
more recently Spain. The others, which are smaller in terms of
workforce and subject to fewer requirements in this field,
encourage social dialogue via direct meetings with employees.
Certain companies signed new agreements in 2017 or
amendments to agreements in place, primarily in the fields of
social dialogue (France), salaries and employee benefits (China,
France, Italy and Tunisia), structuring of the working week
(Germany), equal treatment (France), quality of working life (Italy),
training (Italy), and health and safety (Australia, Italy, China,
Greece).

Several countries including Poland, France, Norway and Sweden
have continued to take action to improve the “Quality of Working
Life”. In France, these initiatives notably take the form of time and
financial assistance devoted to sports activities, concierge services
and early childhood care through the Maison d’Assistantes
Maternelles.

The careful attention given to the health and safety of employees
also forms an integral part of the Employee Journey. Somfy’s
corporate responsibility begins with a guarantee to ensure
everyone’s physical safety and discover a quality of life within their
working environment that encourages commitment.

Most of the companies have an Occupational Health Department
and internal safety functions, supported by company doctors and
specialists in ergonomics, notably in France, Tunisia and Poland.
Efforts have been made in many countries to reduce the exposure
to risks and to improve working conditions.

Work accidents frequency and severity rate indicator

In 2017, many companies within the CSR scope strengthened their
communication and awareness raising initiatives in the field of
occupational risks. Specific examples involve tangible initiatives on
our industrial sites (pedestrian walkways, evacuation signage,
safety induction booklets, skylight renovation, etc.) and more
broadly awareness concerning mobile employees in relation to the
issue of travel risks.

The frequency" and severity” rates are reviewed according to the
industrial or commercial activity of the companies. For the record,
the industrial activity involves 3,667 people and the commercial
activity involves 1,503.

Somfy Activités SA and SITEM accounted for 73% of the accidents
within the industrial CSR scope. As a result, these entities are
continuing their efforts, which include Short Interval Management
(SIM) that generates daily reviews with production employees
during which problems detected are reported. They are resolved
immediately insofar as possible and, if need be, employees have
five further senior levels whom they can contact. In addition,
SITEM managed to reduce both its frequency rate, which fell from
7.55 to 6.10 (down 19%), and its severity rate, which went from
0.07 to 0.05 (down 33%).

Work related accidents and occupational diseases are always
investigated, and preventive action implemented, by dedicated
working groups or specially appointed employee representative
bodies, according to country (HSWCC in France for example).
During 2017, the number of occupational diseases reported was
4, and in 2016 it was 7. Most of the occupational diseases
reported related to Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSls). Preventive
measures have also been continued: gestures and postures
training, workstation ergonomics and production station rotation.
In 2017, absences due to common illnesses, occupational diseases,
and work and commuting related accidents led to an absenteeism
of 4.8%") (4.2% in 2016) — days’ absence being taken into

consideration according to the calendar days protocol, i.e.
including Saturday and Sunday.

In conclusion, the launch of the new strategic plan Believe & Act !
is modelled on one of the Group’s values — Boldness. It heralds a
2018 that is focused on the roll-out of these drivers, their adoption
and their implementation by all teams in their everyday lives and
working environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

The 2017 CSR scope covers, among others, seven of the eight
factories located around the world, representing 71% of the
Group’s industrial workforce.

NATURE OF ACTIVITIES, ASSOCIATED RISKS AND MEASURES
TAKEN

The activities of the sites are of tertiary, industrial and logistical
natures.

Industrial sites mainly perform product assembly operations from
plastic and metallic components and circuit boards sourced from
outside the sites. Assembly operations do not product gas
emissions, liquid releases or substance discharges, with the
exception of packing waste and possible manufacturing scrap
which are subject to selective sorting and recovery.

There are no machine operations generating waste material.

There is no specific noise pollution generated by the industrial sites
affecting local residents. Indeed, operations are situated inside
buildings and mainly consist of the assembly of small parts.

Given the type of activity, there are no risks related to food waste.
The different sites are subject to classification levels compliant
with local regulations in relation to pollution or nuisance risks that
these facilities are likely to create.

The French sites are subject to an authorisation scheme for storage
in covered warehouses and a registration scheme for compression
facilities and installation of accumulators for recharging fork-lift
trucks.

There are no facilities that correspond to the maximum level,
“Authorisation with encumbrances — (AS)3” commonly known as
“SEVESO”.

Conclusions on the nature of activities, associated risks and
measures

For these reasons, the risk of air, soil, water and noise pollution is
low or non-existent. This report does not therefore provide any
information on these subjects. In relation to these risks of pollution
or nuisance that Somfy’s sites are likely to create and the
preventive measures introduced, the amount of provisions and
guarantees for environmental risks is nil.

Given this low level of environmental risk on these sites, there are
no specific resources deployed. The measures introduced are
managed by the Facilities Departments of the sites.

(1) Method for calculating the frequency rate = (Number of work-related accidents/Hours worked paid) * 1,000,000.
(2) Method for calculating the severity rate = (Days absence due to work-related accidents/Hours work paid) * 1,000.
(3) Given the diversity of regulatory approaches and even the lack of legal reporting requirements in certain countries, information on occupational diseases

mainly concerns the French entities (1,938 people in total).
(4) 2016 data corrected for one of the entities concerned.

(5) Method for calculating absenteeism = (Number of days’ absence in calendar days)/(hours worked and paid/(legal number of working hours per week/5)).

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

In 2017, the ambition for the Planet initiative was set out within
the framework of the strategic corporate project Believe and Act !.
This ambition is expressed as follows:

Somfy solutions offer benefits in terms of the energy performance

of the buildings that are fitted with them. In addition, Somfy

products are eco-designed and include the Act for Green® label.

These products are developed, manufactured and distributed by

teams that implement environmentally friendly practices.

This Act for Green® label is attributed to products that meet

eco-design requirements. The origins of Act for Green® can be

traced back to the results of a carbon assessment carried out in

2012". This carbon assessment had established work on electricity

consumption and the use of raw materials as priorities.

This eco-design approach, launched in 2015, was continued in

2017 with the certification of the following products:

— SMOOVE Origin and Sensitiv range of control units;

— Sunis Wirefree II io sensor;

— range of motors for J4 exterior venetian blinds.

Act for Green® is based on a framework taken into account by

Research & Development teams. It incorporates requirements that

are broken down according to several subject areas:

— controlling greenhouse gas emissions through moderate
electricity use and the choice of appropriate raw materials;

— seeking to use recycled and recyclable raw materials in the
composition of products;

— materials selected for their low impact on health and the
environment;

— product durability;

— a statement of the environmental impacts in line with the PEP
ecopassport® programme in which Somfy participates. This
programme, developed by the electricity industry, defines a
standardised method for making environmental declarations in
accordance with international regulations (ISO14025 &
ISO 14040s). The information contained in this PEP ecopassport®
has been independently verified by Bureau Veritas CODDE.

A roadmap for the integration of projects in the Act for Green®

programme had been drafted in collaboration with development

teams for the next three years.

Requests, from both customer and regulatory, in relation to

understanding the substances used in our products have

continued. Somfy is monitoring the progress and implementation
of these regulations by taking part in the FIEEC’s”) “GT Substances”
working group.

Somfy has a Sustainable Development Department. This

Department integrates the resources and skills necessary for the

completion of projects that come under the heading “Planet”. The

Sustainable Development Department rolls out its policy by

working with the teams concerned in the Group’s various sites and

businesses.

In 2017, the Group continued to implement measures to reduce

the environmental impact of its activities. Communication

initiatives were undertaken primarily through seminars involving

Group employees. They covered the Act for Green® programme as

well as the environmental policy’s vision within the context of

Believe & Act !.

For example, BFT Italia SpA has an ISO 14001 certified structure. In

2017, BFT prioritised its actions to reduce the energy use of its

(1) Carbon assessment carried out in 2012 based on 2011 data.

(2) FIEEC: French Federation of Electric, Electronic and Communication Industries.

products on standby and to reduce the use of non-recyclable

packaging. Emphasis was also placed on managing hazardous

waste such as oil and electronic components. This was undertaken
through in-house meetings and general communications with staff.

The SOPEM factory in Poland has an environmental policy based

on the following areas:

— conserving natural resources;

— contributing to sustainable development;

— cooperating with partners for environmental protection;

— improving energy efficiency.

At the start of 2017, Somfy Activités SA, in France, focused on

measures to help reduce air pollution by seeking to influence the

means of transport used for commuting to and from work. The

Arve Valley, a region covered by an Atmospheric Protection Plan,

and in which most of Somfy’s French sites are located, was indeed

hit by an exceptional air pollution incident.

Specific examples include the creation of the organisation G.R.E.EN

(French Group for the Environmental Responsibility of Companies),

of which Somfy is a founding member — G.R.E.EN Haute-Savoie

Mont Blanc. It brings together companies and local government

authorities from the region to promote initiatives that encourage

the sustainable development of companies in the Arve Valley and
the Haute-Savoie department.

Within this context, the first project implemented was the

car-sharing application WAYZ Up") specifically aimed at home to

work travel.

Other examples on the theme of mobility include:

— introduction of a mileage allowance for cycling: 126 people have
recorded a total of 54,142 km;

— bicycle maintenance service offered to employees;

— introduction of charging stations for electric company vehicles
and cars;

— gradual introduction of hybrid vehicles and fuel
replacement for diesel in the company vehicle fleet;

— a “Mobility Challenge” day aimed at changing commuting
practices was held again in 2017 with 27% of employees present
taking part, and more than 7,351 km travelled that was not
driven solo;

— an internal site has been created, bringing together all the
relevant information on air pollution, related in-house
initiatives, the various sustainable forms of transport and
testimonials.

Other notable efforts have also been made at Somfy Activités SA to

reduce the environmental impact of its activities:

— the measures introduced under the partnership with FRAB AuRA
(formerly Corabio) made it possible to achieve the target of
serving 19% local and organic products in Somfy’s company
restaurant in Cluses (up 3% compared with 2016);

— reuse of IT hardware: 508 products handled in 2017 including
348 computers. The update and removal of computer data is
performed by a company promoting the employment of
disabled people. These computers and various accessories are
then reused, thereby breathing new life into them. In 2017, 97%
of the equipment was reusable, with the remaining 3% sent for
recycling;

— work has also been carried out on the buildings to help reduce
energy consumption. It mainly involved improving insulation,
upgrading lighting systems to automated LED systems and
replacing cooling equipment.

Following on from the energy audit carried out in 2015, Somfy
Activités SA consolidated the approaches that had already been
undertaken in previous years relating to the modernisation of
thermal comfort and insulation systems, and the replacement of
fluorescents lighting with LEDs to reduce lighting-related electricity
consumption. This work is being carried in successive stages as
workshops and offices are refurbished.

Similarly, SOPEM is rolling out the installation of LED bulbs in its
new site extensions and in existing warehouses.

Raw materials

Somfy has incorporated requirements aimed at minimising the

depletion of raw materials in its Act for Green® framework:

— use of packaging materials with a minimum of 50% recycled
fibres;

— use of recycled paper in product instructions;

— ensuring products can be repaired as much as possible;

— ensuring durability of remote controls with products resistant to
cumulative shocks.

Some projects were initiated in 2017, as they were with SITEM, to

reduce production waste and therefore the quantity of raw

materials.

In France, Somfy Activités SA signed in 2013 a contract with

RECYLUM, an organisation authorised to process professional

WEEE. This is the result of an industry approach in which Somfy

was a stakeholder.

LAND USE

There are no mining operations on any Somfy’s sites.

Our plants have regular HOSHIN or 5S workshops in order to
optimise the footprint of the sites. A team of specialists, integrated
into the Group’s Industrial Department, is dedicated to leading
these projects at the Group’s plants.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Our industrial activities do not present any risks linked to climate
change, whether they relate to the growing scarcity of water, rising
sea levels or the rise in temperature.

Solar protection systems motorised and automated by the
solutions offered by the Group help to reduce the energy
consumption of buildings. This is achieved both by reducing the
winter heat loss of buildings and by protecting them from the heat
in summer, thereby improving comfort in the summer and helping
to reduce the installed air conditioning capacity.

Somfy is a member of the Active House Alliance, which promotes
healthier, more comfortable buildings that do not have a negative
impact on the climate™.

Although Somfy solutions help lower the overall carbon impact of
buildings, Somfy is also committed to reducing the impact of its
activities. As such, the Group relies on the results of a carbon
assessment"! to identify the significant sources of greenhouse
gases emitted as a result of company operations, in particular due
to the use of the goods and services it manufactures.

This carbon assessment carried out across scopes 1, 2 and 3 and
within the scope of Somfy Activités SA helped to rank the different
causes of greenhouse gas emissions by order of importance. This
assessment was carried out with the support of the Eco2 Initiative.

(1) The 2017 values for gas and electricity at BFT Italia SpA have been restated to take into account dates of meter readings and to adjust usage over a

one-year period.

(2) Somfy does not report usage that does not fall within the operational activity of the sites (for example: testing fire safety systems).

(3) https://www.activehouse.info/about/about-active-house/.
(4) Carbon assessment carried out in 2012 based on 2011 data.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

Between them, the electricity consuming of products (use
consumption/usage) and raw materials (inputs) items accounted
for 85% of greenhouse gas emissions by Somfy Activités SA.

These two items relate to products manufactured and thus to the
activity of the industrial sites.

Given that the nature of the activity of the industrial sites and the
types of products manufactured are identical and have not
changed since 2011, this Somfy Activités SA carbon assessment is
representative of all the Group’s industrial sites. The emissions of
the different items are proportional to the activity of each
industrial site. The ranking by order of importance of greenhouse
gas emissions is therefore deemed to be the same between 2011
and 2017 and across all sites.

Quantities manufactured by Somfy Activités SA accounted for 25%
of all quantities manufactured by the Group in 2011.

This led to the establishment of the Act for Green® programme,
described in the “General Environmental Policy” chapter. As this
programme is being applied progressively to all products and
markets, it is leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
across all production sites.

However, other items, such as transport or energy consumption,
have not been neglected, with mobility programmes at Somfy
Activités SA and initiatives to reduce energy consumption at the
sites (see in particular the energy section in this report).

Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the use of raw materials
that form part of the composition of the products are also taken
into account:

— analyses of the lifecycles of products conducted on the control
points highlight that it is the microprocessor that generates the
largest portion of emissions, accounting for over 25%. By way of
example, the Act for Green® criteria recommend the use of QFN
type microprocessors which, in comparison with the QFP
versions prohibited by Act for Green® generate a five-fold
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions;

— research has also been conducted into the use of recycled
plastics. However, the plastic materials used in electrical and
electronic equipment (EEE) must meet very high specifications
and standards in relation to fire testing and dielectric properties
(notably CEI 335-1, UL 746 C). These materials are not currently
available on the recycled plastics market. Somfy is supporting
the work of the FIEEC" to make progress in this field.

In general terms, Somfy contributes to the implementation of the

circular economy through its involvement in professional

organisations such as the FIEEC, IGNES® and the Technical

Committee 111").

Somfy has decided to monitor a significant indicator concerning its

greenhouse gas emissions and regarding which it is able to take

action: the energy consumption of its products when on standby.

The amount of CO, emissions for motors sold in 2017 stood at

40.30 kg of CO, per motor.

The data used in the calculation was provided by the Group and

has a low level of uncertainty. However, the emission factor used is

based on average European data, ultimately resulting in a level of
uncertainty classed as medium.

PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY

The SOPEM factory in Poland is located on the edge of protected
sites belonging to the Natura 2000 network:

— Puszcza Niepolomicka PLB 120002;

— Torfowisko Wielkie PLH120080.

Somfy Activités SA owns several sites in the heart of the French
Alps, near Mont Blanc. Somfy wants to act to protect the
mountain’s eco-systems and is involved in local initiatives such as
the “Club d’Entreprises pour la Montagne et son Développement
Durable” (CEM2D) (Club of businesses supporting the mountain
and its sustainable development). A Charter was notably
developed in 2013.

SOCIETAL INFORMATION

TERRITORIAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT

Consideration of the local impact of the company’s activity
in relation to employment and regional development

Leader in its business sectors, Somfy grew, which in 2017 had a
positive impact on employment across all the regions in which it
Operates, as suggested by the 12.6% increase in the Group’s
workforce.

As with the previous two years, the significant expansion of the
Eastern Europe region resulted in the recruitment of staff at the
SOPEM factory; it was the only region to see its workforce grow by
almost 20% (within the CSR social scope). This development of
local employment was accompanied by a transfer of Group
knowledge and skills.

The Group prioritises the local recruitment of all employees, as this
offers advantages in terms of the understanding of local issues and
cultures which is essential in particular in the residential sector.
The recruitment of local executives in the factories also leads to
better and more culturally sensitive management both in terms of
social dialogue and performance improvement.

Moreover, the Group wants production sites to be autonomous in
their methods and their supply. The sites have autonomy in their
choice of suppliers from a panel jointly constructed and managed
by Group Purchasing. The aim is to maintain consistency in the
purchasing strategy whilst going as far as possible to ensure local
implementation in relation to sub-contracting and supply. This
openness is beneficial to the Group which in return benefits from
successful local initiatives which can then be rolled out elsewhere.

Consideration of the impact on neighbouring
and local populations

In order to promote regional development, the Group helps to
support higher education in the Auvergne Rhéne-Alpes region, in
part thanks to its role as a founding member of the Université
Savoie Mont Blanc (USMB) Foundation alongside the Assemblée
des Pays de Savoie (regional government) and the Université
Savoie Mont Blanc Club des Entreprises (Business Club). This
selection forms part of the longstanding relationship between the
University and Somfy, which has continued since the creation in
1991 of the Club des Entreprises. Somfy is working alongside the
University to bring the academic world closer to the business
world. As such, as part of this Business Club, the University has
links to help identify opportunities for its students who are seeking
professional training contracts.

Moreover, since 2012 the Group has chaired the Board of the Ecole
Polytech Annecy Chambéry, the University’s engineering school,
where Somfy contributed to lectures on innovation. In addition,
the school has received accreditation for a new IT course on Usage
Data, which Somfy has supported by showing its interest and
participating in the audit of the Commission des Titres (French
Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education).

Somfy is heavily involved in competitiveness centres and
technology clusters active in the Arve valley (Haute-Savoie), where
the Group’s historical sites are located. Somfy participates in
Thésame, the technological network for mechatronics businesses
and in the Public Interest Group MIND, an innovative Franco-Swiss
platform specialised in the field of mechatronics. Mechatronics is
the synergetic and systematic combination of mechanics,
electronics and real time computing, and is at the heart of Somfy’s
expertise. These collaborations enable the company to be
committed to local industrial development whilst continuing to
benefit from the input of skills and innovations into our design and
industrialisation processes.

RELATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Conditions for dialogue with stakeholders

The Group annually reviews its communication plan in relation to
its stakeholders, to ensure they are kept regularly informed and to
facilitate as much as possible constructive discussions in relation to
the Group’s strategy and management with the stakeholders
identified as priorities: employees, shareholders, investors,
customers, users, suppliers and regional governments.

The social section of this report summarises all the developments
and improvements made as part of the dialogue with employees
and social partners.

In 2017, the first edition of Investor Day took place in Paris in front
of an audience of economic journalists and financial analysts,
during which the Group’s strategy was presented by the Group
CEO and other members of the Executive Committee.

We distinguish between customers, a term that refers to the
professionals or distributors who buy and sell, integrate, or install
our products, and users, a term that refers to the end users of our
products, whether they are the customers of our customers, users
of our solutions in offices or communal facilities, or consumers
buying our products on our websites. Being responsive to
professional customers is a strategic priority for Somfy and it is
structured within a programme called “Customer First”. For each
customer profile, the Group has developed dialogue-based
activities — studies, surveys, training, services — tailored to the
expectations of these stakeholders. Our quality survey helped to
achieve a Net Promoter Score of 69 out of 100, which is an
excellent result. The survey also enabled us to identify areas
requiring improvement.

Users are regularly consulted as part of the development of our
new offers. A forum moderated by Somfy gives them a voice in
France. Other users can thus answer questions, and so can
company employees. More than 11,000 new questions were
therefore asked via this means in 2017 and the annual number of
visitors reached a million. This total number of 45,000 participants
since the launch of the forum in 2013 enables our hotline to be
more efficient and to answer calls more quickly and has led to
productivity gains in this telephone support service.

Involved in the development of the areas in which the Group is
located, Somfy has led dialogue in France with the various levels of

public decision-making to contribute to action in the areas of
education, employment, research and development, or to support
cultural and sporting projects for local people, by trying where
possible to replicate these events within the company for the
benefit of employees. These cultural and sporting programmes
include meetings at the Pays du Mont-Blanc (Pays du Mont-Blanc),
Plein Feux Festival (Bonneville), MB Race (Pays du Mont-Blanc),
and various sports clubs (Cluses). This collaboration can take the
form of patronage or sponsorship, since the visibility of Somfy’s
initiatives by Group employees or local residents is one of the aims
of this commitment.

Acts of support, partnership or sponsorship

Action to support top athletes

Somfy has been a partner of the French Ski Federation and the
French Biathlon Team since 2005, and all Nordic Skiing since 2014
(Biathlon, Cross Country, Ski Jumping, Nordic Combined). A
committed supporter of sporting initiatives for more than 20 years,
the Group also sponsors three talented biathletes individually:
Martin Fourcade, Marie Dorin-Habert and Simon Fourcade.

In 2014, Somfy created Somfy Ski Talents, a sponsorship
programme for promising top skiers: Clément Parisse, Thomas
Clarion, Enora Latuilligre and Jonas Devouassoux. In addition to
supporting athletes financially, Somfy offers to help them in
preparation for their transition into, or in finding out about, the
business world. Lastly, the Group helps athletes to build their
reputations by passing on their news via its social networks.

Acitizen’s policy involving employees

Somfy is committed to improving the living conditions of all, and
the company’s foundation was established in 2004 to support this
worthwhile cause. Since then, it has pursued its civic action to
combat poor housing and to help people live better together.

The Foundation is now a philanthropic organisation in its own
right, both in terms of financial and human contributions. Both
initiatives are implemented through the international programme
A House is A Home and the crowdfunding programme Les Petites
Pierres".

In 2017, Somfy gave the Foundation’s initiatives €376,000, and
provided an operational team of five people.

The same goals lie at the heart of both the A House is A Home and
Les Petites Pierres programmes: steadily forging the bonds of
humanity that form the basis of a balanced society, developing
lasting relationships, and working hand-in-hand with community
partners identified as stakeholders and project leaders. This helps
promote the values of solidarity within the company.

Les Petites Pierres

The endowment fund Les Petites Pierres is a digital crowdfunding
platform initiated by the Somfy Foundation. It enables anyone to
donate to community projects in the area of access to decent
housing, with every donation by an individual being matched (i.e.
doubled) by the Somfy Foundation and other partner companies.
In 2017, the platform enabled 49 projects to be funded (135
projects since it was founded in 2013), for a total, topped up by the
Foundation, of €220,000. Since November 2013, the platform has
been able to give €1,547,832 to organisations.

In addition to project funding, non-profit organisations receive
assistance with digital skills learning, thereby helping them to
leverage their various communities and other partners
independently.

A House is A Home

Because it is both important and socially responsible to make a
commitment in the countries where the company operates, the
Somfy Foundation is now working with eleven projects of
non-profit organisations fighting against inadequate housing in
nine different countries (Brazil, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Lebanon,
Poland, United States, Australia and France). Poor housing is a
problem that is present throughout the world. As an international
company, Somfy wishes to make its own contribution by ensuring
decent housing is available to as many people as possible.

Through its socially-responsible commitment, the Somfy
Foundation gives real substance to the values of responsibility,
openness and respect of the company. The A House is A Home"
programme, started in January 2015 and was consolidated in 2017
with the introduction of personal philanthropy in certain
subsidiaries in addition to the financial support provided.

Employee involvement

Personal philanthropy serves both the A House is A Home and Les
Petites Pierres programmes.

Introduced in France for Somfy Activités SA, in 2017 this personal
philanthropy saw the skills and energy of 283 employees donated
to non-profit organisations over the course of 49 days of solidarity.
They were 165 in 2016, an increase of 71%, demonstrating the
interest shown by employees in this programme.

In addition, making the Foundation’s actions international has
been made possible thanks to the very active involvement of
Somfy’s subsidiaries. The latter have made both financial and
human commitments: organising their HR and legal framework
enabling their employees to be involved in solidarity initiatives
during working hours.

SUB-CONTRACTING AND SUPPLIERS

Suppliers and sub-contracting are important for the Group due to
the nature of its industrial activity which is essentially assembly.
Indeed, all the components that form part of the composition of
the products are purchased components.
In order to make progress in relation to responsible purchasing,
Somfy, in collaboration with other manufacturers, has developed a
maturity frame of reference in relation to collective and
responsible purchasing: this framework incorporates the central
issues of the standard, ISO 26000.
This work was carried out within the framework of PEAK, a
business Research and Training network aimed at developing
collaborative customer supplier relationships.
The Group is working on the introduction of measures to
guarantee that its suppliers and sub-contractors are socially and
environmentally responsible. Thus, Somfy has auditors who assess
suppliers prior to their admittance to the panel. These audits are
conducted on the basis of a questionnaire that includes questions
on the following topics:
— existence of an environmental policy;
— organisation to ensure that products conform to environmental
requirements;
— existence of a health and safety policy and consideration of
ergonomic and safety aspects in the design of workstations.
These questions are rated, with the ratings forming part of the
final assessment score of the supplier. If significant variations are

discovered, relating for example to safety in the workplace, the
Group may ask the supplier to take corrective action.

For every component developed by a supplier, the Group requests
a written undertaking relating to the European Directives REACH
and ROHS.

In accordance with the regulations adopted by the US Securities
and Exchange Commission in 2012, the Group implemented its
duty of diligence in respect of its supply chain, in order to ensure
that the supplies used in its products do not contain any “Conflict
Minerals”.

In 2017, a special event bringing together 210 suppliers from
Europe, Africa, the United States and Asia was held in SOPEM’s
factory in Poland. The aim was to reinforce the Group’s appeal to
existing and potential suppliers through a detailed presentation of
our strategy and testimonials regarding recent projects. The
success of this event resulted from the collaboration between the
Activities, Supply Chain, Industrial, Purchasing and Corporate
Communications Departments.

FAIR PRACTICES
Eth ics Since 2015, Somfy has specifically rolled out an Ethics
== Charter and all employees have been made aware of
its contents and trained in ethical concepts by their managers.
“With its continued growth, the Group enjoys [...] great visibility in
many countries and in increasingly diverse markets. Our position
as leader in several of our industries and our ambition for
tomorrow involves increased responsibilities that we wish to
assume. In fact, the success of our business will only endure if we
clearly assert our requirements as an ethical and responsible
business.”" The Group therefore wants to maintain the
requirement for exemplary behaviour on a day-to-day basis. As
such, the Ethics Charter is intended to serve as a point of
reference in terms of individual and collective behaviour and will
guide our day-to-day activities enabling us to embody our values.
It is a common and unifying document; a tool for the promotion of
dialogue between employees so that ethics is an open matter
understood by all. Somfy and its employees particularly seek to
respect the regulations of the countries in which it operates in
relation to organisation of work, whilst subscribing to the
principles and objectives of the fundamental conventions of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) and by aiming to adopt the
practices of a responsible and respectful of everyone
management. A role of the network of HR Managers is to ensure
the respect of Human Rights, particularly examining within their
scope rights and concerns relating to racial discrimination, torture,
enforced disappearances, disabled people and the rights of
women, children, migrants, minorities and indigenous peoples.
This is reflected in a commitment to:
— respect differences, improve diversity and reject discrimination;
— reject any kind of harassment, notably moral and sexual;
— ensure the health, safety and decent working conditions for the
company’s employees and partners;
— seek to develop the skills and employability of staff and their
professional development;
— reject any kind of illegal child labour and the use of forced
labour;
— reject any kind of corruption, whether active or passive;
— guarantee constructive social dialogue.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

In addition to this Ethics Charter and following the enactment of
the law on transparency, the fight against corruption and the
modernisation of the economy"), Somfy has chosen to adopt the
Middlenext Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct. This Code of
Conduct is designed to guide business behaviour. The Group has
decided to supplement it with several appendices in order to
provide practical advice, examples and links to other relevant
information.

MEASURES PROMOTING CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

Ensuring the safety of the users of its products is a top priority for
Somfy. Alongside other leading companies in the electrical industry
and the building shutters sector, the Group is heavily involved in
standardisation in order to ensure that the good safety practices
implemented in relation to product development are maintained.
This action operates on an international (IEC standards), European
(CENELEC and CEN standards) or local (UL standard for the United
States for example) scale. To show the compliance of Somfy
products with safety standards, these are accredited by
independent bodies in its different territories (VDE, NF, SASO, UL).
Through its Quality Management System, the Group ensures its
products compliance with the standards and requirements in place
within its markets. For an effective and safe installation of its
products, the Group has developed a network of expert installers
throughout the areas in which the Group is located. These
specialists benefit from professional training to help ensure that
the products are installed under optimum safety conditions both
for the installer and users. Every product is accompanied by usage
and safety instructions.

Somfy publishes online manuals on its websites. They are available
on about forty of our sites intended for users of our solutions (also
on our sites for professionals) and are translated into several
languages depending on the product listing. In addition, numerous
YouTube channels around the world broadcast presentations on
products and their operating instructions, usage tips, and even
demonstrations on installation and programming.

The Quality Management System is the backbone of performance
for the Group: it must enable each employee to become a regular
advocate of customer satisfaction. In order to respond to Somfy’s
development, customer expectations and those of all stakeholders,
the Group’s Quality Management System has been revised. Based
on the Group’s core values and principles, it aims to implement an
ongoing drive of continuous improvement at the service of
performance and customer satisfaction. It is intended to be simple,
used and useful, and able to meet high standards as and when
necessary. Independent of any organisations, it clarifies
cross-company operations and promotes cooperation. This system
is a common base. It is incumbent upon teams to elaborate on it
and make it work in their own context.

METHODOLOGY NOTE

REPORTING PROTOCOL

The Groups’ CSR reporting protocol is the reference guide for all
those involved in CSR reporting within the Group. It is drawn up in
French and English. Its purpose is to define all the Group’s CSR
indicators along with their method of calculation, and to describe
the procedures for their collection and for reporting in order to
promote the consistency and comparability of data. This document
is distributed to and applied at all levels of data reporting. The
reporting protocol is updated annually to take into account Group
developments.

The CSR reporting protocol also serves as a reference framework
for the external verification of data, in accordance with Article
L.225-102-1 of the Commercial Code (“Grenelle 2” law). It is
available on request from Head Office.

SELECTION OF INDICATORS

The Group’s indicators were defined by the CSR officers for each
area in line with the Group’s CSR strategy and the resulting social,
environmental and societal objectives. They facilitate the
monitoring of the CSR policy’s progress in each of the
improvement areas identified by the Group and the transparent
communication of the Group’s CSR performance in this report.

The indicators used comply with the Grenelle 2 decree and are
based on the general principles of the GRI (Global Reporting
Initiative) guidelines.

COLLECTION, INTERNAL CONTROL AND CONSOLIDATION

The collection of CSR indicators is ensured by the CSR officers
within their respective fields of expertise. They rely on their
network of local experts who provide the data. The CSR officers are
also responsible for monitoring the consistency and plausibility of
the data prior to its consolidation in order to generate the Group
indicators included in the CSR section of the management report.

REPORTING PERIOD

The data collected covers the period from 1January to

31 December 2017.

Depending on the indicators, it can relate to:

— an annual consolidation of the data from 1January 2017 to
31 December 2017;

— the data measured at 31 December 2017.

Where historical information is available, data is reported on the

last two financial years.

REPORTING SCOPE

Pursuant to Article L.225-102-1 of the Commercial Code,
companies which are controlled by the Group and_ fully
consolidated within the financial reporting scope are included
within the reporting scope. The concept of control means the
power to govern the financial and operational policies of an
affiliated company so as to benefit from its operations. Control is
generally deemed to exist where the Group holds more than half
of the controlled company’s voting rights.


--- Page 22 ---

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

For reasons of organisation and access to information, not all
Group companies have yet been included. The Group wants to use
perimeters that are more relevant depending on the topics
covered. As such, certain companies are excluded from the social
scope due to the existence of very low workforces in certain
organisations (distribution subsidiaries spread out over vast
geographic areas such as South America), or the lack of Human
Resources information systems designed for collecting data easily.
The distribution subsidiaries are excluded from the environmental
scope due to their low environmental impact in comparison with
the industrial sites.

Over the short-term, the Group plans to integrate all significant
companies that it fully owns. Only one company, Dooya, 70%
owned and comprising an industrial site, is not integrated. At 31
December 2017, Dooya’s workforce was 1,523 people (excluding
temporary workers), training costs were €0.2 million and energy
costs were €0.7 million.

Newly acquired companies are integrated into the reporting scope
following a probationary period necessary for the introduction of
reporting. Companies which were sold during the financial year are
not included within the reporting scope.

Specifics of the scope for 2017 reporting

The social reporting scope taken into account for the 2017
financial year is identical to that used in 2016 and includes the

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

INFORMATION ON RISKS

(ARTICLE L. 225-100-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

FINANCIAL RISKS

The main financial risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign
exchange, interest rate, liquidity, investment and raw materials
risks.

According to IFRS, all derivative financial instruments are
measured at their fair value. Fair value is either the market value
for listed instruments, or a value provided by financial institutions
in accordance with traditional criteria (over-the-counter market).
The amounts covered exclusively relate to current or future
transactions within the framework of the Group’s normal business
activities.

As part of the transposition of the MIF Directive that came into
force on 1 November 2007, Somfy SA and its French subsidiaries
opted for the “individual clients” category.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related
to its operational activities (intragroup sales of manufactured
products distributed by commercial subsidiaries outside the Euro
zone, these sales being denominated in local currencies and
purchases denominated in local currencies).

At comparable terms and conditions, the Group gives priority to
natural hedges (foreign currency purchases related to sales in the
same currency). The derivative financial instruments put into place
are forward foreign exchange contracts for the main currencies.
The management of foreign exchange risk is covered in note 7.3 to
the consolidated financial statements.

INTEREST RATE RISK

The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Management of the
interest rate relative to Group debt is based on consolidated
position and market conditions. The primary objective of the rate
risk management policy is to control Group financing costs.

The management of the interest rate risk is covered in note 7.3 to
the consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY RISK

The Group must have permanent access to the necessary financial

resources to allow it to finance its day-to-day activities and its

investments. The Group’s liquidity risk primarily arises from the

obligation to repay its existing debt, the funding of its future

requirements and observance of its financial ratios.

The granting of credit facilities is subject to Somfy SA’s

commitments to its banking partners to comply with two types of

financial covenants based on:

— the Group’s financial structure (net financial debt/shareholder’s
equity); and

— its ability to repay (net financial debt/EBITDA).

The management of liquidity risk is covered in note 7.3 to the

consolidated financial statements.

Credit facilities and compliance with covenants are detailed in

note 7.2.2.6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Mg SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 I

38

INVESTMENT RISK

The Group’s exposure to investment risk is related to its cash
surplus deposited with banks.

The management of investment risk is covered in note 7.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

RAW MATERIAL RISKS

The Group is exposed to fluctuations in the price of the raw
materials used in the manufacture of its products.

Somfy SA protects against this risk by placing firm orders with its
suppliers (physical hedges for copper and zinc) and via hedging
agreements for materials on the financial markets (copper and zinc
paper hedges) on components that cannot be physically hedged.
The management of raw material risks is covered in note 7.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

SHARE RISKS

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury shares. Given the
share price, it was not necessary to record a provision for
writedown at 31 December 2017.

LEGAL RISKS

The Group’s operations are not subject to specific regulations. Its
business does not require a specific legal or regulatory
authorisation with the exception of the compulsory listing in the
Register of Companies and stock exchange regulations.

The Group is involved in a number of disputes in respect of its
business. These should not have any significant negative impact on
the Group’s financial position.

To the Group’s knowledge, there were no exceptional events or
litigation likely to have a significant negative impact on the Group’s
or its subsidiaries’ operations, assets or results, other than those
mentioned in the highlights of the financial year.

INSURANCE — RISK COVERAGE

The Group covers the main risks with the following insurance

policies:

— “Property damage”, covering buildings and their contents
(equipment, goods, IT equipment) up to the maximum amount
of damage likely to be incurred;

— “Resulting loss of profit”.

Risks insured by these two policies include fire, explosions,

lightning, smoke, emissions, steam, impacts from airborne objects,

electrical risks, storms, snow, hail, water damage, frost, machine
breakage, IT equipment theft, natural disasters and other
non-designated events;

— “General civil liability relating to monetary consequences of an
insured entity’s liability following physical injury, property
damage or moral prejudice caused to a third party during or in
relation to its operations”;

— “Corporate officers’ civil liability”;

— “Transported goods”.

In addition, credit insurance contracts, both in France and

internationally, mitigate the consequences of customer default.

Approximately 80% of sales are covered by such contracts.


--- Page 26 ---

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

COUNTRY RISK

The majority of operations occur in safe areas such as Europe and
the United States.

The regions most exposed to current economic, geopolitical and
monetary uncertainties are Asia (China), Latin America (Brazil,
Argentina) and the Middle East (Levant). In total, they represent
approximately 10% of Group sales.

Sales growth in the UK stood at 10.9% on a like-for-like basis over
the financial year just ended, in spite of the uncertain environment
related to the prospect of Brexit.

FINANCIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE
CHANGE AND THE LOW-CARBON STRATEGY

Due to the nature of the products marketed (notably motors for
blinds), the Group’s activity is partly connected to weather
conditions, in particular during the first half of the year, during
which sales of motors for blinds are concentrated.

Due to its industrial activity, the Group is exposed to a certain
number of risks that are related to climate conditions (storms,
earthquakes, flooding, etc.) and as such, more widely, to climate

change. The Groupe set up an assessment of these risks and has all
the necessary insurances to cover any financial consequences.
Combating climate change is taken into account from the design of
the products through the Act for Green® programme. The Group
focuses as well on optimising the use of raw materials as on
ensuring energy efficiency and recyclability in order to reduce its
products’ carbon footprint.

With regard to the assessment of climate-change related risks and
the steps taken by the Group to reduce them as part of its
environmental strategy, please refer to section “Social and
environmental reporting”, paragraph “Environmental information”
of this report.

CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK

Customer credit risk is linked to the receivables portfolio and the
sometimes challenging economic environment in certain parts of
the world. Nevertheless, customer profile, the Group’s
international geographic presence and the credit insurance cover
help to mitigate this risk.

The management of credit risk is covered in note 4.5 to the
consolidated financial statements.

DESCRIPTION OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS
PROCEDURES RELATIVE TO THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING
OF FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION

(ARTICLE L. 225-100-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

STRATEGIC, BUDGETARY AND REPORTING
PROCESSES
The preparation of the budget is part of an annual strategic
process involving all the Activities, Business Areas and Business
Units, as well as all the Divisions, which define their own key
objectives, in line with the strategic guidelines set by General
Management.
The overall budget is prepared as part of an iterative process
involving all Group players. It is the result of the consolidation of
local budgets.
After approval by the General Management of the Group, every
manager becomes responsible for meeting his/her own budget.
The measurement of the achievement of objectives set out in the
budgets is carried out through a system of matrix reporting on a
monthly and quarterly basis, which enables results to be produced
on several axes (Business Area, Business Unit and Activity). It
comprises the standard financial data: operating accounts and
balance sheet indicators, and non-financial performance
indicators.
Reporting is complemented by strategic reports and quarterly
updates of forecast sales and profit for the current year. These
measurements enable a follow-up of the achievement of
objectives and provide corrective actions on a matrix basis and at
all levels of responsibility (consolidation, Business Areas, Business
Units, Activities, Legal Companies, Departments and Services).
In addition, three three-year plans, in line with Group strategy and
revised annually, are overseen by Management. They include:
— a PSMP (Products and Solutions Master Plan) which relates to
the development of the range of products and solutions;
— an industrial and logistics master plan for production facilities;
— amaster plan for information systems.

39

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group has defined a unique and common framework for the
recording of accounting and financial information.

It resulted in the definition and implementation within all
subsidiaries of a Group chart of accounts, as well as the definition
and implementation of the main management procedures
(inventories, non-current assets, trade receivables, etc.), which are
formalised in the Group Procedure Manual relayed through and
updated on the Group’s intranet.

The proper application of the chart of accounts, procedures and
reporting reliability is monitored by visits to subsidiaries, planned
within the context of year-end and half-year closing. It is also
verified during the budget preparation and monthly reporting
processes.

The Group team responsible for the preparation and control of
financial statements comprises:

— the consolidation team;

— the central financial control team.

This team relies on financial controllers, based in each Business
Area, reporting to the Group in its ten geographical areas.

In addition, each of the Activities benefits from at least one
dedicated financial controller.

The Group endeavours to lead this network via international
meetings and on-going training of accountants and financial
controllers.

Particular care is taken with risk analysis, through a review of asset
provisions and provisions for liabilities and charges, as well as
off-balance sheet commitments.

At each year-end, inventories are verified either through a
complete physical stock-take or by a rolling physical stocktaking
procedure.

Trade receivables are the subject of credit risk analyses with
respect to the measurement of provisions. In addition, the
company hedges the majority of its risk by entering into customer
credit insurance contracts, both in France and abroad.

MB SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017


--- Page 27 ---

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

Intragroup purchases, sales and balance sheet items are confirmed
monthly.

Inventory amounts originating from the Group are determined in
all entities in order to eliminate internal profit margins on
inventories.

A pre-closing meeting is organised each half-year with the Legal
Department to identify all liabilities and possible or stated
litigation and to calculate, with reference to the progress of cases,
corresponding provisions for liabilities and charges.

The review of various contracts, deposits, sureties and guarantees
also serves to identify off-balance sheet commitments.

The consolidation packages, including: balance sheet, income
statement, cash flow tables and related data, are then sent to the
Consolidation Department according to a predefined planning
schedule.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTROL

The Consolidation Department, after verifying the completeness of
financial information, the proper application of closing procedures
and restatements, performing the intragroup account
reconciliations and verifying the net equity justification, performs
financial statement consolidation using dedicated software.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with IFRS. In addition, accounting options selected are presented
to and approved by the Audit Committee.

FINANCIAL COMMUNICATION

Following their approval by the Supervisory Board, the half-year
and full-year financial statements are presented to the financial
community under the auspices of the SFAF (French financial
analyst society) and published in a report posted on the financial
issuer’s website (www.somfyfinance.com) as well as via a primary
information provider (www.lesechos-comfi.fr).

The other regulated information referred to in Article 221-1 of the
AMF’s general regulations is also available on both these sites.
Relevant information relating to the company’s business activities
is presented to the Audit Committee.

IT SYSTEMS

The BaaN integrated management package is installed in most
distribution subsidiaries, excluding Asia, where ERP Accpac has
been rolled out in the majority of cases.

For the companies that have an ERP (BaaN or Accpac) installed,
standard parameters are included (comprising a chart of accounts,
analytical follow-up and procedures).

Completion of the budget, monthly reporting, margin analysis by
product family and legal consolidation are all carried out on the
same platform (Hyperion), which improves uniformity and
facilitates the analysis of information.

TREASURY COMMITTEE/GROUP CASH
MANAGEMENT

The Group Treasury Department reports to the Group Chief
Financial Officer.

The Group Treasury Department is responsible for carrying out
transactions in cash management, financing and managing risks of
a financial or banking nature, and providing technical support to
subsidiaries’ cross-company functions, in connection with the
Group’s operations.

It has a duty to warn the Group Chief Financial Officer, the
Treasury Committee or the Management Board of developments
in the relevant markets and the fair assessment of risks.

A Treasury Committee meeting is held each month, chaired by the
Group’s Treasurer, to review:

Mg SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 I

40

— deposits;

— funding;

— the Group’s net debt;

— off-balance sheet banking commitments;

— foreign exchange positions;

— a macroeconomic review of the market;

— the Group’s cash and debt positions (current and forecast);

— miscellaneous items: ongoing acquisitions, follow up of late
payments, guaranties/securities, Group loans;

— miscellaneous projects (cash pooling, optimisation of cash
management systems...);

— the Group’s net financial income/(expense) (twice annually).

This Committee comprises the following members:

— the Group CFO;

— the Group Treasurer;

— members of the Group Treasury Department.

Members of the Management Board are ex-officio members and

have a standing invitation to Committee meetings.

The role of the Treasury Committee is twofold:

— strategic: to define the overall policy in terms of Group Cash
Management, financing, and interest rate, exchange rate and
investment risk management. They also include the follow-up of
Group subsidiaries’ equity balance sheet items;

— operational: to guarantee the regular monitoring of Group Cash
Management's actions. These are detailed in a monthly trend
chart.

The rules and procedures relating to the Group’s Cash

Management have been formalised in the Cash Management

Charter, which covers the following:

— ethics;

— liquidity/exchange rate/interest rate risk;

— deposit of excess cash;

— counterparty risk;

— governance.

This Charter was subject to a quality review in the second half of

2017.

Furthermore, a Group Treasury Charter has been in place since

1 November 2013 to define best practices and list in a single

document the guidelines that ensure the secure, economical and

AUTHORISATION TO BE GRANTED TO THE
MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR THE BUYBACK BY THE
COMPANY OF ITS OWN SHARES PURSUANT TO
ARTICLE L. 225-209 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE,
DURATION OF THE AUTHORISATION, OBJECTIVES,
TERMS AND CONDITIONS, CAP (resolution 11)

A share buyback plan for a period of 18 months will be submitted
for your approval. This plan would replace the current programme,
which would be terminated early. It would allow management to
purchase up to 10% of the shares of the company, if necessary
restated for any potential capital increase or decrease transactions
that may be carried out over the timeframe of the programme.
The objectives of this programme would be:

4B

— to stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the
Somfy share, by way of an investment services provider within a
liquidity contract that complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI
recognised by regulations, it being specified that within this
framework the number of shares considered for the calculation
of the limit specified above corresponds to the number of shares
purchased less the number of shares resold;

— to retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange them
or use them as payment within the framework of potential
acquisitions;

— to ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or
corporate officers of the Group, as well as all other shares
allocated under a company or group savings scheme (or similar),
in relation to employee profit sharing and/or any other form of
allocation to employees and/or corporate officers of the Group;

— to cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of
company shares, in accordance with applicable regulations;

— to proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired, in
accordance with the authorisation granted or to be granted by
the Extraordinary General Meeting.

Such share purchases may be effected by all means, including by

means of acquiring blocks of shares and at any times considered

appropriate by the Management Board.

The company would reserve the right to use options or derivative

instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

We propose to set the maximum purchase price at €130 per share.

The maximum value of the transaction, taking account of the

2,658,967 treasury shares held at 31 December 2017, is therefore

set at €135,334,290.00.

AUTHORISATION TO BE GRANTED TO THE
MANAGEMENT BOARD TO CANCEL SHARES BOUGHT
BACK BY THE COMPANY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK
SET OUT BY ARTICLE L. 225-209 OF THE
COMMERCIAL CODE, DURATION OF THE
AUTHORISATION, CAP (resolution 12)

Under the cancellation objective, we would ask you to grant
authority to the Management Board, for a period of 24 months, at
its own discretion, on one or more occasions, within a limit of 10%
of capital, calculated on the day on which the cancellation decision
is made, reduced by the number of shares cancelled during the
previous 24 months, to cancel the shares which the company holds
or could hold following share buybacks exercised within the
framework of its share buyback programme as well as to reduce
share capital by the corresponding amount pursuant to the legal
and regulatory provisions in force.

AUTHORISATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRANTING
STOCK OPTIONS TO SALARIED EMPLOYEES AND/OR
CERTAIN CORPORATE OFFICERS (resolution 13)

We propose that you authorise, for a period of 38 months, the
Management Board to grant stock options to employees, to some
of them or to certain categories of employees, and/or corporate
officers as defined by law, of the company or related companies or
affiliated economic interest groups under the conditions of Article
L. 225-180 of the Commercial Code.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

The total number of options that may be granted by the
Management Board under this authorisation may not entitle
beneficiaries to purchase more than 1.5% of the share capital
outstanding on the date of this Meeting, it being specified that this
limit will count towards the total number of shares that may be
granted free of charge by the Management Board under the
authorisation granted to the Management Board by the General
Meeting of 24May 2016 in its twelfth resolution, sitting in
extraordinary session and any other subsequent authorisation of
the same nature granted by the General Meeting.

The purchase price of the shares by the beneficiaries would be set
on the date options are granted by the Management Board,
pursuant to regulations, and may not be lower than the average
closing price of the last 20 trading days of the share on Euronext
Paris preceding the date options are allocated.

The term of the options set by the Management Board may not
exceed a period of six years from their date of allocation.

As such, the Management Board would have, within the limits set
above, all necessary powers to determine the other conditions and
arrangements for the allocation of the options and their exercise
and notably to set the conditions under which the options will be
granted and to approve the list or categories of beneficiaries as
provided for above, to set the period(s) during which the options
thereby granted may be exercised, provide for the capacity to
temporarily suspend the exercise of options for a maximum of
three months in the event of financial transactions involving the
exercise of a right attached to the shares, and generally do
anything that may be required in this regard.

ARTICLE L. 3332-21 OF THE LABOUR CODE
(resolution 14)

Also submitted to you will be an authorisation to increase the
share capital for the benefit of members of a company savings
plan, in order to comply with the provisions of the second
paragraph of Article L. 225-129-6 of the Commercial Code, under
whose terms the Extraordinary General Meeting must vote, at
least every three years, on a resolution to increase the share
capital under the conditions provided for by Articles L. 3332-18
and subsequent of the Labour Code.

Within this context, the Management Board will ask shareholders
to approve the delegation of authority to grant to the
Management Board, if it deems it appropriate and at its sole
discretion, to increase the share capital on one or more occasions
through the issue of ordinary shares and/or marketable securities
granting access to equity securities to be issued by the company
for members of one or several company or group savings plans of
the company and/or of the French or international entities related
to it in accordance with Article L. 225-180 of the Commercial Code
and Article L. 3344-1 of the Labour Code.

Ml SOMFY - ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 I 44

We propose to set the term of this authority to 26 months, starting
from the date of this General Meeting.

We propose to limit the maximum nominal amount of the increase
or increases that can be carried out through the use of this
authorisation to €500,000.00, this amount being independent of
any other cap set by other delegations to increase capital. The
nominal amount of the capital increase necessary to preserve the
rights of holders of rights or marketable securities giving access to
the company’s share capital — in accordance with the law and,
where applicable, the contractual stipulations providing for other
cases of adjustment — would be added to this amount where
applicable.

It is specified that, in accordance with the provisions of Article
L. 3332-19 of the Labour Code, the price of the shares to be issued
may not be more than 20% (or 30% when the lock-up period
provided for by the plan under Articles L. 3332-25 and L. 3332-26
of the Labour Code is greater than or equal to ten years) less than
the average of the share’s opening prices quoted during the 20
stock exchange sessions preceding the Management Board’s
decision relating to the share capital increase and the issue of the
corresponding shares, nor higher than this average.

In application of the provisions of Article L. 3332-21 of the Labour
Code, the Management Board may provide for the allocation, to
the beneficiaries, of free shares to be issued or already issued, or
other shares granting access to the share capital of the company to
be issued or already issued, in respect of (i) the employer's
contribution that may be paid pursuant to the regulations relating
to company or group savings plans, and/or (ii), where applicable,
the discount.

The Management Board would have, within the limits set above,
the necessary powers notably to set the conditions of the issue(s),
record the completion of the resulting capital increases, amend the
bylaws accordingly, charge, at its sole discretion, the costs of the
capital increases against the related premiums and deduct from
such amount the sums necessary to take the statutory reserve to
one tenth of the new share capital after each increase, and more
generally, do whatever is necessary in such matters.

This delegation would, where applicable, cause any unused portion
of any prior delegation to lapse.

The Management Board may or may not implement. this
delegation and take all the necessary steps and fulfil all the
necessary formalities.

Nevertheless, inasmuch as this authorisation appears neither
relevant nor timely to it, the Management Board suggests that you
reject it.

ALIGNMENT OF ARTICLE 20 OF THE BYLAWS
(resolution 15)

You will be asked to bring Article 20 of the bylaws into line with the
provisions of Article R. 225-60 as amended by Decree n°2017-340
of 16 March 2017 which stipulates that the Supervisory Board shall
freely distribute among its members, under the conditions
provided for by Article L. 225-82-2, the overall amount allocated to
such persons in the form of attendance fees.

Your Management Board asks you to approve the above
resolutions submitted to your vote, with the exception of
resolution 14 which the Management Board suggest you vote
against.
