Group principles

Business model

The adesso Group is a fast-growing IT company
which has set its sights on becoming one of the
leading consulting and technology groups for
industry-specific business processes in Central
Europe. To do this, the establishment of additional
subsidiaries in Europe is being accelerated. With a
high level of expertise in the areas it caters to, adesso
operates at the interface between business processes
and IT, implementing software projects at the highest
technical level. Market penetration is increased
by the development of software solutions created
specifically for selected industries such as insurance,
banking and healthcare. The company’s development
is supplemented by an acquisition strategy designed
to increase the technology portfolio, the product
family and international expansion.

Adesso SE is listed among the largest companies in
IT consulting and system integration in Germany
and generates most of its sales revenue through
consulting and software development in Germany.
Sales abroad are generated mainly by adesso’s foreign
subsidiaries in Switzerland, Austria and Turkey.

adesso has two different segments: IT Services and
IT Solutions. While the IT Services segment offers
customised, project-oriented services in the areas
of consulting and software development, the IT
Solutions businesses market their own solutions
as home-grown products or standard software
products.

The IT Services and IT Solutions divisions work
hand in hand on market penetration. Customers
mainly include international corporate groups, major
companies and important public administration
bodies, for which adesso SE is one of the strategic IT
partners.

Large-volume projects are also acquired in the face of
competition from companies with an international
focus. In each of the industries addressed by adesso,
the objective is to acquire more than SO % of the top
25 companies as customers.

Group structure

In addition to adesso SE, the largest operating
unit and parent company, the adesso Group also
includes 32 subsidiaries, 6 associated companies
and 2 joint ventures as at the reporting date. The
parent company adesso SE is publicly traded and
listed on nearly all German stock exchanges (ISIN
code: DEO00A0Z23Q5, WKN [national security
identification number]: AOZ23Q).

adesso SE’s largest location is Dortmund, which
is also the city in which the company was founded
and where its corporate headquarters are located. To
stay close to its customers and keep travel times and
costs as low as possible, adesso maintains 25 other
offices in all of Germany’s major economic regions.
This broad local presence is also extremely important
in terms of recruitment. The biggest international
locations are Amsterdam, Barcelona, Basel, Bern,
Boston, Budapest, Istanbul, Jerez de la Frontera,
Lausanne, Lugano, Madrid, Sofia, Vienna and Zurich.

A European Employee Forum (EEF) was established
at adesso when it converted to become an SE
(Societas Europaea) in November 2019. The
European Employee Forum consists of employees
from the adesso Group and is elected by the
employees themselves. The EEF meets regularly with
the Executive Board and exchanges information on
employee-related issues in the adesso Group.

At the end of 2020, adesso had a workforce of
4,975 full-time equivalents (FTE) across the Group
(previous year: 4,033) in Germany, other European
countries, Turkey and the USA. Of these, 972
(previous year: 705) FTE worked for the adesso
Group abroad, whereas 3,094 (previous year: 2,222)
FTE worked for the parent company adesso SE in
Germany.

Targets and strategies

adesso’s aim is the rapid expansion of the company
into one of the leading consulting firms for industry-
specific business processes in Europe. A further aim
is the development of industry-specific products
and solutions based on its employees’ high level of
expertise in the core industries addressed by adesso
and good market penetration.

In conjunction with the focused business model and
the high margins aimed for, the growth achieved so
far and planned for the future aimed are expected
to result in a sustainable increase in the value of the
company.

adesso puts significant resources into strategic
business development, the expansion of sales
capacities, recruiting and marketing, including series
of sales-related events. These investments, coupled
with extensive industry and consulting expertise,
generate growth figures which are well above the
industry average.

adesso is a leading corporate group in the field of
software development and invests more than average
in the training and development of our workforce
and in ongoing development of the adesso model for
the software development process.

The Executive Board is committed to a strategy
of striving for the right balance of growth, solid
finances and profitability. It must always be possible
to operate from a position of financial strength and
at the same time, through the payment of a divi-
dend, achieve an ongoing return on the capital
invested by the shareholders. It is a stated aim of
the company that the dividend should be increased
ona regular basis.

Management system

As the holding company of the adesso Group,
adesso SE defines the strategy and operational
targets of all Group companies. It controls the legally
independent Group companies by implementing a
target system, carrying out an ongoing reporting
process and occupying positions in the supervisory
bodies and management teams.

Operational control is ensured by a reporting system
which has been implemented uniformly across
the Group. In the process, each Group company
prepares full monthly financial statements based on
national legal regulations. Key performance figures
for reporting are sales, EBITDA, earnings before tax
(EBT), the EBT margin, number and proportion of
employees not fully utilised, number of employees
and net liquidity. The most important performance
indicators are subject to continuous comparisons
with forecast and actual data. All indicators are
carried forward and subject to an internal Group
benchmark. Updated forecasts are prepared for each
Group company on a rolling basis for the entire year
to identify possible planning deviations in a timely
manner. Fixed reporting channels and cycles have
been defined, and there is also a fixed appointment
schedule for management meetings. There are no
fundamental differences between key performance
indicators in the reporting systems for each segment.

Research and development

The bulk of the adesso Group’s sales is attributable
to IT services. Research costs in the IT Solutions
segmentare negligible in relation to Group expenses.
None of the Group companies has its own dedicated
research department.

Economic report

Macroeconomic economic
conditions

The COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the global
economy into recession, with the German economy
also falling into negative territory after ten years
of growth. According to initial calculations by the
Federal Statistical Office, the gross domestic prod-
uct fell significantly by -5.0% in the fiscal year after
recording a slight increase of 0.6 % in the previous
year. Expectations initially fell dramatically in the
course of 2020 after the pandemic outbreak became
known, yet brightened somewhat later in the year.
In the annual projection of the end of January 2020,
an acceleration in GDP growth to 1.1% was initially

anticipated. At the end of April, however, a drop of
-6.3 % was forecast. This was gradually put into per-
spective, being revised to -5.8 % in September and to
-5.5 % at the end of October.

During the year, the coronavirus crisis caused an ini-
tial decline of -1.9 % in the first quarter followed by a
particularly severe impact in the second quarter, as a
result of the first lockdown, witha minus of 9.8%. As
aresult of the further (partial) lockdown in November
and its subsequent intensification and extension, and
after a remarkable recovery in the third quarter when
itreached 8.5%, economic performance stagnated in
the final quarter of 2020, increasing only slightly by
0.3 %. Nevertheless, the federal government sees the
German economy picking up again in 2021 as the
coronavirus situation eases, anticipating that GDP
will rise by 3.0% compared with the previous year.
However, the ministry does not expect economic
performance to return to pre-crisis levels until mid-
2022. Economic development will continue to be
significantly affected by the progress of the pandemic
and the measures introduced to contain it.

The downturn in 2020 of -5.0%, which was mod-
erate and only temporary by contrast to some expert
estimates, was due not only to the resilience of the

German economy butalso to the very extensive pack-
ages of measures by the federal government to sup-
port the economy and stabilize incomes. The 2021
annual economic report states that almost EUR 80
billion has been in delivered in fiscal measures since
the beginning of the crisis. In addition, an economic
package worth some EUR 50 billion is being targeted
at industries of the future, such as artificial intelli-
gence. Industrial production continued to increase
in November 2020 despite the partial lockdown, as
did incoming orders from the manufacturing sector.
According to the report, this indicates that industry
had adjusted better to the measures, unlike in the
spring of 2020. In contrast, the service sector is again
more heavily affected by the restrictions on social
contact. The employment market has shown stable
development, with employment showing a slight
upward trend since summer 2020. Unemployment
and underemployment decreased as the numbers on
short-time work flattened out, but these are expected
to rise again in the new lockdown.

For Switzerland, the federal government’s expert
group expects GDP growth of -3.3 % for 2020 in
its latest forecast. This also represents a massive
downturn compared with the previous year’s
growth of 1.1% or the original forecast given at

the end of 2019 of 1.7% for the whole of 2020.
As in Germany, economic forecasts were revised
several times during the course of the year due to
the coronavirus situation, including some fore-
casts in addition to the original schedule. Before
the easing of restrictions in Switzerland signalled
a gradual recovery, a fall in GDP, which had already
been adjusted for sports events, of a very significant
-6.7 % had been anticipated at the end of April.

In Austria, the leading economic research institutes
anticipate an even more significant fall in GDP of
between -7.3 % and -7.5 % for 2020, after growth of
1.4% was achieved the previous year, with a slightly
decreasing growth rate of 1.2% to 1.3 % for 2020 asa
whole already expected before the crisis.

In Turkey, the OECD expects only a slight decline
of -0.2 % in GDP in the reporting year, following
moderate growth in 2019 of 0.9%. At the end of
2019, growth of 3.0 % had originally been expected.
The effects of the pandemic on the economy devel-
oped later than in other countries in the region, but
were still clear.

In the USA, the OECD is expecting a 3.7 % decline in
GDP in 2020, after 2.2% growth in 2019.

In view of the severe effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economic areas in which adesso
mainly operates, the macroeconomic conditions in
2020 were considered to be significantly weaker
than expected for business development. The
original outlook for the year initially deteriorated
drastically in all economies relevant to adesso and
particularly in Germany, and followed a volatile
path alongside the measures taken to contain the
pandemic. Nevertheless, thanks to an interim
recovery phase in the summer, the recession was
less severe than forecasts after the first half of the
year suggested and a rapid recovery after the crisis
is now anticipated.

Industry-specific conditions

The industry association Bitkom expects that the
German market for information technology product
and service providers shrank by -0.7 % to EUR 94.6
billion in 2020. Compared to the previous year’s
growth of 4.0%, this represents a decline in the
IT market after a prolonged period of growth. The
main reason for this was the downturn of -3.2%
in IT Services (previous year: +2.4%) and -1.0%
in the Software segment (previous year: 7.3 %).

Annual Report 2020

By contrast, IT hardware recorded the same 3.2%
growth as the previous year. Relative to macroeco-
nomic development, the downturn in area of infor-
mation technology was comparatively moderate.
According to Bitkom estimates, the software
segment achieved a market volume of EUR 25.9
billion in 2020, and the IT services segment, the
most important area for the adesso Group in terms
of sales, reached EUR 39.6 billion.

Industry-specific conditions were therefore also a
negative factor in adesso’s business performance.

Business performance

Business performance in 2020 was affected by
unpredictability resulting from the coronavirus
pandemic. Although the first quarter got off to a
very good start due to good capacity utilisation,
the second quarter was heavily influenced by the
uncertainties triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
adesso customers terminated projects or postponed
orders, causing adesso to introduce arrangements for
short-time working for the first time in the compa-
ny’s history. In Germany the instrument of short-

time working was used in a targeted manner in some
organisational units in the period from April to July.
Between 70 and 236 employees were affected ina
range from 15% to 100 % of their respective work-
ing hours. The use of short-time working resulted in
corresponding reimbursement amounts of EUR 1.1
million. To secure liquidity, additional bank credit
lines were agreed with the house banks and tax
deferrals with the tax office. In the third quarter, the
market had come to terms with the crisis situation
and many companies were adjusting to the current
situation. adesso allowed most of its employees to
work from home and was able to continue to pro-
vide services thanks to modern IT infrastructure
and collaboration tools. The change in the conduct
of business was particularly difficult for sales, which
relies more on personal interaction than almost any
other area. Apart from that, however, adesso saved a
large amount of other operating expenses from April
2020 in comparison with previous years (especially
travel expenses, cancellation of trade shows, events
and corporate occasions). Then there is the stroke of
good fortune for adesso that its customers come from.
industries such as insurance, banking, healthcare and
the public sector. These industries have not been hit
so hard by the pandemic as compared to tourism,

aviation or hospitality, for example. These aspects
meant that adesso’s business model proved to be
relatively resilient to this type of crisis, and thanks to
the first license sales of the in|sure Ecosphere prod-
uct family, the third quarter was the most successful
quarter ever for the insurance industry. In the fourth
quarter, it was possible to sustain the positive aspects
of the business performance thus far, so that the year
as a whole could be concluded with record sales and
record earnings.

Overall statement on business performance by

the management

Business performance in 2020 can be considered very
positive overall. The adesso Group increased sales by
16% to EUR 523.4 million and EBITDA by 26% to
EUR 60.4 million. The guidance was therefore met
in full. Consolidated earnings and earnings per share
both increased by 20 % compared to the previous year.

The positive resilience effects associated with the
coronavirus pandemic, such as additional digitali-
sation initiatives, savings effects and a crisis-proof
customer base, outweighed negative aspects such
as intermittent weaknesses in capacity utilisation
and the cancellation or postponement of projects.

Position

Profitability

Growth in sales

The adesso Group successfully increased its sales by
16% to EUR 523.4 million in the 2020 financial year.
The purely organic growth (without consideration
of the company’s acquisitions in 2019 and 2020)
amounted to 15%.

With weighted negative market growth, relevant to
adesso, of -2.8 % for the industry, adesso, as it did
in previous years, had significantly higher organic
growth than the market in 2020.

In the second half of financial year 2020, revenue of
EUR 277.3 million was significantly higher than the
figure of EUR 246.1 million for the first half of the
year. This developmentis in line with the situation in
previous years, as the second half of the year generally
has a higher number of working days and often higher
licensing revenues.

The IT Services segment was able to further expand
sales (+23 %). In the IT Solutions segment, the highest
licence revenues for the insurance industry since the

This level could not be matched in full in 2020, and
overall the IT Solutions segment saw sales decline by
-14% compared with the previous year.

In the IT Services segment, the most significant
adesso subsidiary in the Group in terms of size,
adesso SE, was able to significantly expand its sales
in Germany, as in the previous year, and achieved
growth of 18%. The foreign subsidiaries in Turkey,
Austria, Switzerland and Spain posted double-digit

the core products in|sure and FirstSpirit; on the other,
less license income was generated than in 2019.
This was in part planned, butalso partly the result of
customers’ cautious approach to buying due to the
uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Both effects contributed to the fact that the IT Solu-
tions segment was not successful in 2020.

Banks/financial services providers and insurance com-
panies account for the largest proportion of adesso’s
sales. Due to difficult market conditions, a growth rate
of only 2% was achieved in both key industries. The
biggest sales growth was recorded in the public sector
and in the manufacturing sector, with both at around
34%. The sales with customers in Germany rose by
17 %in 2020, and by 30% outside Germany.

Earnings

In 2020, EBITDA increased by 26% to EUR 60.4
million, exceeding the originally forecast value of
EUR >S50 million and lying in the middle of the range
of EUR 55 to 65 million adjusted during the course
of 2020. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the
associated restrictions on social contacts in the public
domain to protect health and life, the adesso Group
was able to maintain its ability to deliver. The Group
was able to absorb slight declines in capacity utilisa-
tion through measures including temporary short-
time work and cost savings (especially with regard to
travel expenses).

At sales growth of 16%, the average number of
employees (FTEs) grew somewhat faster by 18% or
660, to 4,392 employees in 2020.

The material expenditure in the amount of
EUR 62.6 million, mainly caused by third-party
services (i.e. the incorporation of subcontractors
into projects), rose by 24% and was thus dispro-
portionate in comparison to the sales revenues.
Gross profit thus increased by 15% to EUR 460.8
million. Due to the use of external labour, the mate-
rial usage ratio of 12.0 % remained slightly above the
previous year’s figure of 11.2 %. Given the slightly
disproportionate growth in employees, the result is
a downward gross profit per employee of EUR 105
thousand (previous year: EUR 107 thousand). The
inclusion of external specialists follows the demand
at peak times and the incorporation of experts in
some projects. From a strategic perspective, the aim
is to have a high proportion of sales revenues from
in-house employees.

Personnel costs increased by 19% to EUR 350.1
million, while the average number of employees rose
by 18%. The average personnel costs per employee
remained stable at EUR 80 thousand, partly the result
of the increase in employee numbers in Turkey, Bul-
garia and Spain where personnel costs are lower.

Other operating expenses fell year on year by 12%
to EUR 57.8 million. The decrease is mainly due
to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated
restrictions on social contact in public spaces to

protect health and life. Travel expenses fell by
60% to EUR 6.5 million from EUR 16.5 million
the previous year. Other more substantial expense
items, such as the recruitment of personnel and the
cost of premises, however, increased year on year
by 17% and 18% respectively. Other operating
expenses per employee fell by 25 % year on year.

Total operating earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased
by 26%, or EUR 12.3 million in absolute terms,
to EUR 60.4 million in 2020. The EBITDA margin
came to 11.5%, up from 10.7 % in the previous
year. Alongside the increase in sales revenues
and the disproportionate increase in material and
personnel expenses relative to sales, the increase
in EBITDA is due to the sharp decline in other
operating expenses.

When viewed over the course of the year, the third
quarter made the largest contribution to earnings at
EUR 25.5 million. This was due in particular to better
capacity utilisation, low costs as a consequence of the
pandemic and the sale of in|sure licences.

The parent company adesso SE made the largest con-
tribution to earnings in the IT Services segment in
2020. The national companies in Switzerland, Aus-
tria and Turkey also made positive contributions to
earnings. In Germany, adesso as a service GmbH in
particular made a significantly higher contribution to
earnings than planned.

Inthe IT Solutions segment, only adesso mobile solu-
tions GmbH was more successful than planned. Asa
result of investing in products and due to the difficult
sales conditions, the other product companies made
slight or even negative contributions to earnings.

Depreciation and amortisation increased by 16% in
the reporting period to EUR 26.2 million. This devel-
opment was driven by the additional investments in
property, plant and equipment, and the resulting
increase in depreciation and amortisation as well as
depreciation and amortisation from leases. As in the
previous year, no unplanned goodwill impairments
were recognised.

Annual Report 2020

Income from financing and investment activities
came to EUR -2.6 million and was therefore almost
at the level of the previous year (previous year:
EUR -2.2 million). Interest expenses amounting to
EUR 1.6 million associated with leasing arrange-
ments represent a significant driver behind this.

The result before tax (EBT) rose by 36% to EUR 31.6
million and thus was somewhat stronger than the
operating EBITDA result. Income tax expense stood
at EUR -10.7 million (previous year: EUR -5.8 mil-
lion). The effective tax rate came in at 34% (previous
year: 25 %). The higher tax rate is primarily due to tax
revenue for previous years in the amount of EUR 1.4
million being recorded in the previous year. In all, the
consolidated earnings were positive in the amount
of EUR 20.9 million after EUR 17.5 million in the
previous year. The earnings per share were EUR 3.39
after EUR 2.82 in the previous year, corresponding
to arise of 20%.

Order development

Order intake developed positive in 2021. There was
an increase both in the number of possible projects
and licence sales in the pipeline and the volumes
already commissioned, therefore the outlook for
2021 should initially be characterised by growth.
2020 was nota good year for the product companies
inthe IT Solutions segment, but there is a good pipe-
line for 2021, especially for in|sure.

Employee indicators
The leading performance figures for employees
developed as follows:

Financial position

Financial management principles and objectives
adesso pursues a balanced financial policy. The
objective of financial management is to assure
short-term liquidity, including a margin of safety,
as well as to secure and acquire financial assets
to fund medium- and long-term investment
projects. In principle, the company does not enter
into investment transactions with speculative
elements.

There are no variable interest rates on investments.
In light of the zero-percent or even lower invest-
ment interest rates for low-risk investments, the
company invests the existing liquid funds almost
exclusively on a daily basis so that it can flexibly
take advantage of investment opportunities when
they arise.

Central cash management at the level of daily
account clearing has not been set up. Bank borrowing
was centralised with the parent company. The
account balances and financial position of all compa-
nies are transparent to the Group’s Executive Board
and constitute a standard element of the monthly
reporting system. All interest-bearing liabilities are
denominated in euros, except for the 2015 acqui-
sition in Switzerland, which was denominated in
Swiss francs. It is possible for the subsidiary adesso
Schweiz to sell off receivables in exceptional cases
in order to maintain short-term liquidity. Active
factoring is done by the company Solbicon GmbH
(formerly: Solbicon AG) acquired during the finan-
cial year.

Capital structure

The financing of accounts receivable and of not-yet-
invoiced services in the amount of EUR 121.3 mil-
lion (previous year: EUR 108.7 million) represents
the most significant portion of the financing
requirements. The working capital (trade receiva-
bles plus contract assets minus trade payables and
minus contractual liabilities) amounted to EUR 93.9
million (previous year: EUR 85.1 million) as at
31 December 2020. Asa result, the need for advance
financing of business operations rose by 10 % year
on year, while sales increased by 16 %. Among
other things, this below-average increase is due to
improved receivables management.

At EUR 60.7 million, the entire portfolio of inter-
est-bearing financial liabilities was EUR 2.7 million
higher year on year as a result of new intake despite
instalment payments carried out. Interest is fixed
over the respective entire term. All interest-bearing
liabilities are denominated in euros or Swiss francs.
Credit balances are available in the short term. Net
liquidity after deducting the financial liabilities is
EUR -5.6 million (previous year: EUR -11.6 mil-
lion). With a value of -0.1 (previous year: -0.2),
the net liquidity quota in relation to EBITDA is
significantly below the maximum target of -2.0 the
company set itself. Please note that the net liquidity
as at the reporting date of 31 December regularly lies
close to the maximum value over the course ofa year.

In particular, equity increased due to positive Group
results and despite the dividend payment or rather
due to the reporting ofa EUR 10.4 million decrease
of capital reserves for the acquisition of additional
shares in subsidiaries. Due to an increased balance
sheet total of EUR 372.1 million (previous year:
EUR 320.8 million), equity decreased slightly, from
29% in the previous year to 28 %.

Investments, acquisitions and divestments

The adesso business model requires relatively low
investments in property, plant and equipment. The
opening of additional locations as well as further
employee growth made a significant contribution
to the increase in assets and rights of use from leas-
ing activities. There were no significant subsequent
obligations from property, plant and equipment
investment projects as at 31 December 2020. There
is no investment backlog to report.

In the second half of the year, adesso acquired
controlling interests in two company groups.
First, in Bluegroup IT (Nieuwegein/Nether-
lands), which specialises in developing front-end
and back-end software applications for banks
and government institutions. And second, in
Quanto AG (Hameln), which focuses on SAP
technology for various sectors of industry. Along
with the acquisition of Solbicon AG (Dortmund),
a company which works in big data and digitali-
sation for SAP technology, these acquisitions saw
adesso further expand its portfolio in the area of
SAP consulting. Furthermore, at the beginning of
August adesso acquired the business operations of
-.dotkomm (Cologne), an established company in the
field of digital touchpoints and response and conver-
sion optimisation. The new adesso foreign subsid-
iary founded in Hungary in 2019 was reinforced
at the beginning of November by the acquisition of
LeanNetworking Kft. (Budapest), a young trend-
setter in the field of cloud-native technologies. The
acquisition costs paid in cash came to EUR 18.7
million in total. There are also additional agree-
ments covering the acquisition of the shares
remaining in the holdings which have not yet been
acquired in full. A detailed overview is given in
section 4 of the consolidated financial statement,
“Mergers”.

Liquidity

Cash and cash equivalents totalled EUR 55.0 million
on the reporting date (previous year: EUR 46.4 mil-
lion). They were partly offset by financial liabilities,
mainly from acquisition loans, in the amount of
EUR 60.7 million (previous year: EUR 58.0 million).
Net liquidity after deducting the financial liabilities
therefore improved by EUR 6.0 million to EUR -5.6
million.

Cash flow from operating activities stood at EUR 65.0
million (previous year: EUR 22.3 million) and essen-
tially follows the positive development of earnings.
Furthermore, this development is also due mainly to
the increase in net operating assets from EUR -16.8
million to EUR 4.1 million and lower tax payments
(EUR -3.8 million; previous year: EUR -9.9 million)
in the wake of the deferral of income tax prepayments
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Annual Repo

Cash flow from investment activities amounted to
EUR -28.5 million (previous year: EUR -15.4 mil-
lion), which was due in particular to the acquisitions
of and investments in companies made in 2020.

Cash flow from financing activities was EUR -27.5
million compared to EUR -6.5 million in the previ-
ous year. The increase in the negative cash flow was
primarily due to the financial liabilities for refinancing
taken out in the previous year, which did not exist
to the same extent in 2020. Financial liabilities of
EUR 14.4 million (previous year: EUR 11.7 million)
were repaid. The presentation of the repayment of
lease liabilities attributable to IFRS 16 amounted to
EUR 13.8 million compared to EUR 10.6 million the
previous year. Furthermore, dividends of EUR 2.9
million (previous year: EUR 2.8 million) were paid
to shareholders of adesso SE..

Variable salary components are paid out from
cash and cash equivalents and are paid out in the
first few months of 2021. This is typical for the
business. Thus, as in the previous years, the net
liquidity in the first half of the year 2021 is expected
to experience negative developments for the time
being. Overall, the liquidity of the adesso Group is
adequate to carry on current business operations,
for the planned redemption of liabilities and to
compensate for ordinary fluctuations in capacity
utilisation. As of the balance sheet date, adesso SE,
as the central financing company of the adesso
Group, had several available credit lines totalling
EUR 38.9 million.

Assets and liabilities

Total assets as of the balance sheet date increased year
on year by 16%, or EUR 51.4 million, to EUR 372.1
million.

On the assets side, the goodwill increased largely
depending on acquisitions by EUR 10.5 million.
The other intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment also increased, by EUR 15.0 million toa
total of EUR 119.2 million, which is attributable to
the further growth of the adesso Group. Asa result
of the renewed growth in sales, the receivables from
deliveries and services also increased significantly by
EUR 6.6 million, but due to improved receivables
managementat a lower rate than the growth in sales.
Contract assets increased by a further EUR 6.0 mil-
lion to a total of EUR 28.5 million.

On the liabilities side, the leasing liabilities increased
in parallel to the rights of use from leasing activities,
by EUR 7.8 million to a total of EUR 81.2 million.
Despite higher repayments compared to the uptake of
new financial assets, the long-term financial liabilities
increased by EUR 5.7 million to EUR 49.3 million,
mainly due to acquisitions.

Overall statement

The Executive Board had set targets for 2020 of a
sales volume of over EUR 490 million (increased to
over EUR 500 million at the beginning of November)
and an EBITDA of over EUR SO million (increased
to between EUR 55 and 65 million at the begin-
ning of November) as well as an EBITDA margin of
over 10%.

adesso Group sales amounted to EUR 523.4 million
in the reporting period, EBITDA came in at EUR 60.4
million and the EBITDA margin was 11.5%. All
three targets of the (increased) guidance were thus
achieved.

Financial and non-financial performance indicators
The key financial performance indicators used for
internal control of the Group are sales growth,
EBITDA, and EBITDA margin. Furthermore, the
earnings before taxes and amortisation of goodwill
attributable to the business operations of adesso SE
are relevant for the individual financial statements.
Targets and actual values for the reporting period, as
well as for the medium and long-term target corridor
for the adesso Group, are provided in the following
table.

The adesso Group does not use any Group-wide
non-financial performance indicators for the inter-
nal control of the Group. Given the outstanding
importance to the Group of adesso SE, which is
responsible for over 50 % of adesso Group business,
and the otherwise broad range of control-relevant
performance indicators within the Group due to the
business it conducts, the financial and non-financial
performance indicators used for the internal control
of adesso SE are reported on below.

The development of earnings generated by adesso SE
depends on a number of performance indicators. In
addition to the growth rate which is achieved, these
are, in particular:

Annual Report

Employee capacity utilisation (proportion of
employees working on customer projects)

The proportion of employees working on billable
customer projects has a direct influence on earnings.
The greatest possible constant and high utilisation,
without severely limiting flexibility in staffing new
projects, is our goal. Since the end and beginning
of projects cannot always be optimally scheduled
in sequence, some basic non-utilisation of capacity
is unavoidable. Utilisation is measured biweekly
according to the number of employees in operations
and is reported as the proportion of employees that
are not assigned to a project.

2020 again achieved high capacity utilisation rates
with a higher fluctuation margin compared to the
previous year. The value is within the target corridor.

Booking intensity (average of

billed hours per project day)

The number of billable customer hours as the basis
for sales and earnings is subject to fluctuations which
do not depend on the order situation, caused by the
number of potential working days, holidays taken,
illness, and capacity utilisation. When these effects
are neutralised in the analysis of billable customer
hours, it is possible to determine the average billa-
ble customer hours per project day for an employee
assigned to a project, provided that structures remain
unchanged. Changes to structures, such as the man-
agement team, career levels, and working models, are
also included in the booking intensity. The booking
intensity determined this way measures the develop-
ment of quantitative value creation per employee in
the project and structural efficiency.

Since additional or fewer hours worked per project
day are accompanied by virtually unchanged costs,
a change in the booking intensity has a direct impact
on earnings. The booking intensity is also influenced
by the intensity of pursuing internal projects for
company development, business development or
pre-sales. It is specified as a percentage of an eight-
hour workday.

In 2020, the average posting intensity increased
compared to the previous year. It is thus in the central
range of the target corridor.

Average daily rates achieved

The change in the average daily rates, both in projects
billed ona time and materials basis and in fixed-price
projects ona calculation basis, is a key earnings driver.
In particular, compared to the change in labour
cost per employee as the leading cost item, it has a
significant impact on the operating earnings mar-
gin. Accordingly, the daily rates are a fixed internal
control element. Their development is tracked on an
individual customer basis, and they are purposefully
examined for improvement potential. The change in
the average daily rate is reported. In 2020, the daily
rate in projects billed ona time and materials (T&M)
basis decreased slightly by 1%.

Calculated daily rates and budget
overruns for fixed-price projects

The number of project days in fixed-price projects
that exceed the budget has a direct impact on earn-
ings, since those days are not available for otherwise
potential working hours. Even if they can be used only
in combination with projects completed below budget
foran overall image of the impact that fixed-price pro-
jects have on earnings, the change in budget overruns
serves as a signal for progress or setbacks related to
fixed-price projects. This is a qualitative assessment,
as the evaluation is based on days and not on euros.

Together with the daily rates used in project cal-
culations, the under- and over-budget ratio is used
to derive the calculated daily rate on fixed-projects
during post-calculation. Budget overruns in 2020
were below the target corridor and below the previ-
ous year’s figure. The target value for increasing the
imputed daily rate was also not reached in 2020.

adesso SE examines employee aspects as non-financial
performance indicators. Asa fast-growing premium IT
service provider, adesso depends on the ability to gain
many of the best graduates and experienced experts as
new employees, to extensively pursue their internal
further development, and to retain them for as long
as possible. Here the following performance indicators
described are of particular relevance.

Recruiting performance figures and turnover
Recruiting examines the number of applications
received, initial interviews conducted and new hires.
The turnover ratio is based on resignations of per-
manent staff. In 2020, the number of applications
increased significantly once again to 76%, thereby
setting a new record. The fast organic growth was
continued, and thus the number of new positions
filled for permanent employees increased by a further
29%. The turnover ratio declined in 2020 and is now
back within the target corridor of up to 10%.

Management also examines the development of
licence/SaaS and maintenance revenues from the
FirstSpirit product from the subsidiary e-Spirit AG
and from the in|sure product from adesso insurance
solutions GmbH for insurance companies as internal
performance indicators, since licence revenue ina
short-term quarterly and financial year view have a
major direct impact on earnings and because mainte-
nance revenues form the basis for growing the devel-
opmentand marketing cost base of products. Licence/
SaaS revenue fell significantly in 2020 compared to
the very strong performance of the previous year and
remained below the target value as a result. On the
other hand, maintenance revenue was increased by
7 %and the target achieved.

Forecast report

Future macroeconomic situation

The coronavirus crisis in 2020 tipped Germany into
a severe recession with -5.0% growth, following two
previous years of declining growth momentum. In
the face of the new, stricter lockdown measures, the
recovery which had become apparent in the summer
of 2020 paused in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless,
the federal government anticipates that the German
economy will regain momentum in the future if the
coronavirus situation eases, aided by the vaccination
programme. For 2021, the annual forecast sees an
increase in price-adjusted gross domestic product of
3.0% compared to 2020. This represents a significant
downward correction compared to the autumn pro-
jection made at the end of October 2020 (+4.4%), in
which renewed measures required to contain the pan-
demic and the corresponding restrictions were not
yet taken into account. The ministry does not expect
economic performance to return to pre-coronavirus
levels until mid-2022. The picture was still mixed as
at the end of January 2021: while the performance
of industry remained robust, the services sector was
severely affected by the restrictions.

Extensive fiscal measures will continue to help sta-
bilize the economy and secure jobs. The federal gov-
ernment continued to implement the comprehensive
economic programme of June 2020 — with around
EUR 50 billion set aside for new technologies such as
Artificial Intelligence. To cushion losses for employ-
ees paying mandatory social insurance contributions
and prevent a massive increase in unemployment,
the federal government has introduced improved
terms for claiming short-time working allowance. A
fiscal environment that was growth-friendly, interna-
tionally competitive and fair would support a quick
recovery after the crisis. The public and in particular
small and medium-size enterprises would benefit
from tax reliefin 2021 and 2022. The medium- and
long-term competitiveness and innovative ability
of the German economy would be strengthened by
numerous reforms. There could be positive catch-up
effects if some of the purchasing power accumulated
during the lockdown were expended again. If private

households were to increase their consumer spend-
ing more than expected, additional impetus for the
economy would be provided.

The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
(SECO), based on the assessments of a group of gov-
ernment experts, sees the interim economic recovery
interrupted by the second wave of the coronavirus
and, in its most recent forecast from December,
revised the growth expectations for 2021 for sports
event-adjusted GDP down to 3.0% (October 2020:
+3.8%). At 3.1%, a similar level of growth is antic-
ipated for 2022. Growth is expected to pick up
significantly in the course of 2021, and economic
performance in Switzerland is expected to return to
pre-crisis levels by the end of 2021. This forecast is
based on the expectation that the epidemiological
situation will gradually stabilize from spring 2021
in the wake of the widespread use of coronavirus
vaccines. On this assumption, above-average growth
in GDP is to be expected temporarily, as some con-
sumers and investors compensate for spending they
had previously put off.

Based on projections of the Austrian Institute of Eco-
nomic Research (WIFO) and the Austrian Institute
for Advanced Studies (IHS), the Austrian Federal
Ministry for Digitisation and Economic Location
anticipates that GDP will grow again after the signif-
icant downturn in 2020. On the assumption that the
health crisis will come to an end by mid-2021, the
IHS sees the economy growing by 3.1 % and 3.8% in
terms of GDP in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The
WIFO also includes the scenario ofa third lockdown
in its latest estimate made at the end of 2020, and,
depending on the scenario, calculates a wider range
of 2.5% to 4.5 % growth in 2021. The loss of added
value caused by the crisis will not be compensated
for in either scenario until 2022. Growth should then
be 3.5%.

In Turkey, the OECD anticipates GDP growth of 2.6%
in 2021 after a comparatively moderate downturn in
economic performance in the previous year. A further
uplift in momentum is expected to increase growth
to 3.5% in 2022.

For the USA, the OECD predicts growth of 3.2% in
2021 after the recession in the previous year, witha
slight increase to 3.5% in 2022.

For adesso, 2021 represents a return to a more posi-
tive macroeconomic market environment with some
significant growth expectations compared to last
year, and recovery to pre-crisis levels of economic
output. In contrast to the recession of the previous
year, growth is now expected again in all economic
regions relevant to adesso, bar none. In terms of actual
dynamics, any economic growth will depend on the
spread of infection and the measures imposed to
contain the pandemic, and is therefore fraught with
considerable risks.

For its projection, the federal government, is taking
into account the coronavirus pandemic as far as pos-
sible at this time, including an extension of the lock-
down extension until February 2021. Moreover, there
isan explicit assumption that no additional measures
which further restrict economic activity will be
required. Instead, a gradual withdrawal of the meas-
ures from the end of the first quarter is anticipated
in the wake of the ongoing vaccination programme,
although there is still considerable uncertainty about
potential rates of infection. This gives rise to risks for
the development of the wider economy. In addition
to the unpredictable development of the pandemic,
there is a risk that companies will experience liquid-
ity problems despite the support packages offered
in many countries. Risks accruing from the global
economy, including the threat to the stability of
global financial markets, have also increased during
the course of the coronavirus crisis.

Although the global economy is recovering, it is still
overshadowed by the pandemic. Global industrial
production and world trade have increased since last
autumn, but sentiment indicators point to a slow-
down in the recovery. In accordance with forecasts
by international organisations, the global economy
will see growth of 5.3 % this year and 4.2 % in 2022.

Outlook for the industry

According to estimates by the industry association
Bitkom, the German market for providers of services
and products in the IT sector will continue to grow
in 2021 following the pandemic-related temporary
downturn in the previous year. Market volume is
expected to increase by 4.2% to EUR 98.6 billion in
2021. A slump of -0.7 % was recorded in the report-
ing year. The highest growth rates in 2021 will be
in the IT hardware segment, which is forecast to
expand by 8.6 % to EUR 31.6 billion. The software

ENT SERVICE

and IT services sub-segments which are particularly
relevant to adesso will see their market volume grow
by 4.1% to EUR 27.0 billion and by 1.1% to EUR 40.0
billion market volume respectively. IT companies in
Germany are expected to create 20,000 additional
jobs by the end of the year. At the beginning of 2021,
the industry employed 1.2 million people. Bitkom’s
view is that the coronavirus crisis has accelerated the
digitalisation process in many areas. Business, gov-
ernmentand consumers have been investing in digital
technologies, and investors are now catching up with
projects they had previously deferred.

According to the Gartner research institute, global IT
investment is expected to rise by 6.2 % to USD 3.9
trillion in 2021. For IT services, Gartner predicts a
growth rate of 6.0% for 2021 (2020: -2.7 %) to USD
1.1 trillion. The software segmentis set to increase by
8.8% (2020: -2.4%) to USD 0.5 trillion.

Future development of the Group

The foundations for the 2021 financial year are basi-
cally just as good for the service business as 2020,
since with an average of 254 working days, the same
number is available as in the previous year. adesso
also continued to appoint highly qualified employ-
ees during the pandemic, thus creating the potential
for growth. In this respect, it will be essential to
keep capacity utilization at a good level despite any
potential coronavirus-related restrictions. There are
positive signs for the services business, therefore, as
due to the lockdown in Germany there will continue
to be a lower cost base in the area of other operating
expenses.

In addition to this, the pipeline for the product busi-
ness is very strong. Although this may notbe directly
reflected in later orders, it does show that during the
crisis many companies took a wait-and-see approach
to new digitalisation initiatives. This presents oppor-
tunities that will materialise in 2021.

In 2021, adesso is also planning further growth in
the IT Services segment through the recruitment of
personnel. In 2020 alone, there were around 40,000
applications to adesso SE via all channels (recruit-
ment consultants, job advertisements, direct search,
staff recommendations). Of these, several hundred
new employees were appointed, so that adesso can
continue to hire high quality employees who fit in
perfectly with the corporate culture.

In 2021, adesso will expand Corporate Development
and M&A, to the reflect the importance of further
inorganic growth of the adesso Group. Additional
resources will be sought for the core business, along
with increases in other areas of technology such as
SAP, artificial intelligence and cloud development, as
well as companies, with the aim of further strength-
ening the product business in the area of industry
solutions. In addition, the focus of the interna-
tionalisation strategy will be based ona strategy of
acquisition.

No final decision has been made yet on which national
markets are to be developed in this regard. The Exec-
utive Board will continue to move cautiously to
develop a carefully considered expansion strategy in
order to take into account the increasing integration
requirements in the growing adesso Group.

As far as the cost situation is concerned, it is antic-
ipated that other operating expenses will continue
to develop at a lower rate than growth due to the
ongoing pandemic. However, site expansions and
relocations will lead to additional expenses, especially
in large cities such as Berlin and Munich.

The increase in the receivables portfolio is to be
countered by a more consistent system of receivables
management and optimising internal processes in the
administration department.

It is difficult to assess how the economic cycle will
develop. On one hand, many companies have learned
to deal with the crisis, and have adapted their busi-
ness models. Distributed working is also generating
more and more new approaches to digitalisation
initiatives and ideas for using software to improve
corporate processes. On the other hand, lockdowns
and the general level of unpredictability caused by
the pandemic have also created uncertainties. For
example, insurance companies must meet additional
requirements for regulation caused by interruptions
to business. Banks are worried about loan defaults
and the automotive industry is experiencing an eco-
nomic downturn. Opportunities could arise in the
public sector and the healthcare sector, as the federal
government has made schemes and budgets available
here for the digitalisation of the care sector.

Annual Repo

adesso has learned to cope with the crisis and during
the pandemic its business model proved compara-
tively resilient to this type of crisis. The Executive
Board therefore continues to assume that 2021 will
present more opportunities than risks.

Anticipated sales and earnings situation

For the 2021 financial year, adesso anticipates further
growth in the IT Services segment. In IT Solutions,
license sales of the in|sure Ecosphere product family
in particular should pick up again and so contribute
to growth in both sales and earnings.

Management is therefore assuming the following
planning for the 2021 financial year:

> Sales revenue: over EUR 600 million,

> EBITDA: over EUR 72 million,

> EBITDA minimum margin: over 10%.

Segment breakdown follows the pattern of previous
years, in other words approximately 15 % to 20% of
sales come from the IT Solutions segment and the
majority of 80 % to 85 % from IT Services. In terms of
earnings, the IT Solutions segment could again make
a significant contribution, depending on business
performance, if product sales are effected as planned.

Financial outlook

The liquidity situation came in for particular scru-
tiny in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. As
a result, adesso installed its own treasury team. The
term of the additional credit lines negotiated with the
house banks runs until November 2021, so financing
requirements have been secured until then. However,
the structural advantages that existed in 2020, due in
particular to the option of tax deferrals, will no longer
apply in 2021. Instead, there will be an significant
increase in tax prepayments due to the positive busi-
ness performance achieved in 2020.

Furthermore, adesso took advantage of the good
liquidity situation to reduce its net debt despite sev-
eral M&A transactions.

In principle, 2021 should bea typical year for adesso
as far as liquidity is concerned: at the beginning of
the year the liquidity level is high, it will gradually
decrease throughout the first two quarters due to
bonus payments for the previous year and dividends,
and then increase again in the second half. As new
locations are to be opened in 2021 and the extensions

completed in Munich and Berlin, cash outflow is also
anticipated here.

adesso will therefore continue to apply itself inten-
sively to the issue of receivables management. The
initial successes in the reporting year will provide
the foundation for further work. Strategic financing
options to improve working capital will continue to
be discussed with the house banks. adesso remains
true to its basic principle of striving to achieve a net
level of debt between zero- and two-times EBITDA.

The Executive Board will continue to implement the
dividend policy with the aim of providing a reasona-
ble balance between investment in growth, financial
stability and the participation of shareholders in the
success of the company. A steady slight increase in the
dividend is part of adesso’s capital market strategy.
The proposal for 2021 provides for an increase in
the dividend to EUR 0.52 per share for financial year
2020 (previous year: EUR 0.47 per share).

Risk report

Risk management system

Risk management is a pivotal component ofall deci-
sions and business processes. adesso takes a broad
view of risk, defined as the risk of not achieving
financial and operating targets as planned and, in the
strictest sense, factors endangering the existence of
the company. In order to safeguard the success of the
company over the long term, it is therefore essential
that adesso identifies and analyses risks efficiently
and combats or mitigates them by implementing
sufficient control measures. adesso’s active risk
management therefore also opens up opportunities
for the company.

The adesso Group possesses a system of processes
and data analysis structures to monitor risks posed
to the Group. An exclusive risk management software
system is not used. Instead, adesso relies on central
management reporting for results controlling and
tracking additional key figures. All planned and actual
data from all business areas are stored in a central
file for the purposes of reporting. Current figures
are recorded directly from the company’s financial
accounting. Key performance indicators such as sales
per employee, available liquidity, resources not fully
utilised, incoming orders and the order backlog are
registered. All companies included in the scope of
consolidation are part of the reporting system.

Fixed reporting channels have been established for
other risks, such as those arising from the absence of
contracts, high levels of receivables from customers
or projects that are threatening to go over budget. Cer-
tain reporting thresholds apply, which, if breached,
result in the issue being included on the agenda of
Executive Board meetings. Similar risks posed to
companies in the adesso Group are identified through
close cooperation with the respective responsible
Executive Board member of adesso SE. adesso does
not have a central risk manager. Risk reporting and
assessment are documented ina risk manual. The risk
manual is submitted to the Supervisory Board and to
the auditor so that the risk management system can
be acknowledged and reviewed.

Within the scope ofa risk inventory, the following
risks were assessed as relevant to the business and
subsequently assessed in view of their probability
of occurrence and amount of loss. In principle, only

risks that would have negative implications for the
asset, financial or profit situation are listed here.

Moreover, the adesso Group is potentially exposed
to further risks which may not be known or be con-
sidered as major risks at the current time. The risk
factor is calculated from the probability of occurrence
and the amount of loss, which determines how rel-
evant the risk is. The following risks were identified
as at the reporting date and as at the preparation of
the consolidated management report as having a
risk factor worthy of inclusion in this report (greater
than 40):

Primary risk carriers

COVID-19 pandemic

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread
worldwide since December 2019 and has been clas-
sified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as
a pandemic. The virus appeared in almostall regions
of the world and has had lasting negative effects on
the global economy. In 2020, COVID-19 paralysed
social life and crippled large areas of the economy in
much of Europe and Germany. The restrictions will
continue into 2021.

The adesso Group as well as the main core industries
of the adesso Group came through the 2020 financial
year robustly under the difficult market and social
conditions. adesso is monitoring the situation very
closely and has taken various precautionary measures
in 2020. These include rules of conduct for employ-
ees, the implementation of short-time working
during some months in 2020 and arrangements
for mobile working. A crisis committee has already
been set up called “resilience@adesso”, which reports
directly to the Executive Board. Major internal and
external events have been cancelled or changed to
other formats.

Project risks

In the event of the budgeted time frame and costs
being exceeded, fixed-price projects can lead to pro-
ject-related losses.

Budget deviations are identified and analysed con-
stantly during every fixed-price project. There is
also an escalation mechanism that extends to the
Executive Board. adesso uses an Excel-based system
for project controlling and reporting, drawing on
data from the ERP system. Depending on the project

45

adesso Group

Annual Report

020

structure, sub-projects are defined and mapped on
adesso’s web-based project and schedule manage-
ment system. Expenses are distributed across the
sub-projects and milestones are defined. Over the
course of the project, actual time and expenses are
compared with planning figures, the expenses are
calculated and compliance with the defined sched-
ule is documented. Additional monthly or weekly
assessments of work still to be completed are used
to calculate the level of completion of the project
currently in progress. By comparing the level of
completion and the remaining expenses, any poten-
tial budget deviations can be identified at an early
stage. Projects that are likely to exceed the budget
are given “overspend” status and are then added to
the agenda of subsequent Executive Board meetings.
Aside from acknowledging the risk, the Executive
Board meeting also discusses potential strategies to
improve the situation by analysing the reasons for the
overspending. However, the share of projects with
fixed budgets in the form of service contracts in terms
of overall adesso sales is low, at under 20 %. adesso SE
has established a Project Management Office (PMO)
where experts supervise particularly large or chal-
lenging projects using standardised tools and mech-
anisms alongside the regular project management
team. These tools and processes are routinely used.
The estimations of remaining costs are determined
and cost development displayed as a graph in order to
counteract the tendency that project inconsistencies
are identified too late. Similar or identical processes
are in use in various adesso Group companies.

Risks from a shortfall in planned sales

In the event ofa high gross margin and a large propor-
tion of fixed costs, low sales can be directly reflected
in adesso’s results. However, a decline in order intake
or the termination of important ongoing customer
orders could result in idle periods with correspond-
ing implications for the profit and financial situation
within a short period of time. Since the IT Services
business area in particular generates business over
specific periods of time, such idle periods are difficult
to compensate for.

As this risk factor is highly relevant to the company,
adesso monitors the following values on a monthly
and sometimes biweekly basis in order to identify
trends at an early stage and take corresponding
action: order intake, number of hours invoiced and
capacity utilisation rates and number of employees
not working at full capacity.

The IT Solutions segment pursues a product
strategy. In this segment, even standard solutions
developed by adesso are sold and implemented
through licensing with maintenance contracts or
provided with software as a service (SaaS). While
the established base of maintenance contracts
represents a relatively stable basis for sales, the
achievement of targets and the results of product
companies are reliant on order intake and are much
more volatile than the service business, given the
low number of new licences sold. Sales revenues
from maintenance activities do not cover total
ongoing costs at any of the adesso Group companies.
Asaresult, the product companies’ licence sales and
new SAAS contracts and the related sales pipelines
are monitored in detail in terms of structure and
development over time.

As part of the monthly reporting cycle, current
figures are compared with the planned outcomes
and results from the previous year and a revised
forecast is created. This allows shortfalls in planned
sales to be identified early on and forms the basis
for the monthly discussions on current business
performance and the outlook for the future. This
applies to all major companies of the adesso Group.

In the past three financial years, adesso SE and the
adesso Group have exceeded their sales targets. This
included the depressed market environment of 2020
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for IT
services will continue in adesso’s core industries in
2021. Germany’s digital association, Bitkom, antic-
ipates sector growth, coupled with catch-up effects
from previously deferred investment measures.

Financial risks

General liquidity risks: The adesso Group’s
liquidity situation is subject to annual fluctuations
which are typical for the business. There are higher
payments in the first half of the year, resulting from
factors including the payment of variable salary
components for the previous year, adjustment of
tax prepayments due to increases in company profit
and the dividend payment. The first half of the year
regularly contains fewer working days compared
to the second half, and this is directly reflected in
sales in the IT Services segment. These effects cause
a drop in the net cash position of the adesso Group
within the first half year results. By contrast, in
the second half of the year, the net cash position
increases steadily. Another seasonal effect is that the
fixed-price projects tend to reach the approval and
final invoicing stages in the second half of the year.

Allaccount balances, loans and unavailable cash are
reported on a monthly basis for liquidity tracking.
Changes in financial resources over a period of
time are visualised. The net cash position of each
major Group company is calculated every month
and shown in the report. adesso SE’s incoming
payments are monitored on a daily basis.

To compensate for liquidity shortfalls, adverse or
unexpected developments, there are bank credit
lines in sufficient amounts which are firmly
committed and freely available. In 2020, additional
bank lines were agreed with the house banks as a
precaution against the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, but these were not used in 2020 due to
the continued robust liquidity situation.

Liquidity risks from major projects: Liquidity
risks can arise from the payment terms of a service
agreement for a completed project witha significant
volume. In addition to prepayments and instal-
ments, payments are often linked to the completion
of the project. In the case of delayed completion,
significant liquidity shortfalls can arise. The CFO
includes major receivables on the part of adesso SE
in the agenda of Executive Board meetings, where
individual strategies for collection are determined.
Due to the growth in recent years, the dependency
on individual projects has decreased, however.

Risks from payment defaults: The open items from
trade receivables are a key asset item on the balance
sheet and make up the majority of tied-up capital.
A payment default leads directly to equivalent nega-
tive effects on earnings and liquidity. At adesso,
receivables management is handled at company
level by the individual companies. The development
of the receivables portfolio and incoming payments
is continuously monitored at adesso SE. In 2020,
the dunning processes were streamlined and there
are channels for escalation to the Executive Board.

Risks from the utilisation of losses: As part of the
review into the allocation of costs of the market
Jaunch and entry of the FirstSpirit content manage-
ment system in the US, it was determined within
the scope of an arm’s length comparison that the
adesso Group company e-Spirit AG must bear
significant shares of the losses that were incurred
and continue to be incurred by the US subsidiary
e-Spirit Inc. (categorised as a limited-risk distrib-
utor). For the years 2011 to 2020, the market entry
compensation invoiced to e-Spirit AG by e-Spirit
Inc. amounted to USD 12.2 million. This resulted in
areduction in the total tax burden of e-Spirit AG as
a sub-group and of the adesso Group. The reported
tax rate for e-Spirit AG and the adesso Group would
be too low in the event of an incomplete recogni-
tion.

Currency risks: adesso companies are exposed to
tisks associated with changes in exchange rates
when they enter into transactions which will
produce cash flows in foreign currencies. The
foreign currency risk is offset to some extent by
the fact that incoming and outgoing payments are
made in the same foreign currency. Currency risks
remain low. Only a small proportion of sales are
conducted in a currency other than the euro. This
mainly concerns transactions involving adesso’s
foreign subsidiaries in Switzerland and Turkey,
which invoice in Swiss francs or Turkish lira, as
well as e-Spirit in the US, which operates in the US
dollar currency zone. These companies process the
majority of their business in the respective national
currency. No currency hedging transactions were
carried out.

There were no notable risks from financial instru-
ments.

Personnel risks

adesso is an IT company without any notable fixed
assets. The company’s most important assets are
its employees. The search for suitable, experienced
employees remains characterised by a demand surplus
from companies. As in the past, the resulting entry-
level salary expectations expressed by new recruits, as
wellas existing employees’ expectations regarding pay
rises, cannot always be compensated through a corre-
sponding adjustment of market prices, meaning that
the operating margin can be negatively impacted as a
result. A small number of employees are responsible
for adesso’s outstanding position in its core indus-
tries. The simultaneous departure of more than one of
these employees would expose the company to medi-
um-term risks in terms of its further development.

Asa result, adesso constantly monitors and assesses a
number of key performance indicators such as head-
count, number of unproductive employees, number
of employees on sick leave and holiday, costs/sales per
employee and capacity utilisation. The top-level man-
agement is always informed about every dismissal and
new recruit. The Executive Board regularly analyses
trends and discusses measures in its meetings every
three months. This allows any potential loss of knowl-
edge and expertise to be identified promptly. In the
product segments, essential knowledge is concentrated
around a small group of key developers. These develop-
ers are a particular focus of human resources activities.

adesso is able to maintain its position as a premium IT
service provider thanks to its extraordinarily talented
employees, who have a vast amount of experience in
their respective fields. Competitors in this area continue
to increase their headcounts — not simply IT service
providers, but also between user companies and the
IT industry. Such risks are combated through active
recruiting, strategies to intensify employee loyalty
and excellent career prospects ata prospering company.

In 2020, adesso SE succeeded in significantly increas-
ing the number of incoming applications again and
keeping the number of hires at a high level. The fluc-
tuation rate was kept consistently below the target
of 10% in 2020.

Risks from business activities

in other legal systems

The adesso Group has expanded internationally
in past years and entered new legal systems. This
involves potential risks related to a lack of knowl-
edge of legal affairs and business practices, as
well as the difficulties with direct supervision by
adesso SE’s Executive Board caused by distance. The
risk associated with internationalisation or risks in
other legal systems was given a higher rating in the
risk inventory for the fourth quarter of 2019 and
in view of the defined strategy of continuing the
internationalisation process. The respective risks
are countered in particular by deploying managers
with expert knowledge and working locally with
legal advisors. The increasing experience in dealing
with the international Group structure also helps to
minimize risk. Due to the additional acquisitions of
foreign companies, the assessment of the extent of
the risk is maintained.

Risks from the development of

new products and solutions

In 2012, the adesso Group significantly increased
its investment in the development of new products
and solutions and therefore gradually shifted the
risk profile of its heavily service-oriented business
model in favour of its product business. To this end,
extensive development projects are up and running
and the already available systems are being widely
marketed. All these products involve increasing
risk from service and maintenance obligations. In
the development phase, there is also increased risk
from the higher-than-planned development costs,
for which adesso is partially responsible. However,
these risks are offset to an increasing extent by
income from licences and maintenance.

Risks from technical infrastructure

Asan IT company, adesso SE has extensive techni-
cal expertise and resources in the area of internal IT
infrastructure. Since a large part of customer-relevant
added value is created on the basis of IT infrastruc-
ture, the availability of the latter is of considerable sig-
nificance. System failure therefore entails a significant
financial risk. The internal IT operations department
is equipped with full-time administrators who are
supported by several trainees, students and other
employees from operational areas. Disciplinary
and organisational responsibility are addressed in
a separate management position. In 2016, the new
position of CISO (chief information security officer)
was established and staffed at adesso SE. The data on
the production servers is incrementally backed up on
suitable media on a daily basis at a third-party loca-
tion away from the data centres.

The production systems available on the Internet
are protected against unauthorised access via a mul-
ti-level firewall system, and adesso operates a VPN
to protect communication between the branches and
subsidiaries. All systems have virus scanners from
various product manufacturers whose virus signa-
tures are automatically updated to comply with the
latest standards.

Atits main office in Dortmund, adesso has a data cen-
tre with safety procedures such as electronic access
control, temperature-controlled server racks, fire
extinguishing systems, uninterrupted power supply
and flood protection. All external data connections
are secured in compliance with the relevant technical
standards and are redundantly structured. Some of
the holding companies have their own IT systems
and departments. Their risk statuses are not reported
to adesso SE in any regular form. adesso is working
towards an increasingly interconnected collaboration
between the IT departments at adesso and the hold-
ings. adesso has been certified to ISO 9001 and ISO
14001. The processes that have been documented
and more strictly defined have maintained a constant
risk position in terms of technical infrastructure
in spite of increasing complexity. In the previous
period, customers’ increasing awareness regarding
data protection and data integrity was assessed as an
increasing risk. This was especially true for banks and
insurance companies as a result of extended regula-
tion requirements and a rise in cyber risks.

Other risks

The risk manual specifies a number of other risks as at
the balance sheet date, where the risk factor is below
40 points. These risks are:

> risks from falling order backlog

> risks from insufficient sales pipeline

> risksfromchangetomarketandcompetitionstructure
> risks from falling market volume

> risks from incorrect products or lack of expertise

> risks from the customer structure

> declining or insufficiently increasing daily rates

> compliance risks

> risks from the organisational structure

> risks from bank credit lines

> risks from lack of insurance cover

Overall Statement Concerning the Group’s

Risk Situation

Every risk is evaluated by estimating the probability
of occurrence and the possible extent of damage. The
risk factor of every risk can be calculated by multi-
plying the probability of occurrence (1-10) by the
extent of damage (1-10). The overall risk profile of
adesso, the sum ofall risk factors, is assessed as having
tisen by 62 points or 12% compared to the previous
year to 588 points. Key drivers for this development
particularly include the new risk from the COVID-
19 pandemic and the increase in risk factors from the
technical infrastructure and the finance risks.

None of the identified risks can be considered at the
current point in time as risks that endanger the exist-
ence of the company as a going concern. However, the
risks detailed above could have a negative impact on
the asset, financial and earnings situation.

The Executive Board of adesso SE anticipates the
identified risks to be limited and manageable. No
risks are detected that by themselves or in the over-
all examination could endanger the existence of the
company.

Annual Report 2020

Opportunities report

In addition to the identification and management
of risks, identifying and developing opportunities
for the advancement of the adesso Group is also an
important area of focus for the management. Various
formats and working groups exist for the systematic
development of new business opportunities, made
up of the Executive Board, business development, the
management teams of Group companies and line-of-
business managers. In these formats, new ideas and
business models are developed for existing or new
industries, solutions and regions developed.

Anincreasingly important element of this work is the
integration of inorganically acquired companies or
parts of companies. In order to expand these activities
and to manage integration activities, adesso intends
to establish a new “Corporate Development and
M&A” division in 2021, which will mainly deal with
the further development of the group of companies.

The expansion of Corporate Account Management,
set up in 2019, is also seeing its first positive results.
For example, it is a major success factor for the adesso
brand to present customers with a “One adesso”
portfolio, to not only be able to offer a small section
of the portfolio but also place the now expansive soft-
ware engineering and technology competence with
customers in their entirety.

From the management’s point of view, the need for
new digitalisation initiatives will continue to increase
in the coming business period, as well as in the years
to come. The coronavirus pandemic is proving itself
here to be a kind of catalyst for new topics to be
addressed by many customers after the uncertainties
of the crisis have been overcome. In this, adesso bene-
fits from its manufacturer independence and operate
asa genuine digitalisation partner to help companies
digitise their core processes. For example, the use of
artificial intelligence is being expanded and estab-
lished in more and more business applications. The
field of SAP will see many projects involving conver-
sions to SAP S/4HANA in the next five to ten years,
an area in which adesso expanded massively at the end
of 2020. But there are also a great many opportunities
in the traditional areas of individual developmentand
consulting and support for digitalisation initiatives.

The sectors in which adesso operates all face these
challenges. Insurance and banking are heavily
involved in replacing old legacy systems. The
healthcare and public sectors are launching initi-
atives to introduce more digital processes to care
and administrative services. Traditional industry
is also investing in digitalisation and IoT projects.
Only the automotive industry is tending to offer
below-average opportunities, due to the current
economic situation.

Internal Control System
and Risk Management
System in Terms of the
Consolidated Accounting
Process

In the accounting process, there is a risk that the
financial reports based on the accounts could contain
misrepresentations of facts that could havea significant
influence on decisions made by the intended recipients
of the reports.

These can include the misallocation of resources and
non-performance of certain measures by the Execu-
tive Board in terms of the internal operational man-
agement of the Group, as well as misinterpretation on
the part of report recipients, particularly existing and
potential shareholders. The processes and systems
established at adesso are geared towards identifying
potential sources of errors in the accounting pro-
cess and thus limiting the resulting risks. They are
intended to ensure that the annual report and consol-
idated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with legal requirements. The report follows a stand-
ardised form for the consolidated management report
of both adesso SE and the adesso Group.

Atadesso, no control and risk management system was
defined and documented especially for the purposes of
the accounting process. There is no internal auditing
structure or risk committee. No external advisors or
auditors were regularly engaged to review the efficien-
cy of the controls in place as part of the consolidated
accounting process.

An IT audit takes place every year as part of the audit
of the annual financial statements. It focuses on the
effectiveness of IT controls with regard to the account-
ing-related ERP system.

The structure of the internal control mechanisms and
risk management system is primarily the result ofhow
the accounting and reporting processes are organised.
Accounting is typically handled locally by each of the
Group’s subsidiaries. As the parent company, adesso SE
performs accounting services for some adesso Group
companies together with centralised administrative
processes such as payroll accounting. These compa-
nies’ accounts are primarily kept on a conventional
accounting system as clients. The fact that the same
people are responsible for this process throughout the
Group and that the adesso SE CFO has ongoing, direct
access provides a good basis for the standardised, correct
representation of facts.

Astandardised Group system of accounts is in place, to
which the local account systems are transferred as part
of the group reporting process This allows deviations
from the desired method of presentation to be traced
transparently and minimised. The detailed coverage of
Group accounts means that it is simple to coordinate
internal Group performance processes. The respective
management teams are responsible for individual
annual financial statements. Each annual financial
statement that forms part of the consolidated financial
statement is reviewed by the Group auditor in terms of
its plausibility and compliance with Group standards,
irrespective of any audits performed by the local auditor
or tax consultant. For this purpose, the auditor of the
consolidated financial statements visits the respective
local auditor and inspects the documentation of key
Group companies.

All individual financial statements are submitted toa
centralised consolidation system in adesso SE’s Finance
department and consolidated into the consolidated
financial statement in accordance with the IFRS rec-
onciliation statement. The software solution specially
procured for this purpose was audited and certified in
accordance with the “Erteilung und Verwendung von
Softwarebescheinigungen” auditing standards (“Issu-
ance and Use of Software Certificates”) published by the
Institut der Wirtschaftprufer in Deutschland e.V. (IDW
PS 880). All IFRS reconciliation and consolidation
processes are fully documented and traceable.

The core elements of the control and risk management
system when it comes to accounting is the monthly
reporting of monthly financial statements, the com-
parison of actual data with plan data and the repeated
updates to the full-year forecast. A member of the ades-
so SE Executive Board is directly responsible for every
company in the adesso Group. These Executive Board
members discuss monthly financial statements with
the respective company management andare thus able
to identify abnormal developments and discrepancies
ina timely manner. The monthly financial statements
ofall companies are analysed monthly by the adesso SE
Executive Board. For the quarterly financial statements,
each company must prepare an extensive IFRS package
containing information for consolidation and details
of the notes. This allows the Finance department of
adesso SE to carry outa further audit ofall information
intended for external reporting during the financial
year. The auditor of the consolidated financial statement
is referred to for selected issues.

Takeover-relevant
information

adesso SE reports in accordance with Section 315a
(1) HGB and Section 289a (1) HGB with the aim of
providing potential takeover bidders with a complete
overview of adesso as well as any potential takeover
hurdles before they submit an offer.

There is only one type of share. Each common share
grants one vote. adesso shares do not have restricted
transferability. The Executive Board is authorised

Supplementary report on
the individual financial
statements of adesso SE

Business activity

In the adesso Group, adesso SE occupies the central
position as by far the largest operating company and
is assigned to the IT Services segment.

The IT Services segment focuses on industry-specific
IT consulting and software development. Consult-
ing develops concepts for the optimum and efficient
support of business processes through IT systems.
The software development department primarily
implements these IT systems in the context of indi-
vidual projects in its own capacity or working with
the customers’ teams.

In addition, as the management company of the
adesso Group, adesso SE directly or indirectly
holds the shares in the companies belonging to the
adesso Group.

Employees

As at 31 December 2020, adesso SE employed
a total workforce of 3,482 (including trainees)
compared to 2,479 at the same time in the previ-
ous year. Employee growth was therefore 1,003
or 40% (previous year: growth of 387 or 18%).
The mergers of three subsidiaries (smarthouse
adesso financial solutions GmbH, gadiv GmbH
and Arithnea GmbH) implemented in 2020 led to
the transfer of 442 employees to adesso SE. These
are included in the figures above. Excluding merg-
ers, 697 new permanent employees were hired in
2020. At +29 %, this represents a significant increase
compared to the same period of the previous year.

Converted to full-time equivalents (FTE), the aver-
age number of employees was 2,838 (previous year:
2,097). This corresponds to an increase of 35 %. 10%
of the employees are assigned to the administration
department (excluding sales) (previous year: 11%).

adesso Group

Annual Repo

In line with the strategy of strengthening the loca-
tions away from the Dortmund headquarters, the
number of employees was increased at all locations in
Germany. adesso SE is a premium IT service company
and pursues an ambitious recruitment and personnel
development policy. adesso has won several awards
as one of the 100 best employers in Germany in the
nationwide company competition organised by the
renowned Great Place to Work ® Institute Germany.
Recruitment, employee development and loyalty are
taken very seriously at adesso.

Economic situation

Profitability

In 2020, sales came in at EUR 374.8 million,
33 % above the previous year’s level. Sales with
customers outside the Group rose by EUR 97.7
million (+38 %), while sales with affiliated compa-
nies saw a fall of EUR 5.5 million (-24%). This
reverse trend was largely attributable to the merger
on 1 January 2020 of three subsidiaries (smarthouse
adesso financial solutions GmbH, gadiv GmbH
and Arithnea GmbH) into adesso SE which was
accounted for retroactively in the balance sheet.

In 2019, the three merged companies generated
sales totaling EUR 50.1 million. Of this amount,
sales with adesso SE accounted for EUR 8.1 million.
In turn, adesso SE generated a total of EUR 3.3
million in sales with these three subsidiaries in the
2019 financial year. If the comparative basis of the
previous year's sales is adjusted accordingly, this
results in sales growth of EUR 53.5 million or 17 %.

Once again, the increase in sales was substantially
above market growth in the market segments rele-
vant for adesso. The basis for the strong growth was
laid by the significant increase in the number of
employees in previous years and continued in 2020.
2020 saw a continuation of recruitment efforts and
the number of new hires reached a new record high.
The average number of employees, converted to
full-time equivalents, rose in the reporting year by
741 or 35 % to 2,838 (previous year: increase of 381
or 22 %). The growth in sales was achieved organ-
ically through the expansion of customer relation-
ships and by increasing the product portfolio. At

the same time, the strategy of forced decentralised
growth led to additional impulses for growth and
consolidation of regional customer relationships.

The overall performance, including the change
in projects started, which is relevant to the eval-
uation of commercial business activities during
the reporting period, saw an increase of 34% to
EUR 383.4 million.

Other operating income stood at EUR 4.4 million,
compared to EUR 2.7 million the previous year.
Details of the distribution of operating income are
included in the notes.

Expenditure on materials amounting to EUR 73.2
million (previous year: EUR 56.3 million) related
primarily to services purchased externally or from
associated companies in connection with customer
projects. Only EUR 1.5 million (previous year:
EUR 0.7 million) was for merchandise, mainly soft-
ware licenses. The merchandise was also primarily
purchased for adesso customer projects. The share
of material expenditure in the overall performance
‘was one percentage point lower year on year at 19%.

By contrast, the proportion accounted for by
personnel costs rose by two percentage points
to 60%. Personnel costs increased by 38% to
EUR 224.9 million overall in the wake of further
organic expansion of the workforce and the merger
of three subsidiaries into adesso SE. Gross profit
per employee remained constant at EUR 109 thou-
sand. Personnel costs per employee increased from
EUR 2 thousand to EUR 79 thousand. Gross profit
came in at EUR 310.2 million overall, an increase of
35 % over the same period in the previous year. The
proportion of the overall performance accounted for
by gross profit increased by one percentage point
to 81%.

Other operating expenses rose by only 1.7 %in 2020
to EUR 52.6 million. The proportion of the overall
performance accounted for by these cost items
therefore fell by four percentage points to 14 %. This
trend is mainly attributable to the decrease in travel
and event expenses as a result of COVID-19. It was
countered by an increase in the costs for premises,
recruitment and marketing.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL S

MENT — SERVICE

Thanks in particular to the further growth in sales,
operating income (EBITDA = earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization)
increased by 115% to EUR 37.1 million.

Depreciation and amortisation increased overall by
70% in the reporting period to EUR 9.9 million.
Here, there was an increase in regular depreciation
and amortisation of fixed and intangible assets e.g.
IT equipment and software licences in use, as well
as the depreciation and amortisation of lesser-value
commodities, totalling EUR 5.0 million (previous
year: EUR 3.9 million) and accounting for one per-
centage point of the overall performance, as was the
case in the previous year. Depreciation and amortisa-
tion of goodwill rose by EUR 2.3 million to a total of
EUR 4.2 million. In addition to the depreciation and
amortisation of goodwill in the amount of EUR 1.3
million already in place in previous years from the
merger with BOV AG, there was further depreci-
ation and amortisation on the goodwill applied to
smarthouse adesso financial solutions GmbH in the
amount of EUR 2.0 million and Arithnea GmbH in
the amount of EUR 1.0 million in connection with
the mergers of 01/01/2020 which were accounted
for retrospectively in the balance sheet. In addition,
the latter two mergers resulted in the recognition of
intangible assets from order backlog, customer lists
and software, which also led to additional deprecia-
tion and amortisation amounting to EUR 0.6 million.

Income from participations covers revenue from
investments, appreciation and depreciation of finan-
cial assets, and revenue from profit and loss transfer
agreements, especially revenue from the profit and
loss transfer agreements with adesso mobile solu-
tions GmbH and e-Spirit AG. It came to EUR 2.2 mil-
lion (previous year: EUR 3.6 million). Income from
financing activities amounted to EUR -0.2 million
compared to EUR -0.4 million in the previous year.

Overall, this led toa significantly higher pre-tax profit
of EUR 29.1 million (previous year: EUR 14.7 mil-
lion) and net income for the year of EUR 18.8 million
(previous year: EUR 12.8 million).

Assets and liabilities

As at the balance sheet date, the balance sheet total
showed an increase due to the further growth of
16% to EUR 255.4 million. On the assets side,

current assets in particular increased by EUR 20.8
million or 18 %, while fixed assets also saw a signif-
icant increase of EUR 14.5 million or 15%.

The financing of accounts receivable with external
customers and not-yet-invoiced services in the
amount of EUR 94.1 million (previous year:
EUR 73.8 million) represents the most significant
portion of the financing requirements. As at the
balance sheet date, the amount of advance payments
received showed a year-on-year increase as an oper-
ational source of finance from EUR 15.5 million to
EUR 19.6 million. Working capital as the difference
between trade receivables and inventories and the
advance payments received and made, rose by 25%
to EUR 88.2 million due to the significantly higher
business volume.

At EUR 38.0 million (previous year: EUR 66.0
million), shares in associated companies represent
the largest financing requirement for fixed assets.
The share of this item in the balance sheet total fell
from 30% in the previous year to 15 %. This was
essentially due to the merger-related disposal of the
investment book values in smarthouse adesso finan-
cial solutions GmbH, gadiv GmbH and Arithnea
GmbH. On the other hand, the mergers led to a
recognition of goodwill in the amount of EUR 29.3
million and recognition of intangible assets in the
amount of EUR 2.5 million.

Investment analysis

The adesso business model requires relatively low
investments in property, plant and equipment
for its ongoing operations. They consist largely of
hardware such as laptops and servers, development
systems including software, the ERP system, as
well as office furnishings. The relevant additions to
operating and office equipment, including advance
payments made, came to EUR 7.3 million compared
to EUR 6.0 million the previous year. The increase is
in line with the expansion of the employee base and
the additional investment in the interior fittings of
the new location in Potsdam as well as the capacity
expansion of the locations in Munich and Berlin. In
addition, the mergers of three subsidiary companies
disclosing resulted in the disclosure of more addi-
tions to historical purchasing costs and accumulated
amortisation. Details relating to this can be found in
the notes and statement of assets.

adesso Group

Annual Rep

The acquisitions carried out in 2020 and the crea-
tion of new subsidiaries resulted in the receipt of
shares in affiliated companies and investments in
the amount of EUR15.2 million. The relevant addi-
tions relate in particular to the acquisition of the
Quanto Group in December 2020. There were also
additions of EUR 12.0 million to loans to affiliated
companies and participations, which were mainly
loans granted to the foreign subsidiaries in the Neth-
erlands and Spain as well as the newly established
subsidiary adesso experience GmbH.

Financial position

Equity stands at EUR 101.1 million, showing an
increase of EUR 16.1 million or 19% year on year.
This development is due in particular to the net
income for the year of EUR 18.8 million. In June
2020, a dividend of EUR 0.47 per share was paid
(previous year: EUR 0.45), resulting in a corre-
sponding reduction in equity of EUR 2.9 million
(previous year: EUR 2.8 million). The equity ratio
improved by one percentage point to 40%. The
subscribed capital remained almost unchanged at
EUR 6,185,343.

Liquidity and financing analysis

Cash and cash equivalents totalled EUR 28.8 million
on the balance sheet date (previous year: EUR 30.2
million). They are partly offset by interest-bearing
liabilities, mainly from several acquisition loans, in
the amount of EUR 49.1 million (previous year:
EUR 57.3 million). This includes EUR 2.0 million
(previous year: 0.6 EUR million) froma loan from
an affiliated company. As at the balance sheet date,
several credit lines are available amounting to a total
of EUR 38.9 million. The interest rates on the loans
are fixed over the entire term. The credit is available
at short notice.

Cash and cash equivalents include larger items that
are typical of the business and are due for payment
in the first few months of 2021. The largest items
are the variable salary components to be paid out
in the first quarter of 2021, and profit sharing for
the employees and the Executive Board for 2020.
Overall, liquidity is assessed as being adequate
to carry on current business operations, for the
planned redemption of liabilities and to compen-
sate for ordinary fluctuations in capacity utilisation.
The performance-related range of fluctuation in the
variable salary components forms an additional
buffer to cushion potential declines in earnings and
the associated outflow of liquidity.

Overall statement on
business performance by
the management

Business performance in 2020 can be considered very
positive overall. adesso’s business model proved to
be sufficiently resilient to the crisis triggered by the
coronavirus pandemic. Key to this was the ability to
carry on the business through distributed work using
modern infrastructure and collaboration tools. It was
also a stroke of good fortune to have a customer base
that was itself less severely affected by the crisis.

Outlook

The report on risks and opportunities is a pivotal part
of the management’s considerations of the further
development of adesso SE and of the forecast report.

The employment policy, which is geared towards
above-average growth, will continue to be followed.
The plan sees sales increase further to over EUR 410
million in 2021. The forecast for profit attributable to
the business operations of adesso SE before taxes and
amortisation of goodwill in 2021 is EUR 34.4 million
(previous year’s forecast: EUR 23.0 million). With
regard to the non-financial performance indicators, a
fluctuation of <10% is planned for 2021 and an increase
in daily rates of at least 2%. The booking intensity
should be between 83 % and 103 %, the inverse utili-
sation rate between 7 % and 15%.

Remuneration report

Principles of the
remuneration system

Atadesso, variable remuneration systems are in place
throughout the Group fora variety of functions. Man-
agement remuneration is primarily geared toward the
success of the company and industry standards.

Inaddition to fixed remuneration, the adesso SE Exec-
utive Board is compensated depending on the amount
of operating earnings (in reference to EBITDA), as
well as earnings per share at the Group level, con-
stituting performance-based remuneration. The
Executive Board participated in the company-wide
share option scheme open to many employees and
which expired at the end of 2013. This was replaced
by a model of virtual share options for the Execu-
tive Board. Because this model has also expired, no
new virtual share options are being issued. No share
options were granted to members of the Executive
Board from the 2015 share option plan, from which it
similarly has not been possible to issue any new share
options since December 2019.

The members of the Supervisory Board are reim-
bursed for their expenses and also receive annual
remuneration..

Remuneration of members of
the Executive Board

Basic remuneration is paid as a monthly salary and
is related to performance. The members of the Exec-
utive Board also receive payments in kind and other
remuneration, including the use of a company car,
the reimbursement of travel expenses, coverage of
direct insurance premiums, a personal pension and
reimbursement of half the documented premiums for
voluntary health and nursing care insurance.

Variable, performance-based remuneration

The variable remuneration model for the Executive
Board is based directly on the relevant metrics of
EBITDA and earnings per share (EPS), which are
reported to adesso SE shareholders in the consoli-
dated financial statements according to IFRS. Variable
remuneration increases proportionally to EBITDA
and EPS. As ofa defined point, the increase sinks. One
of two different variants, which are differentiated by
the rate of increase and watershed, can be selected
each year in the variously configured contracts. In
addition, individual Executive Board members have
been granted the option of including performance-re-
lated bonuses in the variable compensation, the
amount of which is measured according to the key fig-
ure “adesso SE’s profit before taxes under commercial
law”. This maximum bonus is limited to 15 % of the
fixed remuneration. Exercising this option will reduce
the EBITDA- and EPS-based variable component of
the performance-related remuneration, which is not
subject to any upper limit in principle. More recent
Executive Board contracts dating from 2019 onwards
provide for a cap on the variable remuneration. This
means that the total amount of the variable remunera-
tion derived in accordance with the regulations above
is limited to one times the basic salary.

Annual Report

Long-term remuneration

A phantom share programme for certain members
of the Executive Board and employees at the first
management level of adesso SE was approved by
the Supervisory Board in financial year 2009. It was
intended to help bind managers to the company in
the long term. The phantom shares participate in
dividends just like actual shares but the payments are
included in salaries. After being with the company for
a term of five to eight years, the holders of phantom.
shares have a right to receive the value represented at
the time by the number of phantom shares and the
underlying share price. Payment is included in sala-
ries. In 2017, several entitled parties from phantom
shares, including the two members of the Executive
Board who were entitled at this point in time, agreed
to an adjustment of the regulations. The adjustment
curbed the effect on the Group earnings statement
resulting from changes in the exchange rate above or
below an exchange rate corridor. No further claims
by Executive Board members were derived from
these phantom shares in 2020 as in the two previous
years the Executive Board members who were still
entitled returned their phantom shares after expiry
of the minimum qualifying period in exchange for
salary payment. To do this, relevant accruals had been
formed in the previous periods. Consequently, all
phantom shares which were owned by the Executive
Board are currently compensated for.

Former members of the Executive Board who have
left the company do not receive any remuneration
and were not granted any pension commitments.
No loans or advances were granted to members of the
Executive Board. A former member of the Executive
Board has continued to work in the company as a
manager since 1 July 2015 at adapted terms without
Executive Board membership.

Supervisory Board
remuneration

According to Section 12 of the Articles of Associ-
ation, the members of the Supervisory Board are
reimbursed for their expenses and also receive annual
remuneration. This consists of a fixed component
of EUR 5S thousand, plus variable remuneration
at a rate of 0.275 % of the company’s balance sheet
profit, reduced by 4% of contributions to share cap-
ital. The chairperson receives one and a half times
this remuneration. Supervisory Board members
who have not held their position for a full financial
year receive remuneration according to their term
in office. The chairperson of the Supervisory Board
receives additional remuneration under a consulting
and brokerage agreement.

adesso SE has neither granted loans or advances to
members of the Supervisory Board nor issued bonds
or guarantees on their behalf. There are no family
ties between members of the Supervisory Board,
nor between members of the Supervisory Board and
the Executive Board. There are no service agreements
between the Supervisory Board members and adesso
or its subsidiaries that call for remuneration upon
termination.

For further information regarding Supervisory
Board and Executive Board remuneration, including
detailed tables regarding individual remuneration of
Supervisory Board and Executive Board members,
information pursuant to Section 314 (1) No.6 HGB
and further information pursuant to the German
Corporate Governance Code, refer to the consoli-
dated notes.

The law implementing the second Shareholders’
Rights Directive (ARUG II) and the GCGC as
amended on 16/12/2019 have established new
requirements relating to the remuneration of exec-
utive bodies. In application of the new measures, the
next Annual General Meeting will be presented with
a revised remuneration system for approval which
will be more closely aligned to the company’s goals
and the requirements of its stakeholders.

Appendix

Report on equal opportunities
and equal remuneration

adesso SE considers it extremely important that there
are no differences between remuneration for men
and women. Remuneration is based on personal and
technical qualifications as well as regional differences.
This is also reflected in the lack of demand for individ-
ual entitlements to disclosure as defined in Section 10
of the German Transparency in Wage Structures Act
(Entgelttransparenzgesetz, EntgTranspG). Since the
law entered into force in 2018, there have been 26
requests for information, of which 18 were fulfilled.
The remaining eight requests for information were
unable to be answered due to the terms of Section 12
(3) EntgTranspG, as the comparison group consisted
of fewer than six people.

The number of applications received from female
applicants for software development positions has
increased over the past few years: from 16.5% in
2017 to 17.5% in 2018 and 19.8% in 2019. Asa
consequence, the percentage of female employees
in operative areas has also steadily increased, from
11% in 2016 to 15.8% in 2019.

Two projects have been launched over the past few
years to continue this positive trend moving forward.

The She for IT campaign is geared towards imple-
menting suitable frameworks to increase the percent-
age of female IT specialists even further. Measures
range from coaching initiatives for women in IT, net-
working meetings and events to school sponsorships,
workshops for children and specific programmes for
young women at universities and other higher edu-
cation institutions.

adesso SE is also aware that it is not always easy to
maintain a positive work-life balance in this sector.
The family@adesso project was initiated to create
an environment where family life and work could
be combined harmoniously. For some time, this
has included child- and family-friendly activities at
events and celebrations, childcare during the school
holidays, partnerships with daycare facilities and var-
ious terms of employment that take family needs into
account. In 2019, additional measures were imple-
mented including the ability for parents to reduce
their working hours in conjunction with a regional
deployment, childcare bonuses for children not yet
of school age, child-friendly offices and KidsBoxes
as well as additional annual leave for parents whose
children are starting school. There is also a kids’ pro-
gramme available exclusively to adesso children.
