Moreover, Telefonica has increased its presence in key markets. In 2014 Telefénica acquired E-Plus
(through Telefonica Germany) and in 2015 Telefonica acquired DTS (through Telefonica Spain) and GVT
(through Telefonica Brazil).

On February 10, 2016, Telefénica announced the creation of “Telxius" a company which brings together
certain infrastructure assets of the Group in several countries, which will enable the management of the
Telefonica Group's infrastructure on a global scale with a more specialized and focused approach, with
the aim of increasing the services provided to other operators, improving the return on capital invested
and allowing Telefonica to participate more actively in the growth opportunities that exist in the industry,
including the possibility of incorporating third party assets.

Trend evolution

In 2016, Telefonica made great progress towards long-term sustainable and profitable growth in service
revenues, continuing to increase efficiencies and capturing synergies thanks to the integrated vision of
the businesses, processes and technologies. This allowed us to maintain a strong investment effort in
order to be able to offer our customers excellent connectivity. In recent years, the Company has moved
forward in its business transformation:

Firstly, Telefonica has defined a new business model with data-oriented offers, bundled services,
including converged fixed and mobile services, as well as digital capabilities as part of the global
transformation focused on responding to the change in our customers’ consumer habits. An
essential part of our effort has been the investment in fiber- and LTE networks, which we believe
will allow the monetization of data as well as of digital services. In this way, Telefénica has
significantly increased data accesses, including 82 million smartphones accesses, 4.8 million Pay
TV accesses and 6.6 million fiber accesses during the 2014-2016 period. Additionally, average
revenue per access increased by 2.8% year-on-year over the 2015-2016 period, from a year-on-
year increase of 1.9% over the 2014-2015 period.

Secondly, changing consumer habits have resulted in a decreasing demand for voice services and
an increasing demand for data, due to video downloads and internet connectivity through
smartphones. This new trend has allowed us since 2015 to compensate the drop in voice
revenues (excluding falls in interconnection tariffs) with higher data and service over
connectivity, to be able to start seeing a positive trend in average revenue per access in the
majority of our markets.

Thirdly, Telefonica has reinforced its competitive position thanks to an active management of
the asset portfolio and to the consolidation of its participation in key markets in 2015: Germany
(with the acquisition of E-Plus), Brazil (with the acquisition of GVT) and Spain (with the
acquisition of DTS). These strategic acquisitions in key markets coupled with divestments in
non-strategic markets, have allowed Telefonica to capture significant synergies.

Lastly, Telefonica launched in 2014 a simplification program focused on increasing growth and
capturing synergies across the board; commercial offer simplification; IT network and global
process modernization (through higher investments in IT and commercial systems as well as call
center costs reduction); and improving sales channels with a more efficient back office. All these
measures allow for the liberalization of resources that can be used for transformation, improving
network and accelerating the digitalization process.

On the other hand, various factors have contributed to the fact that Telefénica has experienced a
downward trend in some key financial performance indicators during the 2014-2016 period.

First, changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in 2015 with the depreciation of the
Brazilian real against the euro and the effects of the depreciation of the Venezuelan bolivar. In
2016 such currencies continued to depreciate and the Companu’s results were also affected by
devaluations in the United Kingdom, Argentina and Mexico, adversely and significantly affecting
revenue growth.

Second, the high inflation in certain countries affected cost growth in numerous markets where
Telefonica is present which were not offset by the increase in tariffs.

Third, after a period of significant expansion, Telefonica has generally reduced the scope of its
activities and exited certain countries in recent years to reduce its level of indebtedness and
strengthen Telefonica's capacity for future growth.

Telefonica, S.A. 190

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Fourth, Telefénica's business is highly regulated, which affects its revenues and imposes costs
on its operations. For example, regulation sets the fixed rates that Telefonica charges for calls
received from other companies’ networks, and regulators have progressively lowered these rates
in recent years.

e Fifth, in recent years Telefonica has experienced an intense competition in the markets where it
operates, resulting in more bundled offers and making it difficult to monetize value added
services.

e In the last two years, within the above mentioned simplification process, Telefonica has
redefined its processes, readapting its resource necessities, resulting in various provisions which
have affected, results in 2015 as well as in 2016.

In the 2014-2016 period these negative factors have contributed to a downward trend in some of
Telefénica’s key market indicators, such as the Profit for the year (-26.2% during the period). On the
other hand, the positive result of the strategy with a focus on sustainable and profitable growth is
reflected in the Revenue trend during the 2014-2016 period, up 3.3%.

2016 highlights

In 2016 Telefénica has taken further steps aimed at achieving profitable and sustainable long-term
growth, and improving in efficiencies and synergies, which resulted in a higher OIBDA (+14.3% year-on-
year in reported terms). Additionally, the investment levels over total revenues continued above 17%
with a total amount of 8,928 million euros, with more than 2,000 million euros dedicated to LTE and ultra
broad band (“UBB”). The Company closed the year with a total of 350 million accesses, representing a
stable growth level (0.7% versus 2015), where the downward growth trend in prepay and fixed voice was
more than compensated by the growth in value customers. Post-pay customers, which grew by 6.3%
year-on-year, reaching 111 million customers, while fiber customers amounted to 7.3 million customers
at December 2016, representing a 18.9% increase year-on-year.

In 2016, revenues totaled 52,036 million euros, down 5.2% compared to 2015 in reported terms. OIBDA
totaled 15,118 million euros in 2016, up 14.3% in reported terms. In organic terms (which term and
calculation is explained further below), OIBDA was up 4.7%, due mainly to the positive evolution of all the
regions mainly as a consequence of the integration synergies in Telefonica Brazil and Telefénica
Germany, the positive evolution of service revenues and the continuous effort in efficiency and
simplification.

Telefénica's total accesses totaled 350.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Group accesses increased by
0.7% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the solid growth in accesses in Telefonica Germany, Telefonica
United Kingdom and Telefonica Hispanoamérica. By service, it is worth highlighting the higher
commercial activity based on high value customers, resulting in a sustained growth of the contract
mobile segment (smartphones and LTE) and fiber. It is worth mentioning, the growth in accesses in
Telefonica Hispanoamérica (representing 39% of the Group's total accesses as of December 31, 2016) up

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

Year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in “organic terms” intend to
present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis, by considering a constant perimeter of
consolidation and constant exchange rates and by making certain other adjustments which are described
herein. “Organic variations” should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to reported variations.

For purposes of this report, 2016/2015 “organic” variation is defined as the reported variation as adjusted

to exclude the impacts detailed below:

e Foreign exchange effects and hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela: we have

excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average foreign
exchange rates year on year. In particular, we have used the average foreign exchange rates of
2015 for both years.

Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on our reported 2016 results, mainly due to the
depreciation versus the euro of various Latin American currencies (in particular the Argentine
peso, the Brazilian real and, to a lesser extent, the Venezuelan bolivar), and the pound sterling.

We have also excluded the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela by reversing
such adjustments.

Changes in the scope of consolidation: we have excluded the impact of changes in our
consolidation perimeter in 2016 and 2015. The main changes in our consolidation perimeter in
such years related to the consolidation of GVT in Telefonica Brazil since May 2015 and the
consolidation of DTS in Telefénica Spain since May 2015. In addition, Telefé was sold in
November 2016.

Telefonica, S.A. 198

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

In order to exclude the impact of these changes in our perimeter for the calculation of organic
variations, the 2015 comparative figures:

o include GVT’s results from January 1 to April 30, 2015;
o include DTS's results from January 1 to April 30, 2015;
o exclude Telefé’s results from November 1 to December 31, 2015.

e Restructuring costs: we have excluded the impact in 2016 and 2015 of certain restructuring
costs, mainly those related to the first Collective Agreement of Related Companies in Spain,
restructuring processes relating to Germany and Brazil and the Group's simplification program in
global areas.

The distribution by segment of the restructuring costs is as follows (impacts on OIBDA):

Million euros 2015 2016
Telefonica Spain (Individual Suspension Plan) 2,896 789
Telefonica Spain (other restructuring plans) - 48
Telefonica Brazil 7 40
Telefonica Germany 74 89
Telefonica United Kingdom 4 37
Telefonica Hispanoamérica 38 84
Other companies 198 293
Total restructuring costs 3,217 1,380

e Results of tower sales: the results attributable to the sale of towers in 2016 and 2015 have
been excluded.

In 2016, the results from the sale of towers totaled 1 million euros, mainly in Telefonica
Hispanoamérica. In 2015, the results from the sale of towers totaled 65 million euros, distributed
as follows: Telefonica Spain (38 million euros), Telefonica Brazil (10 million euros) and Telefonica
Hispanoamérica (18 million euros, mainly in Chile).

e Irrevocable commitment with Fundaci6n Telefonica: in 2015 we have excluded the expense
(325 million euros) resulting from Telefonica, S.A.'s irrevocable commitment to make a donation
to Fundaci6n Telefonica in order to provide this entity with the financing required so that it can
carry out its existing or new social programs and non-profit activities in the short and medium
term.

e Adjustment to the final purchase price of E-Plus: in 2015 we have excluded the result from
the difference between the preliminary purchase price of E-Plus (as estimated at the end of the
valuation period) and the final purchase price agreed with KPN, totaling 104 million euros (which
had a 102 million euros positive impact on OIBDA, net of costs related to the acquisition).

¢ Spectrum acquisition: we have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2016 and 2015.

In 2016, these acquisitions totaled 345 million euros, 284 million euros corresponding to
Telefonica Pert, 48 million euros corresponding to Telefonica Brasil, 7 million euros
corresponding to Telefonica Spain and 6 million euros corresponding to Telefonica Germany.

In 2015 these acquisitions totaled 1,585 million euros, 1,198 million euros corresponding to
Telefonica Germany, 49 million euros corresponding to Telefonica Spain and 338 million euros
corresponding to Telefonica Hispanoamérica (mainly Argentina and Ecuador).

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

¢ Gains or losses on the sale of companies: the gains obtained or losses incurred from the sale of
companies have not been included in organic variations.

In 2016 the 199 million euros in profit obtained from the sale of Telefé and the 29 million euros
obtained from the sale of Telecomunicaciones Personalizadas were not included. Similarly, the
loss of 16 million euros incurred in the sale of Vocem was also not included.

Moviles Mexico amounting to 124 and 91 million euros, respectively, has been excluded.

In 2015, the impairment loss on the goodwill generated by the acquisition of Telefonica Digital
Inc. amounting to 104 million euros was excluded.

e Other adjustments: we have excluded the impact of the impairment resulting from the
deterioration in certain minority participations, totaling 23 million euros in 2015. We have also
excluded the impact of the provisions recorded in Telefonica Spain to optimize the distribution
network (18 and 30 million euros in 2016 and 2015, respectively).

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Results discussion

Revenues totaled 52,036 million euros in 2016, decreasing 5.2% compared to 2015 in reported terms.
This decrease was mainly attributable to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and
hyperinflation in Venezuela (-8.0 p.p.), which was partially offset by the changes in the consolidation
perimeter, which contributed with 1.4 p.p. to the year-on-year growth. In organic terms, revenues
increased 1.3% due to the increase in service revenues offset by the decrease in handset revenues
affected by the extension of handset lifecycles.

The structure of revenues reflects TelefOnica’s business diversification, the segment with the largest
contribution to our revenues in 2016 was Telefénica Spain, representing 24.4% (+1.8 p.p. compared to
2015), followed by Telefonica Hispanoamérica, representing 24.2% despite the adverse impact of
exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela, (-2.0 p.p. compared to 2015), and Telefonica Brazil,
representing 21.3% (+1.2 p.p. compared to 2015).

Mobile business revenues totaled 32,401 million euros in 2016 (of which 28,030 million euros
corresponded to service revenues and 4,032 million euros corresponded to handset revenues) down
8.8% year-on-year in reported terms. This decrease was mainly attributable to the impact of changes in
foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-8.7 p.p.). Excluding this impact, the year-on-year
decrease was 0.1%, mainly due to the decrease of mobile revenues in Europe due to less handsets
revenues that offset the increase of mobile revenues in Telefénica Hispanoamérica and in Telefonica
Brazil as a result mainly of the increase in the customer base and data adoption.

Mobile service revenues, which is included in mobile business revenues, totaled 28,030 million euros in
2016, down 7.5% year-on-year in reported terms explained by the impact of changes in foreign exchange
rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-8.9 p.p.). Excluding this impact, mobile service revenues increased
year-on-year by 1.5% due mainly to the higher customer base and higher data consumption.

Mobile data revenues, which is included in mobile service revenues, totaled 14,663 million euros in
2016, up 2.1% in reported terms. This increase was mainly attributable to higher consumption of data by
our customers, which was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and
hyperinflation in Venezuela (-10.2 p.p.). Excluding this impact, mobile data revenues increased by 12.3%
due mainly to the increase of non-SMS data revenues (up 19.7%) and higher use of data per customer.
Mobile data revenues accounted for 52% of mobile service revenues in 2016, up 4.9 p.p. compared to
2015 in reported terms.

Fixed revenues totaled 18,187 million euros in 2016, up 1.9% year-on-year in reported terms. This
increase was mainly attributable to the full year of consolidation of GVT and DTS in 2015 (which
accounted for +4.7 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of changes
in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-6.9 p.p.). Excluding these impacts, fixed
revenues increased 3.9%. This increase was mainly due to higher broad band connection revenues and
Pay-TV revenues as a result of the commercial actions carried out by the Company in order to increase
our value proposition and the higher customer base in Pay-TV.

Other income totaled 1,763 million euros in 2016, including the profit obtained from the sale of Telefé
(199 million euros) and Telecomunicaciones Personalizadas (29 million euros). It also included income
derived from the sale of towers totaling 1 million euros.

In 2015, other income included the positive result from the E-Plus price adjustment (104 million euros),
the positive impact from the expired payment obligation (98 million euros) in Telefonica Brazil and the
spectrum swap with AT&T in Telefonica Mexico carried out in December 2015 (79 million euros). Other
income also included in 2015 income derived from the sale of real estate (78 million euros) and the sale of
towers totaling 65 million euros in Telefonica Spain.

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Total expenses, which include supply costs, personnel costs and other expenses (principally external
services and taxes) but do not include amortization and depreciation expenses, were 38,681 million euros
in 2016, down year-on-year 11.5% in reported terms. This decrease was mainly attributable to the
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-7.5 p.p.). The costs are
explained in detail below:

e¢ Supplies amounted to 15,242 million euros in 2016, down 7.9% year-on-year in reported terms
mainly as a result of the impact of foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-6.7
p.p.). In organic terms, supplies expenses decreased by 3.1% year-on-year, mainly due to lower
handset consumption associated with a longer handset lifecycle, and lower interconnection
costs.

e¢ Personnel expenses amounted to 8,098 million euros in 2016, down 21.8% in reported terms
year-on-year compared to 2015. This decrease was mainly attributable to the restructuring
provision of 1,336 million euros, principally in Telefonica Spain, accounting for 17.2 p.p. of the
year-on-year decrease. In organic terms, personnel costs increased 1.9% year-on-year due to
inflationary pressure in some Latin American countries and the internalization of services in
Telefonica Brazil, which was partially offset by the savings generated from restructuring plans in
recent years.

The average headcount was 132,120 employees in 2016, down 1.1% compared to 2015.

e¢ Other expenses amounted to 15,341 million euros in 2016, down 8.7% in reported terms. This
decrease was mainly attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in
Venezuela (-8.7 p.p.) In organic terms, other expenses remained flat year-on-year (+0.2%),
principally due to savings in commercial costs, benefitting from higher synergies in Telefonica
Spain, Telefonica Brazil and Telefonica Germany, which offset in part the negative impact of the
inflation rates in some Latin American countries resulting in higher network costs.

OIBDA was 15,118 million euros in 2016, up 14.3% in reported terms as a result of various factors that
affect comparability, mainly the lower restructuring costs in 2016 (1,380 million euros) compared to
2015 (3,217 million euros), which accounted for 13.6 p.p. of the year-on-year increase, the provision
related to the agreement between Telefonica, S.A. and Fundacion Telefonica registered in 2015 (+2.5
p.p.), the impact of the consolidation of GVT, DTS and Telefé (+1.3 p.p.) and the capital gain from the sale
of Telefé, Telecomunicaciones Personalizadas and Vocem (+1.6 p.p.). These factors more than offset the
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-8.8 p.p.), the adjustments
made to the final acquisition price of E-Plus in 2015 (-0.8 p.p.), the impairment loss on goodwill (-0,8 p.p.)
and finally the lower sale of towers (-0.5 p.p.). In organic terms, OIBDA grew 4.7% due mainly to the
positive evolution of all the regions as consequence of the positive evolution of service revenues,
integration synergies captured in Telefonica Brazil and Telefonica Germany and the continuous effort to
contain costs.

OIBDA margin stood at 29.1% in 2016, up 5 p.p. compared to 2015 in reported terms. In organic terms
OIBDA margin was 31.5% and increased 1 p.p. compared to 2015 thanks to the increase in service
revenues and higher content costs.

By segments, the main contributors to Group OIBDA were Telefonica Spain with 29.6% (+11.9 p.p.
compared to 2015 due to lower restructuring cost provision in 2016), Telefonica Brazil with 24.6% (-2.4
p.p. compared to 2015) and Telefénica Hispanoamérica with 23% (reducing its contribution by 9.9 p.p.
compared to 2015 due to the lower contribution of Argentina, Peru and Mexico).

Depreciation and amortization amounted to 9,649 million euros in 2016, down 0.6% year-on-year in
reported terms, mainly due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela
partially offset by the consolidation of GVT and DTS. The total depreciation and amortization charges

Telefonica, S.A. 203

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

arising from purchase price allocation processes amounted to 801 million euros in 2016, down 10% year-
on-year.

Operating income (Ol) in 2016 totaled 5,469 million euros, up 55.2% in reported terms compared to
2015 for the reasons set forth above. In organic terms, operating income grew 8.3% year-on-year mostly
as a result of cost savings.

The share of loss of investments accounted for by the equity method for 2016 was a loss of 5 million
euros (compared to a loss of 10 million euros in 2015).

Net financial expense amounted to 2,219 million euros in 2016, 14.9% lower than the previous year,
due to savings from the management of debt (pound sterling hedges linked to Telefonica United
Kingdom and the lower cost of debt in European currencies). On the other hand, the higher finance
income resulting from the inflation in Venezuela was mainly offset by the income from the sale of equity
investments, with the capital loss from the sale of the 1.5% stake in China Unicom (155 million euros) in
2016, and the positive impact from the divestment of the holding in Telecom Italia, S.p.A. (380 million
euros) in 2015.

Corporate income tax amounted to 846 million euros in 2016. Considering a pre-tax profit of 3,245
million euros, the effective tax rate stood at 26.1%, 9.0 p.p. higher than the 2015 effective tax rate, due
to lower tax credits recognition in 2016.

As a result of the foregoing, profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent for 2016
was 2,369 million euros (616 million euros in 2015).

Profit attributable to non-controlling interest reached 30 million euros, 105 million euros less than in
2015, mainly due to the increase in losses attributable to minority interests at Telefonica Germany,
offset by the lower profit attributable to minority interests in Telefonica Brazil.

In 2016 the commercial activity was leveraged on the differentiated assets of the Company and, in the
second half of 2015 was strengthened by the convergent offer “Movistar Fusion+” launched in July 2015.
During the first semester of 2016 the tariffs of the consumer segment, fundamentally broadband,
postpaid mobile and “Fusion” were revised and, on July 3, 2016 a new “Movistar Fusién+" portfolio was
launched, increasing the value offered to customers and tailoring it to their preferences. Basic bundles
now include content from the Spanish "La Liga", to which "UEFA Champions and Europe League” are
added in ultrafast packages; and the new “Movistar Fusién+" bundles include additional mobile lines
and Premium TV content. It is important to highlight the good evolution of the second mobile line
included in “Fusion+ Contigo” since its launching on June 1, 2016.

Churn evolution was positive in 2016, especially taking into account the elimination of “Fusién” long-term
contracts on August 1, 2015, reflecting the higher loyalty of the customers with bundles services. This
fact has resulted in a positive performance of commercial activity in 2016, broadband net adds grew by
39% year-on-year, there were more than 775 thousand new fiber accesses, and mobile contract net adds
continued growth (+0.4 million customers). In fixed telephony the net loss of accesses decreased by
35.5% year-on-year.

Telefonica Spain had 41.2 million accesses at the end of December 2016, down 1.8% year-on-year,
explained by the decrease in prepay mobile accesses and fixed telephony accesses. Retail accesses also
declined by 0.6% year-on-year.

“Movistar Fusion”, with a customer base of 4.3 million with 2.5 million additional wireless lines to the
base offer as of December 31, 2016, maintained a solid year-on-year growth (+5% and +26%
respectively compared to December 2015) and contributed 83% of the fixed retail broadband customer
base (3.0% year-on-year) and 73% of the wireless contract customer base (6 p.p. year-on-year). There

Telefonica, S.A. 205

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

was significant growth in the penetration of the high value services of “Movistar Fusi6n", with 37% of the
customer base already using 100 Mb or 300 Mb ultra-fast broadband (+8 p.p. year-on-year) and 68% of
the customer base with Pay-TV as of December 31, 2016 (+5 p.p. year-on-year).

Fixed accesses decreased 2.9% year-on-year, with a net loss of 285 thousand accesses in the year 2016.
This decrease was mainly due to a slower fixed access market evolution.

Retail broadband accesses presented 105 thousand new accesses in 2016, totaling 6.1 million acesses
(+1.8% year-on-year) due to a low churn (1.4% in 2016, +0.02 p.p. year-on-year).

Fiber accesses showed a good evolution in terms of net adds (0.8 million new accesses in 2016),
reaching 3.0 million customers in 2016 (up 34.9% compared to 2015), 49% of which corresponded to
broad band accesses (+12 p.p. year-on-year), and with more than 775 thousand new accesses in 2016.
Ultra-speed fiber accesses, with 100 or 300 Mb (with additional ARPU of 10 euros, including VAT) reached
2.0 million accesses (68% of total fiber accesses). At December 31, 2016 the fiber deployment reached
17.1 million premises, 2.7million more than at December 31, 2015, and continues to be the largest in
Europe.

Total mobile accesses stood at 17.2 million, down 0.1% compared with year-end 2015 as a result of the
decrease in prepay accesses. The contract access base accelerated its growth during 2016, growing by
2.9% year-on-year. Smartphone penetration stood at 70.9% of the mobile voice base (+4.6 p.p.
compared to year-end 2015) and significantly boosted data traffic growth to 62% year-on-year in 2016
due to the higher number of customers with the renewed portfolio containing superior data packages.

LTE network rollout continued to progress well and coverage reached (based on our estimates)
approximately 91% of the population at the end of 2016, up 16 p.p. compared to 2015, due to the
deployment of the 800 MHz. As a result, the LTE customer base reached 6.0 million customers in 2016,
almost doubling the customer base in 2015, while penetration reached 40% (+19 p.p. year-on-year).

Pay-TV accesses reached 3.7 million, in line with the previous year, including 613 thousand satellite TV
accesses from DTS.

Given the high penetration level of the convergent offer “Fusién", the revenue breakdown by service is
considered to be increasingly less relevant in 2016. For this reason, Telefonica Spain has disclosed a new
revenue breakdown that management believes is more meaningful.

The table below shows the evolution of Telefénica Spain's results over the past two years:

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Spain, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate

2016/2015 variations in organic terms:

e Changes in the scope of consolidation: DTS was included in Telefénica'’s consolidation
perimeter on May 1, 2015. In order to exclude the impact of this change in the perimeter for the
calculation or organic variations, the 2015 comparative figures include DTS's results from

January 1 to April 30, 2015.

e Restructuring costs: the impact of certain restructuring costs related to the Voluntary
Suspension Plan in Spain and amounting to 837 million and 2,896 million euros in 2016 and

2015, respectively, has been excluded.

e Results of tower sales: the result obtained by Telefonica Spain from the sale of towers in 2015
totaling 38 million euros, has been excluded. Telefonica Spain recognized no result from the sale

of towers in 2016.

e¢ Spectrum acquisition: we have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2016 and 2015,

which totaled 7 and 49 million euros, respectively.

e Gains or losses on the sale of companies: in 2016, the gain obtained from the sale of
Telecomunicaciones Personalizadas for 29 million euros was excluded.

Telefonica, S.A. 207

¢ Optimization of the distribution network: the impact of the provisions recorded for 18 million
and 30 million euros in 2016 and 2015, respectively, have been excluded.

The table below shows 2016/2015 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in

Results discussion

Revenues in Telefonica Spain in 2016 were 12,713 million euros, up 2.5% year-on-year in reported terms
mainly as a result of the consolidation of DTS since May 1, 2015 (which accounted for +2.6 p.p. of the
year-on-year increase). In organic terms, revenues were flat year-on-year, as lower handset revenues
were offset by higher service revenues.

Given the high penetration level of the convergent offer (which means the offer of more than a single
service for a single price), the revenue breakdown by service is considered to be increasingly less relevant.
For this reason, Telefonica Spain has established a new revenue breakdown that management believes is
more meaningful.

e Consumer revenues (6,536 million euros in 2016) grew by 6.6% year-on-year in reported
terms, as a result of the consolidation of DTS since May 1, 2015 (+4.8 p.p. of the year-on-year
increase). In organic terms, these revenues increased 1.8% year-on-year, mainly driven by the
growth in ARPU and in the number of customers. It is worth highlighting the strong growth in
"Fusion" revenues during 2016 (4,095 million euros, +21.6% year-on-year) which more than
offset the drop in "non-Fusi6n" revenues.

e Business revenues (3,423 million euros in 2016) decreased by 1.4% year-on-year in reported
terms, improving the year-on-year trend, mainly due to a better evolution in communications
revenues evolution and higher IT revenues. During 2016, business revenues showed a path of
stabilization, supported by the commercial offer renovation, with integrated connectivity
solutions, IT and digital services, all of them key for the digitalization of the businesses.

e Other revenues, which include wholesale, subsidiaries and other revenues (2,257 million euros
in 2016) grew by 4.8% year-on-year in reported terms, due to the growth in wholesale TV
revenues and fixed ingoing voice revenues.

Fusion ARPU was 80.4 euros in 2016, up 12.0% year-on-year in reported terms, boosted by the demand
of higher value packages and the tariff revisions, as well as the improvement in the customers’ mix

Telefonica, S.A. 208

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

stimulated by the renovation of the portfolio that took place in August, 2016 including mobile additional
lines and additional contents in the convergent offers.

OIBDA amounted to 4,467 million euros in 2016, up 91.2% year-on-year in reported terms, as a
consequence of the provisions recorded in 2015 totaling 2,896 million euros relating to restructuring cost
by the “Employment Suspension Plan” and 30 million euros relating to restructuring of the distribution
channel. The OIBDA reported in 2016 also included 837 million euros of provisions due to the Individual
Suspension Plan and other restructuring plans, and 18 million euros of provision due to the restructuring
of the distribution channel.

In organic terms OIBDA increased 1.4% year-on-year, mainly due to the higher service revenues, lower
personnel costs (down by 6.2% year-on-year in organic terms which is mainly explained by the savings
generated by the “employment suspension plan” (207 million euros) since April 2016) and lower other
expenses, which dropped 2.6% in reported terms and down 4.8% in organic terms excluding changes in
the perimeter of consolidation, principally due to lower commercial costs, which in total offset the
increase of supplies (+12.7% in reported terms, +4.4% in organic terms) impacted by higher content
costs and IT equipment purchases.

OIBDA margin was 35.1% in 2016 in reported terms and 41.6% in organic terms, up 16.3 p.p. year-on-
year in reported terms.

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

TELEFONICA UNITED KINGDOM

As explained above, the consolidated income statement for 2015 appearing in the Consolidated Financial
Statements has been amended to retroactively show the reclassification of Telefonica United Kingdom’s
results as continuous operations. Therefore, these results do not match the results published for such
period. Consequently, segmented information has been modified for 2015.

The table below shows the evolution of accesses in Telefonica United Kingdom over the past two years as

of December 31 of such years:

(2) Includes 720 thousand M2M accesses on the global platform since the first quarter 2016.

In 2016, Telefonica United Kingdom maintained market momentum, as a result of the 02 brand
recognition, the commercial proposal success and the customer loyalty. These factors have allowed the
company to keep growing in a competitive market.

The total access base grew 1.9% year-on-year and stood at 25.8 million at December 31, 2016, mainly
driven by a 1.8% increase in the mobile customer base.

The contract mobile customer base grew 9.0% year-on-year and reached 15.8 million accesses, with a
broadly stable 61.9% share over the total mobile base driven by the incorporation of 720 thousand M2M
accesses on the global platform, not accounted before. Net adds reached 444 thousand accesses due to
the solid contribution of postpay accesses. Smartphone penetration reached 68.4% of the total mobile
accesses base, up 8.0 p.p. year-on-year, driven by the continued growth of LTE customers (+36.1% year-
on-year reaching 10.4 million at December 31, 2016). LTE penetration reached 47% of the total mobile
access base.

The prepay access base decreased 8.1% year-on-year to 9.7 million at December 31, 2016.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica United Kingdom, we have made the following adjustments in order to
calculate 2016/2015 variations in organic terms:

e Exchange rate effect: we have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming
constant average foreign exchange rates year on year. In particular, we have used the average
foreign exchange rates of 2015 for both years.

e Restructuring costs: we have excluded the impact in 2016 and 2015 of restructuring costs,
amounting to 37 and 4 million euros, respectively.

The table below shows 2016/2015 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in
accordance with the adjustments referred to above) of certain income statement and other measures,

Results discussion

Total revenues were 6,861 million euros in 2016, down by 12.5% year-on-year in reported terms mainly
due to the depreciation of the pound sterling (which accounted for -11 p.p. of the year-on-year decrease).
In organic terms, revenues decreased by 1.5% year-on-year due mainly to lower handset sales, which
declined by 8.0% year-on-year.

Mobile service revenues totaled 5,121 million euros in 2016, down by 11.4% year-on-year in reported
terms due mainly to the depreciation of the pound sterling (which accounted for -11.1 p.p. of the year-on-
year decrease). Excluding this impact, mobile service revenues decreased by 0.3% due to the “Refresh”
commercial model as well as the low interconnection fares. Under the Refresh commercial model, certain
revenues related to handset are not considered as mobile service revenues, but as handset revenues.

Mobile ARPU decreased by 12.1% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to the depreciation of the
pound sterling. In organic terms, ARPU went down by 1.1% adversely affected by the “Refresh” model,
while data ARPU increased by 2.3%. In the “Refresh” model handset revenues are not considered as
mobile service revenues, but as handset revenues and ARPU does not reflect the handset revenues.

mainly of the depreciation of the sterling pound. In organic terms, OIBDA increased by 1.7% year-on-year
due to the reduction of costs offset by lower service revenues.

The OIBDA margin stood at 24.9% in 2016, with an increase of 0.3 p.p. in reported terms compared to

During 2016 Telefonica Germany maintained market momentum with the launch of a new Premium
portfolio called “O2 Free" on October 5, 2016, which underpins the company’s data monetization
strategy, offering more content at a higher price with a clear focus on retaining and developing the
premium customer base. Competitive pressure in the non-premium segment is showing some signs of
improvement. At the same time, Telefonica Germany delivered on its integration milestones, generating
additional savings in line with its synergy targets.

The total access base grew 2.0% year-on-year and stood at 49.3 million at December 31, 2016, mainly
driven by a 2.9% increase in the mobile base (which reached 44.3 million).

The contract mobile customer base grew 8% year-on-year and reached 20.5 million accesses, with a
broadly stable 46.3% share over the total mobile base. Net adds reached 1.5 million accesses due to the
solid contribution of partners (second brands). Smartphone penetration reached 59% of the total mobile
access base, up 5.2 p.p. year-on-year driven by the continued growth of LTE customers (+53% year-on-
year reaching 12.1 million at December 31, 2016) which reflects the continuous demand by customers
for high speed mobile data access. LTE penetration reached 27% of the total mobile access base.

The prepay access base remained broadly stable year-on-year (-0.8%) at 23.8 million. The prepay
segment lost 195 thousand accesses in 2016 due to the partner segment.

The retail broadband access loss trend continued to improve, with 6 thousand net additions in 2016.
VDSL registered 289 thousand net additions (+60% year-on-year) in 2016 and continued to benefit from
the continued strong demand, while the wholesale DSL customer base continued to fall due to the
planned dismantling of the legacy infrastructure.

Results discussion

Total revenues were 7,503 million euros in 2016, down 4.9% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly
to the lower service revenues and handset sales.

Mobile service revenues totaled 5,437 million euros in 2016, decreasing 1.7% year-on-year in reported
terms due mainly to the impact of termination and roaming tariffs, the increasing share of partner
segment (second brands) within the customer base and the competitive pressure. Telefonica Germany
continued to focus on data revenues, which increased by 5.3% and accounted for 55% of mobile service
revenues in 2016. Non-P2P SMS data revenues amounted to 2,300 million euros (increasing +13.1%
year-on-year) and non-P2P SMS data revenues accounted for 76.9% of the total data revenues (+5.3 p.p.
year-on-year).

Fixed revenues were 981million euros in 2016 (down 5.9% year-on-year), due to lower wholesale
revenues driven by the planned decommissioning of the legacy ULL platform.

Mobile ARPU was 10.3 euros in 2015 (down 3.7% year-on-year), while contract ARPU stood at 16.5
euros (down 4.1% year-on-year), as a result of the high pricing pressure in a competitive market, higher
share of wholesale customers in the customer base and the consequent change in the weight of retail to
wholesale. Data ARPU was 5.7 euros (+3.4% year-on-year).

and the lower restructuring costs recorded in 2016 (-0.8 p.p.). In organic terms, OIBDA grew by 2.9%
year-on-year, driven by the synergies captured in integration (approximately 150 million euros in 2016)
mainly by employees restructuring and infrastructure dismantling.

The OIBDA margin stood at 23.9% in reported terms for 2016, up 0.4 p.p. compared to 2015 (+1.9 p.p. in

Telefonica Brazil closed the year 2016 improving its competitive position in the mobile as well as in the
fixed market. In the mobile business, leadership has been maintained in the higher value segments, which
permitted the operator to capture mobile market revenue growth in 2016. In the fixed business, the
transformation towards fiber and Pay-TV was strengthened after the integration of GVT in May 2015.

Revenues and OIBDA evolution was positively supported by the acceleration of mobile data and the good
evolution of fiber and Pay-TV. Additionally, Telefonica Brazil carried out costs control measures and
generated benefits from the synergies with GVT that offset the adverse macroeconomic situation in
Brazil.

However, results in 2016 were adversely affected by the interconnection tariff reduction in the mobile
business (-33.8%) and in the retail fixed-mobile tariff (-20.6%), fixed-local (-65.9%) and fixed-interurban
(-21.3%) since February 25, 2016.

Telefonica Brazil reached 97.2 million accesses at December 31, 2016, up 0.3% compared with
December 2015.

In the mobile business, the strategic focus remained on gaining and retaining high value customers,
reaching a market share of 42.1% in the contract segment as of December 31, 2016 (Source: Anatel),
preserving the leadership. Telefonica Brazil maintained its market leadership in terms of total accesses
with a market share of 30.2% as of December 2016 (source: Anatel), driven by the contract clients
growth (7.5% year-on-year), and offset the fall in prepaid clients (-4.3% year-on-year). An improvement
has been experienced on the “familiar plans”, giving the chance to proceed to data sharing among the

same family, as well as progress in online client assistance through “meu vivo", acclaiming one of Vivo's
strengths and continuing with constant upgrades.

In its fixed business, Telefonica Brazil maintained its strategic focus on fiber deployment, with 17 million
premises passed with fiber at December 31, 2016 and 4.3 million homes connected. Traditional accesses
decreased 2.2% due to the fixed-mobile substitution. Retail broadband accesses totaled 7.3 million
accesses at the end of 2016, increasing 2.5% year-on-year. Among them, 59% accesses were connected
with FTCC. Pay TV customers reached 1.7 million as of December 31, 2016, down 4.2% in reported terms
due mainly to the macroeconomic situation and a commercial strategy based in value clients gaining.
IPTV accesses increased in relevance representing 13% of total Pay TV accesses.

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Brazil, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate
2016/2015 variations in organic terms:

e Exchange rate effect: we have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming
constant average foreign exchange rates year on year. In particular, we have used the average
foreign exchange rates of 2015 for both years.

e Changes in the scope of consolidation: GVT was included in Telefénica's consolidation
perimeter in May 2015. In order to exclude the impact of this change in the perimeter for the
calculation of organic variations, the 2015 comparative figures include GVT's results from
January 1 to April 30, 2015.

e Restructuring costs: we have excluded the impact of restructuring costs associated with the
simplification processes implemented in Telefonica Brazil. In 2016, these restructuring costs
totaled 40 million euros. In 2015, these restructuring costs totaled 7 million euros

Results discussion

Revenues totaled 11,097 million euros in 2016, up 0.3% in reported terms and 0.9% year-on-year in
organic terms, due mainly to the depreciation of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -5.2 p.p. of the
evolution) and the consolidation of GVT (+4.6 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year variation of 0.9%
was principally due to the good evolution in the mobile business (+1.7% year-on-year), which was
partially offset by the impact of the regulatory interconnection tariff reduction, impacting resulting in a
reduction in fixed revenues, that decreased by 0.2%.

e Revenues from the mobile business totaled 6,669 million euros in 2016, down 3.4% in
reported terms due mainly to the depreciation of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -5.0 p.p.
of the evolution). In organic terms, revenues from the mobile business increased by 1.7% due to
the positive evolution of service revenues (+3.1% year-on-year) as a result of the good
performance of outbound revenues, which in turn increased as a result of an increase in the
customer base and the increased proportion of data revenues. This offsets the decrease in
inbound revenues because of the fall in interconnection, due to the decrease of tariffs, and
prepaid revenues associated with the customer base fall. Additionally, handsets’ revenues slow
down 23.9% in reported terms due to a lower commercial activity.

e Fixed telephony revenues totaled 4,428 million euros, up by 6.6% in reported terms due
mainly to the impact of the consolidation of GVT (+12.3 p.p.) and partially offset by depreciation
of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -5.6 p.p. of the evolution). In organic terms, revenues
were down by 0.2%, mainly due to the regulatory impact of the decrease of the fixed-mobile and
fixed-fixed tariffs that compensate the increase in broadband and new services revenues, which
were up by 6.5% year-on-year in organic terms supported by the increase in fiber and Pay TV
revenues.

The mobile ARPU increased 13.3% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to the better quality of
the customer base and the expansion of data revenues that compensate the depreciation of the Brazilian
real. In organic terms, it increased 19.3% year-on-year as a consequence of the higher data ARPU which
more than offset the negative impact of the reduction in the mobile termination rates. We believe the
high quality of the client base is reflected in an increase in the outbound ARPU and the 25.3% growth in
the data ARPU.

OIBDA stood at 3,714 million euros in 2016, up 3.9% in reported terms. This evolution was affected by
the recognition of a 40 million euros related to a restructuring personnel plan in 2016 compared with the
7 million euros provision registered in 2015, the positive impact from the expired payment obligation (98
million euros) in 2015, the negative impact of the depreciation of the Brazilian real (-5.4 p.p.) and the
consolidation of GVT (+5.1 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year increase was 5.3% due to revenue
improvement and cost efficiency compensating a worse macro scenario with higher inflation, more
devaluation and greater insolvencies provision rates. Personnel expenses totaled 1,167 million euros in
2016, up 11.9% in reported terms as result mainly of the consolidation of GVT, which was partially offset
by the depreciation of the Brazilian real. In organic terms, personnel expenses increased by 3.1% year-on-
year due to higher social benefits and the internalization of network contractors that compensates
benefits from restructuring plans and voluntary redundancy programs in 2016. In addition, supplies costs
fell (-10.9% in organic terms) thanks to the positive impact of the interconnection tariff reduction and
lesser devices consumption (commercial activity focused on profitable clients).

The OIBDA margin stood at 33.5% in reported terms for 2016, up 1.2 p.p. compared to 2015.

Notes:

(1) Includes "fixed wireless" and Voice over IP accesses.

Total accesses reached 135.9 million at December 31, 2016 (+0.9% year-on-year).

Mobile accesses totaled 115.3 million customers and grew 1.7% year-on-year, highlighting the higher
quality of the customer base.

e In the contract segment, accesses grew 3.4% year-on-year. Growth was particulary strong in
Argentina (+3.3%), Chile (+7.5%) and Colombia (+6.0%). Annual net adds reached 854 thousand
customers, mainly due to the contribution of Argentina (+231 thousand accesses), Chile (+218
thousand accesses) and Colombia (+203 thousand accesses), benefitting from a successful
strategy of migrations (from prepay to contract), as well as a higher amount of gross adds.

e In the prepay segment, accesses grew 1.3% year-on-year, with net adds of 1,1 million
customers. Growth was driven mainly by Mexico (+1.5 million accesses), Colombia (+0.6 million
accesses) and Central America (+0.8 million accesses), compensating the negative net adds in
other markets like Peru (-1.2 million accesses) and Chile (-1.0 million accesses). Such increases
were explained by strong price competitition in the prepay segment, not followed by Movistar to
avoid harming the quality levels of the network (avoiding reduced price offers), along with the
focus on attracting high value customers that allowed the acceleration of migration processes
from prepay to contract.

e The smartphone customer base grew 14.7% year-on-year to 46.1 million accesses, with a
penetration over mobile accesses of 41.3% (+4.7 p.p. year-on-year), mainly due to the growth in
all countries of the region. At the same time, 4G accesses continued growing, reaching 15.5
million accesses at the end of the year.

Traditional fixed business accesses stood at 11.9 million at December 31, 2016 (-6.9% year-on-year)
with negative net adds of 0.9 million customers, affected by the erosion of traditional fixed business in
the region, including Argentina (-4.0% year-on-year), Peru (-5.8% year-on-year), Chile (-5.4% year-on-
year) and Colombia (-5.4% year-on-year).

Broadband accesses totaled 5.6 million at December 31, 2016 (-0.7% year-on-year), due to negative net
adds in Colombia (-3.6%) and Argentina (-1.6%), which were not enough to offset the positive

performance of Peru (+2.4%). The penetration of fixed broadband accesses over traditional fixed
business accesses was 46.7% at December 31, 2016 (+2.9 p.p. year-on-year). There was progressive
migration towards data plans with higher speeds, with 62.1% of broadband accesses having a speed over
4Mb at December 31, 2016 (+9 p.p. year-on-year).

TV accesses totaled 2.9 million (+3.8% year-on-year), with net adds of 107 thousand customers as a
result of an improvement in all the countries in the region that offer the service. Growth was particularly
positive in Peru (+6.2%), Colombia (+5.9%) and Chile (+2.5%).

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Hispanoamérica, we have made the following adjustments in order to
calculate 2016/2015 variations in organic terms:

e Exchange rate effects and hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela: we have excluded
the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average foreign exchange rates
year on year. In particular, we have used the average foreign exchange rates of 2015 for both
years. We have also excluded the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela by
reversing such adjustments.

e Restructuring costs: we have excluded the impact of restructuring costs in 2016 and 2015,
amounting to 84 and 38 million euros, respectively.

e Results of tower sales: the results attributable to the sale of towers have been excluded (1
million euros in 2016 and 18 million euros in 2015).

e Spectrum acquisition: the impact of spectrum acquisitions has been excluded in 2016 (284
million euros, corresponding to Peru) and 2015 (338 million euros, mainly corresponding to
Argentina and Ecuador).

Telefonica, S.A. 221

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Capital gains and losses on sales of companies: gains and losses obtained from the sale of
companies are excluded to calculate organic variations. In 2016, the profit from the sale of Telefé
for 15 million euros was excluded.

Goodwill impairments: Impairment losses from goodwill in consolidation are excluded to
calculate organic variations. In 2016, the impairment loss on the goodwill assigned to Telefonica
Venezolana and Telefonica Méviles Mexico amounting to 124 and 91 million euros, respectively.

The table below shows 2016/2015 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in

Results discussion

Revenues amounted to 12,579 million euros in 2016, decreasing 12.6% year-on-year in reported terms
due to the foreign exchange effects and the hyperinflation in Venezuela (-20.0 p.p.). Revenues increased
7.5% year-on-year in organic terms mainly due to the growth in data revenues (mobile and fixed) and the
growth of the customer base, higher data usage per customer and higher data penetration.

Mobile service revenues reached 7,918 million euros in 2016 and decreased by 13.6% year-on-
year in reported terms. This decrease was mainly driven by the foreign exchange effects and the
hyperinflation in Venezuela (which decreased growth by 20.6 p.p. of the year-on-year variation).
Excluding these effects, these revenues grew by 7.0% principally as a result of the increase of
service revenues in Argentina (18.4%). Mobile service revenues performance by country was as
follows:

o In Argentina: mobile service revenues amounted to 1,628 million euros in 2016,
decreasing 25.8% year-on-year in reported terms. This decrease was mainly due to the
exchange rate effect, reducing growth by 44.2 p.p. Excluding this effect, revenues
increased by 18.4% due to the data revenues growth leveraged on the higher 4G
customer base, permitting data consumption acceleration and commercial offers
adapted to the inflationary environment.

o In Mexico: mobile service revenues reached 1,246 million euros in 2016, decreasing 19%
year-on-year in reported terms. In local currency, these revenues decreased 4.9%,
mainly due to lower prepaid revenues as a result of strong competition and due to the

Telefonica, S.A. 222


--- Page 36 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

regulatory impact, which was partially offset by a satisfactory performance in wholesale
service.

o InChile: service revenues reached 1,103 million euros in 2016, decreasing 6.3% year-on-
year in reported terms mainly due to the foreign exchange effect (-3.1 p.p.). In local
currency, these revenues decreased by 3.2% affected by lower prepaid revenues as well
as lower interconnection rates.

o In Peru: mobile service revenues reached 1,206 million euros in 2016, decreasing 13.2%
year-on-year in reported terms mainly due to the foreign exchange effect (-5 p.p.). In
local currency these revenues decreased by 8.2%, affected by the reduction of prepaid
and contract revenues due to higher aggressiveness in the market, resulting in lower
ARPUs.

e Data revenues in the segment reached 3,511 million euros in 2016 and decreased 4.8% year-
on-year in reported terms mainly due to foreign exchange effects and the hyperinflation in
Venezuela (-24.4 p.p). Excluding these effects, these revenues grew 19.6% year-on-year mainly
due to the increase in data revenues in most of the countries of the region and by the higher data
penetration which grew from 41.3% in 2015 to 46.1% during 2016.

e Fixed business revenues reached 3,732 million euros in 2016, and decreased 8.3% in reported
terms. Excluding the foreign exchange effects and the hyperinflation in Venezuela (which
decreased growth by 20.5p.p.) these revenues grew by 12.2% due to the increase in broadband
and new services revenues (+21.6%). Revenues from broadband and new services, accounted for
53.7% of fixed revenues (+3.0 p.p. year-on-year). The growth was particularly notable in
Argentina (44.7%), Colombia (17.4%) and Chile (11.7%) with a strong growth in broadband
revenues due to the higher quality of the customer base as well as the tariff adjustment.

OIBDA reached 3,477 million euros in 2016, decreasing 20.2% in reported terms, negatively affected by
the goodwill impairment in Mexico and Venezuela and restructuring costs in 2016 and 2015 previously
mentioned, and offset by the generated capital gain from the Telefé sale. Excluding these adjustments,
exchange rate effects and hyperinflation in Venezuela, OIBDA increased 3.9% in organic terms. This
growth is mainly due to the good evolution in revenues and higher commercial efficiencies that offset
higher interconnection, content and network costs, up principally due to the devaluation in certain
countries in the region. Energy, electricity and call center costs also increased during 2016.

Below additional information by country.

o Argentina: OIBDA reached 797 million euros in December 2016, decreasing 20.7% in
reported terms. In local currency, OIBDA increased by 26.6%, mainly due to the revenue
growth as well as to lower commercial costs recorded in 2016, as a result of lower
commercial activity and greater commercial efficiency.

o Chile: OIBDA reached 704 million euros in December 2016, decreasing 7.4% in reported
terms mainly due to the exchange rate evolution (-3 p.p.). In local currency, OIBDA
decreased by 4.4%, explained by the decrease in mobile service revenues.

co Peru: OIBDA reached 782 million euros in December 2016, decreasing 17.1% in reported
terms mainly due to the exchange rate evolution. In local currency, OIBDA decreased by
12.3%, as the efforts in costs savings were insufficient to compensate higher
interconnection costs associated with higher traffic, and more than offset the revenue
increase.

o Colombia: OIBDA reached 464 million euros in December 2016, decreasing 15% in reported
terms mainly due to the exchange rate evolution. In local currency, OIBDA decreases 5.1%

year-on-year due to higher interconnection costs associated to the successful offer “Todo
Destino”.

The OIBDA margin was 27.6% in 2016, decreasing 2.6 p.p. in reported terms. This decrease is affected
by the margin reduction in Chile (-1.7 p.p.), Peru (-2.8 p.p.), Colombia (-3.3 p.p.) and Mexico (-5.0 p.p.),
reflecting a higher commercial effort focused on higher value segments.

2015/2014 Consolidated results

In this section, we discuss changes in the Group's consolidated income statements for 2015 and 2014.
The consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 set forth
below has been retrospectively amended, in order to cease to present our operations in the United
Kingdom as a discontinued operation.

As explained above, the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2015 has been
amended to retroactively show the reclassification of Telefonica United Kingdom’s results as continuing
operations. Therefore, the results below differ from the results previously published for such period. The
segmented financial information shown below has been amended for 2015 as discussed above.

Telefénica's total accesses totaled 347.5 million as of December 31, 2015. Telefonica United Kingdom
customers have been included in the 2014 and 2015 customer base, since we have classified Telefonica
United Kingdom and its operations as continuing operations. Group accesses increased 1.9% year-on-
year, as a result mainly of the additional accesses gained following the purchase of GVT by Telefonica
Brazil and DTS in Telefonica Spain and the growth in accesses in Telefonica Hispanoamérica, Telefonica
Germany and Telefénica United Kingdom. If we consider the accesses from GVT and DTS as of December
31, 2014 to make both years comparable, accesses would have decreased by 0.8% affected, in part, by
prepaid disconnections in Telefonica Brazil (which resulted in the disconnection of 11.5 million accesses
in 2015 and 1.6 million accesses in 2014). In 2015, commercial activity increased based on high value
customers, resulting in growth of the contract mobile segment (smartphones and LTE), fiber and Pay TV.
Accesses in Telefonica Hispanoamérica (38.7% of the Group's total as of December 31, 2015) increased
by 2.3% year-on-year, Telefonica United Kingdom (7.3% of the Group's total as of December 31, 2015)
increased by 2.3% year-on-year, while accesses in Telefonica Germany (13.9% of the Group's total)
increased by 1.5% year-on-year.

The Group's strategy is based on capturing growth in its markets, especially on attracting high-value
customers.

Mobile accesses totaled 272.1 million at December 31, 2015, down 0.9% compared to December 31,
2014, affected mainly by the decrease in prepay accesses (due to the disconnection of prepay accesses
in Brazil (11.5 million accesses in 2015 and 1.6 million accesses in 2014)). Contract accesses, however,
were up 5.6% year-on-year, continuing to increase their weight over total mobile accesses up to 38.3%
(+2.3 p.p. year-on-year).

Smartphone accesses maintained a strong growth rate (up 48.3% year-on-year), totaling 126.2 million
accesses as of December 31, 2015 and reaching a penetration rate over total accesses of 49.5% (+14.3
p.p. year-on-year), reflecting the Company's strategic focus on the growth of its data services.

Fixed broadband accesses stood at 21.0 million at December 31, 2015, up 18.7% year-on-year (of
which 16.6 p.p. was due to the inclusion of accesses from GVT in the 2015). Fiber accesses stood at 6.1
million at December 31, 2015.

TV accesses totaled 8.3 million up 63% year-on-year (of which 28 p.p. was due to the inclusion of
accesses from DTS and 17 p.p. was due to the inclusion of accesses from GVT in the 2015 access base).

Telefénica'’s customer base includes the consumer and business segments, and therefore is not affected
by customer concentration risk.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As previously mentioned, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in

“organic

terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis (see Consolidated

Results 2016/2015- Adjustments for the calculation of organic variations)

The adju:

stments made to calculate 2015/2014 organic variations are the following:

Foreign exchange effects and the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela:
We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average
foreign exchange rates in 2015 and 2014. In particular, we have used the average foreign
exchange rates of 2014 for both years.

Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on our reported 2015 results, mainly due to the
depreciation of various Latin American currencies versus the euro, in particular the Brazilian real
and, to a lesser extent, the Venezuelan bolivar.

We have also excluded the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela by reversing
such adjustments.

Changes in the scope of consolidation: We have excluded the impact of changes in our
consolidation perimeter in 2015 and 2014. The main changes in our consolidation perimeter in
such years related to the consolidation of GVT in Telefonica Brazil since May 2015, the
consolidation of DTS in Telefénica Spain since May 2015, the consolidation of E-Plus in
Telefonica Germany since October 2014 and the sale of Telefonica Ireland in July 2014.

In order to exclude the impact of these changes in our perimeter, we have:
o consolidated GVT's results from May 1 to December 31, 2014 in our 2014 results;
o consolidated DTS's results from May 1 to December 31, 2014 in our 2014 results;

o consolidated E-Plus’s results from January 1 to September 30, 2014 in our 2014 results; and

Telefonica, S.A. 227

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

o excluded Telefonica Ireland's results from January 1 to June 30, 2014 from our 2014 results.

e Restructuring costs: We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs, mainly those
related to the 1st Collective Agreement of Related Companies in Telefonica Spain, restructuring
processes relating to Telefonica Germany, Telefonica United Kingdom and Telefonica Brazil and
the Group's simplification program.

In 2015, these restructuring costs totaled 3,217 million euros and were aimed at increasing
future efficiency, representing a further step towards the transformation and simplification
initiatives carried out by Telefonica. These costs were distributed by segment as follows
(impacts on OIBDA): Telefénica Spain (2,896 million euros), Telefonica Germany (74 million
euros), Telefonica Hispanoamérica (38 million euros), Telefonica Brazil (7 million euros),
Telefonica United Kingdom (4 million euros) and other companies (197 million euros).

In 2014, these restructuring costs totaled 658 million euros and were attributable to the
simplification initiatives that the Group has implemented to meet its targets. These costs were
mainly distributed by segment as follows (impacts on OIBDA): Telefonica Germany (414 million
euros), Telefonica Brazil (68 million euros), Telefonica Hispanoamérica (99 million euros, mainly
in Peru) and other companies (77 million euros).

e Results of tower sales: The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2015 and 2014 have
been excluded in both years.

In 2015 the results from the sale of towers totaled 65 million euros, distributed as follows:
Telefonica Spain (38 million euros), Telefonica Brazil (10 million euros) and Telefénica
Hispanoamérica (18 million euros, mainly in Chile). In 2014 the results from the sale of towers
totaled 196 million euros in OIBDA, mainly in Telefonica Spain (191 million euros).

e Irrevocable commitment with Fundaci6n Telefonica: In 2015 we have excluded the expense
(325 million euros) resulting from Telefonica, S.A.'s irrevocable commitment to make a donation
to Fundaci6n Telefonica in order to provide this entity with the financing required so that it can
carry out its existing or new social programs and non-profit activities in the short and medium
term.

e Adjustments to the final purchase price of E-Plus: In 2015 we have excluded the positive
result from the difference between the preliminary purchase price of E-Plus (as estimated at the
end of the valuation period) and the final purchase price agreed with KPN, totaling 104 million
euros (which had a 102 million euros positive impact on OIBDA, net of costs related to the
acquisition).

e¢ Spectrum acquisition: We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2015 and
2014.

In 2015, these acquisitions totaled 1,585 million euros, 1,198 million euros corresponding to
Telefonica Germany, 49 million euros corresponding to Telefonica Spain and 338 million euros
corresponding to Telefonica Hispanoamérica (mainly Argentina and Ecuador).

In 2014 these acquisitions totaled 1,294 million euros, 889 million euros corresponding to
Telefonica Brazil and 405 million euros corresponding to Telefonica Hispanoamérica with the
following distribution by country or region:

o Telefénica Argentina (168 million euros);
o Telefénica Colombia (111 million euros); and

o Telefénica Venezuela and Central America (126 million euros).

Telefonica, S.A. 228

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Real Estate Efficiency Plan: In 2014 we have excluded the impact of certain urban assets
qualification changes in Telefonica Spain and also the investment in Telefonica's Barcelona head
office, which had an impact on capital expenditures (Capex) of 78 million euros.

¢ Other adjustments: We have excluded the partial adjustment of the goodwill generated in the
acquisition of Telefonica Digitial Inc. amounting to 104 million euros y the impact of the
impairment resulting from the deterioration in certain minority participations, totaling 23 million
euros in 2015. We have also excluded the impact of the 30 million euros provision recorded in
2015 in Telefonica Spain to optimize the distribution channel.

Results Discussion

Revenues totaled 54,916 million euros in 2015, increasing 9.0% compared to 2014 in reported terms.
This increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted for
7.6 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign
exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-2.3 p.p.). In organic terms, revenues increased 3.5% due
to higher connectivity revenues, mainly in the mobile business as a consequence of the strong data
revenue growth. The growing focus on our key markets was reflected in the revenue mix with Telefonica
Spain, Telefonica Brazil and Telefonica Germany accounting for 57.1% of the revenues, increasing local
scale and keeping at the same time the Group's differential diversification and global scale.

The structure of revenues reflects Telefonica's business diversification. Despite the adverse impact of
exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela, the segment with the largest contribution to our
revenues in 2015 was Telefonica Hispanoamérica, representing 26.2% (+0.1 p.p. compared to 2014),
followed by Telefonica Spain, representing 22.6% (-1.3 p.p. compared to 2014), Telefonica Brazil,
representing 20.1% (-2.2 p.p. compared to 2014), Telefonica Germany, which increased its contribution
with respect to 2014 to 14.4% (+3.4 p.p. year-on-year), and Telefonica United Kingdom representing
14.3% (+0.3 p.p. compared to 2014).

Mobile business revenues totaled 35,540 million euros in 2015 (of which 30,289 million euros
corresponded to service revenues and 4,984 million euros corresponded to handset revenues) up 8.2%
year-on-year in reported terms. This increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus
(which accounted for 6.1 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of
changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-1.6 p.p.). Excluding these impacts,
year-on-year growth was 3.5% due to higher mobile revenues in Telefonica Hispanoamérica and
Telefonica Brazil as a result mainly of the increase in the customer base and data adoption.

Mobile service revenues totaled 30,289 million euros in 2015, up 6.6% year-on-year in reported terms.
This increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus (which accounted for 6.0 p.p. of the
year-on-year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and
hyperinflation in Venezuela (-2.2 p.p.). Excluding these impacts, year-on-year growth was 2.6% due
mainly to the higher customer base and higher data consumption.

Telefonica, S.A. 230

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Mobile data revenues totaled 13,869 million euros in 2015, up 18.9% in reported terms. This increase
was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus (which accounted for 7.9 p.p. of the year-on-year
increase) and the higher consumption of data of our customers, which was partially offset by the impact
of changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-2.2 p.p.). Excluding these impacts,
mobile data revenues increased by 12.2% due mainly to the increased revenues of non-SMS data (up
20.4%) and higher use of data per customer. Mobile data revenues accounted for 45.5% of mobile service
revenues in 2015, up 4.8 p.p. compared to 2014 in reported terms.

Fixed revenues totaled 17,854 million euros in 2015, up 9.5% year-on-year in reported terms. This
increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of GVT and DTS (which accounted for +10.9 p.p. of
the year-on-year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates
and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-3.9 p.p.). Excluding these impacts, fixed revenues increased 2.2%. This
increase was mainly due to higher broad band connection revenues and Pay-TV revenues as a result of
the commercial actions carried out by the Company in order to increase our value proposition and the
higher customer base in Pay-TV.

Other income in 2015 mainly included own work capitalized in our fixed assets, profit from the sale of
other assets, and the sale of towers by Telefénica Spain, Telefénica Brazil and Telefonica
Hispanoamérica.

In 2015, other income totaled 2,011 million euros, up 17.8% year-on-year in reported terms. In 2015,
other income was positively affected by the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS, the positive result
from the E-Plus price adjustment (104 million euros), the positive impact from the expired payment
obligation (98 million euros) in Telefonica Brazil, the spectrum swap with AT&T in Telefonica Mexico
carried out in December 2015 (79 million euros), the sale of real estate in Telefonica Spain (78 million
euros) and the result from the sale of towers amounting to 65 million euros.

In 2014, the sale of towers had a positive impact of 196 million euros. Other income also included an
extraordinary sale of real estate in Telefonica Spain (63 million euros).

Total expenses (which include supply costs, personnel costs and other expenses (principally external
services and taxes) but do not include amortization and depreciation expenses), were 43,698 million
euros in 2015, up year-on-year 19.5% in reported terms. This increase was mainly attributable to the
consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted for 8.7 p.p. of the year-on-year increase) and
higher restructuring costs amounting to 3,217 million euros (which accounted for 7.0 p.p. of the year-on-
year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and
hyperinflation in Venezuela (-1.9 p.p.). The costs are explained in detail below:

e Supplies amounted to 16,547 million euros in 2015, up 9.0% year-on-year in reported terms
mainly as a result of the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted for 8.4 p.p. of
the year-on-year increase). In organic terms, supplies expenses grew by 0.3% year-on-year, due
to increased commercial activity in high-end devices and higher TV content costs, which more
than offset the decrease in mobile interconnection costs.

e Personnel expenses amounted to 10,349 million euros in 2015, up 45.8% in reported terms
year-on-year compared to 2014. This increase was mainly attributable to higher restructuring
costs of 3,146 million euros (which accounted for +36.3 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), the
consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted for 7.1 p.p. of the year-on-year increase),
and was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in
Venezuela (-1.5 p.p.). In organic terms, personnel costs increased 4.0% year-on-year mainly
affected by inflationary pressures in some Latin American countries.

The average headcount was 133,569 employees in 2015, up 10.8% compared to 2014 (-2.1%
excluding the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation).

Telefonica, S.A. 231

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Other expenses amounted to 16,802 million euros in 2015, up 17.6% in reported terms. This
increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted
for 9.9 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), the provision of 325 million euros related to the
irrevocable agreement between Telefonica, S.A. and Fundaci6n Telefonica for its short-and mid-
term financing (+2.3 p.p.) and to a lesser extent, the impairment resulting from the deterioration
in certain minority participations, the goodwill value adjustment in Telefonica Digital Inc. (+1.1
p.p.) and the decrease in other expenses related to restructuring processes (-0.1 p.p.), which was
partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in
Venezuela (-4.4 p.p.). In organic terms, other expenses increased by 8.1% compared to 2014,
mainly as a result of increased network costs, higher IT costs and a higher commercial activity.
Increased inflation in some Latin American countries offset in part the savings resulting from the
simplification measures carried out by the Company.

OIBDA was 13,229 million euros in 2015, down 14.7% in reported terms. This decrease was mainly
attributable to the higher restructuring costs (which accounted for 16.5 p.p. of the year-on-year decrease
and included a restructuring costs provision of 3,217 million euros), the impact of changes in foreign
exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-3.2 p.p.), the provision of 325 million euros related to
the agreement between Telefonica S.A. and Fundacion Telefonica for its short and mid-term financing (-
2.1 p.p.) and, to a lesser extent, the decreased results from the sale of towers (-0.8 p.p.), the provision
recorded in connection with the optimization of the distribution channel in Spain of 30 million euros (-0.2
p.p.) and the impairment resulting from the deterioration in certain minority participations (-0.8 p.p.),
which was partially offset by the impact of the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (+4.8 p.p.) and the
adjustments made to the final acquisition price of E-Plus (+0.7 p.p.).

In organic terms, OIBDA grew 3.2% due to the positive evolution of Telefonica Germany (+20.9% year-
on-year), reflecting increased synergies, the better performance of Telefonica Brazil (+2.9% year-on-
year) and the results from Telefonica Hispanoamérica (+7.2% year-on-year).

OIBDA margin stood at 24.1% in 2015, down 6.7 p.p. compared to 2014 in reported terms due mainly to
the restructuring costs provision of 3,217 million euros in 2015.

By segments, Telefonica Hispanoamérica was the main contributor to Group OIBDA with 32.9% (+6.7 p.p.
compared to 2014), Telefonica Brazil contributed 27.0% (+4.2 p.p. compared to 2014), Telefonica
Germany contributed 14.0% (+9.3 p.p. compared to 2014) and Telefonica United kingdom contributed
14.6% (+3.3 p.p. compared to 2014). Telefonica Spain contributed 17.7% to Group OIBDA, down 18.9 p.p.
compared to 2014, mainly as a result of the restructuring cost provision of 2,896 million euros in 2015.

Depreciation and amortization amounted to 9,704 million euros in 2015, up 13.5% year-on-year in
reported terms, mainly due to the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS. The total depreciation and
amortization charges arising from purchase price allocation processes amounted to 894 million euros in
2015, up 26.3% year-on-year.

Operating income (Ol) in 2015 totaled 3,525 million euros, down 49.4% compared to 2014 for the
reasons set forth above for OIBDA. In organic terms, operating income grew 4.0% year-on-year as a result
of higher revenues and costs savings.

The share of loss of investments accounted for by the equity method for 2015 was a loss of 10
million euros (compared to a loss of 510 million euros in 2014). The loss recorded in 2014 was mainly due
to the valuation adjustment of Telco, S.p.A. at Telecom Italia, S.p.A. amounting to 464 million euros.

Net financial expense amounted to 2,609 million euros in 2015, 7.5% lower than the previous year.
Excluding exchange rate differences, costs improved by 21.2% (536 million euros) to 1,993 million euros.
Negative foreign exchange differences amounted to 616 million euros (excluding monetary correction),
primarily due to adoption of the SIMADI exchange rate for the Venezuelan bolivar. The lower cost of debt
in euros explains 146 million euros of this improvement, due to lower fixed rate debt and capture of the

Telefonica, S.A. 232

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

reduction in short-term rates. The divestment of the entire holding in Telecom Italia, S.p.A. generated a
positive variation of 404 million euros. Other effects resulted in losses of 13 million euros. These included
the monetary correction for inflation in Venezuela, net of higher expenses in Latin America currencies,
costs for updating contingencies, and other gains and losses on equities. The effective cost of debt over
2015, excluding exchange rate differences and the positive impact of the divestment of Telecom Italia,
S.p.A., stood at 4.82%, down 52 basis points year-on-year.

Corporate income tax totaled 155 million euros in 2015, compared to 383 million euros in 2014, mainly
due to the temporary difference recorded related to a restructuring provision the activation of tax credit
in Spain. Considering a pre-tax income of 906 million euros, the effective tax rate was 17.1% in 2015, 6.5
p.p. higher than in 2014.

Profit attributable to non-controlling interest reduced the profit for the year attributable to equity
holder of the parent by 135 million euros, 116 million euros less than in 2014, mainly due to the lower
profit attributable to minority interests in Telefonica Brazil and Colombia Telecomunicaciones.

As a result of the foregoing, profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent for 2015
was 616 million euros, down by 79.5% year on year compared to 2014.

In 2015 the commercial activity was leveraged on the differentiated assets of the Company and, in the
second half of 2015 was strengthened by the convergent offer “Movistar Fusion+" launched in July 2015
as well as the promotion that included all “TV Premium Extra” content from 9.90 euros/month, launched
in August 2015. This promotion was subscribed by almost 700 thousand customers, reflecting the
attractiveness of the offer (new TV contents and ultra-speed fiber in an economic environment where
private consumption continues to improve).

Telefonica, S.A. 234

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Churn evolution has been positive in 2015, especially taking into account the elimination of “Fusion” long-
term contracts on August 1, 2015. This fact, together with the good evolution in adds since the launching
of “Movistar Fusién+” has resulted in a positive performance of commercial activity. In 2015, broadband
net adds duplicated year-on-year, fiber net adds grew by 25.3%, mobile contract net adds resumed
growth (+0.2 million customers) and in fixed telephony the net loss of accesses decreased by 31.1%
year-on-year.

The results of Telefonica Spain in 2015 showed a lower decrease in revenues compared to the year-on-
year results of 2014-2013, as a result of the transformation strategy implemented in recent years which
relies on a high value offer based on the differentiated assets of Telefonica Spain, a more rational market
in competition terms and a more favorable macroeconomic context, with improvement in private
consumption.

Telefonica Spain had 42.0 million accesses at the end of December 2015, up 1.9% year-on-year, after the
consolidation of the DTS satellite TV accesses (0.9 million accesses at December 2015). The organic
variation was down by 1.6%, explained by the decrease in mobile accesses and fixed telephony accesses,
although it is important to highlight that retail accesses grew by 3.1% year-on-year.

“Movistar Fusi6n”, with a customer base of 4.2 million with 1.5 million additional wireless lines to the base
offer as of December 31, 2015, maintained a solid year-on-year growth (+13% and +8% respectively
compared to December 2014) and contributed 81% of the fixed retail broadband customer base and
63% of the wireless contract customer base. There was significant growth in the penetration of the high
value services of “Movistar Fusién”, with 31.8% of the customer base already using 100 Mb or 300 Mb
ultra-fast broadband (+10.9 p.p. year-on-year) and 62.4% of the customer base with Pay-TV as of
December 31, 2015 (+17.7 p.p. year-on-year).

Fixed accesses decreased 4.2% year-on-year, with a net loss of 442 thousand accesses in the year 2015.
This decrease was mainly due to a lower fixed access market growth.

Retail broadband accesses totaled 6.0 million and grew 1.3% year-on-year, with net adds of 76
thousand accesses, due to the good evolution of fiber adds (+37.1% year-on-year) and lower churn (1.4%
in 2015, -0.1 p.p. year-on-year).

Fiber accesses posted a new record in terms of net adds (0.9 million new accesses in 2015), reaching 2.2
million customers (1.7 times compared to December 31, 2014), representing 37.3% of total broadband
customers (+14.9 p.p. year-on-year). Two thirds of fiber accesses are benefiting from the new speeds (30
and 300 Mb) launched in May 2015.

Ultra-speed fiber accesses, with 100 or 300 Mb (with additional ARPU of 12 euros, including VAT) reached
1.5 million accesses (68.6% of total fiber accesses), after the new record of 0.5 million accesses in 2015,
triggered by the higher level of adds (+25.9% year-on-year) and contained churn (0.9%, +0.1 p.p. year-
on-year).

At December 31, 2015 our fiber deployment reached 14.3 million premises, 4 million more than at
December 31, 2014.

Total mobile accesses stood at 17.3 million, down 1.8% compared with year-end 2014 as a result of the
decrease in prepay accesses. The contract access base accelerated its growth during 2015, growing by
1.6% year-on-year. The positive evolution of contract portability (-162 thousand customers at December
31, 2015, compared to -508 thousand customers at December 31, 2014), resulted in a positive contract
net adds base (excluding M2M) (+68 thousand customers at December 31, 2015, compared to -113
thousand customers at December 31, 2014). Smartphone penetration stood at 66.3% of the mobile
voice base (+5.7 p.p. compared to year-end 2014) and significantly boosted data traffic growth to 86.8%
year-on-year in 2015 due to the higher number of customers with the renewed portfolio containing
superior data packages.

LTE network rollout continued to progress well and coverage reached (based on our estimates)
approximately 75% of the population at the end of 2015, up 17 p.p. compared to December 31, 2014,
due to the deployment of the 800 MHz. As a result, the LTE customer base reached 3.3 million customers
at December 31, 2015, doubling the customer base at December 31, 2014, while the penetration reached
21% (+10 p.p. year-on-year).

Pay-TV accesses reached 3.7 million, up by 94.8% in reported terms compared to December 31, 2014 as
aresult of the acquisition of DTS (+10.5% in organic terms), including 926 thousand satellite TV accesses
from DTS.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Spain, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate
2015/2014 variations in organic terms:

e Changes in the scope of consolidation: We have excluded the impact of changes in our
consolidation perimeter in 2015 and 2014. The only change to our Telefonica Spain
consolidation perimeter in such years is related to the consolidation of DTS in Telefonica Spain
since May 1, 2015. In order to exclude the impact of such change in our perimeter, we have
consolidated DTS'’s results from May 1 to December 31, 2014 in our 2014 results.

e Restructuring costs: We have excluded the impact of the 2,896 million euros of restructuring
costs in 2015, mainly those related to the Voluntary Suspension Plan in Spain. The restructuring
process is aimed at increasing future efficiency, representing a further step towards the
transformation and simplification initiatives carried out by Telefénica.

No restructuring costs were excluded from our 2014 results to calculate organic variations.

e Results of tower sales: The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2015 and 2014 have
been excluded in both years. In 2015, the results from the sale of towers totaled 38 million euros.
In 2014, the results from the sale of towers totaled 191 million euros.

e Spectrum acquisition: We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2015, which
totaled 49 million euros.

e Real Estate Efficiency Plan: We have excluded the impact of certain urban assets qualification
changes in Telefénica Spain in 2014, totaling 49 million euros.

e Spain distribution channel: We have excluded the impact of the 30 million euros provision
recorded in 2015 in Telefonica Spain to optimize the distribution network.

Results Discussion

Revenues in Telefonica Spain in 2015 were 12,402 million euros, up 3.2% year-on-year in reported terms
mainly as a result of the consolidation of DTS since May 1, 2015 (which accounted for +5.4 p.p. of the
year-on-year increase). In organic terms, revenues were down by 2.1% due to lower mobile service
revenues in the mobile business and lower access and voice revenues in the fixed business.

We consider revenue breakdown to be increasingly less relevant given the high penetration level of our
convergent offer, by which we mean the offer of more than a single service for a single price. However, we
continue to report revenue separately for information purposes. Fixed business revenues were up by
9.6% year-on-year in 2015, due to the consolidation of DTS, the repositioning of tariffs, higher retail
broadband revenues and new services, mainly related to TV and IT services. Excluding the impact of DTS,
fixed revenues increased by 1.9%. Mobile business revenues fell 4.8% year-on-year in 2015 due to the
decline in mobile accesses and the 3.6% drop in ARPU.

Mobile ARPU was 15.3 euros in 2015, down by 3.6% year-on-year. Mobile ARPU is becoming less
representative of the Group's business performance, owing to its high dependence on the allocation of
revenue in convergent offers.

TELEFONICA SPAIN 2014 2015 %YoY
Voice Traffic (millions of minutes) 35,600 36,368 2.2%
ARPU (EUR) 15.9 15.3 (3.6%)
Prepay 6.2 5.7 (8.2%)
Contract (1) 20.6 19.5 (5.3%)
Data ARPU (EUR) 7.0 7.8 11.0%
% non-SMS over data revenues 95.0% 95.5% 0.5 p.p.
Notes:

(1) Excludes M2M.

OIBDA amounted to 2,336 million euros in 2015, down 58.8% year-on-year in reported terms, mainly
due to provisions recorded in 2015 totaling 2,926 million euros (relating to restructuring cost accounted
for 51.1 p.p. of the year-on-year decrease and 0.5 p.p. of the year-on-year decrease in distribution
channel restructuring) and, to a lesser extent, the lower proceeds (38 million euros in 2015 compared to
191 million euros in 2014) from the sale of towers (-2.7 p.p.). This decrease was partially offset by the
sale of real estate assets amounting to 73 million euros (net of costs).

In organic terms OIBDA decreased 4.3% year-on-year, mainly due to the lower revenues, higher
personnel costs and higher content costs. The higher personnel costs, up by 4.0% year-on-year in organic
terms, were primarily due to the resumption of the Company's contribution to its pension plan in July
2014, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of DTS. Telefonica Spain had 32,171 employees at the end of
December 2015, up 7.2% year-on-year, due mainly to the acquisition of DTS.

OIBDA margin was 18.8% in 2015, down 28.3 p.p. year-on-year.

In 2015, Telefonica United Kingdom maintained market momentum, as a result of 02's brand
recognition, the success of commercial proposal success and customer loyalty. These factors have
allowed the company to keep growing in a competitive market.

The total access base grew 2.3% year-on-year and stood at 25.3 million at December 31, 2015, mainly
driven by a 2.2% increase in the mobile base.

The contract mobile customer base grew 5.4% year-on-year and reached 14.5 million accesses, with a
broadly stable 57.8% share over the total mobile base. Net adds reached 539 thousand accesses due to
the solid contribution of postpay accesses. Smartphone penetration reached 60% of the total mobile
accesses base, up 15.4 p.p. year-on-year, driven by the continued growth of LTE customers (+85.8%
year-on-year reaching 7.6 million at December 31, 2015). LTE penetration reached 35% of the total
mobile access base.

The prepay access base decreased 1.9% year-on-year to 10.6 million at December 31, 2015.

To calculate the organic growth for 2015 of Telefonica United Kingdom, we have made the following

adjustments:

e Exchange rate effect: we have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming
constant average foreign exchange rates for 2014 and 2015. In particular, we have used the

average foreign exchange rates of 2014 for both years.

e Restructuring costs: we have excluded the impact from 2015 of restructuring costs, associated
with certain simplification processes implemented in Telefonica United Kingdom amounting to 4
million euros. There were not restructuring costs in Telefonica United Kingdom results in 2014.

The table below shows 2015/2014 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in
accordance with the adjustments referred to above) of certain income statement measures, and the

Results Discussion

Total revenues were 7,837 million euros in 2015, up 11.0% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to
the appreciation of the pound sterling (which accounted for 11 p.p. of the year-on-year increase). In
organic terms, revenues decreased by 0.1% year-on-year due mainly to lower handset sales, down by
13.9%.

e¢ Mobile service revenues totaled 5,778 million euros in 2015, up 7.1% year-on-year in reported
terms due mainly to the appreciation of the pound sterling (which accounted for 10.7 p.p. of the
year-on-year increase). Excluding this impact, mobile service revenues decreased by 3.6% due to
the “Refresh” commercial model as well as the low interconnection fares. Under the Refresh
commercial model, certain revenues related to handset are not considered as mobile service
revenues, but as handset revenues.

Mobile ARPU increased by 2.9% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to the appreciation of the
pound sterling. In organic terms, ARPU went down by 7.3% adversely affected by the “Refresh”
commercial model, as well as a decrease in data ARPU of 5.7%. Revenues under the “Refresh”
commercial model, are not considered as service revenues but as handset revenues, therefore,
smartphone sales are not reflected in ARPU.

(2) In the fourth quarter of 2014, 428 thousand E-Plus accesses were excluded before integration, due to the criteria harmonization.

In 2015, Telefonica Germany maintained market momentum, increasing slightly its estimated mobile
service revenue market share.

The total access base grew 1.5% year-on-year and stood at 48.4 million at December 31, 2015, mainly
driven by a 2.2% increase in the mobile base (which reached 43.1 million).

The contract mobile customer base grew 1.6% year-on-year and reached 19.1 million accesses, with a
broadly stable 44.3% share over the total mobile base. Net adds reached 309 thousand accesses due to
the solid contribution of partners (second brands). Smartphone penetration reached 54.2% of the total
mobile access base, up 5.5 p.p. year-on-year driven by the continued growth of LTE customers (+154.5%
year-on-year reaching 7.9 million at December 31, 2015). LTE penetration reached 18.6% of the total
mobile access base.

The prepay access base increased 2.7% year-on-year to 24.0 million. Prepay posted 629 thousand net
additions in 2015, 32.5% more than in 2014 due to the strong contribution from wholesale agreements
(second brands). The retail broadband access loss trend continued to improve, with 46 thousand net loss
in 2015, more than halving the number of 2014. VDSL was once again the main growth engine of fixed
performance with 260 thousand net additions (+55% year-on-year) in 2015.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

With respect to Telefonica Germany, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate
2015/2014 variations in organic terms:

The tabl

Changes in the scope of consolidation: We have excluded the impact of changes in our
consolidation perimeter in 2015 and 2014. The only change to our Telefénica Germany
consolidation perimeter in such years related to the consolidation of E-Plus in Telefonica
Germany since October 1, 2014. In order to exclude the impact of this change in our perimeter,
we have consolidated E-Plus's results from January 1 to September 30, 2014 in our 2014 results.

Restructuring costs: We have excluded the impact of restructuring costs associated with
certain simplification processes implemented in Germany. In 2015, restructuring costs had a 74
million euros impact on OIBDA. In 2014, restructuring costs had a 414 million euros impact on
OIBDA.

Spectrum acquisition: We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2015,
amounting to 1,198 million euros. There were no spectrum acquisitions in 2014.

Adjustments to the final purchase price of E-Plus: In 2015 we have excluded the result from
the difference between the preliminary purchase price of E-Plus (as estimated at the end of the
valuation period) and the final purchase price agreed with KPN, totaling 104 million euros (which
had a 102 million euros positive impact on OIBDA net of costs related to the acquisition).

Results Discussion

Total revenues were 7,888 million euros in 2015, up 42.9% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to
the consolidation of E-Plus since October 1, 2014 (which accounted for 41.1 p.p. of the year-on-year
increase). In organic terms, revenues increased by 1.2% due mainly to higher handset sales arising from
Christmas campaigns.

Mobile service revenues totaled 5,532 million euros in 2015, up 54.5% year-on-year in reported terms,
due mainly to the consolidation of E-Plus since October 1, 2014 and to a lesser extent, the increasing
share of the partner segment (second brands) within the customer base. Telefonica Germany continued
to focus on data revenues, which increased by 58.4% and accounted for 51.3% of mobile service
revenues in 2015. Non-P2P SMS data revenues amounted to 2,034 million euros (increasing 4.9% year-
on-year), accounting for 71.6% of the total data revenues (+0.4 p.p. year-on-year).

Fixed revenues were 1,043 million euros in 2015, down 8.3% year-on-year, due to continued decrease in
accesses.

Mobile ARPU was 10.7 euros in 2015, down 8.9% year-on-year, while contract ARPU stood at 17.2 euros
down 6.5% year-on-year, as a result of the higher share of wholesale customers in the customer base.
Data ARPU was 5.5 euros, down 6.8% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the continued decline of SMS
volumes.

OIBDA totaled 1,858 million euros in 2015, up 153.7% year-on-year in reported terms, as a result mainly
of the consolidation of E-Plus (which accounted for 50.2 p.p. of the increase), the lower restructuring
costs recorded in 2015 (+46.5 p.p.) and the positive result from the E-Plus preliminary acquisition price
and the final acquisition price agreed on with KPN (+13.9 p.p.). In organic terms, OIBDA increased by
20.9% year-on-year, driven by the increased synergies, which mainly affected personnel expenses and
supplies.

Telefonica Brazil closed the year 2015 improving its competitive position in the mobile as well as in the
fixed market. In the mobile business, Telefonica Brazil kept its leadership in the higher value segments,
which permitted the operator to capture mobile market revenue growth in 2015. In the fixed business,
the transformation towards fiber and Pay-TV was strengthened by the GVT consolidation in May 2015,
adding as of December 31, 2015, 8.5 million customers to the Group.

Revenues and OIBDA evolution were positively supported by the acceleration of mobile data and the
good evolution of fixed broadband and Pay-TV. Additionally, Telefonica Brazil carried out costs control
measures aimed at offsetting the adverse macroeconomic situation.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis. With respect to
Telefonica Brazil, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate 2015/2014 variations in
organic terms:

Foreign exchange effects: We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by
assuming constant average foreign exchange rates in 2015 and 2014. In particular, we have used
the average foreign exchange rate of 2014 for both years. Foreign exchange rates had a negative
impact on our reported 2015 Telefénica Brazil results as a result of the depreciation of the
Brazilian real.

Changes in the scope of consolidation: We have excluded the impact of changes in our
consolidation perimeter in 2015 and 2014. The only change to our Telefonica Brazil consolidation
perimeter in such years related to the consolidation of GVT since May 1, 2015. In order to
exclude the impact of this change in our perimeter, we have consolidated GVT's results from May
1 to December 31, 2014 in our 2014 results.

Restructuring costs: We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs associated
with certain simplification processes implemented in Telefénica Brazil. In 2015, these
restructuring costs totaled 7 million euros. In 2014, these restructuring costs totaled 68 million
euros.

Spectrum acquisition: We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2014
amounting to 889 million euros (related to a LTE block in the 700 MHz band) while there were no
spectrum acquisitions in 2015.

Results of tower sales: The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2015 and 2014 have
been excluded in both years. The results from the sale of towers totaled 10 million euros and 1
million euros in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Results Discussion

Revenues totaled 11,060 million euros in 2015, down 1.5% in reported terms, mainly due to the
depreciation of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -16.6 p.p. of the evolution) and partially offset by
the impact of the consolidation of GVT (+10.1 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year variation was
4.5%, principally due to the good evolution in the mobile business (+6.2% year-on-year) as well as the
fixed business (+1.9% year-on-year), which was partially offset by the impact of the regulatory
interconnection tariff reduction (-2.7 p.p. of the year-on-year variation).

e Revenues from the mobile business totaled 6,906 million euros in 2015, down 9.3% in
reported terms due mainly to the depreciation of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -15.3
p.p. of the evolution). Excluding this impact, revenues from the mobile business increased by
6.2% due to the positive evolution of service revenues (+5.3% year-on-year) as a result of the
good performance of outbound revenues, which increased as a result of an increase in the
contract customer base and the higher data penetration. This trend was partially offset by lower
inbound revenues affected by lower interconnection tariffs. Handset revenues were up by 5.1%
in reported terms, due to higher proportion of contract add and higher smartphones and LTE
handset sales.

e Fixed telephony revenues totaled 4,154 million euros, up by 15.0% in reported terms due
mainly to the consolidation of GVT (+31.9 p.p.) and were partially offset by the impact of
depreciation of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -19.4 p.p. of the evolution). Excluding
these effects, revenues were up by 1.9%, mainly due to the increase in fixed broadband
revenues, which were up by 9.3% supported by the increase of fiber and the growth of Pay TV
accesses with higher ARPU, in spite of the lower retail fixed-mobile tariff (-2.5 p.p.).

The mobile ARPU decreased 13.2% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to depreciation of the
Brazilian real. In organic terms, it increased 1.6% year-on-year as a consequence of the higher data ARPU
which more than offset the negative impact of the reduction in the mobile termination rates. We believe
the high quality of the customer base is reflected in an increase in the outbound ARPU and the 31.5%
growth in the data ARPU.

Notes:

OIBDA stood at 3,573 million euros in 2015, up 0.9% in reported terms due mainly to the consolidation
of GVT (which accounted for +12.5 p.p. of the evolution) and, to a lesser extent, the lower restructuring
costs incurred in 2015 compared to 2014 (+1.7 p.p.), and the higher results from the sale of towers
compared to 2014 (+0.3 p.p.), all of which was partially offset by the negative impact of the depreciation
of the Brazilian real (-17.0 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year increase was 2.9% due to revenue
growth and cost efficiency offsetting a worse macro scenario with higher inflation, high devaluation and a
higher rate of bad debt. Personnel expenses totaled 1,042 million euros in 2015, up 6.8% in reported
terms as result mainly of the consolidation of GVT, which was partially offset by the depreciation of the
Brazilian real. In organic terms, personnel expenses increased by 3.5% year-on-year due to higher social
benefits and the internalization of the work of certain network contractors which more than offset the
savings resulting from restructuring plans in 2014. In addition, network costs grew due to higher energy
costs and the deployment and improvement of fixed- and mobile networks, legal contingencies and
higher content costs. OIBDA was also positively impacted by the expiration of a payment obligation (98
million euros).

The OIBDA margin stood at 32.3% in reported terms for 2015, up 0.8 p.p. compared to 2014.

(2) Includes 50 thousand "fixed wireless" additional customers in Peru, in the second quarter of 2014.
(3) In the fourth quarter of 2014, 1.8 millions of inactive customers were disconnected in Central America.

Total accesses in Telefénica Hispanoamérica reached 134.6 million accesses at December 31, 2015
(+2.3% year-on-year).

Mobile accesses totaled 113.3 million (+2.7% year-on-year) due to positive net adds of 3.0 million
accesses.

e There was strong contract segment growth, which expanded by 5.6% year-on-year. Growth was
particularly strong in Peru (+12.9% year-on-year), Mexico (+22.3% year-on-year) and Chile
(+4.2% year-on-year). Annual net adds reached 1.3 million accesses, primarily due to Peru (+659
thousand net adds) which benefitted from a successful migration strategy (from prepay to
contract). Mexico also showed positive net adds (+327 thousand accesses) due to higher
commercial activity.

e Inthe prepay segment (+1.9% year-on-year), with net adds of 1.6 million customers, growth was
driven mainly by Mexico (+2.9 million customers) while Venezuela and Central America closed
with 1.2 million net adds, partially compensating the net loss in Chile (-0.9 million customers)
and Peru (-0.7 million customers) where we have faced a fierce competition and we have
concentrated on high value customers migrating the best prepaid customers to contract and not
following competition offers that would damage the quality of our networks due to intense
traffic.

e There was growth in smartphones (+43.7% year-on-year) to 40.2 million accesses as of
December 31, 2015, with a penetration over mobile accesses of 36.7% (+10.4 p.p. year-on-year),
related mainly to Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Colombia. 4G handsets also continued to grow,
reaching 8.3 million accesses as of December 31, 2015 (corresponding to a penetration of 7.4%).

Traditional fixed business accesses stood at 12.8 million at December 31, 2015 (-4.1% year-on-year),
with negative net adds of 545 thousand customers, affected by the erosion of traditional fixed business
in the region, including Chile (-5.9% year-on-year), Peru (-4.4% year-on-year), Colombia (-2.1% year-on-
year) and Argentina (-1.9% year-on-year).

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Broadband accesses totaled 5.6 million at December 31, 2015 (+4.3% year-on-year), after reaching net
adds of 0.2 million accesses during 2015 due mainly to access growth in Peru (+8.0%), Chile (+5.8%) and
Colombia (+4.0%). The penetration of fixed broadband accesses over traditional fixed business accesses
was 43.7% at December 31, 2015 (+3.5 p.p. year-on-year). There was progressive migration towards
data plans with higher speeds, with 53.4% of broadband accesses having a speed over 4Mb at December
31, 2015 (+4 p.p. year-on-year).

Pay TV accesses totaled 2.8 million (+15.6% year-on-year), with net adds of 0.4 million accesses as a
result of an improvement in all countries in the region that offer the service. Growth was particularly
positive in Peru (+26.7% year-on-year), Colombia (+17.5%) and Chile (+7.2%).

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Hispanoamérica, we have made the following adjustments in order to
calculate 2015/2014 variations in organic terms:

e Foreign exchange effects and the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela:
We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average
foreign exchange rates in 2015 and 2014. In particular, we have used the average foreign
exchange rates of 2014 for both years.

We have also excluded the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela.

e Restructuring costs: We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs associated
with certain simplification processes implemented in Telefonica Hispanoamérica. In 2015,
restructuring costs totaled 38 million euros. In 2014, restructuring costs totaled 99 million euros.

e Results of tower sales: The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2015 and 2014 have
been excluded, which totaled 18 million euros (mainly in Chile) in 2015 and 4 million euros in
2014.

Results Discussion

Revenues amounted to 14,387 million euros in 2015, increasing 9.4% year-on-year in reported terms
mainly due to the good results of data revenues (fixed as well as mobile) and voice revenues, in both
cases due to a higher customer base, increased consumption and higher data penetration. This increase
was partially offset by foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in Venezuela and the decrease in
mobile termination rates. In organic terms, revenues increased 10.1% year-on-year.

Mobile service revenues reached 9,160 million euros in 2015, up 8.4% year-on-year in reported
terms mainly due to increased revenues in Argentina, Peru, Mexico and Chile, as explained in
greater a detail below, which was partially offset by the foreign exchange effects and the

hyperinfl

jation in Venezuela (which accounted for -2.2 p.p. of the year-on-year variation). Mobile

service revenues performance by country was as follows:

n Argentina, mobile service revenues reached 2,194 million euros in 2015 and grew by
29.2% year-on-year in reported terms mainly due to the good performance of
consumption and data penetration and, to a lesser extent, the growth of the voice
business and the foreign exchange effect (which increased growth by 6.4 p.p.). In local
currency, these revenues grew by 22.9%.

n Mexico, mobile service revenues reached 1,539 million euros in 2015, increasing by
8.9% in reported terms mainly due to a higher customer base and the positive
performance of the data business. In local currency these revenues grew by 8.4%,
accounting the foreign exchange effect for 0.5 p.p. of the year-on-year reported
increase.

n Chile, mobile service revenues reached 1,177 million euros in 2015, up 5.8% in
reported terms year-on-year mainly due to the foreign exchange effect (which
accounted for 4.6 p.p. of the increase) and the increase in data revenues, which more

Telefonica Argentina, Telefonica Peru and Telefénica Chile the main contributors to this growth, as higher
revenues offset higher costs. OIBDA was positively affected by a spectrum swap in Mexico with AT&T in
December 2015 (which contributed 79 million euros). The higher costs were mainly attributable to:

e higher commercial costs, due to higher handset costs as a result of higher high-end handset
sales (which more than offset lower interconnection costs resulting from the mobile termination
rates reductions in Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico);

e higher personnel costs driven by increases

in inflation in some countries of the region;

e higher costs related to commercial campaigns, higher network costs due to higher voice and data

traffic; and

e higher costs resulting from the devaluation of certain Latin American currencies against the U.S.

e Argentina: OIBDA reached 1,006 million euros, up by 25.4% in reported terms mainly due to the
exchange rate effect and higher service revenues, more than offsetting the higher costs resulting
from the overall prices increase, although Telefonica continued to carry out cost containment
plans in order to offset the inflation effect. In local currency, the year-on-year variation was
19.2%.

e Chile: OIBDA reached 760 million euros, up 7.4% in reported terms mainly due to the exchange
rate effect and higher service revenues, lower supply costs due to regulatory changes (lower
interconnection costs resulting from the mobile termination rates reduction) and efficiency
measures that helped to offset the commercial effort made to gain higher value customers. In
local currency, the year-on-year variation was 2.7%.

e Peru: OIBDA reached 943 million euros, up by 11.8% in reported terms mainly due to the
exchange rate effect and higher service revenues, which more than offset higher commercial
costs resulting from higher competitive pressure in the Peruvian market. In local currency OIBDA
decreased by 4.7% year-on-year.

e Venezuela and Central America: OIBDA reached 342 million euros, down by 26.1% in reported
terms mainly due to the exchange rate effect and hyperinflation in Venezuela. Excluding these
impacts, OIBDA grew 15.8% mainly driven by higher service revenues, which compensated the
overall rise in prices, and higher purchases in dollars for services and equipment purchases, which
were affected by the currency devaluation in Venezuela.

OIBDA margin reached 30.3% in 2015, with a year-on-year decrease of 0.6 p.p. in reported terms. This
margin decrease was driven by lower margins in all countries in the segment except Mexico (which
benefitted from higher commercial efforts focused on higher value segments), especially in Argentina and
Colombia.

Availability of funds

As of December 31, 2016, Telefénica’s liquidity, amounting to 21,274 million euros, includes: undrawn
committed credit facilities arranged with banks for an amount of 14,627 million euros (of which 13,491
million euros maturing in more than 12 months); and cash equivalents and current financial assets other
than those in Venezuela.

Additional information on sources of liquidity and undrawn lines of credit available to the Company, on
liquidity risk management, on the Company's debt levels, and on capital management is provided in
Notes 12, 13 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Contractual commitments

Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements provides information on firm commitments giving rise
to future cash outflows and associated with purchases and services received in relation to the Company's
principal activity, and any operating leases for buildings and assets related to the Company's activity,
primarily.

Credit risk management

The Telefonica Group considers credit risk management as a key element to achieve its business and
customer base growth targets in a manner that is both sustainable and consistent with Telefonica
Corporate Risk Management Policy. This management approach relies on the active monitoring of the
risk-reward balance within the commercial operations and on the adequate separation between the risk
ownership and risk management functions.

Formal delegation of authority procedures and management practices are implemented in all Group
companies, taking into account benchmark risk management techniques but adapted to the local
characteristics of each market. Debtors that may cause a relevant impact on the Telefonica Group
consolidated financial statements and increased risk profile products — due to customer target, term,
channels or other commercial characteristics - are subject to specific management practices in order to
mitigate the exposure to credit risk. These procedures include:

e Statistical and expert models for customer acquisition that are used to forecast and to manage
the expected probability of default of the transactions.

¢ Decision tools allowing the implementation of tailored credit strategies by product, channel,
geography and type of customer.

¢ Continuous monitoring of the payment behavior and solvency of the customer portfolio.

e Internal and external collection processes designed to increase recovery through differentiated
actions by debt age and customer profile.

¢ Ongoing controls over the credit risk exposure performed by specific committees.

The commercial credit risk management strategy is embedded in the day-to-day operational processes
guiding both the product and services available for the different customer profile and the management
practices all through the customer life-cycle.

Credit rating

At December 31, 2016, Telef6nica, S.A.’s long-term issuer default rating is "BBB stable outlook" from
Fitch, “Baa3 stable outlook" from Moody's and "BBB stable outlook" from Standard & Poor's. During
2016, there have been changes in the credit ratings by the three agencies. Moody’s downgraded the
rating to “Baa3 stable” from “Baa2 negative” on November 7, 2016, Fitch downgraded the rating to “BBB

stable" from “BBB+ stable” on September 5, 2016 and Standards and Poor's revised the outlook to
“stable” from “positive” on May 17, 2016.

European Commission's decision to block the proposed sale of 02 U.K. to Hutchison's Three U.K. had an
impact on Telefénica’s credit ratings and outlooks by Moody’s and Standards and Poor's, as they
considered that such decision would delay the Company’s deleveraging process. In 2016, among the
measures taken to protect the credit rating, it is noteworthy the change in the shareholder remuneration
policy (see dividend policy below), together with the announcement of the commitment to maintain a
solid investment grade credit rating. Additionally, it is worth highlighting the strong financing activity
undertaken during 2016 together with the maintenance of an appropriate level of liquidity, an active
portfolio management through the announced intention to continue analyzing best strategic alternatives
for 02 UK and Telxius, the executed sale of Telefé and the partial disposal of China Unicom, as well as the
issuance of undated deeply subordinated securities as a solvency protection measure to mitigate
negative impacts on our consolidated financial statements.

Dividend policy

Telefonica, S.A.'s dividend policy is revised yearly based on the Group's earnings, cash generation,
solvency, liquidity, flexibility to make strategic investments, and shareholder and investor expectations.
In 2016, the Annual General Meeting approved to pay a dividend, via scrip dividend of approximately 0.35
euros per share to be paid in November 2016.

On October 27, 2016, the Board of Directors of Telefénica, S.A. decided to modify the dividend policy for
the years 2016 and 2017, announcing for the year 2016 the payment of 0.55 euros per share, adding to
the scrip approved by the Annual Shareholders Meeting, the payment of 0.20 euros in cash in the second
quarter of 2017. Relating to 2017, it was announced that the dividend would amount to 0.40 euros per
share: 0.20 euros in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.20 euros in the second quarter of 2018. Both
tranches would be paid in cash.

On November 2016, Telefonica launched a scrip dividend issue to allow shareholders to choose to receive
new shares in place of a cash dividend (which may be replaced by selling the associated subscription
rights to the Company at a pre-established price), while enabling the Company to reduce its debt,
depending on the take-up rate of the conversion.

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Share price performance

European equity markets posted a volatile performance in 2016, a year characterized by various political
events. The first months of the year were affected by doubts around economic growth in China, which
negatively affected the performance of emerging countries. In June, the United Kingdom voted in a
referendum not to continue in the European Union, which triggered sharp drops in the markets, reaching
annual lows. In November, the elections in the United States once again generated an increase of
volatility in the markets. With regard to monetary policy, the ECB expanded its debt repurchasing
program and lowered interest rates to 0% with the aim of generating higher economic activity and
increasing inflation levels. The Federal Reserve, in turn, delayed the expected interest rate increase until
December.

In this context, the main European indexes closed 2016 with a mixed performance (EStoxx-50 +0.7%);
highlighting the positive performance of the FTSE-100 (+14.4%), which was driven by the high weight of
mining companies and the depreciation of the sterling pound, which favored exporters and multinational
companies with limited exposure to the domestic market; DAX (+6.9%), CAC-40 (+4.9%). The Ibex-35 (-
2.0%) along with the FTSEMIB (-10.2%) were the only indexes closing the year with losses as a result of
their exposure to emerging markets and, in the case of the Italian index, uncertainty regarding the
banking sector.

Among sectors included in the European DJ Stoxx-600 (-1.2%), basic resources (+61.9%), oil & gas
(+22.9%) and construction & materials (+9.2%), led positive performances, whereas health care (-
0.2%), travel & leisure (-11.1%) and telecommunications (-15.8%) posted losses. The relative worse
performance of the telecommunications sector during the year is due to the cancellation of certain
corporate transactions, adverse regulatory news, weak revenue growth trends, and concerns over capex
increases, along with rotation towards more cyclical sectors following the elections in the United States.

Telefonica share closed 2016 at 8.82 euros per share, with a total shareholder return of -6.3%, reflecting
the evolution of the share price (-13.8%) and dividends distributed in the year (0.40 euros in cash and
0.35 euros in scrip). The profitability is higher than that of the sector in Europe, which showed a total
shareholder return after dividends of -11.7%.

Telefonica closed the 2016 financial year with a market capitalization of 44,433 million euros, ranking as
the eleventh company in the telecommunications sector worldwide. The daily traded volume in the
Spanish stock exchange amounted to 24.6 million shares.

Responsible business and fiscal responsibility

Responsible business

The future of Telefonica is based on promoting a responsible business model that is able to generate
trust in our customers, investors, employees, shareholders, and society. In order to promote this, we have
he global Responsible Business Plan, approved and followed by the Board's Committee for Regulation
and Institutional Affairs.

ao

This Plan sets out priorities through year 2020 in three areas: compliance and risk management,
responsible productivity and sustainability as leverage for growth to improve our business and the world.

fa)

urrently, it is focused on Customer Promise and Digital Trust; Supply Chain; Talent and Diversity;
nvironmental Management and Sustainable Innovation, with their corresponding goals and KPIs.
These take form in different local plans in the countries where we are present.

m

The Customer Promise and Digital Trust project arises from the need to continually reinforce the
relationship of trust that we have with the customer, not only in the commercial field by complying with
standards of transparency and honesty, but also in the field of privacy and security. The Responsible
Management of our Supply Chain is key if we want to guarantee compliance of ethical, social, and
environmental standards throughout our value chain. We demand compliance of these standards from all
our providers, and we perform awareness and verification actions to manage the risks, and control and
implement improvement actions. The directed management of our human resources with the goal of
attracting and retaining the best talent, including the management of diversity, are key aspects for the
success of the company's strategy. Telefonica promotes an ambitious and very effective environmental
strategy with the goal of not only managing possible risks and minimizing the impacts of the company's
activities on the environment, but also of assuming its responsibility in the mitigation of climate change.
Finally, Sustainable Innovation is the project with which Telefénica contributes to generate positive social
and environmental impacts through commercial proposals that, within a context of global growth trends,
will generate new models of sustainable business.

In 2016, in addition to the Global Responsible Business Plan, the plans for Spain, Germany, Brazil,
Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Argentina and Chile were approved.

During the year:

e A Responsible Business Advisory Panel and a extended consulting group were put together to
collect stakeholders’ expectations.

e A Chief Data Officer was named, we performed training and audits on privacy and cyber security
and we worked to give back citizens control over their digital lives.

e The Privacy Center, which informs our stakeholders about our privacy and publicity policies, was
published.

e = Telef6nica's first Report on Transparency in Communications was published.

e The Chief Compliance Officer was appointed, thus reinforcing our commitment with compliance
issues.

e Assessments of critical providers were increased through EcoVadis and we joined the JAC (Joint
Audit Cooperation) sector initiative to audit their factories.

e The Telefonica Global Diversity Council was established to promote diversity among employees.

Telefonica, S.A. 261


--- Page 75 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Newenergy and climate change goals were announced for the 2015-2030 period for the purpose
of contributing to the Paris Agreement.

e Telefonica brought to Latin America the Eco Rating, a seal for the environmental and social
impact of mobiles.

e For the third consecutive year, Telefonica was on the CDP "A-List": we are one of nine Telcos to
figure in this ranking at a global level, and the only Spanish one.

e  Movistar+ 5S was launched, a pioneering proposal to bring television to people with sensory
disabilities.

e = Telefonica, with "La Caixa", presented the ProFuturo Project to promote digital education for
children in developing countries.

e In 2016, Telefénica was one of the top nine leading companies in the world in terms of
sustainability, according to the DJSI.

Some of these advances influence the Sustainable Development Objective (SDO), in which Telcos play a
prominent role since the Internet and digital solutions are fundamental to being able to reach more than
half of the proposed goals, with connectivity as the foundation.

Fiscal Responsibility

According to the Principle of Responsible Business, Telefonica is committed to acting with honesty,
transparency and respect for the law when managing our financial issues.

The Company is adhered to the Good Tax Practices Code and committed to that established in the “OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises” regarding taxation. Consequently, Telefonica does not use
company structures in order to cover or reduce the transparency of our activities before the tax
authorities, or any other interested party. Nor is the Company present in any of the jurisdictions included
in the list of tax havens established in Spanish regulations.

To calculate the total tax contribution (the list of countries can be consulted on the web) Telefénica
follows the PwC CTT methodology, according to which the distributed value of a company is made up of
the sum of the following elements: value for the shareholder (for example: dividends, reserves, etc.)
wages and salaries (net of tax levied on employees), net interests and tax (input and levied).

Research, Development and Innovation

Telefonica remains committed to technological innovation as a fundamental tool for being one of the
main actors in the new digital universe, with the capacity to help to create a more sustainable world while
achieving competitive advantages and distinctive products. By introducing new technologies and
developing business solutions and processes, we aim to become a more effective, efficient and customer-
oriented Group.

Telefonica bases its innovation strategy on the balance between two main models:

e Promoting our internal research, development and innovation (R&D&i) capabilities, for
which we have developed our own innovation model, which allows us to promote the application
of technical research in developing commercial products and services using the knowledge
developed in research centers, technological institutes and universities, among other sources;

e Promoting the creation of open innovation ecosystems, in which the “Open Future” initiative
stands out as a global program designed to connect entrepreneurs, start-ups, investors, venture
capital funds and public and private organizations around the world which promote innovation in
collaboration with other actors.

In parallel with these two models, Telefonica seeks to promote the development of sustainable solutions
that generate a positive impact on the economic, social and technological progress of the regions in
which we operate. To this effect, in addition to the investment made in promoting sustainable innovation
projects and in the activities that are developed to guarantee the accessibility of our solutions to all
groups, a new subsidiary has been created that is focused on product innovation and the development of
disruptive technologies.

Telefonica firmly believes that competitive advantage can not be based solely on acquired technology,
and so has always considered the promotion of internal innovation, research and development activities
as a strategic axis, in an effort to achieve this differentiation and move forward in other activities which
guarantee the sustainability of our business.

To this effect, the Telefonica Group's internal innovation policy focuses on contributing with solutions
that guarantee Telefonica's commitment to developing a responsible business under the criteria of
economic, social and environmental sustainability, by:

e Developing new products and services that enable growth and competition in an increasingly global
environment, while being adapted to the diversity and local needs of each market;

e Encouraging the return of innovation through open innovation and creating value from the technology
generated;

e Increasing our customers’ loyalty and satisfaction;
e Increasing the revenues, profits and value of the Company;

e Increasing the quality of our infrastructure and services, as well as our relationship with our
technology providers and solutions;

e Improving business processes and operations with the aim of optimizing resources, increasing
efficiency and reducing environmental impact;

During 2016 we carried out numerous technological innovation projects focused on sustainability,
process efficiency, the creation of new sources of revenue, customer satisfaction, the consolidation of our
presence in new markets and technological leadership.

Telefonica, S.A. 263

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

We also initiated projects to promote an increase in the access to information technology, new services
focused on new Internet business models, advanced user interfaces, distribution of TV and multimedia
contents and other value added services, taking advantage of the potential of the new infrastructures.
These projects, among others, were undertaken based on our objective to quickly identify emerging
technologies that may have a relevant impact on our business, and to test these technologies on pilots
related to new platform services, applications and prototypes.

A significant part of the innovation activities and projects are carried out by Telefonica Investigacion y
Desarrollo S.A.U. (Telefonica |+D), a wholly owned subsidiary gives support mainly to our business lines.
Telefonica I+D receives support from other companies and universities in the execution of its functions.
The mission of the company is focused on improving our competitiveness through technological
innovation and product development. Telefénica |+D is also responsible for experimental and applied
research and for the development of products to increase our range of services and reduce operating
costs.

The technological innovation activities of Telefonica I+D focus on three main areas:

1. The development of new networks, mainly carried out in collaboration with Telefonica's Global
Resources area. These activities are related to new radio and fibre optic access technologies
(technologies on the virtualization of network functions, in line with the technological trend
known as SDN or defined networks via software) and on topics related to network optimization
and zero touch, which enable us to have a much more flexible and adaptable network that is
dynamically adaptable to the new requirements of digital services and customers.

2. The development of new products and services which are carried out within the framework of
the digital services strategy. The following stand out among these activities:

o Interpersonal communication of the future with natural access, taking advantage of the
possibilities of the Internet and smartphones;

o Services related to Big Data, regarding the concept of the Fourth Platform, whose vision
is to return the value associated with the data it generates to the customer;

o Video and multimedia services (combining text, audio, images and video) with a user
experience on all connected devices;

o Advanced solutions in emerging ICT businesses, such as cloud computing cloud or
security;

o Management of Internet of Things (loT) services, related to enriched mobility, energy
efficiency and smart retail;

o Using users’ communication profiles to obtain opportunities to exploit different
products and business models (marketing campaigns, targeted advertising, contextual
services, churn reduction, cross-selling, etc.).

3. Experimental and applied research: With a medium and long-term outlook, Telefénica also has
“Scientific Groups” whose mission is to investigate the possibilities of new networks and services
and to solve the technological, social and environmental challenges that arise.

It should be noted that in 2016 Telefonica I+D Chile, a 100% subsidiary of Telefonica Chile, which was
launched in 2014 in collaboration with the Chilean government, for the development of the first products
and the generation of the first patents in “enriched mobility", Smart Industry and Smart Agro.

As of December 31, 2016, Telefonica 1+D had 612 employees (654 employees in 2015).

million euros incurred in 2015 (1,111 million euros in 2014). This expense represents 1.7%, 1.9% and
2.2% of the Group's consolidated revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These figures were
calculated using guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

During 2016, Telefonica registered 27 new patent applications, including three through the American
office (USPTO), two through the Chilean office (INAPI) and 22 through the Spanish patent and trademark
office (OEPM), seven of which were international (PCT) and 15 European applications. Moreover, one
utility model was registered in the Spanish patent and trademark office, also through the OEPM.

Regarding the development of open innovation in Telefonica, the company has the Open Future_ unit,
which includes an open, global program designed to connect entrepreneurs, startups, investors, and
public and private organizations from around the world.

The main objective of Open Future_ is to detect, develop and enhance the talent and technological
entrepreneurship in all its phases, for that which drives and accelerates the growth of ideas, projects,
initiatives and companies. The integral character of Telefonica Open Future enables innovation to be
developed in different stages. It is structured around seven initiatives, the objectives of which are as
follows:

e Drive (Think Big and Talentum Startups).
e Accelerate (Crowdworking and Wayra).
e Invest (Telefénica Ventures, Amérigo and CIP Telefonica).

Telefonica Open Future, is present in 16 countries, ended 2016 as one of the main investors in the
Spanish area of open innovation, positioning itself as one of the major funds in Europe and Latin america
in venture capital investment.

Human Resources

Objectives and policies

At Telefonica people are important and are the core of the business, representing one of the Group's
greatest assets. Our aim as HR department is to develop our employees’ capacities to the maximum in
order to fulfill the compromises agreed with our customers.

Our vision is based on four main pillars:

e Recruit, develop and keep the talented employees to ensure the Company meets its strategic
goals.

e Support the business units integration and the transformation process so that the companies
are aligned with the business objectives.

e Build a customer-focused organization culture.

e Become a 100% online department with high self-service options in the HR internal processes
and with outsourced resources and provide an integrated human resources experience for
middle management and employees based on empowerment and simplification.

In 2016 the implementation of SuccessFactors (the new digital, online, multi-gadget, cloud-based and
global tool for human resources management) affected all employees, unifying the performance,
successions and development, recruiting and learning processes.

The most notable aspects of the change include the implementation of the central employee module in
eight countries.

Managing talent

At Telefonica we are convinced that our professionals are the Company's main asset and we believe in
fully developing their potential so they can make our customers’ dreams a reality. We have therefore
developed a talent-based model that will accompany the employees throughout their career, identifying
key skills and abilities that will help employees handle our transformation process, a line with the
Company's strategy and the program “We choose it all”.

This model is used when evaluating executive talent, driving a culture of meritocracy, and facilitating the
decision-making process on aspects such as development, organization and compensation, among other
aspects; this allows our organization to have a management talent map, as well as a structured
succession plan.

Based on this model and having detected key needs for the future, we promote global talent programs
that contribute to the professional development of our teams in order to better implement the
Companus strategy at the various levels and segments, from young employees to executives.

Approximately 100 young people from all areas of the Company took part in the Young Leaders Program,
which focused on the development of digital and transformative capacities to better prepare this group of
young talent for the future. After the 2016 edition ended in September, the selection process began for
the 2017 edition, in which 86 young people from 11 countries will participate, 53% of which are women.

For the Profile for Digital Transformation project, in 2016 we also invited more than 2,300 Company
leaders from different levels of the organization. This allowed us to obtain solid results at the Company,
transaction and functional unit level, identifying specific development needs that are incorporated in the
global learning and development offer.

Telefonica, S.A. 266

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Within the framework of the Profile for Digital Transformation, we have also worked on developing
transformative and digital skills with executives and managers with high potential during the last quarter
of the year. In collaboration with one of the leading digital education institutions, we organized the
Digital Development Festival where more than 1,100 hours of online training were given and where we
were able to gain insight into the view of renowned internal and external experts on digitalization and its
impact on Telefonica's business through a series of on-site and online conferences that were attended by
more than 1,600 Company leaders.

Employee training

In 2016 the new training model was implemented throughout the Company with a new process and tool
that brings together all possibilities available to both employees and managers to be able to manage the
organization's training activities.

Training is divided into the Local Offer, whereby the various local entities of the Company identify,
manage and plan training activities, and the Global Offer, the purpose of which is to disseminate
knowledge and skills on strategy, the action principles, and our Company's values. In addition, the offer
available to employees has multiplied with a series of platforms in the Telefonica Group, such as
DatAcademy, Lear4Sales and Miriadax, where professionals have access to more continuous training
opportunities for their own development.

Almost one million courses (930,000) were given within the framework of the new training platform
(SuccessFactors), which represented the management of 2.5 million hours. The Global Offer represented
340,000 hours of training, with the main training actions focused on the action principles, criminal
liability, language programs, mobile telecommunications and society. The Local Offer represented
2,160,000 hours of training, which were managed by the Company's various business units according to
their training plans relating to local business targets.

Another one of the elements of the Company's training is the Social Learning platform, which we have
developed through Jam, where we have a series of collaborative learning groups in which 12,000
members participate and that receives 56,000 visits. A learning group is formed by a set of micro-learning
resources plus the contributions made by the various users and experts.

Universitas Telefonica operates on two levels: on-site and online. The facilities at the Barcelona campus
provided on-site training for 1,915 people in the eight programs given in person, accumulating a total of
79,680 hours of training, with a rating of 4.7 out of 5; and in operations, the Telefonica On the Road
program provided local training to 1,864 executives and middle managers, whereby professors from
Universitas traveled to various countries in Latin America and Europe, obtaining a rating of 4.6 out of 5. In
all cases it was achieved through programs focused on leadership and strategy transformation. In 2016
Universitas also began providing local training to partners of strategic alliances, such as Megafon in
Russia, with a rating of 4.6 out of 5.

For the Company, managing knowledge is a priority. Therefore, in 2016 the total cost of training for the
Group amounted to 40 million euros.

Occupational health and safety

One of Telefénica's priorities is to offer its staff the best possible working conditions at their place of work
or when they are on the move.

As per its Business Principles, Telefonica ensures staff work in a safe environment. Appropriate
mechanisms are therefore in place to avoid workplace accidents, injuries and illness associated with
professional activities by fully complying with prevailing regulations, implementing safe working
procedures, providing training and managing occupational risks.

Telefonica, S.A. 267

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

The Occupational Risk Management System ensures worker health and safety is at the heart of all
Telefonica's processes and services; offering an end-to-end model for rolling out joint action, procedures
and policies. This system enables Telefénica to identify and disseminate practices that are proven to
have an impact on staff welfare and therefore on reducing accident rates.

Managing diversity
Telefonica understands that managing diversity is key leverage for the Company's digitalization.

Diversity is seen as an opportunity, a competitive element which, through our diverse professionals,
allows us to reach out to our customers who are equally diverse. We are convinced of their capacity to
generate value, their commercial impact, and their impact on innovation and, in short, on our results.

In response to this vision, in 2016 significant momentum was provided by the creation of the Global
Diversity Council, which started up on March 17 and is composed of members of the management
committees for operations. The purpose of the Diversity Council is to support the initiatives being
developed locally and, based on this idea, a company plan was drafted that provides support and
monitors the countries in order to ensure they are making progress towards the targets set. The Council
also serves as a space to share good practices and to be able to replicate those initiatives that are working
well in other countries.

Accordingly, it is important to highlight the approval on April 26 by the Executive Committee of the
Company's Policy on Appointments and Termination of Executives, which strengthens the existing policy
by guaranteeing the cap company has the best talent through meritocracy, diversity and transparency.

With regard to the total headcount, the number of employees of Telefonica at December 31, 2016 was
127,323. There were 47,933 female employees (37.6% of the total), and 79,390 male employees (62.4%
of the total). 20.5% of executive positions are held by women.

It should also be noted that Telefénica employs professionals from more than 24 countries (four of which
are represented on the Board of Directors), representing over 100 nationalities.

Telefonica considers the diversity project to be a strategic project that is part of its Responsible Business
Plan, which is presented at the Committee on Institutional Affairs chaired by Julio Linares and which
reports to the Board. Within the scope of the Diversity Council, a Global Diversity Policy was developed in
2016.

Also noteworthy of mention is the career acceleration program for women (Women in Leadership)
developed last year, in which 150 professional women of the Group participated in 2016.

Since 25 November, 2015, Telefonica S.A. has used a specific and verifiable Female Director Selection
Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, which is aimed at ensuring that Director appointment or re-
election proposals meet the Board's requirements as set out in a preliminary analysis, encouraging
gender equality and diversity of knowledge and experience.

With regards to the promotion of Female Directors’ presence in the Board of Directors, it is important to
note that the policy expressly states that it is mandatory for Director selection procedures to encourage
gender diversity, and forbids any type of underlying bias which might cause any form of discrimination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee
and the Board of Directors of the Company have taken into account this premise in all their appointment
proposals, re-elections and ratifications of the directors that were presented, analyzed and approved
during this year 2016, and specifically the appointment proposal of Ms. Sabina Fluxa Thienemann,
approved by the General Ordinary Shareholders Meeting held on May 12, 2016.

Environment

Environmental policy, control of environmental risks and climate change

Telefonica has a global Environmental Strategy that arises from the Environmental Policy and Energy
Policy approved by the Board of Directors which sets out the road map for the Company to advance
towards a green economy, reducing the environmental impact of its facilities at the same time as
developing the potential for digital services to reduce the environmental footprint of other sectors.

Currently more than 80% of the company has Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in accordance
with Regulation ISO 14001, certified by an external body, which contribute to the proper management of
its environmental aspects and to extending a culture of environmental responsibility across the whole
supply chain. Telefénica has set itself the target of certifying 100% of operators under ISO 14001 by
2017.

Telefonica’s environmental risks and climate change are controlled and managed under the Company's
global risk model. The environmental aspects of the telecommunications operations are mainly focused
on the risk of high geographical dispersion and energy consumption, which is controlled by means of
environmental management based on uniform processes and a global energy efficiency programme.

Telefonica has a global environmental team made up of experts in environmental and energy
management in each of the Group's companies.

We would like to emphasize the following news from the past year:
e We approved a Policy for sustainable energy use at a corporate level.

e We announced our energy and climate change goals for the 2015-2020 period as part of our plan
to contribute to the Paris Agreement.

e We received ISO 50001 certification regarding energy management systems for our operations
in Spain and Germany.

e We launched a plan for renewable energy.

e We brought the Eco Rating initiative to Latin America, a seal that communicates to our
customers the environmental and social impact of mobile phones.

e For the third year in a row, we were included on the “A-List” for the Carbon Disclosure Project,
the largest index for investment in climate change. We are one of the nine telcos to appear in this
global ranking.

e¢ We made progress in measuring the positive impact that our digital services have regarding
adapting to and mitigating climate change.

e We received ISO 14001 certification for Telefonica Brazil and our Telxius submarine cable
infrastructure in America.

A Responsible Network

It is in our Network that we see the greatest environmental impact due to energy consumption, but also
with physical elements, such as visual impact or waste. To implement and maintain the responsible
Network, we apply the best practices available and we manage all environmental aspects of this from
design to decommissioning.

Environmental legislation, which is abundant in almost all of the countries where Telefonica operates,
applies mainly to our network infrastructures. Among these, it is worth mentioning the need to obtain

Telefonica, S.A. 270


--- Page 84 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

environmental permits, waste management, noise control and measuring electromagnetic fields.
Telefonica has common standards for all of its companies, in harmony with the principle of caution,
establishes minimum guidelines for environmental management with the aim of minimizing the impact
of infrastructures, these standards go beyond existing legislation. Also, these standards extend to all of
our suppliers and contractors.

Among the activities undertaken by the Group to manage the environmental aspects of its operations is
the sharing, whenever possible, of our facilities’ locations with other operators or communication tower
management companies. This leads to a lesser visual and energy impact and a reduction in waste
creation.

Main lines of action

Within the Responsible Business Strategic Plan, the company has established lines of action regarding
the environment. This plan is also grounded in each county in order to be able to focus on the most
relevant aspects at a local level. Some of the lines of action are:

e Energy and climate change: by means of the Corporate Climate Change Office, the Company
promotes energy efficiency and the reduction of Telefénica's carbon footprint with a plan for
100% of our electricity use to come from renewable sources in 2030. The year 2016 saw the
launch of the Company's new goals regarding these topics. Between 2010 and 2015, we
conducted 257 initiatives with which we managed to save 492 GWh, the equivalent energy
consumption of 40,300 homes in one year, and 64 million euros in our annual electricity bill. In
this way, we avoided the emission of more than 142 kT CO2 equivalents. Because of all this, in
2016 Telefonica was awarded the GSMA 2016 Green Mobile Award.

e = Circular economy: the Company is committed to promoting a circular economy, in which goods
used are returned to the value chain. Thus, waste and used devices from Telefénica networks
and customers, with a particular focus on electrical and electronic devices, are managed by
authorized entities, in compliance with environmental legislation and prioritizing management in
the following order: reduce, reuse, recycle. All companies in the group have waste management
programmes and recycling and/or reuse initiatives for managing customers’ devices.

e Green Services: in the current context where environmental challenges affect the whole of
society, Telefonica is developing services based on the ‘Internet of Things’ (loT), Cloud
Computing and Big Data to reduce the consumption of resources and the environmental impact
of our customers. These will be key in the area of reduction of and adaptation to climate change.
We align our business and environmental strategy, looking for opportunities linked to the search
for solutions to deal with environmental questions. We want to position ourselves as a key actor
in the green economy and, thus, sustainable innovation is essential.

These actions have allowed Telefonica to extend its environmental responsibility to residential and
business customers and to continuously respond to the demands of responsible environmental
management from investors and shareholders.

Telefonica, S.A. 271

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Human rights

In our risk management and analysis process, human rights and the impact that our activities, whether
directly or indirectly, may have on said rights, are taken into consideration in an inclusive and cross-
departmental manner. In line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,
we regularly perform an impact analysis in relation to our activities with the goal of identifying areas
where we must work with particular diligence to safeguard those rights.

In this impact analysis, we identify the areas of our activity (internal management, supply chain
management, operations, client services) and the rights that could potentially be affected, with the
purpose of carrying out preventative management in those fields. The growing importance of technology
and information and communication services in society, the development of new data-based services,
and new activities that Telefonica has undertaken (i.e. television), have led us to expand our analysis, and
require that we remain aware, not only of our traditional activities such as management of our human
resources and our supply chain, but also of aspects of growing concern to society such as the right to
privacy, the right to freedom of speech, or rights related to access to telecommunications services and
the environmental impact of our activity.

Respect for human rights is a key element in our Responsible Business Principles and our Supply Chain
Sustainability Policy. We are aware of the role that information and communication technologies can
play in promoting and respecting human rights and the responsibility we must take on to minimise the
negative impact and highlight our positive impact.

We have implemented the necessary processes to raise and manage company risks on this matter and
we provide various communication channels (employee reporting channel, supplier channel, Responsible
Business channel) to our stakeholders to enable them to confidentially and anonymously communicate
or report situations that entail a violation of human rights or that could result in a lack of respect for the
rights of people or the communities in which we operate.

Telefonica, S.A. 272

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Risk factors associated with the issuer

The Telefonica Group's business is affected by a series of intrinsic risk factors that affect exclusively the
Group, as well as a series of external factors that are common to businesses of the same sector. The main
risks and uncertainties facing the Company which could affect its business, financial position, reputation,
corporate image and brand and its results of operations, must be considered jointly with the information
in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and are as follows:

Group-Related Risks

Worsening of the economic and political environment could negatively affect Telefénica's
business.

Telefonica's international presence enables the diversification of its activities across countries and
regions, but it exposes Telefénica to various legislation, as well as to the political and economic
environments of the countries in which it operates. Any adverse developments or even uncertainties in
this regard, including exchange-rate or sovereign-risk fluctuations, may adversely affect the Company's
business, financial position, cash flows and results of operations and/or the performance of some or all of
the Group's financial indicators.

Economic conditions may adversely affect the level of demand of existing and prospective customers, as
they may no longer deem critical the services offered by the Group.

Growth in Europe and financial stability may be affected by political uncertainty in some European
countries due to upcoming general elections, a possible revival of the crisis in Greece, restructuring of the
banking sector and due to the impact of steps taken towards an EU banking union and a capital markets
union. In particular, the British exit process from the European Union following the vote to leave in the
recent referendum, will require an adjustment of the economy to whatever new trade and investment
relationships are put in place in the future, with the consequences in the meantime being uncertainty
regarding investment, activity and financial market volatility. In 2016, the Telefonica Group obtained
24.5% of its revenues in Spain (22.6% in 2015), 14.4% in Germany (the same percentage as in 2015) and
13.2% in United Kingdom (14.3% in 2015).

In Latin America, there is an increasing exchange rate risk brought on by external factors such as
increasing interest rates in the United States amid still low commodity prices and doubts about growth
and imbalances in China; as well as internal factors as a consequence of the still high fiscal and external
deficits in the most important Latin American countries or the low liquidity in exchange markets as it is
the case in Argentina.

Some of the most significant macroeconomic risk factors in the region affect Mexico, as it is the country
with the highest commercial and financial exposure to the United States. In this sense, increasing interest
rates and the possible overhaul of trade agreements between both countries could imply higher
restrictions on imports into the United States that would affect negatively the economic activity in
Mexico.

Brazil is undertaking several measures principally focused on adjusting its public finances. A
constitutional amendment limiting public spending has been approved and the government has
submitted a new social security reform bill to Congress. However, the possibility of a new bout of political
turmoil, which could weaken the support of the reforms, is not negligible. While signs of stabilization have
emerged, economic growth continues to be negative and the unemployment rate has hit double digits,
having a sizable effect on consumption spending. Moreover, despite financing external needs have
decreased, internal needs are still high. All these elements have led to new downgrades to the country’s
credit rating during 2016, which now is below investment grade.

Telefonica, S.A. 273


--- Page 87 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

In countries such as Chile, Colombia and Peru, the recent uptick in commodity prices is having a positive
impact on its fiscal and external accounts, but growth continues to be below its potential level due to the
lower external inflows, which have affected investment and, to a lower extent, consumption.

In Argentina, the new government is focused on resolving Argentina's macroeconomic and financial
imbalances and on recovering international confidence. Although reforms taking place may have positive
effects in the medium term, short term risks persist, including exchange rate risk, especially due to the
high inflation rate amid an economic contraction.

During 2016, Telefonica Hispanoamérica represented 24.2% of the Telefonica Group's revenues (26.2%
in 2015), of which 23.8% proceeded from revenues in Argentina, 19.9% in Peru and 17.2% in Chile.
During 2016, Telefonica Brazil represented 21.3% of the Telefénica's Group revenues (20.1% in 2015). In
this respect, approximately 30.4% of the Group's revenues were generated in countries that do not have
investment grade status (in order of importance, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Venezuela,
Guatemala, Costa Rica and El Salvador), and other countries are only one notch away from losing this
threshold.

“Country risk” factors include the following, among others:

¢ umexpected adverse changes in regulation or administrative policies, including changes that
modify the terms and conditions of licenses and concessions and their renewal (or delay their
approval);

e abrupt exchange rate movements;
e high inflation rates;

¢ expropriation or nationalization of assets, adverse tax decisions, or other forms of state
intervention;

¢ —economic-financial downturns, political instability and civil disturbances; and

¢ maximum limits on profit margins imposed in order to limit the prices of goods and services
through the analysis of cost structures (for example, in Venezuela, a maximum profit margin has
been introduced that is set annually by the Superintendence for Defense of Socioeconomic
Rights).

Any of the foregoing may adversely affect the business, financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the Group.

The Group's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if it does not
effectively manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.

At December 31, 2016, 50.8% of the Group's net debt (in nominal terms) was pegged to fixed interest
rates for over a year, while 20% was denominated in a currency other than the euro. At December 31,
2016, the net financial debt ratio in Latin American currencies was 13%.

To illustrate the sensitivity of financial expenses to a change in short-term interest rates at December 31,
2016: (i) a 100 basis points increase in interest rates in all currencies in which Telefonica has a financial
position at that date would lead to an increase in financial expenses of 232 million euros for the year
ended December 31, 2016, (ii) whereas a 100 basis points decrease in interest rates in all currencies
(even if negative interest rates are reached), would lead to a reduction in financial expenses of 201 million
euros for the year ended December 31, 2016. These calculations were made assuming a constant
currency and balance position equivalent to the position at year end taking into account the derivative
financial instruments arranged.

Telefonica, S.A. 274


--- Page 88 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

According to the Group's calculations, the impact on results arising from a 10% depreciation of Latin
American currencies against the US dollar and a 10% depreciation of other global currencies against the
euro, excluding the pound sterling, would result in exchange losses of 43 million euros for the year ended
December 31, 2016, primarily due to the depreciation of the Venezuelan bolivar and, to a lesser extent,
the Argentinean peso. These calculations were made assuming a constant currency financial position
with an impact on profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, including derivative instruments
in place.

During 2016, Telefénica Brazil represented 24.6% (27.0% in 2015), Telefénica Hispanoamérica
represented 23.0% (32.9% in 2015) and Telefonica United Kingdom represented 11.3% (14.6% in 2015)
of the operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) of the Telefonica Group.

The Telefonica Group uses a variety of strategies to manage this risk, among others the use of financial
derivatives, which themselves are also exposed to risk, including counterparty risk. However, the Group's
risk management strategies may not achieve the desired effect, which could adversely affect the Group's
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Existing or worsening conditions in the financial markets may limit the Group's ability to finance,
and consequently, the ability to carry out its business plan.

The performance, expansion and improvement of the Telefonica Group's networks, the development and
distribution of the Telefonica Group's services and products, the implementation of Telefonica's strategic
plan and new technologies, the renewal of licenses or the expansion of the Telefonica Group's business in
countries where it operates, may require a substantial amount of financing.

A decrease in the liquidity of Telefonica, a difficulty in refinancing maturing debt or raising new funds as
debt or equity could force Telefonica to use resources allocated to investments or other commitments to
pay its financial debt, which could have a negative effect on the Group's business, financial condition,
results of operations and/or cash flows.

Funding could be more difficult and costly in the event of a significant deterioration of conditions in the
international or local financial markets due to the uncertainties regarding the hikes in interest rates on
the part of the US Federal Reserve and the oil prices instabilities, or if there is an eventual deterioration in
the solvency or operating performance of Telefénica.

At December 31, 2016, gross financial debt scheduled to mature in 2017 amounted to 13,326 million
euros (which includes the net position of derivative financial instruments and certain current payables),
and gross financial debt scheduled to mature in 2018 amounted to 7,195 million euros.

In accordance with its liquidity policy, Telefonica has covered its gross debt maturities over the next
twelve months with cash and credit lines available at December 31, 2016. Telefénica's liquidity could be
affected if market conditions make it difficult to renew existing undrawn credit lines, 8% of which, at
December 31, 2016, were scheduled to mature prior to December 31, 2017.

In addition, given the interrelation between economic growth and financial stability, the materialization of
any of the economic, political and exchange rate risks referred to above could lead to a negative impact
on the availability and cost of Telefénica's financing and its liquidity strategy, which could have a
negative effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.

Adoption of new accounting standards could affect reported results and financial position.

Accounting Standardization Bodies and other authorities may periodically change accounting regulations
that govern the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements. Those changes could have
a significant impact on the way the Group accounts and presents its financial position and its operating
income. In some instances, a modified standard or a new requirement with retroactive nature must be
implemented, which requires the Group to restate previous financial statements.

Telefonica, S.A. 275


--- Page 89 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

See details of the implementation of new standards and interpretations issued in Note 3 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. In particular, Telefonica is required to adopt the new accounting
standards IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective from January 1, 2018, and IFRS 16
Leases, effective for the financial years from January 1, 2019. These standards present significant
changes that could affect both the amount and moment of recognition of revenues and expenses related
with certain sales transactions, as well as the accounting treatment for all lease contracts (other than
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets). These changes could have a material impact on the
Group's financial statements. Such impact is under analysis as of the date of this document.

Risks relating to the Group's Industry

The Group operates in a highly regulated industry which requires government concessions for the
provision of a large part of its services and the use of spectrum, which is a scarce and costly
resource.

The telecommunications sector is subject to laws and sector-specific regulations in the majority of the
countries where the Group provides its services. Additionally, many of the services the Group provides
require the granting of a license, concession or official approval, which usually requires certain obligations
and investments to be made, such as those relating to the acquisition of spectrum. Among the main risks
of this nature are those related to spectrum regulation and licenses/concessions, rates, universal service
regulation, regulated wholesale services over fiber networks, privacy, functional separation of businesses
and network neutrality. The fact that the Group's business is highly regulated both affects its revenues
and imposes costs on its operations.

Thus, as the Group provides most of its services under licenses, authorizations or concessions, it is
vulnerable to administrative bodies' decisions, such as economic fines for serious breaches in the
provision of services and, potentially, revocation or failure to renew these licenses, authorizations or
concessions, or the granting of new licenses to competitors for the provisions of services in a specific
market.

In this regard, the Telefonica Group pursues its license renewals on the terms referred in their respective
contractual conditions, though it cannot guarantee that it will always complete this process successfully
or under the most beneficial terms for the Group. In many cases complying with certain obligations is
required, including, among others, minimum specified quality, service and coverage standards and capital
investment. Failure to comply with these obligations could result in the imposition of fines, revision of the
contractual terms, or even the revocation of the license, authorization or concession.

Additionally, the Telefonica Group could be affected by regulatory actions carried out by the antitrust
authorities. These authorities could prohibit certain actions, such as new acquisitions or specific
practices, create obligations or lead to heavy fines. Any such measures implemented by the competition
authorities could result in economic and/or reputational loss for the Group, in addition to a loss of market
share and/or harm to the future growth of certain businesses. Regarding the merger of Telefonica
Deutschland Holding AG and E-Plus, other providers such as United Internet and the regional cable
operator Airdata lodged an appeal before the General Court against the decision of the EU which
authorized such merger. Telefonica Deutschland has been accepted as an interested party of the process
and it has presented its statements in both cases. United Internet has lodged a second appeal against the
EC in relation to the content of the letter of commitment assumed by Telefonica Deutschland regarding
the implementation of remedies for non-network operators. In December 2016, each of Mass Response
Service GmbH and Multiconnect GmbH filed an appeal before the General Court against the decision of
the EU that Telefonica Deutschland is not obliged to grant access to Full-Mobile Virtual Network
Operators (“MVNO”) under the non-MNO remedy of the commitments. Telefonica Deutschland will apply
for leave to intervene as an interested party.

Regulation of spectrum and access to new government licenses/concessions of spectrum

On September 14, 2016, the EC adopted, among other texts, a proposed Directive for the establishment
of a European Electronic Communication Code, which could have significant implications, inter alia, for
access to networks, spectrum use, auction conditions, duration and renewal of licenses, universal service,
consumer protection, audiovisual services and platforms. It is estimated that the approval of such
regulatory framework will take place in a year and a half.

On December 14, 2016, the European Parliament and Council agreed on a decision regarding the use and
availability of the 700 MHz band. This could require new cash outflows from Telefénica between 2017
and 2022 in both the United Kingdom and Spain, where it is expected that the 700 MHz band will be
available between 2020-2022. In connection with spectrum auctions for 2.3 and 3.4 GHz band, in the
United Kingdom, Ofcom issued a consultation document on November 21, 2016. Responses were due by
January 30, 2017, and a decision is expected in the second quarter of 2017. In Germany, the regulatory
agency for electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway (“BNetzA”) initiated a proceeding for
the demand-oriented allocation of new frequencies for the further rollout of digital 5G infrastructures,
which include the timely allocation of the 2 GHz spectrum expiring at the end of 2020 and 2025 (so called
UMTS spectrum) and further spectrum (inter alia 3.5 GHz). A decision about the allocation procedure is
expected towards the end of 2017 and an auction may take place in 2018 or 2019.

In Latin America, spectrum auctions are expected to take place requiring potential cash outflows to
obtain additional spectrum or to meet the coverage requirements associated with these licenses.
Specifically, the procedures expected to take place in 2017-2018, in the relevant jurisdiction for the
Group, are:

e Mexico: An auction spectrum in the 2500 MHz band is expected to take place between the third
quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2018. A wholesale network tender, which will offer
services in the 700 MHz band was concluded on November 17, 2016. Altan was the tender
winner and the commercial operations must begin no later than March 31, 2018.

¢ Colombia: During 2017 the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications published
for commentaries until March 7, 2017 the project of resolution with the conditions for an auction
of 70 MHz of spectrum band in 700 MHz and 5 MHz in 1900 MHz. In addition, the Ministry
published a project of decree increasing the spectrum cap for lower bands to 45 MHz and 90 MHz
for upper bands. The schedule for the auction has not been set yet.

e Argentina: The Government instructed the regulatory authority to issue new regulations during
2017 to ensure the reassignment of frequencies of the radio spectrum for the provision of
wireless or fixed wireless services and enables the reassignment of frequencies previously
granted to other provider.

However, it is likely that some of these spectrum tender procedures will not be completed, or even
initiated in the mentioned dates. In addition to the above, it may be the case that certain administrations
may not yet have announced their intention to release new spectrum but may do so during 2017. The
above does not include processes announced via general statements by administrations, which involve
bands not key to Telefonica’s needs. Furthermore, Telefonica may also seek to acquire spectrum on the
secondary market where opportunities might arise.

Risks relating to concessions and licenses previously granted

The terms of concessions and licenses granted to the Group and necessary for the provision of its
services may be challenged or amended by the regulators at any time, which may materially adversely
affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The German regulator initiated consultations in March and July 2016 on the frequency distribution after
the merger between Telefonica Deutschland and E-Plus, particularly in the 2 GHz band and on the future

Telefonica, S.A. 277


--- Page 91 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

spectrum allocation for 5G band. The result of such consultations could lead, among others, to proposals
by the regulator reorganizing the spectrum that Telefonica Deutschland holds on the 2 GHz band.

In the United Kingdom, Telefénica has an obligation in its 800 MHz spectrum license to provide indoor
coverage to 98% of the United Kingdom population (and 95% of the population of each of England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) and an obligation in its 900/1800 MHz spectrum license to provide
voice and text services to 90% of the United Kingdom landmass, both by the end of 2017, to be
maintained, thereafter. Inherent with these obligations is a risk of Telefonica United Kingdom not
meeting the required targets. Telefonica United Kingdom is actively working towards mitigating the risk
through the continuous investment in an infrastructure improvement program, upgrading its 2G and 3G
Networks and continued roll-out of its 4G Network.

In the state of Sao Paulo, Telefénica Brazil provides local and national long-distance Fixed Switched
Telephony Service ("STFC") under the so-called public regime, through a concession agreement, which is
expected to remain in force until 2025. In accordance with current regulations, Telefénica Brasil informed
the Brazilian regulatory authority (Agencia Nacional de Telecomunicagoes or "ANATEL") that the net
value, as of December 31, 2015, of assets assigned to the provision of STFC (which include, among
others, switching and transmission equipment and public use terminals, external network equipment,
energy equipment and system and operation support equipment) were estimated to total 7.8 billion
Brazilian reais. At December 31, 2016, this value is estimated to total 8,813,916 Brazilian reais (this value
will be updated in the second half of 2017). In principle, the assets assigned to the provision of STFC were
considered reversible assets. During the last months, a bill amending the regulatory framework in Brazil
has been processed, establishing, among others, that such assets will no longer be reversible under the
new licenses regime in exchange for significant broadband investment commitments. Recently, the
processing at the Senate of such bill has been challenged before the Federal Supreme Court. Such Court
and, consequently, the Senate’s governing board has decided to send the bill for voting in the plenary.
With the bill being sent to the plenary, it could be understood that there is no more dispute for the
Supreme Court to decide upon. In case that the bill is finally approved, ANATEL will be entitled to adopt
the pertinent administrative decisions for the transformation of the respective licenses with the
consequent modification of the future binding obligations to STFC providers.

In Colombia, the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications (“ITC”) issued Resolution
597 on March 27, 2014, to renew 850 MHz/1900 MHz licenses for 10 additional years. However, the
reversion of assets (other than radio frequencies, which it is clear that must be returned) and its scope
was widely discussed between the relevant mobile operators (including Telefonica Colombia) and the ITC
in the context of the liquidation of the previous concession contract, taking into consideration the terms
of the contract, and the Constitutional Court's interpretation of Law 422 of 1998 and Law 1341 of 2009.
Discussions on the matter concluded on February 16, 2016, when the ITC convened an arbitration
proceeding, in accordance with in the terms of the relevant concession contract. The relevant concession
holders (including Telefénica Colombia) filed a response to the claim prompted by the ITC. The arbitration
process is still ongoing.

In Peru, Telefonica has concessions for the provision of the fixed-line service until November 2027. In
December 2013, Telefénica filed a partial renewal request for these concessions for five more years. In
December 2014 and June 2016, Telefonica also filed a renewal request for twenty more years in relation
to a concession for the provision of local carrier service and one of the concessions to provide mobile-line
services in provinces, respectively. As of the date of this document, the decision of the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (Ministerio de Transportes y Comunicaciones) in all such proceedings is
still pending and according to the legislation, the concessions subject of these procedures remain in force
as long as the procedures are in progress.

Telefonica Méviles Chile, S.A. was awarded 2x10 MHz spectrum on the 700 MHz band in March 2014. A
claim was brought by a consumer organization against the 700 MHz assignments. The decision by the
Supreme Court on the appeal presented by such consumer organization is still pending.

Telefonica, S.A. 278

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Group's consolidated investment in spectrum acquisitions
and renewals amounted to 345 million euros.

The Group's failure to obtain sufficient or appropriate spectrum capacity in the jurisdictions discussed
above or any others in which it operates, or its inability to assume the related costs, could have an
adverse impact on its ability to launch and provide new services and on Telefonica's ability to maintain
the quality of existing services, which may adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

Regulation of wholesale and retail charges

The European Regulation 2015/2120 on Net Neutrality and Roaming was adopted on November 25,
2015. From June 15, 2017, operators may not charge roaming users within the EU an additional fee on
their domestic prices for roaming calls, SMS and data services. However, in some circumstances,
operators may apply consumption limits and additional surcharge under a “fair use policy”. In January
2017, wholesale roaming caps have been agreed between the Council and the Parliament and the
maximum wholesale caps have been set at the following limits: 0.01€/sms; 0.032€/minute; data services
glide path: 7.7€/GB (June — December 2017); 6€/GB (2018); 4.5€/GB (2019); 3.5€/GB (2020); 3€/GB
(2021) and 2.5€/GB (2022).

On September 14, 2016, the EC presented its proposal of the regulatory framework which, among other
measures, intends to incorporate a European methodology and a European upper limit for the call-
termination prices for landline phone/ mobile phone applicable in EU.

The decreases in wholesale mobile termination rates (“MTR”) in Europe are also noteworthy. In the
United Kingdom, the current rate is 0.503 ppm. A further cut to 0.495 ppm will come into effect from April
1,2017.

In Germany, on August 30, 2016, BNetzA adopted a regulatory decision, which considers with pure long
run incremental cost (“LRIC") a new cost model for the calculation of MTR. Telefénica Deutschland has
appealed the decision in court, but the appeal has not yet been decided. BNetzA approved new MTR on
November 30, 2016, in a provisional decision, which sets the rates to 0.011 euro/minute as of December
1, 2016, to 0.0107 euro/minute as of December 1, 2017, and to 0.0095 euro/minute as of December 1,
2018, until the end of November 2019. Before taking a final decision, the new MTR are nationally
consulted and notified to the EC. There is consequently a risk that when the new MTR are approved
(which will be retroactively enforceable from December 1, 2016), and with the new termination rates
applicable from January 1, 2017, the rates will significantly decrease. Regarding fixed networks
termination rates, BNetzA adopted at the end of January 2017 a provisional decision which establish a
tariff of 0.0010 euro/minute.

In Spain, on July 1, 2016, the Spanish National Regulatory and Competition Authority (Comisién Nacional
de los Mercados y la Competencia or "CNMC") initiated the process of reviewing the prices of mobile
termination, with a final decision expected to be adopted during 2017.

Additionally, on January 17, 2017, the CNMC issued the analysis of the market for access and call
origination on fixed networks. The CNMC maintains the obligation of Telefénica, as an operator with
significant market power, to provide a wholesale interconnection offer and a wholesale line rental
("WLR"), both with cost-oriented prices regarding manufacturing costs and the adoption of a
management accounting system. Telefénica is equally obliged to non-discrimination, transparency and
separation of accounts. In Latin America, it is likely that MTRs will also be reduced in the short to medium
term.

In Brazil, ANATEL has issued ex-ante regulations to ensure competition in the wholesale market, which
includes reductions of the MTR. In this regard, the Plano Geral de Metas de Competicdo (“PGMC"),
amended by Resolution 649/2015, established that mobile termination fees are subject to successive

Telefonica, S.A. 279


--- Page 93 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

yearly reductions from 2016 until 2019, when the definitive cost-oriented-model fees are expected to be
in force (such Resolution has been challenged in courts without a definitive outcome). On December 5,
2016, ANATEL issued a public consultation for the revision of the PGMC, which addresses changes in the
relevant wholesale markets regulated by the PGMC and also in the cost-oriented model. The mentioned
public consultation is available for comments until March 22, 2017.

In Mexico, on September 23, 2016, the Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (“IFT”) announced that
the MTRs applicable to operators different from the so-called Prevailing Economic Agent for 2017 will be
0.1906 pesos per minute, as long as the regulatory asymmetry of the Prevailing Economic Agent
introduced by Mexico with the constitutional reform on 2014 and the new Federal Telecommunication
Law on 2014 remains in effect.

In Colombia, the Comisién de Regulacién de Comunicaciones (“CRC”) published a regulatory project for
public comments in November 2016. In the project the CRC proposes a symmetric termination rate of
11.17 COP per minute and 4.3 million COP per monthly capacity from 2017 for established operators and
an asymmetric termination rate of 19.01 COP per minute and 7.6 million COP per monthly capacity for
challenger operators in a five-year period. The CRC also proposes regulatory measures to promote the
entry of mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”), including the regulation of prices for the access to
the mobile networks. The project is still in debate.

In Peru, the Organismo Supervisor de las Telecomunicaciones (“OSIPTEL”) started the process for the
revision of the values on charges of interconnection for mobile termination of calls in telecommunication
services networks in November 2016 .The new values established by OSIPTEL will apply as of the fourth
quarter of 2017.

As a result of the foregoing regulatory actions, Telefonica may receive lower prices for certain of its
services, which may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

Regulation of Universal Services

The Universal Service (“US”) is an economic and legal term which refers to the obligation imposed to
telecommunication operators to provide a basic service to all inhabitants of a country. In general, the goal
is to promote quality services availability at affordable, reasonable and fair prices, to increase the access
to advances telecommunication services (such as broadband) and to move forward with the availability
of such services to all customers. On its reform proposal for the regulatory framework issued on
September 14, 2016, the EC seeks to modernize the Universal Services area in Europe, removing the
mandatory inclusion of the traditional services (telephone boxes, directories and information services)
and focusing on the provision of affordable broadband services. The EC also proposed that the US must
be funded from general budgets and not from sectorial budgets. However, if this funding method does
not thrive, the affordable broadband inclusion could result more expensive for the sector. In any case, it is
estimated that the new regulation will not be applicable before 2020.

In Spain, the licenses of Telefénica de Espafia and Telefonica Telecomunicaciones Publicas for the
provision of USs expired on December 31, 2016. Both companies have been designated for the provision
of these services from January 1, 2017.

In Brazil, on December 15, 2016, a proposal of the General Plan for Universalisation of Fixed Switched
Telephony Services (“PGMU") was approved by ANATEL.

The imposition on the Telefonica Group of additional or more onerous obligations to provide US services
in the jurisdictions where it operates could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Telefonica, S.A. 280

Regulation of fiber networks

On February 24, 2016, the Spanish CNMC adopted a final resolution on the wholesale broadband market
regulation, which raises a geographical segmentation in competitive (66 cities, 34% of total population)
and non-competitive areas. It is anticipated that this resolution will last for at least four years. Its
implementation is expected to result in a moderate increase of the current regulatory obligations of
Telefonica in Spain, in terms of its granting of access to other operators to its fiber network and with
respect to certain aspects relating specifically to the business segment (high quality bitstream service for
business customers with national coverage). This Resolution has been appealed by Telefonica Espana.
Additionally, on January 18, 2016, the CNMC adopted a resolution which approves the reference offer of
the new wholesale unbundled virtual access service to Telefénica's new broadband Ethernet service (local
NEBA). The NEBA service should be operative in 12 months from the date of the resolution's adoption.

Any of such obligations and restrictions could raise costs and limit Telefénica's freedom to provide the
mentioned services, which could materially adversely affect Telefonica's business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

Regulations on privacy

An intense data protection and privacy regulation may result in limitations to offer innovative digital
services such as Big Data services. In Europe the new General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") of
April 27, 2016, will be directly applicable in all member States from May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduces
administrative fines of up to 4% of an undertaking’s annual global turnover for breaching the new data
protection rules.

On January 10, 2017, the EC presented its proposal for a regulation on ePrivacy, which will replace the
current Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy in the electronic communications sector and will complement
the recently approved GDPR. The proposal also introduces administrative fines of up to 4% of an
undertaking’s annual global turnover for breaching new regulations.

In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared invalid the decision of the EC as
regards the "Safe Harbor Agreement" relating to the transfer of personal data from the EU to the United
States. Subsequently, the EC adopted a new decision on Privacy Shield on July 12, 2016, which considers
that there is an adequate level of protection of personal data transferred from the EU to US self-certified
companies complying with the Privacy Shield principles. Telefénica USA, Inc. has self-certified itself as
Privacy Shield compliant. The Privacy Shield has been challenged before the EU's General Court by civil-
society groups, but the admission of their appeals is still pending.

In Brazil, the adoption of a Personal Data Protection Act is still pending, this could lead to further
obligations and restrictions for operators in relation to the collection of personal data and its treatment.

Any of such obligations and restrictions could raise costs and limit Telefonica's ability to provide certain
services, which could materially adversely affect Telefénica’s business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Regulation of network neutrality

Under the principle of network neutrality applicable to Internet access services area, network operators
could not establish technical or commercial restrictions regarding the terminals that can be connected or
the services, or applications and contents that can be accessed or distributed through the Internet by the
end user. It also refers to the non-discriminatory behaviour (e.g. non-anticompetitive) to be adopted by
operators regarding the different types of Internet traffic circulating through their networks.

In Europe, the application of the so-called “net neutrality Regulation” (Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of
November 25, 2015) will be monitored by national regulatory authorities following guidance to be
delivered by the European Regulatory Authority (“BEREC”) on August 30, 2016. This guidance could

Telefonica, S.A. 281


--- Page 95 ---

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

directly impact internet access service commercial practices (for example, some zero rating offers) and it
may limit network management practices or increase transparency requirements on the Internet Access
Service.

Telefonica operates in Latin American countries where net neutrality is being implemented, such as Chile,
Colombia, Mexico and Peru, where OSIPTEL adopted regulations aimed at providing clear guidelines on
the implementation of the net neutrality regime adopted in 2012 and in force since January 1, 2017. In
Brazil, the President approved a net neutrality decree (regulating Marco Civil) on May 11, 2016. In Mexico,
the IFT scheduled a public consultation to be carried out in August 2016 in respect of the guidelines that
will be issued regarding net neutrality, which was postponed to the first quarter 2017. In Chile, on
November 22, 2016, the Commission of Telecommunications submitted a bill for amending the Network
Neutrality Act. The main changes are the establishment of rules more restricted to apply measures for
traffic management and restrictive rules for “Zero Rating”. If changes to regulation such as those
described above, or otherwise, occur in the various jurisdictions where the Telefonica Group operates, it
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

The Telefénica Group is exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and
regulations and economic sanctions programs.

The Telefonica Group is required to comply with the laws and regulations of various jurisdictions where it
conducts operations. In particular, the Group's international operations are subject to various anti-
corruption laws, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery
Act of 2010, and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the United Nations, the
European Union and the United States, including the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets
Control. The anti-corruption laws generally prohibit providing anything of value to government officials
for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. As part
of the Telefonica Group's business, it may deal with entities, the employees of which are considered
government officials. In addition, economic sanctions programs restrict the Group's business dealings
with certain sanctioned countries, individuals and entities.

Although the Group has internal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable
anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies and
procedures will be sufficient or that the Group's employees, directors, officers, partners, agents and
service providers will not take actions in violation of the Group's policies and procedures (or otherwise in
violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations) for which the Group or they may
be ultimately held responsible. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations could lead to
financial penalties, exclusion from government contracts, damage to the Group's reputation and other
consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Telefonica is currently conducting internal investigations covering various countries regarding possible
violations of applicable anti-corruption laws. Telefénica has been in contact with governmental
authorities about these matters and intends to cooperate with those authorities as the investigations
continue. It is not possible at this time to predict the scope or duration of these matters or their likely
outcome.

Customers’ perceptions of services offered by the Company may put it at a disadvantage
compared to competitors' offerings.

Customers’ perceptions of the assistance and services offered are critical to operating in highly-
competitive markets. The ability to predict and respond to the changing needs and demands of
customers affects the Company's competitive position relative to other technology sector companies,
and its ability to extract the value generated during this process of transformation. Failure to do so

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

As of December 31, 2016, the Telefonica Group depended on three handset suppliers and 12 network
infrastructure suppliers, which together accounted for 80% of the awarded contracts for the year then
ended. These suppliers may, among other things, extend delivery times, raise prices and limit supply due
to their own stock shortfalls and business requirements.

If these suppliers fail to deliver products and services to the Telefonica Group on a timely basis, it could
jeopardize network deployment and expansion plans, which in some cases could adversely affect the
Telefonica Group's ability to satisfy its license terms and requirements, or otherwise have an adverse
effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Unanticipated network interruptions can lead to quality loss or the interruption of the service.

Unanticipated network interruptions as a result of system failures, including those due to network,
hardware or software, stealing of infrastructure elements or cyber-attacks, which affect the quality of or
cause an interruption in the Telefonica Group's service, could lead to customer dissatisfaction, reduced
revenues and traffic, costly repairs, penalties or other measures imposed by regulatory authorities and
could harm the Telefonica Group's image and reputation.

Telecommunications companies worldwide face increasing cybersecurity threats as businesses become
increasingly dependent on telecommunications and computer networks and adopt cloud computing
technologies. Cybersecurity threats include gaining unauthorized access to Telefénica's systems or
inserting computer viruses or malicious software in its systems to misappropriate consumer data and
other sensitive information, corrupt Telefénica's data or disrupt its operations. Unauthorized access may
also be gained through traditional means such as the theft of laptop computers, portable data devices
and mobile phones and intelligence gathering on employees with access.

Telefonica attempts to mitigate these risks through a number of measures, including backup systems
and protective systems such as firewalls, virus scanners and other physical and logical security. However,
these measures are not always effective. Although the Telefonica Group has insurance policies to cover
these types of incidents, and the claims and loss in revenue caused by service interruptions to date have
been covered by these policies, these policies may not be sufficient to cover all possible monetary losses.

The telecommunications industry may be affected by the possible effects that electromagnetic
fields, emitted by mobile devices and base stations, may have on human health.

In some countries, there is a concern regarding potential effects of electromagnetic fields, emitted by
mobile devices and base stations, on human health. This public concern has caused certain governments
and administrations to take measures that have hindered the deployment of the infrastructures
necessary to ensure quality of service, and affected the deployment criteria of new networks and digital
services such as smart meters development.

There is a consensus between certain expert groups and public health agencies, including the World
Health Organization that states that currently there are no established risks associated with exposure to
low frequency signals in mobile communications. However, the scientific community is still investigating
this issue especially with respect to mobile devices. Exposure limits for radio frequency suggested in the
guidelines of the Protection of Non-lonizing Radiation Protection Committee have been internationally
recognized. The mobile industry has adopted these exposure limits and works to request authorities
worldwide to adopt these standards.

Worries about radio frequency emissions may discourage the use of mobile devices and new digital
services, which could cause the public authorities to implement measures restricting where transmitters
and cell sites can be located, how they operate, the use of mobile telephones and the massive
deployment of smart meters and other products using mobile technology. This could lead to Telefonica
being unable to expand or improve its mobile network.

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

The adoption of new measures by governments or administrations or other regulatory interventions in
this respect, and any future assessment on the adverse impact of electromagnetic fields on health, may
adversely affect the business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows of the Telefonica
Group.

Possible regulatory, business, economic or poli

ical changes could lead to asset impairment.

The Telefonica Group reviews on an annual basis, or more frequently when the circumstances require it,
the value of assets and cash-generating units, to assess whether their carrying values can be supported
by the future expected cash flows, including, in some cases synergies allowed for in acquisition costs.
Potential changes in the regulatory, business, economic or political environment may result in the need
to introduce changes to estimates made and to recognize impairments in goodwill, intangible assets or
fixed assets. Although the recognition of impairments of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets
and financial assets results in a non-cash charge on the income statement, it could adversely affect the
results of the Telefonica Group's operations. In this respect, the Telefonica Group has experienced
impairments on certain of its investments, affecting its results of operations in the year in which they
were experienced. In 2016, impairment losses in goodwill were recognized amounting to 215 million
euros for Telefonica operations in Venezuela (124 million euros) and Mexico (91 million euros).

The Telefonica Group's networks carry and store large volumes of confidential, personal and
corporate data, and its Internet access and hosting services may lead to claims for illegal or illicit
use of the Internet.

The Telefénica Group's networks carry and store large volumes of confidential, personal and business
data, through both voice and data traffic. The Telefonica Group stores increasing quantities and types of
customer data in both business and consumer segments. Despite its best efforts to prevent it, the
Telefonica Group may be found liable for any loss, transfer, or inappropriate modification of the customer
data or general public data stored on its servers or transmitted through its networks, any of which could
involve many people and have an impact on the Group's reputation, or lead to legal claims and liabilities
that are difficult to measure in advance.

In addition, the Telefonica Group's Internet access and hosting servers could lead to claims for illegal or
unlawful use of the Internet. Telefénica, like other telecommunications providers, may be held liable for
any loss, transfer or inappropriate modification of the customer data stored on its servers or carried by its
networks.

In most countries in which the Telefonica Group operates, the provision of its Internet access and hosting
services (including the operation of websites with shelf-generated content) are regulated under a limited
liability regime applicable to the content that it makes available to the public as a technical service
provider, particularly content protected by copyright or similar laws. However, regulatory changes have
been introduced imposing additional obligations on access providers (such as blocking access to a
website) as part of the struggle against some illegal or illicit uses of the Internet, notably in Europe.

Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the Group.

Telefénica and Telefonica Group companies are party to lawsuits, tax claims, antitrust and other
legal proceedings.

Telefonica and Telefénica Group companies are party to lawsuits, tax claims, antitrust and other legal
proceedings in the ordinary course of their businesses, the financial outcome of which is unpredictable.
An adverse outcome or settlement in these or other proceedings could result in significant costs and may
have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations,
reputation and cash flows. In particular, the Telefonica Group is party to certain judicial tax proceedings in
Peru concerning the clearance of certain previous years’ income tax, in respect of which a contentious-
administrative appeal is currently pending and to certain tax proceedings in Brazil, primarily relating to

the ICMS (a Brazilian tax on telecommunication services) and to the Corporate Tax. Further details on
these matters are provided in Notes 17 and 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other information

Group companies with non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests in the Telefonica Group companies can be divided into two groups. Firstly,
subsidiaries listed in a regulated market: Telefénica Brasil and Telefonica Deutschland,
where minority shareholdings are widely dispersed and in respect of which Telefonica protects minority
interests by complying with the regulations of the related market. Secondly, subsidiaries with a main
minority shareholder, with whom agreements are entered into in order to guarantee the protection of
such shareholder's rights and, in certain cases (such as Colombia Telecomunicaciones) where there are
also specific commitments resulting from corporate transactions (see Note 21.b).

Average payment period of the Spanish companies

The Telefonica Group's Spanish companies have adapted their internal processes and payment schedules
to the provisions of Law 15/2010 (amended by Law 31/2014) and Royal Decree-Law 4/2013, amending
Law 3/2004, which establishes measures against late payment in commercial transactions. Engagement
conditions with commercial suppliers in 2016 included payment periods of up to 60 days, according to
the terms agreed between the parties.

For efficiency purposes, the Telefonica Group's companies in Spain have agreed payment schedules with
suppliers, whereby payments are made on set days of each month. Payments to Spanish suppliers in
2016 surpassing the established legal limit were the result of circumstances or incidents beyond the
payment policies, mainly the delay in issuing invoices (legal obligation of the supplier), the closing of
agreements with suppliers over the delivery of goods or the rendering of services, or occasional
processing issues. The average payment period to suppliers of the Telefonica Group's companies in Spain
in 2016, calculated In accordance with the only additional provision of the Resolution of the Instituto de
Contabilidad y Auditoria de Cuentas (Spanish Accounting and Audit Institute) dated January 29, 2016,
amounted to 45 days (49 days in 2015).

Governance system

The Company has a governance system, which applies to Telefénica's entire structure. Pursuant to the
Company's commitment to its shareholders, the Board of Directors, supported by its Committees,
manages the Company's business in accordance with the corporate governance rules laid down primarily
in the Corporate By-laws, in the Regulation of the General Shareholders’ Meeting, and in the Regulation of
the Board of Directors.

Telefénica's Board of Directors consists of 18 directors and is responsible for overseeing and controlling
the Company's activity. It has sole powers regarding general strategy and policies on corporate
governance, corporate social responsibility, remuneration of the Board and senior management,
shareholder remuneration, and strategic investments.

In order to strengthen the corporate governance of the Company, the Board of Directors of Telefénica,
S.A. has six committees (including the Executive Commission) which are charged with examining and
overseeing areas of particular relevance. Pursuant to its regulation, the Board also confers responsibility
for day-to-day management of the businesses to Telefénica's executive bodies (primarily through the
Executive Committee) and management team.

Telefonica 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements

Definitions

Below are definitions of certain technical terms used in this report:

“Access” refers to a connection to any of the telecommunications services offered by Telefonica. A single
fixed customer may contract for multiple services, and Telefénica believes that it is more useful to count
the number of accesses a customer has contracted for, than to merely count the number of Telefénica’s
customers. For example, a customer that has fixed line telephony service and broadband service is
counted as two accesses rather than as one customer.

“ARPU” is the average revenues per user per month. ARPU is calculated by dividing total gross service
revenues (excluding inbound roaming revenues) from sales to customers for the preceding 12 months by
the weighted average number of accesses for the same period, and then dividing by 12.

“Bundles” refer to combination products that combine fixed services (wirelines, broad band and
television) and mobile services.

“Churn” is the percentage of disconnections over the average customer base in a given period.

“Cloud computing” is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby shared
resources, software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility over a
network (typically the Internet).

“Commercial activity” includes the addition of new lines, replacement of handsets and migrations.

“Data ARPU" is the average data revenues per user per month. Data ARPU is calculated by dividing total
data revenues from sources such as Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Services
(MMS), other mobile data services such as mobile connectivity and mobile Internet, premium messaging,
downloading ringtones and logos, mobile mail and wireless application protocol (WAP) connectivity from
sales to customers for the relevant period by the weighted average number of accesses for the same
period, and then dividing by the relevant period.

“Data revenues” include revenues from SMS, MMS, other mobile data services such as mobile
connectivity and mobile Internet, premium messaging, downloading ringtones and logos, mobile mail and
WAP connectivity from sales to customers.

“Data traffic" includes all traffic from Internet access, messaging (SMS, MMS) and connectivity services
that is transported by the networks owned by Telefonica.

“FaasT” is a cybersecurity technology that scans an organization's system 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, in order to prevent cybernetic attacks.

“Fixed telephony accesses” includes public switched telephone network, or PSTN, lines (including public
use telephony), and integrated services digital network, or ISDN, lines and circuits. For purposes of
calculating Telefénica's number of fixed line accesses, Telefonica multiplies its lines in service as follows:
PSTN (x1); basic ISDN (x1); primary ISDN (x30, x20 or x10); 2/6 digital accesses (x30).

broadband final customer circuits. Internet and data accesses also include “Naked ADSL", which allows
customers to subscribe for a broadband connection without a monthly fixed line fee.

“IPTV” (Internet Protocol Television) refers to distribution systems for television subscription signals
or video using broadband connections over the IP protocol.

“ISP” means Internet service provider.

“IT", or information technology, is the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of vocal,

MVNO pays a determined tariff to such a mobile network operator for using the infrastructure to facilitate
coverage to their customers.

“Net adds” means the number of new accesses in a certain period.
“Non SMS data revenues” means data revenues excluding SMS revenues.

“OTT services" or “over the top services" means services provided through the Internet (such as
