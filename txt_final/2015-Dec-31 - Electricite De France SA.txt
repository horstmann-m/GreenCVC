PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY

1.1 History and development of the Company

EDF was created in 1946. Before 1946, the electricity sector had developed
around numerous local companies across France. At the end of the 1930s,
there were approximately 200 generation companies, approximately
100 transmission companies and 1,150 distribution companies.

In 1946, the electricity and gas sectors were nationalized. The Act of 8 April
1946 created EDF as a State-owned industrial and commercial establishment
and created a special status for the personnel of the electric and gas
industries (IEG). The Law nevertheless left in existence a certain number of
non-nationalized distributors (DNN) and local distribution companies (ELD).

Between 1946 and 2000, the Group’s industrial base was developed. Initially,
there was a fleet of thermal generation facilities using coal and then fuel oil,
as well as hydropower facilities, in particular with the construction of the
dams at Tignes in 1952 and Serre-Poncon in 1960. In 1963, following the
French government's decision to guarantee France's energy independence
through nuclear power, EDF commissioned the first commercial-scale nuclear
generation unit at Chinon (70MW), the first of a series of six generation
units of the Uranium Natural Graphite Gas (UNGG) family, the construction
of which continued until 1972. The oil crises of 1973 and 1979 led to
accelerated replacement of thermal power with nuclear power. In 1969, the
UNGG family was abandoned in favour of the Pressurised Water Reactor
(PWR) family, which was used for new power plants: 34 generation units
totalling 9OOMW, which were built until 1988; then, 20 generation units
totalling 1,300MW, which were built until 1994; then, four N4 generation
units totalling 1,450MW, which were commissioned in 2000 and 2002.

Beginning in the 1990s, EDF embarked on significant expansion abroad
in particular with, in December 1998 the acquisition of 100% of London
Electricity (which was renamed EDF Energy on 30 June 2003). This policy
was pursued in 2001 with the acquisition of 20% of EnBW (a stake that was
successively raised to 45.01% by 2005) and in 2001 with the acquisition
of equity interests in the Italian company Edison by the IEB consortium
(63.8%), in which EDF holds a stake of 18.03%, and in 2002, when London
Electricity acquired 100% of the share capital of EPN Distribution Plc. and
Seeboard Plc., two distribution companies located, respectively, in the east
and the southeast of England.

In France, the major development in recent years has been the liberalisation
of the market pursuant to European regulations. In February 1999, sites
where electricity consumption exceeded 100GWh per year, i.e. 20% of the
market, became entitled to choose their supplier. The eligibility threshold
was then progressively lowered. In May 2000, 30% of the market was
thus opened to competition, then 37% in February 2003. In July 2004,
all of the market for non-household customers, equivalent to 69% of the
entire market, was liberalised. Since July 2007, the market has been fully
liberalised, including for residential customers.

At the same time, the structures necessary for a competitive market
to function effectively were set up. The French Electricity Regulation
Commission, which became the Energy Regulation Commission (Commission

12 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

de Régulation de I’Energie or CRE) was created in May 2000. That same
year, in order to guarantee non-discriminatory access to all operators in
the market, EDF created Réseau de Transport d’Electricité (which became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of EDF in 2005 under the name RTE EDF Transport,
and which has been renamed RTE Réseau de Transport d’Electricité), an
independent internal entity responsible for managing the high voltage and
very high voltage public electricity transmission network. In 2000, the Group
formed the trading company, EDF Trading, with the trading specialist Louis
Dreyfus. It became a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDF in 2003. In 2001,
Euronext and various industrial and financial operators in the electricity
market, including EDF, created Powernext, the French electricity exchange.
In 2001, as a condition for authorising EDF's acquisition of a stake in EnBW,
the European Commission required EDF to set up a system of power supply
capacity auctions (Virtual Power Plants or VPP) to facilitate access to the
market for competitors. In 2003, the EDF group sold its stake in Compagnie
Nationale du Rh6ne to Suez (now Engie).

On 20 November 2004, pursuant to the Act of 9 August 2004, EDF became
a French limited company (société anonyme) with a Board of Directors.

In 2005, EDF and A2A SA (formerly AEM SpA) entered into agreements for
a joint takeover of Edison following the launch of a tender offer. The EDF
group has pursued a strategy of refocusing on Europe and sold its controlling
interest in its subsidiaries Edenor and Light and its assets in Mexico.

EDF filed for an initial public offering in the second half of 2005. Pursuant to
this transaction, the Company offered 196,371,090 newly issued shares and
the French government sold over 34.5 million shares it held to employees
and former employees of EDF and of certain EDF subsidiaries. Subsequently,
on 3 December 2007, the French government sold an additional 45 million
of its shares.

In late November 2006, EDF Energies Nouvelles, a subsidiary in which the
EDF group holds a 50% stake, filed for an initial public offering.

Since 1 January 2008, EDF's distribution business has been conducted by
Electricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
EDF to which the distribution business was contributed pursuant to the Act
of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector.

In 2008-2009, the EDF group became a major player in the revival of nuclear
power internationally, by creating a joint venture with the Chinese utility
CGN, acquiring British Energy, one of the largest energy companies in the
United Kingdom, and acquiring nearly half of the nuclear assets of US-
based Constellation Energy. EDF also acquired a 51% stake in the Belgian
company EDF Luminus, and subsequently raised its stake in EDF Luminus
to 63.5% in 2010.

EDF finalised in 2010 the sale of its British distribution networks to the
Cheung Kong group of Hong Kong and, in 2011, it completed the sale of
its 45.01% interest in EnBW to the German state of Baden-Wirttemberg.

In 2011, after ten years of a strategic partnership in which it held a 50%
stake in EDF Energies Nouvelles, EDF confirmed its positioning as a key player
in the field of power generation using renewable energies by increasing
its stake in the company to 100% pursuant to a simplified alternative cash
or exchange tender offer for EDF Energies Nouvelles shares, followed by a
squeeze-out of minority shareholders.

In 2012, after more than seven years of a strategic partnership with A2A, EDF
took over Edison, the oldest Italian electricity company and one of the key
players in the Italian electricity market, the fourth largest market in Europe.
This transaction was carried out as part of the group’s gas strategy, which
will rely on Edison‘s expertise at all stages of the gas chain, from hydrocarbon
exploration and production to direct sales of natural gas.

In 2013, EDF and Energeticky a primyslovy holding, a.s. (EPH), the leading
Czech energy company in central and Eastern Europe, signed a final
agreement for the sale to EPH of 49% of Stredoslovenska Energetika a.s.
(SSE), second electricity distributor and supplier in Slovakia.

In 2014, EDF has delegated to Exelon, the leading American nuclear operator,
the operational management of the five nuclear reactors owned by CENG,
held by EDF (49.99%) and Exelon (50.01%). Furthermore, EDF took over
all of Dalkia’s lines of business in France, including the Citelum group,
and Veolia took over the Dalkia group’‘s international business. Finally, F2i,
Edison and EDF Energies Nouvelles created the third largest Italian operator
in the renewable energy sector, with an installed capacity of approximately
600MW, owned by F2i (70%) and an holding company (30%) owned by
Edison and EDF Energies Nouvelles.

On 10 December 2015, EDF International (EDF |) and EP Energy, a.s., through
its subsidiary company EP Hungary, completed the transaction for the sale
of EDF's majority stake in Hungary-based Budapesti Erémt Zrt, that owns
three gas-fired cogeneration (combined heat & power) plants.

On 21 December 2015, EDF and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund IV
(MEIF4) completed the transaction for the sale of EDF's minority stake of
25% in Energie Steiermark AG to MEIF4. EDF announced on 10 July 2015
it had entered into an agreement with MEIF4.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
GROUP STRATEGY

1.2.2 INTRA-GROUP CONTRACTS

Cash pooling agreements entered into between
EDF and its susidiaries

The cash pooling system set up by EDF centralises all the cash positions
of its subsidiaries and thus optimises the Group's liquidity. Cash pooling
consists of grouping all the cash balances of subsidiaries at the level of the
parent company. It includes certain French and international subsidiaries.
It does not include RTE.

The cash pooling system in place for companies of the EDF group is defined
under cash agreements. Bilateral agreements between EDF and each
subsidiary define the specific conditions for each arrangement (remuneration
of balances, etc.).

At international level, subsidiaries participating in the system enter into a
framework agreement, whereby EDF serves as the Cash Centre.

EDF also centralises all the currency flows from its French subsidiaries.

Financial flows between EDF and its subsidiaries

In addition to the financial flows relating to the cash pooling agreements
mentioned above, financial flows between EDF and its subsidiaries are also
related to distributions of dividends within the Group. A substantial portion
of the dividends paid by some of the Group’‘s subsidiaries (including EDF
Energy) is paid exclusively to EDF International. Total dividends received by
EDF International in 2015 amounted to €217 million. In 2015, EDF received
a total of €2,066 million in dividends from its consolidated subsidiaries.

Other financial flows between EDF and its subsidiaries correspond mainly
to loans, asset transfers and guarantees made by the parent company of
the Group for the benefit of certain subsidiaries.

In the context of the Group’s financing centralisation policy, decided on in
2006, EDF centralises the financing of its subsidiaries. In this context, EDF
created a subsidiary located in Belgium, EDF Investissements Groupe, which
aims to grant medium- and long-term intra-group financing.

In addition, the nuclear fuel purchases are managed centrally by EDF SA,
including the purchases intended to its subsidiary EDF Energy.

With regard to financial flows related to fees paid by subsidiaries, contracts
for the supply of intra-group services have been concluded with the main
subsidiaries under the scope of consolidation since 2012. EDF may also be
required to provide specific services to certain subsidiaries or entities outside
‘the Group. In addition, following EDF brand development work, the Company
has set up licensing agreements with subsidiaries that use the EDF brand.

1.3.1 ENVIRONMENT AND STRATEGIC
CHALLENGES

The market and the regulatory environment are currently constraining the
economic model of European electricity producers, at a time when significant
investment is required to maintain existing assets and, over the longer-term,
to renew the generation fleet:

® electricity demand in Europe is subdued (annual average of +0.6%
between 2000 and 2014 ') but significant subsidised energy capacity
has been connected to the grids (+45GW of wind between 2010 and
2014, representing +53% ”), creating over-capacity in the European
generation fleet;

= fuel prices have fallen (oil, gas, coal) and this intensified at end-2015;

@ the price of CO, is very low, which is inconsistent with the low carbon
and energy transition goals in Europe;

m the upshot is lower prices in the electricity market, which fell at a quicker
pace at end-2015;

™ this overcapacity of the European generation fleet may continue (except
in the United Kingdom (UK)) if the public authorities do nothing to alter
the market environment.

By way of contrast, electricity consumption is rising fast in emerging markets,
especially in Asia, benefiting the electricity producers in these regions with
forecasts ' of around +190TWh per year in China between 2013 and 2040
(42.5% per year on average) and +50TWh/year in Africa (+3.9% per year),
versus +7TWh per year in the European Union (+0.2% per year).

16 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

In Europe, France and the United Kingdom are developing low-carbon
energy independence policies, primarily built around a mix combining
energy efficiency, renewable and nuclear energies, with an additional gas
component offering flexibility to electricity systems. In France, electricity is
also used as a means of migrating to low carbon, and the United Kingdom
has established a market model consistent with this policy (Carbon Price
Floor, Contracts for Difference, capacity market, etc.).

The agreement reached in Paris at the 21% session of the Conference of
Parties (COP 21) confirms the effort being made to combat climate change
and the ramping up of energy transitions beyond Europe.

Furthermore, local communities and customers are looking to increasingly
take ownership of their consumption and of their energy policy. These
new expectations are forcing energy producers to come up with new
solutions and new more decentralised models, facilitated by innovations
in telecommunications and digital technologies, and the emergence of
new uses.

The electricity sector is thus changing more than ever, at the centre of
medium and long-term societal and technological trends. Against this
background, and with this in mind, European electricity producers have scaled
back their investments and focussed them on targeted segments, particularly
renewable energy, growth areas, distribution, network and services.

EDF is thus faced with specific strategic challenges:

® to play a responsible role in combating climate change: to contribute to
the achievement of the goals set out in the Energy Transition and Green
Growth Law in France, in the Climate Change Act in the UK, and more
broadly in the 2020 and 2030 Energy and Climate Change Packages in
the European Union;


--- Page 6 ---

m to ensure the economic performance and safety of the nuclear assets;

® to innovate in order to set itself apart and to have the technological
and economic capabilities to renew and expand its generation and its
services to customers, in particular digital, and thereby play a role in
energy security;

m to ensure that the EDF group is consistency a stellar public service
operator, in particular in terms of solidarity and the fight against energy
poverty, respect, responsibility and ethics in the way it runs its business;

= to adapt to put the Group on a sustainable value creation path for all
stakeholders;

= to mobilise employees and create an environment that hitches each
person's development to the Group’s transformation.

1.3.2 STRATEGIC VISION

A responsible, efficient electricity producer that champions low carbon
growth: this is the goal of the EDF group, driven by the CAP 2030 strategy.
This goal can be split into three priorities, which combine the search for
growth drivers with the optimisation of existing assets:

= proximity to customers and local communities;

= low carbon generation, with a balanced mix of nuclear and renewable
energy;

® international expansion.

1.3.2.1

Proximity to customers and local
communities

In order to support customers and local communities with their energy
transition, the EDF group is already developing competitive low carbon
energy solutions for its customers and the local communities, and is an
industrial leader in smart grids.

The Group's strong position in energy services in France via Dalkia should
provide a basis to support companies and local authorities in achieving
energy performance and developing decentralised, local generation. A
range of digital energy services for residential customers will be rolled out by
2018 in France and in the core European countries (real time consumption
monitoring amongst others). In parallel, relationship with these customers
will be enhanced thanks to new digital technologies and functionality,
particularly downstream with smart metering systems rolled out in a number
of countries.

The EDF group is achieving the energy transition:

= by developing energy saving solutions for its customers (insulation, high-
efficiency solutions, deployement of digital tools as e.quilibre enabling
customers to pilot their consumptions...);

= by working to replace fossil fuels with new efficient uses of electricity,
so that they represent an additional 15 to 30TWh in France by 2030
(electric mobility, low carbon habitat, etc.);

® by developing and operating heating networks that use renewable and
recovery energies;

= by leveraging the specific experiences from island regions.

Finally, the development of renewable energies, the roll-out of Linky smart
meters and the emergence of metropolitan areas are putting the distribution
networks at the heart of the electricity system. The distributor plays a key
role, making it a facilitator of the energy transition.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
GROUP STRATEGY

To support the energy transitions, the Group accelerates Research &
Development on storage, solar, electric mobility and new networks. It also
redoubles its efforts in terms of innovation to offer to its clients solutions
and services that best meet their needs.

1.3.2.2 Low carbon generation:
nuclear and renewable energies

To remain the leader in large low carbon electricity generation facilities,
the Group is looking to balance its generation mix by accelerating the
development of renewable energy and by ensuring the safety and
performance of the existing nuclear fleet and of nuclear new build. In fact,
EDF's nuclear fleet is already giving France a major lead vis-a-vis its neighbours
in terms of limiting greenhouse gas emissions.

The low carbon generation goal requires the development of the Group’s
renewable energy and hydropower asset base, with the aim of almost
doubling its installed capacity: from 28GW in 2014 to 50GW in 2030. The
development of these assets outside France will be done in line with the
Group's international strategy.

Subject to the necessary approvals, EDF will invest to extend, under the
highest safety conditions, the operating life of the French nuclear fleet
beyond 40 years, the economic and carbon competitiveness of this fleet
being in fact proven. In this context, the “Grand Carénage” principle has
already been approved on 22 January 2015 by the Board of Directors of
EDF. There will also be investment to extend the operating life of the existing
UK fleet by an average of 8 years. The Group also wants to ensure the
competitiveness of the nuclear new build to offer an option to renew all or
part of its European fleets. As a responsible electricity producer, the Group.
will also carry on being involved in the preparations for the decommissioning
of the nuclear fleet and for the management of waste in France and the UK.

In line with the priority of having low carbon generation, EDF supports
changes to electricity market design in Europe, in particular an increase
in the CO, price in order to send a strong economic signal regarding the
competitiveness of low carbon investments.

1.3.2.3. International expansion

The EDF group wants to be a key player in the energy market in France and
in its core countries by playing a role in energy security, in the enhancing of
economic competitiveness and in the migration of the European economy
to low carbon, in line with public policy.

The Group is also looking to expand outside the European plate, now highly
exposed to the market prices decrease and whose growth prospects are
limited. In this context, it focuses on a limited number of international target
countries, on which it can deploy its industry expertise alongside partners
in organic growth projects.

The Group will call upon all of its areas of expertise that can contribute to
this growth: renewables, energy services, nuclear new build but also other
engineering (network, thermal, hydropower, etc.), trading and gas delivery
capabilities in Europe and worldwide.

1.3.2.4 Broad principles of CAP 2030

1.3.2.4.1 Transformation
The Group is mobilising employees around a new human vision that reflects
its challenges and the expectations of its employees: health & safety, digital
and new work practices, responsibility and streamlining, skills, recognition
model.

EDF | 2015 Reference Document 17

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

In order to further this human vision, the Group is adapting its managerial
practices, streamlining its organisations and modus operandi and enhancing
cross-disciplinarity and promotion of innovation.

EDF's digital transformation is accelerating: for employees and internal
modus operandi, for customers, for the management and the design of
industrial assets.

As both an input and outcome of the transformation programme, improved
performance is a priority. The Group is strengthening control of its costs
to bring them into line with its environment. The approach is adjusted
depending on the scopes involved (cross-disciplinary segments, operating
entities, etc.).

1.3.2.4.2 EDF in 2030

The CAP 2030 goal allows the Group to develop an asset portfolio built
around low carbon energy: services for customers, decentralised energy
solutions, nuclear and renewables. The key factors to the success of
CAP 2030 are:

@ the control of major projects and the success of “design to cost” (/.e.
a design that ensures both safety and competitiveness) of new nuclear
reactor models;

m the selectiveness of international investments;
™ the leveraging of the customer portfolio;

= the transformation of the Group’s modus operandi and the collective
commitment.

1.3.3 INVESTMENT POLICY

1.3.3.1. Investments in 2015

The Group continued its programme of gross operating investments
totalling €14.8 billion in 2015, versus €13.7 billion in 2014. Gross operating

investments for development represented €5.1 billion in 2015, including
€1.8 billion in renewable energies (including hydropower) and €1.7 billion
in New Nuclear. Net investments, including Linky and new developments
net of assets disposals, totalled €12.7 billion in 2015, versus €11.9 billion
in 2014, split across regulated (26%) and non-regulated activities (74%).

In the non-regulated field, net investments of development of new capacities
(in particular renewable energy and nuclear new build in France and the UK)
amounted to €3.2 billion. Investments in maintenance totalled €6.2 billion,
including €3.6 billion for nuclear maintenance in France.

Net investments in France (€9.1 billion) were up 3.5%, reflecting the Group's
desire over the past years to invest in the industrial facilities. The Group
continued its efforts made in international investments (€3.1 billion), in
particular through its EDF Energy subsidiary in the UK for close to €1.8 billion,
and via its Italian subsidiaries (Edison and Fenice) for €0.6 billion. €0.5 billion
was also invested in other activities (EDF Energies Nouvelles, gas business
and Dalkia in particular), mostly located in France.

1.3.3.2 Investments over 2016-2018

For the 2016-2018 period, the Group will deliver large industrial projects,
some of which are already at an advanced stage, such as the LNG terminal
in Dunkirk or the EPR (European Pressurized water Reactor) of Flamanville 3.
The Group also plans to continue investing in nuclear new builds in the UK,
distribution networks in France, and in renewable energy in accordance
with its integrated electricity producer strategy and in light of the CAP 2030
programme. Thus, the Group reached an amount of net investment peak in
2015 of €12.7 billion, i.e. €12.4 billion excluding new developments net of
assets disposals. These investments should reduce gradually as significant
projects are commissioned, to attain a maximum of €10.5 billion in 2018,
excluding new developments net of assets disposals. The development
projects will have to be financed through the sale of non-strategic assets,
in line with the CAP 2030 strategy.

[| 1.4 Description of the Group's activities

The EDF group is an integrated utility, active in all electricity businesses:
nuclear, renewable and thermal generation, transmission, distribution,
supply, efficiency and energy services and trading. It is the leading player in
the French electricity market and holds strong positions in Europe (United
Kingdom (UK), Italy, central and eastern European countries), which makes
it one of the world’s leading electric utility and a renowned gas player.

With a global installed net generation capacity of 134.2GWe' as at
31 December 2015 producing 619.3TWh', the Group has one of the largest
generation fleet in the world. Among the ten largest global power suppliers,
it produces the smallest amount of CO, per kilowatt-hour generated *
thanks to the share of nuclear, hydro and other renewable energies in its
generation mix.

The EDF group supplies electricity, gas and related services to 37.6 million
customer accounts? worldwide (of which 27.8 million in France).

18 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

Electricity generation is a non-regulated activity, which is open to competition
in the same way as the sale of electricity and gas (see section 1.4.2 “Sales and
supply activities”) and upstream/downstream optimisation (see section 1.4.3
“Optimisation and trading activities"). The Group is thus implementing an
integrated model for the joint operational management of its portfolio of
assets upstream (generation and procurement of energy and fuels) and
downstream (wholesale and retail) to guarantee supply of energy to its
customers through the best possible management of operational and market
risks and with a view to maximising gross margin.

In addition, the Group is also active in regulated sectors such as electricity
transmission and distribution (see section 1.4.4 “Regulated activities in
France”).


--- Page 8 ---

1.4.1 ELECTRICITY GENERATION ACTIVITIES
IN FRANCE

In mainland France, the electricity generation activities have been split since
2015 across the Nuclear and Thermal Fleet Department and the Renewable
Energy Division. In addition to these two departments, the Engineering and
Nuclear New Build Project Department is responsible for the development
projects for the Group's new nuclear generation assets, in France and abroad.
Each of these three departments has all the expertise and performance
drivers required to operate the leading European electricity generation fleet
and ensure its development and sustainability, and offer their technical
and industrial expertise to the whole Group in these three areas (also see
section 1.4.5 “Group’‘s international business”).

Strengths of the generation fleet

The Group's generation fleet has significant strengths:

= acompetitive generation mix with low variable generation costs 'and
limited exposure to hydrocarbon and carbon market fluctuations due
to nuclear and hydropower facilities;

= a variety of means of generation, which enable adequate coverage
of EDF's downstream portfolio needs (end users, sales to alternative
suppliers, sales on the wholesale markets, etc.). Use of the fleet’s
various components is managed by giving priority, at any given time,
to the generation type offering the lowest variable costs: run-of-river
hydropower plants are used for base generation; nuclear plants, because
of their low variable generation costs, are used for base and mid-merit
generation; adjustable hydropower generation (coming from dams) and
thermal plants are used for mid-merit and peak generation;

® asignificant standardised fleet of nuclear facilities, for which EDF provides
full control over their entire life cycle. Moreover, EDF is working towards
extending the operating life of its power plants and improving their
technical performance;

= a fleet generating at over 95% without CO, emissions due to the
predominance of nuclear and hydropower generation facilities, in an
increasingly restrictive environmental regulatory context;

= ageographical position at the junction of electricity exchanges between
the continental platform and the electric peninsulas (Italy, Spain and
the UK).

Composition and specifications of the installed fleet
With a total installed generation capacity of 95.2GW in mainland France?
at 31 December 2015, EDF has the largest generation fleet in Europe,
accounting for nearly 10% of the total installed capacity of the main
countries of Europe (the 35 member areas of ENTSO-E — the European
Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity — that includes
Germany, Italy and Spain).

In 2015 in France, EDF's generation fleet produced 455.7TWh excluding
pumped storage hydropower, and 462.5TWh including pumped storage
hydropower.

At 31 December 2015, the capacity of EDF's generation fleet in mainland
France was composed of:

= 58 nuclear units based on pressurised water reactors (PWR) (a unit is
defined as a generation unit including a reactor, steam generators,
a turbine, a generator, the related equipment and the buildings that
house them). These units have electrical power capacities varying from
900MW to 1,500MW and are spread out over 19 sites, with an average
age of 30 years;

= 27 functioning thermal units, with those in service having an average
age of approximately 24 years;

= 433 hydropower plants, with an average age of 71 years * (see
section 1.4.1.4.1 “Hydropower generation in France");

= the wind power generation capacities of EDF Energies Nouvelles in France
(see section 1.4.1.4.3 “EDF Energies Nouvelles”) and the incineration
plants of the Tiru group in France (see section 1.4.6.1.3 “Tiru");

= 81 hydropower plants owned by Group subsidiaries: SHEMA (100%),
FHYM (98.82%), CERGA (owned 50/50 with the German electricity
company EnBW). These plants represent a total of approximately
184MW of installed capacity in 2015 and approximately 951GWh of
energy production *.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

1.4.1.1. Nuclear electricity generation

The electricity generated by EDF from its fleet of nuclear power plants
represented 91.4% of its total electricity generation in 2015 excluding
pumped storage hydropower.

1.4.1.1.1 EDF's nuclear fleet

EDF's PWR model is divided into three series of available electrical power:

= a 900MW series consisting of 34 units of approximately 9OOMW (for a
total power capacity of 30,770MW) with an average age of 34 years;

= a1,300MW series consisting of 20 units of approximately 1,300MW (for
a total power capacity of 26,370MW) with an average age of 27 years;

m the N4 series, which is the most recent with an average age of 15 years,
consisting of 4 units of approximately 1,500MW (for a total power
capacity of 5,990MW);

for a total of 58 units spread over 19 sites owned by EDF, and constituting
a total installed capacity of 63,130MW as at 31 December 2015. With
an average age of approximately 30 years for an estimated technical
operating life of over 40 years (benchmark time for accounting purposes
and corresponding to the initial nuclear unit design), the EDF's nuclear fleet
is in the average of the fleets installed worldwide.

The commissioning and most recent ten-year inspection (VD) dates for these units as of end-2015 are as follows:

EDF first-generation design plants have been gradually shut down and are
currently being decommissioned (see section 1.4.1.1.6 “Decommissioning
of nuclear power plants”).

Generation allocation contracts

EDF has developed industrial cooperation with European operators in the
nuclear industry, in the form of generation allocation contracts backed by
units of the EDF French nuclear fleet.

In its fleet, EDF has ten generating units participating in the contracts (up
to 1.5GW) with the following European energy companies:

m Fessenheim 1-2: EnBW (17.5%) and the Swiss electricity group CNP
(15%);

= Cattenom 1-2: EnBW (5%);

m Bugey 2-3: Electricité de Laufenbourg' (17.5%);

= Tricastin 1 to 4: Electrabel2 (12.5%);

™ = Chooz B1-B2: EDF Luminus, EDF subsidiary in Belgium (3.3%).

The purpose of these generation allocation contracts is to make available to
each partner the proportion of energy generated actually due to them — in
return for payment of their share of the construction costs, annual operating
costs (including upstream and downstream fuel costs), local taxes and taxes
specific to nuclear energy, and the costs relating to decommissioning. In
these transactions, the partners have shared with EDF the industrial risks in
the development of the fleet (three series heads are concerned) and assume
the risks on performance linked to the current operation of the power plants.
On the other hand, they have no operational role.

Furthermore, EDF signed a second type of generation allocation contract
(totalling approximately 2GW) that enables its partners to receive a share
of the electricity generated from a given power plant fleet based on the
average actual performance of that fleet. These contracts mainly concern
the following power plants:

= Chooz B1-B2 (N4 initial series unit): Electrabel (21.7%);
= Cattenom 3-4: Electricité de Laufenbourg (7.8%) and CNP (21.8%).

1.4.1.1.2 Operation and technical performance
of the nuclear fleet

Nuclear power is a means of generation whose variable cost, mainly fuel-
related costs, is low since it represents less than 30% of operating costs*.
The main competitive levers of the nuclear fleet in its operating phase are
thus the amount of generated energy and the optimisation of fixed operating
and maintenance costs. The levers relating to the fuel cycle are further
discussed in section 1.4.1.1.4 “The nuclear fuel cycle and related issues”.

Operation methods of the nuclear fleet

Generation cycle and planned outages

To reconcile the challenges linked to the strong variations in seasonal
consumption in France, due to its strong temperature sensitivity, the
availability of maintenance resources and the efficient use of reactor fuel,

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

EDF has now adopted generation cycles of 12 and 18 months for its fleet.
At the end of 2015, this breakdown was as follows:

= 28 units of the 900MW series have an operating cycle of approximately
12 months;

= 6units of the 900MW series, 20 units of the 1,300MW series and 4 units
of the N4 (1,450MW) series have an operating cycle of approximately
18 months.

At the end of these operating cycles, shutdown periods are programmed
in order to replace a fraction of the fuel loaded in the core and perform
maintenance work.

Two types of planned outages are alternated at the end of each generation
cycle:

=™ an ordinary shutdown for refuelling, for a standard period* of
approximately 35 days, during which unloading spent fuel and reloading
new fuel is the main operation performed; although light maintenance
or periodic testing may also take place during this type of outage;

= apartial inspection for refuelling and maintenance, for which the standard
period? lasts approximately 70 days.

Every ten years, the power plant is shut down for a standard period * of
approximately 110 days in order to carry out a ten-year inspection. This
length of time varies according to the works and maintenance programme,
as well as the series concerned. The programme for a ten-year inspection
includes the following:

= unloading of spent fuel and reloading of fresh fuel, as at each outage;

= hydropower tests of the primary circuit, a leak test of the vault, and
inspection work of the reactor’s pressure vessel;

= modification work, associated with ten-year safety re-evaluations;

= other specific maintenance operations, in particular renovation or
replacement of major components.

At the end of the ten-year inspection, the ASN decides whether to authorise
the restart of the reactor and then issues technical prescriptions setting the
conditions for continuing operation for another ten-year period.

Operation of EDF's nuclear fleet

Nuclear generation resources, owing to their low variable cost are first used
for base-load generation, immediately after run-of-river hydropower and
other unavoidable renewable energies, as well as the energy purchased
under buying obligations from decentralised energy producers. Variations
in the energy consumption of EDF's final customers over one year (summer-
winter, day-night) and the currently restricted fluidity of wholesale markets.
due to limited interconnections on the borders lead nuclear energy to be
used also for mid-merit generation. High variations in seasonal consumption
in France and its major variation during winter months require that planned
nuclear fleet outages be concentrated between April and October. The 2003
heat wave highlighted the consequences of very strong warming of rivers,
especially on the conditions for operating “riverside” units. The scheduling
of unit outages was therefore reviewed to reduce the number of outages of
“riverside” units in July and August to encourage these units to continue
operating as much as possible since cooling capacities are less dependent
on weather conditions.

3. Operating costs are defined as follows: fuel costs (including downstream expenses in the fuel cycle), operating expenses (purchases and external services, employee
expenses) and maintenance costs (expenses and investments). They do not include investments related to construction or decommissioning expenses.

4. Standard durations are adapted to the volume of routine maintenance required.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Generation and technical performance

The nuclear fleet produced 416.8TWh in 2015, up 0.9TWh compared to
that of 2014.

Nuclear generation expressed in annual energy corresponds to a load factor
rate referred to as “Kp” for the French nuclear fleet (defined as the ratio
of energy generated to the maximum theoretical energy, or the energy
generated if the installed capacity were operated year-round). This rate is
obtained by multiplying two coefficients (Kp = Kd x Ku):

@ the availability factor, “Kd” (the available energy ' as a percent of the
theoretical maximum energy, or the energy generated if the installed
capacity were operated year-round);

= a utilisation factor, “Ku” (energy generated compared to energy
available). The Ku factor reflects environmental and social constraints,
supply of system services and optimisation implemented by EDF (fuel
and modulation).

In 2015 the Kp factor was 75.4%, up compared to 75.2% in 2014. This
results from a Kd of 80.8%, almost unchanged compared to 2014 (80.9%)
and a Ku of 93.3%, up 0.3 points compared to 2014.

The year 2015 is characterised by:

™ ongoing good performance in terms of unplanned outages (a rate of
2.5% in 2015 compared to 2.4% in 2014), thanks to the proactive
maintenance strategy implemented in 2007 for renovation and
replacement of major components;

™ managed outage periods, with average planned outage times cut in
half between 2013 and 2014 and down 0.4 days between 2014 and
2015. This is the result of the procedures for managing planned outages
implemented in 2013 and strengthened since then, aiming to stabilise
the volume of regular maintenance during outages, improve the quality
of preparation of maintenance work and strengthen the control of
restart operations.

However, as the fleet has entered a significant maintenance programme
scheduled for the coming years, including a substantial volume of work
resulting in extended outage times, the challenge in future years will be to
industrially control the programme and its impact on the duration of outages.
Moreover, in view of the strong seasonal demand for electricity in France
and of the state of development of renewable energies, the challenges have
moved. Today, EDF's objective is to have a maximum generation capacity
in winter, including sustained availability of the nuclear fleet greater than
90% during this important period of the year. In winter 2015-20162, this
reached 93.4%.

Investment programme for the existing nuclear fleet
in France

On 22 January 2015, EDF's Board of Directors approved in principle the major
overhaul programme (so-called “Grand Carénage”) aimed at refurbishing
the French nuclear fleet, enhancing reactor safety, and, if conditions
allow, extending their operating lives, involving total investment of up to
©0135 billion by 2025 for the 58 reactors currently operating. This figure
represents ongoing maintenance investment of around €3 billion a year
(including ongoing maintenance, ten-year inspections and periodic safety
review) together with additional investment of between €1 and €2 billion a
year on average, reflecting the extraordinary nature of the “Grand Carénage”
(such as renovation of large components, replacing of steam generators at

midlife and incorporating Fukushima’s feedback). Beyond 2025, investments.
will gradually return to former levels. The figures presented by the French
Cour des Comptes in its report of 10 February 2016 cover a longer time
horizon, up to 2030, and a wider scope including, beyond the investment,
some operating expenses. Both assessments are consistent, as stated by the
Cour des comptes in its report. Indeed, in the comprehensive program of
the Cour des Comptes close to €,,,,100 billion for the 2014-2030 period,
it distinguishes investment expenditures estimated at €,,,;74.73 billion
and operating expenditures estimated at €,,,,25.16 billion. Within the
€01374.73 billion of investment expenses between 2014 and 2030, about
€501320 billion are dedicated to the 2026-2030 period, which allows
connecting the two estimates established by the EDF group and the Cour des
Comptes. This indicative number will be confirmed at a later date following
optimisation of the solutions used to implement the programme, additional
assessment work and consideration of the multi-year energy plan together
with the resulting strategic plan, provided for in the Energy Transition for
Green Growth Law. The optimisation work undertaken in 2015 has already
lead to a downward revision of the overall cost of the programme to
€ cont | billion over the 2014-2025 period, which represents a €,,,,9 billion
decrease. This revision was obtained mainly through continued efforts of
optimisation regarding the adopted technical solutions, as well as their finest
deployment including the capacities of industrial frame.

This industrial programme will be gradually implemented, in compliance
with the objectives of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Law, multi-
year energy plans, the opinions and orders of the French Nuclear Security
Authority (ASN), as well as the procedures for authorisation for reactors to
run for more than 40 years (see section 1.4.1.1.5 “Preparing for the future
of the nuclear fleet in France”).

EDF will thus continue a large volume of work, aiming in particular to
sustain and develop its technical and industrial assets through technical,
organisational and human actions. Programmes for renovation or
replacement of major components of power stations such as alternators,
transformers or steam generators will continue. At the end of 2015:

m the alternator stators were renovated on 42 units, for a total of 49 units
to renovate;

m the programme for preventive replacement of the poles in the main
transformers is ongoing. 78 main transformer poles out of 174 were
replaced, i.e. approximately 45% of the programme;

= between 1990 and the end of 2015, steam generators were replaced in
27 units, of which 1 in 2015. Amongst these, the replacement of three
steam generators in Blayais 3 was completed during the third ten-year
inspection of the unit. This had been delayed in the expectation that
AREVA, supplier of this equipment, would provide proof of meeting all
requirements required by the Decree of 12 December 2005 on nuclear
equipment under pressure (the “ESPN” Decree), in view of its assembly
and commissioning.

Concerning the organisational aspects of routine maintenance, EDF continues
to deploy the AP 913? procedure aiming for reliability and the preparation
of health reports of materials in order to reduce unplanned outages.

Strengthening the operational management of power generation and
planned outages also continues, through the systematic implementation, for
each outage, of an Operational Centre for Continuous Management of Unit
Outages and by rolling out a new Information System. The ultimate goal is
‘to reduce the average time of outage extensions by continued management
of the outage’s critical activities and a reactive response to technical alerts.

1. Available energy is equal to the maximum theoretical energy less losses for technical reasons inherent to power plants, such as planned outages, unplanned outages due to

failure or safety requirements, and performance of regulatory tests.
2. Period from 1 December 2015 to 14 February 2016.

The average time of extension of planned outages has been halved between
2013 and 2014, and decreased by 0.4 days between 2014 and 2015.

The industrial project for the nuclear fleet will continue beyond 2015 on the
occasion of the third and fourth series of ten-year inspections of 1,300MW,
units, the fourth series of ten-year inspections of 90OMW units and the
second and third series of ten-year inspections of N4 units. This project
will provide the opportunity to incorporate additional safety improvements
identified following the Fukushima accident as well as modifications allowing
the operation of facilities to be extended significantly beyond 40 years (see
section 1.4.1.1.5 “Preparing for the future of the nuclear fleet in France”).

1.4.1.1.3 Environment, nuclear safety,
radiation protection

Environmental protection

EDF bases its environmental procedure on an ISO 14001-certified
management system (see section 3.2.2.1.1 “Environmental management
system (SME)"), rolled out in 2002 at a number of sites and then extended
to all nuclear generation units.

In terms of the radioactive waste management, Very Low-Level Waste
(VLLW) has been removed to the Morvilliers disposal facility in the Aube
since 2004. Concerning Low- and Intermediate-Level operating Waste
(LILW), EDF is continuing to take steps to limit its intermediate storage on
all nuclear sites and relies on the Centraco factory (SOCODEI, a subsidiary
of the EDF group), where the melting oven was restarted in April 2015 and
which is now once again operating normally.

For a description of radioactive waste processing downstream of the fuel
cycle as well as decommissioning, see sections 1.4.1.1.4 “The nuclear
fuel cycle and related issues” and 1.4.1.1.6 “Decommissioning of nuclear
power plants”.

An ever-present nuclear safety procedure

EDF, in its capacity as a nuclear operator, takes responsibility for nuclear
safety and, in a rapidly-changing context (market competition, environmental
issues, etc.), reaffirms as its absolute priority the protection of human health
and the environment through the prevention of accidents and the limiting
of their consequences as regards nuclear safety, especially as the Codified
Law of 13 June 2006 on nuclear transparency and safety (see section 1.5
“Legislative and regulatory environment”) grants public access to information
regarding in particular the nuclear safety measures taken by the operator
and establishes a formal basis for transparency on nuclear safety.

The implementation of the French nuclear power programme led EDF to
establish a safety procedure that:

® takes into account, from the design stage, the risks that might arise
during the operation of the power plants, whether relating to the actual
operation of the facilities or to internal or external attacks;

® is based both on the application of strict rules of operation, and on the
cautious and inquiring attitude of the technical teams by means of the
establishment of a true safety culture;

® is based on the cumulative experience of a standardised fleet of
58 reactors (j.e., more than 1,700 reactor-years of operation (the
arithmetic sum of years of operation of EDF’s PWR power plants));

= incorporates a continuous improvement approach that is notably
embodied by the ongoing efforts to decrease the number of automatic
reactor trips;

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

= benefits from integrated nuclear engineering and Research &
Development within the Group in order to anticipate the correction of
failures, maintain the facilities in good working order, develop materials/
equipment on an ongoing basis, reassess safety margins and monitor
technology advances, as well as the implementation of more effective
new technologies and the management of sites being decommissioned;

™ relies strongly on the development of skills; with this objective in mind,
each nuclear generation site is equipped with a simulator used for training
‘to cope with any type of situation.

Nuclear safety is subject to numerous controls, both internal and external.
The external control of the safety of nuclear facilities in France is carried
out by the ASN.

At the national level, there are two types of audits:

m scheduled or unannounced regulatory inspections carried by the ASN
(473 inspections in 2015 over all EDF nuclear facilities);

™ aperiodic (ten-year) review process designed to improve the compliance
of operating nuclear plants with safety standards, and to reassess
these standards based on feedback and new knowledge. The targets
are established by the ASN which monitors compliance; EDF proposes
solutions to meet them and implements them after obtaining the approval
of the ASN (see section 1.4.1.1.1 “EDF's nuclear fleet”). The periodic
safety review is an important step in extending the operating life of
power plants (see sections 1.4.1.1.5 “Preparing for the future of the
nuclear fleet in France” and 1.5.6.2.2 “Specific regulations applicable
to basic nuclear facilities”).

At the international level, regular inspections are held making it possible to
share the experience gained worldwide:

m the OSART (Operational Safety Review Team) of the IAEA (International
Atomic Energy Agency) performs reviews at the request of the French
government with the objective of formulating recommendations and
promoting good working practices; in particular, the first Corporate
OSART of EDF was held in 2014 and concluded that EDF is fully compliant
with the standards defined by the IAEA;

= the international “peer review” inspections carried out by the WANO.
(World Association of Nuclear Operators) are organised at the request
of EDF to assess safety performance compared to best international
working practices.

EDF has also implemented internal control procedures. For example, every
three to four years, EDF performs overall safety assessments for each
nuclear power plant, which take place over a three-week period and
involve approximately 30 inspectors. In addition, the General Inspector
for nuclear safety and radiation protection, reporting to and appointed by
EDF's Chairman and CEO, performs annual audits to issue an opinion on
the overall safety of the nuclear fleet and suggests improvement actions to
the company’s management.

Efforts by EDF, notably to improve human performance, have resulted in a
reduction over the last few years of the annual average number of automatic
reactor trips. In 2015, they amounted to 38.

Warning system

In the event of an accident, a crisis plan is in place to limit impacts on the
environment and people, and to ensure the safety of the facility. This crisis
system is based on two closely coordinated plans, designed for both local
and national use. These are:

@ the Internal Emergency Plan, prepared by EDF; and

™ the Special Intervention Plan, prepared by French prefectures in
collaboration with the French government and EDF.

EDF | 2015 Reference Document 23


--- Page 13 ---

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

In order to provide greater effectiveness and thus improved protection
of populations, these plans in particular take into account external risks
(flooding, etc.) and internal risks (fire, etc.). The relevance of the system
for warning, informing and protecting people is regularly assessed through
accident simulation exercises. Each year, approximately 100 exercises are
organised for the entire French nuclear fleet, i.e., approximately one drill
every three days. Approximately ten exercises are on a national level, under
the management of the ASN and involve EDF and the public authorities, in
particular the prefectures. In 2015, 4 national-scale exercises were organised.

After its initial analyses following the Fukushima accident in March 2011,
EDF supplemented its crisis management organisation with a national team
capable of quickly delivering material and human assistance to a site in great
difficulty. This system, called the Nuclear Rapid Action Force (FARN), has had
many simulation exercises from regional bases located at Civaux, Paluel,
Dampierre and Bugey and can be sent to a unit at any site in difficulty. The
FARN is capable of a simultaneous response at six units on a single site.

Significant events regarding safety

The operational safety of nuclear facilities is taken into consideration from
the initial design stage, and is regularly monitored, together with the
implementation of an employee motivation policy and large-scale investment
programmes. The Group's nuclear safety policy is incorporated into training
for both EDF employees and subcontractors.

Control and surveillance

Nuclear safety is subject to internal controls (annual reviews, internal control
plans and nuclear inspection audits in France) and external controls (peer
reviews between corporate members of WANO and OSART, and audits
conducted by experts from the IAEA).

In France, the safety of nuclear facilities is controlled by the ASN. Events are
classified on a scale from 1 to 7, with 7 being the most serious (INES scale").
Incidents of no consequence for nuclear safety are classified as “deviations”
or “level 0 events”. Since the establishment of a scale of this kind in France
in 1987, no level 3 event (serious incident — very low external emission, and
exposure of the public representing a fraction of regulatory limits) or above
has occurred in the French nuclear fleet.

The ASN also approved the creation of an additional crisis management
system, the Nuclear Rapid Action Force (FARN) following additional safety
evaluations carried out by EDF after the Fukushima accident.

Results for 2015

As in 2014, no major safety or radiation protection event was recorded in
France in 2015 and, for the second consecutive year, the EDF group did
not experience a significant safety event (ESS) classified at INES 2 or higher.

Following on from the results obtained in 2014, the 2015 results were
relatively stable with an average of 1.16 level 1 event per reactor (i.e.
67 events) versus 1.14 a year earlier, and the average number of unclassified
events (level 0) falling to 8.88 ESS per reactor (j.e. 515 events), versus 9.66
in 2014. Since 2002, for its entire fleet, EDF has recorded a yearly total of at
most one level 2 event (incident with a significant failure in safety systems).

The number of automatic reactor trips was 0.66 per reactor (0.53 in 2014).

The 2015 detailed results on nuclear safety are published in the annual
report created by the General Inspector for Nuclear Safety and available
on the Internet.

Radiation protection

Work by field operatives has enabled continuous improvement of
performance in terms of protection of employees against the effects of
ionising radiation. Thus, the average annual collective dose of all workers,
both employees of EDF and outside companies intervening in power plants,
has been halved in less than ten years. In 2015, the average individual
dose was 0.71 man-Sievert per reactor (or a collective annual dose of
41.2 man-Sieverts in 2015). The collective dosimetry in 2015 is down
compared to 2014 (41.6 man-Sieverts). EDF is proactively implementing
an ALARA (As Low as Reasonably Achievable) policy to limit the collective
dose with a view to the workload involved in the industrial project on the
fleet in operation over the coming years.

EDF is furthermore committed to continuing to lower exposure to radiation
below the regulatory limit of 20mSv over 12 rolling months for the whole
body. Accordingly, throughout 2015 and over 12 rolling months, none of
the participants, neither EDF employees nor contractors, was exposed to
an individual dose of higher than 14mSv.

In the coming years, given the levels already achieved, efforts will have to
be focused on power plants with the poorest dosimetric results, in particular
by cleaning their circuits.

1.4.1.1.4 The nuclear fuel cycle and related issues

The average annual reference volume for nuclear fuel used by reactors in
the EDF fleet in France is approximately 1,200 tonnes (tonnes of heavy
metal: natural enriched uranium, enriched reprocessed uranium, plutonium),
of which approximately 1,050 tonnes corresponds to ENU fuel (enriched
natural uranium), 120 tonnes to MOX fuel (fuel produced from reprocessed
plutonium) and 30 tonnes to ERU fuel (enriched reprocessed uranium).

The nuclear fuel cycle encompasses all industrial operations in France and
abroad involved in the supply of fuel for energy generation in reactors, as
well as removal and processing of the fuel. The cycle can be broken down.
into three stages:

= front-end (upstream): the purchase of concentrates from uranium ore,
fluorination (or conversion), enrichment and production of fuel;

m_ the core cycle, corresponding to the use of fuel in the reactor: receipt,
loading, operation and unloading; the fuel stays four to five years in
the reactor;

® back-end (downstream), for the reactor fleet in France: interim pool
storage, reprocessing of spent fuel, conditioning of radioactive waste
and recycling of reusable materials, the intermediate storage of treated
waste prior to storage, as required by the French Law of 28 June 2006
on the sustainable management of radioactive materials and waste.

EDF coordinates all the operations in the fuel cycle. Generally speaking,
upstream and downstream operations are carried out by subcontractors
or suppliers, generally on the basis of multi-year contracts. EDF acquires
most of the raw materials as uranium concentrates (UO,). Transformation
into more processed products is carried out by industrial operators through
service contracts (fluorination, enrichment and manufacture), and provides
core cycle operations. EDF is the owner in most cases and is responsible for
the fuel and materials it uses throughout all different stages of the cycle.

Front-end (upstream)

To ensure the continuity and security of the supply of its reactors in France
and the UK, EDF retains overall control of all operations at each stage of
the cycle, through a portfolio of contacts and by stockpiling at different
stages of the front-end stage of the fuel cycle (natural uranium, fluorinated
enriched or unenriched uranium, and warehousing of new assemblies).

The AREVA group is in this respect an important supplier (see section 2.3
“Dependency factors”).

Natural uranium supply

Most of EDF's uranium supplies are guaranteed by long-term contracts for
periods of 7 to 20 years with a policy of diversification in terms of sources
and suppliers.

In 2015, EDF continued the securing of its long-term supplies with a number
of major market suppliers, including Kazatomprom.

In addition, EDF signed in February 2016 a uranium supply contract with
AREVA enhancing its coverage in the period beyond 2020.

Indexation formulas for portfolio contracts of natural uranium supply include

according to market price indexes) and are sometimes limited by floor and
ceiling prices. Consequently, the effects of upward variations in market
prices of natural uranium on supply costs are limited and smoothed out
while enabling to benefit from potential price decreases.

Fluorination (or conversion)

EDF's needs are covered by the Comurhex plant of the AREVA group, as well
as by other international producers, such as Cameco in Canada, Converdyn
in the United States and Tenex in Russia.

In February 2016, EDF signed a conversion services supply contract with
AREVA, to enhance coverage of its long-term needs.

Enriching natural uranium into uranium 235

With respect to supplies of enrichment services, EDF's needs have been
significantly covered by enrichers such as Urenco (UK, Germany, the
Netherlands, United States) and Tenex (Russia), primarily through fixed-price
contracts, decreasing on a constant currency basis.

In February 2016, EDF signed an agreement with AREVA that helps secure
its long-term supplies.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Enriched reprocessed uranium

Since the 1990s, reprocessing has made it possible to recycle within the
reactors all or part of the uranium from processing spent fuel, which
represents approximately 95% of the spent fuel mass.

This reprocessing was suspended in 2013, given the lack of economic
incentive in light of the significant oversupply of natural uranium and pending
the availability of a new industrial scheme. EDF is currently examining the
conditions for restarting reprocessing by 2020.

Reprocessed uranium is stored in a stable form to be used at a later stage.

Fuel assembly manufacturing

Contracts with the fuel assembly manufacturers AREVA NP and
Westinghouse, covering most of EDF's needs, were renewed in 2014 to
secure provisions at least until 2020.

Back-end (downstream)

EDF is responsible for what happens to its spent fuel and how it is processed
and for the related waste, without any possibility of transfer of responsibility
or limitation in time. AREVA is responsible for processing and ANDRA for
the management of the long-term storage of final waste, in accordance
with the Codified Law of 28 June 2006 on the long-term management of
radioactive materials and waste.

EDF's current strategy for the nuclear fuel cycle, in agreement with the
French government, is to process spent fuel and recycle the plutonium
separated in this process in the form of MOX fuel. The quantities handled
are determined by the amount of recycled plutonium in reactors allowed to
load MOX fuel (“equal flows principle”). The recycling capacity of nuclear
units in the French fleet has allowed the processing of up to 1,100 tonnes
of spent fuel per year.

Processing of spent fuel from EDF's nuclear power stations

Spent fuel awaiting processing is temporarily stored underwater in cooling
pools, first in pools at the plants and subsequently in those of AREVA’s
reprocessing plant at La Hague. The storage conditions are recognised as
being safe over long time periods. Approximately ten years after the spent
UO, fuel has been unloaded from the reactor, it is processed to separate the
recyclable products from waste. The waste is subsequently conditioned and
temporarily stored at the La Hague site in specific premises.

The relationship between EDF and AREVA concerning the transport,
processing and recycling of spent fuel was formalised for the 2008-2040
period by a framework agreement signed on 19 December 2008.

In May 2015, EDF and AREVA signed an implementation agreement covering
the 2013-2015 period. In February 2016, EDF and AREVA also signed an
implementation agreement covering the 2016-2023 period as well as the
associated supply contracts for the MOX assemblies.

Storing conditioned ultimate waste

Radioactive waste, depending on its nature, level of radioactivity and the
lifespan of its radionuclide components, has been classified into different
categories: from High-Level Waste (HLW), to Very Low-Level Waste (VLLW)
passing by Low-Level Waste (LLW) and Intermediate-Level Waste (ILW). It
is called Long-Lived (LL) when it remains active for more than 30 years.

Long-Lived High-Level Waste (HLW-LL)

The processing of spent fuel enables the vitrification of HLW-LL, which
provides very high-quality conditioning with a reduced volume. The waste
is then temporarily stored at La Hague in specific facilities. All of the
Long-Lived High-Level Waste produced in this way, corresponding to the
operation of the early Natural Uranium Gas Graphite plants (NUGG) and to

26 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

40 years of operation of the current PWR facilities, will represent a volume
of approximately 6,700 cubic metres (see note 29 to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 in section 6).

Long-Lived Intermediate-Level Waste (ILW-LL)

The structures of the assemblies (shells and nozzles, clad pieces, etc.)
separated during the processing of spent fuel, constitute ILW-LL. They are
currently compacted and conditioned in stainless steel containers. The total
volume of ILW-LL, including the waste resulting from the operation of the
NUGG fleet and that resulting from 40 years of operating the current PWR
fleet, will be approximately 37,000 cubic metres. Unlike HLW-LL, it does not
generate heat and thus is suitable for faster storage than HLW-LL because
it does not require cooling.

HLW-LL and ILW-LL from the reprocessing of spent fuel is temporarily
stored in dedicated facilities in La Hague, pending decisions on storage in
deep geological layers, as is currently envisaged as part of ANDRA‘s Centre
industriel de stockage géologique (Cigéo) project.

Long-Lived Low-Level Waste (LLW-LL)

LLW-LL comes from the decommissioning of the old NUGG reactors (graphite,
processing waste — see section 1.4.1.1.6 “Decommissioning of nuclear power
plants”). Given its lifespan, this waste cannot be stored in existing surface
facilities (see below), but due to its lower level of activity than that of Long-
Lived High- and Intermediate-Level Waste, the Law of 28 June 2006 provides
for special subsurface storage. In July 2015, ANDRA issued the progress
report on the 2013-2015 national plan for themManagement of radioactive
materials and waste. This report contains the safety assessment associated
with the various sub-surface components in the area under investigation
(communauté de communes de Soulaines). For graphite waste, the results
open up the possibility to storage on the site investigated.

Short-Lived Low- and Intermediate-Level Waste (LILW-SL)
and Very-Low-Level Waste (VLLW)

Short-Lived Low- and Intermediate-Level Waste comes from nuclear facilities
(gloves, filters, resins, etc.) and from their decommissioning (concrete,
scrap, lagging, piping, etc.). It is stored on the surface at the Soulaines and
Morvilliers storage facilities managed by ANDRA, and its radioactivity is very
close to natural radioactivity.

In order to minimise volumes, some waste is treated beforehand by melting
or incineration at the Centraco plant owned by SOCODEI, a subsidiary of EDF.

Consideration of future charges relating to the management
of spent fuel and long-term management of radioactive waste

Each year, EDF makes provisions for the downstream side of the nuclear
fuel cycle in France (see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2015 in section 6).

1.4.1.1.5 Preparing for the future of the nuclear fleet
in France

EDF's industrial goal for the preparation for the future of the nuclear fleet

rests primarily on the following strategic areas:

m the implementation of technical conditions for the extension of the
operational lifespan of nuclear power plants beyond 40 years;

= continued safety improvements, primarily by integrating lessons learned
from the Fukushima accident in Japan;

= implementation of a preventive policy with respect to ageing or obsolete
equipment.


--- Page 16 ---

Continued operation of the operating units well
beyond 40 years

Additional Safety Assessments (ASA) following the Fukushima
accident

On 15 September 2011 and in light of the accident at the Fukushima nuclear
plant in Japan, EDF submitted 19 Additional Safety Assessment reports to
the ASN, one for each of its nuclear sites, encompassing all its existing
reactors and all those under construction.

These assessments consisted of re-examining the defences of existing
power plants and those under construction, in light of the events in Japan,
taking into account issues set out in the specifications drafted by the safety
authorities. Thus, the safety margins were reassessed against the risks of
earthquakes and flooding, when dealing with situations of simultaneous loss
of the cooling source and power supplies and the consequences of severe
accidents. These assessments also led to inquire whether certain changes to
the scenarios planned beyond situations used for the sizing of the protection
systems, would lead to a worsening of the consequences in terms of safety
(“cliff effects”) and finally to deterministically consider the extreme situations
that substantially exceed those used in the design of nuclear installations
and subsequent safety reviews. The safety of EDF's nuclear fleet is based
on the principle of continuous improvement: existing and new facilities
continuously benefit from feedback from all power plants, and lessons are
learnt from incidents and accidents that may occur in the world.

Finally, the ASAs also re-examined the rules applied in outsourcing.

These analyses confirmed first and foremost the adequate level of security
throughout the EDF nuclear power fleet, particularly because of the periodic
safety reviews carried out in France since the end of the 1980s and codified
by the Law on nuclear transparency and safety (the “TSN Law”) in June 2006,
and codified later in the French Environmental Code. EDF also proposed
additional measures to the ASN that exceed those considered for sizing
safety systems, to contribute to further improving the current safety level
of power plants.

In its opinion to the government published on 3 January 2012, the ASN
states, on the basis of the analyses of its technical support, that “after the
additional safety assessments on priority nuclear facilities, the ASN considers
that the facilities examined show an adequate level of safety, and that it will
not thus request the immediate shutdown of any of them”. At the same
time, the ASN considers that “continuing to operate these facilities requires
increasing their robustness, as soon as possible, to an extent beyond existing
safety margins, to handle extreme situations”.

The ASN also recommended the “hard core” concept and the FARN system.
(see section 1.4.1.1.3 “Environment, nuclear safety, radiation protection”).
The “hard core” will be made up of the plant's structures, systems and
components that can withstand situations studied in connection with ASAs.
On 26 June 2012, the ASN made 19 decisions requiring EDF to follow over
600 technical requirements, which set regulatory requirements according
to the post-Fukushima action plan. These technical rules require that all
nuclear sites must have an organisation and local crisis centres resistant to the
occurrence of a large-scale event affecting several facilities. For EDF power
plants, the prescribed “hard core” must in particular have “bunkerised”
electrical resources in each unit, which must be installed before 2018. In
the meantime, a temporary back-up diesel generator was installed at each
of the 58 units in 2013. The complete definition of the “hard core” was
covered in technical rules issued by the ASN in January 2014.

Operating life of EDF's PWR fleet

The provisions of the French Environmental Code do not set a limit on
operating life, but require a safety review of the facilities every ten years in
light of best international practices (“safety standards”).

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

As part of the studies related to the third ten-year inspections of the SOOMW
series, in early July 2009 the ASN publicly stated that it had not identified a
generic problem that called into question EDF's ability to control the safety
of its SOOMW reactors for up to 40 years. The ASN's general opinion is
supplemented by a decision on each reactor.

At end-2015, 27 of the 34 900MW units had passed their third ten-year
inspection. Nine of these (Fessenheim 1 & 2, Bugey 2, 4 &5, Tricastin 1, 2
& 3 and Dampierre 1) have completed the process of exchanging information
with the ASN (the ASN’s opinion and technical rules have been received).
For all reactors, EDF has or will carry out the work required by the ASN
pursuant to these prescriptions.

EDF's industrial strategy is to operate the fleet beyond 40 years in the best
conditions of safety and performance, particularly in view of the significant
investment linked to the third ten-year inspections on the one hand and to
post-Fukushima improvements on the other. This target is consistent with
trends observed around the world for reactors using similar technologies.
To this end, EDF has implemented industrial and R&D action plans. Actions
have been launched to renew the major components that can be renewed
(see section 1.4.1.1.2. “Operation and technical performance of the nuclear
fleet"), and solutions are being studied to demonstrate the capacity of non-
replaceable equipment such as the confinement vaults and reactor vessels,
to ensure their operation up to 60 years.

Concerning safety improvements to carry out to extend the operating life
of units beyond 40 years, the ASN indicated that it would issue, following
the April 2015 meeting of the Permanent Strategic Decisions Group, an
initial position on the major strategic decisions of the safety review relating
to the fourth series of ten-year inspections of the 900MW reactors and a
final position in 2018-2019 on the “generic” phase of this review, the final
authorisation for use beyond 40 years being made on a reactor by reactor
basis. On 20 April 2016, the ASN sent a letter to EDF in which it defines
its expectations to authorize a potential lifetime extension of the 900MW
French nuclear reactors. After reviewing the file delivered by EDF’s group
in which it presents its approach and its methodology to extend the use
of 34 reactors of this technology beyond 40 years, the ASN considers that
the topics selected by EDF in its programme respond to safety issues and
do not call any comments. However, the ASN asked EDF to complete its
programme on several aspects, including the scope of control programme
and the goals of investigation improvements.

An extension to the lifespan of the current nuclear fleet would enable,
whilst respecting the absolute priority of nuclear safety and as part of
the multi-year energy programme (see section 1.4.1.1.2 “Operation and
technical performance of the nuclear fleet”), better use of the industrial
base it represents, the deferral of financial flows associated with decisions
for investment in new plants beyond 2025 and the spreading of the
commissioning of new plants over time.

1.4.1.1.6 Decommissioning of nuclear power plants

EDF takes full regulatory, financial and technical responsibility for the
decommissioning of its plants, the challenge being to demonstrate, through
the decommissioning process, its control of the entire life cycle of the means.
of nuclear power generation.

The reference scenario adopted by EDF since 2001 is for decommissioning
without a waiting period, consistent with French regulations, which provide
for decommissioning “in as short a time as possible on acceptable economic
terms and in line with the principles set out in Article L. 1333-2 of the
French Public Health Code and Article L. 110-1 Il of this Code” (see Article
L. 593-25 of the French Environment Code).

EDF | 2015 Reference Document 27


--- Page 17 ---

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

The regulatory process for decommissioning is governed by the French
Environment Code and Decree 2007-1557 of 2 November 2007 (see
section 1.5.6.2.2 “Specific regulations applicable to basic nuclear facilities”).
It is characterised, for a given site, by:

= ashutdown declaration at least two years prior to the planned shutdown
date;

= a decommissioning request resulting, following examination by
the authorities and a public inquiry, in a single decree allowing for
decommissioning;

m key progress reviews with the ASN, included in a safety reference system
relative to dismantling;

= aninternal authorisation procedure for the operator, independent of the
operational staff and audited by the ASN, allowing work to be started
within the authorised safety reference limits;

= finally, once the work has been completed, the declassification of the
facility to remove it from the legal regime governing basic nuclear facilities.

Decommissioning of shut down power plants

Concerning power plants that have been shut down (a pressurised water
reactor (PWR), Chooz A; a heavy water reactor (HWR), Brennilis; a fast-
neutron reactor (FNR), Creys-Malville; and six graphite-gas-moderated
reactors (NUGG) in Bugey, Saint-Laurent and Chinon), EDF has chosen to
fully decommission them as soon as possible in line with the principles of the
French Public Health Code and the French Environment Code while ensuring
that the technical risks associated with these activities are managed. The
sites remain the property of EDF, and they will remain under its responsibility
and monitoring.

Given its role as responsible owner, EDF will act as the contracting authority
for the decommissioning.

The decommissioning of EDF's nine first-generation units in final shutdown
will produce approximately one million tonnes of primary waste materials,
of which 80% is standard waste material and none is High-Level Waste. The
remaining 20% comprises Very-Low to Intermediate-Level Waste including
about 2% Long-Lived Waste requiring the availability of a storage facility
for ILW-LL (Cigéo deep geological storage plan) and long-lived LLW-LL.

Existing means for removal of short-lived VLLW and LILW removal will be
supplemented by:

™ the project to build a packaging and intermediate storage facility for
radioactive waste (Installation de conditionnement et d’entreposage
des déchets activés, or ICEDA), under construction at the Bugey site.
Mid-2017 has been set as the target commissioning date for this facility;

™ the LLW-LL storage centre provided for by the Law of 28 June 2006
concerning the long-term sustainable management of radioactive
materials and waste. Following an unsuccessful initial site search by
ANDRA in 2008, and the sending of a report to the government at end-
2012, in 2013 ANDRA restarted the search and in July 2015 issued the
progress report on the 2013-2015 National Plan for the Management
of Radioactive Materials and Waste (see section 1.4.1.1.4 “The nuclear
fuel cycle and related issues”). This report contains the safety assessment
associated with the various sub-surface components in an area under
investigation. For graphite waste, the results open up the possibility to
storage on the site investigated.

The decommissioning process for the Chooz A and Creys-Malville plants
continues. Chooz A is a pressurised water reactor using a technology similar
to the 58 units in operation, but of an older design. The reactor location in
arocky cave in a hillside means that access conditions and entry and exit of
materials are more difficult than those of the rest of the existing PWR fleet.

Regarding Brennilis, pursuant to a 2008' agreement with the CEA, EDF has
become fully responsible for its decommissioning. The decommissioning

work included in the scope of the original decree is in progress. However,
the final and complete dismantling work should be allowed by an additional
decree that EDF applied for on 29 December 2011. In accordance with the
opinion that the ASN had expressed, the Mission for Nuclear Security and
Radiation Protection notified EDF in December 2012 that the request for
authorisation for full decommissioning of Brennilis could not be pursued in
its current state due to the cancellation of the ICEDA building permit (see
section 2.4.1 “Legal proceedings concerning EDF”). The decision of the
Administrative Court of Appeal in Lyon of 4 December 2014, by restoring
the validity of the ICEDA building permit, led EDF to relaunch the study of a
file on the complete dismantling of Brennilis, taking into consideration any
new regulations arising since the creation of the previous file, in particular
the application of the INB reglementation.

As for the six NUGG reactors, EDF's decommissioning programme involves
directly removing graphite from these power plants to its storage facility in
‘the Aube (CSA). The decommissioning schedule has been adapted from the
schedule of availability of the storage centre by the ANDRA.

Decommissioning costs

EDF nuclear power plants

Since the beginning of operations at its power plants, EDF has made
provisions to cover decommissioning operations, engineering, monitoring and
maintenance of facilities, and site security (see section 6.1 “EDF's consolidated
financial statements”, notes 29.1.3 and 29.1.5 to the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015).

An international comparison conducted by the OECD in late 2003 showed
that EDF's estimates are consistent with the estimates made by other
countries. With the exception of a few specific cases (Sweden, Japan), the
costs considered by each party are actually fairly similar, with France at
10% to 15% below the average, mainly explained by the series effect that
can be reasonably expected from the decommissioning of the PWR fleet.

Furthermore, EDF relies on national and international feedback (OCDE,
AIEA, European Union, etc.), taking account of the following elements:

= differences in the estimate scopes;

= national and regulatory contexts;

= difficulties in comparing estimates in different monetary units;
@ the irrelevance of using a comparison based on €/kWe.

EDF's benchmarking shows that the estimate of dismantling costs of French
power plants is in the upper end of the funded costs range.

These benchmark elements were audited as part of the audit commissioned
by the DGEC (General Division for Energy and Climate - Direction Générale
de |’Energie et du Climat) on the decommissioning costs of pressurized
water reactors (PWR), conducted between July 2014 and August 2015.
The main conclusions are:

® overall, the audit supports the estimate of EDF for the dismantling cost
of its nuclear fleet;

m the auditors confirmed that restatements are required to make
international comparisons, and that direct comparison of cost expressed
in € per installed kWe is inappropriate;

m the auditors conducted an independent comparison in men/year that
reflects the cost of dismantling, as manpower is a major factor in this
activity, and is not sensitive to monetary effects. In terms of international
benchmarking, the DGEC audit concluded that the men/year amounts
converge when adjustments to homogenize the scope are performed,
and that the French quote offers the highest estimate of overall needs.

1. With this agreement, the CEA has become fully responsible for the decommissioning of Phénix.

28 EDF | 2015 Reference Document


--- Page 18 ---

Third-party facilities: La Hague (AREVA) and Phénix (CEA)

As the responsibility for the decommissioning of facilities is incumbent on
their operator, EDF wished to free itself financially from these operations.

As such, the agreements signed with AREVA in July 2010 and the CEA in
late 2008 clarified the financial responsibilities of the parties. Following
a cash payment, EDF was released from any obligation to finance the
decommissioning of the Phénix power plant, which has been shut down,
and the La Hague power plant.

1.4.1.1.7 Assets available to cover long-term nuclear
commitments (outside the operating cycle)

Dedicated assets have been gradually accumulated since 1999 to cover
long-term nuclear commitments. Article L. 594 of the French Environment
Code and its implementing laws defined provisions that are not associated
with the operating cycle and must therefore be covered by dedicated assets
(see section 6.1 “EDF's consolidated financial statements”, note 47.5 to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015).

1.4.1.2 New Nuclear projects

1.4.1.2.1 Organisation

2015 saw the establishment of the New Nuclear Projects and Engineering
Department, part of EDF group's CAP 2030 strategy which sets out the
strategy for the future.

This department brings together the engineering units that play a role in the
preparation of the reactors of the future, ongoing construction projects and
supporting the operating fleet. It encompasses the Groups key priorities:

= improving the performance of nuclear new build projects (primarily
Flamanville 3 and Hinkley Point C);

= preparing the reactors of the future;

= working more closely with the AREVA teams in order to increase efficiency.

1.4.1.2.2 Update on the Flamanville EPR project

Architect-assembler engineering

To complete the Flamanville 3 EPR (European Pressurized water Reactor)
project, EDF is performing the architect-assembler role itself; this matches
the position adopted by EDF in the development, renovation and
decommissioning of its power generation assets and is based on its internal
engineering capabilities. This role allows direct control of the design and
operation of its power plants, the organisation of development projects,
the schedule and costs of construction, its relations with the ASN and the
direct integration of operating feedback.

Interactions with the Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN)

EDF filed a request for authorisation to commission Flamanville 3 in
March 2015 with the ASN, which acknowledged receipt in June and
began the technical examination of the dossier, while identifying additional
necessary information.

At the same time, EDF also filed a request for authorisation for partial
commissioning with the ASN in March 2015 designed to authorise delivery
of fuel to the site, which is also being examined.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES

In addition, EDF sent in October 2015 the French Ministry of the Environment,
Sustainable Development and Energy a request to extend to April 2020
the deadline for commissioning Flamanville 3 as specified in the building
authorisation Decree of 10 April 2007, the initial period of validity being
10 years from 2007.

Supply and work contracts

Nearly 70% of the construction budget represented by the six main contracts
(boiler, civil engineering, control systems, piping, generator - condenser -
water station, electricity) were, with the exception of the boiler contract
signed with AREVA, awarded following international calls for tender.

Equipment manufacturing

The manufacture of the equipment required for construction is now well
advanced. Most of the equipment for the nuclear section was available in
2015, except for a certain number of valves and security-classified equipment
to meet regulations of nuclear equipment under pressure (ESPN) whose
acceptance criteria are under discussion by the manufacturer and the ASN.

A programme of further testing to demonstrate the compliance of the
reactor vessel and lid was approved by the ASN. In addition, the technical
examination of the evaluation of the pressuriser valves is ongoing (final tests
for the evaluation of the design and durability testing of the valve to be done).

Work on site

Several important steps of the construction of the Flamanville 3 reactor
were completed in 2014 and 2015, marking the progressive transition of
the project towards the testing phases:

= civil engineering finished (completion of concreting for the internal and
external domes of the reactor building and prestressing operations);

= four boiler units brought in and primary circuit assembled;

m= the command room of the EPR commissioned, the first in service for
an EPR reactor;

= first system tests of the pumping station (in particular filtration) and
in the machine room (including the lubrication system of the turbine
shaft column);

® installation of the unit's command-control system on site, for overall
system tests;

= water immersion and test of the pools in the nuclear island, in particular
in the fuel building;

m= the main diesel motors brought in and assembly commenced, as well
for the final emergency diesel motors;

® first liquid tests of the cooling circuit in the nuclear island;

= first concrete poured for the local crisis centre of the Flamanville site
(units 1-2-3), French first-in-series for this type of building following
post-Fukushima recommendations that will be built at each French
nuclear generation site.

At the end of 2015, electromechanical assemblies had significantly progressed
(65%), and the test phase was launched on site, for the conventional island
and for the nuclear island.

On 24 March 2016, the Group announced the achievement of the 1st
milestone, with finalisation of the primary circuit mechanical erection (see
section 5.2 “Subsequent events”).

Commissioning schedule and budget

In September 2015, EDF released a new schedule and revised construction
costs for the Flamanville 3 project of €,.,,10.5 billion.

= first fuel loading and start-up of the reactor in the fourth quarter of 2018.

1.4.1.2.3 Progress on other New Nuclear Projects

1.4.1.2.3.1 Hinkley Point C EPR

On 21 October 2015, EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corporation
(CGN) signed a non-binding strategic investment agreement in London for
the construction and operation of the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear
power plant in Somerset. This will enable the project to move forward and
lay the groundwork for a final investment decision, which remains subject
in particular to the following conditions:

= approval by the Boards of Directors of EDF and of CGN;

® finalisation of all the contractual documentation based on the agreements
of 21 October 2015.

The approvals from competition authorities under the control of
concentrations and other governmental authorities in China and Europe
were obtained in the first quarter 2016.

EDF Energy also signed two other non-binding agreements with CGN relating
to two nuclear construction projects in the United Kingdom: Sizewell C and
Bradwell B (see section 1.4.5.1.2.5 “Nuclear New Build Division”).

1.4.1.2.3.2 Memorandum of understanding with AREVA

On 30 July 2015, EDF and Areva signed a non-binding memorandum of
understanding that formalised the status of the progress of discussions
concerning their contemplated partnership. This memorandum has
3 sections:

= EDF's acquisition of an exclusive control of AREVA NP. In this regard, EDF
would take majority control of AREVA NP (at least 51%), AREVA would
have a maximum stake of 25% as part of a strategic partnership, and
the potential participation of other minority partners. This project enables

to better secure the most critical activities of the “Grand carénage” for
the existing fleet in France, and to improve the efficiency of engineering
services, project management, and some manufacturing activities through
EDF's experience feedback;

m the creation of a dedicated company, 80% owned by EDF and 20%
by AREVA NP, aimed at optimising the design and management of
new reactors projects. The purpose of this company is to improve the
preparation and management of projects as well as the export offering of
the French industry by improving the coordination of strategic marketing
to draw up offers in the upstream project phase, by developing offers that
are more competitive and adapted to client needs, and by harmonising
and expanding the range of reactors, all while ensuring the continuation
of partnerships with the major industrial companies in Japan and China.
This company will form part of an integrated generator/supplier model,
which has been tried and tested in several countries;

m the signing of a strategic and overall industrial partnership, encompassing
for example the promotion of integrated offers (fuel assemblies and
material) in the case of the sale of new reactors for export, cooperation
in the field of decommissioning (methods, tools, expertise, etc.) and in
the intermediate storage of spent fuel (joint export offers), further studies
into 4" generation reactors (boiler and fuel) and cooperation in R&D.

Atits meeting held on 27 January 2016, following due diligence conducted
during the second half of 2015, EDF Board of Directors reviewed the outcome
of discussions with AREVA regarding the acquisition by EDF of exclusive
control of AREVA NP activities.

The Board agreed on the final valuation of the operations to be acquired
by EDF, which comes to €2.5 billion for 100% of AREVA NP‘s share
capital’. This amount is likely to be adjusted, firstly, upward or downward
depending on the financial statements prepared on the date of completion
of the transaction, and secondly, with a possible price earn-out of up to
€350 million, subject to the achievement of certain performance objectives
measured after the closing date. This €2.5 billion valuation corresponds to
a valuation of 8 times the normalised EBITDA.

With a contemplated EDF participation of between 51% and 75%, EDF
will be in a position to make a binding offer, after consultation with the
Central Works Council and authorisation by the Board of Directors, once
‘the arrangements to completely immunise EDF against the costs and risks
of the OL3 project and all the final contractual documentation are finalised.

1.4.1.2.3.3 Taishan EPR

EDF is a shareholder in TNPJVC (Taishan Nuclear Power Joint Venture
Company Limited), which was set up to build and operate two EPR nuclear
reactors in Taishan, in the province of Guangdong in China.

In 2015, unit 1 moved into test phase and unit 2 into mass assembly phase.
The following milestones were achieved in 2015:

m July 2015: completion of concreting of the external dome of unit 1;

m= September 2015: completion of the vessel mould block for unit 1;

= November 2015: first start of one of the four main diesel motors for
unit 1 and completion of concreting of the external dome of unit 2;

m end December 2015: start of the hydropower test of the primary circuit
of unit 1.

The project momentum will continue in 2016 with ongoing testing of all of
unit 1 and the assemblies of unit 2 with a view to moving into the test phase.

Within EDF, structures were put in place to provide the Taishan project with
‘technical support from EDF and to draw on the experience of these activities.

1.4.1.2.3.4 EPR New Model

In early 2015, EDF and AREVA jointly launched the “EPR New Model”
(EPR NM) project designed to develop the basic design for a new third-
generation nuclear reactor — an improvement on the EPR — that incorporates
lessons from ongoing projects.

EDF and AREVA decided to develop the project together, as part of an
integrated plan, to make the most of the synergies that exist between the
two engineering firms.

The design of this new reactor is based on the EPR one and will satisfy the
third-generation safety goals. It will be the first reactor to incorporate from
initial design phase the lessons of the Fukushima accident and the resulting
new international and French safety standards.

The EPR NM project aims to optimise this reactor on the basis of lessons
learnt from ongoing projects and construction. To achieve this goal, three
types of levers are employed:

® the incorporation, very early in development, of industrial aspects to take
full advantage of the nuclear industry's industrial base;

= the development of methods and tools to make the engineering teams
more efficient;

= the optimisation of some of the EPR’s technical options.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES

The EPR NM model is intended to play a role in the renewal of the nuclear
fleet currently operating in France and to enhance the nuclear industry's
export business.

1.4.1.3 Thermal generation in mainland France

EDF's electricity generation from its thermal power plants in mainland
France represented approximately 1.5% of its total electricity generation in
2015. This fleet, which has an average age of 24 years, had a total installed
operating capacity of 9,970MW.

Thermal generation assets have a number of advantages: they are very
responsive and flexible (quick to start up and power can be modulated),
they can be stopped for extended periods (set aside) or they can go back
into operation at short notice, they have relatively low investment costs and
short construction times.

Furthermore, the most modern thermal plants meet the environmental
requirements of the latest directives in force.

Thermal generation assets are one of the key components of the energy
mix to ensure the balance of generation and consumption in real time and
to accommodate fluctuations in electricity consumption. Together with
some hydropower facilities (lakes, pumped storage plants), they are used
to meet mid-merit and peak demand electricity requirements. They also
play an important role in adjusting EDF’s generation capacities in response
to changes in its customers’ needs.

1.4.1.3.1 EDF’s thermal generation fleet

At 31 December 2015, the thermal generation facilities operated by EDF were of different types, both in terms of fuel and power:

Unit Number of units Total Year commissioned Output (in TWh)

1.4.1.3.2 Issues relating to thermal generation

Updating of the most recent coal-fired generating units
to meet mid-merit load capacity demand

For mid-merit load capacity, maintaining the most recent (i.e., the most
efficient) coal-fired units is the best solution to ensure availability of
competitive capacities.

In particular, the most recent 600MW coal-fired units benefit from the
lowest fuel costs of all of the thermal generation facilities (better efficiency,
seaside units, and large capacity sites). Their power, along with the flexibility
of their generation, are essential advantages. They are equipped with flue
gas desulphurisation and denitrification systems (90% reduction in sulphur
dioxide emissions and 80% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions), as well
as dust collectors that trap virtually all the dust. These processes enable the
units to comply with environmental restrictions applicable since 2008, as
well as to meet new regulatory requirements to be implemented from 2015.

EDF | 2015 Reference Document 31


--- Page 21 ---

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

A renovation programme for these coal-fired units is currently in progress,
with the aim of improving their reliability and efficiency.

However, due to environmental regulation constraints (see section 1.5.6.2.3
“Regulations applicable to thermal energy generation”), EDF completed the
final shutdown of its oldest coal-fired fleet, with the shutdown of the last
five units in 2015 (La Maxe 1 & 2, Vitry-sur-Seine 3 & 4 and Bouchain 1).
Overall, since 2013, EDF has shut down 2,835MW of coal-fired plants.

Optimisation of the oil-fired fleet through seasonal
shutdowns

To reflect the very low usage of oil-fired plants, EDF has carried out since
2014 a seasonal shutdown of this fleet (guaranteed long-term shutdown)
from April to October.

EDF also decided to permanently shut down the thermal plant in Aramon on
1 April 2016, this plant scarcely being used over the past number of years.

Commissioning of a combustion turbine centralised remote
control centre

Since April 2015, the thermal fleet combustion turbines have been run
from a remote control centre based in Vaires-sur-Marne, headquarters of
the Combustion Turbine Operation Centre. This innovative system enables
the remote control of the 13 turbines spread across six generation sites:
4 in ile-de-France and 2 in Brittany.

Modernising the thermal generation fleet with natural gas
combined cycle turbines

In 2011, EDF commissioned a first natural gas combined cycle turbine (GCCT)
in France on the Blénod site, followed by a first combined-cycle turbine in
Martigues in 2012 and a second in 2013. The GCCTs in Martigues are the
result of the repowering of former oil-fired units, a part of whose facilities,
such as the steam turbine, the condenser and the water treatment facilities,
were reused. The repowering of a unit of this capacity is a first in Europe.
The installed capacity of the Martigues site is 930MW and the return is
over 50%, markedly higher than the return from traditional thermal units.
This modernisation of the thermal generation fleet enables EDF to reduce
atmospheric emissions of CO,, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides.

On the Bouchain site, EDF is building, in partnership with General Electric,
a next-generation GCCT, equipped with the new General Electric high-
capacity turbine, the “9HA”. This combined cycle turbine, with innovative
characteristics in terms of capacity (575MW achievable in less than 30
minutes) and return (61% versus average return for a standard GCCT of 57
to 58%), offering good environmental performance with CO, emissions of on
average around 360g/KWh, 55% below those of the old neighbouring coal-
fired plant shut down in 2015, is expected to be commissioned in summer
2016. The prototype will be tested for two years and then transferred to
EDF, provided that the tests are conclusive.

Evolution of the environmental regulatory framework

Today, EDF's thermal power plants are operated within the context of
regulations that apply to installations classified for environmental protection
purposes (/nstallations classées pour la protection de I‘environnement, or
ICPE), as well as regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions and a
specific regulation for air quality (see section 1.5.6.1 “Basic regulations
applicable to the environment, health, hygiene and safety”). EDF set itself

The oil-fired units use fuel with an ultra-low sulphur content (less than 0.4% sulphur)
Within the Company's scope (EDF SA, i.e. including SEI and excluding PE)), total emissions amounted to 6.7 million tonnes in 2015.
Renewable, or “green” energies, are derived from natural resources that are replenished quickly enough to be considered non-depletable in human terms.

the goal of cutting CO, emissions in mainland France by 30% (measured in
tonnes) between 1990 and 2020, and of cutting SO,, NO, and dust emissions
by at least 65% between 2005 and 2020 (see section 1.5 “Legislative and
regulatory environment”).

Thanks to the shutdown of the oldest thermal power plants, the updating of
‘the most recent plants, the implementation of pollution-reducing procedures,
the use of low sulphur fuel’ and lastly the commissioning of natural gas
combined cycle turbines, the environmental performance of the thermal
fleet in mainland France has improved significantly:

m total CO, emissions of the EDF fleet in 2015 came to 5.3 million tonnes?,
thereby confirming the improvement in the carbon footprint with CO,
emissions down over 50% since 1990;

= The NO, and dust emission targets set for 2020 have already been
achieved. SO, emissions have fallen by close to 55% since 2005, and it
should be possible to achieve the 2020 target in the near future.

1.4.1.3.3 Generation and technical performance

Thermal generation accounted for 6.8TWh in 2015. It represents about
1.5% of EDF's 2015 generation in mainland France.

The reliability of all components of the thermal generation fleet was
confirmed in 2015 and is in line with European standards. The response rate
achieved by combustion turbines to requests from optimisation services was
very good. Minimising unplanned outages is the essential aim for facilities
such as thermal plants, used for mid-merit and peak generation. The priority
for these means of generation required on a variable basis all year round is
‘to ensure system security by ensuring maximum reliability and availability. In
2015, coal units supplied 4.6TWh, GCCT plants supplied 2.0TWh, oil-fired
units 131GWh and combustion turbines 101GWh.

The Martigues site was hit by a fire on 5 February 2015, which damaged
unit 6, in particular the steam turbine, and caused collateral damage to
unit 5. Unit 5 came back into service in June 2015, and unit 6 is scheduled
‘to come back into service during the second quarter of 2016. Rehabilitation
costs for EDF should be limited, fire being covered by insurance.

Decommissioning of the existing fleet

EDF has planned all of the decommissioning operations for its existing thermal
generation facilities. The provisions for these operations have been made
in an amount that corresponds to the cost of decommissioning all of the
units being operated and the clean-up of the sites (see section 6.1 “EDF's
consolidated financial statements”, note 30 to the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015).

In 2015, EDF continued the decommissioning work on sites that have been
definitively shut down.

1.4.1.4 Generation from renewable energies

Renewable energies? (hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, marine
energy, etc.), have seen robust growth worldwide.

The combined installed onshore wind capacity totalled worldwide 420GW at
the end of 2015, almost 74GW of which was in the US and around 137GW
in Europe. In 2015, more than 60GW of wind energy was commissioned
worldwide, including around 30GW in China‘.


--- Page 22 ---

In solar photovoltaic power, total global installed capacity stood at close
to 242GWp at the end of 2015, of which nearly 56GWp was from new
capacity built in 20151.

Today, it is largely wind, solar and biomass that are driving growth in
renewable energy. Hydropower generation is nearing its maximum potential
in many developed countries, although it retains significant development
potential in other parts of the globe (of the 111GW of new renewable
capacity development expected worldwide each year, around a quarter is
hydropower capacity).

The EDF group is now the leading producer of renewable energies in Europe
and specifically the leading supplier of hydropower in the European Union;
hydropower represents the Group's leading renewable energy, with an
installed capacity of 2OGW, 239 dams, 436 production sites worldwide).
The Group plays a role in the rise of competitive sectors, particularly wind
and solar.

In 2015, the Renewable Energy Division was established to manage and
promote the EDF group’s renewable energy activities, namely hydropower
and the activities of EDF Energies Nouvelles. This division also oversees all
renewable projects (wind, solar, marine energy, etc.) undertaken by the
Group, including those run by the foreign subsidiaries.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

The EDF group’s commitments in terms of developing renewable energy are
described in section 3.1 “Corporate responsibility commitments”.

1.4.1.4.1 Hydropower generation in France

The electricity generated by EDF from its fleet of hydropower plants in 2015
totalled 38.9TWh, 8.5% of its total electricity output.

1.4.1.4.1.1 EDF's hydropower generation fleet
EDF's hydropower fleet in mainland France comprises 433 plants:

= approximately 11% of these plants have a unit capacity above 100MW.
They account for around 60% of total generation;

= approximately 51% of these plants have a unit capacity under 12MW.
They account for around 6% of total generation.

The average age of the fleet is over 71 years?.

(1) These values correspond to the sum of the specific values, rounded to one decimal place.

(2) Including generation from the tidal power plant on the river Rance (518GWh in 2015).

Within mainland France, hydropower plants are mainly located in
mountainous areas in the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Massif Central and the
Jura, as well as on the Rhine. In all, they represent an installed capacity of
approximately 20GW (excluding French overseas departments and Corsica),
or 20% of EDF's fleet, for an annual generation capability of around 40TWh.

The various hydropower facilities are designed to optimise the use of water
resources in the valleys where they are situated. Given the size and variety of
its fleet, EDF has facilities able to respond to all types of desired uses, from
base to peak generation, and which also offer levers for optimisation due to
their flexibility: run-of-river plants, like the ones on the Rhine, which have no
storage capacity and generate electricity depending on the available water

flow; plants with pondage, thus accessing average-sized reservoirs (smaller
than lakes) for occasional use during the week or during the day, to cover
peaks in demand; lake plants (seasonal reservoirs) located in mountainous
areas (Alps, Massif Central and Pyrenees); pumped-storage plants (commonly
known in France as STEPs, from their French acronym), which pump water
from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir during periods of low demand
when electricity is also lower in cost, in order to build up reserves used
to generate energy at peak times (by releasing the stored water through
turbines from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir); and a tidal power
plant on the river Rance which, using the up and down movement of the
tides, provides a very regular supply of electricity.

upstream reservoirs is 1.1TWh on average.

1.4.1.4.1.2 Hydropower safety

Hydropower safety comprises all the measures taken when designing and
operating hydropower plants to reduce risks and hazards to people and
property associated with water and the presence or operation of facilities.
Hydropower safety is a constant concern of the highest priority for plant
operators (see section 2.2.6.2 “Management of hydropower safety risk”).
It involves three main activities:

m= the management of operational risks, including those associated with
flow or level fluctuations in downstream waterways;

= =the management of facilities during periods of exceptionally high water
levels, in order to ensure safety at the facilities and for the surrounding
communities;

™ measures to address the major risk associated with dam or reservoir
failures, through the regular monitoring and maintenance of facilities
under the supervision of public authorities, mainly the French regional
environment, land use and housing authorities (Directions Régionales
de |’Environnement, de I‘Aménagement et du Logement, or DREAL).
Among the largest dams, 68 are subject to a specific administrative
procedure (plan particulier d‘intervention, or PPI) implemented by the
relevant prefectoral authority.

EDF performs regular monitoring and maintenance of its dams, in particular
by means of continuous structural health assessments.

In addition, a comprehensive verification of each of the 150 largest dams is
carried out every ten years, as well as a drain down or a structure inspection
using underwater equipment. These operations are carried out under the
supervision of public authorities (the DREAL office at the regional level as
well as the Service technique de I’énergie électrique des grands barrages
et de I’hydraulique, and STEEGBH, the central French government agency
specifically responsible for large dams and hydropower facilities).

Furthermore, carrying out exhaustive studies that contribute to safety is a
regulatory requirement for dam owners and operators: danger assessments
for class A facilities (dams whose height is greater than or equal to 20 metres)
and class B facilities (dams whose height is greater than 10 metres and
whose volume exceeds a threshold set by regulations), and safety reviews
for class A structures. EDF adheres to the expected timetable: the 240 first
generation danger assessments were delivered to the Control Department
of the French government. The safety review timetable is also well under
way, with 120 reviews delivered in 2015 out of the 157 expected by 2017.
They consolidate a satisfactory overview of the structures and associated
countermeasures '.

In 2015, the hydropower safety of EDF's fleet remained good with no
hydropower safety incident (EISH) classified as “orange” (an incident that
placed people in danger, within the meaning of the Decree dated 21 May
2010). 23 EISH classified as “yellow” (incidents reflecting non-compliance
without putting anyone in danger) were recorded this year. The key indicators
are still at good levels:

® increased detection of significant (non-serious) events (ESSH level 0) by
the local teams, with 3,409 events detected;

= lownumber of incidents with external effects (ESSH level > 1). 32 incidents
took place;

® areduction in the number of sites with high sensitivity to risks related to
variations in water flow downstream of facilities, which fell from 114 in
2005 to 11 in 2015 (18 in 2014, 19 in 2013). Although it was marked
by low hydraulicity levels (the 4" lowest since 1948 according to EDF
data), 2015 saw a number of periods of high levels in the Northern
Alps and on the Rhine (with occasional historically high levels in certain
catchment areas such as the Arve). Nevertheless, the management of
hydro-electric structures was properly controlled during these events.

Control of risks associated with the facilities ageing is a major concern
in hydropower safety and has been strengthened, and the long-term
maintenance policy was updated in 2012. With more than €800 million
spent on hydropower safety between 2007 and 2014, EDF has undertaken
the largest hydropower facility renovation programmes of recent decades. In
2015, safety work continued and a significant portion of the maintenance
budget was dedicated thereto.

In 2006, EDF launched the “SuPerHydro” hydropower facility renovation
programme (Safety and Performance) with a total budget of €1,122 million
(current euro value). In 2015, this programme was superseded by the safety
and performance components of the engineering programmes for the
hydropower fleet in operation while carefully monitoring safety-related
activities. The goal is the technical updating and improved maintenance
of the facilities, in order to maintain a high level of hydropower safety and
preserve the technical performance of the fleet over the long-term. At
the end of 2015, 579 specific systems and measures were carried out and
monitored in five priority facility groups: galleries, pipes, dams, penstocks
and floodgates '.

These two programmes were reinforced by the “RenouvEau” project whose
goal is to improve safety as well as performance and competitiveness of
the hydropower fleet. The tools, methods and works defined as part of the
“RenouvEau” project are currently being rolled out to all major facilities in the
hydropower fleet (see section 1.4.1.4.1.3 “Performance of the hydropower
generation fleet”).

1.4.1.4.1.3 Performance of the hydropower generation fleet

A highly automated fleet

In order to take advantage of the flexibility of its hydropower generation
facilities, for some years now EDF has been initiating ambitious programmes
involving automation, remote control of hydropower plants and centralised
management of the valleys. Currently, the largest plants in EDF's hydropower
fleet, representing just over 15GW, i.e., around 75% of its installed
hydropower capacity, are remote-controlled from four control centres able
to make adjustments to the plants’ operating programmes at any time in
order to respond to the needs of the electrical system and to economic
opportunities arising on the electricity market.

Technical performance of the fleet and 2015 hydropower
conditions

Hydropower generation may witness substantial variations from one year to
‘the next, depending on climatic fluctuations in water resources. Hydrological
conditions in 2015 were unfavourable.

Hydropower electricity generation before the deduction of the power needed
to operate pumped-storage plants was 38.91TWh in mainland France and
32.1TWh net of consumption by pumped storage.

The overall availability of the hydropower fleet, i.e. the percentage of time
over the year during which the power plants are available at full capacity,
was 80.38% in 2015, up compared to 2014. In 2015, 15.88% of the
unavailability of EDF's hydropower fleet was due to asset maintenance
work (planned unavailability) mainly as part of the “SuPerHydro” renovation
programme (see above), while 3.7% of unavailability was due to work delays
and breakdowns (unplanned unavailability). The demand response rate, i.e.
the rate of success in responding to start-up orders received by the power
plants, has been over 99% for several years.

In 2011, EDF also began an ambitious modernisation project to improve
the industrial performance of its hydropower fleet, for an overall amount
Of €,49840 million by 2021. This project, known as “RenouvEau”, aims
to modernise the maintenance and operation of the hydropower fleet,
specifically via the renovation of electrical facilities, control monitoring and
computerised management, maintenance and operating tools, in order to
improve the operating performance of the hydropower fleet. The full roll-
out of the project will run from 2014 to 2020.

1.4.1.4.1.4 Hydropower generation issues

The hydropower segment is currently working to address the following
issues: implementation of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Law,
managing access to water, and development.

Concessions renewal

Hydropower generation facilities are operated through concessions granted
by decree for facilities exceeding 100MW, by prefectoral order for facilities
whose capacity is between 4.5MW and 100MW, and under prefectoral
authorisation for facilities under 4.5MW (see section 1.5.6.2.4 “Regulations
applicable to hydropower facilities”).

EDF currently holds the majority of the hydropower concessions in France.

Concessions have an initial term of 75 years, pursuant to the French Law of
16 October 1919 relating to hydropower use, and are in general renewed
for terms of 30 to 50 years.

Under the current regulation, the former concession holder does not
receive any compensation if an expiring concession is not renewed. Article
L. 521-15 of the French Energy Code enacted by the amended Finance
Act for 2006 provides for the reimbursement of unamortised expenses
related to modernisation works or to works that enable the expansion of
generation capability, provided that these works were carried out during
the second half of the concession. However, if a concession is terminated by
anticipation by the French government, the operator receives compensation.
This compensation from the government is intended to offset the shortfall
for the outgoing operator due to the early termination of the operation of
the concession, as provided by the concession specifications.

In this context, for some years EDF has prepared itself to submit its best offer
for each concession, combining improved energy efficiency, attention to
aquatic environments, compensation of the government and municipalities
through fees and regional development, while ensuring the safety and
security of operations.

The European Commission (EC) initiated proceedings against the French State
regarding hydropower concessions in France, based on Article 106 § 1 of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) read in conjunction
with Article 102 of the same treaty. In this respect, on 22 October 2015 the
EC sent the French State a letter of formal notice, in which it stated that the

1. Minimum flow maintained downstream of dams to protect aquatic life.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

awarding to and reservation for EDF of most of the hydropower concessions
in France represented a breach of the aforementioned provisions in that
such measures would strengthen EDF's dominant position in the French retail
electricity market. The State responded to this formal notice, beginning a
series of submissions and responses by the French State and the EC, which
in no way prejudices the latter's final decision. As the chief interested party,
EDF received a copy of the formal notice and sent its observations to the
EC on 4 January 2016.

Managing access to water

Water reservoirs held by EDF's 239 large dams in France enable the storage
of 7.5 billion cubic metres of water, corresponding to 75% of national
surface storage reserves.

The hydropower facilities have positive effects on both economic development
and the environment, and EDF applies a proactive management policy in
relation to water resources, in liaison with various water stakeholders.
Agreements are entered into with local elected officials, farmers, fishermen,
managers of tourist sites and manufacturers (see section 3.2.2.6 “Protection
of biodiversity”).

The Law of 30 December 2006 on water and aquatic environments contains
provisions relating to the management of water resources (in particular,
the benefits of reserved flows ' and the flexibility of hydropower plant
operations). EDF estimates that these provisions have limited medium-term
consequences for its hydropower activities (see section 1.5 “Legislative and
regulatory environment”).

Development

Currently, 95% of France’s hydropower potential is being used. EDF is
nevertheless continuing the development of its hydropower activities,
through the study and realisation of new projects.

A micro-power plant project is in progress close to the Kembs dam on the
Rhine, for a capacity of SMW and a generation capability of 28GWh, with
commissioning planned for 2016.

The Rondeau hydropower plant was inaugurated on 1 October 2015 in Isere
in the Echirolles municipality near Grenoble. It is the most powerful of EDF's
hydropower micro-plants. The plant uses water from a small 4.30 metre
high waterfall near the end of the Drac tail race, an artificial canal bringing
water from up the river. To make use of this small waterfall, it was necessary
to have recourse to new “made in France” technology, the Very Low Head
(VLH) turbine, designed and assembled by the Aveyron-based French SME,
MJ2 Technologies. The installed capacity is 2.2MW with a generation
capacity of 13.7GWh.

Generation from reserved flows will continue to be developed. The
purpose is to equip a certain number of dams in order to process the
reserved flow through the turbines and recover a portion of the associated
energy. In 2015, five reserved-flow turbine sets were installed. Units were
commissioned during the year at the Beaumont-Moneteux dam on the river
Isére, the Notre-Dame-de-Commiers dam on the Drac river, the La Chatre
dam on the Creuse river and the Prétiére dam on the Doubs river. These
five sets generated total actual capacity of 3,323kW in 2015. Projects are
under consideration or in progress for a total capacity of some 10MW and
generation capability of about 7OGWh, with expected commissioning dates
ranging from 2016 to 2020.

In addition, EDF's objective is to use all available opportunities for expansion,
and in particular to:

= optimise the potential of energy transfer by pumped-storage hydropower
plants in France (STEPs);

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

= look into the possibilities for “surplus generation” (for instance, by
increasing the capacity of existing hydropower plants) detailed in Article
L. 511-6 of the French Energy Code enacted by the Law of 13 July 2005
setting out the guidelines for the energy policy (provision repealed from
1 April 2016 by Order no. 2016-65 of 29 January 2016 on concession
contracts), to contribute to the development of means to respond to
peak demand. Construction is already ongoing at the La Coche and La
Bathie plants. The Decree of 17 June 2013 authorised EDF to build a new
240MW turbine generator set at La Coche STEP in Savoy. This Pelton set,
construction of which began in 2016, will increase the capacity of the
existing facility by 20% and will generate approximately an additional
100GWh every year. For the La Bathie plant, excess output has been
achieved by replacing the six generation sets and should total around
SOMW. At end-2015, three sets were put in place;

™ take the opportunity during facility upgrades to increase their capacities;

adapt existing facilities (modernisation, optimising generation, etc.) as
part of concession renewals. Accordingly, in the context of renewing
the Middle Romanche concession and in line with decrees published on
31 December 2010, EDF has begun work to replace six small existing
plants with the construction of a new subterranean plant (Romanche-
Gavet plant) with a capacity of 93MW and generation capability of
560GWh, or 155GWh more than existing plants;

= develop “small-scale” hydropower plants (with capacity under 12MW).
One of the aims is to develop small-scale hydropower by:

= optimising and increasing the generation capability of the existing
fleet (renovation of 16 plants in the Mayenne department, renovation
programme for plants in the Var, Lot and Dordogne departments),

= acquiring existing small-scale hydropower facilities in France,
= building new small-scale hydropower facilities,
= forging partnerships for project development.

EDF has also strengthened the range of initiatives pursued by its entities in
support of regional and local development. This approach is reflected in the
establishment of the “One River, One Territory” development programme,
which had opened seven agencies around France by the end of 2015.

1.4.1.4.2 New renewable energies

1.4.1.4.2.1 Wind power

Awind turbine uses the action of the wind to drive rotor blades connected
to an electrical generator. There are various categories:

= onshore wind power: this is a mature sector which is now close to
competing with, if not matching, traditional sectors in certain areas.
It benefits from economic incentives in various countries, although
an increasing number of projects are developed without a financial
support mechanism (see section 1.5.3 “Electricity market legislation”).
On average, the rated capacity of onshore wind turbines installed
worldwide is around 2MW, a figure which is increasing steadily. The
subsidiary responsible for developing wind power within the Group is
EDF Energies Nouvelles. The subsidiaries EDF Luminus and Edison also
have wind farms in service. The EDF group generated 10.7TWh of wind-
based electricity in 2015;

= offshore wind turbines: a less mature, high-growth sector, it currently
requires a higher initial investment and is more expensive to connect to
the grid than onshore wind power. Offshore operation and maintenance
are also more difficult. The advantages of this sector are the higher
rated capacity of each wind turbine (typically over 3MW) and increased
productivity due to more reliable winds. The sector is on a learning
curve that will enable it to reduce the cost differential with onshore
wind generation. The EDF group has decided to ramp up its investment
in offshore wind generation, which offers interesting development
prospects, at least in two of the Group’s key countries: France and the
United Kingdom.

1.4.1.4.2.2 Solar photovoltaic power

The operating principle of solar photovoltaic power is to convert sunlight
directly into electricity. Photovoltaic solar power is used in two ways: it can
either be connected to the grid, or it can generate electricity at isolated
sites. Grid-connected photovoltaic systems have witnessed steady growth
around the world in two markets: ground-based solar farms and residential
rooftop installations.

Since 2014, the photovoltaic market in France has surged once more, with
950MW connected to the grid in 2014 and 880MW in 2015 (compared
with 650MW in 2013)".

The cost of generating solar power has fallen considerably in recent years.
However, innovation offers considerable room for improvement. EDF R&D
also conducts research on photovoltaic technology at its Chatou site, under
the aegis of the French Institute for Photovoltaic Power Research and
Development (IRDEP), established in partnership with CNRS (National Centre
for Scientific Research) and ENSCP (Paris National School of Chemistry).

1.4.1.4.2.3 Biomass and biogas

Technologies based on biomass mainly consists of burning certain types of
waste, particularly from the timber and farming industries, or exploiting
woodfuel forests, to produce heat or electricity.

Biofuels can come from a wide range of sources. There are three different
energy streams: combustion plants for plant matter (wood, agricultural
waste) or animal matter; biogas production plants (gas produced from
the fermentation of organic animal or plant matter); household waste
incineration plants.

Lastly, through its holdings, the Group owns shares in France (notably
through its subsidiary Dalkia, see section 1.4.6.1.1 “Dalkia”), and abroad
in several dozen heating networks and small-scale, mainly wood-fired
generating plants. It also has a majority interest in Tiru, which is active in
waste recovery (see section 1.4.6.1.3 “Tiru”).

1.4.1.4.2.4 Geothermal energy

The temperature of the rocks in the earth's crust increases with depth (3°C
on average every 100 metres). In some regions, geothermal energy reaches
the surface in the form of hot springs, water or steam. The hot water is
used directly in the form of heat: central heating in homes or heating of
greenhouses.

Steam extracted from the ground is also used to generate electricity: as
in a classic thermal power station, it drives a turbine. It is also possible to
use hot and dry rocks as a source of electricity production from steam. To

develop this type of energy, EDF has joined forces with several partners
(including Electricité de Strasbourg and German energy companies) as part of
a European consortium that develops and operates a prototype geothermal
power plant in the hot, naturally fractured crystalline rock around Soultz in
Alsace (see section 1.4.6.4 “Electricité de Strasbourg”).

France also has high-temperature resources located in its overseas territories.
The EDF group is present in this activity mainly through its minority stake in
the company Géothermie Bouillante in Guadeloupe.

1.4.1.4.2.5 Other technologies

Renewable energies cover a wide range of sectors and technologies. To
prepare for the future, EDF Energies Nouvelles is responsible within the
EDF group for identifying promising sectors and, with the support of the
Group’s R&D teams or industrial partners, contributes to the emergence of
new technologies. Along with solar power (see above), marine energy is
another area the Group is exploring in depth.

Two marine energy projects are currently in development:

® tidal turbines, which are underwater turbines harnessing the energy of
tidal currents. EDF has built a prototype tidal current turbine farm on the
Paimpol-Bréhat site in the Cétes-d'Armor department. This prototype
should shortly move into a second test phase with the first electricity
generation. The prototype was immersed on 20 January 2016 and should
shortly be connected to the grid. EDF Energies Nouvelles, in partnership
with DCNS, Europe's leading manufacturer of naval vessels, is working
on the “Normandie Hydro” project, a larger-capacity tidal current turbine
farm at Raz Blanchard, at the tip of the Cotentin peninsula in Normandy;

= floating offshore wind turbines: EDF Energies Nouvelles plans to bid in
partnership to the call for proposals launched by the French government.
in August 2015 for pilot farms. The call for tenders is for farms with
between three and six turbines, each with a rated capacity of at least
5MW, which should be located in one of the following four areas: in
the waters off ile de Groix (Brittany), the Faraman lighthouse (Provence
- Alpes - Céte d’Azur), the marshes in Leucate and in the Gruissan
municipality (Languedoc-Roussillon).

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES

1.4.1.4.3 EDF Energies Nouvelles

The EDF group’s involvement in renewable energies is undertaken mainly
by the EDF Energies Nouvelles (EDF EN) subsidiary, which is 99.99% owned
(0.01% being owned by the employees '). The companies in the EDF EN
group had a combined 3,029 employees at 31 December 2015.

The company, which is the Group’s centre of expertise and development,
particularly in the fields of wind and photovoltaic solar power, is one of
the major players in electricity generation from renewables particularly in
the major regions in which it is based: North America and western and
southern Europe.

EDF EN generates electricity from renewable energy sources and is involved in
every stage of the value chain. It operates upstream, in project development,
as well as in the construction of power plants and their operation and
maintenance. Each of these activities may be conducted on its own account
or on behalf of third parties. As part of its project development activities, the
Group is also involved in the Development and Sale of Structured Assets (an
activity referred to as “DSSA"), which mainly consists of developing projects
to be sold, in whole or in part, sooner or later, to third parties interested in
such infrastructure assets.

With development focussing on wind and photovoltaic solar power (which
represent around 97% of its installed capacity), EDF EN is also present in other
renewable energy segments, primarily marine energy. Lastly, EDF EN is also
present in the decentralised renewable energy sector (rooftop solar power).

Historically, EDF EN has primarily developed in two geographical regions:
western and southern Europe (mainly France, UK, Italy and Portugal) and
North America (USA, Canada and Mexico). Since 2012, the Group has
become established in new countries with significant potential for renewables
development, such as South Africa, Poland, Morocco in wind power, and
Israel and India in photovoltaic solar power. This expansion continued in
2015 with new facilities in Chile and Brazil. At end-2015, EDF EN teamed
up with a wind developer in India (SITAC Group) to develop this technology.

At 31 December 2015, EDF EN had a gross installed capacity of 9,063.3MW, a
net installed capacity of 6,131.5MW anda gross capacity under construction
of 1,408.8MW.

. Following the alternative cash or exchange tender offer for EDF EN shares realised by EDF in 2011, EDF implemented a mechanism designed to ensure the liquidity of bonus

shares granted to EDF EN employees and executive officers prior to the tender offer. Pursuant to this mechanism, EDF will ultimately hold all the shares which are still held

as of today by EDF EN employees.

Wind power

Onshore wind power

EDF EN actively pursued growth in onshore wind energy in 2015, increasing
its wind generation capacity by 1,358.6MW gross, bringing its total operating
capacity of onshore wind energy to 7,525.1MW gross at end-2015.

Onshore wind farms with a gross capacity of 1,614.9MW were commissioned
in 2015, onshore wind farms under construction representing a gross capacity
of 1,060.2MW at 31 December 2015.

As part of its DSSA operations, 543.3MW of onshore wind power was sold
in North America (Canada and United States).

France

In 2015, EDF EN went over one Gigawatt of wind power in service (gross
capacity of 1,040.4MW at 31 December 2015). It was a year that saw the
acquisition of new farms located in eastern France totalling 44MW, and
the commissioning of the first phase of the Pézilla wind farm (44MW).
At 31 December 2015, 146.4MW of onshore wind power was under
construction in France.

United Kingdom

EDF Energy Renewables (50/50 joint-venture with EDF Energy) operated
a total gross capacity of 589.7MW of wind power at end-2015 (a net
capacity of 208.1MW).

At end-2015, the Burnhead Moss (26MW), Park Spring (8.6MW) and
Rhodders (12.3MW) projects had been commissioned with the acquisition
in November of the Dorenell wind farm project located in the Scottish
Highlands. It has been granted permission by the Scottish government for a
potential capacity of 177MW. At present, 67.2MW of onshore wind power
is under construction in the United Kingdom.

Turkey

Located in western Turkey, the Soma wind farm (240MW), which previously
had two phases of 79.2MW and 60.9MW, now has a third phase consisting
of 50 Enercon turbines with a unit capacity of 2MW each (i.e. 1OOMW) which
was commissioned in July 2015. To date, EDF EN has built eight wind farms
in the country, representing a total gross installed capacity of 612.8MW.

South Africa

The first three wind farms won in the second call for tenders — Chaba (21 MW),
Grassridge (59.8MW) and Waaineck (23.3MW) — were commissioned in
2015. Moreover, EDF EN was selected for an additional 33MW of wind
power, during the fourth round (part b) of the call for tenders by the Ministry
of Energy in June 2015. It also participated in the Round 4c call for tenders,
the results of which are expected to be announced in mid-2016.

United States

The Group operates in the United States through EDF Renewable Energy
(EDF RE), an independent renewable energy producer that is wholly owned
by EDF EN.

At end-2015, EDF RE had a gross installed capacity of 2,818.2MW (or
2,233.4 net) of onshore wind power in the United States.

At 31 December 2015, EDF Renewable Energy went over 1GW of installed
capacity in Texas and had commissioned net wind power capacity of 987 MW
with in particular the Spinning Spur 3 (194MW) and Longhorn (200MW)
wind farms in Texas, the Pilot Hill (175MW) wind farm in Illinois, the Slate
Creek (150MW) wind farm in Kansas and the Roosevelt (250MW) wind
farm in New Mexico.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Innovative partnerships have been established. A purchase price agreement
was signed with Google for the construction of the Great Western wind
farm (with a capacity of 225MW) and a similar agreement was put in place
with Procter & Gamble to supply wind power electricity for the group's
laundry and household product manufacturing facilities in North America.

EDF RE also commissioned a battery project (McHenry) designed to help
stabilise the grid (2OMW). 737.7MW in onshore wind power is currently
under construction with in particular the Kelly Creek, Salt Fork and indeed
the Great Western wind farms.

In 2015, 394.5MW was sold, primarily involving 50% of the Hereford and
Longhorn North wind farms and 100% of Chanarambie.

Canada

At end-2015, the Group’s total gross installed wind power capacity in
Canada was 589.7MW (or 565.7MW net).

In 2008, EDF EN won a call for tenders issued by Hydro-Québec to build
five wind farms in Quebec with a total capacity of 954MW. All of the wind
farms have now been built with the commissioning in 2015 of the Mont
Rothery (74MW) wind farm as well as phase II of the wind farm at Riviere
du Moulin (2OOMW).

Anew project (Nicolas Riou, 225MW) was won following a call for tenders.
Construction should begin in 2016.

Thanks to the DSSA programme in Canada, which in 2015 involved 148.8MW
(Riviere du Moulin), investment partnerships enabled portfolio disposals
totalling more than 698.8MW.

Offshore wind power

Offshore wind power will be a growth driver over the next few years,
particularly in France and the United Kingdom.

In France, for the three projects awarded in 2012 with a total capacity of
1,428MW, permits were applied for in October 2014, in accordance with
the tender specifications. All three projects received favourable opinions
from the public inquiries.

In the United Kingdom, through the subsidiary EDF Energy Renewables
(a 50/50 joint-venture with EDF Energy), the Navitus Bay offshore project
(630MW) continued its preliminary development phase in 2015. Following
the refusal of the building permit, the project was suspended. The
development rights were also obtained for the Blyth offshore prototype
farm (41.5MW) in Northumberland. Comprising 5 turbines, it should allow
new offshore technology to be tested in real conditions.

Photovoltaic solar power

EDF EN pursued growth in solar photovoltaics, its second area of growth.
At end-2015, installed solar capacity totalled 917.6MWp gross (572.4MWp.
net), an increase of 190.5MWp gross from end-2014. EDF EN also has a
portfolio of solar projects under construction comprising 329.6MWp gross.

North America

EDF RE commissioned and sold in 2015 the Cottonwood Solar (32.6MWp)
and Catalina 2 Solar (25MWp) photovoltaic solar power projects in
California. In North America, the Group has total photovoltaic solar power
of 183.7MWp gross.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

India

As part of the partnership with Acme Solar, in which EDF EN has a 25%
interest, the NMS and Odisha solar farms were commissioned (150.5MWp
gross). They are located in the Indian states of Rajasthan and Odisha, and
were won in calls for tenders run by the Indian government for NSM and
the State of Odisha for the project of that name.

In addition, 132MWp were under construction at 31 December 2015.

Israel

The Group operates photovoltaic projects with 108.5MWp gross in Israel
and should shortly complete the construction of an additional SOMWp.

Chile

EDF EN established a new subsidiary in Chile in 2015 and is currently building
a 146MWp photovoltaic solar farm in the Atacama desert.

Operating & Maintenance

As an integrated operator, EDF EN operates and maintains most of its own
wind and solar facilities. This activity has grown significantly and is also
carried out on behalf of third parties. Worldwide, EDF EN operated more
than 13.9GW at end December 2015 in ten countries. In addition, EDF EN
is the leading operation-maintenance company in the United States through
its subsidiary EDF Renewable Energy Services, managing close to 11GW in
North America. Its position in Europe has been enhanced, exceeding 3GW
at end-2015.

The growth in this activity is driven by the commissioning of new wind farms
and by taking over wind farms operated by turbine manufacturers whose
contracts, under the warranty, ended.

In 2015, a new subsidiary was established in the UK in partnership with
EDF Energy.

Decentralised Energy

EDF Energies Nouvelles Réparties (EDF ENR) is wholly owned by EDF EN.
EDF ENR is now an integrated player in decentralised photovoltaic solar power
generation, involved in the design, build, operation and maintenance of
rooftop installations. EDF ENR Solaire, a wholly owned subsidiary, markets
and installs photovoltaic solar power solutions in France, with more than
14,000 residential customers and over 900 projects delivered to business
customers and local authorities.

EDF ENR also generates around 30MW of clean energy from more than 200
rooftop photovoltaic plants that it owns in mainland France.

In addition, EDF ENR is present in the upstream segment. The company owns
100% of EDF ENR PWT (Photowatt brand), which designs and manufactures
photovoltaic panels. EDF ENR PWT operates in a difficult market characterised
by strong competition and low module prices. Faced with this situation,
a proactive action plan was implemented to improve the product offering
of EDF ENR PWT, with a view to continually improving the performance of
modules that, thanks to the fact that they are 100% French-made, have
a low carbon footprint.

Lastly, EDF ENR is the controlling shareholder of EDF Store & Forecast (51%
owned by EDF ENR and 49% by EDEV). EDF Store & Forecast, founded in
March 2014, markets software solutions to forecast, plan and optimise
automatic control of renewable energy generation and storage.

1.4.2 SALES AND SUPPLY ACTIVITIES

1.4.2.1. Presentation of the market in France

1.4.2.1.1 Demand

Domestic electricity consumption in France (including Corsica) for the 2015
fiscal year stood at 475.4TWh', up 2.2% in comparison with 2014. After
adjustments for the weather factor, it was up a modest 0.5%.

Domestic gas consumption amounted to 426.9TWh? in 2015, or a drop
of 7.7% in comparison with 2014. After adjustment for the impact of
climate, it was up 3.4%.

1.4.2.1.2 Competition

Since 1 July 2007, the French market has been fully open for electricity and
gas sales: all customers are free to choose their energy providers. They may
opt at any time, and without advance notice, for an offer at market price
from the supplier of their choice.

Among the electricity suppliers on the French market, the main competitors
of EDF are Engie, E.ON (Uniper, SNET), Enel and Direct Energie. The main
competitor, Engie, has more than 11 million gas and electricity customers in
mainland France and is also the leading supplier of gas?. In the gas market
and in the corporate and local authority customer segment, the other major
gas suppliers are Tegaz, Eni, Gaz Natural, Gazprom, E. ON (Uniper, SNET) and
Antargaz. In the gas residential customer segment, the principle suppliers
are ENGIE, Direct Energie and Eni.

As of 31 December 2015, according to the CRE, the electricity market shares
in terms of sites of alternative suppliers, i.e. excluding historical suppliers,
were 11.6% in the residential market, and 11.7% in the non-residential
market, and a gas market share, in number of sites, respectively of 19.7%
and 35.4%.

The 2010 NOME Law established certain rules for the supply of electricity
and gas, the main provisions of which, codified today in the Energy Code,
are the following:

= regulated electricity and gas tariffs are partially covered by provisions
described for electricity in section 1.4.2.1.3 “Regulated electricity sales
tariff contracts” below;

™ regulated access to historic nuclear power (ARENH) was put into place to
the benefit of EDF's competing electricity suppliers (see section 1.4.3.3
“Regulated access to historic nuclear power (Accés Régulé a I’Energie
Nucléaire Historique, or ARENH)").

In order to supply their customers, EDF's competing electricity suppliers
had access in 2015:

m to their own generation capacities;
m@ to 16.1TWh under the ARENH mechanism;

m= to 0.3TWh‘ made available by the EDF group through the intermediary
of “capacity auctions”;

= to imports;

m to the wholesale electricity market.

1.4.2.1.3 Regulated elect sales tariff contracts

Access to regulated elect: tariffs

Since the NOME Law entered into force in 2011, the situation for electricity,
by category of customer, is as follows:

= domestic and non-domestic final consumers who have subscribed power
for their site(s) not exceeding 36kVA: these customers benefit, upon their
request, from regulated sales tariffs. They can switch back and forth
between regulated tariffs and market offers, without a legal time limit;

= domestic and non-domestic final consumers who have subscribed power
for their site(s) greater than or equal to 36kVA: since 1 January 2016,
these customers no longer benefit from the regulated sales tariffs for
consumption by these sites; any customer that hadn't switched to a
market offering by that date is supplied by EDF, for a period of six months,
in accordance with the conditions defined in chapter III of Article 25 of
the Law of 17 March 2014 on consumption;

= domestic and non-domestic final consumers for their site(s) located in
areas not connected to the continental metropolitan network: these
customers receive regulated sales tariffs upon request.

Moreover, as part of its public service missions, EDF has, since 1 January
2005, been offering the electricity basic necessity tariff (tarif de premiére
nécessité, or TPN), for which the eligibility criteria were altered in 2013 to
open it up to more consumers and enable all electricity suppliers to offer it.
The Energy Transition for Green Growth Law, provides certain provisions to
combat energy poverty, with the practical details regarding implementation
being left to decrees and orders:

= implementation of an energy cheque, on trial in certain regions from
2016, to replace the basic necessity tariff;

= enabling the remote display of electricity consumption.

At 1 August 2015, the increase, excluding taxes, of the regulated sales tariffs
was on average 2.5% for the residential Blue Tariffs, 0.9% for the Yellow
Tariffs, and 4% for the Green Tariffs, with the professional Blue Tariffs being
unchanged, pursuant to the Order of 30 July 2015. This change was not
identical within each tariff colour; it was modulated by option in order to
better cover the costs of each one of them. In its opinion issued on 28 July
2015, the Energy Regulation Commission (CRE) disagreed with the level of
the increase in the yellow and green tariffs, deemed insufficient to make up
the under-coverage of costs in previous years prior to the end of regulated
tariffs for sites that subscribed power greater than 36kVA. Moreover, another
Order of 30 July 2015, which came into force on 1 August, relating to the
tariffs for the sale of electricity to the LDCs, introduced an increase in those
tariffs of 3.64%, starting from 1 August 2015.

1.4.2.1.4 Market-rate elect

ity supply contracts

In France, customers are free to leave the regulated sales tariffs at any time
and without advance notice for an offer proposed by any other supplier.

With the exception of customers directly connected to the transmission
network, who must sign separate supply and delivery contracts, all other
customers may enter into a single contract with the supplier of their choice
for their electricity supply and delivery.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

1.4.2.2. The Customer Division

EDF's sales and supply activities in France are managed by the Customer
Division.

1.4.2.2.1 Presentation and supply strategy

In France, EDF markets energy and services to nearly 26.7 million customer
accounts (excluding overseas and Corsica), or almost 33 million sites. The
offers are developed and implemented in compliance with the market risk
policy of the Group.

On the electricity market, EDF's sales in 2015 were 355TWh, which
represents a market share of 77.4%. In 2014, sales were 353.8TWh and
market share 78.8%.

EDF provides gas supply to all types of customers. In 2015, EDF marketed
22.6TWh of gas, which represented a market share of 5%, to more than
1.2 million customers. At the end of 2015 year, EDF was supplying gas to
more than 1.1 million residential customers (in comparison with 1 million
at end-2014).

In addition to electricity supply and gas offers, the Group assists its customers
in all market segments, in their actions and their investments in energy
efficiency and decentralised production. The EDF group is presenting energy
efficient offers to its customers in order to make it possible for them to
better control their energy expenditures, and offers to put them in contact
with qualified partners.

This procedure meets the objectives of the Law for the Scheduling and
Orientation of Energy Policy of 13 July 2005, and to the Grenelle 2 Law
of 12 July 2010 (see section 1.5.6.1 “Basic regulations applicable to the
environment, health, hygiene and safety”), as well as to the governmental
objectives of thermal renovation of housing, what enables EDF to obtain
energy savings certificates (certificats d’économies d‘énergie, or CEEs) in
exchange for actions realised with all of its customers. Put into place in
2006, this mechanism changed on 1 January 2015, particularly in order
to contribute to the achievement of the objectives set by the directive of
25 October 2012 pertaining to energy efficiency: the national obligation
for the third period (2015-2017) is set at 700TWhc, doubled in relation to
the second period. In addition, the Energy Transition for Green Growth Law
places energy suppliers under an obligation to facilitate energy savings for
households in energy poverty. The regulations published on 30 December
2015 set a target of 150TWhc over 2016-2017.

Moreover, EDF is positioning itself as a major player in energy transition
by its visible and sustainable territorial action. Furthermore, EDF is also
supporting the roll-out of smart meters and is committed to promoting the
futur smart electrical systems.

1.4.2.2.2 Activity by customer category

1.4.2.2.2.1 Residential customers

At the end of December 2015, EDF had 27.1 million residential electricity
sites and 1.1 million gas customers in France. For fiscal year 2015, the volume
of its sales rose to 133.8TWh of electricity and 10.6TWh of natural gas.

EDF is striving to sustainably develop the confidence of its customers, by
accompanying them in order to make energy savings. When contacting
EDF, 9 out of 10 customers state they are satisfied with the response,
regardless of the channel or why they contacted the company. The customer
experience offered, underpinned by ongoing innovation, is a mix of digital
and human. There are now over 10 million customer spaces with close to
5,000 advisers to serve them.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Energy supply

EDF supplies electricity at the regulated sales tariff and as part of market
offerings.

EDF also supplies 1.1 million customers with natural gas as part of market
offerings.

EDF innovates for its residential customers and at the end of 2015 year,
EDF launched the renewable offering, under which EDF guarantees that
enough electricity from renewable sources will be added to the grid to cover
the consumption of customers taking up this offer. In addition, for every
megawatt-hour consumed, EDF will contribute two euros to the “Previnergy”
research programme, focussed on forecasting renewable energy generation.

Functionality and services

To facilitate the management of energy contracts, EDF offers digital tools
and services: “EDF & Moi" application, electronic invoice, “Relevé confiance”
service, etc. In March 2015, EDF launched a new digital solution “e.quilibre”,
designed to provide customers with greater transparency regarding their
energy consumption in killowatt-hour and in euros (electricity and gas) and
allowing them to compare it with similar homes.

EDF also offers energy savings advice on the website travaux. edf.fr, and has
a network of almost 4,000 EDF home solutions partners to help residential
customers to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Customers can
also access financing solutions from EDF's financial partner (Domofinance)
to see through these plans.

Earning of energy savings certificates (CEE)

With respect to residential customers, CEEs are earned from the thermal
renovation of the home, primarily based on a network of EDF home
solutions partners.

For information relating to the regulatory framework concerning the CEEs,
see section 1.5.6.1 “Basic regulations applicable to the environment, health,
hygiene and safety”.

Solidarity policy

Solidarity is a core value of EDF, which has been pursuing a policy dedicated
to economically disadvantaged customers for close to 30 years (see
section 3.2.3.6.1 “Contributing to the fight against energy poverty and
energy access”).

1.4.2.2.2.2 Corporate and business customers

EDF, operating under the EDF Entreprises brand, has 1.6 million corporate
and business customers. For the 2015 fiscal year, electricity sales were
175.8TWh at the regulated sales tariff and at market prices, and sales of
natural gas were 10.6TWh.

EDF Entreprises supports businesses and professionals so as to make them
more competitive, in particular by helping them in reducing their energy bill.
This action is in keeping with the environmental dimension of the sustainable
development strategy of the EDF group, and also has as an objective to
contribute to the performance of the French electricity system, in avoiding
investments in order to cover spikes in electricity.

The range of offers

EDF Entreprises provides businesses and professionals with competitive
tailor-made electricity and gas supply offers. Offers are varied depending
on customer expectations and consumption patterns.

The electricity offers provided by EDF Entreprises enable small businesses,
very small businesses and professionals to optimise their energy supply
through simple contractual arrangements. They allow customers that
consume more to choose the length of their commitment at the offered
prices, depending on their needs in terms of budget visibility. Lastly, EDF
Entreprises is able to tailor solutions for the heaviest users depending on
the structure of their consumption.

42 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

EDF Entreprises, through the structure of its offers, encourages its customers.
to optimise consumption having regard to generation costs, by offering
different prices at peak and off-peak hours, and even summer and winter
prices for heavier users. For large customers with greater control over their
consumption, EDF Entreprises offers to reward their ability to shed load on
peak winter days, even including in certain instances remote management
solutions.

EDF Entreprises allows all customers to choose electricity from renewable
sources to cover their consumption, with a view to contributing to the
energy transition. For small and medium sized enterprises and professionals,
it involves a specific offer, the renewable energy contract, which guarantees
that 100% of their consumption will come from electricity generated from
renewable energy sources in France and facilitates their communication
with their own customers regarding their commitment. In addition, for
every megawatt-hour billed EDF will contribute one euro to fund renewable
energy research projects or to develop new renewable energy electricity
generation units. For larger customers, it involves an option that allows
them to decide themselves what proportion of their consumption will come
from guaranteed sources, between 20% and 100%.

EDF Entreprises also enhanced its range of services intended for all its
electricity and gas customers, whether small companies or large industrial
customers: online consumption monitoring, electronic invoice, assistance
and troubleshooting, advice (optimisation of subscribed power, efficiency
and reduction of energy expenses, etc.), in particular for customers who
want to use an energy management system.

In order to always be as close as possible to the various expectations of its
customers, EDF has put into place offers dedicated to large customers, not
only with tailor-made electricity and gas supply offers and offers that reward
customers that can shed load, but also support controlling their energy
consumption and their CO, emissions as well as CO, trading for businesses
subject to the national quota allocation plan (see section 1.5.6.1 “Basic
regulations applicable to the environment, health, hygiene and safety”).

Customer satisfaction

EDF Entreprises includes in its goals the satisfaction of its customers, to
whon it listens and surveys on a regular basis both in terms of how offers
match needs, the monitoring of requests, and the information and advice
offered. In 2015, overall satisfaction rose 2 to 9 points depending on the
customer segment compared with 2014 to 80% of customers very satisfied
and rather satisfied.

1.4.2.2.2.3 Local authorities, low-income housing agencies,
Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) and public
service providers

Against the background of regional reform and the energy transition, EDF

offers customised solutions for local authorities and public institutions with

decentralised decision-making powers (hospitals, universities and major

graduate schools, chambers of commerce and industry, CROUS student

service centres, ports and airports).

EDF is active for these customers in five areas:
™ asa competitive market operator:

= the supply of electricity and gas at market price, responding to their
energy problems (proposal of offers and solutions adapted to the
needs described in calls for tender),

= the development of offers and services with the sustainable city in
mind: local climate plans, eco-districts, local generation, street lighting,
electric mobility, energy efficiency of buildings, etc.,

= the fight against energy poverty;
= with respect to its public service missions:

= the signing of concession contracts for the “supply” portion in relation
with ERDF for the “delivery” portion,

= the supply of electricity at the regulated sales tariff.


--- Page 32 ---

EDF manages over 56,000 customers in this market this way. These customers
all together represent approximately 1.2 million electricity sites, more than
281,700 of which are for social-housing lessors, for an annual consumption
of 29.3TWh and close to 8,000 natural gas sites for an annual consumption
of 1.4TWh. In addition to that are the 16.1TWh of electricity sold to the
Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) in 2015.

In 2015, satisfaction with EDF Collectivités ranged from 81% to 88%
depending on the segment. The quality of the relations with a dedicated
contact person, guidance, responses to claims, and actions in matters
of poverty are well received. 92% of customers have confidence in EDF
Collectivités.

Controlling energy

Agreements are signed with local authorities, pertaining to control of
their energy consumption. In addition, certain communities are in effect
self-endowed with competence in the area of energy, and arrange specific
actions in their region in matters concerning control of energy demand and
renewable energies. A “Load Amount” device for social-housing lessors aims
to improve the energy efficiency of social housing, and makes it possible for
EDF to issue energy savings certificates. In 2015, over 173,000 social housing
units were helped, more than 162,700 of which were for renovation work.

1.4.2.2.3 For sustainable

s and regions

The energy development of cities and regions is today naturally associated
with sustainable development objectives: environmental impact, local
economic activity and poverty constitute major preoccupations of local
governments (see section 3.2.2.3.3 “Helping customers consume less,
more efficiently”).

1.4.2.2.4 Public electricity distribution concessions

Public electricity distribution concessions cover two distinct missions:

m the development and the operation of public distribution networks
under ERDF's responsibility (see section 1.4.4.2 “Distribution — Electricité
Réseau Distribution France (ERDF)");

m the supply of electricity to customers benefiting from regulated sales
tariffs connected to the public distribution networks throughout the
territory of the concession, under the responsibility of EDF for mainland
France, excluding the LDCs. This mission is carried out in compliance
with the commitments of the concession specifications and general
terms and conditions of sale (subscription terms, payment and delivery
terms, contractualisation, etc.).

Each concession contract in mainland France is co-signed by EDF, ERDF
and the licensing authority, and concerns a municipality or a grouping of
municipalities. The public distribution of electricity is taking place in the
framework of 580 concession contracts, 49 of which are at departmental
level.

In 2014 and 2015, around twenty concession contracts were negotiated,
in particular with the Seine-et-Marne and Vaucluse energy consortia, the
Douaisis municipal association and the cities of Melun and Tours. Some
twenty concession contracts will expire in 2016 and in 2017. An organisation
and tools have been put into place, particularly in order to renew the
concession contracts, mobilise both national and regional competences,
develop the expertise of EDF's contacts in the contracting authorities,
draw up each year the concession activity reports (CRAC) and respond to
inspection requests from the granting authorities.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

The upcoming period will be particularly marked by the implementation of
the regulations on the content of concession activity reports set out in the
Energy Transition for Green Growth Law (TEPCV) of 17 August 2015, and
by work to modernise the model concession contract done in conjunction
with national bodies representing the granting authorities.

The Energy Transition for Green Growth Law, together with the MAPTAM!
and NOTRe? Laws, reaffirmed that metropolitan areas and urban communities
can act as granting authorities for the distribution and supply of electricity
at regulated sales tariffs. For the operator, this means broader dialogue on
the concession contract, changes to said contract, its management with the
urban communities, which now have an interest in such matters.

The Energy Transition for Green Growth Law in particular introduces
provisions that rebalance the governance between rural and urban
communities within departmental electricity consortia. EDF is preparing if
needs be to renegotiate concession contracts at metropolitan area or urban
community level should the latter wish to have a contract just for their area.

1.4.3 OPTIMISATION AND TRADING
ACTIVITIES

1.4.3.1. Role and activities of the Upstream/
Downstream Optimisation & Trading

Division (DOAAT)

DOAAT is responsible for managing the balance of EDF's upstream/
downstream electricity portfolio, optimising the electricity gross margin
created by this portfolio, as well as managing the associated physical and
financial risks.

Management of electricity supply/demand can be broken down from real-
time to three years in advance, within the framework set by the policies
of extreme risk (volume risks) and of price risks, developed pursuant to
the directives of the Group Risk Control Department, and validated by its
Executive Committee (see section 2.1.2 “Risks associated to the Group's
activities”). For example, a drop in temperature of 1°C in winter leads to
an increase in the consumption of electricity in France in the region of
2,400MW?, and the amplitude of hydraulic generation between two extreme
years may reach around 20TWh. Thus, in order to address the “volume risk”,
DOAAT ensures that it has, in all time frames, sufficient power margins
in order to enable it to meet its commitments in nearly all situations. It
possesses a set of leverage actions: scheduling of maintenance operations
of generation means (in particular nuclear), management of inventory (fossil
fuels, hydraulic reserves and customer load shedding), purchases and sales
in wholesale markets via EDF Trading, which is in charge of market access
on behalf of DOAAT (see section 1.4.6.3 “Optimisation and trading: EDF
Trading”). DOAAT also manages the exposure of EDF's upstream/downstream
portfolio to price variations in the energy wholesale markets (electricity, gas,
coal, petroleum products) and in the CO, emissions licensing market, with
the assistance of EDF Trading.

With respect to RTE, DOAAT plays the role of “balance responsible entity”
on EDF's perimeter in mainland France. In this regard, EDF is committed to
financially compensate RTE in the case of a deviation onto its balance group.
The optimisation consists of communicating to RTE an offer schedule that
is balanced with the demand for the day after, which makes it possible to
minimise the supply cost of EDF’s contractual commitments. In addition,
DOAAT analyses and evaluates the impact on the physical and financial
balance of the “generation-supply” portfolio (C+P) of regulatory and
institutional changes.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

1.4.3.2 Long-term electri
and sales contracts

EDF maintains commercial relations through numerous energy purchase or
sales contracts with European operators.

These contracts are of many types, and confer:

™ rights to the energy produced by facilities, primarily nuclear, in which
the counterparties hold a participating interest over the duration of the
exploitation of the facility (see section 1.4.1.1.1 “EDF's nuclear fleet” —
“Generation allocation contracts”);

= drawing rights for totally or partially guaranteed electrical power, for a
duration generally comprised between 15 and 25 years.

1.4.3.3 Regulated access to historic nuclear
power (Accés Régulé a I’Energie
Nucléaire Historique, or ARENH)

Operational since 1 July 2011, the ARENH mechanism entitles competing
suppliers to buy electricity from EDF, once they have signed a framework
agreement, at a regulated price and at volumes determined by the Energy
Regulation Commission (CRE). This mechanism can also be accessed by
network operators for their losses. The CRE is responsible for managing
the mechanism and for calculating entitlements of which it notifies the
co-contracting parties. Thus, suppliers wishing to exercise their right to
access the ARENH submit a request to the CRE, sending it forecasts of their
customers’ consumption. The detailed forecasts, along with the entitlements.
calculated for each supplier, are only known to the CRE and the supplier.
The payments are managed by the Caisse des Dépdts et Consignations.

The ARENH price is regulated. A draft decree setting out the methodology
for determining the ARENH price was reviewed by the Higher Energy Council
(Conseil Supérieur de I’Energie) on 19 June 2014, and subsequently sent to
the European Commission where it is currently being examined. Pending
the completion of this work, the government decided in its press release of
4 November 2014 to keep the current ARENH price at €42/MWh.

Article L. 336-8 of the Energy Code provides for an assessment of the
implementation of the ARENH mechanism and of its impact on competition
and the operation of the wholesale market, in 2015 and subsequently every
five years. This assessment is presented by the government to the Parliament
on the basis of the reports from the CRE and the Competition Authority. At
31 December 2015, the findings of this assessment hadn't been released
by the competent authorities yet.

1.4.3.4 Balance group dedicated
to the Purchase Obligations
and selling on the wholesale market

EDF is a mandatory purchaser of the electricity generated by the generation
facilities the government wishes to support and develop (renewable energy
sources and energy efficient cogeneration). By law (Article L. 121-7 of the
Energy Code), the additional costs stemming from this obligation are offset
for EDF on the basis of an electricity market benchmark price (concept of
“avoided cost”).

At its meeting of 9 October 2012 on the costs for 2011, the CRE indicated
that: “In theory, the avoided cost should be reduced by the imbalance costs
borne by EDF due to the unpredictable nature of a portion of the generation
covered by the purchase obligation. Such imbalances, which were negli¢
in past years compared with consumption-related imbalances, are becoming
more significant.”

With the development of renewable energies, the cost generated by the
difference between anticipated generation and actual generation has
become significant. As a result, at its meeting of 16 December 2014, the
CRE changed the formula for calculating EDF's avoided costs to include such
imbalance costs. In order to make objective and independently identify such
imbalances, the CRE asked EDF to establish a balance group dedicated to
the facilities subject to a Purchase Obligations contract.

44 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

This dedicated balance group was established on 1 July 2015, and DOAAT
is now organising the sale of energy generated by the facilities under a
Purchase Obligations contract directly on the energy markets. This allows
such energy to be managed independently of EDF's own portfolio. Thus,
since 4 November 2015, electricity volumes under Purchase Obligations
that can be forecast over the short-term (one day for the next, known as
the “random component of the Purchase Obligations”) are sold on EPEX
Spot. Since January 2016, volumes that can be forecast over the long-term
(known as the almost certain component of the Purchase Obligations) are
sold under transparent, non-discriminatory calls for tender.

1.4.3.5 Preparation of the future capacity
mechanism

Articles L. 335-1 et seq. of the Energy Code, which are taken from the NOME
Law (New Organization of the Electricity Market — nouvelle organisation du
marché de |’électricité), obligate each electricity supplier to contribute to the
security of electricity supply on continental metropolitan territory, in light of
its customers’ energy consumption patterns. Each supplier must therefore
provide guarantees of load shedding and electricity generation capacities,
which can be implemented to ensure balance between generation and
consumption, in particular at peak periods.

To comply with this obligation, each supplier must therefore get capacity
guarantees from producers, which must certify all their means of generation,
or from demand response managers.

Anew market will come into being to back such transactions with capacity
guarantees. The mechanism thus creates a new commodity that, for EDF,
is managed by DOAAT.

The first year of delivery is expected to be the 2017 calendar year, although
there is currently a possibility that the implementation of the mechanism
will be delayed.

In 2015, DOAAT certified most of EDF's means of generation for the 2017,
2018 and 2019 delivery years. Similarly, it is carrying out those for the
means of generation under Purchase Obligations. DOAAT is preparing to
operate in this newly created market in 2016 once the public authorities
have approved the start of trading, against the background of the European
Commission’s announcement that it had started a formal investigation into
the French capacity mechanism. This market will allow EDF to manage its
annual positions established for each delivery year by its obligation volumes
and its certified volumes.

1.4.4 REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN FRANCE

1.4.4.1 Transmission - Réseau de Transport

d’Electricité (RTE)

Created on 1 July 2000 and a subsidiary since 1 September 2005, RTE (the
Electricity Transport Network) is the owner and operator of the French
electricity transmission network, which it operates, maintains and develops.
With over 100,000 kilometres of high and extra high voltage circuits and
50 cross-border lines, this is Europe's largest network. Its geographical
location places it at the core of the European electricity market. RTE
guarantees the correct operation and safety of the electricity system, and
provides free and fair access to all the network users. The company also
pays special attention to supporting the development of renewable sources
of energy in France and their integration into the electricity system, which
requires the development of the transmission network and interconnections.

RTE is wholly owned by EDF, but due to its specific conditions of governance
(see section 1.4.4.1.2 “Organisation of RTE”), RTE wasn't fully consolidated
by the Group but rather consolidated using the equity method. It should be
noted that 50% of its shares were allocated to the asset portfolio dedicated
to financing the dismantling of nuclear power plants.

2015 energy balance

2015 was generally a warm year in France, although less than in 2014.
Accordingly, gross consumption in mainland France settled at 475.4TWh,
a 2.2% increase on 2014.

The peak annual electricity consumption occurred during a cold spell with
91.6GW on 6 February 2015, similar to levels in 2011 and 2013. Although
the 2012 thermal regulations will moderate future temperature sensitivity,
the sensitivity of consumption to temperature remains around 2,400MW/°C
in winter.

Adjusted for climate factors, consumption outside the energy sector, which
had been stable for three years, rose a modest 0.5% to 476.3TWh. Due to
the growing penetration of renewable energies in the distribution networks,
the change in withdrawals adjusted for climate factors on the RTE network
no longer necessarily matches the consumption side, and has been falling
since 2011 (-0.6% in 2015 compared with 2014).

Industrial consumption is similar to the past three years at 67.6TWh, masking
varying trends across sectors.

1.4.4.1.1 Overall environment

Renewable energies continue to grow in order to foster
the energy transition

Wind power exceeded the threshold of 10,000MW of installed capacity
in 2015. Wind power generation was up 23.3% (to 21.1TWh) on 2014,
and maximum wind power capacity exceeded 5,500MW every month of
the year. A new record hourly wind generation was even set at 1 p.m. on
29 March 2015, with a capacity of 8,266MW, representing a load factor of
86.3%, while daily generation peaked on 29 November 2015 (at 184GWh).

In 2015, 895MW of solar capacity was connected in mainland France, raising
installed solar capacity to 6,200MW. Around a quarter of this increase stems
from the commissioning, in September 2015, on the RTE network of the
Constantin farm at Cestas in Gironde, currently the largest photovoltaic
solar farm in Europe.

French exports remain high due to continued low prices

The balance of trade is positive across all French borders. It totalled 61.7TWh,
exceeding the 60TWh threshold for the third time in the past ten years.
The new Baixas — Santa Llogaia interconnection, which has gradually been
put into commercial operation since 5 October 2015, increases the transit
capacities with Spain. France's trade surplus with Spain was 7.3TWh.

France continues to have a trade surplus with Switzerland (13.9TWh).

The trade surplus was 19.7TWh with Italy, where the interconnection is
saturated 78% of the time, and 14.1TWh with the United Kingdom, where
the interconnection is saturated 86% of the time. New interconnection
projects are in particular being planned on these two borders.

RTE is a public limited company (société anonyme) with an Executive Board
and Supervisory Board.

RTE's Supervisory Board is comprised of twelve members appointed for
five years:

= eight members appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting:

= four government representatives, including the State as a legal entity,
represented by an individual,

= four representatives of the shareholder;
= four members elected by the staff.

A Government Commissioner was also appointed and attends Supervisory
Board meetings in a consultative capacity.

RTE's Executive Board is made up of five members, who perform their work
under the supervision of the Supervisory Board, within the limits fixed by
the French Energy Code and RTE’s articles of association. After the consent
of the Energy Minister, the Supervisory Board appoints the Chairman of
the Executive Board and upon the latter's proposal, it appoints the other
members of the Executive Board.

1.4.4.1.3 RTE’s activities

In France, RTE manages the public transmission network and carries out its
missions under the conditions set out in model specifications approved by
applicable decree until 2051. In accordance with the French Energy Code,
transmission network operators must be certified according to a process
associating the CRE and the European Commission, which aims to ensure
that the entity concerned fulfils the conditions of independence set out by
this text. RTE was certified by the CRE in 2012.

Thus RTE manages the transmission infrastructure, guarantees access to
the transmission network and manages energy flows.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

RTE has to face various challenges in its mission as operator of the power
transmission network: integration of the European market, extensive
restructuring of the generation fleet, societal changes reinforcing the
constraints of integrating new infrastructure of general interest and
maintenance of its industrial facilities for meeting the requirements of
customers and the community. To meet the requirements, RTE, with the
consent of the CRE, marked a new stage in terms of investments: investments
were increased to more than €1 billion annually between 2009 and 2013,
and more than €1.3 billion per year in 2014 and 2015. To perform its
missions, RTE has its own resources, consisting mainly of the tariff paid by
the network users. This tariff is established in a non-discriminatory manner
in order to cover all of RTE's costs, provided that these costs correspond to
costs for an efficient transmission manager, and fair return on the capital
invested across all the investment programmes approved by the CRE (see
section 1.4.4.4 “Tariffs for Using the Public Electricity Transmission and
Distribution Networks (TURPE)”).

1.4.4.1.3.1 Management of the transmission infrastructure

Maintenance

RTE manages the assets of the transmission network through daily
maintenance, emergency repairs and replacement of structures that are at
the end of their useful life or are damaged.

Following the storms of 1999, RTE implemented a mechanical safety
programme, which is now almost complete. Overall, from now until the end
of the programme in 2017, RTE should have dedicated a total of €2.4 billion
on making its network mechanically secure at an average expense of around
€160 million a year. This programme concerns 45,000 kilometres of aerial
lines of the RTE network.

In 2015, equivalent outage time for RTE customers was 7mn 02s. This
result incorporates the consequences of the heat wave that caused a whole
series of faults on instrument transformers between 30 June and 4 July
2015, resulting in significant outages for customers. These events, which
on their own accounted for 5mn 44s of outage time, obscure the good
results achieved otherwise.

Development and realisation of new investment
in the transmission network

Furthermore, RTE continues to develop and renew the network. The projects
studied and implemented fall within the dynamics of the growing need to
meet the challenges of energy transition. RTE draws up an annual investment
programme that is submitted to the CRE. In 2015, RTE's total investments.
amounted to €1,402 million (within the scope regulated by the CRE). The
main investments involved the reconstruction of the 400kV Charleville-Reims
line, the commencement of construction work on the French side of the
direct current link between France and Italy (Savoy-Piedmont) passing through
the Fréjus safety tunnel, the completion of construction work on the direct
current line reinforcing the interconnection between France and Spain in the
eastern Pyrenees (the commercial capacity of which was put on the market in
October 2015), along with the ongoing work to replace conductors making
it possible to secure flows along the 400kV Montélimar-Lyon line. Almost
30% of investments in network structures involved restoration aiming at
maintaining service quality.

RTE’s 2016 investment programme approved by the regulator amounts to
€1,550 million. The 2016 investment programme concerns the continuation
of significant investment in developing and renewing the network, as well
as developing and updating the IT systems, in particular in light of the
changing environment associated with the energy transition and European
market integration.

RTE's investments are also made in a context of growing needs for meeting
the challenges of maintaining the power supply security level, acceptance
of new generation means (including intermittent renewable sources of
energy), integration of European electricity markets and gradual increase
in the need to renew infrastructures.

In 2015, the Regulated Assets Base (RAB) increased by €411 million, up from
€12,826 million as at 1 January 2015 to €13,237 million as at 1 January
2016 '. For the record, the RAB is remunerated by the tariff at the Weighted
Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 7.25% before taxes. It represents RTE’s
industrial assets, after deduction of investment subsidies, and is calculated
excluding property, plant and equipment in progress (which until the end of
2012 were remunerated at 4.8% by the TURPE 3 tariff, and are at 4.6% for
the period from 2013-2016 in accordance with the CRE’s pricing decision
of April 2013).

1.4.4.1.3.2 Management of energy flows

Cost allocation

The cost corresponding to the adjustments made by RTE and due to the
negative differences between the projected flows and those already realised
is passed on to the “Balance responsible entities” (producers, traders,
suppliers, etc.) in proportion to their difference. In the case of a positive
difference, RTE compensates the balance responsible entities financially.

Interconnections

RTE manages access to international interconnections in collaboration
with the neighbouring European transmission network operators. These
interconnections make it possible to ensure the transit of energy from one
country to another and the operating safety of the electricity transmission
networks, to develop the European electricity market, by enabling an
electricity supplier to sell its energy to a customer in another European Union
country, by taking advantage of the differences in the timing of peak load
on either side of the border, and to better pool the means of generation
at the European level.

France-Spain interconnection

INELFE (Electric interconnection between France-Spain), a Franco-Spanish
company owned 50/50 by RTE and its Spanish counterparty REE (Red
Electrica de Espafia), was created in October 2008 to carry out the whole
interconnection project between the two countries. A new +320kV line
was commissioned in October 2015, doubling the prior electricity exchange
capacity between the Iberian peninsula and the rest of Europe, from
1,400MW to 2,800MW.

An agreement signed in 2011 between the European Investment Bank
(EIB), INELFE, REE and RTE, provided for EIB’s participation in financing the
project through a €350 million loan granted to the two network managers,
contributing half of the total €700 million budget. Furthermore, financing
of the interconnection received a €225 million subsidy granted by the
European Union in accordance with the EEPR prograrnme (European Energy
Program for Recovery).

Network coordination in Europe

In December 2008, RTE and ELIA? created a common company named
Coreso, which aims to coordinate the operation of electricity networks
comprising France and Belgium. The creation of Coreso fulfils the need of
reinforcing the operational coordination between transmission network
operators (TNO) expressed both by the European Commission and by the
players of the electricity market. Coreso must allow better integration of the
original renewable energy generation at the regional level and guarantee
secure management of rising cross-border flows.

1. Amounts still to be confirmed by the CRE, calculated on the basis of what has been realised.
2. Elia is the Belgian high voltage electricity transmission network operator (30,000 to 380,000 volts).

National Grid, the british network operator, Terna and 50 hertz, transmission
network operators in Italy and Northern and Eastern Germany, and more
recently REN, the Portuguese network operator, joined Coreso.

1.4.4.1.3.3 RTE’s international activities

RTE International, a subsidiary of RTE created in September 2006, is RTE’s
interface for all engineering and consultancy services outside France, in
response either to invitations to call for tenders or individual solicitations.

RTE pursues a strategy of development and geographical diversification of
its international services.

Electrical losses are inherent to the distribution network and mainly result
from physical effects which are directly dependent on the amount of
electricity delivered. ERDF must compensate these losses to complete the
amount of energy delivered to the final customers. In 2015, losses amounted
to 22.9TWh, i.e. a rate of 6.2% of electricity injected into the network.
The cost borne by ERDF to offset losses in 2015 was €1,137 million. To
compensate these losses, ERDF buys the corresponding electricity from the
wholesale market, either through organised market platforms, or through
calls for tender open to around 20 qualified suppliers. Since 2014, ERDF
benefits from ARENH deliveries for its electricity purchases to offset its losses,
up to around 6.4TWh in 2015.

Technical specifications: the distribution network ERDF is the concession
holder of (see section 1.4.4.2.2 “Distribution activities”) is, at 31 December
2015, made up of around:

= 631,400 kilometres of A-type high-voltage (HVA) lines of 20,000 volts;
= 709,500 kilometres of low-voltage (LV) lines of 400 volts;

m 2,251 HVB/HVA source substations;

= 774,500 HVA/LV transformer substations.

1.4.4.2.1 Organisation of ERDF

Distribution activities on French soil are, pursuant to the legal framework,
almost exclusively conducted by ERDF, a French public limited company
(société anonyme) with an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board
responsible for the management of the public electricity distribution network.

Distribution France (ERDF)

ERDF's main objective is to operate and develop the public electricity
distribution network, guaranteeing its security and safety, and overseeing the
balance of electricity flows at all times. ERDF, a wholly owned EDF subsidiary
in charge of the distribution business, has been operational since 1 January
2008. It services around 95% of the continental metropolitan population.
The remaining 5% are provided by Local Distribution Companies (LDCs).

In 2015, ERDF provided electricity to over 35.6 million customers (delivery
points) in mainland France through a network of about 1.3 million kilometres.

At 31 December 2015, ERDF employed 39,033 people.

Pursuant to Directive no. 2003/54/EC, the principles of which are applied
in Directive no. 2009/72/EC of 13 July 2009, when the manager of the
public distribution network is part of a vertically integrated company, its
organisation and decision-making must be legally independent from other
activities not related to distribution. Within this framework, the principle
adopted by EDF and Gaz de France, now Engie, led them to spin out their
distribution network. The two subsidiaries ERDF and GRDF share a “common
service” pursuant to the legal framework (see section 1.4.4.2.3 “Service
shared by ERDF and GRDF”).

Pursuant to the Law of 9 August 2004, the business of public electricity
distribution network operator was turned into a subsidiary in 2007.

The ERDF Supervisory Board is made up of 15 members, eight of whom are
appointed by the Ordinary General Meeting, five of whom are employee
representatives elected in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 83-675
of 26 July 1983 on the democratisation of the public sector, and two of
whom are State representatives. The ERDF Executive Board is made up
of five members who perform their work under the supervision of the
Supervisory Board.

In application of the option provided for in Order no. 2014-948 of 20 August
2014 (Article 15) and pursuant to Decree no. 2015-38 of 19 January 2015,
the State appointed, through a decision of 4 February 2015, a Government
commissioner to attend the sessions of the ERDF Supervisory Board.

In few months, ERDF will change its branding name. This new name will
reflect the company’s strong commitment to the energy transition in the
wake of COP 21. This will also enable the electricity distribution network
operator to raise its profile and clarify its mission, as intended by the CRE.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

ERDF missions in France

ERDF, pursuant to the conditions set by law and the concession contracts
signed with each of the public electricity distribution contracting authorities
(see section 1.4.4.2.2 “Distribution activities”), performs its missions as the
public distribution network operator in mainland France.

These missions are:

= define and implement operational, investment and development policies
in relation to the electricity distribution network;

= provide connection and access for users to these networks under
objective, transparent and non-discriminatory conditions, as well as
inter-connection with other networks;

= provide users with the information needed to access the network
efficiently (information protected by regulations or law excepted);

™ oversee relations with the energy regulation authorities (Ministry of
Energy, the Energy Regulation Commission (CRE — Commission de
Régulation de I’Energie), public distribution contracting authorities) in
line with its activities;

™ oversee relations with local authorities;

™ negotiate, conclude and manage concession contracts;

™ operate, service and repair the electricity distribution networks;

= design and build infrastructure, as well as manage work on the networks;

GROSS INVESTMENTS OF ERDF

™ carry out metering activities for users connected to the networks,
particularly as regards supply, installation, meter inspection, maintenance
and renewal of metering devices, as well as managing data activities
and any other missions relating to its work as a whole;

® provide services for the LDCs, distributors and organising authorities
mentioned respectively in sections Ill and IV of Article L. 2224-31 of the
French Local Authorities Code.

1.4.4.2.2 Distribution activities

ERDF's business is based on a number of activities: manage, in its capacity
as the concession holder, the assets under concession; run and maintain
the network in such a way as to ensure the continuity of supply; carry out
work on the network (in particular, network connection, reinforcement and
renewal work); provide access to the network to all users in the framework
of contractual provisions in force; and manage the meter fleet, as well as
obtaining, processing and transmitting data on network user consumption.

Change in investments

In 2015, ERDF invested €3.2 billion, €1.4 billion of which were mainly
devoted to connections for new customers and producers, as well as to
the reinforcement of the network. In addition, the contracting authorities
invested €789 million in 2015. In all, almost €4 billion were invested on the
distribution networks in 2015 in mainland France.

The supplementary resources thus committed are devoted to the quality of
service provision, to securing the networks, to safety, and to the preservation
of the environment, areas where the identified expectations of customers,
local authorities and contracting authorities are particularly high.

This level of investment allows ERDF to carry out asset renewal programmes.

To complement these investments, ERDF continues to increase the budgets
for the preventative maintenance of networks, in particular for work relating
to downsizing. This budget amounted to €342 million in 2015 (versus
€334 million in 2014 and €273 million in 2013).

The Public Service Contract and environmental
and aesthetic concerns

In order to meet the objectives of the Public Service Contract as well as
environmental and aesthetic objectives, ERDF committed to burying 90%
of new A-type high-voltage (HVA) lines and to using a “discreet technique”
(twisted cable on building facades) for two-thirds of new low-voltage (LV)
lines. ERDF does not intend to bury the entire network. Like an overhead
network, an underground network remains subject to power outage risks:
it can suffer from external assaults (heat waves, flooding, works, etc.) and
the time needed to locate an incident and resupply customers is generally
longer than in the case of an overhead network.

1. PCT (Portion Covered by the Tariff): portion paid to project manager contractors from the contributions to the delivery tariff for financing a connection.
2. Article 8 of Annex 1 of the concession specifications relating to the integration of works into the environment (for example the works to bury lines).

48 EDF | 2015 Reference Document


--- Page 38 ---

In 2015, ERDF built over 98.2% of new underground medium-voltage lines
and over 80.8% of new underground or discreet low-voltage lines. It thus
went beyond its commitment to the State regarding the reduction of the
visual impact of networks installed under its supervision.

Quality of service

Quality of service is one of ERDF’s main objectives. In 2015, the average
outage time excluding transmission incidents and excluding exceptional
incidents was 61.1 minutes. This is the best result in ten years. The quality
of service provided is also reflected by maintaining steady voltage levels,
kept as close as possible to the level set by regulations, and by minimising
the number of outages.

As regards the quality of voltage, in 2015 over 99% of customers were
considered as “well supplied” in terms of the regulations in force.

To respond to large scale incidents, ERDF relies on a Rapid Intervention Force
(FIRE) which allows it to mobilise, at any time, in an affected region, the teams
and resources from other regions in order to restore customers’ electricity
as rapidly as possible. In 2015, the FIRE team was mobilised in early July to
repair the underground networks affected by the heat wave in the lle-de-
France, Provence - Alpes - Céte d’Azur and Lyon regions, and subsequently
at end-August, following the storms that affected the South-West.

As regards insurance cover for the protection of the overhead distribution
network against the effects of large scale storms, see section 2.2.7.5.3
“Storm cover".

Development of renewable energies

Across the scope of ERDF activities, the number of photovoltaic generation
facilities connected to the grid increased once again: at the end of 2015,
5,217MW from photovoltaic facilities were connected (compared with
4,590MW at the end of 2014), which represented around 338,000 facilities
(versus 321,000 at end-2014). The development of wind power generation
connected to the public distribution network also continued, and more than
9,191MW were connected at the end of 2015.

At end-2015, a total of 14.4GW in photovoltaic and wind power generation
was connected to the ERDF grid, respectively made up of 5.2GW from
photovoltaic plants and 9.1GW from wind power generation. To the power
thus generated are added other sources of power generation, in particular
“historical” hydropower plants (1.5GW), cogeneration (1.8GW), biogas,
biomass and dispatchable fossil-fuel thermal. In all, at the end of 2015, the
generation fleet connected to ERDF was around 19.3GW.

Electricity market

The French electricity sales market has been open to competition for all
customers since 1* July 2007.

36 electricity suppliers operate on the French market. They have signed a
contract with ERDF establishing the terms and conditions for the supplier and
the distributor in the event that a customer subscribes to a single contract
covering the supply and delivery of electricity.

ERDF took steps to achieve, for sites with subscribed power in excess of
36kKVA, the end of regulated sales tariffs and their transition to market
offers. To this end, ERDF put in place a national project structure designed
to adjust metering to market offers by the deadline. The main projects
underway involved the supplier change procedure, the roll-out of operating
procedures, the roll-out of meters, the adaptation of IT systems and the
preparation for a burst in activity at the end of 2015.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Concessions

At 31 December 2015, ERDF and EDF were co-concession holders of 580
concessions contracts, covering around 95% of the population.

In France, public electricity distribution is operated under a concession
plan that derogates from common law on local public service concessions.
Pursuant to the provisions of the law, contracting authorities own the
distribution networks, which are return property '. The concession contracts
are generally concluded for a period of 20 to 30 years.

The development and the operation of public distribution networks
(streamlined service for the country by the public distribution networks;
connection and access, under non-discriminatory conditions, to the public
distribution networks) are entrusted, pursuant to the French Energy Code
(Article L. 121-4), to ERDF, to EDF in areas not inter-connected to mainland
France, and to LDCs in the areas where they are exclusive service providers.

Pursuant to Article L. 334-3 of the French Energy Code, ongoing concession
contracts are considered as jointly signed by the contracting authority (local
authority or public cooperation institution), by EDF (or territorially competent
LDC) for the regulated tariff supply portion, and by ERDF (or territorially
competent LDC) for the distribution network portion. When concession
contracts are renewed or amended, they are co-signed according to these
terms.

See also section 1.5.6.2.7 “Regulations that are applicable to publics
markets”.

1.4.4.2.3 Service shared by ERDF and GRDF

The service shared by ERDF and GRDF, defined by Article L. 111-71 of the
French Energy Code, sets out, in the electricity and gas distribution sector, to
build installations, manage works projects, operate and provide maintenance
for the networks, and conduct metering operations. It does not have the
status of a legal entity.

ERDF and GRDF are related through a convention that sets out their relations
in the framework of this common service, the scope of said service and the
sharing of costs resulting from it. Concluded for an open-ended period, it
can be revoked at any time, provided a prior notice of 18 months is given,
during which the parties commit to renegotiating.

In November 2011, ERDF and GRDF signed a protocol agreement describing
each distributor's role in the target vision of a common service organisation.
The opening of markets and the differentiation of processes led to changes
and specialisation of the organisation of certain activities. To date, ERDF
has favoured organisation through the regional directorates integrating all
its operational missions at local level. A more detailed fabric is reserved for
local activities. Certain activities, such as metering and logistical activities, are
carried out in common in view of the resulting efficiency gains generated.

1.4.4.2.4 Future challenges (replacement,
development, smart meters)

Smart grids and smart meters

ERDF, guarantor of the electricity distribution public service, invests at all times
to develop, modernise and secure the electrical network. The adaptation
of the electricity grid to the new needs of society is a major strategic
challenge. To achieve this, ERDF is developing the Linky system, based on
anew generation of meters, called “smart meters” that can receive orders
and send data without the physical involvement of a technician. This system
is the first stage of the smart grids.

. Return property is that which is essential to carrying out the licensed service. Such property is deemed as belonging to the contracting local authority from the start. The

concession contract foresees their mandatory restitution to the contracting local authority at the end of the concession.

EDF | 2015 Reference Document 49


--- Page 39 ---

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

After a successful pilot phase, which was validated by the public authorities,
almost 300,000 Linky meters are in operation in Lyon and Touraine. On
1 December 2015, ERDF started the first phase of the Linky meter roll-out.
The first phase consists of installing 3 million meters between December 2015
and the end of 2016 year. The goal is to replace 90% of the old meters in
35 million homes in France by 2021.

Foster energy transition

Concurrently, ERDF is conducting large scale testing of a number of solutions
to provide a deeply modernised network to consumers and companies.
This research and development work covers the operation of low- and
medium-voltage networks, the integration of renewable energies and electric
vehicles, storage management, voltage stability, etc. ERDF is steering and/or
supporting around 15 demonstrators in France and Europe with a diverse set
of partners — industrialists, SMEs, start-ups and universities. The challenge for
the distributor is to support energy transition while developing the networks
at the lowest cost for society. Thanks to new technologies, a more detailed
and responsive oversight is possible, based on a better understanding of
consumption, generation and the state of the network. This “intelligence”
makes it possible to avoid over-investment by adjusting it to consumption
peaks, while guaranteeing the reliability of the network, pursuant to ERDF's
double public service objective of performance and security.

MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IES

Since the end of 2011, ERDF has coordinated the “GRID4EU” programme.
This programme brings together a consortium of six European distributors
(ERDF, Enel, Iberdrola, CEZ, Vattenfall and RWE); it contributes to exploring
the potential of smart grids in the fields of renewable energy integration,
electric vehicle development, network automation, energy storage, energy
efficiency and disruption solutions.

1.4.4.3 Island Energy Systems

Island Energy Systems (IES) cover the electrical systems operated by EDF which
are not inter-connected, or are marginally connected, to the mainland: mainly
Corsica, the overseas departments (excluding Mayotte) and the overseas
territories of Saint-Barthélemy, Saint-Martin and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon.

This situation notably implies that generation surcharges, which the legislator
considers as a public service expense, are offset by the Contribution to
the Public Electricity Service (see section 1.5.2 “Public service in France”).

EDF's organisation in each of these regions is therefore based on maintaining
an integrated structure, providing both most of the generation and the entire
range of functions of supply and demand balance manager, of network
manager (HVB, HVA and LV) and of supplier.

EDF is the main actor in these regions in terms of electricity generation.

In view of the difference within these systems between the megawatt-hour
generation costs and the sale price at the equalised tariff, EDF's sales activities
look to implement, alone or in partnership with the Agency for Environment
and Energy Management (Agence de /Environnement et de la Maitrise de
l'Energie or ADEME) and local institutions, energy efficiency actions.

Changes and outlook

Investments to modernise and reinforce the electricity
generation fleet with guaranteed capacity

The 2009 Multi-year Electricity Generation Investment Programme (PPI) set
the objective of implementing electricity generation at guaranteed capacity
for Corsica and the overseas departments at 1,166MW by 2020. The 2009
PPI moreover foresaw the renewal of almost all the existing diesel plants.

The EDF group thus undertook to replace its main end-of-life plants, also
built and operated by the EDF PEI subsidiary.

The four diesel plant construction projects were successfully completed
between 2012 and 2015, involving a total capacity of close to 750MW: Port-
Est in Réunion, Bellefontaine B in Martinique, Pointe-Jarry in Guadeloupe and
Lucciana B in Northern Corsica. These new generation resources, equipped
with innovative technologies, will allow the Group to deliver better industrial
and environmental results and contribute to satisfying a part of the emerging
electricity demands in these regions.

In addition, the Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon plant (21MW), was refurbished in
2015 and inaugurated on 26 November 2015.

The extension to the Saint-Barthélemy plant (two new 16MW engines) has
been operational since 2014.

The construction of the Saint-Martin plant is ongoing, with completion
scheduled for the first half of 2016.

EDF invested €158 million in IES electricity generation in 2015.

Investments in electricity networks

The continued growth in consumption in these regions despite the energy
efficiency actions undertaken, as well as the development of renewable
energies, have led the EDF group to continue the reinforcement of the
electricity networks. In Corsica as in the overseas departments with natural
fleets, some of the new high-voltage connections will be built using
underground or underwater techniques.

EDF thus invested €175 million in networks in 2015.

A commitment to projects devoted to a better integration

of renewable energies in the electricity generation mix

and to optimising the management of electrical systems

The EDF group supports the emergence and development of electricity

generation methods based on renewable energies adapted to IES. The
methods favoured are those that provide abundant and guaranteed energy

at competitive generation costs sustainable in the long term, in such a way
as to position them as credible alternatives to thermal generation: biomass,
marine and river energies, waste recovery, biogas. Studies are also underway
on the use of LNG to substitute fuel oil.

EDF also contributes to making advances in technical capacities relating to
the insertion of intermittent renewable energies into IES and is committed
to experimental projects on smart grids in partnership with other industry
actors, research laboratories and the ADEME.

1.4.4.4 Tariffs for Using the Public Electricity
Transmission and Distribution Networks
(TURPE)

transmission network

Pursuant to Article L. 341-3 of the French Energy Code, the tariff for using
the public electricity transmission network is set by way of a reasoned
decision of the CRE. The current tariff for using the public transmission
network (TURPE 4 HVB), set by the CRE decision of 3 April 2013, came
into force on 1 August 2013.

RTE's tariff revenues were thus up 2.4% at 1 August 2015. This tariff will be
changed on 1 August 2016 taking account of the impact of the mechanisms.
created by the Energy Transition for Green Growth Law. As the TURPE 4
HVB was meant to apply for a period of around four years, the CRE began
working on a new tariff for using the public electricity transmission network
(TURPE 5 HVB), which will come into force in summer 2017.

Financial compensation of RTE’s assets is obtained by multiplying the
amount of the regulated assets base (RAB), estimated at €12,826 million at
1 January 2015, by a fixed rate of compensation corresponding to a nominal
rate before tax of 7.25% for the 2013-2016 tariff period. In addition, the
repayment to network users of overpayments prior to 2013, via regulation
mechanisms, moderates the tariff.

On this basis, in 2015, network access tariff revenues were around
€4,085 million for the electricity transmission network, revenues from services
€95 million and revenues from interconnections €460 million.

As regards the transmission and distribution of natural gas (Law no. 2003-08
of 3 January 2003), see section 1.5.3.2 “French legislation: Energy Code”.

distribution networks

Over 90% of ERDF sales are made up of revenues made from transmission.
The tariff for using the public electricity network (TURPE), in terms of levels
and structure, is set by the CRE in a transparent and non-discriminatory
manner, in order to cover all the costs borne by the network operators.

At 1 August 2015, the TURPE increased 0.4%.

1.4.5.1 United Kingdom

EDF group activity in the United Kingdom (UK) is led by EDF Energy focusing
on energy supply and electricity generation. The Group is also active in oil and
gas exploration and production in the North Sea with EDF Production UK, a

subsidiary of Edison (see sections 1.4.6.2.2.3 “Exploration and Production
(E&P)” and 1.4.5.2.3.2 “Hydrocarbon business”).

EDF Energy is one of the UK's largest energy companies and the largest
producer of low-carbon electricity. The company produces around one-fifth
of the nation’s electricity from its nuclear power stations, wind farms, coal
and gas power stations and combined heat and power plants.

The company supplies gas and electricity to 5.6 million business and
residential customer accounts and is the biggest supplier of electricity by
volume in Great Britain.

1. Source: Elexon Reporting.
2. According to the available data, excluding Northern Ireland.

52 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

EDF Energy plans to build four new nuclear plants, subject to the right
investment framework. These new plants could generate enough low carbon
electricity for about 40% of Britain’s homes.

It employs around 14,000 people at sites throughout the country. The
workforce is highly engaged with 83% taking part in the annual employee
survey with an engagement index score of 76%. 79% would recommend
EDF Energy as a good place to work and are proud to tell people where
they work. 90% of employees go the ‘extra mile’ to ensure the success
of EDF Energy.

In 2015, EDF Energy maintained its position as the largest generator of
electricity (by TWh produced) and of low carbon electricity ', and overall as
the leading electricity supplier in Great Britain (by TWh sold’).

1.4.5.1.1 Strategy

The vision for EDF Energy for 2030 starts with customers and their needs.
Hence its strategy, which aims at ensuring a sustainable long-term business,
is focused on supporting the transition to a lower-carbon economy through
generation of safe, reliable and affordable low-carbon electricity. Equally, EDF
Energy seeks to meet customer needs in an efficient, simple and responsible
way, enabling customers to control their energy usage. All of their actions
are underpinned by a focus on improving cost efficiency across the business.

In its customer-facing business, EDF Energy aims to be the energy partner
of choice for residential and business customers, helping them to make
the most of their energy consumption and production and of their
increasingly connected, smart homes (and similarly connected public
buildings, communities and cities), whilst providing excellent service and
convenience. Through innovation and digitalisation, the company seeks to
help customers control and save energy and to deliver attractive low-carbon
solutions thus ensuring a competitive offering to customers is maintained
in a rapidly evolving market.

In generation, EDF Energy seeks to create value through continued
operational excellence of existing assets and by developing a portfolio of
new investments. This includes leading the revival of nuclear new build in
the UK. In partnership with China General Nuclear Corporation (CGN),
EDF plans to build two new nuclear units at Hinkley Point in Somerset, and
to work together to develop further new nuclear proposals at Sizewell in
Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. EDF Energy is also continuing to develop
new renewable generation (mainly onshore wind) projects and maintains
consideration of options for new, flexible gas-fired generation.

EDF Energy aims to secure value from its existing nuclear, coal and gas assets
through continued safe and reliable generation. A key strategic programme
is securing lifetime extensions for existing nuclear plant, when safe and
commercially viable, to allow the UK to continue to benefit from nuclear
energy until new low-carbon capacity can come online at scale. This will
also provide ongoing nuclear employment opportunities and support the
maintenance of skills in the UK nuclear industry. In February 2016, EDF Energy
confirmed a five year life extension for Hartlepool and Heysham 1 nuclear
power stations to 2024 and a further seven year life extension for Heysham
2 and Torness nuclear power stations to 2030. Other important strategic
actions concerning the company’s generation fleet include optimising the
lifetime value of coal generation capacity under the UK capacity market
mechanism and optimising the operations of the West Burton B Combined
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power station.

EDF Energy is organised into three main business units: Generation,
Customers, and Nuclear New Build.

1.4.5.1.2 Activities

1.4.5.1.2.1 Nuclear generation

EDF Energy owns and operates eight nuclear power stations in the UK with
a total capacity of 8.9GW. The Nuclear Generation business unit employs
over 5,500 people.

Since 2009, Centrica plc. (“Centrica”) has held a 20% shareholding in Lake
Acquisitions Limited, the company in which the nuclear generation assets
sit (except Nuclear New Build).

Nuclear generation fleet technology

Seven of the eight nuclear power stations are Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor
(AGR) power stations (Dungeness B, Hartlepool, Heysham 1, Heysham 2,
Hinkley Point B, Hunterston B and Torness) and the eighth is a Pressurised
Water Reactor (PWR) power station (Sizewell B).

Safety and radiological protection

Nuclear safety is EDF Energy's overriding priority (see section 3.2.2.2.1
“Nuclear safety”).

EDF Energy operates to strict procedures to minimise and control the radiation
doses received by employees and contractors at all of EDF Energy's existing
nuclear power stations. In 2015, the average individual dose received by
all workers on EDF Energy's existing nuclear sites was 0.067mSyv, the legal
dose limit being 20mSv per year. The highest individual dose received in
2015 was 7.8mSv.

The operating lifetime of the nuclear power plants

The actual lifetime of each power station will be determined primarily by
the technical and economic practicability of supporting its safety case.
This is assessed at each statutory outage for the following operating
period through inspection, maintenance, testing and assessment of plant
performance. Following the outage, consent is required from the Office
for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) before restarting the reactor. The operating
period between statutory outages is normally three years for the AGR power
stations and eighteen months for Sizewell B.

In addition, every ten years, the stations are subject to a more detailed and
wide ranging Periodic Safety Review (“PSR”), which must also be accepted
by the ONR in order to secure continued operation. Sizewell B was the last
station to be assessed, and it received its 10 year consent in January 2015.

EDF | 2015 Reference Document 53

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

The AGRs were designed with a nominal 25 year lifetime, and Sizewell
B with a 40 year lifetime. However, with the aggregation of technical
information, and operational and safety experience, it has been possible
to revise the expected AGR lifetimes. Prior to EDF Energy ownership, the
AGRs had been extended by an average of 10 years, and it has been EDF
Energy's intention, where possible and economic, to seek further lifetime
extensions. This may require additional investment in the plant, and requires
technical, safety, and economic justifications to be made; and since it
may result in increasing the nuclear liabilities, the consent of the Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority (NDA).

During EDF Energy ownership, the AGRs have been extended by an average
of eight years. The most recent extensions were declared in February 2016.
Hartlepool and Heysham 1 were extended by a further five years, and
Heysham 2 and Torness were extended by seven years.

Although the work has not yet been carried out to support the extension
of Sizewell B, the Company expects that it should be possible to extend
it by c.20 years.

The current station lives (as formally declared by the company and approved
by the NDA) and corresponding current scheduled closure dates of the power
stations in the Nuclear Generation Fleet are set out in the following table:

Operational review of the existing nuclear generation fleet

Output from the nuclear generation fleet for 2015 was 60.6TWh, which
was 4.4TWh higher than 2014 nuclear output of 56.3TWh. The increase
principally reflects lower unplanned losses across the fleet.

During 2015, a programme of planned outages was carried out on the
nuclear generation fleet. Statutory outages were completed on Dungeness B
Reactor 22, Heysham 1 Reactor 2, Heysham 2 Reactor 7, Hinkley Point B
Reactor 4, Hunterston B Reactor 3 and Torness Reactor 2.

Plant status

Following the discovery of a defect in a boiler spine on Heysham 1 Reactor 1
in 2014, all four reactors at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool have been operating
at reduced load to manage boiler temperatures in the affected area and
in the case of Heysham 1 Reactor 1 on three out of four boiler quadrants.

During 2015, modifications were carried out to the boiler cooling on all four
reactors to allow a return to full load. The boiler temperature constraint
has now been lifted on all four reactors. Heysham 1 Reactor 1 continues
to operate on three out of four boiler quadrants.

Radioactive Waste Management
In the UK, radioactive waste is classified as:

= Low Level Waste (LLW), for which a near surface disposal route exists for
LLW = Including the LLW Repository at Drigg West Cumbria;

= Intermediate Level Waste (ILW), for which no disposal route is currently
available in the UK;

® High Level Waste (HLW) is defined as radioactive waste in which the
temperature may rise significantly as a result of the radioactivity, so
this factor has to be taken into account in the design of storage and
disposal facilities.

These last two categories are merged under the Higher Activity Waste
(HAW) category, their final storage solutions being geological storage in
deep layers, that are not yet available in the UK.

EDF Energy nuclear generation's strategy for LLW and HAW reflects that
the UK and Scottish governments are focused on application of the waste
hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover). The use of a range of waste
recycling and disposal routes will help to make the best use of the UK’s
Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) in Cumbria. Only a disposal route for
LLW currently exists in the UK.

HAW is stored for the medium-term in safe, purpose built facilities at EDF
Energy's stations while longer term national solutions are being established
within England and Scotland.

Under historic contractual arrangements, spent fuel from the AGRs
is transported to Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site (owned by NDA)
for reprocessing or long term storage. Heat generating HAW from the
reprocessing of spent AGR fuel are converted into glass blocks for safe,
long term storage.

Regarding Sizewell B, the spent fuel is stored on site and EDF Energy is
currently building a further spent fuel dry storage facility on the Sizewell B
site to allow the station to continue to safely store all of the spent fuel that
will be generated over Sizewell B's life. Following long-term surface storage,
the Sizewell B PWR spent fuel will be disposed to a future UK Geological
Disposal Facility.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

The nature of EDF Energy nuclear generation’s business and its historic
government link means that the strategy for spent fuel and the management
of radioactive waste from EDF Energy nuclear generation’s power stations
is approved by the NDA. However EDF Energy has policies to continually
improve and minimise the spent fuel and waste arising through the company’s
wider safety, sustainability and environmental policies.

Costs relating to radioactive waste management
and decommissioning - Restructuring Agreements

Restructuring Agreements were originally entered into in 2005 as part of
the restructuring of the former British Energy Group of companies (hereafter
referred to as “the EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Group”) and were carried
out from 2002 under the aegis of the UK government in order to stabilise
the financial situation of the EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Group.

By virtue of these restructuring agreements:

m the Nuclear Liabilities Fund (NLF), an independent trust set up by the
UK government as part of the restructuring, agreed (at the direction of
the Secretary of State) to fund, to the extent of its assets: (i) qualifying
uncontracted nuclear liabilities (including liabilities in connection with
the management of spent fuel at the Sizewell B power station); and
(ii) qualifying costs of decommissioning in relation to the existing
nuclear power stations owned and operated by EDF Energy Nuclear
Generation Group;

m the Secretary of State agreed to fund: (i) qualifying uncontracted nuclear
liabilities (including liabilities in connection with the management
of spent fuel at the Sizewell B power station) and qualifying costs
of decommissioning, in each case in relation to the existing nuclear
power stations owned and operated by EENGG, to the extent that they
exceed the assets of NLF; and (ii) subject to a cap of £2,185 million
(in December 2002 monetary values, adjusted accordingly), qualifying
contracted liabilities for the EENGG's spent fuel (including in particular
liabilities for management of AGR waste from spent fuel loaded prior
to 15 January 2005); and

= EDF group is responsible for funding certain excluded or disqualified
liabilities (mainly liabilities incurred in connection with an unsafe or
careless operation of the power stations) and the potential associated
obligations of its subsidiaries to the NLF and the Secretary of State are
guaranteed by the principal members of the EENGG.

Certain companies in the EENGG, including EDF Energy Nuclear Generation
Limited, entered into a separate contract, now with the NDA for management
of AGR spent fuel loaded from 15 January 2005 (termed “new fuel”) and
have no responsibility/iability for this fuel after it is received at Sellafield.

The Secretary of State and EDF agreed to limited amendments to the
Restructuring Agreements, in connection with the acquisition of EENGG
by Lake Acquisitions. The amendments, among other things and subject to
limited exceptions, restrict the majority of rights and obligations imposed
by the Restructuring Agreements only to EENGG and its subsidiaries and
subsidiary undertakings and accordingly, do not extend similar rights and
obligations to EDF group, or its other subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings.
The amendments do not impact on the contractual funding commitments
of the Secretary of State or NLF to the EENGG.

Certain amendments have been made to the Restructuring Agreements,
reflecting the EENGG's access to an improved credit rating following the
acquisition. In particular, EENGG is required to maintain a minimum cash

DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

reserve. The amendments reduced the minimum level to £290 million.
The cash reserve may be further reduced to nil if the EENGG achieves and
maintains an investment grade rating or if irrevocable Committed Facilities of
the same amount are put in place between third party financial institutions
or a member of the wider EDF group with an investment grade rating and
a member of the EENGG.

1.4.5.1.2.2 Renewable generation

Through EDF Energy Renewables (EDF ER), a joint venture between EDF
Energy and EDF Energies Nouvelles, EDF Energy is developing its own
onshore and offshore assets. In addition, EDF Energy has signed power
purchase agreements with renewable generators and supports independent
developers. This ensures a balanced approach for compliance with its
Renewables Obligations (RO) and the provision of renewable electricity to
its customer base.

EDF ER currently operates 31 wind farm sites with a total generation capacity
of nearly GOOMW. In 2015, EDF ER brought into operation three onshore

1.4.5.1.2.3 Thermal generation and gas storage

windfarms: Burnhead Moss (26MW), Rhodders (12.3MW) and Park Spring
(8.6MW). In addition, EDF ER acquired during 2015 the development rights
to build a windfarm at Corriemoillie (more than 45MW) and at Dorenell,
which at 177MW is one of the largest onshore wind projects due to be
built in Scotland.

EDF ER’s pipeline of projects in the construction phase includes a windfarm
at Pearie Law (19.2MW) and a windfarm at Beck Burn (18MW), both of
which are onshore. They are expected to begin operation respectively during
2016 and 2017.

As part of the 80% sale of Glass Moor II, Rusholme and Green Rigg
windfarms to China General Nuclear Power Corporation, completed in
2014, EDF ER continues to provide asset management and operation and
maintenance activities for the wind farms.

EDF ER also has joint ventures in the renewables field with AMEC Foster
Wheeler, a construction group, to develop a c.130MW windfarm near
Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland.

(1) Open Cycle Gas Turbine.

In 2015, Cottam and West Burton A coal-fired power plants generated
15.7TWh of electricity. Although lower than last year, this represents a
good performance in a year of lower dark spreads, two major outages and
a number of unplanned losses, notably at Cottam power station. West
Burton B CCGT generated 6.2TWh, driven by strong availability performance
and improved market spark spreads.

The coal plant strategy has been developed to provide flexible generation
and meet EDF Energy's obligations of plant availability under the Capacity
Market Auction held in 2014. The coal plants secured a capacity agreement
of three years starting 2018 for seven of eight coal units at the clearing price
of £19.40/kW per year (2012 prices). West Burton A Unit 3 participated in
the 2015 Auction but did not secure a contract.

The decision regarding the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) route has
been taken and from 1 January 2016 both coal plants will operate under
the UK Transitional National Plan (TNP) which requires coal power stations
to comply with additional annual emissions limits for nitrogen oxides,
sulphur dioxide and dust.

West Burton B CCGT was successful in the 2014 Auction and was awarded
a1 year contract for 2018-2019 at the clearing price of £19.40/kW per year
(2012 prices). A further 1 year contract was secured in the 2015 Auction
round for 2019-2020 at a lower clearing price of £18.00/kW per year
(2014/15 prices). The same applies to the two OCGT units at West Burton A.

EDF Energy operates two fast cycle gas storage facilities in Cheshire. Hole
House was purchased from EDF Trading in April 2014; the asset is fully
operational with a total working gas capacity of c.18 million therms. Hill
Top Farm became commercially operational in mid January 2015 with three
cavities. The remaining two cavities are being developed and are scheduled
to come on-line by mid next year. In 2015 integration of these gas storage
activities into a single asset commenced and is continuing through 2016.

1.4.5.1.2.4 Customer business

The Customers business is responsible for the supply of gas and electricity
to residential and business customers across the United Kingdom and the
wholesale market optimisation of EDF Energy’s generation and customer
assets.

EDF Energy sells energy to two major customer segments: residential
customers, described as the Business to Customers segment (B2C); and
business customers, described as the Business to Business segment (B2B). The
size of business customers ranging from large industrial businesses to small
privately owned businesses. EDF Energy adopts different risk management
strategies for these two segments.

B2C

During the year, EDF Energy supplied 13.7TWh of electricity and supplied
27.6TWh of gas for the B2C segment. As at 31 December 2015, EDF
Energy had 3.3 million electricity accounts and 2.0 million gas accounts
‘on this segment.

Competition

The residential market has been exceptionally competitive in 2015, marked
by steep falls in wholesale energy costs that has allowed new and smaller
suppliers to offer a series of cheaper short term fixed priced tariffs. EDF
Energy constantly reviews its prices to ensure that its tariffs attract new
customers and offer good value to existing ones. During 2015 EDF Energy
has continued to expand its portfolio of fixed price Blue tariffs, backed by
low carbon nuclear generation. EDF Energy currently has 2.6 million product
accounts on Blue tariffs.

Regulatory Change

Some suppliers have responded to the increasingly competitive market by
attempting to segment their customer base through white label offers and/
or collective switches, the existence of which have not been notified to
existing customers. The regulator has now clamped down on both of these
practises to ensure that any cheaper tariff offered by a supplier is flagged
to existing customers. The outcome of the CMA inquiry is expected to have
a material impact upon the current regulations (see section 1.4.5.1.2.7
“United Kingdom Legal Environment”).

Energy Company Obligation

The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is an energy efficiency programme
which has been extended and will end on 31 March 2017 (see
section 3.2.3.6.1 “Contributing to energy access and the fight against
energy poverty”).

The government has announced a 5-year replacement programme which
will aim to improve the energy efficiency of ~200,000 homes p.a. and will be
targeted at fuel poor households. The government will consult on detailed
implementation of the new ECO programme in 2016.

Smart Metering

UK energy suppliers are mandated to deliver the Government's Smart
Metering Programme which requires all reasonable steps to be taken to
deploy smart electricity and gas meters to the equipment of 100% of
residential and small business customers by the end of 2020.

The programme will require EDF Energy’s supply business to install an
estimated 5.5 million meters, including communications hubs and in-
home displays, to all of its domestic and small business customers. Around
1.5 million smart meters are planned to be installed annually, a four-fold
increase on the current planned volume of expired meter renewals each
year. This is the biggest programme in the Customers business over the next
few years. EDF Energy aims to deliver its obligation more effectively than its
competitors, and to maximize the enduring benefit in order to transform the
customer relationship. It has already commenced smart meter installations
and is piloting operations using the first generation of compliant smart
meters. This is ahead of a steady ramp up in volume and the years of mass
roll-out which are from 2017 onwards.

B2C Customer Services

The B2C segment had an excellent year in 2015 with the improvement of
the quality of its services, including the decrease of number of complaints,
the rising level of recommendation by customers, its quality assurance
and maintenance of control of its back office. During 2015 our Advisor
Recommendation Score (derived from a post-call customer survey) has been
increasing steadily and is now +53. Out of 19 suppliers, we have moved
to second in the Citizens’ Advice Complaints League Table. The Telephony
Average Speed of Answer is currently 2 mn 9 s for the year with 52% of
calls being answered within 60 seconds. Self-serve continues to improve
with 64.2% of all transactions being self-serve in 2015.

B2B

In 2015 B2B retained its leadership position in volume, supplying a total of
35.0TWh of electricity; 1.8TWh to 182,382 Small and Medium Enterprise
(SME) accounts and 33.2TWh to 113,409 Industrial and Commercial (I&C)
accounts, reflecting an overall B2B market share of 19.3%. The business
continues to be well established in the large, national and multi-site customer
segments, and it successfully retained large customers such as Nestle and
Nissan, and acquired Airbus as a new customer.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Competition across all sectors remains fierce. This is demonstrated by the
continued erosion of the combined market shares of large suppliers by smaller
entrants and the increasing influence of third party intermediaries. This
resulted in pressure on pure energy supply margins for business contracts.
In addition, the UK government announced the removal of the exemption
from the Climate Change Levy for renewable electricity from 1 August 2015.
This will have significant implication on 1&C margins for 2016 although is
expected to deliver a more rational market for future years.

Optimisation and risk management activities

General principles

The policies surrounding EDF Energy's energy purchasing and risk
management activities are carried out in accordance with EDF group’s
policies and ensure that EDF Energy's activities are optimised and its services
delivered at a competitive price while limiting its gross margin volatility.

The Optimisation division's purpose is to manage the wholesale market
risk of EDF Energy in one place within pre-defined risk limits and control
framework. It provides a unique interface with the wholesale markets, via
EDF Trading. Optimisation also provides modelling services to the whole of
EDF Energy, as well as negotiating and managing asset backed commercial
structures with third parties e.g. NDA and Centrica.

Electi

ity sales and procurement

The power generated by the generation fleet is sold via the Optimisation
division within EDF Energy's customers business. Since April 2010, 20% of
the output from nuclear generation is separately sold to Centrica under the
agreements made at the time of the Centrica transactions. The remaining
80% is sold to Optimisation under the same transfer price as used for the
transaction with Centrica, based on published market prices, smoothed
over forward electricity prices where liquidity allows.

Over and above its own generation, EDF Energy also sources electricity
through export power supplied from power purchase agreements which are
mainly with renewable and CHP generators. In 2015, EDF Energy acquired
approximately 6.5TWh through this channel.

For delivery in 2015, EDF Energy’s net position on the wholesale market was
asale of approximately 24.3TWh (including structured trades). In 2015, EDF
Energy sold approximately 83.3TWh and bought 59.0TWh.

Gas, coal and carbon rights procurement

Coal and gas contracts (physical and financial) and CO, emissions rights are
entered into by EDF Energy to hedge the requirements of its power plants.
and gas consumers.

Purchases are based on coal and gas asset generation forecasts and target
coal stock levels. In 2015, 49% of EDF Energy's coal deliveries were from
international suppliers and sourced through EDF Trading.

1.4.5.1.2.5 Nuclear New Build business

Nuclear New Build (NNB) activity

EDF aims to build up to four new EPR nuclear reactors in the UK: twin
reactors at Hinkley Point and further twin reactors at Sizewell. The plans
are conditional on the necessary consents being received and a robust
investment framework being in place.

EDF | 2015 Reference Document 57

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

The EPR technology is already being deployed at the new nuclear power
station being constructed by EDF at Flamanville in France (see section 1.4.1.2
“New Nuclear Projects”) and at Taishan in China. Using the same technology,
adapted for UK requirements, will enable the efficiencies that come with
standardisation of design in the construction and operation of a series of
plants to be realised.

EDF has also agreed Head of Terms with CGN (China General Nuclear Power
Corporation) for the development of a further new nuclear project in the
UK at Bradwell B in Essex.

Hinkley Point C (HPC)

Project update

The HPC project is well advanced. It has achieved planning consent, design
approval for the EPR reactor and a nuclear site licence has been granted.
There is a well-developed supply chain with identified preferred bidders
who are already heavily involved in construction planning. Training for skills
needed is underway and industrial agreements with trade unions are in place.

EDF will be the “responsible designer” for the HPC project, with a central
role in the design and engineering of the power station.

As announced on 21 October 2015, total construction costs to first operation
are forecast to be £18bn nominal. The construction costs have remained
stable in real terms since they were announced, in October 2013.

Final terms for contracts with a number of key suppliers for HPC have also
been agreed:

m AREVA NP (Nuclear steam supply system, instrumentation and control);
= Alstom France (turbines) and Alstom UK (services during operations);
= Bouygues TP/Laing O'Rourke (main civil works);

= BAM Nuttal/Kier Infrastructure (earthworks).

A number of selected contractors are being engaged on Early Contractor
Involvement (EC) activities, including inputting into the HPC engineering
and pre-construction planning teams to help de-risk the project and facilitate
delivery of the construction schedule. Procurement also continues on
other critical path contracts such as key installation and equipment supply
contracts for the main site.

The project team is continuing the pre-development site preparation
and enabling works to prepare the construction site ahead of the main
construction works that will follow when a final investment decision is
taken. These works include the construction of roundabouts and temporary
construction roads to give access to the site for machinery needed for the
main construction phase; remediation and enabling works for the earthworks,
water management works, and the construction of office buildings and
worker welfare facilities.

Contractual and commercial aspects have been carefully examined, especially
by independent experts. A detailed review of the risk conducted at the end of
2015 established that risks are clearly identified and can be overcome through
the implementation of a series of recommendations whose implementation
has already begun. Other risk analyzes will take place throughout the project,
which is a usual practice for projects of this magnitude.

First operation of HPC, initially scheduled in 2025, will depend on the date
of the Final Investment Decision.

EDF's current investment programme to safely extend the lives of its existing
power stations contributes to maintaining a secure supply of low-carbon
electricity for the UK prior to HPC coming on-line.

Land Deals

Land acquisition has mirrored the planning progress and reflects those sites
included in applications subject to the Planning Inspectorate process (PINS).

In 2012, the land required at the main site for the terrestrial construction
of HPC was secured with negotiations concluded with relevant parties to
allow three 999-year leases of the HPC main site to be put in place when
needed and one of these leases is now in place. The majority of the land
needed to assemble the associated development sites required to support the
construction process has now been secured. A number of these development
sites were secured through Option Agreements, therefore EDF does not yet
have possession of the land but has the right to acquire or lease it when
the land is required by the project.

Revenue Arrangements: Contract for Difference (CfD)

As announced on 21 October 2015, NNB (Nuclear New Built) and the
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) have agreed the full
‘terms of the CfD for HPC, which had already been approved by the European
Commission in October 2014 following a 12-month investigation.

The CfD will mean that from the plant's start date:

if the reference price at which the generator sells electricity on the market
is lower than the strike price set under the terms of the contract, the
generator will receive an additional payment and;

@ if the reference price is higher than the strike price, the generator will
be liable for the difference.

The key elements of the CfD are:

= the “strike price” for HPC is set at £,,,,92.50/MWh or £,,,,89.50/MWh
if the Sizewell C planned power station goes ahead. There will be a
payment from Sizewell C to HPC equivalent to £,,,.3/MWh upon a final
investment decision being taken with respect to Sizewell C reflecting
the fact that the first of kind costs of EPR reactors are shared across the
HPC and Sizewell C sites;

m the strike price is fully indexed to inflation through the Consumer Price
Index;

m the contract will last for 35 years;
@ the project will be protected from certain changes in law;

® if savings are achieved in the construction of the HPC project, these will
be shared with consumers through a lower strike price.

Financing

As announced on 21 October 2015, under the Strategic Investment
Agreement signed by EDF and CGN, EDF's share in HPC will be 66.5%
with CGN's share being 33.5%. Without reducing this initial stake below
50%, EDF intends to bring other investors into the project in due course.

The project will also benefit from the Government's Infrastructure Guarantee
Scheme. The availability of the initial £2bn of the scheme was announced by
the Chancellor in September 2015, subject to the conditions in accordance
with market practices. The project should be financed with equity from
each partner, at least in a first step. EDF will completely consolidate the
project on its accounts.

Funded Decommissioning Programme (FDP)

Operators of new nuclear power stations are required under the Energy
Act 2008 to have a FDP (Funding Decommissioning Programme) in place
and approved by the DECC before nuclear safety related construction


--- Page 48 ---

begins. The overall objective of the FDP is to ensure that operators make
prudent provision for:

® the full costs of decommissioning their installations;

= their full share of the costs of safely and securely managing and disposing
of their waste; and that in doing so the risk of recourse to public funds
is remote.

A preliminary version of the FDP was formally submitted in draft form to
DECC in March 2012. There have been a series of subsequent discussions
with DECC and their advisers, including the independent Nuclear Liabilities
Financing Assurance Board. NNB and DECC agreed the full terms of the
FDP in 2015 and the final version was approved by the Secretary of State
on 21 October 2015.

On 9 October 2015, the European Commission approved the pricing
methodology for the UK’s waste transfer contract scheme which will apply
to HPC as part of the FDP. This innovative scheme means that the full costs
of decommissioning and waste management associated with new nuclear
power stations are set aside during generation.

Final Investment Decision

A final investment decision on HPC will only be taken by the Group once
the following steps have been completed:

® finalisation of the long form equity documentation with CGN, based on
the Head of Terms agreed on 21 October 2015;

= approval by the boards of EDF and CGN.

The approvals from competition authorities under the control of
concentrations and other governmental authorities in China and Europe
were obtained in the first quarter 2016.

Sizewell C

As announced on 21 October 2015, EDF and CGN have signed a Head of
Terms for an agreement in principle to develop Sizewell C in Suffolk to a
final investment decision with a view to building and operating two EPRs at
the site. During the development phase, EDF will take an 80% share with
CGN taking a 20% share.

As part of the planning process, EDF's initial proposals for Sizewell C were
published in November 2012 and the first round of formal consultation
with local communities has already taken place. Work has continued to
prepare for the launch of the second formal stage of consultation with
local communities and stakeholders. This is expected in 2016, once a
final investment decision has been taken for HPC. Ground investigations,
‘transport and environmental studies have helped refine the project's transport
and accommodation strategies and the understanding of the engineering
requirements for the development. These studies are also being used to
support the nuclear site licence and environmental permits applications,
which are at an early stage of development.

Discussions will commence in 2016 on the majority of the permanent
and construction land. Work has begun to acquire the land that has been
identified for accommodation and for transport infrastructure.

In April 2015, 67 hectares of land was acquired close to Sizewell C, to
develop as wetland habitat to compensate for any potential land taken from
the local site of special scientific interest during the main construction of
the Sizewell project. Good progress was made on these works throughout
the rest of 2015.

Bradwell B

EDF and CGN have also signed a Heads of Terms for an agreement in
principle to seek the regulatory approval (via the Generic Design Assessment
process), from the UK nuclear safety regulator, for a UK version of the third
generation HPR1000 reactor called Hualong. The HPR1000 will be based
on CGN's Fangchenggang Plant Unit 3/4 in China, the reference plant

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

for the UK-adapted Hualong design. Under the terms of the agreement,
a joint venture company will undertake and manage the Generic Design
Assessment process.

CGN and EDF have signed a Heads of Terms for an agreement in principle
to develop Bradwell B in Essex to a final investment decision with a view
to building and operating the UK-adapted Hualong reactor technology
approved by the UK regulator through the Generic Design Assessment
process. During the development phase, CGN will take a 66.5% share and
EDF will take a 33.5% share.

The UK’s robust nuclear regulation ensures that all developers and operators
of reactors and nuclear plants must demonstrate that they meet strict
compliance requirements for safety and security.

1.4.5.1.2.6 Commitments under European Commission
Merger Regulation (ECMR)

EDF Energy has continued to comply in 2015 with the commitment to sell
minimum volumes of electricity on the UK wholesale market, ranging from 5
to 10TWh per year during the period from 2012 to 2015. This commitment
was agreed with the EC at the time of the acquisition of British Energy
under the ECMR. The delivery of these sales has now been completed
and verified by the Monitoring Trustee who has notified the European
Commission accordingly.

All other commitments agreed at the time of the purchase of British Energy
have now been met.

1.4.5.1.2.7 United Kingdom Legal Environment

Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)

In June 2014, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) commenced
its investigation into the “supply and acquisition of energy in Great Britain”.
The CMA is the UK’s economy-wide competition and consumer authority
with a primary duty “to promote competition for the benefit of consumers,
both within and outside the UK”.

In July 2015, the CMA published its Provisional Findings report, together
with a Notice of Possible Remedies. The Provisional Findings report listed
the features that the CMA had provisionally found as giving rise to adverse
effects on competition (AECs) in the electricity and gas markets. The
Notice of Possible Remedies set out possible actions that the CMA could
take to remedy, mitigate or prevent the AECs it had provisionally identified
(and the resulting detrimental effect on consumers). The CMA noted
9 AECs and identified 18 possible remedies in total. The possible remedies
largely focused on the retail and regulatory framework, and in particular
considered measures to improve customer engagement in the domestic
and microbusiness markets.

The CMA published two further updates to the Provisional findings report
and Notice of Possible Remedies:

™ on 26 October 2015, the CMA published a Supplemental Notice
of Possible Remedies which invited comments on a further possible
remedy to encourage customer engagement by prohibiting the use of
evergreen tariffs;

= on 16 December 2015, the CMA published an Addendum to provisional
findings. The CMA stated that upon further consideration, it has
provisionally found that a combination of features in the prepayment
segment of the domestic retail supply of gas and electricity gives rise
to an AEC. Alongside this document, the CMA published a Second
supplemental notice of possible remedies. This sets out four additional
possible remedies that the CMA may introduce to address the AEC it
has provisionally identified in the Addendum.

On 21 September 2015, the CMA announced an extension to its statutory
investigation deadline by six months from 25 December 2015 to 25 June

DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

2016. It stated that this was necessary to allow sufficient time to take full
and proper account of any comments received from stakeholders in response
to the provisional findings and to reach a fully reasoned final decision. The
CMA has announced its temporary decision about the corrective actions
on 17 March 2016, earlier than its final report of June 2016.

Electricity Market Reform (EMR)

The three most significant elements of EMR are the carbon price floor,
introduced under the Finance Act 2011, the Capacity Market and Contracts
for Difference, introduced under the Energy Act 2013.

The carbon price floor, which sets the price that fossil-fired generators pay
for their carbon emissions is an important driver of the profitability of low
carbon generation such as EDF Energy's nuclear and renewable plants.
The “carbon price support rate” that underpins the carbon price floor was
capped in the Budget 2014 on 19 March 2014 at £18/tonne of CO2 for
the four years, April 2016 to April 2020.

The Capacity Market is intended to ensure security of electricity supply. Annual
auctions are held to procure capacity four years ahead of delivery with a
subsequent auction one year ahead of delivery. The second capacity auction
for delivery of capacity from October 2019 took place in December 2015
resulting in capacity agreements for 46,354MW of de-rated capacity at a
price of £55:401518/KW. EDF Energy's eight nuclear power stations, West
Burton B CCGT plant and the open cycle gas turbines at West Burton A
secured capacity agreements in the December 2014 auction for the period
October 2018-September 2019 and in the December 2015 auction for
October 2019-September 2020. The four coal-fired units at Cottam and three
of the four coal-fired units at West Burton A secured capacity agreements
in the December 2014 auction for the three year period October 2018
— September 2021. Unit 3 at West Burton A failed to secure a capacity
agreement in both the December 2014 and December 2015 auctions.

Contracts for Difference are expected to support investment new low carbon
generation including in particular the Hinkley Point C project. Results of the
first Allocation Round (auction) for CfDs were announced in February 2015,
with contracts awarded to 27 renewable energy projects, most of which were
onshore or offshore windfarms. EDF Energy has subsequently acquired one
of the successful projects from this auction, Dorenell Wind Farm, a 177 MW.
onshore windfarm development, which was awarded a CfD with a strike
price of £,5,.82.50/MWh). The Government has said that it will hold up to
three further CfD auctions by 2020, the first of these to be in 2016, and
that these will support further development of offshore wind, conditional
on the achievement of cost reductions.

1.4.5.2. Italy

1.4.5.2.1 EDF group's strategy in Italy

The Italian energy market represents a strong strategic interest for EDF due
to the magnitude of its importance in both the European electricity and gas
markets, and its connection to the French markets.

Like the majority of European energy systems, the Italian market is currently
facing a certain number of challenges. Thanks to its current position and to
its integrated presence in the gas and electrical energy value chain, Edison
is well-placed to seize opportunities created by market changes, in order
to sustain its growth, all while pursuing efficiency and profitability, in line
with CAP 2030 priorities.

Edison could play an active role in the process of consolidation of the Italian
market, notably by benefiting from the streamlining of EDF's presence in
the country.

60 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

The main development factors are:

® in order to optimise its portfolio of electricity generation in Italy, Edison
aims to increase its production of renewable energy by the promotion
of specific investments in hydroelectricity and the development of new
renewable sources, in particular, by using new business models, while
focusing the thermal generation portfolio on the most efficient assets;

® in relying on the strong positioning of its brand, Edison is well placed
to grow its portfolio of individual gas and electricity customers, and
to improve the value of its offering with added-value energy services;

@ in the area of gas, beyond the optimisation of the current portfolio,
Edison can contribute to the development of Italy as a gas hub, in order
to reinforce its competitiveness and that of the EDF group, and the
flexibility and security of supplies;

min the area of E&P (Exploration & Production), Edison intends to modulate
its activity, by pursuing a selective development of Italian E&P activities, in
integration with the gas and electricity value chain, all while optimising
international projects.

1.4.5.2.2 The EDF group's activities in Italy

As of the end of 2015, the Group was mainly present in Italy through its
97.405% shareholding in Edison, which is a major player in the Italian
electricity and gas markets and a well-known Italian brand.

The EDF group is also present in Italy through subsidiaries and the following

shareholdings:

m EDF Fenice, 100%-owned and specialised in environmental services and
energy efficiency (see section 1.4.6.1.2 “EDF Fenice”);

= EDF Energies Nouvelles, which has one subsidiary located in Italy.

In Italy and abroad, the Group‘s gas output activities through Edison were
down compared to 2014, reaching 1.99Gm:? (-7.3% against the figure
for 2014).

Oil and condensate output rose in 2015, with 4.35 million barrels produced
(+4.6% compared with 2014), of which 2.5 million were produced in Italy.

1.4.5.2.3 Edison's act

1.4.5.2.3.1 Electricity generation business

At 31 December 2015, the Edison's installed generation capacity in Italy was
7,158GW, with net electricity output of 18.5TWh over the year, representing
an increase compared with 2014. This increase was mainly due to increased
thermoelectric and wind-powered generation, as a result of the demand for
electricity in Italy and arbitrage transactions carried out between proprietary
production and market purchases. Edison’s generation fleet is currently
made up of 48 hydropower plants, 19 thermal power plants, 35 wind
farms, 9 photovoltaic power plants and 1 biomass plant. Combined-Cycle
Gas Turbines (CCGT) account for 76.4% of electricity generation, while
hydropower accounts for 18.3% and combined wind and solar for 5.3%.

Edison operates approximately 1,427MW of hydropower facilities with an
output of 3.38TWh (-32% compared with the exceptional production of
2014).

In December 2015, Edison reached an agreement to sell its equity interests in
Hydros (40%) and in Sel Edison (42%), the two hydropower joint ventures,
with the Alperia company in the Bolzano province, in exchange for 100%
of Alperia’s hydropower facilities situated on the Cellina River. Because of
this transaction, Edison, which would have had to deconsolidate the two
equity interests starting from 2016, will entirely consolidate the business,
including the Cellina facilities, increasing its installed capacity by 9OMW,
while reducing the risk connected to the renewal of the concessions in its
hydropower portfolio.

In the area of renewable energies, Edison also maintains a critical size, thanks
to E2i Energie Speciali srl (E2i), a company created in 2014 in partnership with
the F2i fund, which holds 70% of the share capital, the 30% remaining being
held by a holding company between Edison and EDF Energies Nouvelles.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES

17.6Gm? (13.2Gm? in 2014). Edison imported 12.7Gm? in 2015, i.e. 21%
of total Italian gas import, which represents 91% of national demand.

E2i holds 594MW of renewable assets (contributed 82% by Edison and
18% by EDF EN Italia) and transfers 100% of the energy generated to
Edison, which utilises it to the benefit of an integrated management of its
production portfolio.

A company headed by EDF EN and dedicated to services was also set up
for the operation and maintenance of this platform.

Moreover, outside of Edison and the partnership with F2i, EDF EN is present
in Italy (see section 1.4.1.4.3 “EDF Energies Nouvelles”).

Internationally-speaking, Edison benefits from a well-established presence
in Greece, where it is one of the main electricity operators of the country,
through ElpEdison SA, with a 38% equity interest with Hellenic Petroleum,
Hellenic Energy and Development (the Hellactor group) and Halcor. ElpEdison
owns two CCGT plants: one in Thessaloniki (389MW) and another in Thisvi
(410MW), built by Edison.

Finally, in Brazil, Ibiritermo, a 50%-owned subsidiary of Edison, operates a
226MW CCGT power plant.

1.4.5.2.3.2 Hydrocarbon business

For the implementation of its gas strategy, the EDF group, through Edison,
benefits from experience developed along the entire value chain, from
exploration-production through to the direct sale of natural gas.

Edison‘s gas supply portfolio is mainly based on long-term contracts and, in
2015, it included approximately 12.7Gm# of imports via gas pipelines and
LNG, with 0.49Gm? of own production in Italy and 4.2Gm? purchased on
the market. Changes in inventory and network losses represent 0.20Gm?.

In 2015, in Italy, Edison delivered 3.4Gm? of gas to the industrial sector,
2.6Gm# to the residential sector, 5.7Gm? to the thermoelectric sector
(including Edison’s own internal needs), and 5.9Gm;? to the wholesale market.

Due to the difficult gas market situation, since 2010, Edison, like all other
players in the sector, has asked suppliers to adjust their contractual terms,
by reviewing long-term contracts in force.

The price-revision arbitrational proceedings were concluded on 27 November
2015, with the arbitral award rendered by the International Court of
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in favour of Edison.
It involved the dispute between Edison and ENI on the price revision of a
long-term Libyan gas contract. Thus, Edison obtained a lowering of the gas
price, effective retroactively.

60 concessions and exploration permits in Italy and 66 abroad, and
approximately 42 billion cubic metre equivalents in reserves. Abroad, Edison’s
most significant asset is the Abu Qir gas field in Egypt; in early 2009 Edison
purchased the exploration, production and development rights for this field
for an initial period of 20 years, extendable by a further 10 years.

In 2015, Edison enriched its hydrocarbons development portfolio with the
acquisition of Apache Beryl | (a subsidiary of Apache Corporation) and its
interest in the share capital of the Scott and Telford deposits (10.5% and
15.7%, respectively), situated in the North Sea. This acquisition contributed
to an increase of approximately 1.1 billion cubic metres equivalent (85%
petroleum and 15% gas) in the Group’s reserves.

Finally, Edison is pursuing its exploration activities in Italy and abroad,
particularly in the United Kingdom and in Norway, and currently holds
licenses in the North Sea, in the Norwegian Sea and in the Barents Sea.

Gas infrastructures

Edison holds an equity interest of 7.3% in the Adriatic LNG Terminal company,
which manages the offshore regasification terminal of Rovigo (8Gm? per
year). This terminal is powered with Qatari gas. The other shareholders are
ExxonMobil Italiana Gas (70.7%) and Qatar Terminal Company Limited
(22%). Edison, according to the contract terms signed with Ras Laffan
Liquefied Natural Gas Company Limited II (RasGas Il), owns 80% of the
terminal's capacity, or 6.4Gm? per year.

Edison is involved in various gas import infrastructure projects (see
section 1.4.6.2.2.2 “Infrastructure”), such as IG! Poseidon, 50%-owned
by Edison, a company involved in the development of several projects that
aim to connect Greece and Italy (IGI), Greece and Bulgaria (IGB, in 50/50
partnership with Bulgaria), as well as Greece and Cyprus (EastMed).

1.4.5.2.3.3 Sales and supply activities

In 2015, Edison sold 89.4TWh of electricity in Italy (compared with 95.5TWh
in 2014, i.e. -6.4% compared with 2014), of which 18.5TWh were generated
and 70.9TWh were purchased on the markets. Sales to end-customers
amounted to 17.1TWh, down by 16.2% compared with 2014. At year-end
2015, Edison was serving 591,993 electricity customers and 521,399 gas
customers, both in the business and residential segments.

In sales and marketing, Edison continues to grow its electricity and gas sales
to individuals and to the SME segment, aiming for excellence in customer
relationships and focusing on selected loyal customers. In parallel, Edison
intends to maintain its position as a leader in the business-customer market,
by developing an advisory approach in energy.

The Group will grow its presence in the region by reinforcing the cooperation
between Edison and Fenice, in order to develop energy service offers for
its customers.

1.4.5.2.3.4 Regulated activities

Gas transport and storage

Edison owns 100% of the Edison Stoccaggio company, dedicated to
regulated gas-storage activities.

Edison also operates two storage sites in depleted reservoirs (fields which
have been depleted of natural gas): Cellino (since 1984) and Collalto (since
1994), with a total volume of 700Mm?.

Moreover, Edison has been operating a third site, since 2013, San Potito
& Cotignola, and is developing a storage project on the Palazzo Moroni site.

Finally, Infrastrutture Trasporto Gas SpA (ITG), wholly owned by Edison, owns
and directly manages the Cavarzere-Minerbio gas pipeline, a functional link
from the Rovigo terminal to the national network, with a transport capacity
of over 9Gm? per year.

Distribution

Gas distribution in Italy is regulated and supervised by AEEG, the electricity
and gas authority that establishes, in particular, quality and safety parameters,
as well as network access rules.

Infrastrutture Distribuzione Gas spa (previously called Edison Distribuzione
Gas) is the company dedicated to the distribution of natural gas within the
Edison group. In 2015, Edison DG distributed 257Mm? of natural gas to
150,368 users in northern and central Italy.

1.4.5.2.4 EDF Fenice

EDF Fenice, which is wholly-owned by the EDF group, is based in Turin,
and benefits from an international presence, with subsidiaries in Spain,
Poland, and Russia. Its principal activities, intended for industrial clients,
consist of the development of solutions in the energy efficiency domain
(see section 1.4.6.1.2 “EDF Fenice”).

1.4.5.2.5 EDF Energies Nouvelles

Following the adoption of the new regulatory framework for renewable
energy in Italy, EDF Energies Nouvelles did not commission any additional
capacity in 2015 in Italy. Thus, the capacities held by EDF EN Italia at
31 December 2015 totalled 440.4MW gross wind power (or 246.6MW net
power) and 79.5MW gross photovoltaic power (or 76.8MW net power) (see
section 1.4.1.4.3 “EDF Energies Nouvelles”).

1.4.5.3.1 Northern Europe

Belgium

The Benelux region features important interfaces with the Franco-German
electricity marketplace and projects for new links with Germany and with
Great Britain are also being examined. Benelux also constitutes an important
link in the European gas market because of its numerous import and transit
structures, such as the Zeebrugge hub and the Dunkirk LNG terminal nearby.

The EDF group is present in Belgium through its two subsidiaries, EDF
Belgium and EDF Luminus.

EDF Belgium

As part of a long-term nuclear energy cooperation agreement with Electrabel,
EDF holds 50% in undivided co-ownership of the Tihange 1 nuclear power
plant, through its wholly owned Belgian subsidiary, EDF Belgium. The capacity
attributed to EDF represents 481MW (or 2% of total Belgian generation
capacity). Tihange 1 output, which is attributed to EDF Belgium is sold to
EDF Luminus through a long-term contract which was renewed in late 2015
for 10 additional years.

Belgium's 2003 nuclear phase-out legislation originally provided for the
closure of Tihange 1 on 1 October 2015. Nevertheless, it was finally decided
to extend its operation upon 2025, following the adoption in 2012 by the
Belgian government of the Equipment Plan, and the Law of 2013 amending
the Law of 2003 pertaining to the timeframe for the phasing out of nuclear
energy. This extension was the subject of an agreement concluded on
12 March 2014 between Electrabel, EDF and the Belgian State, defining
its terms and conditions.

The extension of the life span of Tihange 1 requires significant investment,
with EDF's share amounting to €300 million, spread over the period from
2011 to 2020.

EDF Luminus

At the end of 2015, the EDF group held 68.63% of the EDF Luminus
company through its subsidiary EDF Belgium, with the remaining equity
held by Belgian public shareholders (see below).

EDF Luminus is the second largest player in the Belgian energy market,
holding a balanced upstream/downstream portfolio. The business accounts
for nearly 10% of the country’s output capacity, with an installed capacity
of 1,955MW at end-2015. The electricity output of EDF Luminus reached
4,141GWh in 2015. The company employs 1,583 persons.

EDF Luminus worked to realise its strategic ambition, by reducing its costs
while optimising its thermal production fleet, pursuing the development of
wind farms, and launching the development of energy services.

Acquisition of ATS, a leading player in energy services
for industrial clients

On 27 May 2015, EDF Luminus finalised the acquisition of a majority
shareholding in ATS SA following the favourable opinion of the Belgian
Competition Authority. In addition to the distribution of electrical equipment,
ATS offers complete integrated solutions in electricity and heating: design
and engineering, installation and maintenance of industrial electricity grids,
automation, industrial cooling, fire detection, and hydraulics.

EDF Luminus and ATS can better assist their industrial clients and those from
the tertiary and public sectors, thanks to an offer which has been enriched
with energy-efficiency solutions and solutions to optimise their consumption.

New agreement on EDF Luminus shareholder agreement

On 26 October 2015, the shareholders of EDF Luminus, Publilec, Socofe,
Ethias, Nethys and the EDF group signed an amendment to the EDF Luminus

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

shareholders’ agreement, which extended the latter agreement up to 2025,
and provides for the following reorganisation of the shareholding:

= the maintenance of four Belgian shareholders: Publilec (26.4%), Socofe
(4.7%), Ethias (0.2%) and Nethys (0.1%) who, under the shareholders’
agreement, benefit from a liquidity mechanism which makes it possible
for them to withdraw from the share capital of EDF Luminus starting
from the end of 2018;

™ the acquisition by the EDF group of the equity interest of Publilum and
VEH in EDF Luminus, representing in total 6.33%, which brings the
equity interest of EDF in EDF Luminus up to 68.63% (instead of 62.3%
as previously).

Consequently, the Board of Directors of EDF Luminus, which met on
26 October 2015, decided to cancel the planned initial public offering
of EDF Luminus, initiated in May 2015. This change in the EDF Luminus
shareholding made it possible for the Company to retain its local presence,
thanks to an amendment of the agreement between EDF and its Belgian
co-shareholders.

EDF Luminus owns 10.2% (419MW) of Belgium's Tihange 2 and 3 nuclear
power plants (commissioned in 1983 and 1985 respectively) and the Doel 3
and 4 plants (commissioned in 1982 and 1985 respectively), which have
a life span of 40 years. EDF Luminus also has 100MW drawing rights on
the French Chooz B nuclear power plant, based on a band of guaranteed
output according to the average availability of the French fleet.

The Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear reactors, which represent approximately
20% of energy demand in Belgium, were shut down from 2012 to 2014,
except for a brief period of relaunching between May 2013 and March 2014,
following the detection of micro-cracks. On 17 November 2015, the Federal
Agency for Nuclear Control authorised the return to production of these
two reactors, following receipt of the final report of the US laboratory, Oak
Ridge. Electrabel started the reactors back up at the end of December 2015.

Within the overall framework of the agreement concluded on 30 November
2015 between the Belgian State and Electrabel for the extension of the two.
Doel 1 and Doel 2 plants, an agreement was reached concerning the nuclear
tax in Belgium for the years 2015 (200 million) and 2016 (130 million).
The financial impact for the two Belgian subsidiaries of the EDF group was
€34.2 million in 2015 and €13.2 million in 2016. A variable formula will
apply from 2017 to 2019, with a minimum annual total of €150 million for
the nuclear tax in Belgium.

Apart from the drawing rights in the nuclear fleet, EDF Luminus has a
generation fleet consisting of power plants fired by natural gas, wind farms,
and a few “run-of-river” hydropower plants.

EDF Luminus also operates four combined-cycle power plants in Angleur,
Ringvaart, Seraing and Ham. In the latter, recoverable heat from the steam
turbine is used for the district heating network in the town of Gand. In
summer 2014, the Seraing power station was selected for Belgium's strategic
reserve for a period of three years. In addition, the Angleur and Izegem
power plants were also recently selected for Belgium's strategic reserve for
the winters of 2015-2016. The Monsin power plant was definitively closed.

EDF Luminus is active in the renewable energy sector with 7 hydropower
plants and 29 onshore wind farms, totalling 114 turbines spread across
Wallonia and Flanders. As of 31 December 2015, the company became
the leader in onshore wind-farming in Belgium, with an installed capacity
de 254MW. In 2015, EDF Luminus built 16 wind turbines with a combined
capacity of 42MW, and acquired a portfolio of 28MW of existing built
capacity (13 wind turbines).

Sales and marketing

Under its “Luminus” brand, EDF Luminus supplies electricity and gas to more
than 1.8 million residential and business customers (in delivery points) in
Belgium, with a net gain of 85,000 customers in B2C (business-to-customer)
in 2015. This excellent marketing achievement was awarded the top rating
of “5” given by the Flemish regulator, VREG, for eight consecutive quarters.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

EDF Luminus has pursued its strategy in pricing and services in order to
better address customer expectations, and to affirm its price positioning
in relation to its competitors, and has kept a stable market share of about
20%, in difficult market conditions marked by a relatively high attrition level.

Energy services

EDF Luminus has an expanded service offering, thanks to the recent
acquisitions of three significant complementary energy service providers
(Rami Services, Dauvister and ATS). The services offered to residential
customers are, inter alia, installation and maintenance of boilers, sale and
management of an intelligent thermostat (Netatmo), and comfort services
in the event of unforeseen damages to housing during inclement weather.
At the end of 2015, the B2C portfolio for these last three services exceeded
125,000 contracts. With close to 68,000 services sold during the course of
the 2015 year, sales more than tripled in comparison to 2014. And thanks to
cooperation with ATS, EDF Luminus can offer complete integrated electricity
and heating solutions to industrial clients.

Moreover, EDF Luminus is exploiting new, innovative niches for the
development of service activities. For example, with regard to electric
mobility, EDF Luminus is investigating different business models which make
it possible to offer its customers electric mobility services. Four rapid charging
stations were installed on a Campus site in Hasselt. A special feature of these
stations: they integrate a software which makes it possible to maximise the
use of local photovoltaic generation during the recharge.

The Netherlands

Through a joint venture, Sloe Centrale BV, EDF and Delta (each holding 50%)
own an 870MW CCGT power plant in the southwest Netherlands, whose
two 435MW units were commissioned in 2009 and serviced in mid-2013.
Thanks to its very high technical performance, the Sloe plant was called upon
to operate in 2015 for close to 3,500 hours, a significant period of time,
under conditions which were not very favourable to gas-powered plants.

Switzerland

The EDF group is present in Switzerland through its investments in Alpiq
Holding SA (25%) and in hydropower generation facilities in Le Chatelot
(50%), Emosson (50%) and Mauvoisin (10%).

Alpiq is a player of significant size in the European energy market, at the
heart of European electricity exchanges, active in the generation, sale, and
trading of energy as well as in energy services. Alpiq accounts for over one
third of the electricity supplied throughout Switzerland.

On the basis of its 2015 sales (CHF6,715 million), Alpiq is top-ranked among
Swiss electricity companies. The financial and non-financial transactions
of energy trading, carried out with third parties and with other associated
and connected businesses, accounted for respectively 11.4TWh and 89TWh
(mainly in wholesale markets and with major European clients from Southern,
Central, and Eastern Europe). Alpiq also provides services to around 100,000
customers in north-west Switzerland. This activity is supported by significant
generation assets in Switzerland and in other countries where Alpiq is
developing its presence.

Alpiq's activities rest primarily upon generation assets, which strongly exposes
it to variations in market price. In order to address the new marketing
environment, which has been strongly degrading since 2011, the Alpiq
group launched a plan for significant cost reduction as well as in-depth
strategic thinking, in order to best enhance the value of its assets and to
seize market opportunities, particularly in the energy services sector. In an
initiative to become debt-free and to streamline its portfolio, several equity
interests, including hydropower, had already been disposed of, and other
divestitures are still expected.

64 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

Austria

EDF had held up till now 25% of the Energie Steiermark AG (Estag) holding
company, alongside Land of Styria. Within the framework of its strategic
orientations, the EDF group initiated, at the end of 2014, a process for
the disposal of that minority equity interest, which was completed on
21 December 2015 by the buyback of EDF shares by Macquarie Infrastructure
and Real Assets, an investment fund specialised in infrastructures.

1.4.5.3.2 Central and Eastern Europe

Poland

The Group operates in Poland mainly through its EDF Polska SA subsidiary,
which includes the following:

m the Krakow cogeneration plant, which has an installed capacity of
460MWe and 957MWth;

m the Wybrzeze cogeneration plant, comprising the Gdansk and Gdynia
units with a total installed capacity of 333 MWe and 1,134MWth;

m_ the Rybnik generation plant, with an installed capacity of 1,775MWe;

m= the Warsaw plant, comprising the company headquarters and the

m the EDF Torun company, a subsidiary of EDF Polska, which owns the
municipal district heating distribution network in the town of Torun, in
addition to a coal-fired heat generation facility with an installed capacity
of 398MWth and 2MWe, which powers the network. The replacement
of the existing facility with a cogeneration facility equipped with two gas
turbines and gas-fired boilers with a total capacity of 101MWe should
take place from the winter of 2017-2018;

= the EDF Paliwa Sp. z 0. o company, also a subsidiary of EDF Polska,
responsible for the supply of coal and biomass for all of the EDF group
sites in Poland.

The Group also controls ZEW Kogeneracja SA, the cogeneration company
in Wroclaw. It has an installed capacity of 366MWe and 1,094MWth and
owns 98.4% of the electricity and heat generation company EC Zielona
Gora SA, powered entirely by a local gas source, the installed capacity of
which is 183MWe and 302MWth.

In the field of environmental protection, the Group decided to implement an
investment plan, particularly concerning the construction of desulphurisation
and denitrification facilities for its assets in Poland, inaugurated on
19 November 2013 in Wroclaw. It will enable the operation of the existing
generation plants to continue until 2035 at least.

Moreover, the Group is present in Poland through its subsidiary, EDF Energies
Nouvelles, which owns two wind farms, of 48MW in Linowo and 58MW.
in Rzepin. Other wind power projects are also under development (see
section 1.4.1.4.3 “EDF Energies Nouvelles”).

In October 2015, DK Energy Polska, a subsidiary of Dalkia SA in Poland,
acquired 100% of the shares of the Zaklady Energetyki CiepInej Katowice SA
(ZEC), a company which is mainly specialised in generation and distribution
of heat in the region of Katowice (Upper Silesia) and a leader in the area
of mine gas recycling. This acquisition was intended to serve as a base for
the development in the Polish market of the Dalkia offer in energy services
for industrial businesses and local communitites (heating networks and
energy-efficiency) and to develop the use of mine gas as a substitute for coal

In the framework of the CAP 2030 programme, a strategic review of the
Group's thermal assets in Poland is currently underway.

Hungary

BE Zrt

On 30 June 2015, the Group has concluded an agreement for the sale
of its shares (95.6%) in BE Zrt to EP Energy. After meeting the conditions
precedent, in particular, the review by the competent Hungarian authorities,
the transaction was finalised on 10 December 2015.

EDF Démasz Zrt

EDF Démasz Zrt is wholly owned by EDF and is mainly engaged in the
distribution and sale of electricity.

With regard to its supply activity, EDF Démasz Zrt supplies electricity to
individuals, small businesses and public institutions in the south-eastern
region of Hungary under the universal service concept (as defined by the
Hungarian government Decree pursuant to the Hungarian Electricity Act of
2007). Since 2009, the company has supplied electricity and, more recently,
gas, throughout Hungary to customers who opted for the open market.
In 2015, EDF Démasz Zrt sold 3,040GWh to around 740,000 customers,
including 1,440GWh on the open market.

Regarding its distribution business, the EDF Démasz Halézati Eloszt6 Kft
company, a wholly owned subsidiary of EDF Démasz Zrt, has been operating
since 2007 in response to the legal requirement that network activities
should be separated from generation/supply activities. It owns the electricity
network assets (about 32,200 kilometres of high-, medium- and low-voltage
lines) and operates the regulated electricity distribution business in Hungary's
south-eastern region (19.6% of the territory). In 2015, it distributed 4.3TWh
to 775,754 delivery points.

In 2014, faced with a depressed economic environment following the
introduction of particularly punishing pricing and tax measures (a network
tax of €0.45/m in 2013, and 25% price cuts imposed by the legislator
between 2013 and 2014), the company implemented cost cutting measures.

The government announced its intention to progressively take back control
of the utilities of the energy sector which had been privatised in the 1990s,
and to create a sector under the control of the State. In 2015, the ENKSZ
company was created to such end.

1.4.5.3.5.1 Brazil

Since April 2014, the Group has held 100% of EDF Norte Fluminense,
following the buyback of the 10% equity interest held by Petrobras in
the share capital of EDF Norte Fluminense. The company, which built and
operates since end of 2004 the Combined-Cycle Gas power plant of Norte
Fluminense, with an installed capacity of 827MW, situated in the region of
Macaé, sells 725MWh annually to the Light distribution company (pursuant
to the terms of a 20-year PPA), corresponding to about 6.3TWh per year.
The remaining balance is sold on the open electricity market. EDF Norte
Fluminense sold 260GWh in 2015.

EDF Norte Fluminense has an additional solar power plant, intended for
industrial consumption, comprising 1,764 photovoltaic modules which
generated 428MWh in 2015, helping to reduce its CO, emissions by around
250 tonnes a year.

In addition, on 11 December 2014, through its subsidiary EDF Norte
Fluminense, EDF acquired a 51% stake in Compagnie Energétique de Sinop
(CES), which is responsible for the construction and future operation of
Sinop’s hydropower facilities of an installed capacity of 4OOMW. The two.
other shareholders are Eletronorte (24.5%) and CHESF (24.5%), subsidiaries
of the Eletrobras group. Construction of the dam began in spring 2014
and commissioning for commercial operations is scheduled for the first
half of 2018. With a 51% stake in the consortium, the EDF group has an
industrial role in both the construction and the future operation of the dam.
At year-end 2015, close to 50% of the civil-engineering work had been
carried out on the project.

It should be noted as well that EDF Energies Nouvelles has launched its
operations in Brazil in February 2015, with the acquisition of 80% of the
portfolio of Ventos da Bahia. The first electricity supply contract represented
66MW in wind projects situated in the State of Bahia, in partnership with
Sowitec, a German group specialised in the wind energy development in
the world. In November 2015, EDF Energies Nouvelles won a second long-
term 117MW electricity-supply contract, in the same portfolio of wind
projects. The construction of these new capacities will begin in 2017, with
commissioning expected at the end of 2018.

1.4.5.3.5.2 Chile

In 2013, EDF entered a Joint Development Agreement with the Chilean
BBG project-development company and the U.S. company Cheniere, with
the aim of developing a gas-to-power project, combining construction,
operation andmaintenance of a CCGT electric power plant of approximately
600MW Installed capacity, with infrastructure for offshore LNG storage and
regasification of the FSRU (Floating, Storage & Regasification Unit) type.

In 2014, EDF created a subsidiary, EDF Chile, responsible for the development
of this project and to anchor EDF's presence on the Chilean energy market.

In 2015, EDF signed a new agreement (Restated and Amended Joint
Development Agreement) with the Chilean development company Biobio
Genera (formerly, Australis Power), for the pursuit of the development of
this project. In parallel, EDF and its partners are negotiating the financing
of this project with commercial banks, on the basis of project financing
with limited recourse.

In September 2015, EDF also took a 25% stake in project company, in
charge of the development of the terminal of Penco-Lirquén, and signed
agreements with its partners Biobio Genera and the Cheniere group's Chilean
subsidiary, intented to define their respective roles, rights and obligations
in the future organisation to be set up upon the conclusion of the project
financing (expected in 2016).

The EDF Energies Nouvelles subsidiary is also present in Chile, with
construction of a 146MW solar project in progress (see section 1.4.1.4.3,
“EDF Energies Nouvelles”).

1.4.5.3.6 Asia-Paci

The EDF group's activities in the Asia-Pacific region are focused on China
and fast developing countries. The presence in the sectors of electricity
generation, networks and services constitutes an industrial challenge
for the Group. In nuclear power, in addition to the project to build and
Operate two EPR reactors in Taishan, China, new projects should provide
the Group with access to technological innovation and enable it to develop
its industrial expertise. EDF’s objective is, thus, to maintain its competitive
and technological advantages in the international arena focused on the
global nuclear programme, the equipping of emerging countries, and the
renewal of the French fleet.

1.4.5.3.6.1 Activities in China

The EDF group has been present in China for more than 30 years through its
advisory services in nuclear, thermal and hydropower technologies. Today it
is one of China's most significant foreign investors in power generation, with
investments in coal-fired thermal facilities that have a total installed capacity
of 6,260MW '. With the Taishan project Phase | (two 1,750MW reactors),
EDF also became an investor in an electricity-generation project involving
an EPR nuclear power plant. Lastly, EDF is developing new partnerships,
which are opening it up to new investment perspectives in nuclear power,
gas power plants, hydropower, electricity distribution, and energy efficiency.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Ling Ao Phase | power plant (two 1,000MW reactors, commissioned in 2002
and 2003, respectively), and then Phase Il (two additional 1,000MW reactors.
commissioned in 2010 and 2011), EDF now provides operational support to
the CGN group and, in particular, to the Daya Bay Nuclear Operation and
Management Co. Ltd. The performance achieved by these power plants
since commissioning is one of the Group’s main benchmarks in China. In
addition, EDF owns a 30% shareholding in Taishan Nuclear Power Joint
Venture Company Ltd., which was set up to fund, build and operate two
EPR nuclear reactors in Taishan, in the province of Guangdong. The company
will have a 50-year life span, the maximum period currently authorised in
China for a nuclear power joint venture. Through this transaction, the Group.
represents the first foreign investor in Chinese nuclear power generation.
The project's success will rest on the complementary expertise of the EDF
and CGN groups. All of the equipment of Unit 1 has been installed, and the
majority of that of Unit 2 has been delivered. The beginning of all testing
for the commissioning of Unit 1 took place in December 2015.

Partnership agreements

The General Partnership Agreement between EDF and CGN was signed in
2007 and complemented in 2014 by implementation of agreements related
to engineering, R&D, and plant operation. The EDF group has set up a
facility based in Shenzhen, with the aim of promoting the EDF model of an
integrated architect-assembler operator while acting as a flagship for French
industry. Experts in this facility are working, in particular, to further promote
French codes and standards, as well as the Group's nuclear safety guidelines.

In 2010, the Group concluded a partnership framework agreement with
China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), extended in March 2014, aimed
at developing their cooperation along deeper, global lines. Also in 2013,
the Group signed an agreement with CGN and AREVA, which prepared
the terms for the construction of future reactors and provided for EDF's
contribution to CGN's operating fleet and its evolution.

The partnerships with CGN and CNNC have allowed discussions to take
place concerning their participation in the Hinkley Point C project: a protocol
to encourage industrial cooperation between EDF, CGN and CNNC in the
British nuclear market was signed in March 2014, and the agreement of
21 October 2015 between EDF and CGN complemented this partnership.
project (see section 1.4.5.1.2.5 “Nuclear New Build business”).

Lastly, in the context of the Franco-Chinese governmental declaration of
June 2015, tripartite agreements (EDF and AREVA with CGN and CNNC) were
signed over 2015, providing for the continuance of the EPR construction in
Taishan, the participation of the Chinese industrials in Great Britain, as well
as a partnership for the development of medium- and large-sized reactors.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Datang Sanmenxia Power Generation Company Ltd. (DSPC)

The EDF group holds 35% of DSPC, the company that owns the Sanmenxia 2
power plant in Henan province, commissioned in 2007, with an installed
capacity of 2x600MW, using a technology known as “supercritical coal”.
This investment was made through a joint venture with a fixed life span,
established by the Chinese authorities, running until 2039. The other
shareholders are two Chinese companies including Datang, the majority
shareholder in DSPC.

Fuzhou Power Generation Company (FPC)

The EDF group holds 49% of FPC, a joint-venture created in 2014 with a
subsidiary of the Datang group to build and operate an “ultra-supercritical”
coal-fired thermal power plant (2x1,000MW) in the Jiangxi province. The
first unit was commissioned on 29 December 2015, the second group being
expected in the spring of 2016. Fuzhou is thus the first power plant of the
“ultra-supercritical” type (in other words, having increased output and a
limited environmental impact) operated by the EDF group. This technology
allows to reach high levels of temperature and pressure in the boiler, assuring
a better output (close to 44% for Fuzhou) than a traditional power plant,
while decreasing coal consumption and CO, per kWh emission.

As a result of this cooperation, the Group has broad involvement in the
industrial process of building and operating the future power station. It will
thus be in a position to build on its thermal engineering and operational
skills and to establish new industrial synergies with global leaders in the
thermal power generation segment, such as Guangdong Engineering and
Design Institute (GEDI), the designer and builder of the power station, and
Dongfang, the supplier of the boilers and turbines.

Hydropower generation activities

Present in this segment since 1985, the EDF group is a well-known player.
The Group operated as consultant on several plants installed in China and
is looking at investment opportunities or service offers that will respond to
the needs on the Chinese side, where an ambitious hydropower programme
is under development.

Research & Development (R&D) activities

Four years after its creation, EDF's R&D centre in China is continuing to build
up its network of scientific partners in that country, together with the R&D
departments in France and the Group’s other international R&D centres (see
section 1.6.3 “International activity and partnerships”). The centre’s activities
involve the generation and storage of low-carbon electricity, tomorrow's
electricity networks, sustainable cities and innovation, with digital simulation
capacities being a strong component in each one of these fields.

Electricity distribution activities

Present in China since 2011, EDF International Networks has signed technical
support contracts in China concerning the planning and performance
improvement of the performance of distribution networks in the Shanxi and
Shaanxi provinces. EDF International Networks hopes to grow its business
in China so that it may apply its expertise, methods and most effective
tools to optimise network management and performance, particularly in
a context of cooperation with the two major players in China, State Grid
and Southern Grid.

Prospects for development and new projects

In energy services, the contract signed in 2013 with Dongfeng Peugeot
Citroén Automobile (DPCA) concerning energy efficiency for lighting, was
extended in 2014 and 2015.

68 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

The EDF group, Datang and the city of Sanmenxia signed a cooperation
agreement in 2015 to study a project for a district heating network from

features of each geographic region and thus to be present in high-growth
countries offering new markets. Also, it is pursuing its operations in regards
to decentralised production.


--- Page 58 ---

South Africa

The EDF group established a subsidiary in 2007 in Johannesburg, with a
view to preparing the relaunching of the South African nuclear programme.
The country’s energy master plan, promulgated in May 2011, anticipates
the commissioning of 9.6GW of nuclear power capacity between now
and 2030. The South African government plans to double the country’s
installed power generation capacity (from 44 to 89GW) by 2030, confirming
its commitment to the inclusion of nuclear power in its future energy
mix. Consequently, in 2014 and 2015, South Africa signed a number of
intergovernmental agreements with the various countries that have put
forward nuclear proposals. In that respect, delegations fromm these countries,
including France, were invited by the South African government to present
their expertise across the entire nuclear cycle. These steps are prerequisites
for the launch of a call for tenders.

In other segments, EDF Energies Nouvelles gained a foothold in the South
African wind power market in the second round of renewable energy tenders
launched in 2011 by the Ministry of Energy. The company was selected via
its subsidiary, Innowind (80% owned by EDF EN) to carry out three wind-
farm projects, the construction of which began at the end of 2013, and the
commissioning announced during 2015 (see section 1.4.1.4.3 “EDF Energies
Nouvelles”). Innowind was, moreover, selected for an additional 33MW.
of wind power, during the fourth round of the tenders by the Ministry of
Energy in June 2015.

EDF is also present in South Africa through the KES (Kukhanya Energy
Services) company, created in 2002 (see section 1.4.5.3.9 “Access to
Energy Mission”).

EDF is also exploring other fields, such as developing its technical and
strategic partnership with the South African electricity utility Eskom, for
the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. In this regard, a
technical partnership agreement was signed in November 2015 between
the Agence Francaise de Développement, Eskom and EDF, for the sharing
of technical expertise in the area of networks.

1.4.6.1 Energy services

The EDF group is a major player in energy services in France. Its competences
allow offering comprehensive solutions, covering various fields: advice,
solution design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the facilities

EDF is also active in sectors as varied as public lighting, heating networks,
decentralised low-carbon generation, remote control of consumption, and
electric mobility.

The Group’s strategic plan places an important emphasis on the development
of energy services, in order in particular to meet the needs of local
communities and businesses. This ambition rests upon a context which
advocates energy efficiency, decentralised generation with low-carbon
emissions, and research into competitiveness and quality of life, regardless
of what may be the business sector concerned.

Consequently, the Group’‘s actions are built around five challenges:

= energy efficiency for public buildings and tertiary and industrial
companies;

= providing support to regions during their project, and in particular to
“sustainable cities” or “smart cities”;

= local power generation and the associated heating and cooling networks;
® intelligent public lighting;
® electric mobility.

1.4.6.1.1 Dalkia

The EDF group has held a 99.94% equity interest since July 2014 in Dalkia,
a leading player in the European energy services market with a full range of
services and an excellent sales network in France, serving to reduce energy
consumption and to improve the performance of the facilities.

Dalkia’s operations

Dalkia now operates in the face of three major challenges: global warming
and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency as
a source of savings, and the territories transformation in an increasing
urbanisation context and the resulting industrial development.

Dalkia brings expertise to its customers, in order to develop, realise, and
manage innovative energy solutions, which are more ecological and more
economical, for sustainable growth of cities and businesses.

From decentralised generation to demand-side management, while
optimising distribution, Dalkia is present at each stage of the energy chain,
in order to improve system performance. Thanks to its nearly 80 years of
experience in managing heating and cooling networks, optimising industrial
utilities, improving the energy performance of a building, or using alternative
and renewable energies, Dalkia offers its customers tailor-made solutions
‘to reduce their energy consumption and to improve the environmental and
economic performance of their facilities.

In this way, Dalkia has allowed to avoid 2.46 million tonnes of CO, and
realised 3.91TWh of energy savings in 2015.

Heating and cooling networks

The development of the networks was an important growth engine in the
last few years for Dalkia which established a reproducible model for value
creation, resting upon numerous optimisation levers:

= improvement of the efficiency of teams and organisations, optimisation
of the performances of operations upon the takeover of networks;

= reconfiguration of generating plants and networks: anticipation of
future network needs, taking into account organic growth potential
and progression of energy efficiency, integration of the challenges of
regulatory compliance, reduction of unnecessary redundancies;

= modification of the energy mix for greater efficiency and less CO,, with
the optimisation of cogeneration and the development of renewable
energies (biomass, geothermal, etc.);

® additional services in order to better enhance assets (for example, support
service for the electricity grid).

Thus, Dalkia is one of the leaders in France in the management of urban
heating and air-conditioning networks, operating 358 heating or cooling
networks, both urban and local. Deploying this model across its geographic
targets will constitute a significant part of its future growth.

Industrial utilities

Dalkia is active in the industrial utilities business for 2,100 French industrial
sites. The challenge is to improve environmental performance (particularly
by controlling CO, emissions and the valuation of energy recovery),
competitiveness and security of supply.

Dalkia’s strategy is to allow its industrial clients to concentrate on their core
processes, by assuming responsibility for and optimising the production
of their utilities, their energy usage, and their greenhouse gas emissions.
Dalkia differentiates itself by a large and coherent range of services, which
includes the optimisation of industrial utilities (steam, electricity, compressed
air); adjustment of usage to requirements, and identification of sources of
unavoidable energy and recoverable co-products, optimisation of industrial
building usage, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Building energy services

Building energy services consist of management of the energy facilities in
buildings: optimisation of local thermal energy generation, energy supply,
operation and maintenance of technical facilities. They also seek to improve
the operation of existing systems in order to maximise their effectiveness and
to reduce their CO, emissions. Dalkia provides integrated energy services
ranging from the design, construction and upgrading of facilities, to energy
supply and management and maintenance of facilities, for tertiary, industrial,
public-sector and private-sector customers.

In this respect, Dalkia manages 88,000 energy facilities in France.

Key achievements for Dalkia in 2015

In October 2015, DK Energy Polska, a subsidiary of Dalkia in Poland,
completed the buyback of 100% of the shares of the Zaklady Energetyki
Cieplnej Katowice SA (ZEC) company, a company which is primarily specialised
in the generation and distribution of heat in the region of Katowice (Upper
Silesia), and of its subsidiary, EC Szopienice. The business's development
project, which rests primarily on gas mine recycling, and development of
heating networks, will allow to reduce carbon from the energy mix of the
region, while enhancing the value of local resources and by utilising more
effective processes.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Toulouse Métropole chose Dalkia for the construction of a new heating and

EDF Fenice, an international group based in Italy, was set up by the Fiat group
before being taken over (100%) by EDF in 2001. EDF Fenice is currently
active in Italy, Spain, Poland and Russia.

EDF Fenice operates in the field of industrial energy and environmental
efficiency. It designs, builds and manages either directly or on behalf of its
customers assets such as combined generation plants, electricity substations,
thermal power plants for industrial use or heating, cold generation power
plants, compressed air generation units, fluid distribution systems (electricity,
gas, hot or refrigerated air, compressed air, industrial gas and water) and
industrial water treatment plants. EDF Fenice develops efficiency projects in
the form of industrial partnerships or performance contracts with customers.
These are complemented by a wide range of energy and environmental
consulting services, waste treatment services, monitoring, analysis and
environmental rehabilitation. EDF Fenice supplements its services with
energy efficiency and environmental optimisation services for industrial
sites and facilities.

At 31 December 2015, EDF Fenice had a total electricity production capacity
of 280MW and a heat generation capacity of 2,789MWh. EDF Fenice has
52 thermal energy (steam, superheated water, hot water), electricity and
compressed air production sites.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Italy

Contracts with the Fiat group still account for over half of EDF Fenice’s
business. A major goal in 2015 was to strengthen the relationship with this
major customer by confirming the performance of the new contract and
the excellent service provided under the new contractual model established
in 2013. One of the benefits of this model is the development of efficient
partnership initiatives, increasing the likelihood that the contract will
automatically be renewed for a further five years in 2017.

In 2014, EDF Fenice built its Energy Management System according
to ISO Standard 50001-2011, which encourages best practices in
energy management (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other
environmental impacts, energy savings). In the end of December 2015,
13 of the 22 sites of the Fiat contract were certified (including both sites
located in Spain), with the objective of having them all certified in future.

Spain

EDF Fenice has operated in Spain since 2001 through its wholly owned
subsidiary EDF Fenice Instalaciones Iberica.

Strongly impacted by the energy reform of 2014, EDF Fenice Ibérica
demonstrated in 2015 its ability to surmount the crisis, thanks to the
consolidation of its commercial model in the services of energy efficiency
and the reinforcement of its position in the industry's market.

The implementation of the European Union Directive on Energy Efficiency
in Spain, setting concrete obligations for the large industrial businesses,
allowed EDF Fenice Ibérica to accelerate the development of the Global
Energy Partner model through reinforced commercial activity, targeted
operational marketing, and a strategy of commercial partnerships.

And so, in 2015, EDF Fenice Ibérica signed new contracts with significant
industrial groups from the Spanish agri-food sector, and established
partnership agreements with specialised companies, making it possible to
reinforce its commercial offering, both in the area of energy management
and in commodities management consulting.

Poland

EDF Fenice has a wholly owned Polish subsidiary, EDF Fenice Poland. This
company operates principally in the field of outsourced management of
industrial utilities (cogeneration, heating, cooling, compressed air, electricity
grid, industrial gases). It also handles various energy and associated
environmental services (potable water, waste treatment, and liquid effluents).
EDF Fenice also has the administrative concessions which are necessary to
supply customers connected to its distribution networks (electrical, gas,
heating). Finally, EDF Fenice Poland developed a business connected to
energy efficiency, with the objective of reducing its customers’ consumption
and environmental impacts.

Russia

EDF Fenice has a wholly owned subsidiary in Russia, Fenice Rus, which
markets energy efficiency and environmental services to industrial companies.
Since its creation, Fenice Rus has signed eight performance contracts with
Avtovaz, a Russia’s leading car maker, whichh are now fully operational. The
facilities built for the TMH (TransMashHolding) company are also operational
using the same business model. These projects have become a benchmark
for customers and public authorities. They have the advantage that they
can be replicated at other sites and in different business sectors.

In July 2015, and more recently, in early 2016, Fenice Rus also commissioned
the sewage treatment units which had been constructed, and which will be
operated for 10 years by Fenice Rus, on two of Danone’s industrial sites in
Russia. These projects have also become benchmarks and are the basis for
the international cooperation between Fenice and Danone.

72 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

An Energy Management System project has also been put into place in one
of the Schneider Electric plants in Russia. This contract, with a three-year
‘term, makes it possible to both identify energy-efficiency projects “online”
to be created on the site, and to provide a benchmark for this type of
project, on such a scale.

EDF Fenice is continuing to support international groups that operate in
Russia, such as Danone, Alstom and Renault Nissan.

1.4.6.1.3 Tiru

Tiru is 51% owned by the EDF group. It specialises in:

™ energy recovery: incineration of household waste to generate energy
(electricity and steam) for district heating or industrial applications;

™ organic recovery: breakdown of organic matter and production of
compost and biogas;

™ materials recovery: sorting and packaging of recyclable materials (plastic,
fibres, metals).

The remaining 49% is owned by Veolia Propreté (24%), CPCU (19%) and
GDF Suez Energie Services (6%).

Tiru designs, constructs and operates energy-from-waste and biomass
facilitites in France, Great Britain, and Canada, and has 1,096 employees.
Its client portfolio is made up of municipalities, predominantly departmental
and municipal consortia, waste management operators, as well as some
private-sector clients (in particular, greenhouse producers and industrials).

Tiru recovers 3 million tonnes of waste per year, through its 32 sites. Its
energy recovery units sold close to 2.63TWh of electricity and steam, 50%
of which was renewable energy. Thanks to Tiru, this supplied heating to
316,000 inhabitants and electricity to 514,000 inhabitants in 2015. In 2015,
Tiru saved the equivalent of 1.7 million barrels of oil, or 727,000 tonnes
of avoided CO, emissions.

Tiru is a pioneer in the waste market and thus contributes to the challenges
of energy transition. It industrialises new processes that are central to the
development of energy systems, such as the anaerobic digestion of household
waste and production of biogas, the production of solid recovered fuel, or
supply of hot water to agricultural greenhouses from the heat produced in
waste-to-energy plants.

In 2015, Tiru and the Henin-Beaumont Mixed Consortium for the Elimination
and Recovery of Waste (Symevad) launched a new and innovative process
with the new plant, which produces solid recovered fuels and biogas from
household garbage.

1.4.6.1.4 Citelum

Awholly owned subsidiary of the EDF group since 2014, Citelurm is one of
the leading players in public lighting, not only in France, but throughout
the rest of Europe and indeed worldwide.

With roughly 450 employees in France, Citelum employs close to
3,000 persons, active primarily in Europe (including France, Italy, Spain,
and Denmark) and in the Americas (including the United States, Mexico,
Brazil, and Chile).

Citelum accompanies cities and industries towards a more intelligent, more
economic, and safer world of light. Citelum develops its expertise in street
lighting in the areas of road signals, lighting installation and connected
urban services: in particular, video-protection, recharging of electric vehicles

The positioning of Edelia today is that of a captive subsidiary contributing
a capacity of innovation to the EDF group on the “smarthome and data”
topics (exchanges of data between connected objects in the home, in order
to enhance services).

Electric mobility

The transportation sector today is very dependent upon fossil energies,
which emit CO,. Low-carbon electricity constitutes a lever for developing
electric mobility which is more respectful of the environment. This is why
EDF, the champion of low-carbon growth, is investing in this field, particularly
through its subsidiary Sodetrel.

The Group’s commercial offering includes:

subject to the provisions of Order no. 2014-948 of 20 August 2014 on the
governance and equity transactions of companies with a public shareholding
and its implementing Decree no. 2014-949 of the same date.

The French Government Shareholding Agency (APE), which was founded
by Decree no. 2004-963 of 9 September 2004, fulfils the State’s remit in
its capacity as Company shareholder and, in this respect, proposes and
implements the State's decisions and guidelines, in consultation with the
ministers concerned.

In accordance with the legislation that applies to all undertakings of which
the State is a majority shareholder, EDF may have to undergo certain State
audit procedures, in particular through an economic and financial evaluation
assignment, pursuant to Decree no. 55-733 of 26 May 1955 on State
economic and financial evaluation and Decree no. 53-707 of 9 August 1953
on State evaluation of national public undertakings and certain organisations,
the purpose of which has an economic or social component.

EDF also has to undergo the audit procedures performed by the French
General Accounting Office (Cour des Comptes) and Parliament. Thus, in
addition to the control performed by the statutory auditors, the Company's
accounts and management and, where applicable, those of its directly-held
majority subsidiaries, fall under the control of the French General Accounting
Office, in accordance with Articles L. 111-4, L. 133-1 and L. 133-2 of the
French Code of Financial Jurisdiction.

Moreover, the Legislative Decree of 30 October 1935 allows the Minister for
the Economy to have EDF audited by the General Finance Inspection Office.

Lastly, the disposal of EDF shares by the State, or the dilution of the
State's stake in EDF's capital, is subject to a specific procedure under Order
no. 2014-948 of 20 August 2014 on the governance and equity transactions
of companies with a public shareholding. Among other things, this Order
simplified the previous rules that resulted from the so-called “privatisation”
Laws no. 86-793 of 2 July 1986, no. 86-912 of 6 August 1986 and
no. 93-923 of 19 July 1993.

1.5.2 PUBLIC SERVICE IN FRANCE

Statutory definition of public service in France

Articles L. 121-1 et seg. of the French Energy Code outline the public
electricity service (see section 1.5.3.2 “French legislation: Energy Code”
below for a description of this regulation).

Public service missions

Articles L. 121-1 et seg. of the French Energy Code state that the purpose
of the public electricity service is, inter alia, to guarantee electricity supply
throughout French territory, while acting in the general interest, to develop
and operate public electricity networks and to supply electricity at regulated
sales tariffs and at the basic necessity rate.

Balanced development of electricity
supply mission

The purpose of the balanced development of electricity supply mission,
which is defined in Article L. 121-3 of the French Energy Code, is to achieve
the objectives defined in the multi-year energy plan (PPE), which Law
no. 2015-992 of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth
substituted for the multi-year generation investment plan (PPI). Defined by
decree, the PPE sets out priority courses of action for the public authorities
for the management of all forms of energy in continental metropolitan
France. It must be compatible with the greenhouse gas emission reduction
targets set in the carbon budget and the low carbon strategy, which are
defined by Decree no. 2015-1491 of 18 November 2015, pursuant to the
aforementioned Law of 17 August 2015.

The PPE contains sections on (i) the security of supply, (ii) improving energy
efficiency and reducing primary energy consumption, in particular fossil fuel,
(iii) developing the utilisation of renewable energies and energy recovery,
(iv) the balanced development of energy networks, storage, conversion
and the energy demand monitoring, (v) the preservation of consumer
purchasing power and the competitiveness of energy prices, in particular
for undertakings that are exposed to international competition and (vi) the
evaluation of the needs for professional skills in the field of energy and how
training courses can be adapted to these needs.

It defines the quantitative objectives for the plan and the maximum indicative
budget for the public funds that the State and its public institutions
will mobilise in order to attain them. This budget is defined in terms of
commitments and accomplishments. It may be broken down by objective
and by industry sector.

The first PPE must cover an initial period of three years (2016-2018), then
a second period of five years (2019-2023). Subsequent PPEs will be drawn
up for two successive five-year periods.

The initial guidelines and actions for the period 2016-2023 that are contained
in the PPE were presented and submitted for consultation on 19 November
2015, during the second meeting of the committee tasked with monitoring
the PPE. The PPE is expected to be approved by decree and presented to
Parliament in 2016.

The balanced development of electricity supply mission also involves
guaranteeing the supply of areas that are not interconnected to continental
metropolitan France (Corsica, and the overseas departments and territories)
and some islands of Brittany.

As a power producer, EDF, along with the other producers, contributes to
the performance of this mission.

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

Mission to develop and operate public
transmission and distribution networks

The mission to develop and operate the public electricity transmission and
distribution networks, which is defined in Article L. 121-4 of the French
Energy Code, involves ensuring:

= a rational electricity distribution service in France through the public
transmission and distribution networks, in a way that is environmentally
friendly, interconnection with neighbouring countries; and

™ a connection and access to the public transmission and distribution
networks, under non-discriminatory conditions.

The public network managers that are designated by law are responsible for
this mission, namely RTE for transmission, ERDF and the Local Distribution
Companies (LDCs) for distribution and EDF in the areas not interconnected
to the continental metropolitan network.

The public service mission to supply electricity, which is defined in Article
L. 121-5 of the French Energy Code, involves ensuring the supply of
electricity throughout France to customers who benefit from regulated
electricity sales tariffs.

By law, this mission has been entrusted to EDF and to the LDCs.

The conditions under which customers can benefit from regulated electricity
sales tariffs are defined in Articles L. 337-7 et seq. of the French Energy Code.

The mission to supply electricity also involves the application of the special
“basic necessity” rate (TPN). This public service mission is assigned to all
electricity suppliers. The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition
for Green Growth provides for the gradual replacement of the TPN by the
“energy voucher”. This voucher is a special mean of payment that allows
households that are experiencing financial difficulties to cover part of
their energy consumption expenses (electricity, gas, fuel oil, etc.) or their
expenditure on improving the energy efficiency of their homes. The voucher
system will first undergo an experimental phase before becoming standard
practice by 1 January 2018 at the latest, in accordance with conditions that
are to be defined by a decree.

The mission to supply electricity moreover includes supplying emergency
power to customers who are connected to the public networks. The relevant
administrative authority designates emergency suppliers through one or
more tendering procedures. As the implementing regulations have not yet
been adopted at the date of this reference document, this provision has
still not entered into force.

Social cohesion

Article L. 121-5 of the French Energy Code provides that the supply of
electricity at regulated tariffs must contribute to social cohesion, in particular
through the national equalisation of regulated electricity sale tariffs.

Article L. 115-3 of the French Social Action and Families Code prohibits
electricity suppliers from cutting off electricity supplies to the primary
residences of individuals or families during the winter period (from
1 November to 31 March) due to unpaid bills, including through contract
termination. Electricity suppliers may, nevertheless, in certain cases, reduce
the power supplied, except with regard to customers who benefit from the
TPN or the “energy voucher”.

In its capacity as an electricity supplier, EDF is required to maintain electricity
supplies under the conditions laid down by said Article and by Decree
no. 2008-780 of 13 August 2008 on the procedure that is applicable in
the event of unpaid electricity, gas, heating and water bills, implemented in
its amended form pursuant to Decree no. 2014-274 of 27 February 2014.

78 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

Public Service Contract

On 24 October 2005, a Public Service Contract was signed by the State and
EDF pursuant to Article L. 121-46 of the French Energy Code. This contract,
which details the commitments made by EDF and the State and specifies
the rules governing the financial consideration for service commitments,
will remain in force until a new contract is signed, as provided for in the
contract itself.

Commitments by EDF (excluding network managers)

EDF's public service commitments include:

™ access to the public electricity service and the supply of electricity to
customers who choose to continue to benefit from regulated tariffs;

™ production and sales. These areas include the implementation of
the energy policy and maintaining secure power generation that is
environmentally friendly;

= contributing to the safety of the electricity network. In this regard,
EDF undertakes to enter into several contracts with RTE, in particular
concerning the optimisation of work on generation facilities and the
availability of the resources required to maintain network balance.

Commitments by network managers

In the Public Service Contract, the ERDF and RTE network managers made
commitments concerning the management of the public networks for the
transmission and distribution of electricity and the safety of the electricity
system. These commitments are financed by the Tariff for Using the Public
Electricity transmission and distribution Networks (TURPE).

These commitments concern, above all, network safety, supply quality, third
party safety and the preservation of the environment — four areas where
customers’ and local authorities’ expectations are especially high.

More accessible services

On 28 September 2010, the State and EDF, as well as eight other major public
service operators, signed a partnership agreement entitled “+ de services au
public” (“more services to the public”), which aims to develop access to a
set of services intended for rural populations in France (information on bill
payment, general information, travel ticket sales, etc.).

Reception staff and internet access points are some of the many resources
made available to users through shared facilities such as Multiservice
Conciliation and Information Points (PIMMS), Public Service Relays (RSP)
and other structures such as town halls. Following the experimental phase,
during which these services were deployed in 22 French départements, in
July 2013, the Inter-Ministerial Committee for the Modernisation of Public
Action (CIMAP) decided to extend this initiative throughout France.

1.5.3 ELECTRICITY MARKET LEGISLATION

1.5.3.1 European Legislation

Three European Directives, which form the basis for the current organisation
of the electricity market in France, were successively adopted in order to
lay down the common rules for the generation, transmission, distribution
and supply of electricity. Directive no. 96/92/EC of 19 December 1996 laid
the principles of the opening up of the electricity market to competition.


--- Page 68 ---

Directive no. 2003/54/EC of 26 June 2003 reiterated the major principles
and took an additional step on the path to opening up the market, by
progressively expanding eligibility to all customers.

Directive no. 2009/72/EC of 13 July 2009, known as the “Third Directive”,
was adopted as part of the third “Energy Package”. This directive primarily
strengthens the guarantees of the independence of transmission network
managers and increases the power of the national regulatory authorities.
These provisions have now been incorporated into the French Energy Code.

Moreover, the rules that govern the conditions for access to the network
for cross-border exchanges in electricity are currently defined by Regulation
(EC) no. 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July
2009, which is part of the third Energy Package. This Regulation, inter alia,
provides for a compensation mechanism between transmission network
operators for the costs incurred by hosting cross-border flows of electricity
on their networks. This compensation is paid by the operators of the national
transmission networks from which cross-border flows originate and the
networks where those flows end.

Finally, the “Security of Electricity Supply” Directive no. 2005/89/EC, which
was adopted on 18 January 2006, is intended to provide a better definition of
the responsibilities of the various operators, ensure that minimum operational
standards are respected, maintain balance between demand and supply, and
direct investments toward the networks. The objectives of this directive have
been taken into account in various French laws and regulations.

The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators

Regulation (EC) no. 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 13 July 2009, established an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy
Regulators (ACER). The ACER has a role in developing network codes in the
electricity and gas sectors, and can make decisions relating to cross-border
infrastructures (on this subject, see also section 1.5.6.2.5 “Regulations
applicable to renewable energy generation”).

1.5.3.2. French legislation: Energy Code

The various pieces of legislation on energy law' were incorporated into
the French Energy Code by Order no. 2011-504 of 9 May 2011, with the
exception of provisions on nuclear energy, which were incorporated into
the French Environment Code, pursuant to Order no. 2012-6 of 5 January
2012. Moreover, Decree no. 2015-1823 of 30 December 2015 organised
the regulatory section of the French Energy Code. Consequently, around
one hundred decrees on energy law have been repealed.

The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth
amended numerous provisions of the French Energy Code, and in particular
the objectives of the energy policy, which are now focused on the emergence
of a competitive economy that creates an abundance of jobs through the
mobilisation of all the industrial sectors (in particular the green growth
sectors), security of supply and the reduction of reliance on imports,
competitive and attractive energy prices, the preservation of human and
environmental health, social and territorial cohesion, the fight against fuel
poverty, and the contribution of an implementation of a European Energy
Union.

Generation facilities

Anyone can operate an electricity generation facility provided that, above a
certain power threshold determined by decree, an operating licence issued
pursuant to Article L. 311-5 of the French Energy Code is obtained. The

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

powers and responsibilities of local authorities with regard to electricity
generation are defined in Articles L. 2224-32 and L. 2224-33 of the French
Local Authorities Code, and in Article 88 of Law no. 2010-788 of 12 July
2010 on the national commitment to the environment.

Regulated Access to Electricity from the Existing
Nuclear Fleet (ARENH)

The rules governing Regulated Access to Electricity from the Existing Nuclear
Fleet (ARENH), provided for in Articles L. 336-1 et seq. of the French Energy
Code, have been implemented since 1 July 2011. See section 1.4.3.3
“Regulated Access to Electricity from the Existing Nuclear Fleet (ARENH)”
on this point.

Choice of electricity supplier

All customers, without exception, have been eligible since 1 July 2007, i.e.
they may freely sign a contract for the purchase of electricity with a producer
or supplier of their choice that is established on the territory of the European
Union or on the territory of a State that is party to an international agreement
with France (Article L. 331-1 of the French Energy Code).

Customers can choose to benefit from regulated electricity sales tariffs under
the conditions set out in Articles L. 337-7 et seq. of the French Energy Code.
Pursuant to these provisions:

= household and non-household final consumers whose power demand
is less than or equal to 36kVA benefit, at their request, from regulated
sales tariffs; this is also true for all customers in areas that are not
interconnected to continental metropolitan France;

= household and non-household final consumers whose power demand is
greater than 36kVA, who had not exercised their eligibility on 7 December
2010 were able to benefit from regulated sales tariffs until 31 December
2015. Since 1 January 2016, these consumers have no longer been able
to benefit from regulated tariffs. Article 25 of Law no. 2014-344 of
17 March 2014 on consumption provided for a six-month transitional
period, during which customers who had not signed a new contract with
the supplier of their choice before 31 December 2015 could, in order to
guarantee the continuity of their electricity supply, continue to benefit
from a contract with EDF? during a maximum transitional period of six
months, at the end of which they would no longer be supplied. Customers
may terminate this contract at any time with no indemnity. EDF? has an
obligation to inform the customers concerned, by letter, of the expiration
of the transitional contract three months and one month before it ends.
Order no. 2016-129 of 10 February 2016 provides for a system to ensure
‘the continuity of gas and electricity supplies for customers who have still
not accepted a market-based offer on 30 June 2016, starting on 1 July
2016. The CRE will launch the call for tenders for this contract, which
will cover the post-transitional offer period, in March 2016.

Article L. 111-84 of the French Energy Code requires internal accounts to
be kept that make it possible to distinguish between supply to customers.
who exercised their right to eligibility and supply to customers at regulated
tariffs. The State and the CRE have a right of access to the electricity
companies’ accounts.

Third-party access to networks

Article L. 111-91 of the French Energy Code provides that network managers
must guarantee access to the public transmission and distribution networks
in order to:

= perform the public service missions to supply electricity at regulated
electricity sales tariffs and at basic necessity special rates;

= perform electricity procurement contracts;

= perform electricity export agreements signed by a producer or by a
supplier who is located on French national territory.

Disputes concerning third-party access to networks are heard by the
Settlement of Disputes and Sanctions Committee (CoRDIS), which is part
of the CRE.

The Tariffs for Using the Public transmission and distribution Networks
(TURPE) mentioned in Articles L. 341-2 et seq. of the French Energy Code,
which are currently in force, were established by the CRE Decision of
3 April 2013, which was published in the Journal officiel of 30 June 2013,
for transmission (TURPE 4 HTB), and by the CRE Decision of 12 December
2013, which was published in the Journal officiel of 20 December 2013,
for distribution (TURPE 4 HTA/BT).

Supporting mecha
of generation

EDF is subject to purchase obligations that result in contracts being entered
into with the operators of facilities. The purchase obligation framework,
which was created by Law no. 2000-108 of 10 February 2000 on the
modernisation and development of the public electricity service, was
amended by Law no. 2015-992 of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition
for Green Growth, which clarify some aspects of the regime and create a
new form of subsidy in the guise of additional remuneration. The supporting
mechanism for certain subsidiaries of generation under the aforementioned
Law of 17 August 2015 now includes three separate sets of rules.

Firstly, the purchase obligation regime provided for by Articles L. 314-1 et
seq. of the French Energy Code. These articles provide that EDF (as well
as the LDCs that are responsible for supply in their service area) must sign
purchase contracts, at the request of producers, for the electricity generated
by technology sectors, the development of which the public authorities wish
to support, either because they utilise sources of renewable energies, or
because they have a specific form of energy efficiency (e.g. cogeneration).

Article R. 314-6 of the French Energy Code provides that producer who
benefits from the purchase obligation must sell all of his production to EDF
under agreements entered into on the basis of indicative models approved
by the Minister for Energy. Purchasing terms and conditions, specifically
the electricity purchase prices, are set by order of the Minister for Energy
and Economy.

Secondly, the additional remuneration regime, which was introduced by
Law no. 2015-992 of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green
Growth, is governed by Articles L. 314-18 et seq. of the French Energy
Code. The additional remuneration takes the form of a premium that is paid
to producers as a complement to their income from selling the electricity
they produce on the market, as well as the assignment of their capacity
guarantees. In this respect, EDF will be obliged to enter into an additional
remuneration contract with eligible producers who request one and with
certain producers who currently benefit from a purchase obligation and
who wish to benefit from an additional remuneration agreement for the
remainder of the term of their initial purchase contract.

80 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

The additional remuneration, for which the implementing legislation will
be published over the course of 2016, is designed to partially substitute the
purchase obligation system for certain facilities.

Finally, the tendering procedure which, pursuant to Articles L. 311-10 et
seq. of the French Energy Code, may be initiated by the Minister for Energy
when production capacities do not meet the targets of the multi-year energy
plan. EDF is required, excluded areas of the LDCs, to enter into an electricity
purchase contract or a contract that provides for additional remuneration
(this is a memorandum of understanding in the event that it is EDF itself
in the capacity of “producer” that is chosen) with the selected bidder(s).

The additional costs for EDF and for the LDCs resulting from contracts
signed pursuant to the obligation to purchase energy and the complement
of income are compensated by the State and funded in particular by a
contribution received from final consumers, the Contribution to Public
Electricity Service costs or “CSPE”.

Mechanism for compensating the additional costs
of public service

The Contribution to Public Electricity Service costs (CSPE)

Article L. 121-6 of the French Energy Code lays down the principle that the
State must compensate in full the costs that are attributable to the public
service generation and supply missions that are assigned to EDF and the LDCs.

For electricity generation, the expenses defined by Article L. 121-7 of the
French Energy Code include:

® the additional costs that result both from electricity purchase agreements
entered into by EDF and the LDCs after tendering procedures (Articles
L. 311-10 et seq. of the French Energy Code) and from purchase
obligation agreements signed within the framework of Articles L. 314-1
et seq. of the French Energy Code, as well as additional remuneration
agreements that are entered into pursuant to Articles L. 314-18 et seq.
of the French Energy Code;

@ inareas that are not interconnected to continental metropolitan France:

additional generation costs that are not covered by the generation
portion in regulated sales tariffs, the costs of storage facilities managed
by the electricity system manager, within the limits of the additional
generation costs they help to avoid,

additional electricity procurement costs (other than those, mentioned
above, linked to the purchase obligation) that are not covered by the
generation portion in regulated sales tariffs, within the limit of the
additional generation costs they help to avoid,

the costs paid by electricity suppliers in respect of energy demand
control initiatives, less any income received through these initiatives,
within the limit of the additional generation costs they help to avoid;

m the costs of studies paid by a producer or supplier with a view to
implementing electricity supply projects that are identified in the decree
on the multi-year energy plan.

For the supply of electricity, the costs defined in Article L. 121-8 of the
French Energy Code include:

@ the loss of income and the additional costs incurred by suppliers due to
the implementation of the special “basic necessity” rate (TPN);

@ the costs incurred by suppliers as a result of their participation in the plan
established for low-income persons (within the limit of a percentage,
which is set by order, of the cost borne by the supplier in respect of the
TPN for the year in question).

Moreover, in accordance with Law no. 2013-312 of 15 April 2013 on the
preparation of the transition towards a low energy system (known as the


--- Page 70 ---

“Brottes Act”), which, in particular, completed Article L. 121-10 of the
French Energy Code, the purpose of the CSPE is to finance the premium
owed to the demand response managers pursuant to Articles L. 123-1 and
L. 271-1 of the same Code.

The mechanism for compensating public service costs, which is governed by
Articles L. 121-9 et seq. of the French Energy Code, was reformed by Law
no. 2015-1786 of 29 December 2015 (the Amended Budget Act for 2015),
which aims to secure the financing of the costs of the public electricity service.

The compensation of public electricity service costs will now be financed by
revenue from the domestic tax on the final consumption of electricity (the
TICFE), now known as the Contribution to Public Electricity Service costs
(CSPE). The CSPE will be collected directly from final consumers of electricity
in the form of an additional levy on the sale price of electricity or directly
from electricity producers that produce electricity for their own needs.

The amount of the CSPE is set at €22.50/MWh as from 1 January 2016
(i.e. the rate that would have been set for the CSPE if it had not been
reformed). As an exception, for electro-intensive and hyper-electro-intensive
undertakings and distribution companies, reduced tariffs of between €0.5/
MWh and €7.5/MWh have been defined.

The financing of public electricity (and gas) service costs is now provided
exclusively by the State budget, as follows:

= The costs linked to energy transition, which correspond to subsidy
mechanisms for renewable energies, as well as the reimbursement of
the compensation deficit supported by EDF, are recognised in a special
purpose account (CAS) for “energy transition” that was created by the
Amended Budget Act for 2015. Revenue for this CAS is for the most
part allocated to the CSPE, as well as a fraction of the domestic tax on
energy products (TICPE), the domestic tax on the consumption of natural
gas (TICGN) and the domestic tax on coals, lignite and coke (TICC).

= The other public service costs (fuel poverty, tariff equalisation in areas not
interconnected to metropolitan France, cogeneration, and the budget for
the energy conciliator, etc.) are entered directly in the general budget.

Decree no. 2016-158 of 18 February 2016 specifies the rules for determining
the costs that can be attributed to public service energy missions, the
procedure for determining the amount of the costs to be compensated for
each operator, and the transactions for paying the compensations to the
operators who bear the expenses.

Each year, the CRE records the amount of the costs that can be attributed,
in respect of the previous year, to public service energy missions that are the
responsibility of the operators, assesses, for the following year, the provisional
amount of the same costs and updates the forecast of costs for the pending
year. Within this framework, it identifies the costs that are allocated to the
CAS “energy transition” special purpose account.

The CRE addresses to the Minister for Energy, each year before 15 July, its
estimation of costs.

The massive expansion of facilities that generate electricity using renewable
energy sources (mainly wind power and photovoltaic facilities) and that
benefit from the purchase obligation, for several years has led to a significant
increase in the costs to be compensated by the CSPE. This phenomenon
continues today: accordingly, the CRE cost forecasts for 2015 (€6.3 billion)
are 20% higher than the costs recorded for 2013 (€5.3 billion). Since 2007,
the amount of the CSPE has not been enough to compensate the increase
in these costs (except for 2015). The deficit of a mechanism that is paid for
exclusively by EDF weighs on the Group's debt.

In January 2013, EDF announced that it had reached an agreement with
the public authorities, which provides for the repayment of the debt formed
by the CSPE deficit at 31 December 2012 (around €4.3 billion, adjusted to
€5.0 billion at 31 December 2013 to take into account on the one hand the
deficits related to public service charges at 31 December 2012, as confirmed
by the CRE decision of 9 October 2013 and on the other the brokerage

costs incurred by the Group of €0.6 billion). Under this agreement, this debt
corresponding to the CSPC's deficit is to be paid off by 31 December 2018,
according to a progressive repayment schedule, and is to be remunerated
at a rate of 1.72% in accordance with the Decree of 7 October 2014. In
the context of the reform of the CSPE, EDF and the public authorities have
agreed to add the existing debt to the net accrued compensation recognised
by the CRE in respect of the years 2013-2015 (i.e. an additional amount of
€644 million). The initial repayment scheme, which was revised in agreement
with the State, is now included in a Ministerial order that is expected to be
published in the first half of 2016.

Compensation for additional distribution costs

The purpose of the Electricity Equalisation Fund (FPE), the accounting
management of which is entrusted to EDF under Article L. 121-29 of the
French Energy Code, is to distribute the charges incurred as a result of
public service missions assigned for managing the electricity distribution
networks among the operators concerned, in particular those linked to the
specificities of the networks operated and that will not be covered by the
portion relating to the use of those networks in the regulated tariffs or by the
tariffs for using the public electricity distribution networks. The costs linked
to involvement in the development of areas with particular geographical,
economic or social difficulties, as defined by Article 42 of Law no. 95-115,
of 4 February 1995, are also concerned.

Capacity guarantees

Articles L. 335-1 et seq. of the French Energy Code, which are taken from
the NOME Act (New Organisation of the Electricity Market — Nouvelle
Organisation du Marché de |’Electricité), obligate each electricity supplier
to contribute to the security of electricity supply in continental metropolitan
France, in light of its customers’ power and energy consumption patterns.
Each supplier must therefore provide annually, under penalty of an
administrative sanction, an amount of guarantees of capacity according
to its customers’ consumption at peak periods. Suppliers will obtain these
capacity guarantees from generation or load operators, which must first
have their capacities certified by the public transport network manager.

The aims of this mechanism are:

= to make it possible to maintain or develop generation or load shedding
capacities that ensure the level of supply security set by the public
authorities;

= to improve the remuneration of these capacities;
= to share the expense of this security of supply among all suppliers.

The “capacity mechanism rules” proposed by RTE were approved by a
ministerial order of 22 January 2015 after consulting the CRE.

The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth
adapted the capacity mechanism to small stakeholders by allowing the LDCs
to transfer their capacity obligations not only to another LDC, but also “to
any other supplier” and by allowing electricity suppliers to transfer their
capacity obligations to a final consumer or to a public network manager
(Article L. 335-5 of the French Energy Code).

Moreover, Article L. 335-3 of the French Energy Code introduced the
possibility for all capacity operators to transfer to a third party their liability
for discrepancies between effective capacity and certified capacity on the
one hand, and the payment of the penalties in respect of said discrepancies
on the other.

On 13 November 2015, the European Commission opened an in-depth
investigation on the planned French capacity mechanism, in light of European
rules on State aids.

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

Electricity load shedding

The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth
amended the legal rules on load shedding and, in particular, Articles L. 271-1
et seq. of the French Energy Code on this subject.

These provisions amend the previous legal rules and stipulate, in particular:

® that load shedding is defined “as the action to reduce temporarily the
effective withdrawal level of electricity from the public electricity supply
and distribution networks by one or more consumption sites, compared
to a forward-looking consumption plan or an estimated consumption,
when an ad hoc request is sent to one or more final consumers by a
load manager or an electricity supplier’;

= that there is the possibility for consumers to monetize each of their
demand responses, either via their supplier as part of a demand response
offer that is inseparable from the supply, or via the intermediary of load
managers;

= that the Government will organise calls for tenders if the load
management capacities do not meet the targets of the multi-year energy
plan (this mechanism replaces that of the load shedding premium);

= finally, for load shedding that leads to significant energy savings, the law
provides that the administrative authority may require the payment to
the supplier to be shared between the load manager and RTE.

The terms of application of these mechanisms will be detailed by decrees
and entail the amendment of two sets of rules that were adopted pursuant
to the previous regulations: the rules for trading load shedding reserves on
the energy markets, known as the “Nebef 2.0” Rules, which were approved
by the CRE decision of 17 December 2014 on the one hand, and the rules
on incorporating load shedding reserves into the adjustment mechanism
that are contained in the rules on planning, the adjustment mechanism
and the recovery of cost adjustments, in the version approved by the CRE
decision of 3 December 2015 on the other.

Elect

ity sector regulation

The Energy Regulation Commission

The Energy Regulation Commission (CRE) is an independent administrative
authority created by Article 28 of the Law of 10 February 2000.

Articles L. 131-1 et seq. of the French Energy Code give a general definition
of the remit of the CRE, which is tasked with contributing to the correct
functioning of the electricity and natural gas markets for the benefit of final
consumers. In this respect, the CRE ensures, in particular, that the conditions
for access to electricity and natural gas transmission and distribution networks
do not impede the development of competition.

The CRE has significant powers: power to make proposals, advisory powers
and decision-making powers (approval power and regulatory power).

The CRE makes proposals, in particular, to the Ministers for the Economy
and for Energy regarding an amount of costs that are attributable to the
public service missions assigned to power producers, and a net amount of
related contributions. Once the decree has been published that specifies
the methods for identifying and recognising the costs that are taken into
account for the calculation of the ARENH price, the CRE will propose the
ARENH price. Moreover, since 7 December 2015, it is its responsibility to
propose changes in the regulated sales and transfer tariffs for electricity,
on which it previously could only issue an opinion.

The CRE now has decision-making power to set the Tariffs for Using the
Public Electricity transmission and distribution Networks (TURPE): it notifies
its reasoned decision to the administrative authority, which can only ask the
CRE for a new decision in the event of non-compliance with energy policy

82 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

guidelines. Under its residual regulatory power, the CRE takes network
connection decisions, as well as decisions to define the rules for calculating
and adjusting the rights of suppliers to the ARENH.

The CRE is also vested with very broad powers that enable it to obtain any
information that it may deem useful for the fulfilment of its remit, as well as
authority to settle disputes and to apply penalties, through the Settlement
of Disputes and Sanctions Committee (CoRDIS).

The Law on the Energy Transition for Green Growth of 17 August 2015 also
gives the CRE the possibility of having the information it obtains through its
remits audited, at the expense of the audited undertakings.

1.5.4 GAS MARKET LEGISLATION

1.5.4.1 European legislation

Directive no. 98/30/EC of 22 June 1998 and Directive no. 2003/55/EC of
26 June 2003 were the major steps towards opening up the gas market
to competition.

New rules aimed at improving the functioning of the internal natural gas
market were defined in Directive no. 2009/73/EC of 13 July 2009, and by
Regulation (EC) no. 715/2009 of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to
the natural gas transmission networks.

Pursuant to this legislation, two network codes for capacity allocation
mechanisms (CAM) and balancing rules officially entered into force on
1 November and 1 October 2015 respectively. The first requires the
capacities at interconnection points between transmission networks to be
commercialised by bundling the output capacity of the first network with the
input capacity of the second network, and by selling these interconnection
capacities via auction. The purpose of the second is to harmonise the
balancing rules on transmission networks.

1.5.4.2 French legislation:
the French Energy Code

Directive no. 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 13 July 2009 was transposed into French law by Order no. 2011-504 of
9 May 2011, which organised the legislative section of the French Energy
Code. The French Energy Code entered into force on 1 June 2011.

Access to natural gas networks

The French Energy Code provides that customers, suppliers and their
agents have a right to access natural gas transmission and distribution
infrastructures, as well as LNG facilities, under the terms and conditions set
forth in an agreement with the operators that run them.

Natural gas network operators must refrain from discriminating between
users or categories of users in any way.

Customers

Since 1 July 2007, all customers can freely choose their supplier.

Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 445-4 of the French Energy
Code, household and non-household customers who consume less than
30,000kWh per year may benefit from regulated tariffs, at their request
and without having to meet any conditions. Household customers who are
entitled to the special “basic necessity” rate for electricity may benefit from


--- Page 72 ---

a special solidarity tariff that is applicable to the supply of natural gas for
part of their consumption. This special tariff will progressively be replaced
by the “energy voucher” system (see section 3.2.3.6.1 “Contributing to
energy access and the fight against energy poverty”).

Customers whose consumption exceeds 30,000kWh per year can only benefit
from regulated gas sales tariffs for a site if no new market offering offer
has been accepted for such site, pursuant to Article L. 445-4 paragraph 2
of the French Energy Code.

Non-household final customers who consume more than 30,000kWh per
year and who still benefit from the regulated tariffs for the sale of natural
gas that are stipulated in Article L. 445-3 of the French Energy Code have
no longer been eligible for these tariffs since the following dates:

= for non-household consumers who are connected to the transmission
network, since 18 June 2014;

= for non-household consumers whose consumption level exceeds
200,000kWh per year, since 31 December 2014;

= for non-household consumers whose consumption level exceeds
30,000kWh per year, since 31 December 2015.

If they did not sign a new supply contract with a supplier by these dates,
and in order to benefit from the continuity of their gas supply, the customers
concerned benefit from a contract with their supplier for a transitional
period of six months, at the end of which they are no longer supposed
to be supplied. Pursuant to these provisions, non-household consumers
who consume more than 200,000kWh of natural gas per year and who
have not signed a contract with a supplier of their choice, on 1 January
2015 were automatically switched to the transitional offer system. When
the aforementioned period of six months expired, these consumers were
supposed to have accepted a market-based offer from the supplier of their
choice, failing which their supply of natural gas was supposed to have
been cut.

In a decision of 28 May 2015, the CRE found that around 10,000 non-
household consumers, including numerous local authorities and joint owners’
associations, apparently had not signed a gas purchase contract in response
toa market-based offer by 30 June 2015, thereby exposing themselves to a
risk of their supplies being cut. It therefore decided to maintain supplies to
the sites concerned by the manager of the distribution network for a final
period of three months, i.e. until September 2015, at a price increased by
20% compared to the regulated tariff, in order to encourage these customers
to accept a market-based offer, before gradually cutting them off.

Suppliers

Article L. 443-4 of the French Energy Code defines suppliers as persons who
(i) are established on the territory of a Member State of the European Union
or on the territory of another State pursuant to international agreements,
and (ii) hold a licence issued by the Minister for Energy.

EDF is authorised to supply natural gas to non-household customers that
do not provide services in the public interest, pursuant to an Order of the
Deputy Minister of Industry of 14 September 2004, and, pursuant to an
Order of 9 August 2005, to non-household customers that provide services
in the public interest, as well as to natural gas distributors and suppliers, and,
pursuant to an Order of 15 June 2007, to household customers.

EDF only supplies its customers with a market offering and not at regulated
sales tariffs, which can only be proposed by Engie (previously GDF Suez)
and the LDCs tasked with supplying gas.

Underground storage and third-party access to natural
gas storage fac Ss

Article L. 421-4 of the French Energy Code requires all suppliers to hold, on
31 October of each year, directly or indirectly through an agent, sufficient

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

inventories of natural gas in France to meet their direct or indirect contractual
obligations to supply household customers and other customers that provide
services in the public interest or that have not contractually accepted an
interruptible gas supply, during the period between 1 November and
31 March.

Articles R. 421-1 to R. 421-2 of the French Energy Code specify the legal
framework that applies to underground storage facilities for natural gas.

Control and penalties

The French Energy Code grants the Minister for the Economy and the
Minister for Energy, as well as the Energy Regulation Commission, power
to oversee the gas market. The Minister for Energy may also levy a fine, or
withdraw or suspend an authorisation to supply natural gas. The CRE can
carry out investigations into whether offences that breach the provisions
of the French Energy Code have been committed (Article L. 135-13 of the
French Energy Code).

1.5.5 PUBLIC ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION
CONCESSIONS

French legal system applicable to concessions

In accordance with Articles L. 121-4 et seg. and L. 322-1 et seq. of the French
Energy Code, and Article L. 2224-31 of the French Local Authorities Code, the
public distribution of electricity is operated under a system of public service
concessions. Pursuant to this body of law, the contracting authorities organise
the public electricity distribution service through concession agreements and
general specifications that set forth the respective rights and obligations of
the concession grantor and concession holder. Currently, the contracting
authorities are most often public institutions formed by associations of
several municipalities cooperating together, however contracting authorities
at département level are becoming more common.

The unbundling of supply and network operations required under Community
Directives has led to the identification of two separate public service missions:
firstly, the mission to supply electricity at regulated tariffs assigned to EDF
and the LDCs in their exclusive service areas and, secondly, the mission to
develop and operate the public electricity distribution networks assigned
to ERDF and the LDCs in their service areas, and to EDF for areas which are
not interconnected to the continental metropolitan network.

Article L. 334-3 of the French Energy Code provides that the signature of
new concession agreements and amendments, as well as renewals of existing
concession agreements, must be executed by three parties: the contracting
authority, the distribution network manager (for the provisions relating to
management of the public distribution network) and by EDF (or the LDC
that has the authority in the geographic area) for supply at regulated tariffs.
The current concession agreements in force are deemed to have been signed
jointly by these three entities.

In accordance with the Order no. 2016-65 of 29 January 2016 on
concession contracts and to the Decree no. 2016-86 of 1 February 2016,
transposing into national law the European Directive no. 2014/23/UE of
26 February 2014, award of distribution and supply of electricity concession
contracts to regulated tariffs is not subject to compliance with the obligation
of competition.

Rights of the contracting authorities

The rights of the contracting authorities are detailed in section 1.4.4.2.2
(“Distribution activities”).

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

1.5.6 REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE
ENVIRONMENT, NUCLEAR POWER,
HEALTH, HYGIENE AND SAFETY

EDF's business in France, as well as in other countries where EDF operates, is
subject to regulations that are applicable to the environment, nuclear power,
health, hygiene and safety. Compliance with these increasingly strict and
continuously changing regulations exposes the Group to significant costs
in order to ensure it does business compliantly.

1.5.6.1. Basic regulations applicable
to the environment, health, hygiene
and safety

Environmental regula

Grenelle Laws 1 and 2

Following the Grenelle Environmental Forum that was initiated in 2007, in
Law no. 2009-967 of 3 August 2009, known as the “Grenelle 1 Law", the
French government undertook to meet a certain number of objectives and
to implement certain environmental measures concerning the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency, the development of renewable
energy sources, ensuring clean bodies of water, the protection of biodiversity,
the prevention of risks to health and the environment, waste management
and ecological governance.

These commitments and objectives were implemented by Law no. 2010-788
of 12 July 2010 (known as the “Grenelle 2 Law”), many provisions of which
impact EDF's activities.

Public involvement in environmental matters

The general framework for the public's involvement in the preparation of
regulatory and individual decisions by the public authorities that have an
impact on the environment is laid down in Articles L. 120-1 et seq. of the
French Environment Code. These provisions apply in the absence of specific
provisions that are laid down by specialised legislation.

This legal framework is, however, expected to change with the reform of
public involvement provided for by Law no. 2015-990 of 6 August 2015
on growth, business and equal opportunities (known as the “Macron
Act"), following the workshop on “participatory democracy” initiated by
the Government early in 2015 (see section 1.5.8.2 “Future regulations at
national level (France)").

Environmental Liability (the “LRE” Law)

The purpose of the Law of 1 August 2008 on environmental liability (LRE),
which is incorporated into the French Environment Code under Articles
L. 160-1 to L. 165-2, is to promote the prevention and remedying of
environmental damage to water, soil and biodiversity that reaches a certain
level of seriousness. The remedy must be environmental only and must allow
the natural environment to return to its previous state or an equivalent state.

Balanced management of water resources

The Water Framework Directive of 23 October 2000 is the foundation
of Community water policy. It defines a framework for the management
and protection of water, for each major river basin, and sets targets for
maintaining and restoring the status of surface waters, in particular to ensure
the correct ecological and/or chemical status of water by 2015.

In France, the Directive was primarily transposed into law through the Water
and Aquatic Environments Act of 30 December 2006, which stipulates the
measures that are designed to ensure that the Directive's targets are attained.

84 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

These targets are determined for each river basin in the master plans for
water development and management (SDAGEs). All EDF's activities that
could impact water and aquatic environments must be compatible with
the targets set in the SDAGEs.

The Water Act also requires the various uses of water to be reconciled. The
requisite balanced, sustainable management of water resources therefore has
consequences for the operating rights of hydropower plants, and indirectly
for all EDF's activities that affect aquatic environments.

Protection of biodiversity

As an occupant and user of natural land and water areas, EDF is directly
concerned by biodiversity issues.

In order to protect and restore biodiversity, the Grenelle Environmental
Forum set ambitious targets, which include the implementation of a national
strategy for the creation of protected land areas (SCAP), which aim to provide
extensive protection, by 2019, for at least 2% of metropolitan French land
mass, as well as the creation of a green and blue belt, a tool for land-use
planning that sets up green corridors to connect protected areas, thereby
enabling flora and fauna to migrate.

The provisions on the green and blue belt, as well as the contents of the
procedure for designing regional green coherence schemes (SRCE) that
implement it have been incorporated into the French Environment Code,
in Articles L. 371-1 to L. 371-6 and R. 371-16 to R. 371-35, and completed
by Decree no. 2012-1492 of 27 December 2012 and Decree no. 2014-45
of 20 January 2014.

A bill on the restoration of biodiversity, nature and landscapes, which is
currently being debated in Parliament, aims to improve the protection
of biodiversity (see section 1.5.8.2 “Future regulations at national level
(France)").

Comprehensive environmental authorisation and project
certificate

Three experimental procedures concerning the environment, which are
limited in time and confined to certain regions, were implemented pursuant
‘to the Law of 2 January 2014, which empowered the Government to simplify
and increase legal certainty for corporations.

Firstly, the experimental use of the project certificate (which was introduced
by Order no. 2014-356 of 20 March 2014, then completed by the Macron
Act of 6 August 2015). The project certificate is an instrument designed to
provide legal certainty and stabilise the law whereby the Prefect notifies a
commitment to a project manager regarding the various procedures to be
complied with and the timeframes for issuing the authorisations requested.

Secondly, experimental use of a comprehensive authorisation system that
is applicable to projects that require authorisation for facilities that are
classified for the protection of the environment (which was introduced by
Order no. 2014-355 of 20 March 2014, and completed by the Macron Act
and the Law of 17 August 2015), and to projects that require authorisation
under the Water Act (which was introduced by Order no. 2014-619 of
12 June 2014, completed by the Law of 17 August 2015). The comprehensive
authorisation system allows for a coordinated appraisal of authorisation
applications and the issuance in a single document, for a given project, of
all the decisions required of the State (see section 1.5.6.2.1 “Regulations
applicable to facilities classified for the protection of the environment (ICPE)")
The Macron Act empowers the Government to make these authorisations
permanent via an order.

These procedures are liable to apply to EDF's projects.

Social and environmental reporting obligation for businesses
(RSE)

Articles L. 225-102-1 and R. 225-104 of the French Commercial Code
require companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated
market, as well as companies that employ more than 500 staff and whose


--- Page 74 ---

revenue or balance sheet total exceeds €100 million, to disclose in the
management report information on how they take into consideration the
social and environmental consequences of their activity, as well as on their
societal commitments to sustainable development (“RSE reporting”). The Law
of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth completes
the list of the environmental information contained in the aforementioned
Article L. 225-102-1 by requiring undertakings to make public, as from the
financial year ended 21 December 2016, information on the consequences
of climate change for their business activity and the usage of the goods
and services they produce.

These provisions concern EDF and some of its subsidiaries.

Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code authorises subsidiaries
and controlled companies not to disclose their RSE information, provided that
this information is published by the company that controls them in detail by
subsidiary or by controlled company, and that they state how to access this
information in their own management report. Moreover, when subsidiaries
and controlled companies are established in France and have facilities that
are classified for the protection of the environment (ICPEs that are subject
to authorisation and registration), the information provided must concern
each of them, if the information cannot be consolidated.

The social and environmental information provided in the management
report must be verified according to a schedule that takes into account for
non-listed companies, the number of their employees and their revenue, by
a third party independent organisation, which is appointed in accordance
with the provisions of Article R. 225-105-2 of the French Commercial Code.
An Order of 13 May 2013 determined, in particular, the rules according to
which the independent third party organisation will perform its assignment.
The verification by this organisation leads to a certificate concerning the
presence in the management report of all the required information and
a substantiated opinion on the accuracy of the information itself (see
section 3.1 “Corporate responsibility commitments").

PCBs and PCTs

The Group is subject to regulations on polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and
polychloroterphenyls (PCTs) in the various countries where it operates,
particularly in Europe.

Directive no. 96/59/EC of 16 September 1996 required that an inventory
of equipment containing PCBs and PCTs at levels of more than 500 ppm.
be drawn up, together with a national plan for decontamination and the
gradual disposal of these substances, which are mainly found in certain
electricity transformers and condensers. Decontamination of equipment
containing these substances was to be completed by 31 December 2010 at
the latest. EDF had a special disposal plan and has achieved this objective.

Pursuant to Decree no. 2013-301 of 10 April 2013, EDF must clean up
and decontaminate polluted equipment at rates between 50 and 500ppm,
with the possibility, as the holder of more than 150 pieces of equipment,
of benefiting from a “specific plan” that is approved by order of the
Minister for the Environment. This plan must, as a minimum, provide for
the decontamination or destruction of one-half of the equipment before
1 January 2020 and all equipment before 31 December 2025. The contents of
the application for the specific plan were defined by an Order of 28 October
2013. RTE’s and ERDF's specific decontamination plans were approved by
two orders of 14 April and 3 July 2014.

The Decree of 10 April 2013 also specified the new obligations in terms of
identifying, labelling, declaring and using equipment with fluid containing
PCBs with a volume of more than 5dm?. The rules for conforming to
these obligations were stipulated in detail by two orders of 7 January and
14 January 2014.

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

Greenhouse gases

Allowance trading scheme

Some of the EDF Group’s activities fall within the scope of application of
Directive no. 2003/87/EC of 13 October 2003, as amended by Directive
no. 2009/29/EU of 23 April 2009, which established a European scheme
for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission allowance trading, using the project
mechanisms set forth in the Kyoto Protocol (the Emissions Trading System
(ETS) Directive).

In France, this Directive was transposed and integrated into Articles L. 229-5,
R. 229-5 et seq. of the French Environment Code. The Group has an annual
obligation to surrender allowances equal to the level of CO, emitted by its
facilities. In order to comply with this obligation, under certain conditions,
the Group may use credits issued under projects eligible for the project
mechanisms provided for under Articles 6 and 12 of the Kyoto Protocol
(joint implementation and clean development mechanism).

Under the ETS Directive, the third period for the greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission allowance trading scheme started on 1 January 2013. The provisions
of the French Environment Code on this scheme were amended accordingly
by Order no. 2012-827 of 28 June 2012 (ratified by Law no. 2013-619 of
16 July 2013) and by Decrees no. 2012-1343 of 3 December 2012 and
no. 2014-220 of 25 February 2014. Since 1 January 2013, the rule for the
electricity sector is the auctioning of quotas, in accordance with the rules
defined by Regulation (EU) no. 1031/2010 of 12 November 2010. Since
that date, EDF has to purchase 100% of its allowances.

In order to support the price of GHG allowances on the European market,
in Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of 6 October 2015, the European Parliament
and the Council decided to create a market “stability reserve” that makes it
possible to remove surplus allowances from the market. This mechanism will
enter into force on 1 January 2019. This decision is an initial step towards
an in-depth reform of the ETS that was announced as part of the “2030
Energy and Climate Package” (see section 1.5.8.1 “Future regulations at
European level”).

GHG Reporting

Pursuant to Articles L. 229-25 and R. 229-46 et seq. of the French Environment
Code (which were respectively amended by Order no. 2015-1737 and Decree
no. 2015-1738 of 24 December 2015), companies with over 500 employees
must provide an annual report on their greenhouse gas emissions and a
summary of the actions they plan to take to reduce such emissions. Article
R. 229-46, as amended by the aforementioned Decree of 24 December 2015,
specifies that the “groups defined in Article L. 2331-1 of the French Labour
Code may draw up a consolidated report on greenhouse gas emissions for
all their companies that have the same level 2 nomenclature code for French
activities” and that employ more than 500 persons.

The report is disclosed to public and must be updated every four years. The
first EDF report was published in the Indicators section of the EDF annual
report in March 2012.

Failure to draw up or file the report may lead to an administrative fine, the
amount of which cannot exceed €1,500.

Energy efficiency

Energy Efficiency Directive

On 25 October 2012, the European Union adopted a Directive on energy
efficiency (2012/27/EU). The purpose of this Directive, for which the
transposition deadline was 5 June 2014, is to enable the European Union
to reach its energy savings target of 20% by 2020. With this aim in mind,
the Directive enhances the provisions of European legislation on energy
efficiency services (no. 2006/32/EC) and cogeneration (no. 2004/8/EC).

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

The Directive of 25 October 2012 contains several provisions that are liable
to impact the activities of the EDF group, first and foremost of which is the
obligation for Member States to reach an energy savings target each year that
is equivalent to an aggregate annual reduction in energy sales of 1.5% over
the period 2014-2020, which can take the form of an obligation for energy
distributors and/or suppliers to reduce sales. The Directive also contains
provisions on providing customers with information on their consumption,
the promotion of energy services, taking into account energy efficiency in
heat and cold production, and in the transmission and distribution of energy.

Articles L. 233-1 et seq. of the French Energy Code (derived from Law
no. 2013-619 of 16 July 2013, which transposed Article 8-4 of the Directive
into French law), require large undertakings to perform an energy audit on
their business activities in France by 5 December 2015 at the latest, then
every four years. The thresholds above which undertakings are concerned,
the scope of the audit and the conditions to be met by the energy auditors
are laid down in Articles R. 233-1 and R. 233-2 and D. 233-3 to D. 233-9
of the French Energy Code, completed by the Order of 24 November 2014
on the terms of application of the energy audit. Undertakings that use a
certified energy management system that is ISO 50001 compliant may,
under certain conditions, be exempted from this obligation. In accordance
with the regulations, on 4 December 2015, EDF sent the summary of its
audit report to the lle de France Prefect.

Energy savings certificates

At national level, the energy savings certificates (CEE) mechanism, which is
provided for in Articles L. 221-1 et seq. of the French Energy Code, places
energy suppliers under the obligation to save energy. This mechanism defines
a three-year objective that is shared between persons subject to an obligation
to achieve energy savings (the “obligors”) based on their sales volumes. At
the end of the relevant period and under penalty of sanctions, the obligors
must produce energy savings certificates that correspond to the amount
of the energy savings they are under the obligation to achieve, which are
obtained either by carrying out (directly or indirectly) energy savings actions
or by purchasing credits from the other “eligible” economic players through
a national register of Certificates.

For the second period of the mechanism, between 1 January 2011 and
31 December 2013, the stated total savings target was 345TWhc (compared
to 54TWhc for the first period). In order to ensure the continuity of the
mechanism, and until the third period starts, the second period has been
extended by one year, from 1 January to 31 December 2014, by a Decree
of 20 December 2013.

The third period started on 1 January 2015 and will end on 31 December
2017. The energy savings target for the third period is set at 700TWhc (i.e.
233.4TWhc/year). Decree no. 2014-1668 of 29 December 2014 (now Articles
R. 221-1 et seq. of the French Energy Code) and several implementing orders
that were published in December 2014 determine the conditions and terms
for the issuance of CEE for this new period.

The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth
amended the CEE system for the third period, by adding an additional
system to the obligation that was already provided for, concerning the
energy savings made for the benefit of households that are in a precarious
situation in terms of energy. Decree no. 2015-1825 of 30 December 2015
(now Articles R. 221-1 et seq. of the French Energy Code) and several
ministerial orders of the same date have clarified the rules on meeting the
energy savings objectives that are specifically for the benefit of households
that are in a precarious situation in terms of energy. The level of this specific
obligation for energy suppliers is set at 150TWhc for 2016-2017.

Moreover, the Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for
Green Growth provides for a fourth period between 1 January 2018 and
31 December 2020. An order will specify the amount of the energy savings
obligation for this next period.

Registered natural sites and classified sites (buried lines)

The EDF Group is also subject to regulations on classified and registered
sites that are stipulated in Articles L. 341-1 to L. 341-22 and R. 341-1 to
R. 341-31 of the French Environment Code.

The aim of these regulations is to preserve natural heritage sites and sites
for which the conservation, from a landscape, artistic, historical, scientific,
folkloric or scenic standpoint, is in the public interest. “Classification”,
which is reserved for the most singular sites, provides extensive protection,
whereas “registration”, for which the framework of rules is less restrictive,
is proposed for less sensitive sites.

Under the French Environment Code, new electricity lines on classified sites
must be buried. Registration and classification can also have an impact on
the day-to-day operation of facilities (if more than one site is visible at the
same time; obligation to obtain the opinion of the State architect — architecte
des Batiments de France, etc.).

Protection of the environment through criminal law

Directive no. 2008/99/EC of 19 November 2008 on the protection of the
environment through criminal law, the main purpose of which is to identify
conduct that leads to serious environmental damage that must be punished
by all Member States, was at the origin of French Order no. 2012-34 of
11 January 2012, which harmonised the criminal penalties laid down in the
French Environment Code.

Health, hygiene and safety regulations

Asbestos

In France, the regulations require, among other things, the identification
of materials containing asbestos in buildings and, if necessary, monitoring
procedures or asbestos removal work. EDF is also subject to regulatory
obligations to inform and protect workers who may be exposed to asbestos
dust inhalation.

Legionella

EDF operates air cooling towers that are needed, in particular, for its
electricity generation business, which are now subject to ICPE Regulations
on basic nuclear facilities (BNF). EDF must, among other obligations, carry
out a methodical analysis of the risk of proliferation of legionella in its air
cooling towers and implement a preventive maintenance plan for cleaning
and disinfection. EDF is also required to carry out analyses once or twice a
month, depending on the type of facility involved.

Nanoparticle substances

As from 1 January 2013, Articles L. 523-1 et seq. and R. 523-12 et seq. of
the French Environment Code made it mandatory to report the quantities
and uses of nanoparticle substances or nanomaterials produced, distributed
or imported in France. Information on these substances must be made
available to the public and to inspection authorities. The information to
be declared and the rules governing the declaration were specified in an
Order of 6 August 2012. EDF is likely to be concerned by these provisions
as it uses nanoparticle substances.

Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)

Pursuant to the Grenelle 2 Law, Decree no. 2011-1697 of 1 December
2011 requires managers of public electricity transmission networks to
perform regular verifications of the EMF caused by electric lines that
transmit electricity.


--- Page 76 ---

Law no. 2015-136 of 9 February 2015 on sobriety, transparency, information
and consultation regarding electromagnetic wave exposure introduced an
obligation to provide information for persons who install equipment that
emits electromagnetic fields on residential premises. In due course, this
obligation may concern some entities of the EDF group.

Chemical products

Regulation (EC) no. 1907/2006 on the registration, evaluation and
authorisation of chemicals, known as “REACH”, which came into force
on 1 June 2007, applies to EDF as a user, but also as a manufacturer and
importer of chemical products. EDF has complied with its obligation to
register substances that it manufactures or imports in quantities of more than
1,000 tonnes per year with the European Chemicals Agency. In May 2013,
EDF registered the monochloramine that is manufactured in situ at certain
nuclear plants.

In addition, the Biocides Regulation (EU) no. 528/2012 of 22 May 2012
provides for a new procedure, with an extended scope of application,
of authorisations for placing on the market of biocidal products that are
generated in situ. In this new regulatory environment, EDF is concerned
as a manufacturer and user of monochloramine and sodium hypochlorite.
Applications for authorisation will be prepared and filed within the framework
of this Biocides Regulation.

Health and the environment

Law no. 2013-316 of 16 April 2013 on the independence of expertise in
the area of health, the environment and the protection of whistleblowers
confirmed the recognition of an alert procedure in the area of public health
and the environment within businesses and laid down the rules for using
this procedure. This Law also organises a system to protect whistleblowers
and set up the National Commission for Ethics and Public Health and
Environment Alerts (CNDASE). Several decrees have specified the rules for
the implementation of this system (Decree no. 2014-324 of 11 March 2014,
Decree no. 2014-1629 and Decree no. 2014-1628 of 26 December 2014).

1.5.6.2 Regulations applicable to EDF group
fa s and acti

1.5.6.2.1 Regulations applicable to facilities classified
for the protection of the environment (ICPEs)

Facilities concerned and main obligations

Certain facilities operated in France by the EDF Group, in particular thermal
power plants, are subject to legislation on facilities that are classified for
the protection of the environment (ICPEs), which is organised in the French
Environment Code. These facilities are subject to a prior declaration,
simplified authorisation (known as “registration”) or to an authorisation
depending on the magnitude of danger or adverse effects they may cause
to the environment or public health.

The ICPE Regulation requires that the site be restored when a facility is taken
out of service, depending on the expected future use of the land. Under
Article L. 516-1 of the French Environment Code, lodging financial guarantees
is also required for certain ICPE facilities that are subject to authorisation
(including Seveso facilities) and registration. The basis and amount of the
financial guarantees vary depending on the facility. The financial guarantees
are designed to provide collateral for the financing of the measures that
must be adopted in the event of an accident before or after closure, as well
as the surveillance, safety works and restoration operations after closure.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

These guarantees do not cover compensation owed by the operator to third
parties who may suffer damages in connection with the activity carried out.

The list of the ICPEs concerned by the obligation to lodge these guarantees
and the rules for calculating and lodging the financial guarantees are
stipulated by the Order of 31 May (that was amended by an Order of
12 February 2015) and the Order of 31 July 2012. An Order of 5 February
2014 provides the framework for lodging guarantees via the intermediary
of a private guarantee fund. The EDF Group operates facilities that are
concerned by these new requirements. Decree no. 2015-1250 of 7 October
2015 increased the threshold above which guarantees are required from
€75,000 to €100,000 (Article R. 516-1 of the French Environment Code).
It also provides for additional financial guarantees to be lodged with the
Caisse des dépéts et consignations, as well as the amendment of the rules
governing how guarantees are triggered, in particular by allowing them to be
implemented as soon as court-ordered liquidation proceedings are initiated.

Seveso facilities

Since 1 June 2015, “Seveso” ICPEs have been governed by the provisions
of the Seveso 3 Directive (2012/18 of 4 July 2012), which replaced the
Seveso 2 Directive (96/82/EC). The entry into force of the Seveso 3 Directive
resulted in the use of dangerous products (under the CLP Regulation of
16 December 2008) that were not covered by the Seveso 2 Directive being
incorporated into the scope of the Seveso regulations.

The Seveso 3 Directive also contains stricter provisions concerning access
by the public to information related to safety, public participation in the
decision-making process and access to justice, as well as improvements in
the way information is collected, managed, made available and shared. The
Seveso 3 Directive also introduced stricter standards for facility inspections.
Law no. 2013-619 of 16 July 2013 transposed the legislative portion of the
directive into French law by inserting into the Environment Code (Articles
L. 515-15 et seq.) a section that is specific to Seveso facilities. These
provisions, which are complemented by two Decrees (no. 2014-285 and
no. 2014-284) of 3 March 2014 and by an Order of 26 May 2014, entered
into force on 1 June 2015.

Decree no. 2015-1250 of 7 October 2015 amended the rules governing how
the financial guarantees that are applicable to Seveso ICPEs are lodged, in
particular by allowing operators of multiple facilities to pool these guarantees.
A forthcoming order will specify the rules for lodging these guarantees, as
well as the methodology for calculating pooled guarantees.

Facilities that are subject to the IED Directive

Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (known
as the “IED” Directive) revised and recast several existing Directives into a
single piece of legislation, including the IPPC, LCP, Waste Incineration and
VOC Directives, among others.

Chapter Ill of this Directive affects EDF as it regulates the combustion
plants that are found in fossil fuel-fired plants, in particular. The applicable
requirement levels depend on the nominal thermal power of the combustion
plants concerned and on the fuel used. This Directive, which was partially
transposed into French law by Order no. 2012-7 of 5 January 2012 (and
incorporated into the French Environment Code in Articles L. 515-28
to L. 515-31), has the effect of broadening the application of the IPPC
Directive to include new activities, enhancing the scope of the best available
techniques (BAT) on which the fixed emission limit values will be based,
causing a periodic reconsideration of operating conditions in order to take
into account changes in BAT and, in certain cases, requiring a “baseline
report” on the state of soil.

Decree no. 2013-5 of 2 January 2013 partially transposed the provisions
of the IED Directive on the state of soil. Article 1 of the decree, which is
now Article R. 512-4 of the French Environment Code, states that interim
analysis of the soil will now be required in the event of a substantive change

of the facility and, if pollution occurs, the operator must propose measures.
Another Decree no. 2013-374 of 2 May 2013 completed this transposition
by introducing provisions into Articles R. 515-58 to R. 515-84 of the French
Environment Code that are specific to facilities that are covered by the IED
Directive. These provisions apply to thermal plants, under the conditions
laid down, in particular, by the Order of 26 August 2013 on combustion
plants with power of 2OMW or more.

ns applicable to basic

In France, EDF is, in particular, subject to Law no. 2006-686 of 13 June 2006
on transparency and safety in the nuclear field (the “TSN Law”), which
was integrated into the French Environment Code via its implementing
Decree no. 2007-1557 of 2 November 2007, as amended, and the Order
of 7 February 2012, as amended, which laid down the general rules for
basic nuclear facilities (the “BNF Order”). This legislation establishes the
legal rules that are applicable to Basic Nuclear Facilities (BNF). The Law was
amended by Order no. 2016-128 of 10 February 2016 that contains various
provisions on nuclear matters and which, in particular, transposed into
French law Council Directive no. 2014/87/Euratom of 8 July 2014 amending
Directive no. 2009/71/Euratom establishing a Community framework for
the nuclear safety of nuclear installations and Directive no. 2011/70 of
19 July 2011 establishing a Community framework for the responsible and
safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. It will also concern
the NSA‘s powers of sanction.

The TSN Law created the Nuclear Safety Authority (NSA), an independent
government agency, with the Ministers for Nuclear Safety retaining authority
to issue the main authorisations and draft general regulations.

The construction of a BNF is authorised, following a public enquiry, by
a decree, after consulting the NSA and on the basis of a report by the
Ministers for Nuclear Safety. The decree that authorises the construction must
state the identity of the operator, the nature of the facilities, its maximum
capacity and its perimeter. The application for authorisation to set up a
BNF must include, in particular, a preliminary security report (PSR), a study
of the impact of the facility on the environment and health, a dismantling
plan and a risk management study (RMS). The decree that authorises the
construction of the BNF sets a time limit to commission the facility and
the frequency of safety inspections if not equal to 10 years and, finally,
lays down requirements to ensure the public safety, health and sanitation,
and the protection of nature and the environment. The authorisation to
commission the BNF (i.e. load the fuel into the reactor core) is issued by the
NSA after consulting the public. In this respect, the operator provides the
updated safety rule set and an internal emergency plan (IEP) that specifies
the organisational measures, intervention methods and requisite resources
that are implemented by the operator in the event of an emergency. An
additional safety inspection assesses the compliance of the facility with the
applicable regulations and updates the assessment of the risks that the
facility poses to the interests mentioned above.

Pursuant to the decree that authorises the facility to be set up, the
conditions applicable to pumping water, discharging liquid and gaseous
wastes — whether radioactive or not — as well as the related limits placed
on these activities are set by an NSA decision; decisions that set the limits
for discharges by facilities into the environment require approval.

The NSA also issues regulations pursuant to the decree that authorises the
facility to be set up, in order to prevent or limit the effects of any accidents
or incidents, to define measures to protect residents on an individual and
collective basis, limit noise pollution and manage the waste generated by
and stored at the facilities.

Rules on the safety and inspection of nuclear facilities

The nuclear facilities operated by EDF are subject to the general regulations
on basic nuclear facilities derived from the French Environment Code. Priority
must be given to the protection of the interests mentioned by the law
(public safety, health and sanitation, nature and the environment) via the

88 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

prevention of accidents and the limitation of their consequences in respect
of nuclear safety, as specified by the BNF Order. In this respect, nuclear
safety is defined as a set of technical provisions and organisational measures
concerning the design, the construction, the operation, the shutdown and
the decommissioning of BNF, as well as the transportation of radioactive
substances, which are adopted with a view to preventing accidents or
limiting the effects thereof.

The NSA also has the authority to issue regulatory decisions of a technical
nature to complete the terms and conditions for application of the decrees
and orders issued in the field of nuclear safety and radiation protection, with
‘the exception of those related to occupational healthcare. These decisions are
subject to the approval of the relevant ministers. Since the aforementioned
BNF Order was published, out of the twenty or so decisions that are being
prepared, nine have been published and approved.

The provisions of the French Environment Code concerning BNF also set up
mechanisms for informing the authorities. In this respect, all accidents and
incidents, whether nuclear or otherwise, that have or may have particular
consequences for the security of a BNF, must be declared without delay
by the operator, in particular to the NSA and to the State’s representative
in the département where the incident or accident took place. Moreover,
the TSN Law created or improved tools used to inform the public, with, for
example, the creation of a High Committee for transparency and information
on nuclear safety or the possibility given to any person to ask the operator
directly for information on the risks involved in exposure to ionising radiation
and on the safety and radiation protection measures adopted to prevent or
reduce these exposure risks.

Moreover, increasingly strict administrative and criminal law penalties have
been established to punish BNF operators who do not comply with their
legal and regulatory obligations, such as a three-year prison sentence and
a €150,000 fine if a BNF is operated without authorisation, or a one-year
prison sentence and a €30,000 fine if radioactive substances are transported
without authorisation or approval.

In July 2014, the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted
Council Directive no. 2014/87/Euratom of 8 July 2014 amending Directive
no. 2009/7 1/Euratom establishing a community framework for the nuclear
safety of nuclear installations (see section 1.5.8.1 “Future regulations at
European level”).

The legal framework described above for safety and inspection was
completed by certain provisions of the Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy
Transition for Green Growth and Order no. 2016-128 of 10 February 2016
that contains various provisions on nuclear matters.

In particular, the role of the local information commissions (CLIs) was
reinforced: they can review all matters that fall within the scope of their
remits of their own motion, they must be consulted if the specific intervention
plan is amended and can inspect BNF at the request of the chair of the CLI
in the case of an event rated 1 or higher on the International Nuclear and
Radiological Event Scale, etc. Moreover, the NSA‘s power of sanction was
enhanced with, in particular, the creation within the NSA of a Sanctions
Committee composed of Council of State and Supreme Court judges.

ies

Decommissioning of nuclear facil

The decommissioning of a BNF is authorised by a Prime Minister’s decree
that is issued after a public enquiry and after an opinion by the NSA.
This decree specifies the stages of the decommissioning, how long it will
last and the intended final status. Once the decommissioning has been
completed, the operator must send the NSA a declassification request,
which, following an approval decision by the NSA, makes it possible to end
the BNF status of the facility. The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy
Transition for Green Growth, in particular its provision that is now Article
L. 593-25 of the French Environment Code, gave legislative value to the
decommissioning strategy implemented since the early 2000s by EDF in
stating that decommissioning must take place within a timeframe that
is “as short as possible” after final shutdown, under conditions that are
economically acceptable and in compliance with the principles set forth in
Article L. 1333-2 of the French Public Health Code and Section II of Article
L. 110-1 of the French Environment Code.


--- Page 78 ---

A draft decree on the decommissioning of basic nuclear facilities will amend
the Decree of 2 November 2007, known as the “Procedures Decree”, with
a view to implementing the provisions derived from the Law on the Energy
Transition for Green Growth, in particular the content of the shutdown
declaration and decommissioning application files.

Radioactive waste

EDF's business is subject to French regulations on the sustainable
management of radioactive waste. EDF bears liability for the radioactive waste
resulting from its operations. In France, radioactive waste is managed by
the National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management (ANDRA), a public
institution of industrial and commercial nature created by Law no. 91-1381 of
30 December 1991 on research into the management of radioactive waste.

The method used to manage radioactive waste in France depends on the level
of radioactivity and radioactivity lifespan of the waste (see section 1.4.1.1.4
“The nuclear fuel cycle and related issues”). The Law of 28 June 2006, which
is now Articles L. 542-1 et seq. of the French Environment Code, defines
the organisation and the financing of radioactive waste management,
along with the terms for a framework to evaluate and cover the costs of
decommissioning BNF, as well as managing spent fuels and radioactive
waste, is incorporated into Articles L. 594-1 et seq. In particular, the assets
allocated to cover provisions cannot be used for any other purpose by the
operator, and separate accounting procedures for these assets must be used.
The implementation of these provisions is controlled by the administrative
authority, i.e. the Minister for Energy, which is itself overseen by a National
Assessment Commission for the financing of decommissioning costs for
BNFs and the management of spent fuels and radioactive waste.

Decree no. 2007-243 of 23 February 2007 on securing the financing of costs
in the nuclear industry sets forth the terms and conditions for implementing
the Law of June 2006.

A report is filed with the administrative authorities and the NSA every three
years with a copy sent to the Statutory Auditors. This report includes, in
particular, a valuation of the costs, the methods used for the calculation
of provisions, and the composition of the assets. The administrative
authorities may require any additional supporting documents, have an
outside organisation conduct a study, or require an expert valuation of the
assets at the operator's expense.

Council Directive no. 2011/70/Euratom established a framework for the
responsible and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste for
a certain number of European Union Member States, and clarifies several
concepts. This Directive presents, in particular, deep geological disposal as
the safest and most sustainable option to manage Long-Lived, High-Level
Waste and considers the possibility of creating disposal facilities shared
between several Member States, on a voluntary basis.

Regulations on radiation protection

In France, nuclear activities that present a risk of exposing persons to ionising
radiation are regulated by two separate sets of rules, depending on the
category of persons to be protected. Regulations on the basic protection
of the population against such radiation, which are governed by the French
Public Health Code, are primarily based on all nuclear activities being subject
to a declaration or authorisation. Authorisations granted to establish a Basic
Nuclear Facility serve as the authorisation required under the French Public
Health Code. Article R. 1333-8 of the French Public Health Code sets the
maximum exposure level of the general public at 1mSv per year.

French Regulations on the protection of workers against the dangers of
ionising radiation, which are governed by the French Labour Code, lay down
various obligations for employers of workers who are likely to be exposed
and, in particular, set a limit on exposure of workers to ionising radiation
at 20mSv over a period of twelve consecutive months.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

The French Health Code contains the provisions applicable to controlling
high-level sealed radioactive sources and orphan sources.

Council Directive no. 2013/59/Euratom of 5 December 2013, which laid
down “basic safety standards”, repealed Directive no. 96/29 of 13 May
1996. This Directive must be transposed before 6 February 2018. The State
services concerned have organised working groups in which employers and
employees are represented, with a view to achieving transposition, the aim
of which is to simplify the system.

Civil liability of nuclear facility operators

Several international conventions govern the civil liability of nuclear facility
operators, in particular the Paris Convention of 29 July 1960 on Third-
Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy and the Brussels Convention
of 31 January 1963, which supplements the Paris Convention. These two.
Conventions are applicable in the signatory countries that have ratified
them, including France and the United Kingdom.

The Paris Convention established a special liability derogation system, with
specific characteristics. Liability for nuclear damage to persons and property is
objective (even in the absence of a fault) and limited in terms of the amount
and duration, and is focused on the operator of the nuclear facility only.

In France, the operator's liability was limited to approximately €91.5 million
per nuclear accident at a facility and to approximately €22.9 million per
nuclear accident during transport. These amounts were respectively increased
to €700 million and €70 million on 18 February 2016 when Article 130 of
the Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth
mentioned below entered into force.

Over and above the maximum amount for which the operator is liable, the
State where the incident occurred is responsible for compensating victims up
to a maximum of €201.4 million (provided that said State is a Contracting
State of the Brussels Convention); over and above this amount, Member
States that have ratified the Brussels Convention (including France) contribute
collectively to compensation up to a limit of €345.3 million.

The Convention also provides that the operator has an obligation to take out
insurance or lodge a financial guarantee for the liability amounts established
in order to guarantee the availability of funds. The Minister for the Economy
monitors French operators’ compliance with this obligation. EDF complies
with the current coverage requirements (see section 2.2.7 “Insurance”).

Protocols to amend the Paris and Brussels Conventions were signed
on 12 February 2004 but have not yet entered into force. They require
significantly higher amounts of compensation to be available in order to
cover a greater number of victims and types of damage that are eligible for
indemnification. The operator's liability will thus be at least €700 million
per nuclear incident in a facility and €70 million per nuclear incident during
transport. The State in which the nuclear facility of the operator that is
liable for causing the damages is located is liable for amounts above the
€700 million for which the operator is liable, up to €1,200 million (provided
that said State is a Contracting State of the Brussels Convention). Over and
above this amount, the Contracting States of the Brussels Convention are
liable up to a maximum amount of €1,500 million. In addition, for personal
injury only, the time limit to claim compensation has changed from 10 years
to 30 years from the date of the incident. Another important change is the
introduction of a detailed definition of “nuclear damage”, which includes
non material damage, the cost of preventive measures, the cost of measures
to rehabilitate damaged environments, and certain other harms resulting
from damage to the environment. These new provisions will, however,
only be applicable when the protocol that amends the Paris Convention
comes into force, i.e. when at least two-thirds of the sixteen Contracting
States have ratified it. France has adopted a law permitting ratification of
both Protocols (Law no. 2006-786 of 5 July 2006), but has not yet filed the
corresponding ratification instruments.

Moreover, on 30 April 2014, France filed its ratification instrument for the
joint protocol relating to the application of the Vienna Convention and
the Paris Convention, which thus entered into force for France on 30 July
2014. This joint protocol establishes a link between the Paris Convention,
which covers countries in Western Europe, and the Vienna Convention of
21 May 1963 on civil liability for nuclear damage, which covers (among
others) countries in Eastern Europe. It enables the parties to one of these
two conventions (Paris or Vienna) who adhere to the protocol to benefit
from the coverage provided by the other convention.

Protection of nuclear facilities and material

The purpose of the regulations on the protection and control of nuclear
material governed by Article L. 1333-1 of the French Defence Code is to
detect and prevent the loss, theft or misappropriation of nuclear material
that is stored at facilities or being transported, or any attempts to alter,
damage or disperse such material.

These regulations were completely recast by Decree no. 2009-1120 of
17 September 2009 on the protection and control of nuclear material, its
facilities and its transportation, as set forth in the French Defence Code.
The main purpose of this decree was to extend the protection of nuclear
material to the facilities where it is stored. Several orders published in 2011
detail operators’ obligations.

For nuclear power plants, the Order of 10 June 2011 on the physical
protection of facilities that house nuclear materials, which can only be held
with an authorisation, is based on in-depth defence of targets, namely the
nuclear material, equipment or functions, which, in the event of default or
damage by a malicious act, are liable to have radiological consequences.
Accordingly, the operator must set up several lines of protection in the form
of six zones (e.g. access control areas, a vital area, an internal area, etc.).
Following an amendment by an Order of 15 September 2015, itnow makes
it possible to set up safety devices in dangerous areas if the assessment of
the contents of the safety study provided for in Article R. 1333-4 of the
French Defence Code reveal that the means implemented to meet the safety
objectives appear to be insufficient.

The Order of 9 June 2011 organises the system for physically monitoring
nuclear material, as well as the accounting conditions for nuclear material
and operator obligations. Accordingly, operators must ensure that the
physical monitoring and accounting are protected against the malicious
actions identified when the authorisation is issued.

Law no. 2015-588 of 2 June 2015 on the improvement of the protection
of civilian facilities that house nuclear materials created a specific criminal
misdemeanour of trespassing in these facilities. For the implementation of
these rules, Decree no. 2015-1255 of 8 October 2015 created Restricted
Access Nuclear Areas (ZNAR) that must be delineated within each facility.
Trespassing in a ZNAR constitutes a criminal misdemeanour that carries a
one-year prison sentence and a €15,000 fine. These penalties are increased
in the event of aggravating circumstances (to a three-year prison sentence
and a €45,000 fine, in particular when the offence is committed in a group,
and to a seven-year prison sentence and a €100,000 fine, in particular if the
offence is committed with the use or threat of a weapon).

1.5.6.2.3 Regulations applicable to fossil fuel-fired

energy generation

The EDF Group‘s thermal energy generation business is subject in France
to the regulations that are applicable to ICPEs (see section 1.5.6.2.1
“Regulations applicable to facilities classified for the protection of the
environment (ICPEs)”). EDF's thermal facilities must also comply with specific
regulations on air quality, adopted mainly as a result of European Directive
no. 2001/81/EC of 23 October 2001 on national emission ceilings for certain
atmospheric pollutants (the NEC Directive), and Directive no. 2001/80/EC

90 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants
into the air from large combustion plants (the LCP Directive), which, since
1 January 2016, has been repealed and replaced by Directive no. 2010/75/EU
of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (the IED Directive). These
directives have been transposed into French law by several orders, in particular
the Order of 30 July 2003 on boilers that are present in existing combustion
facilities with a power rating of more than Z20MWth, which, since 1 January
2016, has been repealed and replaced by the Order of 26 August 2013
on combustion facilities with a power rating of ZO0MW or more, which are
subject to authorisation under section 2910 and section 2931.

Exemptions from obligations concerning emissions into the air were possible
until 31 December 2015. As of that time, the ceilings and the exemptions
originating from the IED Directive mentioned above will apply, with, in
particular, specific issues concerning production facilities in the overseas
departments and emergency systems, for which the pollution levels require
negotiating adapted provisions. Two orders of 26 August 2013, which
entered into force on 1 January 2014, bring together all the provisions that
are applicable to combustion facilities and specify the conditions under which
these facilities will be allowed to exceed emissions limits.

Thermal energy production is also subject to the provisions of the
Seveso 3 Directive and to the obligation to lodge financial guarantees
(see section 1.5.6.2.1 “Regulations applicable to facilities classified for
the protection of the environment (ICPEs)"). Decree no. 2014-1501 of
12 December 2014, which amended the nomenclature for classified facilities,
concerns certain thermal facilities that store heavy fuel, and makes them
subject to the Seveso 2 Directive.

Directive no. 2015/2193/EU of 25 November 2015 on the limitation of
emissions of certain pollutants into the air from medium combustion plants
must be transposed into French law by 19 December 2017. It lays down
rules designed to limit the air pollution caused by sulphur dioxide (SO,),
nitrogen oxides (NO,) and dust from medium combustion plants, and to
reduce the airborne emissions and their potential risks for human and
environmental health. The facilities concerned are combustion plants with
a rated thermal input of 1MW or more and less than SOMW, regardless of
the type of fuel they use.

1.5.6.2.4 Regula
facilities

In France, hydropower facilities are subject to the provisions contained in
Articles L. 511-1 et seq. of the French Energy Code. They require concession
agreements granted by decree (for facilities generating over 100MW) or by
order of the Prefect (for facilities generating between 4.5MW and 100MW),
or an authorisation from the Prefecture (for facilities under 4.5MW), (see
section 1.4.1.4.1.4 “Issues relating to hydropower generation” concerning
hydropower concessions).

EDF's hydropower generation business is subject to the substantive provisions
of water regulations. Such regulations cover in particular control over
variations in water levels and flow rates, the safety of areas in the vicinity,
downstream of hydropower facilities and, in general, maintaining balanced
management of water resources (see section 1.5.6.1 “Basic regulations
applicable to the environment, health, hygiene and safety”).

Competitive tendering for hydropower concession contracts

Until 1 April 2016, the competitive tendering procedure for hydropower
concession contracts will still be governed by Decree no. 94-894 of
13 October 1994, which has now been incorporated into Book V of the
regulatory section of the French Energy Code (cf. Decree no. 2015-1823
of 30 December 2015 on the organisation of the regulatory section of the
French Energy Code). This decree, as amended by Decree no. 2008-1009
of 26 September 2008, places concessions within the legal framework


--- Page 80 ---

for public service delegation contracts defined by Law no. 93-122 of
29 January 1993, known as the “Sapin Act”, it being specified that the
former preferential right of the outgoing operator was eliminated by the
Water Act (Law no. 2006-1772 of 30 December 2006) as it was incompatible
with European law.

For all procedures initiated as from 1 April 2016, the award of hydropower
concession contracts is now governed by Order no. 2016-65 of 29 January
2016 and by its implementing Decree no. 2016-86 of 1 February 2016 on
concession contracts. This legislation has repealed the aforementioned
provisions of the “Sapin Act”, in order to modernise them and align them
with European law (Directive no. 2014/23/EU of 26 February 2014 on the
award of concession contracts).

The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth
has completed the legal framework for hydropower concession contracts
by giving the State the possibility:

= of combining concession contracts that form a “series of facilities that
are hydraulically linked”, by setting a new deadline for all the concession
contracts concerned (Articles L. 521-16-1 and L. 521-16-2 of the French
Energy Code);

= of creating semi-public hydroelectric companies (SEM) made up of
private-sector operators and a public division (State, local authorities,
etc.), each of which holds at least 34% of the shares (Articles L. 521-18
et seq. of the French Energy Code);

= of extending certain concession contracts in return for investments by
operators where these investments are necessary in order to reach national
energy policy targets (Article L. 521-16-3 of the French Energy Code).

A draft decree on hydropower concession contracts, the purpose of which is
to implement the provisions of the aforementioned Law of 17 August 2015,
and to modernise the regulatory framework for hydropower concession
contracts (in particular by clarifying certain aspects of the procedure for
awarding hydropower concession contracts by approving a new model for
general terms and conditions), was submitted to the CSE for an opinion on
20 October 2015. As soon as this decree is enacted, probably in the first
semester of 2016, it will incorporate, by way of amendment, Book V of
the regulatory section of the French Energy Code, which now contains the
provisions of the aforementioned Decree of 13 October 1994.

Moreover, other pieces of draft legislation on hydropower concession
contracts are expected to be adopted in the near future, in particular a draft
order that will be enacted pursuant to powers granted to the Government
by Article 119 of the Law of 17 August 2015, which was submitted to the
CSE on 12 October 2015, which, in particular, amends the rules on the
administrative and criminal penalties that are applicable to hydropower
concession contracts.

Annual concession fee

In accordance with Article L. 523-2 of the French Energy Code, when a
hydropower concession contract is renewed or extended under the conditions
provided for by Articles L.521-16-2 or L. 521-16-3 of the French Energy Code,
an annual concession fee that is proportional to the revenues generated by
the concession contract is levied, which is paid in part to the French State
and in part to the French départements and municipalities through which
the waterways used flow. A limit is set by the contracting authority on a
case-by-case basis for each new or renewed concession contract. Article 69
of Law no. 2015-1785 of 29 December 2015 (the Budget Act for 2016)
expressly confirmed that this type of concession fee excludes the application
of the concession fees provided for by Article L. 523-1 of said Code, which
apply to concession contracts that were renewed before 2006.

Safety and security of fat S

Articles R. 214-112 et seq. of the French Environment Code contain provisions
that are applicable to the safety and security of hydropower facilities that
are authorised, declared and operated under concession contracts. Dams
are divided into three classes (A, B and C) according to their characteristics,
in particular their height and the volume of the floodwaters. According to

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

this classification and the legal rules applicable to the facility, the regulations
require the operator or concession contract holder to fulfil a certain number of
obligations in order to guarantee the safety and security thereof (in particular
by carrying out and updating hazard studies — see section 1.4.1.4.1.2
“Hydropower safety”). The aforementioned draft decree, on hydropower
energy concession contracts, contains provisions that are designed to unify
the regulations, regardless of the legal rules that are applicable to the facility.

1.5.6.2.5 Regulations applicable to renewable energy
generation

The “Climate Package” (known as the “2020 Energy-Climate Package”)
is the source of a set of measures aimed at ensuring that, by 2020, the EU
will achieve the objectives of a 20% reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, a 20% improvement in energy efficiency and a 20% portion of
renewable energy (REN) in energy consumption. The “2020 Energy-Climate
Package”, which was adopted on 24 October 2014, set new targets for 2030:
a 40% reduction in GHG emissions compared to 1990, 27% of renewable
energies in the energy mix and a 27% improvement in energy savings.

One of the five instruments that make up the “2030 Energy-Climate
Package” is Directive no. 2009/28/EC of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of
the use of energy from renewable sources, known as the “REN” Directive.
It allocates the effort to reach the target of 20% of renewable energies in
final EU energy consumption by 2020 among Member States, taking into
account, among other aspects, the national energy mix, the potential of
each State and their GDP, and requires Member States to adopt national
renewable energy action plans.

According to Article 4 of the aforementioned REN Directive, France adopted
its National Action Plan in favour of renewable energies (2009-2020). This
plan, in accordance with the REN Directive, sets a national target of a 23%
share of energy from renewable sources in the gross final consumption of
energy by 2020. The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for
Green Growth also provides for a target of 32% of renewable energies in
energy consumption by 2030. Moreover, the same law provides that the
national plan will be replaced by the part of the PPE that concerns the
development of renewable energies and energy recovery.

In order to achieve the objectives of the REN Directive, the Grenelle 2 Law
created new land planning instruments with a view to enabling balanced
development between the various renewable energy sectors, which include:

® regional climate, air and energy schemes (SRCAEs), for which the legal
framework is laid down in Articles L. 222-1 to L. 222-3 and R. 222-1 to
R. 222-7 of the French Environment Code. As of 1 May 2014, all regions
had adopted their SRCAE;

™ regional schemes for connection to renewable energy networks (S3RERs),
of which Articles D. 321-10 to D. 321-21 and D. 342-22 to D. 342-25
of the French Energy Code specify the content, approval rules, host
capacity management and financial conditions for the connection of
electricity producers.

Under Article 15 of the REN Directive, an Order of 14 September 2011
(ratified by Law no. 2013-619 of 16 July 2013) amended the legal rules on
the guarantees of origin of the electricity produced using renewable sources
or by cogeneration, laid down in Articles L. 314-14 et seq. of the French
Energy Code. The terms and conditions to implement this new scheme and
the rules for appointing the organisation in charge of managing guarantees
of origin (issuing, transfer, cancellation) are stipulated in Articles R. 314-24
to R. 314-41 of the French Energy Code. As producer and mandatory
purchaser of electricity produced using renewable energy sources, the EDF
Group is concerned by these provisions.

The Grenelle 2 Law also contains exceptional provisions designed to
encourage the development of sea-based energies, which were enhanced
by the Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth.

In addition, Article 18 of Law no. 2014-1545 of 20 December 2014 on
the simplification of corporate life empowers the Government to set up.
a dedicated, comprehensive authorisation system for sea-based facilities

that produce renewable energy and that are located in the maritime public
domain, and for the connection structures for these facilities. Moreover,
Decree no. 2016-9 of 8 January 2016 simplified the legal procedures that
are applicable to sea-based renewable energy projects that win competitive
tendering procedures.

Furthermore, the Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green
Growth provides an exceptional appeal timeframe for the benefit of “facilities
that produce energy from renewable sources” of four months in which to
contest an authorisation, as from, respectively, either the publication of the
authorisation, or its notification.

1.5.6.2.6 Regulations applicable to the generation
of wind power

Pursuant to Articles R. 421-1 and R. 421-2 of the French Urban Planning
Code, a building permit must be obtained for land-based wind farms with
a height equal to or greater than 12 metres. The construction of wind
farms on the public maritime domain is exempted from the requirement
for a building permit, in accordance with Article R. 421-8-1 of the French
Urban Planning Code.

In addition, the Grenelle 2 Law provides that land-based wind farms are now
subject to the nomenclature applicable to ICPEs with the legal system of
authorisation or declaration (see section 1.5.6.2.1 “Regulations applicable
to facilities classified for the protection of the environment (ICPEs)") under
section 2980 “Terrestrial facilities for the generation of electricity using
mechanical wind energy with one or more wind-power generators”. In
connection with the application for a building permit, an impact study
must be performed for wind farms that are subject to authorisation and
submitted with the building permit file.

The Law of 17 August 2015 on the Energy Transition for Green Growth
amended the rules on the distance required between wind farms and
housing: the minimum distance of 500 metres is maintained, but may be
increased in light of the impact study, which is part of the authorisation
application. It also inserted provisions into Article L. 146-4.1 of the French
Urban Planning Code that are designed to facilitate the location of land-
based wind farms in municipalities concerned by the “Coastline” Law.
A decree is also expected to clarify the rules on wind farm location with
regard to military facilities and sectors, weather monitoring equipment and
air navigation equipment.

The operator of a wind farm, or in the event of default, the parent company,
is responsible for decommissioning the farm and site restoration, as soon
as operation is terminated for any reason (Articles L. 553-3 and R. 553-1 of
the French Environment Code). For this purpose, the operator is required
to lodge financial guarantees as of the start-up of generation and for
subsequent accounting periods.

1.5.6.2.7 Regulations applicable to public markets

The Directive no. 2014/24/EU on procurement and Directive no. 2014/25/EU
on procurement by entities operating in water, energy, transport and
postal services sectors, in which EDF is submitted as a marketer, have been
transposed in national law by:

m= Order no. 2015-899 of 23 July 2015 on public markets which proceed
to an union of the different competitive procedures present so far in
‘the Code des Marches Publics and Order no. 2005-649 of 6 June 2005;

m Decree no. 2016-260 of 25 March 2016 related to the Order of 23 July
2015.

These texts entered into force on 1 April 2016.

92 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

1.5.7 REGULATIONS ON THE WHOLESALE
ENERGY MARKETS

Inspired by the rules contained in Directive no. 2003/6/EC on market abuse
applicable to financial markets (see section 4.1 “Corporate Governance
Code”), Regulation (EU) no. 1227/2011, known as the “REMIT” Regulation
on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency came into force on
28 December 2011. This Regulation is aimed at preventing market abuse
and manipulation on wholesale energy markets and strengthening the
confidence of market participants and consumers.

Strengthening wholesale energy market integrity and transparency must
foster open and fair competition on these markets, in particular so that
prices set on these markets reflect a fair and competitive interplay between
supply and demand. The Regulation prohibits insider trading and market
manipulation, and establishes an obligation to publish inside information
as defined in the REMIT.

The European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) is
primarily responsible for monitoring wholesale trades in energy products,
in order to detect and prevent transactions based on inside information
and market manipulations.

ACER also collects the data needed to assess and monitor markets, inasmuch
as the regulation provides that market participants, or a person empowered
to do so on their behalf, must supply ACER with a detailed statement of
wholesale energy market transactions.

Lastly, market participants that perform transactions for which a declaration
to ACER is mandatory must register with the national regulatory authority
of the Member State in which they are established (the CRE in France) or,
if they are not established in the European Union, that of a Member State
in which they do business.

1.5.8 PRINCIPAL PLANNED REGULATIONS
THAT ARE LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT
ON THE EDF GROUP’S BUSINESS

Several planned regulations, both at community level and in France, could
have a significant impact on the EDF group's business. The main regulations
are described below.

1.5.8.1. Future regulations at European level

European Energy Union

On 25 February 2015, the European Commission published its strategy to
build a European Energy Union. This package “European Energy Union” calls
for several legislation amendments and is based on three communication
points concerning:

m the strategic framework for a resilient Energy Union that has a forward-
looking climate change policy;

m the programme for the fight against global climate change after 2020
as part of the Paris Protocol;

m the achievement of the target of 10% of interconnection in the electricity
sector.

There are five dimensions to the Energy Union: supply security, the internal
energy market, energy efficiency, reduction in carbon emissions, and
research and innovation in the field of energy. Each of these dimensions is
accompanied by actions that will be developed and implemented during
‘the coming years.


--- Page 82 ---

In a press release dated 10 November 2015, the European Parliament
Committee on Industry, Research and Energy presented its demands
concerning the construction of the European Energy Union.

On 18 November 2015, the European Union published a report on the
state of the Energy Union. This report describes the progress made over
the last nine months, states the key areas of action for 2016 and draws
the initial conclusions concerning the policies that must be implemented
at regional, national and European level. The report is accompanied by
twenty-eight information sheets that assess, for each Member State, the
progress of the Energy Union at national level. It also presents the roadmap
for the Energy Union.

Environment

The 2030 Energy and Climate Change Package

On 24 October 2014, the 28 Member States of the European Union reached
an agreement on their 2030 climate change and their energy objectives
and policies (known as the “2030 Energy and Climate Change Package”).
Within this timeframe, the agreement includes an objective of reducing
European Union greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% (compared to
1990), increasing the portion of the European Union‘s energy consumption
to 27% of renewable energies and improving energy efficiency by 27%.
The European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy has announced
that the 2030 Energy and Climate Change Package would be translated into
legislative proposals. Accordingly, on 15 July 2015, the European Commission
presented a draft directive designed to amend the Directive of 13 October
2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading
within the Community (the “ETS Directive"), for the period 2021-2030.
This reform is expected to be submitted to the Parliament and the Council
in the coming months.

Rules on the safety and control of nuclear facilities

In July 2014, the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted Council
Directive no. 2014/87/Euratom of 8 July 2014, which amended Directive
no. 2009/71/Euratom that established a Community framework for the
nuclear safety of nuclear facilities. The revised directive aims to update the
European framework for nuclear safety following the Fukushima accident,
in order to guarantee the uniform application of high standards for nuclear
safety and control. Member States have until 14 August 2017 to transpose
this directive into national law.

1.5.8.2 Future regulations at national level
(France)

Draft on reconquest of
and landscapes

diversity, nature

The draft bill on reconquest of biodiversity, nature and landscapes, which
was announced during the 2012 Environmental Conference, was adopted
by the French Parliament during its first reading on 24 March 2015. This
law is expected to improve protection for biodiversity and set up a French
Biodiversity Agency. It also contains the provisions of the bill on compensation
for environmental harm that the government announced in September 2013.
The law is currently being finalised by the upper and lower houses; after
being adopted by the Senate on 26 January 2016, it was adopted during
its second reading by the French Parliament on 17 March 2016.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

Reform of environmental law

Areform that aims to make the application of environmental law simpler and
more efficient has been started as part of the forum on the modernisation
of environmental law. Preparatory work on this reform is currently being
led by the Government, with the support of a specialised commission on
the modernisation of environmental law, which was set up within the
National Council for Ecological Transition (CNTE). The “Macron” Act of
6 August 2015 provides for the implementation of certain proposals that
were made during this work, via orders, which must contain measures
designed to (i) accelerate the completion of construction and development
work to facilitate energy transition, (ii) reform environmental evaluation and
transpose the provisions of Directive no. 2014/52/EU of 16 April 2014 on
impact studies and (iii) accelerate the resolution of environmental disputes.

In parallel to the General Assemblies, on 6 January 2015, the Minister for
Ecology launched the “Participative Democracy” workshop on environmental
matters that is designed to generate concrete proposals for the reform of
public participation. The proposals that are developed by this workshop were
included in the “Macron” Act, which empowers the Government to reform
the legal framework for public participation via orders. The measures to be
published are expected to enhance, in particular, this participation at the
public consultation stage, ahead of the filing of authorisation applications.

The orders provided for by the Macron Act are expected to be published
before 7 August 2016.

All of these reforms are liable to impact the authorisation procedures that
are applicable to the EDF group's projects.

Non-financial reporting

At European level, Directive no. 2014/95/EU of 22 October 2014, which
aims to improve the transparency of non-financial information between
Member States, requires large undertakings to draw up a non-financial
statement that includes information on “environmental matters, social
and employee-related matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption
and bribery matters”. It also requires these undertakings to provide a
“description of the diversity policy applied in relation to their administrative,
management and supervisory bodies”. France has until 6 December 2016
to transpose this Directive.

Draft bill on the duty of vigilance of parent
companies and prime contractor companies

This bill includes the obligation for large companies to set up a vigilance
plan and ensure its “effective” implementation, in order to identify and
prevent the materialisation of risks of infringements of human rights and
fundamental freedoms, serious bodily injury or harm to the environment
or health risks that result from their activities and those of the companies
they control, as well as the activities of their subcontractors and suppliers.
A system for verification/sanctioning by the courts of compliance with
this obligation is included in the bill. Parliament adopted the bill at its first
reading on 30 March 2015. The Senate rejected it on 18 November 2015
but it has been adopted in its second reading by the French Parliament on
23 March 2016.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES

(1.6

Research & development, patents and licenses

The main missions of the EDF Group’s Research and Development Division
(R&D) are firstly, to support the Group’s business lines and subsidiaries on
a day-to-day basis, by providing them with its top-level expertise and high-
performance practices, and secondly, to contribute to building the Group’s
future by anticipating the developments and major challenges with which
it is confronted.

In particular, these challenges include the following:

= fossil fuels and global warming, prompting reflection and regulations
on the rate of greenhouse gas emissions;

™ water uses and management of the environment;

™ the rapid development of emerging nations, and the resulting shift in
areas of consumption;

® the significant development of information technology applied to energy
sector, offering new opportunities for the electricity business;

™ customers, individual and collective consumers, who are also becoming
producers, and who want to use energy more effectively and live in more
energy self-sufficient buildings, neighbourhoods and towns.

In this context, R&D’s role is crucial when it comes to finding solutions to
all of these challenges. Its avenues of research are structured on the basis
of three broad priorities:

= consolidating and developing competitive low-carbon production mixes:
one of the key issues in transition is to ensure the effective coexistence
of conventional means of production, in particular by further improving
the safety, performance and operating lifespan of existing nuclear power
plants, alongside the development of new renewable energy;

m developing and experimenting with new energy services for clients,
enabling demand-side management that is both flexible and low-carbon,
thanks to improvements in knowledge of demand, the development
by clients of energy efficiency, the promotion of new effective uses of
electricity, often in combination with renewable energies (heat pumps,
electric mobility, etc.), the development of technical and economic
modelling to engineer buildings, industry and sustainable cities, and the
development of uses and consumption being integrated into the electricity
system itself through the use of smart grids and appropriate pricing;

™ preparing the electricity systems of the tomorrow by optimising the
lifespan of network infrastructures and accompanying adaptation of the
electricity system by improving network asset management; implementing
optimisation models and economic scenarios for new infrastructure
projects relating to energy transport; inserting intermittent energies and
developing smart grids.

In addition to its overall activity, R&D has also identified four research
programmes that fall into the “disruptive — future-ready” category. These are:

= local energy services and systems, with industrial fine-tuning of technical
resources for urban planning and definition of optimum procedures
to incorporate local energy systems within an overall national system;

@ the use of digital technology in customer relations to offer innovative
services and, within our own industry, to improve monitoring of our
installations and maintenance forecasting;

™ energy storage, photovoltaic energy and electric mobility;

= Small Modular Reactors: small reactors that could be used, in particular,
to address the market for areas that are isolated or suffer from weak
transport links.

1.6.1 R&D ORGANISATION AND KEY FIGURES

EDF's R&D is integrated and multidisciplinary in order to facilitate synergies
and method transfers between the different business lines within the Group

In 2015, the Group’s overall research and development budget amounted
to €658.9 million, €555.2 million of which was earmarked for the EDF
R&D budget. This is one of the largest R&D budgets of any major electricity
company. Approximately two-thirds of this budget is devoted to programmes
put together on a yearly basis under contractual agreements with EDF's
operational divisions and subsidiaries. The remaining third goes to medium
and long-term anticipation initiatives that fall within Group R&D priority areas.

In 2015, around 21% of this budget was devoted to protecting the
environment. In particular, expenditures covered research into energy
efficiency, uses of electricity as a substitute for fossil energy, renewable
energies and their insertion into the grid, sustainable cities, the local impacts
of climate change and other environmental issues such as biodiversity, water
quality, and the reduction of disturbances. EDF's R&D has a total staff of
over 2,100, representing 29 nationalities; 80% have manager status, 33%
are women, and 150 are Ph.D. students. 200 research lecturers teach in
universities and major engineering schools. Each year, EDF's R&D hires some
100 people, and channels others towards other entities of the Group. The
R&D Division has 15 departments. Its expertise covers the entire field of
activity of the Group: renewable energies; networks; nuclear generation,
fossil-fired, and hydro power generation; energy management; trade;
Information Systems; the environment. It is both specific to a particular
discipline, businesses, projects, as well as coming together for work on major
systems. EDF's R&D is responsible for an internal training organisation, the
Technology Transfer Institute (/nstitut de transfert de technologie, Tech),
whose purpose is to disseminate EDF R&D practice, know-how and innovation
to the rest of the EDF Group. Comprising some 100 courses, the training
catalogue is updated every year; the offer is now incorporated in the Skills
Academies (see section 3.3.1.3 “Skills development: preparing the future”)

R&D is currently organised on a multi-site basis. Three of these sites are
located in France, in the Paris region; seven are located abroad: in Germany,
the UK, Poland, China, the US, Singapore and Italy. The Chatou and Les
Renardiéres centres, near Fontainebleau both have a workforce of some
500 people. The Clamart centre has nearly 1,000 people. 230 researchers
work outside France, including thirty or so expats.

In November 2010, EDF's Board of Directors approved a new project to
relocate EDF's main R&D centre, currently located at Clamart, to the Paris-
Saclay campus. The new centre is destined to provide workspace for up to
1,500 people, including Group researchers, Ph.D. students and interns. It
is an expression of fresh ambitions on the part of EDF for its R&D, placing
scientific and industrial innovation and research at the heart of its priorities.
Anew EDF training centre will also be located nearby. Together on one site,
the new research centre and training centre will form the EDF Lab Paris-
Saclay complex. This strategic decision positions EDF as a leading player on
‘the Paris-Saclay campus, thereby enabling it to benefit from more dynamic
collaboration with the higher education establishments and public and
private-sector research centres located nearby.

In this regard, a new agreement came into force on 1 July 2014, following
signing by EDF’s R&D Division and all the trade union organisations
representing R&D. This agreement, reached as a result of sustained social
dialoque between the stakeholders defines the measures taken to support
EDF Clamart employees as they move into the new centre in mid-2016.

In addition, a number of partnership agreements have been concluded
with other institutions present on the future Paris-Saclay University campus:

= SEIDO, ajoint laboratory between EDF and Telecom Paris Tech dedicated
to the Internet of things and cybersecurity for electricity systems. Its
mission is to prepare and facilitate the deployment of energy demand
management and energy efficiency services, making use of interoperable,
communicating energy-related objects (heating, air conditioning,
white and brown goods, electric vehicles, etc.), thereby helping to
provide cohesion of the entire system, as well as its safety (security,
confidentiality, etc.);

m the shared Rise Grid laboratory, devoted to the modelling and simulation
of smart grids, in association with the Supélec engineering school;

m the SEISM institute for earthquake modelling from fault to structures,
bringing together EDF, the French Atomic Energy Commission
(Commissariat a I’Energie Atomique), Ecole centrale de Paris, ENS Cachan
and the national scientific research council CNRS;

= PGMO, the Gaspard Monge Programme for optimisation and operational
research, housed by the Jacques Hadamard Mathematics Foundation,
and established with the patronage of EDF's R&D Division;

= IMSIA, the Institute of Mechanical Sciences and Industrial Applications,
which since June 2015 has brought together ENSTA, CNRS, and CEA.
Saclay alongside EDF;

m the Energy Finance and Markets laboratory, shared with Dauphine
University, ENSAE and Ecole Polytechnique.

The R&D sites also accommodate two research units operated jointly
with CNRS: IMSIA (formerly LaMSID, the Laboratory for the Mechanics of
Sustainable Industrial Structures) and IRDEP, the Institute for Photovoltaic
Energy Research and Development, as well as an international R&D centre,
the Materials Aging Institute (MAI).

To conduct its research, EDF is continuing to invest in powerful and reliable
digital simulation resources. It develops cutting-edge computing code
and resources that are among the best in industry. Its current capacity is
1,400 teraflops.

In addition, the Group benefits from unique experimental resources; these
include specific analytical loops (chemicals/corrosion, failure, aero-acoustics,
etc.); loops focused on components or processes; resources for on-site test
interventions; or resources dedicated to the characterisation of materials
and their ageing. Two recent flagship installations are noted below:

= Concept Grid: a scaled-down electricity grid whose purpose is to try and
test the insertion of the innovative hardware and “intelligent” systems
that together make up a smart grid before installing them on the network.
Concept Grid is designed to prepare future developments of the grid
by studying the integration of new components and equipment from
the world of information and communication technology to facilitate
demand-side management. It is also intended to facilitate the integration
of decentralised production, by studying the behaviour of production
resources on the electricity system, and electricity storage applications.
Concept Grid provides the missing link between a conventional research
laboratory, in which innovations are tested in conditions that are not
entirely representative of reality, and the actual grid, where quality of
service considerations restrict experimentation;

= Vercors: construction of a reactor building to 1:3 scale in order to study
the ageing of double containment buildings.

R&D is also increasing its capacity for industrialisation and value creation
based on internal innovation, and with a view to benefiting further from
external innovation. The aim is to be able to integrate innovations in the
Group’s industrial processes. This policy is structured around two approaches:

= improving value creation from internal innovation and accelerating time to
business through initiatives conducted in collaboration with the business.
lines. For instance, a dedicated team helps to protect and leverage EDF
R&D intellectual property and expertise potential, and also to accelerate
the transfer and industrialisation of innovations;

1.6.2 R&D PRIORITIES

EDF’s R&D works for all the Group’s business lines. For each of them, it
offers technological solutions or innovative business and economic models
designed to improve their performance, and prepare the Group’s future in
the longer term by means of medium and long-term anticipation initiatives.
It is one of the factors in EDF becoming a global industrial group providing
low-carbon electricity systems.

EDF | 2015 Reference Document 95

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP.
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES

As the energy sector undergoes profound change, the goal of EDF R&D may
be defined in terms of three strategic avenues: consolidating and developing
competitive low-carbon production mixes, developing and testing new
energy services for clients and preparing the electricity systems of tomorrow.

R&D also conducts research in information technology to support these
three strategic avenues. This research is in turn structured around five
major areas: complex systems; the management and processing of large
volumes of data, the internet of things, cyber security; and the simulation
of physical problems.

Research in this field has a twofold purpose:

= improving business line performance through advanced simulation
technologies;

= facilitating the emergence of new opportunities for business lines through
innovative uses of new information and communications technologies.

1.6.2.1 Consolidating and developing

competitive carbon-free generation
mixes

In the field of nuclear, hydro and thermal power generation, EDF's R&D
develops tools and methods to improve the safety of the means of
production, optimise the latter‘s operational lifespan, and increase their
performance in terms of output and environmental impact. There are three
key priority goals: ensuring the Group maintains its advantage in nuclear
power over the long term; developing renewable energies; and examining
the industrial feasibility of carbon capture and storage.

To secure the Group's advantage in nuclear power generation in the long
term, R&D is also working to protect EDF's assets through actions in line
with its policy to improve the safety of installations, particularly with regard
to enhanced performance and extended operating lifespan. For instance,
in 2014, R&D conducted research to better understand and model ageing
phenomena in materials, in particular the steel used in reactor pressure
vessels and the concrete used in containment buildings. This research is
vital for managing the operating lifespan of installations, in particular for
non-replaceable components.

Other actions in the field of nuclear power deal with issues relating to the
fuel cycle. They include the design of new power plants, in particular fourth-
generation plants and Small Modular Reactors (SMR).

Lastly, R&D actions contribute to greater familiarity and better control of
the impact of installations on the environment, and at the same time, take
environmental risks to industrial installations more fully into account. So, for
instance, R&D is studying how the availability of water as a resource in the
future may develop in view of climate and territorial changes. R&D research
also contributes to understanding the possible risks and consequences on the
power generation fleet (availability of a cold source, scope for modulation,
location optimisation).

To support these programmes, R&D is developing digital solution tools and
experimental test resources, as well as tools capable of taking up the fresh
challenges raised by growing amounts of digital data, IT security, and new
information and communication technologies.

The events at Fukushima in 2011 have resulted in more research into
safety, the environment (external threats) and lifespan, as well as into
new topics such as the rehabilitation of inhabited areas evacuated after a
nuclear accident. Together with other European players in nuclear power,
in March 2012, EDF's R&D set up NUGENIA, an international non-profit
association whose purpose is to develop a single cooperative framework
for R&D in Europe for second and third-generation nuclear systems, as
part of the European Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform

(SNETP). The association brings together 80 members from 20 countries,
including industrial players, research entities, safety authorities and others.
EDF chairs this association, which will facilitate the emergence of synergies
and joint projects between members or with national R&D programmes,
in the following fields: safety and risk analysis; serious accidents; reactor
cores and performance; component integrity and ageing; fuel, waste and
decommissioning; “Innovative Generation Ill Design”; as well as cross-
functional challenges regarding the harmonisation of practices (in particular
in the field of safety), in addition to controls and non-destructive evaluation.
For the 2014-2015 request for projects, in 2014 NUGENIA submitted some
fifteen projects, most of them in the field of safety and the operating lifespan
of the existing fleet. In addition, the NUGENIA+ project has launched its own,
request for projects using funding allocated by the European Commission.

In 2012, EDF was also behind the launch of the Connexion project, devoted
to the digital nuclear Instrumentation & Control systems of the future, as
part of the French state's “Investments for the Future” projects '. This project
brings together industrial and academic partners working in the French
nuclear industry in an ambitious research programme designed to prepare
the future methods for the design, qualification and renovation of digital
1&C systems for power plants. The initiative also addresses the need to
harmonise industrial solutions within the industry. The systems engineering
methods developed during the course of this project are feeding into other
projects to design new nuclear power plant models, and contribute to the
digital transition policy being implemented by the group.

The second priority is support for the development of renewable energies.
These are playing a growing role in the energy landscape both within Europe
and worldwide, and EDF is already a major player here, and is seeking to
expand its role in the field still further.

For renewable energies, the goal of R&D is to identify technological
breakthroughs offering significant competitive advantage, and to help the
most promising technologies to emerge industrially, working in partnership
with the academic and industrial worlds. EDF is investigating a wide range
of renewable energies: hydro, photovoltaic, onshore and offshore wind
farms, thermodynamic solar power, biomass, marine energies, geothermal
energy, etc.

R&D is also working to develop tools and methods to enhance operational
performance and optimise the cost of the EDF group’s electricity production
system projects based on renewable energies, with a number of aims in mind

@ reducing investment risks: for instance, EDF's R&D is providing expertise
for the EDF group’s offshore windfarm projects, in particular as regards the
design of windfarm turbine systems and foundations, turbine certification,
and methods to evaluate production potential. The qualification in
2015 of a floating Lidar system to measure wind at projected offshore
windfarm sites has confirmed the improved performance delivered by
this innovative solution. R&D is also preparing the future by studying
floating offshore windfarm technologies, as well as supporting EDF EN
in the development of the Provence Grand Large project;

® improving operational performance: for instance, R&D has developed a
solution to measure machinery performance based on the monitoring
of the operational parameters of turbines. This diagnostic tool allows
underperforming turbines to be identified and a preliminary diagnosis
to be carried out;

= controlling the technical and economic impact on the electricity system;
and managing the electricity system balance as renewable energies
are incorporated. Research relates to the definition of procedures for
renewable energies to be inserted into electricity grids. This involves
analysing the various solutions allowing intermittent renewable energies
to be integrated, and evaluating the costs and limitations of their
integration into large systems: storage, super grids, smart grids, energy
management, etc.

1. “Investments for the Future” (Investissements d’avenir) is a loan initiated by the French government to fund research and innovation initiatives relevant to the economic

development of France.

96 EDF | 2015 Reference Document


--- Page 86 ---

The third priority is carbon capture and storage, and more generally the
limitation of CO, emissions from fossil-fired power plants (see section 1.4.1.3
“Thermal generation in mainland France”). The cost, the impact on
infrastructure performance and the lead times required to implement such
solutions constitute a major issue. Research by R&D is designed to provide
clarity as to the technical and economic maturity of the various capture
technologies in order for the group to have an informed view of the best
strategy for cutting the Group‘s thermal power plants’ CO, emissions.

For the existing power plants, the capture of CO, by processing exhaust
gases now appears to be the most appropriate solution.

With the support of French research agency ADEME and its partners, EDF
built and operated a CO, capture research demonstrator for a period of one
year at EDF's coal-fired power plant at Le Havre. Tested on the CO, present
in smoke from coal combustion, the technology involves the use of an
advanced “amine scrubbing post-combustion capture” process. Capturing
nearly 2,000 tonnes of CO,, the research demonstrator allowed the promising
performance of this technology in an industrial environment to be verified
with regard to its consumption of energy and solvents. Supplementary
studies are being carried out to extrapolate the results to industrial scale.

Elsewhere, R&D is also examining new avenues to prepare the emergence
of a second generation of CO, capture and storage technologies, with
a lower energy penalty, and to evaluate breakthrough technologies that
may increase installation performance considerably, with a corresponding
decrease in CO, emissions.

1.6.2.2 Developing and experimenting
with new energy services for clients

The development of energy efficiency and distributed renewable energies,
regulatory and technological (digitalisation) changes, as well as the opening
up to market competition, have all led to profound changes in the relationship
between energy firms and their clients. They allow clients to become actively
involved in their consumption and production of energy, both individually
and across entire territories.

In this context, the EDG group's marketers face multiple challenges:
= changes to rate-price trajectories;

m= demand-side management: under schemes such as “Green Deal” in the
UK and Energy Savings Certificates in France, suppliers must assume an
increasing number of obligations;

m the development of smart technologies: the arrival of smart meters
and the emergence of connected objects will, for the general public,
mean access to new services enabled by these new smart technologies
(monitoring, customised offers, etc.);

= changes in customer relations, destined to become increasingly digital,
with more demanding client expectations accompanied by changing
behaviours. However, the modernisation of this relationship should not
overshadow the parallel rise in energy poverty impacting customers in
need of an adequate service from their energy company;

m the growing power of local stakeholders as a result of France's Energy
Transition and “NOTRe” Boundaries Reform Acts: local authorities, already
actively engaged in urban planning and public energy distribution, will
be increasingly able to take control of their own energy destiny. The
notion of sustainable territories, which combines aspects of development
(eco-districts) and mobility (electric vehicles), will structure local policies.
New potential areas of service are emerging at the intersection of the
development of smart technologies and the increasing influence of
local communities.

PRESENTATION OF EDF GROUP
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES

In order to meet these challenges, EDF R&D is restructuring its action around
a number of topical priority programmes:

= developing load curve methods and models to provide close familiarity
with demand, as well as new rate structures and prices to encourage
dynamic demand-side management to meet new requirements in terms
of the flexibility of the electricity network;

= innovating to develop new uses for electricity (heat pumps for buildings
and industry, electric mobility) in order to stimulate future electricity
demand and effective energy solutions in the long term for all client
segments, in a way that is compatible with new regulatory frameworks;

= developing methods and resources to allow client relations to be
modernised, enhancing commercial performance and cutting costs
thanks to new information technologies and related data processing;
experimenting with smart grids downstream from meters, and preparing
the services and equipment to be used with Linky meters in buildings;

= designing and modelling local energy systems; developing the tools and
technologies to deliver an innovative service offering for sustainable
‘towns, cities and territories in France and internationally.

Asa result, research has been conducted into new uses for electricity, such
as electric mobility, heat pumps and more economic buildings. R&D has
developed a prototype of an industrial high-temperature heat pump that
allows waste heat from client processes to be recovered. The deployment
of this technology as part of a service offering to clients is underway.
Innovations that will ultimately allow the cost of heat pumps for buildings to
come down have also been developed. Lastly, innovations relating to smart
energy management for energy used for heating have been developed,
in particular for residential heat pumps and to modernise storage tanks,
making them more compatible with innovative control modes such as off-
peak periods for solar.

These works are specifically carried out on the ground via smart grid
demonstrators, such as Nice grid and Smart Electric Lyon, in which R&D
examines new models aggregating various types of flexible demand (load
management, deferred consumption, self-consumption, renewable energies,
and energy planning and management at local levels). R&D has also launched
an experimental project dealing with industrial load management based on
the remote coordination of processes.

Regarding customer relationships, in order for residential clients to be aware
of their electricity use between two bills, EDF has designed and developed
a prototype range of features compatible with smart meters, including an
application for smartphones and PCs that allows consumers to estimate
their bill, taking into account their own particular characteristics, seasonal
variations in their electricity consumption, and their past consumption
history. EDF's R&D is also working on research initiatives to fight energy
poverty, for example by designing relevant client relations offers and tools.

In sustainable territories, in order to meet the needs of cities that are
seeking to optimise infrastructures and their management (transport, waste
treatment, buildings, energy production, and networks) and aspiring to
become sustainable, “smart cities”, R&D is developing urban engineering
resources for EDF marketers in France, such as the study performed for the
Nice metropolitan area. R&D is also investing in a partnership with the city
of Singapore to develop a decision support tool for urban planning. As a
result, a development agreement for the City of the Future was signed in
June 2013 between EDF and the Housing Development Board of Singapore,
the leading builder of homes for the city, to develop an innovative IT solution
for urban modelling. In collaboration with the Singaporean authorities, this
solution covers: the energy efficiency of buildings and their air conditioning
systems, as well as the collection of household waste. It also includes the
possibility of addressing issues such as the incorporation of photovoltaics into
buildings, green roofs, and local water recycling. This modelling is coupled

with innovative 3D visualisation tools at the level of individual buildings or
a neighbourhood, of the impacts of planning decisions, for instance on
greenhouse gas emissions. The platform developed for this solution was
delivered on schedule in mid-2015. New fields of development are being
studied in collaboration with Singapore. The experience has already allowed
a project to be developed in Lyon for the new Gerland neighbourhood.

Electric mobility is another important aspect of sustainable cities: electric
transport opens up the prospect of a fundamental transformation of modes
of travel. Battery storage is the key technology for electric transport. R&D
research in this respect consists, firstly, in characterising battery safety and
performance in the laboratory, and secondly, in innovating in the terms
of breakthrough technologies with the potential to deliver significant
improvements in battery life or cost. R&D is also studying non-mobile
applications of these battery technologies (combining them with renewable
energies, system services, etc.).

More generally, the goals of R&D activities in the field of electric vehicles
(EV) and rechargeable hybrid vehicles (PHEV) are as follows:

™ support the development of this new use (monitoring initial
experimentation, standardisation, innovations with the potential to
remove market barriers, such as wireless charging);

™ manage integration into the electricity system (smart charging,
dimensioning and location of recharging stations);

m develop mobility service tools (fleet supervision platform, charging station
operation software, tools for mobility consulting for local authorities);

in particular, through partnerships with leading transport players (Renault,
PSA, RATP. and SNCF).

1.6.2.3. Preparing the electricity networks
of tomorrow

Energy transition towards a low-carbon economy in Europe implies meeting
new challenges:

™ encouraging the insertion of production from energy sources that are
renewable, but also intermittent;

@ integrating new uses of electricity by optimising the means of production
and grid requirements;

™ and also developing active demand-side management for local-level
decentralised energy systems integrated with larger-scale energy
management systems;

= optimising energy flows in Europe, and developing grid infrastructures;

= and more generally, in line with the public interest and the competitiveness
of electricity, optimising the economic equilibrium of the electricity system
(generation investments, investments in networks, costs/benefits of
energy and environmental efficiency solutions) without significant rise
in bills or complexity for clients, while also maintaining the quality and
reliability of the electricity system.

The trend towards more intelligent electricity systems, also known as smart
grids, is one of the pivotal points of the transition to a low-carbon energy
economy in Europe. The major challenges are technical, economic and
regulatory and, apart from the integrating renewable energy and new uses,
they are tied to the management of information for different network users
and the need to control costs.

R&D has set itself a number of priorities to meet these challenges.

98 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

The first one concerns the management of the balance between energy
supply and demand of all kinds:

= to anticipate the coming changes in the energy landscape, R&D is
developing forecasting models for the global landscape in the medium
to long term (the global macroeconomic environment; growth in energy
demand; energy and climate policies; the competitive and regulatory
environment; emerging technologies and potential breakthroughs, etc.);

® to anticipate the consequences of the development of new means of
production or uses, it is developing electricity system models enabling
an anticipation of flexibility requirements and the margins needed
to ensure equilibrium between supply and demand. To evaluate the
costs and benefits of the various options in an objective manner, it is
implementing and proposing harmonised methods of analysis to the
various stakeholders;

= lastly, for the operational management of supply/demand equilibrium in
relation with EDF's own scope of equilibrium, R&D is developing decision
support tools to optimise and manage EDF's portfolio risks on European
electricity and gas markets.

The second priority is to improve the performance of electricity grids. Research
conducted by R&D in this field has the following aims:

= improve the management of grid assets in France and abroad by working
on equipment lifespans and network availability;

® increase the automation of distribution networks to optimise the quality
of service and reduce operating costs.

The third priority is to prepare the transition to the electricity system models
of tomorrow or smart grids, notably through the following goals:

® supporting the development of the Linky project (see section 1.4.4.2.4
“Future challenges: renewal, development, smart meters” and
section 5.1.3.4.2.1 “ERDF: rollout of Linky smart meters”) and anticipating
new smart metering architectures and related services;

® preparing and contributing to smart grid experiments;

= inserting intermittent, decentralised energy production in networks;
developing new system services and preparing for future local energy
balances;

® trialling and industrialising new solutions based on storage systems to
deliver value to electricity systems and networks.

R&D is also involved in the development of new functionality relating to
the coordination and operation of the grid, as well as new solutions in the
environment of new smart meters, such as ERDF’s Linky project. For example,
R&D has developed and trialled a new distribution network coordination
feature associated with decentralised production. Based on an estimate of
the condition of the network, this innovative coordination method makes
it possible to maintain high-tension grid voltage within a contractual range
even when there are fluctuations in output from decentralised production
resources.

R&D is also testing electricity use management systems based on the
Linky infrastructure. In particular, these experimentations have shown
the feasibility of load disruption, such as electric heating, to reduce peak
consumption periods.

It develops solutions to improve forecasts of losses on the network and
develop local energy balance forecasts (source substations).

It contributes its expertise to every aspect of the Linky project, in particular
the drafting specifications and qualifying equipment.


--- Page 88 ---

Lastly, R&D is also working on electricity systems and super grids, the direct-
current networks that could emerge with the insertion of renewable energies
that alter the technical and economic fundamentals of electricity networks.

In order to prepare the solutions to these new challenges, a number of smart
electricity demonstrators are currently under development in France and
Europe, based on a collaborative approach. R&D is heavily involved in this
respect with NiceGrid, Smart Electric Lyon, Venteea, Pégase, etc., with the
aim of shedding light specific issues relating to the transition of the electricity
system, learning technical and economic but also social and environmental
lessons, as well as considering business models and regulation. EDF’s R&D
is also testing multiple innovative solutions prior to deployment in the
field using Concept Grid, its new test platform dedicated to the intelligent
electricity systems of tomorrow. These projects also offer opportunities to
reflect and innovate, together with the electricity sector as a whole and
the ‘new information and communications technologies’ sector, in order
to best adapt the equipment to the flexibility requirements of the electricity
systems of the future. A large number of experiments are exploring all the
potential of smart meters, the first link in the smart electricity network chain.

1.6.3 INTERNATIONAL AND PARTNERSHIPS

To conduct its research and development programmes, EDF's R&D develops
a large number of partnerships worldwide, the purpose of which is to
maintain its expertise at the highest global level in the disciplines central to
EDF's concerns, and to supplement its internal reservoir of skills.

The partnership policy of R&D takes various forms both nationally and
internationally.

In France, over the past few years R&D has set up 14 joint laboratories with
academic partners and technical or industrial centres and participates with
them in collaborative research projects funded by national agencies like the
National Research Agency, the ADEME or the Single Interministerial Fund,
via competitiveness clusters. Each joint laboratory offers an opportunity
to establish a combined team around a common scientific and technical
problem, in order to create value, expertise and knowledge for all partners,
and constitutes a major asset when taking part in cooperative projects. R&D.
also supports four specially targeted teaching and research chairs.

In the field of nuclear R&D, the tripartite agreement between CEA, EDF and
AREVA that expired at the end of 2012 was extended for a further year and
followed by a new nuclear R&D agreement in early 2014. This new “Institute”
agreement is designed to increase R&D programme coordination between
partners and to have programmes defined with reference to detailed goals,
particularly industrial goals. In practical terms, this entails the following:

m the establishment of a Tripartite Programme Team (équipe programme
tripartite, EPT), in charge of the supervision and coordination of
programmes. This team consists of four members per partner, for a
total of 12 members;

® the organisation of these programmes into projects monitored by the EPT;
® the implementation of these programmes in the existing joint laboratories.

At the same time, the tripartiteagreement on R&D between CEA, IRSN and
EDF that expired in 2012 and was extended in 2013 was also the subject of
negotiations in 2014; this has led to the signature of a four-party agreement
including AREVA, allowing enhanced coordination with the “Institute” policy.

R&D is also present within the Energy Transition Institutes (/nstituts de la
transition énergétique, ITE) set up as part of “Investments for the Future”
initiative:

= The Institut photovoltaique ile-de-France (|PVF): this institut, of which EDF
is a founding members, targets technological breakthroughs to make
photovoltaic energy competitive in the market. Ultimately, the Institute
will bring together some 150 researchers from the different partners at
a State-of-the-art facility in Saclay;

= France Energies Marines, devoted to marine energies and offshore
wind farms;

= Paris-Saclay Efficacité Energétique (PS2E), working on the energy
efficiency of industrial procedures and energy controls in industrial parks;

= SuperGrid, focusing on major transport networks to connect remote
renewable energy production sites;

m= Vedecom, devoted to electric mobility;
= Efficacity, working on energy efficiency and sustainable cities; and

m INEF 4, working in the field of building rehabilitation and sustainable
construction.

“EDF” was also behind the launch in 2012 of the Connexion project, focusing
on future digital nuclear Instrumentation & Control systems as part of the
“Investments for the Future” initiative (see section 1.6.2.1 “Consolidating
and developing competitive carbon-free generation mixes”). In Europe,
R&D participates in some thirty EU projects and has established links with
the Joint Research Center, a European Union energy and transport research
centre whose objective is to collaborate on low-carbon technologies and
on electricity storage in particular. EDF is also a founding member of several
European associations recognised at the EU level, such as Nugenia for nuclear
power and EASE for storage.

Since the early 2000s, EDF has had a research centre in Germany - EIFER
- in collaboration with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). This
centre is chiefly devoted to decentralised production (fuel cells, hydrogen),
sustainable cities and territories, geothermal energy, and biofuels. In recent
years, partnership agreements have been signed with Fraunhofer institutes,
the University of Stuttgart, and TU Berlin.

Since 2010, research activity has been strengthened internationally around
several centres: in Poland, in the UK, in China, in Singapore, in the USA
and in Italy.

The british centre consolidates the Group’s positions in the British research
ecosystem, particularly through Strathclyde University in the field of
renewables, as well as with Manchester University, Imperial College, the
National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) and the University of Bristol in the field
of nuclear energy. In 2012, this research centre became an independent
legal entity, EDF Energy R&D UK Centre Ltd. This subsidiary is part of EDF
Energy. This new status increases EDF's visibility and the research capabilities
in the UK, in line with the Group’s development strategy.

EDF Polska’s research team is dedicated to advanced fossil fuel issues,
biomass co-combustion, and more recently, heating networks. The R&D
Polska Centre has developed collaborative work with Polish universities,
including AGH at Krakow and Wroclaw University.

The centre based in Beijing is a particular asset when it comes to taking part
in large-scale Chinese demonstrators for smart grids, sustainable cities, and
a number of renewable energy technologies. This centre is also a resource
in facilitating the implementation of the research partnership for nuclear
power in China (see section 1.4.5.3.6 1 “Activities in China”). The creation
of the centre has been accompanied by significant development of academic
and industrial partnerships in China. For instance, EDF has signed a joint
research programme in China relating to thermodynamic solar power. The
cooperation underway with the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of
Electrical Engineering mainly concerns research and innovation work carried
out on a testing platform dedicated to solar thermal power technologies
located in Badaling. One of the challenges for EDF is to further improve its
modelling capacities using measurements performed during experiments
conducted on this platform.

The main goal of the Edison R&D team in Italy is to coordinate all gas research
programmes for the EDF group. In 2015, Edison and the University of Turin
set up a joint laboratory devoted to this topic.

the US linked to distributed energy resources and micro grids, smart cities,
integration of renewable energies, and management of data for emerging
energy services. EDF Innovation Lab also contributes to the partnerships
developed a long time ago by EDF with excellence organizations such as
EPRI, MIT and UC Berkeley, among others.

In Singapore, EDF labs Singapore was set up in early 2014 to support the
service contract for the city’s Housing Development Board. This centre is
devoted mainly to research into sustainable cities.

1.6.4 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY

Intellectual property plays a major role in the protection of the EDF group’s
technologies and know-how against the competition, as well as the
capitalisation of these assets through licensing.

EDF wants to strengthen its industrial property portfolio in order to make
the most of its capacity for innovation and its technological expertise.
The portfolio is made up of patents, registered software and formalised
know-how.

Patents

As of the end of 2015, EDF's portfolio included 541 patented innovations,
protected by 1,902 property titles in France and abroad.

Strengthening the patent portfolio is a priority. The aim of this is to facilitate
R&D cooperation, protect the development of EDF's activities, contribute
to EDF's external image, boost the motivation of researchers, and provide
maximum leverage for inventions.

In 2015, EDF filed 64 patent applications ' (60 in 2014).

Trademarks

1.7.1 SERVICE SECTOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS

EDF's Real Estate Division, attached to Group’s Real Estate and Insurance
Department, operates in France as the real estate provider of entities within
EDF and ERDF by managing and optimising a real estate portfolio of nearly
4.4 million square meters of service premises, approximately 68% of which
is owned outright by the Group and 32% is leased from third parties (leases
and concessions).

The Real Estate Division is in charge of real estate asset management, lease
management, the technical operation of building as well as the operation-
maintenance of the facilities and the services provided to occupants, by
offering areas through a sub-lease system for Group entities and units.
By taking leases from third parties, the Real Estate Division made lease
commitments for EDF amounting to €951 million for the period from
2016-2030.

1.7.2 EMPLOYER PARTICIPATION
IN THE CONSTRUCTION EFFORT

In exchange for this payment, EDF's employees benefit from services intended
to facilitate their residential mobility: assistance with renting, assistance with
home purchase, assistance with mobility, advice on financing.

1.7.3 SUBSIDISED HOME OWNERSHIP LOANS

As part of its social policy, EDF assists its employees to purchase their primary
residence. Thanks to a partnership concluded with Crédit Immobilier de
France (CIF), the bank manages the production, financing, and management
of loans to the company’s employees. EDF compensates the CIF for the
difference between the subsidised rate at which CIF grants loans to EDF
employees and the rate resulting from the bank survey conducted in 2005
on the basis of which the CIF was chosen.

As of 31 December 2015, the residual non-securitised balance for personal
residence mortgages was €3.3 million on EDF's balance sheet (€3.9 million
as of 31 December 2014).
