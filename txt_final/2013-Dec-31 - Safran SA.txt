COMMENTS ON THE GROUP'’S PERFORMANCE IN 2013 BASED ON ADJUSTED DATA

2.1 COMMENTS ON THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2013
BASED ON ADJUSTED DATA

21.1

RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED DATA WITH ADJUSTED DATA

Foreword

To reflect the Group's actual economic performance and enable
it to be monitored and benchmarked against competitors, Safran
prepares an adjusted income statement alongside its consolidated
financial statements.

Readers are reminded that Safran:

is the result of the May 11, 2005 merger of the Sagem and
Snecma groups, accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3,
Business Combinations, in its consolidated financial statements;

recognizes, as of July 1, 2005, all changes in the fair value
of its foreign currency derivatives in “Financial income (loss)",
in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39 applicable to
transactions not qualifying for hedge accounting (see section 3.1,
“Accounting policies”, Note 1f).

Accordingly, Safran’s consolidated income statement has been
adjusted for the impact of:

purchase price allocations with respect to business
combinations. Since 2005, this restatement concerns the

amortization charged against intangible assets relating to
aircraft programs revalued at the time of the Sagem-Snecma
merger. With effect from the 2010 interim consolidated financial
statements, the Group decided to restate the impact of purchase
price allocations for all business combinations. In particular, this
concerns the amortization of intangible assets recognized at the
time of the acquisition and amortized over extended periods due
to the length of the Group’s business cycles, along with gains
or losses on remeasuring the Group's previously held interests
in an entity acquired in a step acquisition;

the mark-to-market of foreign currency derivatives, in order to

better reflect the economic substance of the Group's overall

foreign currency risk hedging strategy:

— revenue net of purchases denominated in foreign currencies
is measured using the effective hedged rate, i.e., including
the costs of the hedging strategy,

- all mark-to-market changes on foreign currency derivatives
hedging future cash flows are neutralized.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IN 2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2014

COMMENTS ON THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2013 BASED ON ADJUSTED DATA

Review of operations
ADJUSTED REVENUE

For full-year 2013, Safran's revenue was €14,695 million, an
8.4% year-on-year increase (8.2% organic growth), compared to
€13,560 million in 2012.

Full-year 2013 revenue increased by €1,135 million on a
reported basis, notably highlighting performance in the Group's
Aerospace businesses. On an organic basis, revenue increased
by €1,118 million with higher Aerospace original equipment (OE)
volumes, strong civil aftermarket trends, stability in the Security
business and resilience in the Defence business (avionics).

ADJUSTED RECURRING OPERATING INCOME

For full-year 2013, Safran’s recurring operating income increased
€344 million or 23.8% compared to 2012 and stood at
€1,788 million, or 12.2% of revenue (€1,444 million and 10.6% of
revenue in 2012). Before taking into account the impact of currency
hedging (€103 million) and of acquisitions, newly consolidated
activities and disposals (€7 million), the organic year-on-year
improvement was €234 million, or 16.2%.

The improvement was primarily driven by the Aerospace Propulsion
and Aircraft Equipment activities, which saw solid OE growth and
positive trends in the civil aftermarket, as well as by a confirmation
of the turnaround of avionics in Defence.

(1) The data published for 2012 have been restated to reflect the impact of the change in accounting policy resulting from the retrospective application of the amended

JAS 19, Employee Benefits (see section 3.1, Note 3).

ADJUSTED PROFIT FROM OPERATIONS

Adjusted profit from operations climbed 26.0% to €1,757 million
versus €1,394 million in 2012. Non-recurring items represented
an expense of €31 million in 2013, and include capital gains on
the disposal of Globe Motors Inc. and an office building in Paris;
impairment of capitalized development costs related to a legacy
engine program; and other charges principally related to past
service costs arising on a defined benefit supplementary pension
plan for which executive managers within the Group, currently
numbering around 400, are eligible.

ADJUSTED FINANCIAL INCOME (LOSS)

The Group reported an adjusted financial loss of €138 million in
2013, compared to a loss of €154 million in 2012. The financial
loss chiefly reflects the cost of net debt, which was down slightly
year-on-year, to €42 million from €54 million in 2012. The financial
loss also includes the cost of unwinding discounts on certain assets
and liabilities (mainly provisions and repayable advances), as well as
the impact of any changes in the discount rates used, particularly
to calculate provisions. The cumulative impact of these non-cash
items was an expense of €50 million in 2013 and an expense of
€90 million in 2012. The interest cost on post-employment benefit
obligations amounted to €24 million in 2013 versus €23 million
‘one year earlier.

ADJUSTED INCOME TAX EXPENSE

The adjusted income tax expense for the year increased from
€254 million in 2012 to €540 million in 2013, reflecting a higher
effective tax rate than in 2012 when the Group's tax expense had
notably included the favorable impact of the absorption by Safran
of subsidiaries which had been involved in loss-making activities
divested several years ago. In 2013, a one-off, temporary (2013-14)
tax surcharge increased the applicable corporate tax rate to 38%
of taxable income in France.

ADJUSTED PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO OWNERS
OF THE PARENT

Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent grew by 22%
year-on-year. It was €1,193 million or €2.87 per share, compared
to €979 million (€2.36 per share) in full-year 2012. In addition to the
rise in recurring operating income, adjusted profit for 2013 includes:

* net financial expense of €138 million, including cost of debt of
€42 million;

° tax expense of €540 million;
* capital gains on the disposal of Ingenico shares of €131 million.

REVIEW OF AEROSPACE PROPULSION OPERATIONS
IN 2013

Full-year 2013 revenue grew by 11.2% at €7,791 million, or 11.3%
on an organic basis, compared to revenue of €7,005 million in
the year-ago period. Revenue growth resulted from rising civil
OE deliveries, with CFM56 reaching record production rates
(1,502 units, 96 units more than in 2012) and a favorable mix and
pricing. Total CFM56 and LEAP orders and commitments now stand
at close to 10,800 engines, more than seven years of production

at current rates. Military propulsion revenue declined slightly as
revenue from TP400 deliveries almost offset the decline in M88
sales. Helicopter turbine OE revenues also showed robust growth
due to a favorable mix. Space and missile propulsion revenue was
flat in the year. In September 2013, Safran finalized a transaction
with Rolls-Royce resulting in the extension to 100% of Safran’s
ownership in the RTM322 helicopter engine program, which was
previously jointly owned. Full ownership of the program extends
Turbomeca's range into large turbines for the high-growth heavy

helicopter market, enabling growth for military applications and
accelerating time to market for heavy commercial engines. Support
contracts previously fulfilled by Rolls-Royce have been transferred
and the internalization of Rolls-Royce’s workshare has been
initiated.

Aftermarket trends were particularly positive and civil aftermarket
revenue grew by 19.2% in USD terms, driven by first overhauls of
recent CFM56 and GEQ0 engines. Helicopter turbine maintenance
and the military engine aftermarket both grew at a mid-single digit
percentage rate. Overall service revenue in Aerospace Propulsion
grew by 14% in euro terms and represents a 48.1% share of
revenue.

Full-year 2013 recurring operating income was €1,359 million
(17.4% of revenue), up 26.3% compared to €1,076 million in the
year-ago period (15.4% of revenue). This improvement resulted from
healthy activity in the civil aftermarket, as well as from increased
OE volume and favorable mix and pricing on commercial engine
programs. R&D costs grew in 2013, primarily due to increased
LEAP and Silvercrest development spending, essentially all of
which is capitalized. Currency hedging had a positive impact on
profitability.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Civil aviation

® Low-thrust engines for civil aircraft (regional and business
jets)
Silvercrest (9,500 - 12,000 pounds of thrust)

Chosen by two aircraft manufacturers, the Silvercrest engine
developed by Safran incorporates leading-edge technology to
offer unrivalled performance, with ambitious targets in terms of
fuel consumption, reliability and respect for the environment.

After having been chosen by Cessna to power its new Citation
Longitude business jet in 2012, Safran was selected by Dassault
Aviation to supply the engine and key equipment on the company’s
new Falcon 5X twin-engine business jet, featuring a large cabin and
long range (5,200 nautical miles, or more than 9,600km). Safran
will supply the complete integrated powerplant system (IPPS),
including the Silvercrest engine (Snecma), nacelle and thrust
reversers (Aircelle), and the engine suspension system. The engine
is also equipped with a FADEC" system specifically developed by
Sagem. This contract marks a strategic step forward for Safran in
the market for business jets.

Since ground tests began on the first engine in October 2012,
Silvercrest reached — and exceeded — maximum take-off thrust.
The results of the tests show the engine's excellent dynamic
performance at all thrust levels, with very good operability and
very low levels of noise and vibrations. The performance tests were
carried out on test rigs at Snecma’s Villaroche (closed test cell) and
Istres (open-air test cell) plants. Tests will continue throughout 2014
with certification slated for 2015.

(1) Full Authority Digital Engine Control.

Alongside these tests, the assembly line for the series production
of the Silvercrest engines has been set up at Villaroche.

SaM146 (13,500 — 17,800 pounds of thrust)

The SaM146 engine, developed in partnership with Russian engine
manufacturer NPO Saturn and with the participation of Italian
engine manufacturer Avio Aero, powers Sukhoi’s Superjet 100.

A total of 52 SaM146 engines were delivered in 2013. At the end of
the year, the backlog for PowerJet stood at 202 engines. Powerjet
is ajoint venture set up by Snecma and NPO Saturn to manage the
engine program in terms of development, production, marketing
and sales, and to provide customer support, maintenance, repair
and overhaul services.

At the end of 2013, PowerJet had also been awarded service
contracts by Aeroflot, Interjet and Sky Aviation airlines.

Passport (10,000 - 20,000 pounds of thrust)

Through Techspace Aero, Safran has a 7% share in Passport,
anew GE engine program designed for the future Bombardier,
Global 7000 and 8000 business jets. Global 8000 will have a
range comparable to long-haul aircraft (7,900 miles, or more than
44,600 km).

Ground testing for Passport began in June 2013 and the engine
reached more than 18,000 pounds of thrust. The Passport engine
is slated for certification in 2015.

SMA

The turboprop SMA SR305-230E powers Turbo Skylane JT-A, the
latest aircraft in the Cessna 182 range. A total of 45 engines were
delivered in 2013 and the backlog at the end of the year stood at
263 units.

@ CFM mid-thrust engines for civil aircraft
(short- to medium-haul aircraft)

CFMS56 - LEAP

On the A320neo, the LEAP-1A model competes with the
PurePower PW1000G engine made by US firm Pratt & Whitney.
At December 31, 2013, LEAP-1A had a market share of 50% in
aircraft for which engines had already been chosen. The LEAP-1B
model was chosen as the sole engine for the Boeing 737 MAX.
The LEAP-1C is the sole Western source for the propulsion system
(engine plus nacelle) on COMAC's C919 Chinese aircraft. LEAP is
expected to be in service by 2016.

2013 also saw a string of major commercial successes. Orders
continued to grow for LEAP engines. With new orders and
purchase commitments for 1,393 engines in 2013, the backlog
for LEAP overtook the CFM56 backlog for the first time, to stand
at over 5,700 engines under the A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX and
COMAC C919 programs.

year, up 7% on 2012 (1,406). More than 25,700 CFMS56 engines
have been delivered since the launch of the program. The in-service
fleet of CFM56 engines passed the 668 million flying hours mark
in 2013 and the engines are used by over 530 customers and
operators.

Taking into account the 1,330 orders for CFM56 engines and
1,393 orders for LEAP engines taken during the year, the overall
backlog (CFM56 + LEAP) represents around 10,800 engines, or
more than seven years of production at current rates. This success
confirms CFM as leader in the market for 100+ seater aircraft, and
guarantees the success of these programs over several decades.

The first ground tests for LEAP-1A were run in 2013 with
excellent results: in almost five weeks of tests, the engine logged
310 hours of operation and over 400 cycles. These tests are part
of an extensive ground and flight certification program that will
encompass 60 engines and will accumulate 40,000 test cycles
before entry into service.

CFM56 engines deliver industry-leading reliability and operational
performance.

@ High-thrust engines for civil aircraft (long-haul aircraft)

Production of high-thrust engines was up sharply in 2013, with
619 modules delivered compared to 567 in 2012.

GE90 family

Safran has an interest of around 23.5% in this GE program and
enjoys a sole-source position on the Boeing 777, for which it
delivered 212 modules in 2013 versus 187 modules in 2012.

GP7200

Safran delivered 96 high- and low-pressure compressor modules
in 2013 compared to 62 in 2012, and has a 17.5% interest in this
engine program which powers the A380. At the end of the year,
the GP7200 was used by three airlines and has been selected for
almost 55% of the A380 aircraft for which an engine has already
been chosen.

GenX

The GenX engines manufactured for the Boeing 747-8 and
Boeing 787, respectively GenX-2B and Genx-1B, were certified
in 2011. Safran has a 7.3% share in GenX-2B and a 7.7% share
in GenX-1B. The US aircraft manufacturer ramped up its monthly
Boeing 787 production during the year and Safran delivered
181 compressor modules, 20% more than in 2012.

CF6 - LM6000 family

A total of 130 modules were shipped in 2013. Safran’s interest in
this program ranges from 10% to 19.4%, depending on the engine
model concerned.

Service agreements

Safran has signed service agreements with GE for its high-thrust
GE90 and GP7200 engines. Service agreements for these engines
were also signed with Emirates and Etihad Airways.

® Industrial operations

Safran has developed an exclusive partnership with US-based
Albany for three-dimensional weaving of carbon fiber preforms.
These preforms are placed in metal molds and then injected with
resin.

The ties between Safran and Albany were recently strengthened
with the creation of production facilities bringing together the
resources and activities of both companies. A shared facility in
Rochester, New Hampshire (United States) will be used to produce
woven composite parts for the LEAP engine.

A “twin” facility is currently under construction in Commercy in the
Meuse region of France. This new 27,000 sq.m. facility will begin to
produce blades and casings for the LEAP engine in 2014.

Military aviation

= M8

In 2013, 20 M88 engines were delivered for the Rafale. The
in-service fleet topped the 295,500 flying hours mark during the
year.

India is in exclusive talks with Rafale EIG to purchase 126 aircraft.
Discussions are continuing under the guidance of Dassault. Other
prospective customers are also being canvassed.

™ TP400

The TP400 is the Western world's largest ever turboprop engine.
Having been awarded both civil and military certification, the TP400
meets the highest safety standards of global civil aviation and
provides potential export opportunities for the A400M Atlas.

A total of 36 engines were delivered in 2013 and the backlog at
‘the end of the year stood at 674 engines for the A400M Atlas fleet
ordered by Airbus Defence & Space. The two first A400M Atlas
aircraft were delivered to the French Armed Forces during the year.

COMMENTS ON THE GROUP'’S PERFORMANCE IN 2013 BASED ON ADJUSTED DATA

Helicopter turbine engines

® Light helicopters

This segment continued to grow throughout the year:

e the new Arriel 2 (2E) engine was certified by the European
Aviation Safety Agency in January 2013. This engine will power
Airbus Helicopters’ twin-engine EC145T2;

* anew Arrius turbo engine model was on show at the Heli-Expo
tradeshow in March 2013. The Arrius 2B2 Plus, equipped with
anew FADEC system, is designed for Airbus Helicopters’ future
lightweight, twin-turbine EC135T3.

Safran landed another win at the Paris Air Show, when Bell
Helicopter chose Arrius 2R to power its new five-seat short, light
single (SLS) engine helicopter. This marks the first long-term
partnership between Safran and Bell Helicopter.

@ Medium-weight helicopters

Safran unveiled Arrano, its brand-new turboshaft engine, at
the Heli-Expo tradeshow in March 2013. The new 1,100 shp
engine benefits from the technological developments resulting
from Safran’s R&T strategy. It incorporates the results of several
upstream research projects, including products and processes
validated by the Tech800 demonstrator. Arrano is expected to first
run on a test cell in 2014.

At the MAKS Air Show in Moscow in August 2013, Safran
unveiled its Ardiden 3G engine installed on a prototype of the
Ka-62, a civilian helicopter built by Russian heli manufacturer
Kamov. Illustrating the pertinence of Safran’s strategic choices,
Colombian operator Vertical de Aviacion ordered five Ka-62s on
the opening day of the show. This order follows on from the deal
signed in December 2012 with Brazilian operator Atlas Taxi Aero
for 14 helicopters, and confirms Safran’s successful partnership
with the Russian high-tech industry.

The Ardiden 3C/WZ16 engine completed its first test bench run
at the end of 2013. This turboprop engine was developed in
partnership with AVIC Engines (China) for the AC352 helicopter
(the Chinese name for Airbus Helicopters’ EC175 program), and
is the result of close cooperation between Safran and AVIC (China
Aviation Industry Corporation). The test bench run marks the start
of the engine's test and certification procedure.

@ Heavy-lift helicopters

In order to further its investment and development strategy
focused on new engines for heavy-lift helicopters (3,000 shp and
above), in 2013 Safran acquired Rolls-Royce's 50% stake in the
joint RTM322 helicopter engine program, and has now assumed
global responsibility for the design, production, product support
and services for the RTM322 engine. This 2,100-2,600 shp model
powers the Apache (UK fleet), EH101 Merlin and NH90 helicopters.

(1) Europropulsion: joint venture with Safran and Avio.

™@ Services

Safran continued to expand sales of service agreements in 2013:

* acontract was signed with the UK Ministry of Defence for the
maintenance of 411 RTM322 engines powering the EH101
Merlin and Apache helicopters. The six-year contract provides
the UK MoD with a guaranteed level of availability for its RTM322
engines, consolidating a number of current support agreements.
into one overall support package;

* accontract with Avincis group was announced for the
maintenance of around 180 engines operated by Inaer, Bond Air
Services, Bond Offshore Helicopters and Australian Helicopters;

* at the Heli-Expo tradeshow, a contract was signed with Canada-
based CHC Helicopter for the maintenance of 60 Makila 2
engines powering their EC 225 helicopters. These helicopters
are used in offshore missions, mainly in the North Sea, Nigeria,
Brazil and Australia;

* apartnership was sealed with Milestone Aviation group, the
global leader in helicopter leasing, under which services will
be provided directly to Milestone customers while expanding
Turbomeca’s customer base;

* an agreement was also signed for the repair, overhaul and
inspection of the Makila 1A2 engines powering the 17 AS532
Cougar helicopters operated by the Dutch Royal Air Force.

Ballistics and space

The European heavy-lift launcher Ariane 5 successfully completed
four lift-offs in 2013, two less than expected due to technical
difficulties on the satellites. This marks the European launch
vehicle's 57th consecutive success and confirms the excellent
reliability of Ariane.

In the liquid propellant engine segment, six Vulcain engines for the
core stage of the ES and ECA versions of Ariane 5 and four HM7
engines for the upper stage of Ariane 5 ECA were delivered in 2013.

In 2013, Safran also delivered six series of solid propellant boosters,
which provide 90% of Ariane 5's lift-off thrust.

An agreement was signed in late 2013 between Airbus Defence &
Space, Safran and Europropulsion") for the production of the
cryogenic rocket engines and solid rocket motors for 18 new
Ariane 5 launchers. This agreement allows Safran and its European
partners to secure the continued production of Ariane 5 engines
until the end of 2018.

2013 also marked the successful kick-off of a new series of tests
for the Vinci engine. The continued development of this propellant
intended for the upper stage of the future Ariane 5 ME (Midlife
Evolution) and Ariane 6 launchers is on track to meet the technical
objectives and timetable set by the European Space Agency (ESA).
The first test flight for this new engine on Ariane 5 ME is scheduled
for mid-2018.

Safran was awarded responsibility for the upstream solid propulsion
project for Ariane 6 that led to the choice of configuration of the
future launch vehicle. Four identical engines forming the first two.

stages will make full use of the synergies with Vega, the future
engine for the launch vehicle. The third stage will be an adapted
version of the upper stage of Ariane 5 ME, fitted with a Vinci
cryogenic engine developed by Snecma.

Safran is also a major contributor to Vega, the European launch
vehicle. The second Vega successfully completed its lift-off from
the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana on May 7, 2013. Towards
the end of the year, Arianespace ordered ten new additional Vega
launch vehicles. Representing more than three years’ work, they
will follow on from the test launch vehicle and five Vega launch
vehicles ordered in 2010.

2.1.3.2 Aircraft Equipment

In the industrial applications sector, a new plant producing
propellants for airbags was inaugurated in the Caohu business
park, 80 km from Shanghai (China). This new 7,000 sq.m. plant
results from the joint venture SMECQ Automotive Safety Technology
Co. Ltd. set up in October 2010 by Safran and TaiHang ChangQing
(THCQ), a subsidiary of China Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC).
SMECQ was set up to produce 300 metric tons of latest-generation
gas generator propellants, or the equivalent of 7 million airbags by
2016, in order to meet the growing Chinese demand for automotive
safety.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IN 2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2014

COMMENTS ON THE GROUP'’S PERFORMANCE IN 2013 BASED ON ADJUSTED DATA

REVIEW OF AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS
IN 2013

The Aircraft Equipment segment reported full-year 2013 revenue
of €4,121 million, up 11.6% (9.8% on an organic basis) compared
to the year-ago period.

Increases in OE production rates (notably the Boeing 787, A330
and A380 programs) and the continued recovery of the regional jets
market segment drove revenue increases in all activities. The nacelle
activity recorded increases in A330 and A320 thrust reversers and
in small nacelles. The number of A380 nacelles delivered (108)
was stable compared to 2012. The harnessing and landing gear
activities saw a robust performance driven by a production ramp-up
in all their civil programs including the first shipments to the A350
program. Shipments began in 2013 on the A400M Atlas program
to which Safran supplies landing systems.

On a full-year basis, service revenue grew by 15.2% in euro terms.
and represents 29.5% of segment revenue. Excluding GEPS, the
increase in service revenue was 8.9%. This increase is principally
driven by aftermarket growth in wheels and brakes (including
carbon brakes), gearboxes and nacelles. The increase of service
revenue in the sales mix has a favorable impact on profitability.

Full-year 2013 recurring operating income was €380 million (9.2%
of revenue), up 32.9% compared to €286 million in the year-ago
period (7.7% of revenue). This significant improvement was
driven by a favorable volume impact and productivity gains. The
increased service activity for wheels and brakes also contributed
to this performance. Currency hedging had a positive impact on
profitability.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Landing and aircraft systems

@ Landing gear

In all, 1,319 landing gear units were delivered by Safran in 2013,
128 more than in 2012.

To meet the ramp-up in monthly production on the Boeing 787,
61 units were delivered by Messier-Bugatti-Dowty in the year
(42 in 2012).

Safran continued to upgrade its production facilities in 2013, chiefly
in Montreal (Canada) and Bidos in the French Pyrénées-Atlantiques
region.

Throughout 2013, Safran signed landing gear maintenance and
repair contracts notably for the Airbus fleets operated by Alitalia,
Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, Iberia, China Eastern Airlines and South
African Airways. These new contracts strengthen Safran’s position
as a global player in the maintenance and repair of Airbus landing
gear units.

Wheels and brakes

At December 31, 2013, more than 6,100 aircraft were equipped
with Messier-Bugatti-Dowty carbon brakes, giving Safran a share
of over 50% of the market for 100+ seater civilian aircraft equipped
with carbon brakes.

Safran brakes had been selected for 1,185 Boeing 737NG aircraft
(cumulative basis) at December 31, 2013 (891 at end-2012),
including 581 aircraft in connection with retrofit projects. A total
of 643 of these 1,185 aircraft are already in service. Safran’s
market share on Boeing 737NG aircraft fitted with carbon brakes
represents 68%.

Messier-Bugatti-Dowty's electric brakes for the Boeing 787
Dreamliner continue to capture market share. After being selected
by Ethiopian Airlines in 2012, in 2013 they were chosen for
aircraft operated by Air Canada, Aeromexico, AviancaTaca, Royal
Jordanian Airlines, Air New Zealand, Kenya Airways, Thai Airways
International and Royal Brunei.

Electric green taxiing system

To meet the demand for more integrated equipment offerings
from both aircraft manufacturers and airlines, in 2012 Safran and
Honeywell set up a joint venture, EGTS International. This joint
venture allows them to pool their complementary expertise and
work together to develop and market a new electric green taxiing
system, i.e., taxiing without the use of engine power. The aim is
to fit both in-service and new aircraft with this system as from
2016/2017.

Electric green taxiing was demonstrated at the Le Bourget Air Show
in June 2013, and led to an agreement being signed with Air France
to develop the system. In December 2013, an agreement was.
signed with Airbus to assess electric green taxiing as a new option
for A320 aircraft.

@ Filters

In 2013, Safran was selected to supply fuel filters for CFM56
engines in aircraft operated by US-based airlines US Airways and
Southwest Airlines.

Engine systems and equipment

1 Nacelles and thrust reversers

In 2018, Safran delivered a total of 513 thrust reversers for the A820
and 166 thrust reversers for the A330 (489 and 146, respectively,
in 2012). As in 2012, a total of 108 nacelles were delivered for
the A380.

Another decisive advance was recorded in 2013 for the LEAP-1C
nacelles to be used in China’s future C919 aircraft, with the launch
of production for the first thrust reverser parts. The LEAP-1A nacelle
designed for the A320neo is developing as planned.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IN 2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2014

COMMENTS ON THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2013 BASED ON ADJUSTED DATA

Safran is also involved in three nacelle development projects in the
business aviation sector: Silvercrest, Learjet 85, and Passport on
behalf of GE for the Bombardier Global 7000/8000. The Learjet85
nacelle was unveiled to the public at the US business aviation
(NBAA) show in Las Vegas.

Services

Safran reported a 10% rise in business related to nacelle services.
In 2013, it opened a parts distribution center in Beijing to serve
Chinese airlines that operate aircraft with the Company's jet engine
nacelle and thrust reverser products. This new facility will provide
spare parts and inventory management for airline companies, with
rapid response capability for urgent aircraft-on-ground service
requirements. The distribution facility builds on Aircelle’s already
well-established presence in China, which includes an office in
Beijing, along with a network of customer support managers and
field service representatives.

In 2013, Safran was also selected to provide systematic preventive
maintenance for Trent 700 thrust reversers installed on 50 A330s
operated by Cathay Pacific and its subsidiary Dragonair. Safran
landed this ten-year contract amid fierce competition, and its
success confirms the development of the systematic preventive
maintenance model for thrust reversers and nacelles, which have
traditionally been repaired as and when needed.

@ Mechanical power transmissions

Throughout 2013, Safran continued to develop power transmission
for the Trent XWB engines used in the A350 as well as for
LEAP engines. During the year Safran delivered the first power
transmission gearbox for initial flight testing of the LEAP-1C engine
that will power the Chinese aircraft COMAC C919.

Electrical systems and engineering

@ Power generation and distribution systems

Safran can call on its engineering and research teams to develop
cutting-edge electrical solutions for all the energy needs of an
aircraft. Compared to the current architecture combining electrical,
hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical networks, the “more
electric” aircraft offers optimum performance, superior reliability,
a lighter carbon footprint and significantly lower production and
maintenance costs.

Driven by its ambition to continue developing in this critical
aerospace segment, in 2013 Safran finalized its acquisition of
Goodrich Electrical Power Systems (GEPS) and in January 2014
announced that it was to create a new industrial division for the

Group's electrical power activities, Labinal Power Systems. This
operating division, which will soon include the power distribution
solutions of Eaton Aerospace (the acquisition should be completed
in the first half of 2014), covers the entire electrical energy chain
and places Safran in a strong position to continue its successful
breakthrough in the expanding market for “more electric aircraft".
This transaction has enabled the Group to create a world leader in
electrical and power transmission systems.

® Electrical interconnection systems

Confirming its front-ranking role as engine and parts manufacturer
for Dassault's Falcon 5X, Safran was also selected to provide the
wiring harnesses for this new aircraft.

® Ventilation systems and electrical engines

In 2013, the Company received the CCAR145 maintenance
certificate from the Chinese civil aviation authorities. This allows it
to repair all equipment fitted to aircraft registered in China.

For the past 11 years, Technofan has ranked amongst the top
ten companies in Airbus’ Annual Supplier Support Rating,
demonstrating its superior customer service quality.

@ Engineering services

Safran Servicos de Supporte de Programas Aeronauticas Ltda
(SAR), the Group's new Brazilian entity based in Sao José dos
Campos (Sao Paulo state), opened for business in May 2013 and
includes a new business center for Safran Engineering Services.
Safran Engineering Services provides expertise in electrical systems,
aerostructure, mechanical systems, avionics and electronic
embedded systems. The business has landed major engineering
contracts with Embraer and Helibras. A joint venture was set up
by SAR with a Brazilian partner to provide engineering services for
Embraer’s new range of EJets E2 regional jets. Safran Engineering
Services also helps to develop Safran’s local Aircraft Equipment
programs with Brazilian customers. Safran Engineering Services
has been part of Labinal Power Systems since January 2, 2014.

Other equipment

@ Small electric motors

In October 2013, Safran completed the disposal of Globe Motors Inc.,
a US-based subsidiary, to Allied Motors Inc. Globe Motors designs,
manufactures and distributes precision motors and motorized
devices for the automotive, aerospace and weapons industries
and had revenue of USD 106 million in 2012.

REVIEW OF DEFENCE OPERATIONS IN 2013

Full-year 2013 revenue was down 2.8% at €1,278 million, or down
2.2% on an organic basis, compared to the previous year. Avionics
revenue grew on the back of higher deliveries of seeker kit modules
and a solid flight control systems activity. This trend was offset by
softer revenue in optronics due primarily to the continued decline in
shipments of long-range infra-red goggles to the US Armed Forces.
Against this backdrop, Safran continued to leverage its leadership
in cutting-edge technologies in optronics: Optrolead (50/50 joint
venture between Safran and Thales) signed an upstream study
program (PEA) for the development of a fourth generation of
airborne electro-optical gyrostabilized systems.

Full-year 2013 recurring operating income at €87 million (6.8%
of revenue) was up 10.1% (up 3.8% organically) compared to
€79 million (6.0% of revenue) in full-year 2012. The continued
turnaround of profitability in avionics resulted from a combination
of favorable volume, price and mix effect and cost reductions.
Optronics continued to deliver satisfactory profits, although lower
than last year, thanks to continued deliveries of the FELIN infantry
combat system and the first maintenance and upgrade activity
on the French Army's FELIN equipment. Budgetary constraints
impacted FELIN requirements at the French Ministry of Defence.
Consequently, OE deliveries will cease after 2014 instead of after
2015 as initially expected. However, export potential for soldier
modernization programs remains strong.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Optronics

@ Modernizing infantry

In 2013, Safran delivered the modern FELIN infantry combat
system to four regiments of the French Army, with 14 regiments
now outfitted and the system covering all specialist areas of
the infantry. The 2014 French Military Planning Act provides for
a reduction in deliveries equivalent to 3.5 regiments out of the
21 initially planned. Safran also provides support for the systems
delivered and used in active service. Together with the French
Directorate General of Weapons Procurement (hereafter “DGA"),
the Group is also considering the changes to be made to future
FELIN models in light of the feedback received on the ground. The
RIF-NG new generation soldier information network development
by Safran and now accredited by the DGA is the first dynamic
soldier information network in Europe. FELIN continues to attract
interest outside France, with talks underway with Benelux, Canada,
Algeria and Russia, for example. Good feedback from its use in
overseas operations should further cement its reputation.

®@ Portable optronic equipment, sight equipment and drones
Portable optronic equipment

The string of commercial successes in portable optronics this year
confirms the front-ranking position of Safran technology, despite an
overall decline in the market prompted by the withdrawal of armed
forces from certain overseas military operations and by cuts in the
defence budget in most developed countries. New orders will bring
the number of JIM-LR multifunction goggles in service and on order
across the globe to over 6,000 (UN, the US, Algeria, etc.)

In France, Safran received confirmation that the two conditional
tranches of the JIRTTANG contract to deliver several hundred
new-generation infrared goggles would go ahead.

Throughout the year Safran, via its subsidiary Vectronix, supplied
various countries (Israel, Norway, etc.) with laser range finder (LRF)
modules and took part in the program to modernize Bundeswehr
infantry with the supply of Moskito and Vector rangefinders.

Optovac MecAnica e Optoelectrénica Ltda, a Brazilian subsidiary
created in 2012 and specializing in optronics and night vision,
continued to grow in 2013 and began to operate out of the Univap
Technology Park in San Jose dos Campos. The many solutions
offered to its Brazilian customers demonstrates how Optovac is
increasing its exposure and activity in the country.

Onboard optronic equipment

Sagem landed a major contract with DCNS to deliver EOMS-NG
(Electro-Optical Multifunction System — New Generation) systems

‘that will be installed on four French navy amphibious and projection
vessels: three Mistral-class projection and command (BPC) ships
and the Siroco TCD landing craft transport vessel. The EOMS-
NG provides day and night vision and offers 360° surveillance,
identification, tracking and target engagement functionalities.

In the periscope business, Sagem outfitted five DCNS submarines
with ten optronic surveillance masts for the Brazilian, Indian and
French navies.

In the segment of gyrostabilized observation systems, Sagem
received a large order from its partner Airbus Helicopters for Euroflir
optronics systems in connection with several export contracts
(Chile, Uzbekistan, etc.).

Through Optrolead, its joint venture with Thales, Safran takes an
active role in the upstream study program for new-generation
airborne gyrostabilized pods featuring numerous sensors, which
offer industry-beating performances at equal mass and volumes
to existing systems.

In the field of cameras for land-based applications, the SATIS
device featuring a high-resolution detector made good progress
in 2013. Technical advances also helped drive development and
enabled the Group to start marketing its multi-function viewfinders
for PASEO land platforms. On a commercial front, the progress of
these programs and stronger decisive partnerships with foreign
companies spell good news for export opportunities going forward.

Drones

The DGA confirmed its order for five SDTI tactical drones to round
out its existing in-service capabilities.

Safran also continued to provide SDTI drone support services for
the French Armed Forces throughout 2013.

During the year, Safran carried out an additional series of flight tests
of its new Patroller™ tactical drone in multi-mission configuration,
incorporating a communications intelligence (COMINT) system. The
positioning capabilities of the drone are attracting growing interest
from export customers.

Avionics

®@ Navigation systems and sensors

In 2013 Safran continued to benefit from the investments made in
this high-tech industry in previous years.

On a commercial front, 2013 saw the first major orders for the
BlueNaute attitude and heading reference system, in particular from
a US hydrographic vessel and the Indonesian Coast Guard.

Also in the shipbuilding field, Safran was chosen by the DGA to
modernize the inertial navigation and alignment system on the
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IN 2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2014

COMMENTS ON THE GROUP'’S PERFORMANCE IN 2013 BASED ON ADJUSTED DATA

In the aerospace field, 2013 was defined by several success stories
demonstrating Safran’s excellence in navigation:

e the 10,000th aircraft piloting reference sensor (APIRS) was
delivered: APIRS are today fitted to a large number of civil
airplanes, including Bombardier's Dash 8, Casa 295 and ATR72,
Airbus Helicopters’ EC135/145/155/225 and NH Industries’
NHg0;

«Indian airframe manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL)
ordered more than 100 Sigma 95 navigation systems for the
Indian Air Force;

e Thales Alenia Space ordered Regys 20 3-axis gyros for its
satellite applications. Regys 20 is made using the latest
hemospherical resonator gyro (HRG) technology.

In 2013, Safran ran the first flight tests of its HRG-based navigation
system prototype on an Airbus A320. This new, innovative
technology yielded excellent results.

In cockpit avionics, Dallas-based Sagem Avionics Inc. in the
US supplied several helicopter operators with its multifunction
Integrated Cockpit Display System (ICDS). The display suite is an
intuitive and particularly user-friendly system that is very popular
among helicopter crews.

Safran, the European leader in navigation systems, acquired the
Swiss company Colibrys SA in January 2013. Colibrys has around
70 employees and is specialized in the design and production
of high-performance micro-sensors based on silicon MEMS"
technology. Through this acquisition, Safran expands its range
of technological expertise, particularly in inertial sensors and
accelerometers.

™@ Seekers and guidance systems

Safran's AASM Modular air-to-ground weapons system confirmed
its excellent performance capabilities, particularly during operations
in Mali. Following the successful completion of firing tests for the
new laser-guided missile on the Rafale, Safran received an order
for over 200 AASM suites from the DGA.

Building on its expertise in weapons guidance systems, Safran
was selected to supply infrared seekers for MMP medium-range
missiles for the Army and FASGW®' light anti-ship missiles as part of
a joint project with the British. Safran was also chosen by the DGA
to conduct a design study contract for inertial navigation systems.
for new-generation tactical missiles.

(1) Micro Electro Mechanical Systems.
(2) Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon.

@ Flight control systems

Several important events occurred in 2013 in the field of electric
flight control systems:

° Safran was chosen by Bell Helicopter to supply certain actuators
for the B525;

e the horizontal stabilizer trim system which Safran is producing
for Embraer’s KC 390 program continued to develop;

e the Detail Design Review (DDR) phase was completed and the
first simulation bays for the nacelle’s electrical thrust reverser
actuation system (ETRAS) on the C919 were delivered to
COMAC.

Safran also worked on projects for a more electric helicopter,
proposing a fly-by-wire flight control system featuring a sidestick,
an altitude and heading reference system and quadruplex flight
computers.

@ Onboard information systems/data management

In 2013, Safran leveraged synergies between two of its subsidiaries,
Snecma and Sagem, to offer airline companies an innovative
service allowing them to optimize operating costs. The use of flight
data combined with an onboard information system (Cassiopée)
allows Safran to provide a responsive, flexible solution and reduce
aircraft consumption.

Electronics and critical software

Fadec Alliance Inc., a joint venture set up by GE Aviation and Fadec
International (itself a joint venture between Sagem and BAE) is to
supply next-generation Fadec 4 devices to be fitted to the LEAP
and Passport engines. In 2013, Fadec 4 successfully completed
several milestones enabling the first engine rotations for CFM's
LEAP and GE's Passport.

Also in the year, Fadec International celebrated its successful
10-year partnership, which has seen it deliver over 9,900 engine
control systems representing more than 600 million flying hours.

Numerous in-progress projects have also successfully completed

important milestones:

the first functional tests for the A350’s remote braking control
units were completed;

e the Detail Design Review (DDR) phase was completed on the
brake control system for Embraer’s KC390.

Aerospace Embedded Solutions GmbH (AES), a joint venture set

up in 2012 by Safran and MTU in Germany, delivered the first series

engine control software for the A400M Atlas.

% of business line revenue

Sector 2012

Identification 63% 62%
E-documents 22% 22%
Detection 15% 16%

REVIEW OF SECURITY OPERATIONS IN 2013

The Security activity reported full-year 2013 revenue of
€1,502 million, down 2.8% compared to the year-ago period.
Stable revenue on an organic basis reflects a mixed situation in
identification, slow growth in detection and stability in e-documents.
In identification, MorphoTrust continued its robust growth,
driven by US Federal activities. A tough market for Morpho’s
biometric activities (excluding MorphoTrust) offset this growth as
governmental contracts were subject to budgetary constraints or

political instability. The e-documents activity has been significantly
impacted in its smartchip telco and banking segments due to
intensified price pressure and late introduction of NFC technology.
Nevertheless, Safran regained traction in the telco and banking
market as deliveries of NFC and LTE technology-enabled devices
commenced. Detection ended 2013 with strong momentum,
notably delivering CTX tomographic detection systems to the TSA.
(US), CATSA (Canada) and other export markets.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IN 2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2014

COMMENTS ON THE GROUP'’S PERFORMANCE IN 2013 BASED ON ADJUSTED DATA

Full-year 2013 recurring operating income decreased by 17.2%
to €120 million compared to €145 million in the year-ago period.
The decline is principally due to the run-off of a few biometric
identification projects which had been profitable in their latter years,
not yet offset by new contracts. In e-documents, cost reductions
did not entirely offset margin declines due to pricing pressure.
Detection margins improved on higher CTX volumes.

Management and organizational changes in the second half of
2013 will result in the adaptation of the cost base and refocusing
resources on significant growth prospects characteristic of the
Security business.

In March 2013, Safran divested part of its stake in Ingenico,
generating around €130 million in profit after tax. Safran nevertheless
remains a major shareholder of the company, with 10.2% of its
capital and around 17% of its voting rights.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Identification systems

® Major identity management systems

In the US, Safran is the leading supplier of identity management
solutions, with its system for issuing driving licenses currently
used in 42 of 50 states. Several states (Arizona, Illinois, Alabama,
Connecticut) renewed their commitment to Safran in 2013 for the
replacement and upgrade of their driving license issuance systems.
Safran also provides biometric identification solutions to the FBI,
the Department of Defense and the State Department. In 2013,
Safran became the first operator to be awarded the highest security
certification by the North American Security Product Organization
(NASPO) for a facility that produces driving licenses and ID cards.

In Albania, the concession awarded in 2008 to manage the
entire production process (enrollment, personalization, issue and
distribution) of secure biometric identity cards and passports was.
renewed for a further ten years and extended to include a platform
giving access to e-Services in order to help improve and make
safer public and private transactions carried out online by Albanian
citizens.

In Egypt, the one-millionth identity card was issued in March under
the country’s new (color) ID system.

In Mali, Safran supplied and personalized — within an extremely
short timeframe — seven million electoral ID cards used in the
July and August presidential elections.

India’s Unique Identification Authority (UIDAI) had delivered
over 500 million unique identification numbers at the end of
December from its Aadhaar biometric system which uses Morpho
technology. Following on from the Aadhaar project, alternate usages
have been confirmed for the technology, in particular biometric
identification for the banking industry.

@ Border control

Following orders for gates and kiosks for Perth, Sydney and
Brisbane airports as part of the Australian border control system,
tests of the latest generation automated border control solution,
SmartGate Plus, were successfully completed in actual operating
conditions at Auckland airport in New Zealand.

® Criminal identification

Building on its long-standing relationship, in 2013 Safran entered
into a strategic partnership to supply Interpol with a range of
innovative biometric solutions and other technical support to
enhance international security. Under the five-year partnership,
Safran's cutting-edge facial recognition technology will also be
provided to Interpol. The two organizations, along with other key
partners, will also collaborate on developing global standards and
best practices.

The latest improvements to the FBI's new-generation identification
solutions have made searches using digital fingerprints far more
effective and further increased the rate of crimes solved. Boasting
enhanced capacity, speed and accuracy for comparing fingerprints
and other prints left at crime scenes, the system meets the public
security needs of over 18,000 police, government, tribal and federal
organizations across the country.

Police forces in several US states including Missouri and Arizona
are using Morpho!Dent, a portable fingerprint device which can now
be used to make simultaneous searches in several AFIS systems
regardless of the system provider, thanks to a software platform that
can interface with local, federal, or central AFIS systems.

The US Department of Defense has chosen Safran to provide
maintenance services for the platform used as its main biometric
identification system, while the French Interior Ministry has renewed
its contract for Safran to provide maintenance services for the
FAED"! system used by French police.

® Biometric enrollment services

Biometric enrollment is particularly developed in the US and Safran
provides enrollment services through various representative offices
throughout the country. Enrollment records user's biometric and
biographical data and performs background checks and other ID
services. Biometric enrollment is used to deliver accreditations and
access documents meeting the security requirements demanded
by the partners concerned. These can be national (e.g., the TSA®))
or local government bodies.

In 2013, Safran announced that it had enrolled 1.5 million drivers
in the year as part of TSA’s Hazardous Materials Endorsement
Threat Assessment Program (HTAP). This program is in the final
phase of integration within the TSA’s Unique Enrollment Service
featuring all enrollment and registration functions introduced by

(1) Automated Fingerprint Identification System (Fichier automatisé des empreintes aigitales).

(2) Transportation Security Administration.

the TSA in order to verify biometric and background data for
individuals seeking access to critical premises or segments of the
transportation system.

@ Biometric equipment

Safran is the world’s first company to achieve Common Criteria
certification" for fingerprint spoof detection in a biometric device:
the MorphoSmartTM Optic 301 fingerprint reader was certified by
an independent German certification body and means that the
device meets the industry's highest standards for spoof detection.

In 2013, Safran also launched its IAD™ (lris-at-a-Distance)
technology, which can simultaneously capture the iris and face of
aperson at a distance of one meter in just one second. Combining
iris and face capture, IAD is suited to a wide range of applications
requiring fast and accurate imaging technology such as border
and access control.

™@ Other businesses

In 2013, the first ELITE games terminals began to be rolled out
for La Frangaise des Jeux. These latest-generation terminals use
new on-the-fly imaging technology, making them easy to use and
increasing bulletin design possibilities.

E-documents

Buoyed by the acquisitions carried out in December 2012, Safran
strengthened its positions on the banking market in Europe, where
the business grew 60% in value terms over the year. The migration
from stripe cards to smart cards in line with the Europay MasterCard
Visa (EMV) standard and the growing trend towards Dual Interface
Contactless/Contact technology in Western Europe continued to
drive growth in the banking market, even though the pace of growth
has slowed in certain regions such as Brazil which has completed
the migration. The sharp fall in the value of the Brazilian real and
Indian rupee had a significant impact on the business's performance
in euro terms.

In the telecoms market, the roll-out of LTE (4G) technology —
particularly in North America — and the significant inroads made by a
large South American telecoms group spurred considerable growth
in value terms in the Americas region, despite the adverse currency
impact. India saw a sharp decline in value terms prompted by
regulatory changes affecting telecoms operators as from end-2012
and by the depreciation of the rupee. However, Safran increased
its market share and strengthened its leadership on this market.
Business in other regions remained stable overall, amid fierce
downward pressure on prices and a lower-than-expected roll-out
of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.

At the beginning of 2013, Orange and Safran created the world’s
first mobile identity management system for the healthcare sector.
This healthcare data mobility system enables doctors to securely
access patient files via a tablet or mobile device using strong SIM
authentication.

December saw the launch of mobile payment solutions using
Samsung smartphones by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia
in partnership with Mastercard. Safran's Trusted Services
Management (TSM) technology means that the mobiles can be
personalized remotely and used for secure contactless payments.

Detection

®@ Tomography and diffraction-based detection systems

The high-throughput CTX 9800 device was chosen for in-hold
baggage screening at Japan's Narita airport, which acquired 13
of the new systems, bringing the number of devices installed at
Narita to around 40.

Similarly, the Nice-Céte d'Azur airport in France, where four of these
devices came into service in 2013, became the first airport in the
continental EU to screen all passenger checked baggage — referred
to as Level 1 screening — with an advanced explosives detection
system (EDS).

The US TSA had already chosen CTX 9800 in 2012. In 2013,
it also awarded Safran a contract to provide reduced-size
CTX 5800 explosives detection devices for a fixed price of up to
USD 130 million over the next five years.

In Canada, CATSA®! also ordered these two devices under a
five-year fixed-price contract worth up to USD 100 million. Safran
delivered 20 systems to CATSA in 2013.

@ Spectrometry-based trace detection equipment

Over 200 Itemiser® DX explosives trace detectors (ETD) were
deployed by global air carriers in 2013 to meet new regulatory
mandates for enhanced cargo screening. Early in the year Morpho
Detection launched an online store where US customers can directly
order consumables to optimize the maintenance and operation of
their trade detection systems.

Infraero, Brazil's national airport operator, has selected Safran’s
desktop explosives trace detection system, the Itemiser DX.
Ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games,
the Itemiser DX provides Infraero with the highest level of passenger
and baggage screening security across Brazilian airports.

(1) The data published for 2012 have been restated to reflect the impact of the change in accounting policy resulting from the retrospective application of the amended

JAS 19, Employee Benefits (see section 3.1, Note 3).

Consolidated revenue

Recurring operating income

Consolidated revenue climbed 6.4% year-on-year, to €14,490 million
from €13,615 million in 2012.

The difference between adjusted revenue and consolidated revenue
is due to the exclusion of foreign currency derivatives from the
adjusted figures. Neutralizing the impact of foreign currency
hedging decreased consolidated revenue in 2013 by €205 million
while it increased consolidated revenue by €55 million in 2012.
This year-on-year change in the revenue impact of foreign currency
hedging results from movements in average exchange rates with
regard to the effective hedged rates for the period on the portion
of foreign currency denominated flows hedged by the Group. For
example, the hedged EUR/USD rate in 2013 was 1.28, against an
annual average rate of 1.33, which explains why netting out the
effect of foreign currency hedging gives a consolidated revenue
figure that is lower than adjusted consolidated revenue.

Year-on-year changes in revenue excluding the impact of adjusting
items are analyzed below (see section 2.1.2).

Recurring operating income rose 4.2% to €1,295 million in 2013
from €1,243 million in 2012. The difference between recurring
operating income and adjusted recurring operating income, which
came in at €1,788 million, reflects:

* amortization charged against intangible assets measured
when allocating the purchase price for business combinations,
representing €150 million versus €156 million in 2012 for
the May 2005 Sagem-Snecma business combination. The
adjustment related to other business combinations includes
amortization charged against intangible assets measured when
allocating the purchase price in the amount of €100 million
(€97 million in 2012) and a cancellation of the impact of inventory
remeasurement in the amount of €27 million;

* anegative €216 million impact resulting from foreign currency
transactions (positive impact of €52 million in 2012).

Changes in recurring operating income, excluding the impact of

adjusting items, are analyzed below (see section 2.1.2).

Profit from operations

Profit from operations came in 24.7% higher at €1,480 million for
the year, compared to €1,187 million in 2012. Profit from operations
includes recurring operating income of €1,295 million in 2013
(€1,243 million in 2012) and non-recurring income of €185 million
(anon-recurring loss of €56 million in 2012). Profit from operations
differs from profit from operations as adjusted (€1,757 million), since
as well as recurring operating items, it also includes a net gain of
€216 million on the remeasurement of the Group's previously-held
interest in the RTM322 project (see Scope of consolidation, section
3.1, Note 4).

Changes in profit from operations based on adjusted figures are
analyzed below along with non-recurring items (see section 2.1.2).

Financial income (loss)

The Group reported financial income of €439 million in 2013 and
€533 million in 2012.

Two items account for the difference between consolidated and
adjusted financial income for 2013 (see section 2.1.2):

* changes in the fair value of currency instruments hedging future
cash flows, which had a positive impact of €374 million in 2013
(€742 million in 2012). This amount is recognized in full in financial
income (loss) in the consolidated financial statements. However,
the impact of changes in financial instruments hedging future
cash flows is neutralized in the adjusted financial statements;

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IN 2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2014
COMMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

e the net positive impact of foreign currency hedging on the
portion of foreign exchange denominated flows hedged by
the Group, totaling €203 million in 2013 (net negative impact
of €55 million in 2012). This impact is recognized in financial
income (loss) in the consolidated financial statements, but within
profit from operations (mostly in revenue) in the adjusted income
statement.

Income tax expense

Income tax expense in full-year 2013 came in at €650 million
compared to €433 million in 2012. The increase in this caption
chiefly results from the €199 million rise in profit before tax between
2012 and 2013 which itself results from growth in the Group's
business (increase of €293 million in profit from operations — see
section 2.1.2).

The increase in income tax expense is also related to an increase in
the corporate income tax rate introduced by the amending French
Finance Law (Loi de finances rectificative) for 2013 (adopted in
late 2013) and to the 3% tax on dividend payouts introduced by
the amending French Finance Law for 2012 which is recognized
in income tax expense in the year in which dividends are paid.

Consolidated profit attributable to owners

Cash flow from operations is calculated by taking profit or loss
before tax and adjusting for income and expenses with no cash
impact, for example net charges to depreciation, amortization and
provisions and changes in the fair value of financial instruments
hedging future cash flows”. The Group's ability to finance working
capital needs, acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets and dividends out of operating activities rose
by €282 million over the year, from €1,702 million in 2012 to
€1,984 million in 2013.

Operations generated €712 million of free cash flow (40% of adjusted
recurring operating income in 2013), €148 million more than in 2012.
The net debt position was €1,089 million at December 31, 2013
compared to €932 million at December 31, 2012.

Free cash flow generation of €712 million results from cash from
operations of €1,984 million, a decrease in working capital needs of
€155 million — obtained despite the rise in production volumes — and
rising R&D and capital expenditure in preparation for future growth.
During the year there had been some uncertainty on year-end free

cash flow. However, continuous and consistent management of
working capital needs and low customer payment delays at year-
end contributed to a satisfactory level of cash generation.

Dividends paid in the year include the final dividend payment of
€0.65 per share in respect of 2012 and an interim dividend of
€0.48 per share in respect of 2013, representing a total payout
of €471 million.

Acquisitions of securities relate mainly to the acquisition of Goodrich
Electrical Power Systems for €301 million, and to the acquisition of
Rolls-Royce's 50% stake in the RTM322 program (previously jointly
held with Group subsidiary Turbomeca) for €293 million. Safran’s
sale of 6.6 million Ingenico shares brought proceeds of €287 million,
and the disposal of Globe Motors Inc. was completed for a cash
consideration of €68 million.

As of December 31, 2013, Safran had cash and cash equivalents
of €1.7 billion and €2.55 billion of secured and undrawn facilities
available.

2 ) REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IN 2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2014
COMMENTS ON THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Safran SA reported financial income of €473 million in 2013 and
€732 million in 2012. This figure mainly includes dividends received
from subsidiaries for €502 million (€574 million in 2012), net interest
expense of €4 million (net interest income of €39 million in 2012),
foreign exchange losses amounting to €21 million (foreign exchange
gains of €72 million in 2012), and net additions to provisions for
impairment of financial assets or exchange losses totaling €5 million
(net reversals of €47 million in 2012).

The Company reported a non-recurring loss of €26 million in 2013
and €5 million in 2012, due mainly to the net €21 million impact
of accelerated depreciation and amortization charged against
non-current assets.

The income tax line represented a benefit of €50 million under the
Group's tax consolidation regime (benefit of €191 million in 2012,
resulting mainly from the merger of Sagem Télécommunications
into Safran). This benefit also includes a net charge to the provision
for the transfer of the tax saving relating to the French tax group
from Safran SA to its loss-making subsidiaries, in an amount of
€10 million.

On account of the above, profit for the year came in at €328 million,
compared to €765 million in 2012.

2.3.2 SAFRAN SA SIMPLIFIED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2013

(in € millions) Dec. 31, 2012
Assets

Non-current assets 9,462 9,843,
Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 1,861 1,359
Other current assets 2,144 2,157
TOTAL ASSETS 13,467 13,359
Equity and liabilities

Share capital 5,758 5,636
Provisions 677 707
Borrowings 2,814 2,565
Other payables. 4,218 4,451
TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 13,467 13,359

The decrease in share capital reflects profit for the year of
€328 million, dividends paid in 2013 for a total of €471 million
(€271 million for the remaining 2012 dividend balance and
€200 million in 2013 interim dividends paid in December 2013),
and a net charge to tax-driven provisions amounting to €21 million.

The increase in non-current assets primarily results from
subscriptions to the share capital increase carried out at (i) Safran
Power UK in relation to the acquisition of Goodrich Electrical
Power Systems (€275 million), and (ii) Safran USA (€60 million).

The increase in this caption also results from having subscribed to
the share capital of Aerofund III in an amount of €30 million.

Net cash from operating activities came in at €604 million. The
net cash position (cash and cash equivalents less borrowings and
debt) was affected by the share capital increase at several foreign
subsidiaries for €335 million, and by the €248 million decrease in
borrowings — mainly in the form of commercial paper.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS IN 2013 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2014 @

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

2.4 OUTLOOK FOR 2014

Safran expects on a full-year basis:
* adjusted revenue to increase by a percentage rate in the mid-

single digits compared to 2013 revenue restated for IFRS 11 (at
an estimated average rate of USD 1.30 to the euro);

* adjusted recurring operating income to increase by low double
digits compared to 2013 recurring operating income restated
for IFRS 11 (at a hedged rate of USD 1.26 to the euro);

° free cash flow to represent close to 40% of adjusted recurring
operating income, subject to usual uncertainties on the timing
of advance payments.

The full-year 2014 outlook is based on the following underlying

assumptions:

* restatements of slightly more than (€300) million to 2013 revenue
and slightly less than (€10) million to 2013 adjusted recurring
operating income related to IFRS 11;

° healthy increase in Aerospace OE deliveries;

° civil aftermarket increase by a percentage in the low to mid-
teens;

stable level of self-funded R&D with a lower level of capitalization
compared to 2013;

¢ stable level of tangible capex;
* profitable growth for the Security business;

* continued benefits from the ongoing Safran+ plan to enhance
the cost structure and reduce overheads.

Factors with a potential impact on results

Major risk factors that could have an adverse impact on the Group's
business, financial position or results of operations are described
in section 4.

2.5 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Acquisition of Eaton Aerospace’s Power
Distribution and Integrated Cockpit Solutions
business

On January 20, 2014, Safran announced that it had signed a
definitive agreement to acquire the Aerospace Power Distribution
Management Solutions and Integrated Cockpit Solutions business
of Eaton.

The acquisition of the Aerospace Power Distribution Management
Solutions business brings key contactor and circuit breaker
technologies to Safran. As the continuation of Safran’s strategy

addressing the market for “more electric aircraft”, it reinforces
Labinal Power Systems, which consolidates the Group's electrical
power activities.

The acquisition of the Integrated Cockpit Solutions business allows
Safran to bolster Sagem's offering and North-American presence in
avionics and flight controls, bringing recognized expertise in panels
and displays, including illuminated switches and cockpit controls.
The transaction, which is expected to close in the first half of

2014, is subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions.
