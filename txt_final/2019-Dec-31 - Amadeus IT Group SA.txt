Net financial debt* was €2,758.4 million at December 31, 2019 (1.23 times last-twelve-month EBITDA’).

Amadeus ended the year with a positive evolution through the fourth quarter, delivering 2019, Revenue,
EBITDA and Adjusted Profit growth of 12.8%*, 10.0%’, and 13.4%’, respectively. This positive evolution was
supported by the operating performances of our Distribution and IT Solutions segments, TravelClick’s
acquisition (acquired on October 4, 2018) and positive foreign exchange effects. Our performance took place
in the context of a sound financial structure, with leverage closing at 1.23 times last-twelve month EBITDA,
supported by free cash flow generation of €1,044.8 million?, a 8.1% pre-tax increase relative to 2018.

In Distribution, during the fourth quarter of 2019 we continued to secure and expand content for our
subscribers by renewing or signing content agreements with 17 carriers, reaching a total of 47 in the year
2019. In January 2020, we announced a new distribution agreement with Air India resulting from which travel
sellers in India will have access to the airline’s international content, while travel sellers in the rest of the world
will have access to the full range of Air India’s content, both domestic and international. Also, in February
2020, we announced that Japan Airlines will implement Amadeus Altéa NDC and integrate its NDC content
into the Amadeus Travel Platform.

Despite a weak industry this year, in 2019, our Distribution travel agency bookings grew by 0.5%, of which,
our TA air bookings remained flat relative to 2018. Excluding India, Amadeus TA air bookings grew 2.7%. Our
volume growth was supported by an enhancement in our global competitive position? expanding by 0.3 p.p.
(by 1.0 p.p. excluding India). In 2019, Amadeus had market share gains across regions, with the exception of
Asia-Pacific. In Asia-Pacific, in December 2018, Air India cancelled its distribution agreement with Amadeus
and, in April 2019, Jet Airways ceased operations. In 2019, Distribution revenue grew 4.2%, supported by
volume growth, average revenue per booking expansion, double-digit growth in Payments Distribution and
positive foreign exchange effects.

IT Solutions revenue grew 26.2%! in 2019. This evolution was driven by (i) high single-digit growth in Airline
IT solutions, (ii) a continued expansion in our new businesses, delivering double-digit revenue growth, (iii) the
consolidation of TravelClick and (iv) positive foreign exchange effects. Our Passengers Boarded increased by
8.9% in the quarter and by 7.5% in the year. This growth was driven by (i) customer implementations
(including S7 Airlines, Maldivian Airlines, Cyprus Airways and Aeromar in 2018, as well as, Philippine Airlines,
Bangkok Airways, Flybe, Air Canada and Air Europa in 2019) and (ii) organic growth of 6.4%. Passengers
Boarded growth in 2019 was negatively impacted by the de-migration of LATAM Airlines Brasil from our
platform during the second quarter of 2018. Our Airline IT business was also impacted by an unsually high
number of airline bankruptcies taking place in 2019, such as Germania, bmi Regional, Avianca Brasil, Avianca
Argentina, Thomas Cook UK, Aigle Azur, Adria Airways and XL Airways France. Excluding these airline
customers ceasing or suspending operations (which combined had approximately 30 million passengers
boarded annually), our Passengers Boarded growth was 10.5% in the fourth quarter and 8.5% in the year.

During the fourth quarter, Air Canada completed its migration to the Altéa Reservations and Inventory
modules and also implemented Amadeus Anytime Merchandizing and Amadeus Customer Experience
Management. Our Airline IT customer base continued to expand. TAAG Angola signed for the full Altéa suite
and Amadeus Revenue Integrity. Norwegian signed for Amadeus Passenger Recovery. Korean Air contracted
for some of our disruption related solutions. Chinese carriers Sichuan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines, both,
signed for additional functionality within our Digital suite and SriLankan Airlines contracted for Amadeus
Group Manager. Russian carrier S7 Airlines contracted and implemented Amadeus Loyalty. Fiji Airways
contracted for Amadeus Revenue Management, Amadeus Revenue Accounting and Amadeus Revenue
Integrity, among others.

We also continued to expand our customer bases in our non-air businesses. In Hospitality, U.S. hotel chain
Coast Hotels contracted TravelClick’s iHotelier and business intelligence solutions. Welk Resorts Group and
hotel St Giles London contracted for Single Media Agency. World Trade Center Boston & Seaport Hotel as
well as, the Australian chain Crown hotels, renewed and implemented the most advanced Amadeus Sales &
Event Management solution.

During the quarter, in Airport IT, Perth Airport, a customer of Amadeus Airport Common Use Service since
2015, signed for ICM’s Hybrid Auto Bag Drop units and check-in kiosks, along with ICM’s local platform to
serve the kiosks. Perth airport will also implement Amadeus Passenger Verification. We continued to grow
our footprint in the U.S. Nashville International Airport (Tennessee), Daytona Beach International Airport
(Florida) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (Florida) contracted for our solutions.

A sustained and consistent investment in technology has been key to our success. In 2019, our investment in
R&D amounted to 17.3% of revenue. It was dedicated to supporting our mid to long-term growth, through:
portfolio expansion and new customer implementations; our internal digitalization and transformational
projects to better integrate newly acquired businesses and enhance our performance; and additionally, our
system performance optimization and our continued shift to next-generation technologies and cloud
architecture.

Airline IT

At the close of 2019, 216 customers had contracted either of the Amadeus Passenger Service Systems
(Altéa or New Skies) and 208 had implemented them.

Etihad Airways contracted Altéa Departure Control System Flight Management during the first quarter of
2019 to improve productivity, better manage capacity and reduce costs. In July, Azerbaijan Airlines signed
for the full Altéa suite and also for Revenue Management solutions. Also that month, Bangkok Airways
migrated to Altéa. The carrier implemented the Reservation, Inventory, Ticketing and Departure Control
modules.

We have renewed and expanded our longstanding technology partnership with the Lufthansa Group
(LHG). Through this agreement, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Swiss International Air
Lines and Air Dolomiti will continue to rely onthe Altéa Passenger Service System. Eurowings will
continue to rely on New Skies. In addition to the renewed solutions, LHG has contracted an array of new
services which are set to transform the way the airline group serves its customers — both online and at
the airport — including shopping solutions, Amadeus Instant Search (that improves the returns of the
airline’s Search Optimisation Engine (SEO) to convert more” lookers” into” bookers”), Real-time Ticketing
Feed, Amadeus Sales Watcher and Amadeus Airport Companion App (to increase flexibility while dealing
with disruption at the airport).

Our upselling and crosselling efforts continued during last year. In April, All Nipon Airways (ANA)
announced that it had implemented Amadeus Airline Cloud Availability. The carrier is now able to boost
customer conversion because its offers are consistent across all sales channels, while having a cost-
effective way to distribute content dynamically.
Also in April, Qatar Airways signed up for additional functionality to improve its revenue optimization:
Amadeus Altéa Revenue Availability with Active Valuation (RAAV) and Amadeus Altéa Booking
Intelligence. In May, LATAM Airlines Group signed a multi-year agreement to implement two components
of the Amadeus Sky Suite by Optym: SkyMAX and SkySYM, enabling LATAM to optimize their flight
schedules. During the last quarter, Norwegian signed up for Amadeus Passenger Recovery.

In January 2020, Amadeus completed the acquisition of Sky Suite, the airline network planning software
business of Optym. Optym and Amadeus have been partners for more than three years, jointly delivering
solutions to Southwest Airlines, easyJet and LATAM Airlines. The Amadeus Sky Suite will be further
integrated into the Amadeus Airline Platform, including software for network optimization and
simulation, frequency and capacity planning, network planning and forecasting, and a flight scheduling
development platform.

Hospitality

We continued expanding our portfolio of customers in this segment. American hotel chain Coast Hotels
contracted Travelclick’s iHotelier and business intelligence solutions, which will be implemented across
its almost 40 properties.
During the last part of the year, World Trade Center Boston & Seaport Hotel and the Australian chain
Crown hotels and its 7 properties renewed their contract and implemented the most advanced version
of our Amadeus Sales & Event Management solution. This solution helps hotels deliver exciting, engaging
events, underpinned by excellent customer services and operational efficiency. Welk Resorts Group
opted for Single Media Agency for 3 of its properties.

In September, we expanded our strategic alliance with Marriott International. The company will
recommend its more than 7,000 properties across 132 countries and territories to use TravelClick’s Travel
Agent GDS Advertising, Agency360 and Rate360 to drive additional revenue and improve profitability.
We also continue enhancing our hotel content offering through the Amadeus system. In April, we
announced a landmark partnership with Booking.com. Through this agreement, Booking.com’s content
will now be available on the Amadeus Travel Platform, and travel sellers will directly benefit from an

increase of 30% in the accommodation options made available through Amadeus. Travel sellers will be
able to access the new content in the coming months through multiple points of sale including Amadeus
Selling Platform Connect and, for corporate bookers, through Amadeus cytric Travel & Expense.
Additionally we partnered with Agoda, one of the world’s fastest growing online travel agents, to extend
our hospitality content offer. Now, all of Agoda’s pre-paid hotel content, a total of 150,000 properties,
will be available to travel agents through Amadeus at the same price as Agoda’s website.

Airport IT

In 2019, we had important milestones in our Airport IT business. Skyserv, Greece’s leading independent
ground handler, contracted and implemented Altéa Departure Control System for Ground Handlers for
its 37 airports. Following the implementation, Skyserv is now able to manage load control operations
centrally from a single location, allowing greater efficiency and ensuring more punctuality and a better
experience for travelers.
We also grew our footprint in the United States last year, with several customers signing up for Amadeus
Extended Airline System Environment (EASE), including Eagle County Airport (Colorado), Kelowna
International Airport (Canada), South Bend International Airport (Indiana), Santa Barbara Airport
(California) and Daytona International Airport (Florida).
Our upselling efforts in this segment also continued. In December, Perth Airport, a customer of Amadeus’
ACUS since 2015, signed up for ICM’s Hybrid Auto Bag Drop units and check-in kiosks, along with ICM’s
common use self-service platform. The hybrid functionality means passengers can check-in and drop their
bags independently, or the same units can be switched to full-service mode and staffed for conventional
check-in. The airport will also implement Amadeus Passenger Verification.

In June, we completed the acquisition of ICM Airport Technics. ICM, headquartered in Sydney, Australia,
specializes in the provision of passenger automation and self-service bag drop solutions for customers,
principally in Asia-Pacific and Europe.

Rail

In March, Ctrip and Amadeus announced a new distribution agreement through which Ctrip customers
from anywhere in the world will be able to book and pay for tickets from Renfe, the Spanish rail operator,
in their own language and currency.

Also in March, Deutsche Bahn unveiled its new booking engine, developed in partnership with Amadeus,
to enable passengers to book rail journeys across Europe in one place. Thanks to this new engine,
Deustche Bahn’s customers can now buy cross border trips outside of Germany on bahn.de, bahn.com
and via our mobile app DB Navigator.

Payments

In May, we launched Amadeus B2B Wallet Partner Pay in partnership with Elavon and Mastercard. This
new solution allows agencies to pay using an airline branded virtual card, reducing the cost of payments
by up to 70% compared to existing methods. Thai Airways and Swedish travel agency Select Travel were
the pilot customers.

In June, Ypsilon, one of the largest aggregators of low cost carriers (LCC) content, integrated Amadeus’
B2B Wallet Solution within its booking platform to simplify agent payments to LCC. By integrating
Amadeus’ B2B Wallet solution, agents can now automatically generate a virtual card quickly and simply
within the Ypsilon booking flow. Each virtual card is unique to each individual booking making
reconciliation simple whilst reducing fraud.

In October, Sylvain Roy was appointed new Head of Technology, Platforms & Engineering (TPE), replacing
Dietmar Fauser. In his new role, Sylvain will be responsible for delivering consistently stable and reliable
platforms across all of Amadeus’ businesses, with a strong focus on continuing to automate operations
and drive innovation within Amadeus’ cloud-based architecture. Sylvain has joined Amadeus’ Executive
Committee.

In December, Amadeus was once more recognized as a key R&D investor within Europe. According to the
European Commission 2018 Industrial R&D scorecard, Amadeus is the leading investor in R&D within the
travel sector in Europe, and second in the software industry.

2.2 Key ongoing R&D projects

3 Presentation of financial information

The audited consolidated financial statements of Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and subsidiaries are the source to
the financial information included in this document and have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.

Certain amounts and figures included in this report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Any
discrepancies in any tables between the totals and the sums of the amounts listed are due to rounding.

This document includes unaudited Alternative Performance Measures such as EBITDA, operating income, net
financial debt as defined by our credit facility agreements, adjusted profit and their corresponding ratios.
These Alternative Performance Measures have been prepared in accordance with the Guidelines issued by
the European Securities and Markets Authority for regulated information published on or after July 3, 2016.

Segment contribution is defined as the segment revenue less operating costs plus capitalizations directly
allocated to the segment. A reconciliation to EBITDA is included in section 5.3.
EBITDA corresponds to Operating income plus D&A expense. A reconciliation to the financial statements
is included in section 6.1.5.
The reconciliation of Operating income is included in the Group income statement included in section
6.1.
Adjusted profit corresponds to reported profit for the period, after adjusting for: (i) accounting effects
derived from PPA exercises and impairment losses, (ii) non-operating exchange gains (losses), and (iii)
other items, as detailed in section 6.1.8.

Net financial debt as defined by our credit facility agreements is calculated as current and non-current
debt (as per the financial statements), less cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for non-debt items (such
as deferred financing fees, accrued interest and fair value adjustments to an EIB loan). A reconciliation to
the financial statements is included in section 6.2.5.

We believe that these measures provide useful and relevant information to facilitate a better understanding
of the performance of Amadeus and its economic position. These measures are not standard and therefore
may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

When we refer to our competitive position, we take into account our travel agency air bookings in relation to
the travel agency air booking industry, defined as the total volume of travel agency air bookings processed by
the three major global reservation systems (Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport). It excludes air bookings made
directly through airlines’ direct distribution channels (airline offices and websites), single country operators
(primarily in China, Japan, Russia and Turkey), other content aggregators and direct connect applications
between airline systems, travel agencies, corporations and meta-bookers, which together combined
represent an important part of the industry.

3.1 TravelClick acquisition

On October 4, 2018, Amadeus acquired Project Dwight Ultimate Parent Corporation and its group of
companies (“TravelClick”), a U.S.-based leading global provider of technology and business solutions to the
hospitality industry. The acquisition price amounted to USD 1,520 million. The acquisition was 100% debt-

Page 10


--- Page 9 ---

ns of urs) aMaDEUS

financed. On September 18, 2018 Amadeus undertook three Eurobond issues for an aggregate amount of
€1,500 million, which were partly used to finance TravelClick’s acquisition (see section 6.1.1 for more detail).
The acquisition was structured through a USD-denominated intercompany loan, hedged by Amadeus. The
foreign exchange differences of the loan and its hedge impact our non-operating foreign exchange gains and
losses in the Group income statement. The hedging also impacts the non-operating cash flows caption in the
Group cash flow statement.

The results of TravelClick (“TC”) were consolidated into Amadeus’ books from October 4, 2018. TravelClick is
reported, as part of our IT Solutions segment (except for TravelClick’s indirect costs, which have been
allocated to Indirect costs).

As a consequence of TravelClick’s acquisition, the following non-recurring effects have been accounted for in
2019:

TravelClick’s integration related costs, incurred in 2019, amounting to €9.4 million (before taxes), of which
€6.4 million were paid in the period.

Also, acquisition related costs amounting to €8.0 million, which were incurred in the fourth quarter of
2018, were paid in 2019.

A purchase price allocation exercise in relation to the consolidation of TravelClick into Amadeus’ books
was carried out in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a consequence of such PPA exercise, the following effects
(before taxes) arose in 2019: (i) a reduction in revenue and in personnel and other operating expenses
amounting to €7.8 million and €4.3 million, respectively, derived from the adjustment to fair value of
certain operating liabilities, resulting in a negative impact of €3.6 million to EBITDA (the effects on revenue
and other operating expenses from TravelClick’s PPA exercise will not impact 2020); and (ii) an additional
amortization expense of €51.6 million, increasing the total group amortization expense.

TravelClick’s acquisition related effects described above (acquisition related costs and PPA effects) impacted
our group results and cash generation, in particular our IT Solutions and Group revenue, IT Solutions
contribution, Group EBITDA, Operating income, Profit, Adjusted profit, EPS, adjusted EPS and free cash flow
in 2019.

Also, the following non-recurring effects associated with TravelClick’s acquisition were accounted for in 2018
(for full details, see section 3.2 of our 2018 Management Review):

TravelClick’s acquisition and integration related costs, amounting to €19.5 million (before taxes), of which
€4.8 million were paid in 2018.
As a consequence of the TravelClick’s PPA exercise: (i) a reduction in revenue and in personnel and other
operating expenses amounting to €8.2 million and €0.6 million, respectively, resulting in a negative
impact of €7.7 million to EBITDA, and (ii) an additional amortization expense of €12.2 million.
TravelClick’s acquisition financing related fees amounting to €8.2 million, paid in 2018.

For clarification, in the following tables we display (i) Amadeus Group figures, and (ii) Amadeus Group figures
excluding non-recurring effects associated with TravelClick’s acquisition (acquisition related costs, as well as
PPA effects).

3.2 ICM Airport Technics acquisition

On May 31, 2019, Amadeus acquired ICM Group Holding Limited and its group of companies (“ICM”), for
€40.1 million. ICM, headquartered in Sydney, Australia, specializes in the provision of passenger automation
and self-service bag drop solutions for customers, principally in Asia-Pacific and Europe. The ICM results were

consolidated into Amadeus’ books from June 1, 2019.

A purchase price allocation exercise in relation to the consolidation of ICM into Amadeus’ books will be carried

out before the end of the first half of 2020.

4 Main financial risks and hedging policy
4.1 Foreign exchange rate risk

Our reporting currency is the Euro. However, as a result of Amadeus’ global activity and presence, part of our
results are generated in currencies different from the Euro and therefore are impacted by foreign exchange
fluctuations. Similarly, part of our cash inflows and outflows are denominated in non-Euro currencies. As a
consequence, both our results and our cash flows are impacted, either positively or negatively, by foreign
exchange fluctuations.

Exposure to foreign currencies

Our revenue is almost entirely generated either in Euro or in US Dollar (the latter representing 35%-45% of
our total revenue). Revenue generated in currencies other than the Euro or US Dollar is negligible.

In turn, 55%-65% of our operating costs® are denominated in many currencies different from the Euro,
including the US Dollar, which represents 30%-40% of our operating costs. The rest of the foreign currency
operating expenses are denominated in a variety of currencies, GBP, AUD, INR, SGD and THB being the most
significant. A number of these currencies may fluctuate vs. the Euro similarly to the US Dollar - Euro
fluctuations, and the degree of this correlation may vary with time.

Hedging policy

Amadeus’ target is to reduce the volatility generated by foreign exchange fluctuations on its non-Euro
denominated net cash flows. Our hedging strategy is as follows:

To manage our exposure to the US Dollar, we have a natural hedge to our net operating cash flow
generated in US Dollar or US Dollar-correlated currencies through, among others, payments of USD-
denominated debt (when applicable), as well as investments and taxes paid in the U.S. We may enter into
derivative arrangements when this natural hedge is not sufficient to cover our outstanding exposure.
We also hedge a number of currencies, including the GBP, AUD, INR and SEK, for which we enter into
foreign exchange derivatives with banks.

When the hedges in place covering operating flows qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS, profits and losses
are recognized within EBITDA. Our hedging arrangements typically qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS.

Given that 35-45% of our net free cash flow is generated in USD or currencies that fluctuate vs. the Euro
similarly to the US Dollar-Euro fluctuations, and that our hedging policy targets to reduce cash volatility, our
hedging results are generally insufficient to mitigate the impacts from foreign exchange fluctuations on our
Operating results.

Both in the fourth quarter and in the full year 2019, foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on
both revenue and EBITDA and a negative impact on costs.

4.2 Interest rate risk

Our target is to reduce volatility in net interest flows. In order to achieve this objective, Amadeus may enter
into interest rate hedging agreements (interest rate swaps, caps, collars) to cover the floating rate debt.

® Including Cost of revenue, Personnel expenses and Other operating expenses. Excludes Depreciation and amortization.

” Report for the year ended December 31, 2019 (millions of euros) a M a D E | ] S

At December 31, 2019, 33% of our total financial debt’ (related to the European Commercial Paper Program
and one Eurobond issue) was subject to floating interest rates, indexed to the EURIBOR. As of this date no
interest rate hedges were in place.

4.3. Ownshares price evolution risk
Amadeus has three different staff remuneration schemes which are settled with Amadeus’ shares.

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature all beneficiaries will receive a number of Amadeus
shares which for the outstanding plans amount to (depending on the evolution of certain performance
conditions), between a minimum of 300,000 shares and a maximum of 1,340,000 shares, approximately. It is
Amadeus’ intention to make use of its treasury shares to settle these plans at their maturity.

competitive position® expanded by 1.0 p.p. in the full-year period. Amadeus bookings reported high growth
in Latin America, Central, Eastern and Southern Europe and, most notably, in North America. Amadeus
bookings in Western Europe reported growth, on the back of robust market share gains and despite the
industry contraction (affected by macroeconomic effects, bankruptcies and strikes). Amadeus bookings in
Asia-Pacific and Middle East and Africa, impacted by the industry booking decline, showed a contraction.
Amadeus Asia-Pacific bookings were also impacted by Air India’s cancellation of our distribution agreement
at the end of 2018°, and by the cessation of operations of Jet Airways in April 2019.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, Amadeus travel agency air bookings declined by 1.5%, impacted by India.
Excluding India, Amadeus’ global air bookings grew by 1.3% in the quarter. Amadeus air bookings grew in all
regions, except for Western Europe, Asia-Pacific and Middle East and Africa. Despite market share gains in
the regions, Amadeus bookings in Western Europe and in Middle East and Africa declined, impacted by the
industry contraction.

In 2019, 4.2% distribution revenue growth resulted from (i) an increase in bookings of 0.5%, (ii) an expansive

In the fourth quarter of 2019, distribution revenue increased by 1.5% vs. the same period of 2018. Fourth-
quarter revenue growth decelerated vs. previous quarters, due to (i) a 0.8% reduction in booking volumes, as

exchange effects.

5.1.3 Contribution

In 2019, contribution increased by 1.8% to €1,405.4 million, representing 44.9% of revenue. Contribution
growth resulted from an increase in revenue of 4.2%, as explained in section 5.1.2 above, and a 6.3% increase
in net operating costs, which mainly resulted from (i) 0.4% higher booking volumes, (ii) a unitary distribution
cost expansion, mainly resulting from an increase in our average unitary incentive fee for travel agencies,
mostly due to competitive pressure, (iii) double-digit growth in commissions paid to travel agencies for the
use of our distribution payments solutions, driven by the strong business performance, and (iv) negative
foreign exchange effects.

IT transactional revenue’?

In this category we include revenues from (i) our IT offering for airlines, including passenger service systems,
digital solutions, merchandizing and personalization tools, and revenue optimization and disruption
management software, among others, and (iv) our Airport IT and Payments IT (the Merchant Hub offering)
businesses.

IT transactional revenue increased by 9.1% in 2019, driven by:

Airline IT transactional revenue growth, resulting from (i) PB volume expansion, as explained in section
5.2.1, and (ii) an expansive airline IT transactional revenue per PB, supported by upselling activity
(including solutions such as revenue management, disruption management, merchandizing and
personalization and revenue accounting), and despite the negative impact from an increasing weight of
low-cost and hybrid carriers.

The positive contribution from the airport IT and payments IT businesses.

Direct distribution revenue

Direct distribution revenue mainly includes fees charged for bookings made through the direct sales channel
of an airline using our Altéa Reservation solution and for certain types of bookings made through the direct
sales channel of Altéa customers, for which we charge a booking fee, not a PB fee. It also includes several
solutions related with the booking process.

Revenue from direct distribution increased by 10.0%, driven by booking volume growth and the positive
performance of several solutions, such as Amadeus Customs.

Airline services and hospitality IT revenue

This caption mainly comprises (i) the provision of bespoke and consulting services, (ii) the recognition of
deferred customization and implementation fees of our solutions, and (iii) our Hospitality IT solutions.

Airline services and hospitality IT revenue increased by 87.3% in 2019, highly impacted by the consolidation
of TravelClick. Excluding TravelClick, this revenue line grew at a double-digit rate, driven by an increase in
revenue from services provided to airlines, and double-digit growth delivered by hospitality IT. Both
hospitality IT excluding TravelClick, and TravelClick standalone grew at a double-digit growth rate.

5.2.3 Contribution

In 2019, contribution expanded by 16.7%, amounting to €1,577.9 million. This positive performance was the
combination of 26.2% revenue growth, as explained in section 5.2.2 above, and 48.0% increase in our net
operating costs. Growth in net operating costs was highly impacted by the consolidation of TravelClick.
Excluding TravelClick, underlying growth in net operating costs resulted from:

Higher personnel-related expenses, driven by the reinforcement of our commercial teams to better
support the expansion of our product offering and customer base, as well as, increased R&D expenditure
dedicated to our airline IT portfolio evolution and expansion and to our new businesses, coupled with
growth in unit personnel cost.

An increase in several cost lines, such as bad debt provisions, which by nature may show a more volatile
behavior per quarter.

A lower capitalization ratio, impacted by project mix.

Negative foreign exchange effects.

5.3. EBITDA

In the fourth quarter of 2019, EBITDA amounted to €481.5 million, a 6.4% increase vs. the fourth quarter of
2018. EBITDA growth resulted from a higher contribution from our Distribution and IT Solutions businesses,
an increase in net indirect costs and the TravelClick consolidation effect. EBITDA growth was positively
impacted by foreign exchange effects. EBITDA margin was 35.9% in the period, in line with the fourth quarter
of last year.

In 2019, EBITDA increased by 10.0% to €2,245.3 million. EBITDA growth resulted from the increase in the
Distribution and IT Solutions contributions, partly offset by an increase in net indirect costs. EBITDA growth
was positively impacted by foreign exchange effects (see section 4.1 for details on the exposure of our
operating results to foreign exchange fluctuations). In the full-year period, EBITDA margin declined by 1.0 p.p.
to 40.3%, impacted by (i) the TravelClick consolidation, (ii) a decrease in the Group capitalization ratio, and
(iii) a double-digit growth rate delivered by our distribution payments business, a lower margin business.
Excluding the impact from these effects, EBITDA margin was broadly stable.

Net indirect costs increased by 6.6% in 2019 vs. 2018, mainly driven by increased resources in our corporate
functions to support our business expansion, the addition of TravelClick’s indirect costs and negative foreign
exchange effects.

6.1.1 Revenue

In the fourth quarter of 2019, revenue amounted to €1,341.3 million, growing 6.4% vs. prior year. In 2019,
revenue increased by 12.8% to €5,577.9 million. Revenue growth resulted from:

A 4.2% increase in Distribution revenue in 2019, as detailed in section 5.1.2.
A 26.2% increase in IT Solutions in 2019, as detailed in section 5.2.2.

In 2019, revenue growth was impacted by the TravelClick consolidation and positive foreign exchange effects.

Revenue 1,341.3 1,260.1 6.4% 5,577.9 4,943.9 12.8%

6.1.2 Cost of revenue

These costs are mainly related to: (i) incentive fees paid to travel sellers for bookings done through our
reservations platforms, (ii) distribution fees paid to local commercial organizations which act as a local
distributor (mainly in the Middle East, North Africa, India, and South Korea), (iii) data communication
expenses related to the maintenance of our computer network, including connection charges, (iv) fees paid
in relation to advertising and data analytics activities in Hospitality, and (v) commissions paid to travel agencies
for the use of our payments distribution solutions.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, cost of revenue amounted to €346.9 million, 4.4% higher than in the same
period of 2018. In the full-year period, cost of revenue grew by 18.4%, highly impacted by the consolidation
of TravelClick. Cost of revenue was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects across the year.

Excluding TravelClick and foreign exchange effects, cost of revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate in 2019,
mainly as a result of (i) our distribution payments solutions high growth in the period, generating double-digit
growth in commissions paid to travel agencies, and (ii) a unitary distribution cost expansion, driven by an
increase in our average unitary incentive fee for travel agencies, mostly due to competitive pressure.

6.1.3. Personnel and related expenses and other operating expenses

A large number of Amadeus’ employees are software engineers. Amadeus also hires contractors to support
development activity, complementing permanent staff, which provides flexibility to increase or reduce our
development activity. The overall ratio of permanent staff vs. contractors devoted to R&D may fluctuate
depending on business needs and project mix, therefore impacting the evolution of both “Personnel
expenses” and “Other operating expenses” captions in our income statement.

Our combined operating expenses cost line, representing both Personnel expenses and Other operating
expenses, increased by 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019, vs. prior year. In 2019, this combined cost line
grew 12.2%, highly impacted by the consolidation of TravelClick. Growth in our fixed cost base resulted from:

A 11% increase in average FTEs (permanent staff and contractors), mainly due to (i) the addition of
TravelClick’s employees, (ii) higher resources devoted to R&D (see further details in sections 2.2 and
6.3.2), and (iii) the expansion of our commercial teams and customer support units to support the
ongoing customer implementations and commercial activities. Excluding TravelClick, Amadeus FTEs grew
by 4% in the full-year period.

Growth in unit personnel cost, as a result of our global salary increase.

A negative impact from foreign exchange effects.

6.1.4 Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization was 15.9% higher in 2019 vs. 2018. In particular, ordinary D&A grew by 14.6%,
driven by a higher amortization of intangible assets, as capitalized development expenses on our balance
sheet started being amortized in parallel with the associated project or contract revenue recognition. Also,
an increase in depreciation expense related to hardware and software acquired, and the consolidation of
TravelClick, contributed to the increase in ordinary D&A in the year.

In 2019, impairment losses amounted to €29.2 million, and were mostly related to (i) specific developments
and implementation efforts carried out for customers that have either cancelled contracts, suspended or
ceased operations, and (ii) investments related to new solutions or technology which did not or will not deliver
the expected benefits.

6.1.5 EBITDA and Operating income

In the fourth quarter of 2019, operating income grew by 6.1%, driving 7.5% growth in 2019. Operating income
growth resulted from EBITDA expansion, partly offset by higher D&A charges.

In 2019, EBITDA increased by 10.0% to €2,245.3 million. EBITDA growth resulted from the positive
contributions of Distribution and IT Solutions, as well as the TravelClick consolidation effect, partly offset by
an increase in net indirect costs. EBITDA growth was positively impacted by foreign exchange effects. In 2019,
EBITDA margin declined by 1.0 p.p. to 40.3%, impacted by (i) the TravelClick consolidation, (ii) a decrease in
the Group capitalization ratio, and (iii) a double-digit growth rate delivered by our distribution payments
business, a lower margin business. Excluding the impact from these effects, EBITDA margin was broadly
stable.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, EBITDA amounted to €481.5 million, a 6.4% increase vs. the fourth quarter of

2018. EBITDA growth was supported by positive foreign exchange effects. EBITDA margin was 40.3% in the
fourth quarter, in line with the fourth quarter of last year.

6.1.6 Net financial expense

Net financial expense increased by €4.8 million, or 8.9%, in 2019. Interest expense grew by €4.1 million or

10.8%, as a consequence of a higher amount of average gross debt outstanding, compared to 2018, driven
by TravelClick’s acquisition.

6.1.7 Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to €322.1 million in 2019, 7.1% lower than 2018. The income tax rate for 2019 was
21.9%, a decrease vs. 24.1% reported in the first nine months of 2019, and 25.2% reported in 2018. This
decrease was mostly driven by recent changes in tax regulation, mainly in France (the new French Patent Box
Regime), resulting in an increase in tax deductions expected for the year, associated with R&D. Income taxes
declined by 44.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019, impacted by the reduction in the income tax rate for the
year associated with the above mentioned effect.

6.1.8 Profit for the period. Adjusted profit
Reported profit amounted to €1,161.6 million in 2019, a 12.6% increase vs. the same period of 2018. After

adjusting for (i) accounting effects derived from PPA exercises and impairment losses, (ii) non-operating
exchange gains (losses), and (iii) other non-operating items, adjusted profit increased by 13.4% to €1,270.2

Net financial debt, as per our credit facility agreements’ terms, amounted to €2,758.4 million at December
31, 2019 (representing 1.23x times last-twelve-month EBITDA).

The main changes to our debt in 2019 were:

The amortization of €500 million bonds issued in May 2017, which reached maturity in May 2019.

The increase in the use of the Multi-Currency European Commercial Paper (ECP) program by a net
amount of €250.0 million.
The repayment of €65.0 million related to our European Investment Bank loan.

On April 27, 2018 Amadeus executed a new €1,000 million Single Currency Revolving Loan Facility, with a five-
year term, to be used for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. On the same date,
Amadeus cancelled both the Facility A of the Revolving Credit Facility, signed on March 5, 2015, and the
Revolving Credit Facility signed on April 26, 2016, each of them amounting to €500.0 million. The new
revolving facility remained undrawn at December 31, 2019.

Under our credit facility agreements’ terms, financial debt (i) does not include the accrued interest payable
(€5.7 million at December 31, 2019) which is treated as financial debt in our financial statements, (ii) is
calculated based on its nominal value, while in our financial statements our financial debt is measured at
amortized cost, i.e. after deducting the deferred financing fees (that mainly correspond to fees paid upfront
in connection with the set-up of new credit agreements and amount to €10.6 million at December 31, 2019),

(iii) does not include an adjustment for the difference between the nominal value of the loan granted by the
EIB at below-market interest rate and its fair value (€0.9 million at December 31, 2019), and (iv) does not
include debt related to assets under operating lease agreements (which form part of the financial debt in the
statement of financial position) amounting to €257.1 million at December 31, 2019.

In 2019, Amadeus Group free cash flow amounted to €1,030.4 million, 5.6% higher than in 2018, impacted
by an increase in taxes paid in the first quarter of 2019. Free cash flow was also impacted by non-recurring
costs related to TravelClick’s acquisition, amounting to €14.4 million, paid in 2019, and €12.9 million, paid in
2018. Excluding these non-recurring costs paid in relation to TravelClick’s acquisition, pre-tax free cash flow
increased by 8.1%.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, Amadeus Group free cash flow amounted to €221.1 million, an increase of
27.2% vs. the same period of 2018. Excluding non-recurring costs paid in relation to TravelClick’s acquisition,
both in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, free cash flow increased by 24.4%. See section 3.1 for further
explanation about TravelClick’s acquisition effects.

6.3.1 Change in working capital

In 2019, the change in working capital deteriorated by €96.0 million vs. previous year. The change in working
capital, both in 2019 and 2018, was impacted by TravelClick’s acquisition related effects (see section 3.1 for
further explanation about TravelClick’s acquisition effects). Excluding TravelClick’s acquisition related effects,
the change in working capital in 2019 deteriorated by €72.2 million, mainly resulting from: (i) payments,
amounting to €34.3 million, advanced from January 2020 to December 2019, due to scheduled changes in
accounting and payment systems during January 2020 in several countries, which interrupted the payment
flows for a period of time during the January month, (ii) an increase in advanced payments related to

customer renegotiations, and (iii) timing differences in some payments and collections, partly related to VAT
reimbursements.

6.3.2 Capital expenditure, R&D investment

Capital expenditure

The table below details the capital expenditure, both in relation to property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”)
and to intangible assets. Based on the nature of our investments in PP&E, the figures may show variations on
a quarterly basis, depending on the timing of certain investments. The same applies to our investments in
contractual relationships where payments to travel agencies may take place in different periods, based on
the timing of the negotiations. In turn, our capitalized R&D investment may fluctuate depending on the level
of capitalization ratio, which is impacted by the intensity of the development activity, the mix of projects
undertaken and the different stages of the various projects.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, capex declined by €19.9 million, or 9.4%, vs. the same period of 2018, mainly
driven by (i) a reduction in software capitalizations, resulting from a decrease in R&D investment in the period,
coupled with a decline in the capitalization ratio, and (ii) lower signing bonuses paid.

In 2019, capex amounted to €736.1 million, an increase of €17.9 million, or 2.5%, vs. previous year. As a
percentage of revenue, capex decreased by 1.3 p.p. to 13.2%. The growth in capex in 2019 was driven by:

A €32.9 million, or 5.4% increase in capex in intangible assets, as a result of higher capitalizations from
software development (driven by the increase in R&D investment, as explained below, coupled with a
lower capitalization ratio), the TravelClick consolidation effect and an increase in signing bonuses paid.

A€15.0 million, or 13.8% decline in capex in property, plant and equipment.

It is important to note that a large part of our R&D capitalizations do not have any revenue associated at this
stage (particularly in the case of new diversification initiatives), or are investments for projects that will
produce revenue during the life of the contracts, on average 10 to 15 years in Airline IT and 3 to 5 in
Distribution, thereby affecting the capex as a percentage of revenue ratio.

R&D investment

In the fourth quarter of 2019, R&D investment (including both capitalized and non-capitalized expense)
declined by 0.1%, compared to the same period of previous year, mainly due to a reduction in the efforts
devoted to some internal performance enhancement projects, coupled with an increase in research tax
credits.

In 2019, R&D investment increased by 10.1% vs. prior year. As a percentage of revenue, R&D investment
amounted to 17.3%, in line with previous year. Growth in R&D investment in the full-year period resulted
from:

Increased resources to enhance and expand our product portfolio (including efforts related to NDC,
shopping and digital solutions, etc.).

TravelClick) and payments.

Investment focused on cloud services and the continued enhancement of our overall infrastructure and
processes to enhance efficiency, flexibility, availability and security.

See section 2.2 for further detail on our R&D projects.

It should be noted that a significant part of our research and development costs are linked to activities which
are subject to capitalization. The intensity of the development activity and the different stages in the ongoing
projects have an effect on the capitalization ratio in any given quarter, thereby impacting the level of
operating expenses that are capitalized on our balance sheet.

€4.0 million of RTC. As a result, R&D investment amounted to €712.1 million in the first nine months of 2019.

6.3.3. Taxes paid

Cash taxes increased by €47.7 million, or 16.6%, in 2019 vs. previous year, mainly due to (i) no
reimbursements from taxes paid in previous years in 2019, compared to reimbursements received from
previous years in 2018 (mainly in the first quarter), and (ii) higher taxes paid in several countries from previous
years, driven by increases in profits before taxes. Cash tax savings in France as a result of an increase in tax
deductions expected for the year, associated with R&D (as a consequence of recent changes in tax
regulation), partly offset these effects.

6.3.4 Interest and financial fees paid

Interest payments under our debt arrangements amounted to €35.4 million in 2019, €2.9 million or 8.9%
higher than in 2018. This increase was mostly due to a higher amount of average gross debt, compared to
2018, driven by TravelClick’s acquisition.

6.3.5 Equity investments

Equity investments amounting to €46.2 million in 2019 and €1,315.1 in 2018 mainly related to ICM’s and
TravelClick’s acquisitions, respectively, as detailed in section 3.2.

6.3.6 Non-operating items

In 2019, cash outflow from non-operating items amounted to €51.6 million, and mostly responded to hedging
costs and results, mainly in relation to a USD-denominated intercompany loan, linked to TravelClick’s
acquisition. See section 3.1 for details on TravelClick’s acquisition.

6.3.7. Cash to shareholders

In 2019, the cash outflow to shareholders, amounting to €516.3 million, mainly corresponds to the
payment of the ordinary dividend of €1.175 per share (gross) on the 2018 profit, as detailed in section
7.3.

this, the proposed appropriation of the 2019 results included in our 2019 audited consolidated financial
statements includes a total amount of €560.6 million corresponding to dividends pertaining to the financial
year 2019.

8 Other additional information
8.1 Expected Business Evolution
8.1.1 Macroeconomic environment

Given that Amadeus operates transaction-based business models, our operating results are highly linked to
travel volumes (mainly bookings made by travel agencies connected to the Amadeus Distribution system, or
passengers boarded by airlines using our IT solutions) at a global scale. Amadeus’ businesses and operations
are largely dependent on the evolution of the worldwide travel and tourism industry, which is sensitive to
general economic conditions and trends.

This year, the Coronavirus outbreak in China will likely have an impact on global GDP and air traffic. It is too
early to understand the duration and severity.

In January 2020, prior to the Coronavirus outbreak, the IMF updated its World Economic Outlook. Following
the synchronized slowdown of economic growth seen in 2019, they estimate a slight recovery in 2020, with
forecasted global economic growth of 3.3% (vs. 2.9% in 2019). However, they also caution this projected
recovery is not worldwide and has risks

Growth in the advanced economies is projected to decline slightly (1.6% in 2020 vs. 1.7% in 2019), mainly
driven by a slowdown expected in the United States (2.0% in 2020, vs. 2.3% in 2019), somewhat offset by
an increase in the Euro Zone (1.3% in 2020 vs. 1.2% in 2019).

This means all the projected recovery is expected to come from the emerging markets and developing
economies, which are estimated to grow by 4.4% in 2020 (vs. 3.7% in 2019). This is driven by recoveries
or shallower recessions in stressed emerging markets, such as Turkey, Argentina, and Iran, and also by
recoveries in countries where growth slowed significantly in 2019 such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia,
and Saudi Arabia.

Despite the slight acceleration of world GDP expected in 2020, IATA forecast air traffic to grow at a similar
rate than in 2019. IATA have forecasted an expansion of by 4.1%?° in 2020 (vs. 4.2% in 2019). All regions are
expected to perform positively: Africa (4.9%), Asia-Pacific (4.8%), Middle-East (2.5%), Latin America (4.3%),
North America (3.8%) and Europe (3.8%).

8.1.2 | Amadeus strategic priorities and expected business evolution in 2020

Amadeus is a leading technology provider for the travel industry. Amadeus has built commercial relationships
with players across the industry, including airlines, travel agencies, hotels and airports, among others, and
across the globe (with presence in more than 190 countries). Amadeus has invested consistently over the
years to have a unique technology offering. Having market leading technology allows us to serve our
customers better, to customize more efficiently and to continue innovating.

In Distribution, we see growth coming from adding travel providers and travel agencies to our network, as
well as from expanding the content offering distributed through Amadeus. In Airline IT, future growth will be
driven by (i) implementing new customers to our current solutions, (ii) increasing the penetration of our
solutions within our current customer base, and (iii) expanding our portfolio of solutions to address customer
needs. Additionally, we expect growth to come from our new businesses, including Hospitality, Airport IT an
Payments, as we further progress in each of them.

In 2020, we expect to continue evolving positively. In Distribution, we expect to maintain our leadership
position, supported by our sustained investment in R&D and focus on innovation, global footprint, loca
market understanding and travel industry expertise.

In Airline IT, our PSS business will continue to expand as we implement our upcoming, contracted migrations,
while also benefiting from the full-year impact of the 2019 customer implementations such as Air Canada.
This is despite the full-year negative impact from several airline customers that ceased or suspende
operations during 2019. Beyond the PSS business, we continue to invest on enhancing and expanding our
solutions portfolio in order to sustain our upselling activity, with particular focus on the areas of
merchandising, personalization, revenue optimization, digitalization, and disruption management.

In Hospitality, 2019 saw a solid performance, with a double-digit growth giving us a good foundation to deliver
growth in the coming years. During 2020, we will continue to progress in seamlessly integrating our offering,
to reap the synergies and address the opportunity we have to cross-sell across our technology stack, creating
a hospitality leader that provides a broad range of innovative solutions to hotels and chains of all sizes across
the globe.

Investing in technology is a key pillar to our success. In 2020, Amadeus will continue to invest in R&D to
support long term growth through new customer implementations, product evolution, portfolio expansion
(including non-air IT diversification) and cross-area technological projects. We will continue investing for our
NDC vision, which is to develop an integrated solution that can be widely adopted by both travel agencies and
airlines to deliver sustainable results on a scale that matters. Also, we will progress on our shift to next-
generation technologies and cloud services, as well as the application of new technologies, such as artificial
intelligence and machine learning.

Amadeus has a proven track record of operating a solid and resilient business model that results in consistent
cash generation, allowing for sustained investment in R&D and innovation, as well as for shareholder
remuneration, while maintaining a flexible capital structure. Ordinary dividends paid have grown consistently
every year since our IPO, at an average annual rate of 18% and we have complemented this with share
repurchases.

In December 2019, the Amadeus Board of Directors proposed a 50% 2019 dividend pay-out target ratio.
Accordingly, our Board of Directors will submit a final gross dividend of €1.30 per share - representing an
increase of 10.6% over 2018 - for approval to our General Shareholders’ Meeting in June 2020.

8.2 Research and Development Activities

Research and development (R&D) is core to the company’s strategy and key to a sustainable competitive
advantage. In addition, R&D activities help increase efficiency and improve the Amadeus System functionality,
as well as to reduce maintenance and operating costs.

The Group is continuously investing in its systems, including the development of new products and
functionalities, as well as the evolution of the existing platform, based on the latest state-of-the-art
technology available. The group has 16 development centers, including 3 regional centers and the central
development sites in Nice and Bangalore.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, Amadeus expensed €396.7 million for R&D activities and
capitalized €591.6 million (before deducting any incentives), which compares to €323.4 million and €573.0
million, respectively, in 2018.

Our R&D investment enables us to offer some of the most advanced, integrated and powerful business tools
available in the market, in order to deliver a best-in-class service to airlines and travel agencies. Indeed,
Amadeus offers enhanced functionalities, such as advanced search and booking engines, both for travel
agencies and travel providers. In addition, our product offering addresses the Passenger Service Systems for
airlines, enabling processes such as central reservation, inventory management, departure control and e-
commerce, as well as providing direct distribution technologies. We are also expanding our airline IT Solutions
offering and we are seeking to grow our market share within the non-airline IT Solutions markets, including
the hotel, rail and airport IT markets.

8.4 — Financial Risks

The Group, as a result of the normal course of its business activities, has exposure to foreign exchange,
interest rate, treasury shares price evolution, credit and liquidity risk. The goal of the Group is to identify,
measure and minimize these risks using the most effective and efficient methods to eliminate, reduce, or

Page 38


--- Page 37 ---

T Group, S.A. and Subsidiaries

compensate such exposures. With the purpose of managing these risks, in some occasions, the Group enters
into hedging activities with derivatives and non-derivative instruments.

8.4.1 Foreign exchange rate risk

As a result of the multinational orientation of its business, the Group is subject to foreign exchange risks
derived from the fluctuations of various currencies. The main objective of the Group’s foreign exchange
hedging strategy is to reduce the volatility of the countervalue in euros of the consolidated cash flows
measured in different currencies. The instruments used to achieve this goal depend on the foreign currency
of the operating cash flow to be hedged:

The strategy to minimize US Dollar (USD) exchange rate exposures is based on the use of natural hedges
and derivative instruments. This strategy aims at reducing the exposure created by the USD denominated
operating cash inflows of the Group with the payment in USD of the principal amount outstanding of the
USD denominated debt. Neither as of December 31, 2019, nor as of December 31, 2018, there was USD
denominated debt.
Aside from the risk on USD, there are foreign exchange risks derived from expenses denominated in a
variety of foreign currencies mainly in Sterling Pounds (GBP), Indian Rupees (INR), Australian Dollars (AUD)
and Singapore Dollars (SGD). A natural hedge strategy is not available in these cases; therefore the Group
engages into derivative contracts with banks: basically currency forwards, currency options and
combinations of currency options to hedge a significant portion of the aforementioned short exposures
(net expenses).

Since the objective in relation to exchange rate risk is to reduce the volatility of the euro values of cash flows
denominated in foreign currency, the Group’s total exposure exchange rate changes is measured in terms of
the Cash-flow at Risk (CFaR). This risk measure provides an estimate of the potential EUR loss of the foreign
currency denominated cash flows from the moment the estimation is calculated to the moment the cash
flow is expected to take place. These estimates are made using a 95% confidence level.

The CFaR methodology is similar in many respects to the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology. However, whereas
VaR is generally centered in the changes in the value of a portfolio of exposures in a given future interval of
time, CFaR is focused on the changes in the value of the cash-flows of that portfolio from the calculation date
to the moment in which these cash-flows are expected to effectively take place. In the case of Amadeus CFaR
is amore adequate measure of the risk of the Group given that the goal of our risk management strategy with
relation to foreign exchange risk is reducing the volatility of the EUR value of the foreign currency
denominated cash-flows. An additional reason for focusing on cash-flows is that, eventually, the cash-flows
of a company result in its level of liquidity which in the case of a non-financial corporation it is generally a
scarce and valuable element.

The main limitations of the CFaR methodology are very similar to the ones of the VaR methodology:

Firstly, its results are based on several of hypotheses on the future volatilities of the exchange rates and
the future correlation among them which may correspond with the real evolution of the exchange rates
or not?®

Additionally, the foreign exchange exposure estimates used as inputs to the model may deviate with
respect to the exposures which will finally take place in the future’”.

(16) The volatilities implicit in the market prices of currency options and the historic correlations among the main currencies in which
Amadeus has exposures are used as inputs to the model.

(17) In order to calculate the foreign currency exposures of the Group we take into account the estimated cash flows in each currency ac-
cording to the last available forecast and the foreign currency hedges contracted as of the CFaR calculation date.

s’ Report for the year ended December 31, 2019 (millions of euros) a M a D E | ] S

Finally, it is important to mention that given a level of CFaR calculated with a 95% confidence level, the
losses which could take place in the remaining 5% of the cases may be significantly greater than the level
of risk as measured with the CFaR methodology for a 95% confidence level.

The CFaR of the foreign exchange exposures of the Group calculated with a 95% confidence level is set forth
in the table below:

December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018
2020 CFaR 2021 CFaR 2022 CFaR 2019 CFaR 2020 CFaR 2021 CFaR
(10.7) (38.2) (87.6) (10.3) (38.1) (90.0)

As of the end of 2019, CFaR levels calculated for the next three years are similar or even lower than at the
end of 2018. The main reason is that the higher risk arising from larger US Dollar exposures expected is
compensated by larger hedging positions and lower prevailing foreign exchange implicit volatilities used in
the calculation.

As it can be observed in the table above, the level of risk measured in CFaR terms tends to increase for the
periods which are further away. The reasons for this are: (1) the further away the future cash-flows are, more
adverse the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations can be potentially; (2) the level of hedging is smaller for
the later periods; and (3) in the later periods the size of the foreign exchange exposures tends to be greater.

8.4.2 _ Interest rate risk

The objective of the Group in terms of interest rate risk management is reducing the volatility of the net
interest flows payable by the Group. In line with this goal as of December 31, 2019 approximately 67% (77%,
2018) of the debt contracted by the Group was fixed rate debt. No interest rate hedges were hedging this
debt as of December 31, 2019, and 2018.

The sensitivity of fair value of Amadeus debt to a 0.1% (10 bps) parallel shift of the interest rate curve as of
December 31, 2019, and 2018, is set forth in the table below:

December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018

+10 bps -10 bps +10 bps -10 bps

EUR denominated debt 8.0 (8.1) 10.5 (10.5)
Total (8.0) (8.1) 10.5 (10.5)

In 2019 there has been a reduction in the sensitivity of the EUR denominated debt to the movements of the
interest rate curve with respect to the previous year. This decrease has been basically produced by the
reduction on the amount of debt outstanding, basically due to maturities, and to the shorter average life of
the outstanding debt.

According to the table above a 10 bps drop in the level of interest rates would cause a loss in the fair value of
the debt (an increase of the liability) amounting to €8.1 million at December 31, 2019 (€10.5 million, 2018).

8.4.3. Treasury shares price evolution risk

As of December 31, 2019, the Group has three different remuneration schemes outstanding which are settled
with Amadeus shares; the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) and the Share Match
Plan (SMP).

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature their beneficiaries will receive a number of
Company's shares which for the outstanding plans will be (depending on the evolution of certain performance

conditions) between a maximum of 1,340,000 shares and a minimum of 300,000 shares, approximately. It is
Amadeus intention to make use of treasury shares to settle these plans at their maturity.

On October 10, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the acquisition from the Stock
Market up to a maximum of 1,250,000 ordinary shares of the Company (treasury shares) to meet obligations
arising from share-based plans (see note 20) during 2020, 2021 and 2022

The authorization was granted under the framework of a share buy-back program to be implemented in 2020
for all Group companies, except for Amadeus S.A.S. and its wholly owned subsidiary Amadeus Software Labs
Ltd., subject to a capped maximum amount of €72.0 million and a maximum of 900,000 ordinary shares,
representing 0.21% of the share capital of the Company.

Within the context of the general authorization of October 10, 2019, the governing body of Amadeus S.A.S.
will approve its specific share buy-back program (total or partial) for Amadeus S.A.S. and its wholly owned
subsidiary Amadeus Software Labs Ltd. up to a maximum of 350,000 ordinary shares, representing 0.08% of
the share capital of the Company. This specific share buy-back programs will cover the obligations of these
two companies arising from share-based plans (see note 20) during 2020.

8.4.4 Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial asset will cause a loss for the Group by failing to
discharge an obligation.

The Group cash and cash equivalents are deposited in major banks on the basis of diversification and the
credit risk of the available investment alternatives.

e credit risk of the Group’s customer accounts receivable is mitigated by the fact that the majority are
ettled through the clearing houses operated by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and
irlines Clearing House, Inc. (“ACH”). These systems guarantee that the cash inflows from our customers will
e settled at a certain fixed date, and mitigate the credit risk partially by the fact that the members of the
learing house are required to make deposits that would be used in the event of default. Moreover, our
ustomer base is large and unrelated which results in a low concentration of our credit risk.

channel it to the companies with cash needs.

This allocation of the cash position among the companies of the Group is mainly made through:

Three different cash pooling agreements. One with most of the subsidiaries located in the Euro area;
another one in US Dollars for the US subsidiaries and another one in British Pounds for the UK subsidiaries.
Through bilateral Treasury Optimization agreements between Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and its
subsidiaries.

Corporate Treasury monitors the Group’s cash position through rolling forecasts of expected cash flows.
These forecasts are performed by the subsidiaries of the Group and later on consolidated in order to examine
both the liquidity situation and prospects of the Group and its subsidiaries.

The detail of the contractual maturities of the Group’s debt financing as of the end of the financial year 2019
and 2018 is described in the note 17 “Current and non-current debt”.

In addition to other smaller treasury lines agreed with several banks, the Group has access to a Revolving
Credit facility as detailed in note 17. The facility has a notional of €1,000.0 million and can be used to cover
working capital needs and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019, this facility was fully unused

and thus €1,000.0 million can be used to cover the liquidity needs of the Group (as of December 31, 2018,
there wasn’t any used amount either).

Finally, Amadeus has a Multi-Currency European Commercial Paper (ECP) program amounting to €750.0
million. This program can be used for raising short term financing. As of December 31, 2019, €580.0 million
of this program were in use (€330.0 million, 2018).

8.5 Subsequent events

Amadeus completed the acquisition of Optym’s Sky business on January 31, 2020 through its subsidiary
Amadeus North America Inc. The transaction has been structured as an asset deal where Amadeus has
acquired from Innovative Scheduling, LLC, all of the property and assets of the business and assumed certain
liabilities of the business.

“The Sky Suite Products” acquired relate to network planning and flight scheduling solutions. At the core of
an airline’s operations is its ability to develop flight schedules with maximum profitability and reliability. For
the past three years, Amadeus and Optym have enjoyed a successful partnership, focusing on these core
operations with key customers in North America, Latin America and Europe.

The initial purchase price amounts to 40 million US Dollar. The transaction price includes different earn-out
scenarios based on annual qualified net revenues for the years 2022 and 2023 and on qualified new sales
between closing and December 31, 2023. The amount of contingent consideration recognized as of the
acquisition date amounts to 15 million US Dollar.

The main assets acquired consist of the software and contractual relationships linked to the Sky Suite Products
acquired. Cash, bank accounts, tax assets and all accounts receivable have been excluded, as well as any
liabilities to the extent related to the excluded assets. The Group is on the process of engaging a valuation
company to help us on the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and that is why as of the
date of issuance of these consolidated annual accounts the Group has not completed the initial accounting
for the carved-out business acquired.

Acquisition related costs amounting to €0.6 million have been recorded as expenses under “Other operating
expenses” in 2019.
