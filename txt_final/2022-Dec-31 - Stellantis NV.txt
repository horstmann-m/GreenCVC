MANAGEMENT REPORT
FCA-PSA Merger

On December 17, 2019, FCA and PSA entered into a combination agreement providing for the combination of FCA
and PSA through a cross-border merger, with FCA as the surviving legal entity in the merger (“Stellantis N.V.”).

On September 14, 2020, FCA and PSA agreed to amend the combination agreement. According to the combination
agreement amendment, the FCA Extraordinary Dividend, to be paid to former FCA shareholders was reduced to €2.9 billion,
with PSA’s 46 percent stake in Faurecia S.E. (“Faurecia’”’) planned to be distributed to all Stellantis shareholders promptly
after closing following approval of the Stellantis board and shareholders.

On January 4, 2021, PSA and FCA held their respective extraordinary general shareholder meetings in order to,
among other matters, approve the merger transaction. The respective shareholder meetings approved the merger. Following
the respective shareholder approvals and receipt of the final regulatory clearances, FCA and PSA completed the legal merger.

The conditions agreed to as part of the regulatory clearance did not have a material impact on the cash flows or
financial positions for the Company.

On January 17, 2021, the board of directors was appointed, the Stellantis articles of association became effective and
the combined company was renamed Stellantis. On this date, the Stellantis management and board of directors collectively
obtained the power and the ability to control the assets, liabilities and operations of both FCA and PSA. As such, under IFRS
3 - Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”), January 17, 2021 is the acquisition date for the business combination.

On January 29, 2021, the approximately €2.9 billion extraordinary distribution was paid to holders of FCA common
shares of record as of the close of business on Friday, January 15, 2021. Refer to Note 3, Scope of consolidation, within the
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

Identification of the accounting acquirer

The merger was accounted for by Stellantis using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3,
which requires the identification of the acquirer and the acquiree for accounting purposes. Based on the assessment of the
indicators under IFRS 3 and consideration of all pertinent facts and circumstances, management determined that PSA is the
acquirer for accounting purposes and as such, the merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition. In identifying PSA
as the acquiring entity, notwithstanding that the merger was effected through an issuance of FCA shares, the most significant
indicators were (i) the composition of the combined group’s board, composed of eleven directors, six of whom were to be
nominated by PSA, PSA shareholders or PSA employees, or were current PSA executives, (ii) the combined group’s first
CEO, who is vested with the full authority to individually represent the combined group, and was the president of the PSA
Managing Board prior to the merger, and (iii) the payment of a premium by pre-merger shareholders of PSA. Refer to Note 3,
Scope of consolidation, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional
information.

Faurecia Distribution

On January 25, 2021, an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders was convened in order to approve the
distribution by Stellantis to the holders of its common shares of up to 54,297,006 ordinary shares of Faurecia (an automotive
equipment supplier) and up to €308 million, which are the proceeds received by Peugeot S.A. in November 2020 from the
sale of certain ordinary shares of Faurecia. The distribution represented the legacy PSA ownership in Faurecia and
approximately 39 percent of the share capital of Faurecia and became unconditional on March 10, 2021, with (i) ex-date on
Monday, March 15, 2021; and (ii) record date on Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Holders of Stellantis common shares have been
entitled to: (i) 0.017029 ordinary shares of Faurecia; and (ii) €0.096677 for each common share of Stellantis they hold on the
record date for the Distribution. The distribution occurred on March 22, 2021, resulting in 53,130,574 ordinary shares of
Faurecia and €302 million in cash distributed. The Company lost control of Faurecia on January 11, 2021. Refer to Note 3,
Scope of consolidation, and to Note 27, Equity, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report for additional information on Faurecia deconsolidation and distribution.

Stellantis as of December 31, 2021. Please refer to the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2021
included elsewhere within this report for additional information.

Refer to the section FCA-PSA Merger included above for information on the reverse acquisition presentation of the
financial statements and to Note 3, Scope of consolidation in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere
within this report for additional information on the merger.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information presented herein is derived from (i) the Consolidated
Income Statement of Stellantis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included elsewhere in this report, (ii) FCA’s
Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2020, contained in FCA’s Annual Report on Form 20-F
filed with the SEC on March 4, 2020, (iii) the consolidated statement of income included in the audited consolidated financial

The consolidated financial statements of Stellantis, PSA and FCA are prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by
the IASB and in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. There is no effect on the consolidated financial
statements resulting from differences between IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The

policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Stellantis as of and for year ended December 31,
2021 and 2020 included elsewhere in this report.

The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Financial Information to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are directly attributable to the merger
and factually supportable. Specifically, the pro forma adjustments relate to the following:

* The purchase price allocation, primarily to reflect adjustments to depreciation and amortization associated with
the acquired property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with a finite useful life, as well as a reduction
in the interest expense related to the fair value adjustment to financial liabilities.

+ The alignment of accounting policies of FCA to those applied by Stellantis.

* The elimination of intercompany transactions between FCA and PSA.

The pro forma adjustments relate to the two periods from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 and from January
1, 2021 to January 16, 2021.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Note 1 — Stellantis / PSA Historical Consolidated (as adjusted)

This column represents the Consolidated Income Statement of Stellantis for the year ended December 31, 2021 and
the PSA Historical Consolidated Income Statement (as adjusted) for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is derived
from the historical consolidated statement of income of PSA for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In accordance with IFRS 3, PSA was determined to be the acquirer for accounting purposes, therefore, the year
ended December 31, 2020 represents the continuing operations of PSA adjusted for the discontinuation of Faurecia. Refer to
Note 3, Scope of consolidation, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere within this report for
additional information.

Note 2 — FCA Historical

This column represents FCA’s results for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 16, 2021, as derived from
FCA’s accounting records as well as the FCA consolidated income statement included in FCA’s audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. In order to conform to the presentation of Stellantis in its
Consolidated Income Statement for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included elsewhere within this report,
Results from investments related to equity method investments are reclassified to Share of the profit of equity method
investees, and Results from Investments other than equity method investments are reclassified to Net financial expenses.

Note 3 — Purchase Price Allocation

As noted in the introduction to this Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, the merger has been
accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3, with PSA identified as the accounting
acquirer (reverse acquisition accounting). The acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3 applies the fair value concepts
defined in IFRS 13 and requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business
combination be recognized by the acquirer at their fair values as of the merger date, which for accounting purposes was
January 17, 2021. As a result, the acquisition method of accounting has been applied and the assets and liabilities of FCA
have been recognized at the merger acquisition date at their respective fair values, with limited exceptions as permitted by
IFRS 3. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of FCA’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed has
been recorded as goodwill. Refer to Note 3, Scope of consolidation, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere within this report for additional information.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information reflects the effects of the purchase accounting
adjustments, where applicable, on the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2020 as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2020.

The following tables provide a summary of the pro forma effects of the purchase price allocation adjustments in the
unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The pro forma adjustments are described in further detail below.

A. Intangible assets

The fair value of brands (Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Fiat, Maserati, Alfa Romeo and Mopar) was determined through an
income approach based on the relief from royalty method, which requires an estimate of future expected cash flows. The
useful life associated with the brands is determined to be indefinite. For capitalized development expenditures, the fair value
has been assessed according to a multi-criteria approach based on relief from royalty method and an excess-earning method.
The fair value for the Dealer network has been assessed using the replacement cost method. The fair value of reacquired
rights has been valued based on the discounted cash flows expected from the related agreement.

Amortization of intangible assets has been calculated on the fair value taking into account the estimated remaining
useful life of the acquired assets. The related change in amortization as a result of the fair value adjustment to intangible
assets was a net decrease in amortization expense of €40 million and €964 million for the period January | to January 16,
2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, of which €40 million and €960 million has been recorded
within Research and development costs in relation to capitalized research and development costs and other intangible assets,
respectively, and €8 million has been recorded within Selling, general and other costs in relation to the dealer network and (4)
million has been recorded within Cost of revenues in relation to reacquired rights for the year ended December 31, 2020.


--- Page 7 ---

B. Property, plant and equipment

The fair value of property, plant and equipment was determined primarily through the replacement cost method,
which requires an estimation of the physical, functional and economic obsolescence of the related assets. A market approach,
which requires the comparison of the subject assets to transactions involving comparable assets, was applied to determine the
fair value of land. The fair value of certain assets was determined through an income approach.

Depreciation has been calculated on the fair value taking into account the estimated remaining useful life of the
acquired assets. The related change in depreciation as a result of the fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment
was a decrease in depreciation expense of €47 million and €1,136 million for the period January | to January 16, 2021 and
for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, of which €45 million and €1,092 million has been recorded within Cost
of revenues and €2 million and €44 million has been recorded within Selling, general and other costs in the Unaudited Pro
Forma Consolidated Financial Information.

C. Financial liabilities

Purchase price adjustments were recognized to step up to fair value the financial liabilities based on quoted market
prices for listed debt and based on discounted cash flow models for debt that is not listed. The fair value adjustments to
financial liabilities resulted in a decrease in interest expense due to the decrease of the effective interest rate based on current
market conditions, of €21 million and €462 million for the period January | to January 16, 2021 and for the year ended
December 31, 2020, respectively, and has been recorded within Net financial income (expense) in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Financial Information.

D. Other
Primarily reflects:

* — the recognition of additional revenue of €2 million and €54 million for the period January 1 to January 16, 2021
and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, as a result of a step up to fair value of deferred revenue
relating to extended warranty service contracts, as well as additional finance costs of €4 million and €93 million
for the period January | to January 16, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, due to the
recognition of the fair value adjustments of the related liabilities.

«the reversal of the impact on cost of revenues of €7 million and €232 million for the period January | to January
16, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, of certain prepaid assets that were written off

as part of the purchase price allocation.

The step up in the value of inventories has not been recognized as a pro forma adjustment as this impact has been
recognized in Stellantis results for the year ended December 31, 2021.

E. Tax expense

Represents the tax effects on the pro forma adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated income
statement, calculated based on statutory tax rates applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.


--- Page 8 ---

Note 4 — Other Adjustments
Other adjustments mainly include the following:

* the elimination of the intercompany transactions with Sevel in the Stellantis Consolidated Income Statement for
the year ended December 31, 2020 of €534 million. Sevel is a joint operation that was previously owned 50
percent each by both PSA and FCA. Upon completion of the merger, Stellantis holds 100 percent of Sevel,
which is fully consolidated from that date;

* the alignment of FCA’s accounting policies to Stellantis accounting policies resulting in a net decrease in Net
profit of €100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily relating to an increase in Research and
development expenditures expensed;

* the alignment of the classification of certain items to align to Stellantis’ income statement presentation.

Stellantis N.V. (“Stellantis”) was incorporated as a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) under
the laws of the Netherlands on April 1, 2014 under the name Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V (“FCA”).

In its current configuration, Stellantis is the result of the merger of FCA and PSA, each of which were leading
independent global automotive groups prior to the merger.

Fiat S.p.A., the predecessor to FCA, was founded as Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino on July 11, 1899 in Turin,
Italy as an automobile manufacturer. Fiat grew in Italy and internationally in the following decades both organically and
through the acquisition of several prominent brands and manufacturers including Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Ferrari.
In 2009, FCA US LLC, then known as Chrysler Group LLC (“FCA US”), acquired the principal operating assets of the
former Chrysler LLC as part of a government-sponsored restructuring of the North American automotive industry. Between
2009 and 2014, Fiat S.p.A. expanded its initial 20 percent ownership interest to 100 percent of the ownership of FCA US and
on October 12, 2014, Fiat S.p.A. completed a corporate reorganization resulting in the establishment of FCA as the parent
company of the FCA Group, with its principal executive offices in the United Kingdom. In January 2011, the separation of
Fiat S.p.A.’s non-automotive capital goods business was completed with the creation of Fiat Industrial, now known as CNH
Industrial N.V. In October 2015, the initial public offering of Ferrari N.V. was completed, followed by the spin-off of FCA’s
remaining interest in Ferrari to its shareholders in January 2016.

Peugeot S.A. began manufacturing and selling vehicles to consumers in 1896 and also expanded its automotive
business, particularly in the second half of the twentieth century. In 1974, PSA acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Citroén S.A. and then merged the two companies in 1976. In 1978, PSA acquired Chrysler Corporation’s stake in its
industrial and commercial subsidiaries in Europe, as well as Chrysler Financial Corporation’s European commercial
financing subsidiaries. In 1995, PSA Finance Holding, which provided financing for Peugeot and Citroén vehicle sales, was
transformed into a bank and subsequently renamed “Banque PSA Finance”. PSA acquired the Opel and Vauxhall subsidiaries
of GM on August 1, 2017. As contemplated by the business combination agreement for the merger of FCA and PSA, on
March 22, 2021, Stellantis distributed to shareholders its entire interest (approximately 39 percent) in Faurecia, an automotive
equipment supplier and formerly the automotive equipment division of PSA, to holders of Stellantis common shares.

On December 17, 2019, FCA and PSA entered into a combination agreement (as amended, the “combination
agreement”) agreeing to merge the two groups. On January 16, 2021, PSA merged with and into FCA, with FCA as the
surviving legal entity in the merger. On January 17, 2021, the combined company was renamed Stellantis, the board of
directors was appointed and the Stellantis articles of association became effective. On this date, the Stellantis management
and board of directors collectively obtained the power and the ability to control the assets, liabilities and operations of both
FCA and PSA. As such, under IFRS 3 - Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”), January 17, 2021 is the acquisition date for the
business combination.

On January 18, 2021, Stellantis common shares began trading on Euronext Milan and Euronext Paris, and on
January 19, 2021, began trading on the NYSE. Stellantis common shares trade under the following symbols: Euronext Milan:
“STLAM”; Euronext Paris: “STLAP”; NYSE: “STLA”. From October 13, 2014, the common shares of FCA were traded on
the NYSE under the symbol “FCAU” and on Euronext Milan under the symbol “FCA”.

The principal office of Stellantis is located at Taurusavenue 1, 2132LS, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands (telephone
number: +31 23 700 1511). Its agent for U.S. federal securities law purposes is Christopher J. Pardi, c/o FCA US LLC, 1000
Chrysler Drive, Auburn Hills, Michigan 48326.

Expected Merger Synergies

As a result of the merger, we expect that we will achieve significant synergies from the integration of the legacy
businesses, in particular in the following four areas:

* Technology, Platforms and Products. The sharing and convergence of platforms, modules and systems, along
with the optimization of R&D investments, manufacturing processes and tooling, are expected to create
significant efficiencies;

+ Purchasing. Procurement savings are expected to result from leveraging the Company’s enlarged scale and
combined product development processes, leading to lower product costs, improved price alignment and
broader access to suppliers;

+ Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”). Savings are expected from the integration of
functions such as sales and marketing, and the optimization of costs in regions where both businesses had a
well-established presence (i.e., Enlarged Europe and South America); and

+ All Other Functions. Synergies are expected from the optimization of other functions, including logistics, where
savings are expected from the optimization of logistics for new cars and the effect of the procurement volume
increase on the Company’s combined expenditures, as well as supply chain, quality and after-market operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has achieved €7.1 billion of net cash synergies compared to
€3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 exceeding the €5 billion annual steady state target more than two years
earlier than planned at the time of the merger.

energy efficiency, reliability, consumer perception and sustainability of its products and services and to address the
challenges faced by the automotive industry, including environmental and safety regulations, emerging mobility trends,
connectivity, software and autonomous driving.

With respect to product development, Stellantis’ recent research initiatives have been mainly concentrated in the
areas of mobility electrification and clean energy, autonomous driving, and connectivity technologies. In 2022, Stellantis
announced its Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan and confirmed its target for 100 percent of its passenger car sales mix in
Europe and 50 percent of its passenger car and light duty truck sales mix in North America will be BEVs in 2030. As a result,
its research and development activities have shifted to focus on electrification and related technologies, as well as
autonomous technology and vehicle connectivity. Significant activity has also continued with a focus to reduce overall
vehicle energy demand, fuel consumption and emissions based on traditional technologies. Recent fuel consumption and
emissions reduction activities have primarily focused on propulsion system technologies, including engines, transmissions,
axles and drivelines, hybrid and electric propulsion and alternative fuels.

Strategic Initiatives
Modular Vehicle Platforms

In 2022, Stellantis continued development of its BEV platform strategy comprised of four platforms intended to
meet BEV customer and market needs in the different vehicle segments. The four platforms are:

+ STLA Small, with an estimated BEV range of up to 500 kilometers/300 miles, designed for ultra-compact cars;

+ STLA Medium, with an estimated BEV range of up to 700 kilometers/440 miles, designed for compact to mid-
size cars;


--- Page 19 ---

+ STLA Large, with an estimated BEV range of up to 800 kilometers/500 miles, designed for mid-size to full-size
vehicles; and

+ STLA Frame, with an estimated BEV range of up to 800 kilometers/500 miles, designed for full-size SUV and
pickup trucks.

Each platform is designed to have a high level of flexibility (length and width). The platforms will also share
electrified components and be capable of adapting over time to evolutions in technology.

Full-Electric Propulsion Systems

Stellantis is developing new electric propulsion systems centered on flexibility, modularity and efficiency to be
utilized on all four of the vehicle platforms. The strategy includes three families of electric drive modules (“EDM”) that
combine the motor, gearbox and inverter, each designed to meet different performance needs.

The EDMs can be configured for front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive. A program of hardware
upgrades and over-the-air (“OTA”) software updates is expected to extend the life cycle of the propulsion systems and,
therefore, the vehicles. Stellantis intends to internally develop software and controls in order to maintain characteristics
unique to each brand.

Battery Cell Chemistry and Design

Development and research on battery technology is ongoing and it is planned that, by 2024, Stellantis vehicles will
be supported by two main battery chemistries:

+ Nickel-based (“NMC”) module configuration with an energy density of 300-700Wh/L; and
+ Nickel cobalt-free alternative cell to pack configuration with an energy density of 400-500 Wh/L.

By design, the two chemistries are intended to be upgradeable, with the ability for potential future developments,
such as cost reduction, range extensions and charging speed increases.

In 2022, Stellantis made a minority equity investment in Factorial Inc., a U.S.-based battery development company
focused on the development, commercial production and deployment of solid-state battery technology that could offer up to
50 percent greater driving range than current lithium-ion technology.

Autonomous Driving Technology

In December 2022, Stellantis acquired aiMotive, a developer of advanced artificial intelligence and autonomous
driving software. The aiMotive technology product portfolio is focused on four key areas within artificial intelligence and
autonomous driving: embedded software stack for autonomous driving; artificial intelligence operations and data tooling;
expertise and intellectual property for silicon microchips; and software simulation for development of autonomous driving.

In July 2020, a second phase of the collaboration with Waymo (formerly the Google self-driving car project) was
announced. The first phase integrated Waymo’s self-driving technology into the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid as a development
platform for the autonomous fleets that Waymo is operating in several cities around the U.S. The second phase is expected to
focus on LCVs and to explore the potential of Level 4 automation for goods distribution.

A collaboration with Aptiv on the development of a Level 2+ (hands-off the wheel, eyes-on road) autonomous
driving system began in 2018. Testing on a fleet of vehicles with this capability has been completed and a launch is planned
for 2023.

A team of Stellantis and BMW engineers are working to develop an SAE Level 3 (hands-off the wheel, eyes-off the
road) capable autonomous driving platform which is intended to have the ability to be updated through OTA upgrades.
Prototype vehicles running early versions of the SAE Level 3 system have been running on public roads in Italy and the U.S.,
since 2020. A new generation of prototype vehicles having STLA AutoDrive, an updated SAE Level 3 system, will start
testing in 2023.

Connectivity and Software

Stellantis’ development of the “STLA Brain” is underway, which will reduce the number of electronic control units
per vehicle and enable technology enhancements and improvements. STLA Brain is a new electronic and software
architecture targeted to launch across its four battery electric vehicle platforms. This service-oriented architecture is intended
to be fully integrated with the cloud and connects electronic control units within the vehicle to the vehicle’s high-performance
computers. The STLA Brain enables software developers to create and update features more quickly without having to update
hardware. In addition, STLA Brain is intended to be OTA capable, which will reduce costs and simplify maintenance.

In 2021, Stellantis entered into the “Mobile Drive” joint venture with Hon Hai Technology Group (“Foxconn”) and
began developing the “STLA SmartCockpit” solutions. The STLA SmartCockpit is intended to be layered on top of the
STLA Brain to deliver Al-based applications such as navigation, voice assistance, e-commerce, and payment services.
Stellantis entered into a partnership with Amazon in early 2022 to integrate software technology into the STLA
SmartCockpit. The launch of STLA SmartCockpit technology is planned for end of 2024.

Hydrogen

Stellantis’ Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Center of Competence in Russelsheim, Germany is developing fuel cell electric
vehicle technology. In the fuel cells, hydrogen is combined with air to produce electricity to drive an electric motor where the
only exhaust emission is pure water vapor. As a result, the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles offer a combination of zero
emissions, fast refueling and long driving range. In May 2021, Stellantis introduced its first hydrogen fuel cell-powered LCV,
the Opel Vivaro-e HYDROGEN. In addition, Stellantis has entered into partnerships with two suppliers, Faurecia and
Symbio, for development of the hydrogen storage system and the fuel cell system, respectively.

BEV Propulsion System Technologies

Jeep introduced its first-ever BEV, the all-new Jeep Avenger, at the 2022 Paris Motor Show. The Ram 1500
Revolution BEV Concept and Peugeot Inception Concept were unveiled at the CES 2023 in Las Vegas (Nevada) in January
2023. The Peugeot Inception Concept is based on the STLA Large platform and is powered by a 100kWh battery and two
electronic motors, which provides a range of approximately 497 miles and almost 680hp. The Ram Revolution Concept
incorporates an efficient battery pack configuration and is powered by two EDMs, enabling the cabin to be moved forward,
increasing the cabin space and configuration flexibility. Using 800-volt DC fast charging at up to 350kW, the Revolution
Concept is able to add up to 100 miles of range in approximately 10 minutes.

Beginning in 2020, Stellantis launched seven full battery electric LCV’s in Europe, including the Peugeot e-Partner,
e-Boxer and e-Expert. As of December 31, 2021, the full LCV portfolio under the Peugeot and Opel brands were offered in
BEV versions.

In early 2020, as an alternative to public transport (bus, tramway, metro) and individual, two-wheeler means of
transport such as bikes and scooters, Citroén launched the fully electric AMI, an ultra-compact two-seat vehicle, which has a
battery that can recharge in three hours from a standard European electrical socket. A BEV variant of the Fiat 500, the Fiat
New 500, launched in October 2020 and is manufactured for the European market at the Mirafiori plant in Turin, Italy. The
Fiat New 500 is offered in electric ranges of 320 km and 180 km. The Fiat Ducato Electric was also unveiled in 2019 and
launched in Europe in 2021.

Beginning in 2019, the full battery electric DS 3 Crossback E-Tense, Peugeot e-208 and e-2008, Opel Corsa-e and
Mokka-e and Citroén E-C4 were sold in Europe. These models offer ranges of between 320 and 350 km based on Worldwide
Harmonized Light Vehicle Testing Procedures (“WLTP”).

Hybrid Propulsion Technologies

In 2022, Stellantis broadened its hybrid Jeep offering with the launch of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe in the North
American market. Offering up to 48 km of all-electric range and up to 51 km of all-electric city range, the 2023 Grand

Europe and China markets. In 2021, the DS9 E-Tense, Peugeot 508 PSE, Peugeot 308 Hybrid, DS4 E-Tense, Opel Vauxhall
Astra Hybrid and Citroén C5 X Hybrid were also launched.

In 2020, the Jeep Renegade and Compass 4xe launched in the European market with a range of up to 50 km on full
electric propulsion at zero emission. The electric units are integrated with the 1.3L turbo gasoline engine to increase
efficiency and overall power with the simultaneous action of the internal combustion engine and the electric motor delivering
up to 240 hp. Also in 2020, Maserati took its first step on its electrification path with the new Maserati Ghibli mild hybrid
equipped with a 2.0L turbo with e-booster and 48-volt BSG.

Beginning in 2019, the DS7 Crossback E-Tense, Peugeot 3008 Hybrid, Peugeot 508 Hybrid and 508 SW Hybrid,
Opel Vauxhall Grandland X Hybrid and Citroén C5 Aircross SUV Hybrid were also launched. These vehicles are available
with two- and four-wheel drive, and have total power of 300hp in the four-wheel drive version and 225hp in the two-wheel
drive version. These vehicles offer ranges of up to 59km (4x4) and 56km (4x2) in full electric mode (WLTP).

Battery Technology

In 2022, Stellantis finalized a joint venture with Samsung SDI for the production of battery cells and modules for
North America, targeted to begin production in Kokomo, Indiana (U.S.) in 2025 with initial annual production capacity of 23
GWh. In 2022, Stellantis and LG Energy Solution also announced a plan to invest $5 billion CAD in a joint venture for
Canada’s first large scale lithium-ion battery production plant, which will be built in Windsor, Canada. The agreement
between Stellantis and LG Energy Solution is subject to customary closing conditions.

In 2022, Stellantis also announced the expansion of its Automotive Research and Development Centre in Canada to,
among other things, establish a battery lab intended to be a center for the development and validation of BEV and PHEV
vehicle cells, modules and battery packs.

In 2020, Automotive Cell Company (“ACC”), a joint venture was formed with Total/Saft, for the development and
manufacture of high-performance batteries for the automotive industry. A research and development center in Bordeaux and
a pilot site in Nersac (France) were established by Automotive Cell Company to develop high-performance lithium-ion
technologies for electric car batteries. Production by the joint venture is planned to be launched in Douvrin (France) in 2023.
In May 2022, Mercedes-Benz AG joined ACC as its third partner.

ACC has also committed to gigafactories located in Kaiserslautern (Germany) and Termoli (Italy), in addition to the
ACC facility in Dourvin (France). These three facilities are expected to combine for aggregate battery production capacity of
120 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2030.

Vehicle Energy Demand

Stellantis research and development efforts regarding vehicle energy demand have been focused on reducing energy
loss, enhancing integration and improving overall vehicle efficiency.

Reductions in energy losses have been concentrated on weight reduction with the adoption of lightweight materials
for closures and structural components; aerodynamic drag improvements through static shape, aero shields, adjustable height
suspension and active front air dams; and lower rolling resistance tires. Additional development has also included reductions
in driveline energy loss, and the optimization of several electrical loads through the implementation of technologies.

Stellantis continues to undertake development activities on systems integration to find technical solutions for vehicle
energy demand. Internal combustion engines with 12v batteries are designed to be recharged by high efficiency alternators.
The climate control systems on PHEV and BEVs are designed to integrate both the cabin and battery cooling systems with
the adoption of fully electric air conditioning and advanced thermal management systems to control cabin temperatures.

Intellectual Property

Stellantis owns a significant number of patents, trade secrets, licenses, trademarks and service marks, including, in
particular, the marks of its vehicle and component and production systems brands, which relate to its products and services.
We expect the number to grow as we continue to pursue technological innovations. We file patent applications in Europe, the
U.S. and around the world to protect technology and improvements considered important to our business. No single patent is
material to our business as a whole.

Property, Plant and Equipment

As of December 31, 2022, Stellantis manufacturing facilities (including passenger vehicle and light commercial
vehicle assembly, propulsion systems and components plants, and excluding joint ventures), are primarily located in Enlarged
Europe (mainly in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico) and South America
(Brazil and Argentina). Stellantis companies have also historically owned other significant properties including parts
distribution centers, research laboratories, test tracks, warehouses and office buildings. The total carrying value of Stellantis’
property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2022 was €36.2 billion.

A number of Stellantis manufacturing facilities and equipment, including land and industrial buildings, plant and
machinery and other assets, were and are subject to mortgages and other security interests granted to secure indebtedness to
certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, property, plant and equipment reported as pledged as collateral for
loans amounted to approximately €1.4 billion, excluding Right-of-use assets (refer to Note 11, Property, plant and
equipment).

Stellantis was not aware of any environmental issues that would materially affect the utilization of fixed assets. See
Industrial Environmental Control.

Supply of Raw Materials, Parts and Components

Stellantis purchases a variety of components (including but not exclusively, mechanical, steel, electrical, electronic
and plastic components as well as castings and tires), raw materials, supplies, utilities, logistics and other services from
numerous suppliers. The purchase of raw materials, parts and components has historically accounted for 70-80 percent of
total Cost of revenues. Of these purchases, approximately 15-20 percent relates to the cost of raw materials, including but not
exclusively steel, rubber, aluminum, resin, copper, lead, precious metals (including platinum, palladium and rhodium) and
battery materials (including lithium, manganese, nickel and cobalt).

Stellantis’ focus on quality improvement, cost reduction, product innovation and production flexibility requires the
Company to rely upon suppliers with a focus on quality and the ability to provide cost reductions. Stellantis has valued
relationships with suppliers, and works to establish closer ties with a significantly reduced number of suppliers by selecting
those with a leading position in the relevant markets. In addition, Stellantis formed various partnerships this year in an effort
to secure specific critical raw materials, including but not limited to, nickel, cobalt, lithium, manganese. Some supply
agreements include take or pay conditions or investments in the supplier’s equity. Refer to Note 26, Guarantees granted,
commitments and contingent liabilities for additional information.

Stellantis continued to experience production losses in 2022 as a result of unfilled semiconductor orders and
shortages of certain key components. Stellantis also experienced a significant increase in the cost of raw materials which has
partially been mitigated with merger synergies. Stellantis regularly sources some of its systems, components, parts,
equipment and tooling from a single provider or limited number of providers. As with unfilled semiconductor orders in 2022,
we are at risk of production delays and lost production should any supplier fail to deliver goods and services on time. In
addition, although we have recently entered into several significant agreements with battery and raw material suppliers, as we
implement our vehicle electrification strategy, our dependence on a significant supply of battery components and related raw
materials will also increase. See also “Risk Factors - We face risks associated with increases in costs, disruptions of supply or
shortages of raw materials, parts, components and systems used in our vehicles.” and “Risk Factors - The coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic could continue to disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products and the provision of our services
and adversely impact our business.”


--- Page 23 ---

Supply of raw materials, parts and components can also be disrupted or interrupted by natural disasters. In such
circumstances, Stellantis works proactively with suppliers to identify material and part shortages and take steps to mitigate
their impact by deploying additional personnel, accessing alternative sources of supply and managing its production
schedules. Stellantis also continues to refine processes to identify emerging capacity constraints in the supplier tiers given the
ramp up in manufacturing volumes to meet volume targets. Furthermore, Stellantis continuously monitors supplier
performance according to key metrics such as part quality, delivery, performance, financial solvency and sustainability.

Stellantis employees are free to join any trade union, provided they do so in accordance with local laws and the rules
of the related trade union. Local collective agreements are led by the regions and/or countries which take the global Company
polices into account and reflect local particularities. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 88 percent of our employees
were covered by collective bargaining agreements.

An active dialogue has been maintained in 2022 with various employee representation bodies existing at the national
or transnational level. This is represented in Europe through the European Works Councils of PSA, Fiat and Opel and
Vauxhall, in North America through the union, UAW and in Canada through the union, Unifor.

Trade Unions and Collective Bargaining

Stellantis’ social relations strategy is based on six commitments:

¢  Stellantis supports the principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the

provision of a decent equitable work environment. We work towards providing competitive and living wages

and have contracted with the Fair Wage network, an independent, recognized authority on fair and living wages;

stakeholders.

The Company endorses the International Labor Organization’s (“ILO”) declaration on fundamental principles and
rights at work.

In 2022, approximately 582 collective agreements were in place worldwide.


--- Page 25 ---

Stellantis is committed to enacting a high-quality collective agreements strategy, based on a sound understanding of
the Company, seeking out innovative solutions and demonstrating a capacity to reconcile the Company’s economic and social
challenges. During 2022, these included:

* Official launch of a negotiation body to install a common unique European Works Council;

+ In Germany, an agreement to merge the commercial operations into one Stellantis National Sales Company and
to align the working conditions of its employees;

+ In Poland, a new collective framework agreement for the new LCV plant; and

+ Various agreements in Morocco, Argentina and Brazil.

Sales Overview

New vehicle sales represent sales of vehicles primarily by dealers and distributors, or, directly by us in some cases,
to retail customers and fleet customers. Sales include mass-market and luxury vehicles manufactured at our plants, as well as
vehicles manufactured by joint ventures and third party contract manufacturers and distributed under our brands. Sales
figures exclude sales of vehicles that we contract manufacture for other OEMs. While vehicle sales are illustrative of our
competitive position and the demand for our vehicles, sales are not directly correlated to Net revenues, Cost of revenues or
other measures of financial performance in any given period, as such results were primarily driven by vehicle shipments to
dealers and distributors or to retail and fleet customers. For a discussion of our shipments, see FINANCIAL OVERVIEW—
Shipment Information. Sales and market shares for 2020 reported in the tables below are the aggregation of FCA and PSA
while 2021 also includes FCA for the period from January | to January 16, prior to the merger. Figures in all tables
represented in this section may not add due to rounding. Additionally, prior period figures have been updated to reflect
current information provided by third party industry sources.

U.S. industry sales, including medium and heavy-duty vehicles, in addition to commercial vehicles, were down 1.3
million units in 2022 from 15.4 million units in 2021. Despite an increasing supply of semiconductor chips that affected 2021
sales growth, the industry sales decline in 2022 was due to headwinds driven by inflation, low consumer confidence, pricing
actions and continuing supply chain and production challenges.

Our vehicle line-up in the North America segment primarily leveraged the brand recognition of the Jeep, Ram,
Dodge and Chrysler brands to offer utility vehicles, pickup trucks, cars and minivans under those brands. Vehicle sales and
profitability in the North America segment were generally weighted towards larger vehicles such as utility vehicles, trucks
and vans, consistent with overall industry sales trends in the North America segment, which have become increasingly
weighted towards utility vehicles and trucks in recent years.

The decrease in our 2022 sales compared to 2021 resulted primarily from continuing production headwinds due to
supply chain issues, pricing actions and headwinds driven by inflation. The Company did see pent-up demand for Jeep and
Ram brand vehicles. Product highlights in 2022 include the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe electric plug-in
models, in addition to strong demand for the Jeep Compass, Ram commercial vehicles, Dodge Charger, Chrysler Pacifica,
and the Grand Wagoneer/Wagoneer.

North America Distribution

In the North America segment, our vehicles are sold primarily to dealers in our dealer network for sale to retail
consumers and to fleet customers. Fleet sales in the commercial channel are typically more profitable than sales in the
government and daily rental channels since they more often involve customized vehicles with more optional features and
accessories; however, vehicle orders in the commercial channel are usually smaller in size than the orders made in the daily
rental channel. Fleet sales in the government channel are generally more profitable than fleet sales in the daily rental channel
primarily due to the mix of products included in each respective channel.

North America Dealer and Customer Financing

In the North America segment, on November 1, 2021, Stellantis acquired First Investors Financial Services Group,
which has been renamed Stellantis Financial Services US Corp (“Stellantis Financial Services U.S.”). Stellantis Financial
Services U.S. will provide U.S. customers and dealers with a complete range of financing options in the near-to-medium
term, including retail loans, leases, and floorplan financing. However, while Stellantis Financial Services U.S. grows,
Stellantis also utilizes independent financial service providers, including Santander Consumer USA Ince. (“SCUSA”) to
provide financing for dealers and retail customers in the U.S. In February 2013, FCA entered into a private label financing
agreement with SCUSA (the “SCUSA Agreement”), under which SCUSA will continue to provide a wide range of wholesale
and retail financial services to dealers and retail customers in the U.S., under the Chrysler Capital brand name. In April 2022,
the SCUSA Agreement was amended and extended through 2025, allowing SCUSA to serve a complementary role to
Stellantis Financial Services U.S. Under the SCUSA Agreement, SCUSA has certain rights, including limited exclusivity to
participate in specified minimum percentages of certain retail financing subvention programs.

As of December 31, 2022, of the current approximately 2,600 Stellantis dealers in the U.S., SCUSA provided
wholesale lines of credit to approximately 9 percent of the dealers while Ally provided 29 percent. For the 2022 sales year,
approximately 80.4 percent of the retail vehicles sold to U.S. retail customers were financed or leased. Of those financed or
leased retail sales, SCUSA, Ally, and Stellantis Financial Services U.S. (still in start-up phase) market share represented 30.5
percent, 13.4 percent, and 1.2 percent respectively.

In Mexico, we have a private label agreement with Banco Inbursa Group in order to provide dealer and retail
customer financing programs.

Following the decision of Stellantis to regroup all financing activities in Mexico for all brands under the partnership
with Inbursa, a share purchase agreement was signed in November 2021, by Banque PSA Finance (“BPF”) with Grupo
Financiero Inbursa for the acquisition by the latter of the entire share capital of BPF Finance México S.A. de C.V., SOFOM.
The sale was completed on December 14, 2022, following the obtaining of necessary authorization by the Mexican
competent authorities.

In 2022, the automotive industry in the Europe 30 decreased by 6.2 percent as compared to 2021 due to supply
constraints and the impact of the war in Ukraine.

The decrease of the Company's overall market share in 2022 in Europe 30 to 19.7 percent is primarily due to a 16.5
percent volume decrease. This is mainly due to a decrease of 17.6 percent in Peugeot, 20.9 percent in Fiat and 18.1 percent in
Citroén. This is offset by marked increases in DS and Alfa Romeo.

Showing the unique strength of our product portfolio, the Company has 4 of the top 10 models based on sales in the
Europe 30: Peugeot 208 at number 1, Fiat 500 at number 6, Opel/Vauxhall Corsa at number 7 and Citroén C3 at number 8.

In 2022, Stellantis reinforced its sales leadership in Passenger Cars (“PC”) and LCV being number | in France,
Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Greece. We also consolidated our leadership in the LCV segment in Europe 30 with a
market share of 30.6 percent.

Stellantis continues to accelerate towards electrification: we are the leader in LEV (PC and LCV) in France, Italy,
Spain and Portugal.

In Enlarged Europe, our sales are largely weighted to passenger cars, with an estimated 65.0 percent of total vehicle
sales in the small car segment (A and B segments) for 2022. This reflects the demand for smaller vehicles due to driving
conditions prevalent in many European cities and stringent environmental regulations.

Enlarged Europe Distribution

In Europe, our relationship with individual dealer entities may be represented by a number of contracts (typically,
we enter into one agreement per brand of vehicles to be sold), and the dealer can sell those vehicles through one or more
points of sale.

We sell our vehicles directly to independent and our owned dealer entities located in most European markets, as well
as to fleet customers (including government and rental). In other markets and in segments in which we do not have a
substantial presence, we have agreements with general distributors.

During 2021, Stellantis engaged in a transformation process by terminating its distribution contracts and at the same
time consulting its networks on the future distribution model. This process was undertaken in anticipation of implementing
new distribution schemes starting July 2023.

Enlarged Europe Dealer and Customer Financing

In the Enlarged Europe segment, dealer and retail customer financing is managed by FCA Bank, a 50 percent joint
venture with Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance S.A. (“CACF”) as for the former FCA brands (Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Dodge,
Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Chrysler, Maserati and Ram), and by BPF as for the former PSA brands (through two partnerships
described below). FCA Bank operates in Europe, including the five major markets of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the
UK, and provides dealer and retail financing and, within selected countries, also rentals to support the former FCA vehicle
brands. FCA Bank provides its services to the Maserati luxury brand, as well as certain other OEMs, including Ferrari. The
joint venture with CACF was initially entered into in 2006 and was thereafter renewed with a term extended through
December 31, 2024. BPF operates through two 50 percent joint ventures under the umbrella of two major partnerships in
Europe, one with Group Santander Consumer Finance (“SCF”) for the Peugeot, Citroén and DS brands, and one with BNP
Paribas Personal Finance (“BNPP PF”) for the Opel and Vauxhall brands. The partnership with SCF began in 2015 with an
initial duration of 10 years and with BNPP PF in 2017 with an initial duration of 12 years.

On December 17, 2021, Stellantis announced the intention to reorganize its leasing activities in Europe with the
intention to create a European multi-brand operational leasing company with CACF, (with each of Stellantis and CACF
holding a 50 percent interest) that would result from the combination of the leasing activities of Leasys, a subsidiary
transferred at December 31, 2022, from FCA Bank to LeaseCo, a joint venture held 50 percent by both Stellantis and CACF,
and the activities of Free2Move Lease (“F2ML”), a business unit created within the former Groupe PSA and which aims to
develop the business to business (““B2B”) long-term leasing activity. In addition, the joint ventures with BNPP PF and SCF
are planned to be reorganized so the joint ventures with BNPP PF will operate financing activities in Germany, Austria and in
the UK and joint ventures with SCF will operate financing activities in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Poland, the Netherlands
and through a commercial agreement with SCF in Portugal. The joint ventures’ financing activities will cover all Stellantis
brands. The binding agreements governing this reorganization were signed on March 31, 2022, between Stellantis and each of
BNP Paribas Personal Finance, Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance and Santander Consumer Finance and the proposed
transactions are targeted to be completed during the first half of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals including from relevant
authorities and market regulators.

Sales activities within certain Eastern European countries are supported by private label agreements with local banks
covering both the wholesale and retail financing needs.

Maserati excluded from volumes and market share of the region

In 2022, the total industry volume of Middle East & Africa slightly decreased by 0.8 percent, despite growth in the
Middle East and South Africa markets. Both the Egyptian and Algerian markets decreased by 42.0 percent and 23.9 percent,
respectively, as a result of supply constraints and the sensitivity around the geopolitical environments. Despite these
headwinds, the Company increased its sales volumes by 1.1 percent with 4.4 thousand more deliveries and market share gains
in most of the major countries.

Overall market share of the region reached 12.0 percent, up by 20 basis points compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily due to positive performance in Turkey, Overseas France, South Africa, Israel, Algeria and Tunisia. Despite being
one of the main market brands in Egypt and Algeria, we were limited by supply availability during the year.

Commercial vehicle sales increased by 3.0 percent, up to 108 thousand units, or 15.1 percent market share. Stellantis
secured its number two commercial vehicles position in the region.

Automotive industry volumes within the countries in which the South America segment operates increased by 2.7
percent to 3.6 million vehicles (PC and LCV) in 2022 as compared to 2021, which was primarily driven by the unfilled
semiconductor orders which limited vehicle production in 2021. Overall, there was a 0.8 percent decrease in the industry in
Brazil, reflecting the unfilled semiconductor orders, which has affected the production capacity, and a 7.0 percent increase in
the industry in Argentina, reflecting the gradual recovery of sales.

Stellantis’ market share in South America increased 30 basis points from 22.9 percent in 2021 to 23.2 percent in
2022, primarily reflecting market share growth in Brazil, with Fiat as the brand leader. In Brazil, overall market share
increased 90 basis point to 32.9 percent in 2022 from 32.0 percent in 2021 while, in Argentina, overall market share increased
160 basis point to 30.7 percent in 2022 from 29.1 percent in 2021.


--- Page 34 ---

Our vehicle line-up in South America leverages the brand recognition of Fiat, as well as the relatively urban
population of countries like Brazil, and offers vehicles in smaller segments, such as the Fiat Argo as well as the Fiat Mobi.
Fiat also led the pickup truck market in Brazil, with the Fiat Strada and the Fiat Toro (both represent a total of 49.9 percent
market share in the segment). Jeep achieved 7.0 percent of the total sales in Brazil and led the SUV segment with 20.0
percent of market share primarily based on the performance of the Jeep Renegade, the Jeep Compass and the Jeep
Commander. Peugeot and Citroén are conquering new consumers and sales grew 41.5 percent and 37.6 percent, respectively
compared to 2021.

South America Distribution

In South America, law in each country regulates retail vehicle distribution. In Brazil and Argentina, distribution is
through dealers of each brand, although it is common for the same distributor to have several stores in order to offer different
brands. In other countries, distribution is through multi-brands importers or dealers.

South America Dealer and Customer Financing

In the South America segment, we provide access to dealer and retail customer financing as well as rental products
through 100 percent owned captive finance companies and also through strategic relationships with financial institutions.

We have three 100 percent owned captive finance companies in the South America segment that offer dealer and
retail customer financing as well as rental services: Banco Fidis S.A. (“Banco Fidis”) and FCA Rental Locadora de
Automoveis Ltda (commercially known as Flua) in Brazil and FCA Compajiia Financiera S.A. in Argentina. We also have
two 50 percent owned joint ventures that offer dealer and retail customer financing, PSA Finance Argentina Compafia
Financiera S.A., with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. owning the other 50 percent, and Banco PSA Finance Brasil
S.A., with Banco Santander Brasil S.A. owning the other 50 percent.

In November 2022, two contracts were signed with Banco Santander Brasil S.A. to purchase its 50 percent shares of
both Banco PSA Finance Brasil S.A., a finance company, and PSA Corretora de Seguros e Services Ltd., a company
providing insurance services. Both of these contracts are 50/50 joint ventures with Banco Santander Brasil S.A. The closings
of those two deals are expected to happen before the end of 2023. In addition, in Brazil we have two significant commercial
partnerships with Banco Itai and Bradesco to provide financing to retail customers purchasing our branded vehicles. Banco
Itau is a leading vehicle retail financing company in Brazil and our partnership was renewed in August 2013 for a ten-year
term ending in 2023. Under this agreement, which applied only to our retail customers purchasing Fiat branded vehicles,
Banco Itau has exclusivity on our promotional campaigns and preferential rights on non-promotional financing. We receive
commissions in connection with each vehicle financing above a certain threshold. In July 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automoveis
Brasil (“FCA Brasil”) and Banco Fidis signed a ten-year partnership contract with Bradesco, one of the leading Brazilian
banks, through its affiliate Bradesco Financiamentos, whereby Bradesco Financiamentos finances retail sales of Jeep,
Chrysler, Dodge and Ram vehicles in Brazil. Under this agreement, Bradesco has exclusivity on promotional campaigns and
FCA Brasil promotes Bradesco as FCA Brasil’s official financial partner. Banco Fidis is in charge of the commercial
management of this partnership and receives commissions for this partnership agreement and for acting as banking agent,
based on profitability and penetration.

Maserati excluded from volumes and market share

The automotive industry in the India & Asia Pacific segment has shown a year-over-year growth, with industry sales
increased by 7.4 percent to 13.6 million units in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in demand was primarily driven by key
markets: India with an increase of 23.0 percent due to new model launches from local OEMs lifting the market, AGD with an
increase of 14.9 percent and in Australia an increase of 1.8 percent, as both markets started to recover from the
semiconductor shortage. However, South Korea experienced a decrease of 2.9 percent and Japan a decrease of 6.2 percent,
with both markets impacted negatively by unfilled semiconductor orders during the year. In 2022, 26.9 million vehicles
(passengers cars and commercial vehicles) were sold in China, which represents a 2.1 percent year-over-year increase.

We sell a range of vehicles in the China and India & Asia Pacific segment, including small and compact cars,
premium mid-size cars, utility vehicles and light commercial vehicles. Although our smallest segment by vehicle sales, China
and India & Asia Pacific segment represents a significant growth opportunity and we are invested in building relationships
with key partners in India to increase our manufacturing footprint and presence in the region. In the China and India & Asia
Pacific segment we also distribute vehicles that are manufactured in the U.S. and Europe through our dealers and distributors.

China and India & Asia Pacific Distribution

In the key markets in the China and India & Asia Pacific segment (China, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and
AGD), we sell our vehicles through 100 percent owned subsidiaries or through our joint venture, DPCA JV to local
independent dealers. On October 31, 2022, the two shareholders of the GAC-Stellantis JV have approved a resolution
authorizing the JV to file for bankruptcy. Stellantis will focus on distributing imported vehicles for the Jeep brand in China
through an asset-light approach. The Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Automobile Sales Co (“DPCS”) markets the vehicles
produced by DPCA in China. We operate through national sales companies in Australia, Japan, India and South Korea. In
AGD and smaller markets, we have agreements with general distributors.


--- Page 36 ---

China and India & Asia Pacific Dealer and Customer Financing

In China, we operate a 100 percent owned captive finance company, FCA Automotive Finance Co., Ltd, which
supports our sales activities in China through dealer and retail customer financing. Cooperation agreements are also in place
with third-party financial institutions to provide dealer network and retail customer financing in India, South Korea, Australia
and Japan.

In 2022, Stellantis and Dongfeng Motor Group (“Dongfeng”) agreed to reshape the relationships initially established
through two joint finance companies, namely Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Auto Finance Company Ltd (“DPCAFC”) and
Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Financial Leasing Co (“DPCFLC”), which provide the financing of the Dongfeng Peugeot and
Dongfeng Citroén brands in China as well as leasing solutions. This resulted in the signature of two equity transfer
agreements, one relating to the acquisition by Dongfeng of all of the equity shares held in DPCAFC by Stellantis and by
DPCA JV, and one relating to the acquisition by Stellantis of all of the equity shares held in DPCFLC by Dongfeng.
Following the signature of these two agreements, the acquisition by Dongfeng of the entire equity shares in DPCAFC
occurred on December 15, 2022. The acquisition by Stellantis of Dongfeng’s equity shares held in DPCFLC is expected to
close in the first half of 2023 after the necessary regulatory approvals.

Maserati
In 2022, Maserati launched the all-new Grecale SUV which is available in three versions (GT, Modena and Trofeo)
and with a wide choice of propulsion systems, from conventional combustion to hybrid engines. In addition, Maserati

revealed the spyder version of its MC20: Maserati MC20 Cielo, with a retractable hard top.

The following table shows the distribution of Maserati sales by geographic regions and as a percentage of total sales
for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:

In 2022, a total of 23.4 thousand Maserati vehicles were sold, slightly lower compared to 2021 as a result of sales
performance in China mainly due to pandemic restrictions partially offset by significant increase in Europe and other key
markets as a result of the Grecale launch.

FCA Bank provides access to dealer and retail customer financing for Maserati brand vehicles in Europe and our
100 percent owned captive finance company, FCA Automotive Finance Co. Ltd, provides dealer and retail financing in
China. In the U.S., JPM Chase provides retail financing. In other regions, we rely on local agreements with financial services
providers for the financing of Maserati brand vehicles to dealers and end customers.

Cyclical Nature of the Business

As is typical in the automotive industry, Stellantis’ vehicle sales are highly sensitive to general economic conditions,
availability of low interest rate vehicle financing for dealers and retail customers and other external factors, including fuel
prices, and as a result could vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year. Retail consumers tend to delay the
purchase of a new vehicle when disposable income and consumer confidence is low. Moreover, increases in inflation may
lead to subsequent increases in the cost of borrowing and availability of affordable credit for vehicle financing, which may
further influence retail consumers to delay the purchase of a new vehicle. In addition, Stellantis’ vehicle production volumes
and related revenues could vary from month to month, sometimes due to plant shutdowns, which could occur for several
reasons including raw material or component unavailability, production changes from one model year to the next and actions
to balance vehicle supply and demand fluctuations and also to adjust dealer stock levels appropriately. Plant shutdowns,
whether associated with model year changeovers or other factors such as temporary supplier interruptions, could have a
negative impact on Stellantis’ revenues and working capital as Stellantis continues to pay suppliers under established terms
while Stellantis would not receive proceeds from vehicle sales. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity
Overview for additional information.

Legal Proceedings
Takata airbag inflators

Putative class action lawsuits were filed in March 2018 against FCA US LLC (“FCA US”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Stellantis, in the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of Florida and the Eastern District of Michigan,
asserting claims under federal and state laws alleging economic loss due to Takata airbag inflators installed in certain of our
vehicles. The cases were subsequently consolidated in the Southern District of Florida. On November 8, 2022, the Court
granted summary judgement in FCA US’s favor against all claimants except those in Georgia and North Carolina. FCA US
has moved to dismiss all remaining claims and decisions on those motions are pending.

Emissions Matters

On January 10, 2019, FCA US announced it had reached final settlements on civil environmental and consumer
claims with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(“DoJ”), the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”), the State of California, 49 other States and U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, for which we accrued €748 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately €350 million of the
amount accrued by FCA US, which was prior to the merger, was related to civil penalties to resolve differences over diesel
emissions requirements. A portion of the amount accrued, prior to the merger, was attributable to settlement of a putative
class action on behalf of consumers in connection with which FCA US agreed to pay an average of $2,800 per vehicle to
eligible customers affected by the recall. That settlement received final court approval on May 3, 2019. On April 9, 2021,
FCA US reached an agreement with substantially all of the approximately 3,200 consumers that exercised their right to opt
out of the class action settlement to settle their claims for an amount that is not material to the Company.

In September 2019, the DoJ filed criminal charges against an employee of FCA US for, among other things, fraud,
conspiracy, false statements and violations of the Clean Air Act primarily in connection with efforts to obtain regulatory
approval of the vehicles that were the subject of the civil settlements described above. In April 2021, two additional
employees of a Stellantis subsidiary were indicted by the DoJ on similar charges. The three employees were placed on
administrative leave following their indictments. On June 3, 2022, FCA US announced that it had agreed to a settlement to
resolve the DoJ, Criminal Division’s investigation as it relates to FCA US. The settlement, which received court approval,
includes a guilty plea, a fine of approximately $96 million, and the forfeiture of approximately $204 million in gains. Prior to
the merger, we accrued approximately €200 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as our best estimate
of probable loss with regard to matters under discussion. In light of subsequent progress in our discussions with the DoJ,
Criminal Division, we increased our accrual for this matter to approximately €266 million as of December 31, 2021, which is
sufficient to cover the forfeiture and penalty imposed by the plea agreement. We remain subject to a number of related
private lawsuits (the “Non Opt-Out Litigation”).

We have also received inquiries from other regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions as they examine the
on-road tailpipe emissions of several automakers’ vehicles and, when jurisdictionally appropriate, we continue to cooperate
with these governmental agencies and authorities.


--- Page 38 ---

In Europe, we have continued to work with the Italian Ministry of Transport (“MIT”) and the Dutch Vehicle
Regulator (“RDW”), the authorities that certified FCA diesel vehicles for sale in the European Union, and the UK Driver and
Vehicle Standards Agency in connection with their review of several diesel models.

We also responded to inquiries from the German authority, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (“KBA”), regarding emissions
test results for FCA diesel vehicles, and discussed the KBA reported test results, our emission control calibrations and the
features of the vehicles in question. After these initial discussions, the MIT, which has sole authority for regulatory
compliance of the vehicles it has certified, asserted its exclusive jurisdiction over the matters raised by the KBA, tested the
vehicles, determined that the vehicles complied with applicable European regulations and informed the KBA of its
determination. Thereafter, mediations were held under European Commission (“EC”) rules, between the MIT and the
German Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, which oversees the KBA, in an effort to resolve their differences.
The mediation concluded and no action was taken with respect to FCA. In May 2017, the EC announced its intention to open
an infringement procedure against Italy regarding Italy's alleged failure to respond to EC's concerns regarding certain FCA
emission control calibrations. The MIT responded to the EC's allegations by confirming that the vehicles' approval process
was properly performed. On December 2, 2021, the EC notified Italy of its position that Italy did not comply with its
obligation to enforce EU emission type approval rules.

In December 2019, the MIT notified FCA of communications with the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water
Management (“I&W”) regarding certain irregularities allegedly found by the RDW and the Dutch Center of Research TNO in
the emission levels of certain Jeep Grand Cherokee Euro 5 models and a vehicle model of another OEM containing a Euro 6
diesel engine supplied by FCA. In January 2020, the Dutch Parliament published a letter from the I&W summarizing the
conclusions of the RDW regarding those vehicles and engines and indicating an intention to order a recall and report their
findings to the Public Prosecutor, the EC and other Member States. FCA engaged with the RDW to present our positions and
cooperate to reach an appropriate resolution of this matter. FCA proposed certain updates to the relevant vehicles that have
been tested and approved by the RDW and are now being implemented. Nevertheless, this matter is still pending.

In addition, as part of the judicial investigation of several automakers in France, commencing in 2016 and 2017,
Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroén were placed under examination by the Judicial Court of Paris in June 2021 on
allegations of consumer fraud in connection with the sale of Euro 5 diesel vehicles in France between 2009 and 2015. In July
2021, FCA Italy was placed under examination by the same court for possible consumer fraud in connection with the sale of
Euro 6 diesel vehicles in France between 2014 and 2017. FCA Italy was also designated as a material witness in connection
with allegations of obstruction of the actions of an economy ministry antifraud inspector in 2016 and 2017. As is typical in a
French criminal inquiry, each of the companies were required to pay bail for the potential payment of damages and fines and
to ensure representation in court, and to provide a guarantee for the potential compensation of losses. None of these amounts
were, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company.

In July 2020, unannounced inspections took place at several of FCA’s sites in Germany, Italy and the UK at the
initiative of the Public Prosecutors of Frankfurt am Main and of Turin, as part of their investigations of potential violations of
diesel emissions regulations and consumer protection laws. In April 2022, former FCA companies received an order to
produce documents to the Public Prosecutors. In October 2022, inspections took place at the Italian offices of FCA Italy and
Maserati and at the German office of Maserati Deutschland. The Public Prosecutor of Frankfurt has also informed us that it is
conducting a criminal investigation regarding the emissions of certain PSA diesel engines installed in approximately 1,000
PSA vehicles and 29,000 Mitsubishi vehicles sold in Germany. We continue to cooperate with these investigations.

We also face class actions and individual claims in several European countries. Several former FCA and PSA
companies and our Dutch dealers have been served with two class actions filed in the Netherlands by Dutch foundations
seeking monetary damages and vehicle buybacks in connection with alleged emissions non-compliance of certain diesel
vehicles. We have also been notified of a potential class action on behalf of Dutch consumers alleging emissions non-
compliance of certain former FCA vehicles sold as recreational vehicles, as well as a securities class action in the
Netherlands, alleging misrepresentations by FCA, now Stellantis. A class action alleging emissions non-compliance has also
been filed in Portugal regarding former FCA vehicles and similar claims in the UK regarding former FCA and PSA vehicles
are in a pre-litigation phase. We are also defending approximately 11,300 individual consumer claims alleging emissions
non-compliance of certain former FCA vehicles in Germany and approximately 150 in Austria.

In December 2018, the Korean Ministry of Environment (“MOE”) announced its determination that approximately
2,400 FCA vehicles imported into Korea during 2015, 2016 and 2017 were not emissions compliant and that the vehicles
with a subsequent update of the emission control calibrations voluntarily performed by FCA, although compliant, would have
required re-homologation of the vehicles concerned. In May 2019, the MOE revoked certification of the above-referenced
vehicles and announced an administrative fine for an amount not material to the Company which has been paid by our
Korean subsidiary. Our appeal of the MOE’s decision was rejected and we are no longer pursuing appeals other than in
connection with calculation of the fine. Our Korean subsidiary has also paid an administrative fine, in an amount not material
to the Company, imposed by the Korean Fair Trade Commission for a purported breach of the Act on Fair Labeling and
Advertisement in connection with these vehicles.

In November 2021, the MOE issued notice of its intention to impose a recall order, revocation of certification and an
administrative fine on the basis of the alleged non-compliance of approximately 2,250 other FCA vehicles. The amount of the
administrative fine is not material to the Company. We are waiting for the MOE to issue the final disposition on this matter.
Our subsidiary in Seoul, Korea is also cooperating with local criminal authorities in connection with their review of these
matters. In both cases, the authorities decided to not refer the matter to prosecutors, as they had found no evidence of
wrongdoing by our Korean subsidiary.

National Training Center

On January 27, 2021, FCA US announced an agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of
Michigan to resolve its investigation into past misconduct of certain former FCA US employees involving the UAW-Chrysler
National Training Center (“NTC”). Pursuant to the agreement, which received court approval on July 19, 2021, FCA US
agreed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to violate the Labor Management Relations Act and the payment of a
fine in an amount that is not material to the Company and which was accrued prior to the merger. FCA US also agreed to
implement an independent compliance monitor for three years with respect to the dissolution of the NTC and internal controls
as they relate to the trusts being implemented to replace the NTC.

Several putative class action lawsuits have been filed against FCA US in U.S. federal court alleging harm to UAW
workers as a result of these acts. Those actions have been dismissed both at the trial court stage and on appeal. Three
plaintiffs in these lawsuits also filed charges alleging unfair labor practices with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (the
“Board”). The Board issued a complaint regarding these allegations and sought a cease and desist order as well as the posting
of a notification with respect to the alleged practices, but subsequently dismissed the charges.

On July 20, 2020, a group of employees in FCA’s Toledo, Ohio Jeep plant filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Ohio against FCA US, the UAW and certain individuals claiming violations of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (“RICO”) Act and civil conspiracy. On October 20, 2020, FCA US filed a motion to
dismiss. Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on June 25, 2021. Briefing on the motion to dismiss has been stayed
pending decisions on motions to dismiss in two related cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

On October 16, 2020 and February 28, 2021, lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan, by groups of current and former employees making similar claims. The court granted our motion to dismiss one of
the cases and that decision has been appealed by plaintiffs. Our motion to dismiss the other case remains pending.

General Motors Litigation

On November 20, 2019, General Motors LLC and General Motors Company (collectively, “GM”) filed a lawsuit in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against FCA US, FCA N.V., now Stellantis N.V., and certain
individuals, claiming violations of the RICO Act, unfair competition and civil conspiracy in connection with allegations that
FCA US made payments to UAW officials that corrupted the bargaining process with the UAW and as a result FCA US
enjoyed unfair labor costs and operational advantages that caused harm to GM. GM also claimed that FCA US had made
concessions to the UAW in collective bargaining that the UAW was then able to extract from GM through pattern bargaining
which increased costs to GM and that this was done by FCA US in an effort to force a merger between GM and FCA N.V.
The court dismissed GM’s lawsuit with prejudice. GM subsequently appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit the court affirmed the dismissal of GM’s complaint. On January 9, 2023, GM filed a petition with the U.S.
Supreme Court, seeking review of the Sixth Circuit’s decision.


--- Page 40 ---

Following dismissal of its Federal court case, GM filed an action against FCA US and FCA N.V., now Stellantis
N.V., in Michigan state court, making substantially the same claims as it made in the federal litigation. On October 15, 2021,
the court granted Stellantis N.V. and FCA US’s motion for summary disposition. GM filed a motion for reconsideration and
on December 6, 2021, the court granted GM’s motion, permitting GM to amend its complaint. GM filed a second amended
complaint on December 23, 2021. On May 16, 2022, the court denied FCA US’s motion for summary disposition and
permitted discovery to proceed against FCA US. On July 20, 2022, the court granted Stellantis N.V.’s motion for summary
disposition, but on November 28, 2022 the court granted GM’s motion for reconsideration and permitted jurisdictional
discovery to proceed against Stellantis N.V..

Tigershark Engine

In addition, putative class action lawsuits have been filed against FCA US and consolidated into a single action in
U.S. District court in Michigan asserting claims under federal and state laws claiming manufacturing and design defects in
certain vehicles equipped with the 2.4L Tigershark engine, which has been installed in approximately 1.6 million vehicles
sold in the U.S. The claims allege excessive oil consumption and related excess emissions. In November 2021, we entered
into an agreement in principle to settle the litigation, contingent on court approval, for an amount that is not material to the
Company. The court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2022.

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters

At Stellantis, we engineer, manufacture and sell our products and offer our services around the world, subject to
requirements applicable to our products that relate to vehicle emissions, fuel economy, emission control software calibration
and on-board diagnostics and vehicle safety, as well as those applicable to our manufacturing facilities that relate to stack
emissions, the management of waste, water and hazardous materials, prohibitions on soil contamination, and worker health
and safety. Our vehicles and the propulsion systems that power them must also comply with extensive regional, national and
local laws and regulations (including those that regulate end-of-life vehicles (“ELVs”) and the chemical content of our parts).
In addition, vehicle safety regulations are becoming increasingly strict.

We are subject to a range of global regulatory requirements affecting our facilities and products, and compliance
with these requirements involves significant costs and risks. We consistently monitor the relevant global regulatory
requirements affecting our facilities and products and adjust our operations and processes as we seek to remain in
compliance, although we may from time to time fail to meet a particular regulatory requirement. See “‘Risk Factors-Risks
Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate-Current and more stringent future or incremental
laws, regulations and governmental policies, including those regarding increased fuel efficiency requirements and reduced
greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions, have a significant effect on how we do business and may increase our cost of
compliance, result in additional liabilities and negatively affect our operations and results.” and “Risk Factors-Risks Related
to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate-We remain subject to ongoing diesel emissions investigations
by several governmental agencies and to a number of related private lawsuits, which may lead to further claims, lawsuits and
enforcement actions, and result in additional penalties, settlements or damage awards and may also adversely affect our
reputation with consumers.”

Automotive Tailpipe Emissions

Numerous laws and regulations place limits on vehicle emissions, including standards on tailpipe exhaust emissions
standards and evaporative emissions. These standards govern a category of emissions called “criteria emissions” that does not
include greenhouse gases (““GHGs’”). Related laws impose requirements on how vehicles’ emission control systems are
designed to ensure emissions are controlled in normal, real driving conditions, as well as requirements to employ diagnostic
software to identify and diagnose problems with emission control components, which if undiagnosed could lead to higher
emissions. This diagnostic software is called an on-board diagnostic system (“OBD”).

All global jurisdictions require manufacturers to conduct vehicle testing to demonstrate compliance with these
emissions limits for the useful life of a vehicle as a prerequisite to obtaining emission compliance certification before any
vehicle can be sold.

These requirements become more challenging each year, especially in light of increased global scrutiny of diesel
emission control systems and we expect these emissions and certification requirements will continue to become even more
rigorous worldwide.

North America Region

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has established federal Tier 3 emissions standards, and federal
law allows the CARB to also establish its Low Emission Vehicle (“LEV”) III emission standards. CARB is now in the
process of adopting Advanced Clean Car II Regulations (“ACC II”), which will establish revised standards for new 2026 and
subsequent model year California light-duty vehicles.

EPA and CARB both review manufacturers’ emission control software design as part of their emission certification
evaluation, whereas EPA has delegated the administration of OBD software requirements to CARB.

In addition to its LEV III emissions standards, CARB regulations also require that a specified percentage of cars and
certain light-duty trucks sold in California qualify as zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles
or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. ACC II will require that ZEV sales increase to 100 percent of new vehicle sales by the 2035
model year. Federal law further allows other states to adopt CARB’s criteria emission, GHG and ZEV standards. Other states
have adopted or are in the process of adopting CARB standards.


--- Page 42 ---

Manufacturers must comply with EPA’s and CARB’s criteria emission standards at a vehicle-level as well as a
sales-weighted fleet level, whereas CARB’s ZEV requirements, to the extent enforceable, are fleet-only standards.

For a discussion of inquiries into our compliance with certain regulations in the U.S., see Note 26, Guarantees
granted, commitments and contingent liabilities within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report. See also “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which we Operate-Current and
future more stringent or incremental laws, regulations and governmental policies, including those regarding increased fuel
efficiency requirements and reduced greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions, have a significant effect on how we do business
and may increase our cost of compliance and negatively affect our operations and results.”

Enlarged Europe Region

In Europe, emissions are regulated by the European Union (“EU”) and the United Nations Economic Commission
for Europe (“UNECE”). The EC imposes standardized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27 EU member
states, while non-EU countries bound by the “1958 UN Agreement” (an agreement concerning the adoption of uniform
technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted or used on wheeled vehicles and the
conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions) apply regulations under the
UNECE framework. EU Member States can provide tax incentives/contributions for the purchase of vehicles that are rated as
zero emission vehicles (such as BEVs) or for vehicles that meet emission standards earlier than the compliance date. Vehicles
must meet emission requirements and receive specific approval from an appropriate Member State authority before they can
be sold in any EU Member State, and these regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and
market surveillance testing of vehicles in the field for emission compliance.

Euro 6 emission levels are currently in effect for all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles which required
additional technologies and increased the cost of diesel engines compared to prior Euro 5 standards. These new technologies
have put additional cost pressures on the already challenging European market for small and mid-size diesel-powered
vehicles. Further requirements of Euro 6 have been developed by the EU and are effective for all new passenger cars and
light commercial vehicles. In addition to WLTP, the new real driving emissions (“RDE”) test procedure to directly assess the
regulated emissions of light duty vehicles under real driving conditions is effective. More stringent test requirements related
to RDE, as well as requirements relating to On-board Fuel and/or Energy Consumption Monitoring Device for Fuel
Consumption Monitoring, is effective for all new passenger cars registered after January 1, 2021 and all new light
commercial vehicles registered after January 1, 2022.

For a discussion of inquiries from relevant governmental agencies in the European Union, see Note 26, Guarantees
granted, commitments and contingent liabilities within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report. See also “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which we Operate-We remain
subject to diesel emissions investigations by several governmental agencies and to a number of related private lawsuits, as
well as other claims and lawsuits which may lead to further enforcement actions, penalties or damage awards and may also
adversely affect our reputation with consumers”

South America Region

Certain countries in South America follow U.S. procedures, standards and OBD requirements, while others follow
the European procedures, standards and onboard diagnostic requirements described above. In Brazil, vehicle emission
standards are regulated by the Ministry of the Environment and have been in place since 1988 for passenger cars and light
commercial vehicles (PROCONVE). The current phase of regulations (PROCONVE L7) set new fuel efficiency and safety
standards from January 2022 and a next step (PROCONVE L8) will come into effect in January 2025 with fleet target limits
(US BIN methodology) and RDE limits. Argentina has implemented regulations that mirror the EU Euro 5 standards for all
new vehicles. In Chile, implementation of Euro 6 standards occurred in 2022 for new homologations and will go into effect in
2023 for all licensed vehicles.


--- Page 43 ---

China and India & Asia Pacific Region

China 6 standards were released in 2016 and were applied nationwide, beginning in January 2021, with China 6a
thresholds and will be updated by July 2023 with China 6b thresholds. China 6a and 6b have more stringent tailpipe
emissions thresholds than Euro 6, implement OBD requirements similar to U.S. OBD II and evaporative emission control
requirements, and add RDE and U.S. onboard refueling vapor recovery requirements. Prior to July 2023, RDE is required for
monitoring only and the emission durability mileage is set at 160,000 kilometers. Beginning July 2023, RDE conformity
factor 2.1 will be implemented and emission durability mileage will be extended to 200,000 kilometers. Some regions within
China implemented China 6b in 2019 such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta,
Chengdu, Chongqing and Tianjin. Beijing implemented China 6b at the beginning of 2020.

South Korea implemented regulations that are similar to California’s LEV III regulations beginning in 2016 and
became fully required in 2019 for all gasoline vehicles. Diesel vehicles are required to meet Euro 6 EU emissions
requirements. Japan adopted the WLTP without Extra High phase in 2018 for new models and for all models beginning
January 2021. WLTP is a global harmonized standard for regulating GHG emissions, non-GHG pollutants, and fuel or energy
consumption for light-duty vehicles and electric range for battery electric vehicles or hybrids.

India implemented nationwide Bharat Stage VI (“BSVI”) Emission norms (equivalent to Euro 6) in April 2020.
Stage 2 of BSVI norms (with more stringent OBD limits, RDE and an in-use performance ratio) will be implemented
beginning April 2023. The conformity Factor (“CF”) for RDE has not been confirmed but a two-stage implementation for
RDE CF (Stage | in April 2023 and Stage 2 in April 2024) is under discussion. Currently E5 fuel is the reference fuel for
BSVIL, and there is a plan to change the fuel to E20 in April 2025.

In addition, Australia is developing a revised Regulatory Impact Statement to introduce mandatory Euro 6 standards
beginning in 2027 while Euro 5 standards are expected to remain in force until that time.

Automotive Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
North America Region

In the U.S., since the enactment of the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has enforced minimum CAFE for fleets of new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold
in the U.S. for each model year. CAFE standards apply to all domestic and imported passenger car and light-duty truck fleets
and currently target year-over-year increases in fuel economy. The requirement is scaled based on vehicle footprint size. The
CAFE standards require that passenger cars imported into the U.S. from outside of North America are averaged separately
from those manufactured within North America, and domestic cars and light duty trucks are also considered separately.

In 2012, EPA promulgated its first GHG rule under the federal Clean Air Act, which required manufacturers to
comply with a similar footprint-based GHG standard, the stringency of which increases year-over-year through 2025. The
GHG tule does not require separate domestic passenger car compliance reporting but, like the CAFE program, light trucks are
reported separately from passenger cars.

In September 2019, EPA and NHTSA issued the first two parts of a new rule, which the agencies called the Safer
Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicle Rule (the “SAFE Rule”).

In April 2020, EPA and NHTSA issued SAFE Part 2, which established new GHG and CAFE standards.

In August and September 2021, EPA and NHTSA published proposed GHG and fuel economy regulations,
respectively. These regulations impose GHG and fuel economy standards that are stricter than the SAFE 2 Rule’s standards.
EPA published its final GHG regulation in December 2021, which includes stricter standards for model years 2023 through
2026. Similarly, NHTSA published its final fuel economy regulation in April 2022, which increased stringency for model
years 2024 through 2026. In addition, EPA reinstated California’s legal right to have and enforce its GHG and ZEV programs
in March 2022. For more information, please refer to “RISK MANAGEMENT - Risk Factors - Current and more stringent
future or incremental laws, regulations and governmental policies, including those regarding increased fuel efficiency
requirements and reduced greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions, have a significant effect on how we do business and may
increase our cost of compliance, result in additional liabilities and negatively affect our operations and results.”


--- Page 44 ---

In April 2022, NHTSA published a final rule repealing an interim final rule issued in January 2021 and reverting to
the December 2016 final rule which, beginning with the 2019 Model Year, increased the CAFE civil penalty rate from $5.00
to $14.00 for every tenth of a mile per gallon the new vehicles fall short of required fuel economy standards. This amount is
multiplied by the number of noncomplying vehicles sold. NHTSA is expected to continue to make mandatory inflation
adjustments to the CAFE civil penalty rate, as required by law for all civil monetary penalties. Applying the annual inflation
adjustment procedures did not result in an increase in the $14.00 rate through 2021 Model Year, but did result in an increased
fine rate to $15.00 for 2022 Model Year vehicles. For more information, refer to Note 26, Guarantees granted, commitments
and contingent liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

On March 9, 2022, the EPA reinstated California’s authority under the Clean Air Act to enforce its own, more
stringent, GHG emission standards for passenger vehicles and light duty trucks (the “California Waiver’). California
emission standards covered by the California Waiver may be adopted by other states and to date 17 other states and the
District of Columbia (the “California Waiver States”) have adopted California’s GHG emissions standards under the
California Waiver.

Prior to the EPA’s withdrawal of the California Waiver, automotive OEMs were deemed to be compliant with
California’s GHG emissions standards if they were compliant with the EPA’s GHG standards. This “deemed to comply”
mechanism was removed from the California regulation prior to the reinstatement of the California Waiver. As interpreted by
CARB, the EPA’s reinstatement of the California Waiver together with the removal of the “deemed to comply” mechanism
means that automotive OEMs are retroactively subject to the separate California GHG standards beginning with the model
year 2021 fleet. OEMs may achieve compliance with the California GHG emission standards in several ways, including
through the sale of emission-compliant vehicles within their fleet for a given model year, through the carryforward or
carryback of excess credits generated by a compliant fleet in past or future years, by the purchase of California-specific
regulatory credits from third parties or by a combination of the foregoing.

For heavy duty vehicles (>8,500 pound gross vehicle weight rating), the U.S. GHG and fuel consumption standard is
utility based (payload and towing) and is increasing in stringency through 2027.

The Canadian and Mexican markets have adopted GHG standards derived from the U.S. government’s footprint-
based structure and generally align with its technology-adoption compliance approach.

In 2012, Mexico adopted a fleet average target for CO, per kilometer. The annual target is based on the footprint of
each vehicle and since 2012 the stringency of the annual target has increased annually and will do so until 2025, when it will
reach 85-116.7 grams of CO) per kilometer. The Mexican government has also made available CO) credits for the use of
efficient technologies, including electric vehicles, off-cycle technologies and efficient air conditioning systems.

Enlarged Europe Region

Each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific registrations-weighted fleet average target for CO, emissions.
This regulation sets an industry fleet average target of 95 grams of CO; per kilometer starting in 2020 for passenger cars
(130g/km until 2019). In order to promote the sale of ultra-efficient vehicles, automobile manufacturers that have registered
vehicles emitting less than 50 grams of CO) per kilometer earned additional CO, credits from 2020 to 2022. Furthermore,
automobile manufacturers that make use of innovative technologies, or eco-innovations, which improve real-world fuel
economy but may not show results in the test cycles, such as solar panels or LED lighting, may gain an average credit for the
manufacturer's fleet of up to seven grams of CO, per kilometer.

The EU has also adopted standards for regulating CO, emissions from LCVs. This regulation set an industry fleet
average target of 147 grams of CO, per kilometer for LCVs.

In April 2019, the Regulation (EU) 2019/631 which sets new CO, emissions targets starting from 2025 and 2030
was adopted and requires a 15 percent reduction from 2021 levels in 2025 (both passenger cars and LCV), a 37.5 percent
reduction for passenger cars and a 31 percent reduction for LCV in 2030 from 2021 levels.

WLTP entered into force in September 2018 for all registered passenger cars and in September 2019 for all
registered LCVs. WLTP is intended to provide CO) emissions and fuel consumption values that are more representative of
real driving conditions.


--- Page 45 ---

The quantity of CO, emissions in 2023 will be affected not only by market evolution (such as the expected reduction
of diesel market share), but also by the continued commercialization of low-emission and electrified vehicles.

Other countries in Enlarged Europe region outside of the EU perimeter, such as Switzerland, have introduced
specific regulations aimed to reduce vehicle CO, emissions or fuel consumption. The United Kingdom is continuing to follow
the EU GHG policy for cars and LCVs post-Brexit, but changes are currently under discussion that might diverge from that
regulation in the future.

South America Region

In December 2018, the first regulations related to the Rota 2030 Program were enacted in Brazil. Rota 2030 is a
long-term program (three cycles of five years each) that replaced the Inovar Auto Program and establishes mandatory
requirements for vehicle commercialization in Brazil: (a) adhesion to Vehicle Labeling Program; (b) commitment to achieve
a minimum level of energy efficiency; and (c) commitment to achieve a minimum level of structural performance and driver
assistance technologies. The regulation for the next phase of Energy Efficiency (CO, /fuel efficiency) beginning in 2022
incorporates three fleets split into passenger, large SUV and light commercial vehicle categories. Among other things, the
rule rewards the improvement of sugar cane ethanol combustion efficiency and also recognizes and provides credit
flexibilities for technologies that provide benefits in conditions that are not seen on the standardized government test cycles.

In Argentina, although there is no current mandatory greenhouse gas requirement, the government is in the process
of implementing a comparative labeling based on the European statements (NEDC cycle) and legal text was published at the
end of 2021 and implemented in 2022.

In Chile, a federal law was published to establish an energy efficiency program. The technical rules and targets were
defined in February 2022 and must target implementation in February 2024 for light vehicles.

China Region

Beginning in 2021, China adopted WLTP for conventional and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (“PHEVs”) and a
unique Chinese test cycle is applied to battery electric vehicles in the same year. The 2021-2025 Phase V Corporate Average
Fuel Consumption (“CAFC”) rules were released in 2019 by the Chinese government with increasing stringency reaching a
target of 4.6 liters per 100 kilometers by 2025. The dual credit management rule for 2021-2023 was released in 2020, and the
2024-2025 CAFC and New Energy Vehicle (“NEV”) Credits are expected to be issued at a later date.

NEVs consist of PHEVs, BEVs, and fuel cell vehicles, which generate positive NEV credits, improve CAFC
performance and provide a volume multiplier in the CAFC calculation, subject to meeting certain criteria. Currently, off-
cycle credit flexibilities in China are available in the areas of high efficiency air conditioning and regenerative braking
technologies, subject to meeting certain standards.

In June 2020, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released administrative rules regarding
CAFC and NEV credits that became effective in January 2021. Non-compliance with the CAFC target in these administrative
tules can be offset through carry-forward CAFC credits, transfer of CAFC credits within affiliates, the OEMs use of its own
NEV credits, or the purchase of NEV credits. Non-compliance with the NEV target can only be offset by the purchase of
NEV credits. The homologation of new products that exceed CAFC targets will be suspended for OEMs that are unable to
offset CAFC and/or NEV deficits until the deficits are offset.

India & Asia Pacific Region
Certain markets within the India & Asia Pacific region have enacted fuel consumption and GHG targets. For

example, India began enforcing phase I CAFC targets (CO, ~130gm/km @ 1037 kg) starting in April 2017 with more
stringent phase II CAFC targets (CO, ~113gm/km @ 1082 kg) beginning in April 2022.


--- Page 46 ---

South Korea implemented a phase II of CAFE/CO) standards beginning in 2016. Phase III, with more stringent
targets, became effective in January 2021. Japan implemented a new fuel economy standard in 2020 that switched from
vehicle weight class average to corporate average fuel economy. In Australia, although there is no mandatory GHG standard,
the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries member companies implemented a voluntary CO, target for light vehicles
starting in 2020. A new regulatory framework for CAFE/CO, standards is expected to be published in 2023 and to be equally
or more stringent than EU new car CO, standards.

Management of end-of-life products

In European markets, pursuant to the EU End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (2000/53/EC) (the “EU ELV Directive”), all
vehicle manufacturers are required to set up a take-back network with professional dismantling partners to collect the
vehicles from their last owners or holders when such vehicles have reached the end of their lives, and recycle them to achieve
a minimum recycling and recovery rate of 95 percent of the average weight vehicle. The EU is reviewing the EU ELV
Directive for application beginning in 2024 to integrate the principles of eco-design and the obligations of recycled materials
in new vehicles into the December 2015 circular economy directive by the European Commission. The EU has also initiated
the revision of the European directive on batteries with a particular focus on automotive traction batteries.

In December 2022, France published a new ELV decree that aims to reduce illegal activity, take charge of
abandoned ELVs, and offer a free service for collection of ELVs from the last owners residing in the French territories,
including overseas. The Decree imposes the establishment either of an “Eco-Organism” (a collective non-profit system) on
behalf of OEMs or a “Particular System” by each OEM to directly assume the collection and processing of all its ELVs. The
OEMs have opted for implementation of the Particular System.

Vehicle Safety
North America Region

Under U.S. federal law, all vehicles sold in the U.S. must comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
(“FMVSS”) promulgated by NHTSA, and must be certified by their manufacturer as being in compliance with all such
standards at the time of the first purchase of the vehicle. In addition, if a vehicle contains a defect that is related to motor
vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable FMVSS, the manufacturer must notify NHTSA and vehicle owners and
provide a remedy at no cost. Moreover, the TREAD Act authorized NHTSA to promulgate regulations requiring Early
Warning Reporting (“EWR”). EWR requires manufacturers to provide NHTSA several categories of information, including
all claims which involve one or more fatalities or injuries; all incidents of which the manufacturer receives actual notice
which involve fatalities or injuries alleged or proven to have been caused by a possible defect in such manufacturer’s motor
vehicle or motor vehicle equipment in the U.S.; and all claims involving one or more fatalities in a foreign country when the
possible defect is in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment that is identical or substantially similar to a motor vehicle or
motor vehicle equipment offered for sale in the U.S., as well as aggregate data on property damage claims from alleged
defects in a motor vehicle or in motor vehicle equipment; warranty claims; consumer complaints and field reports about
alleged or possible defects. The rules also require reporting of customer satisfaction campaigns, consumer advisories, recalls,
or other activity involving the repair or replacement of motor vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment, even if not safety
related.

NHTSA has secured a voluntary commitment from manufacturers to equip future vehicles with automatic emergency
braking (“AEB") systems. The commitment made these braking systems standard on virtually all light-duty cars and trucks
with a gross vehicle weight of 8,500 pounds or less beginning September 1, 2022 and these systems will become standard on
virtually all trucks with a gross vehicle weight between 8,501 pounds and 10,000 pounds beginning no later than September
1, 2025. In 2023, NHTSA is expected to propose a rule regarding the requirement and standardization of AEB systems.

In September 2019, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Inc. and the Association of Global Automakers, Inc.,
which have combined to form the Alliance for Automobile Innovation, announced a voluntary commitment from auto
manufacturers to introduce technology including a combination of auditory and visual alerts to remind parents and caregivers
to check the back seat upon leaving a vehicle to help address the risk of pediatric heatstroke in children left in cars. The
commitment is to install such technology in essentially all new cars and trucks by the 2025 model year or sooner.


--- Page 47 ---

At times, organizations like NHTSA or the U.S. Insurance Institute of Highway Safety issue or reissue safety ratings
applicable to vehicles. In October 2019, NHTSA announced a plan to propose significant updates and upgrades to its New
Car Assessment Program, also known as the Five-star Safety Ratings Program. The details are not known at this time, but are
expected to include new test dummies, changes to the mandatory label, new test procedures and evaluation of new
technologies. Depending on the content of the final changes, this set of changes could impact the market competitiveness of
the affected vehicles.

NHTSA has also issued and updated non-binding guidelines for addressing cybersecurity issues in the design and
manufacture of new motor vehicles, as well as guidance for the investigation and validation of cybersecurity measures.

In November 2020, voters in the State of Massachusetts passed a ballot initiative appearing to conflict with NHTSA
cybersecurity guidelines and may require manufacturers to disable or compromise some of the cybersecurity measures they
have put in place. The complete effects of this new law are still under review. In the meantime, the Alliance for Automation
Innovation, an industry association to which Stellantis belongs, has filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin enforcement of the new
law and the litigation is pending.

A new FMVSS requiring artificial sound in electric and hybrid electric vehicles took effect for new motor vehicles
built on or after March 1, 2021. The artificial sound is intended to provide persons with impaired vision an audible notice of
the presence of a BEV or hybrid electric vehicle.

In January 2018, Mexico issued an amendment to the Consumers' Protection Law (“CPL”) regarding safety
regulations based on U.S. standards. The CPL, among other things, includes a deadline for vehicle manufacturers to provide
to the Federal Consumer Protection Agency (i) the launch date and a detailed description of every safety campaign applicable
to vehicles sold in Mexico, (ii) mandatory recall campaigns, based on international agencies' investigations and guidelines,
(iii) mandatory repurchase, repair or replacement (with a new vehicle model having the same characteristics) of vehicles that
risk the consumer's safety, health or life or threatens the consumer's personal financial condition, and (iv) mandatory product
withdrawal, when the Federal Consumer Protection Agency determines that the vehicle could risk the consumer's safety,
health or life or affect the consumer's personal financial condition. The consumer may also be eligible for compensation
related to a recall. The rules of the CPL became effective in December 2019.

Enlarged Europe

Vehicles sold in Europe are subject to vehicle safety regulations established by the EU or, in very limited cases and
aspects, by individual Member States. In 2009, the EU established a uniform legal framework for vehicle safety, repealing
more than 50 then-existing directives and replacing them with a single regulation known as the “General Safety Regulation”
aimed at incorporating relevant United Nations standards. The incorporation of United Nations standards commenced in
2012, leading adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/2144, repealing various previous European regulations (the “New GSR”).
Implementation of the New GSR for new vehicles and vehicle types started in 2022. The New GSR will lead, through
deadlines scheduled in 2024, 2026 and 2029, to the gradual implementation of a variable suite of passive and active safety
technologies, depending on vehicle type and classification. The significant items for the most common vehicles include, other
than the manufacturer’s certification for the cybersecurity features and related application on vehicles, mandatory features
such as advanced emergency braking, intelligent speed assistance, emergency lane keeping, driver drowsiness and attention
warning, advanced driver distraction warning, reversing detection, event data recorder, protection of pedestrians (including an
extension of the pedestrian head protection area), cyclists and other vulnerable road users, and an expanded scope and
addition of new test modes for front and side crash testing. Also included in the New GSR are the approvals of autonomous
vehicle features, such as a driver availability monitoring system, automated lane keeping systems, systems to replace driver’s
control and vehicle platooning.

The most recent development for homologation purposes concerning automated driving is Regulation EU 2022/1426
in August 2022, defining standards to be complied with by level 4 automated driving systems (driverless vehicles, e.g.,
shuttles, valet parking, robot taxi, where no driver expected). UN Regulation on “highway chauffeur”, setting new technical
regulation on level 3 automated driving (hands off the steering wheel), will be included beginning in January 2023, in
addition to “Traffic jam chauffeur”. The UN Regulation on Software Updates for already registered vehicles is also expected
to be introduced in Europe and will require manufacturers to trace the link between each software update and the vehicle type
approval and define the requirements for securing software updates. In addition, in-vehicle emergency call systems became
mandatory for new type-approved vehicles in the EU, Israel and Turkey markets in 2018. In Russia, a similar in-vehicle
emergency call system became mandatory in 2015.


--- Page 48 ---

Effective in September 2020, Regulation (EU) 2018/858 improved the current legal framework for EU type-approval
and introduced new provisions on market surveillance. This new regime on market surveillance specifies the obligations of
the economic operators in the automotive supply chain (manufacturers, manufacturer’s representatives, importers and
distributors), the responsibilities of the enforcement authorities in the Member States, and the measures to be taken when
vehicles and related components on the market appear to be affected by non-conformities to type approval and/or serious
safety or environmental risks.

South America Region

Vehicles sold in the South America region are subject to different vehicle safety regulations according to each
country, generally based on European and United Nations standards. Brazil published a draft of its 10-year safety regulatory
roadmap in 2017, providing a staged approach to implementation of new testing requirements and active safety technology.
More costly active safety technologies will be scheduled for implementation after 2024. In July 2018, the first regulation
related to Rota 2030 was enacted. Rota 2030 is a long-term program (three cycles of five years each) which includes
principles related to mandatory safety for all vehicles sold in Brazil. These regulations were approved by the Brazilian
Congress and sanctioned by the Brazilian President in December 2018 as well as ordinary regulations to address certain
minimum requirements and other metrics.

China and India & Asia Pacific Regions

China, India and many countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, Japan and South Korea have adopted
their own new car assessment program and vehicle safety regulations. As UN ECE1958 agreement countries, Australia, Japan
and South Korea accept UN ECE safety requirements and are harmonizing their regulations with UN ECE. The U.S.-Korea
Free Trade Agreement allows for the sale in Korea of U.S. vehicles that are manufactured in the U.S.

Most of the Chinese vehicle safety regulations are equivalent to UN ECE, but China has unique electric vehicle
safety regulations and has developed a roadmap of autonomous driving and connectivity regulations. China published the
Regulation for Administration of Recall of Defective Vehicles effective in 2013 and the Implementation Provisions on the
Regulation for Administration of Recall of Defective Vehicles effective in 2016. In 2019, State Administration for Market
Regulation in China issued a notice requiring close supervision of defects reporting and recall of new energy vehicles. China
issued rules on emission recalls effective in July 2021. Further, beginning in early 2021, various authorities have issued
administrative rules on cybersecurity and the software update of vehicles.

India has implemented vehicle crash regulations effective in 2019 for all models and pedestrian protection regulations
effective in 2020 for all models. Provision of important safety features such as airbag on driver side, vehicle rear parking alert
system, safety belt reminder for driver and passenger side, speed alert system and manual override for door latches have been
mandatory for all models beginning in June 2019. Further, fitment of airbag on passenger side was made mandatory effective
December 2021. Rules for vehicle recalls were also implemented, effective April 2021, and brake and electronic stability
control system regulations will be aligned to EU regulations, beginning in 2022 for all models.

In Korea, the amended Motor Vehicle Management Act (““MVMA”), which changed the overall recall procedures for
automobiles, while also imposing heightened obligations on vehicle manufacturers, took effect in February 2021. The
amended MVMA increased the upper limit of administrative surcharges imposed for delayed recalls, to an amount three
times higher than the previous cap. In addition, under the amended MVMA, if a delayed recall causes harm to a person’s life,
body or property, such person may file a claim for damages, including punitive damages of up to five times the amount of
actual damages. Under the amended MVMA, vehicle manufacturers are also subject to increased administrative and criminal
sanctions.

Industrial Environmental Control

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air
emissions, water discharges, waste management and related environmental effects, and environmental clean-up if waste
disposal was done outside of legal requirements. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund
remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal, or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain
circumstances, these laws impose liability for related damages to natural resources.


--- Page 49 ---

To best comply with these requirements, Stellantis imposes a self-governing environmental management system
(“EMS”) on its operations, which are designed to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of our manufacturing activities,
and conduct internal environmental audits at our facilities. This program formalizes our commitment to responsible
environmental management of our manufacturing methods and processes. We have established a corporate requirement that
all of our manufacturing facilities become certified under the EMS requirements set forth in the ISO 14001 standard (ISO is
an international standard-setting organization). As of December 31, 2022, the majority of Stellantis manufacturing plants had
an ISO 14001 certified EMS in place.

Workplace Health and Safety

Stellantis implemented a self-governing occupational health and safety management system (“OHSMS”) on its
operations, which are designed to prevent or reduce the occupational injuries and incidents and conduct internal health and
safety audits at our facilities. The goal of achieving zero accidents was formalized by internally-established OHSMS
requirements. At December 31, 2022, 63 of Stellantis’ manufacturing plants were certified under the International
Organization of Standardization’s global 45001 standard.

Applicability of Banking Law and Regulation to Financial Services
Several of our finance companies are regulated as financial institutions in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

In Italy, FCA Bank S.p.A., an equity method joint venture, is subject to European Central Bank (“ECB”) and Bank
of Italy supervision. Within FCA Bank Group, FCA Bank G.m.b.H., an Austrian subsidiary, is subject to the supervision of
the ECB and of local central banks. Certain other Stellantis subsidiaries are subject to the supervision of the local supervisory
financial or banking authority: Banco Fidis S.A. is subject to Brazilian Central Bank supervision, FCA Compajiia Financiera
S.A., incorporated in Argentina, is subject to Argentinian Central Bank supervision and FCA Automotive Finance Co., Ltd, is
subject to the supervision of the Chinese Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and People’s Bank of China.

In France, Banque PSA Finance S.A., a wholly owned consolidated entity, is subject to the supervision of the French
local supervisory banking authority (ACPR), and Compagnie pour la Location de Véhicules S.A.(CLV), Crédipar, PSA
Banque France S.A. and Opel Bank S.A. are subject to the supervision of ECB and the ACPR. In Germany, PSA Bank
Deutschland GmbH is subject to the supervision of the ECB and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). In
Italy, Banca PSA Italia S.p.A. is subject to ECB and Bank of Italy supervision. In Spain, PSA Financial Services Spain EFC
SA is subject to the supervision of the Bank of Spain. Banco PSA Finance Brasil S.A. is subject to Brazilian Central Bank
supervision. Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Financial Leasing is subject to the supervision of the Chinese Banking and Insurance
Regulatory Commission and People’s Bank of China. With the exception of Banque PSA Finance S.A, all of the above
entities are joint ventures accounted by equity method.

In the U.S., Stellantis Financial Services US Corp., a wholly owned consolidated entity, is a financial services
company which conducts sales finance and consumer lending activities in the U.S. market under the supervision of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and various state regulatory agencies.

As a result of the regulation described above, these companies are, in certain circumstances, subject to requirements
in a wide range of areas including solvency, capital, reporting, customer protection and account administration, among other
matters.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the
information included under “STELLANTIS OVERVIEW” and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties relating to
Stellantis, including, but not limited to, those described under ‘Cautionary Statements Concerning Forward Looking
Statements” and “Risk Factors”. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking
statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 2020 on an IFRS and on a Pro Forma basis was previously included in the section
“FINANCIAL OVERVIEW” in the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021.

Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities
The trends, uncertainties and opportunities facing Stellantis are summarized below:

Impact of Unfilled Semiconductor Orders. Our operations have been, and continue to be, affected by a significant
semiconductor supply shortage as a result of unfilled orders that began in 2020, and increased chip delivery lead times, which
has resulted in reduced vehicle production volumes, and increased costs to source available semiconductors. To the extent
this unavailability of semiconductor chips as a result of unfilled orders continues or worsens, and we are unable to mitigate its
effects, our ability to deliver planned quantities of our vehicles will continue to be adversely affected.

Shipments and Sales. Vehicle shipments are generally driven by expectations of consumer demand for vehicles,
which is affected by economic conditions, availability and cost of dealer and customer financing and incentives offered to
retail customers, as discussed further below.

In our financial information presented in this report, we recognized revenue at the same time as the transfer of
control of goods sold. For new vehicles, this transfer generally corresponds to the date when the vehicles were made available
to independent dealers or, in the case of direct sales to end-customers through owned dealers, the delivery date of the vehicle
to end-customers.

Revenues from service contracts and connectivity services are generally recognized over the contract period in
proportion to the costs expected to be incurred based on the Company’s historical experience. These services are either
included in the selling price of the vehicle or separately priced. Revenue for services is allocated based on the estimated
stand-alone selling price. Costs associated with these services are deferred and are subsequently amortized to expense
consistent with how the related revenue is recognized.

Logistics Challenges. Our overall vehicle shipment volumes were negatively impacted in 2022 by the continuing
effects of logistics challenges in Europe. In particular, Europe is experiencing a continuing shortage of delivery drivers and
specialized equipment to transport finished vehicles from production facilities to retailers or other points of sale. As a result,
we experienced a significant increase in Company-owned inventory as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31,
2021. We expect that this trend may continue in 2023.

Financing. Given that a large percentage of the vehicles we sell to dealers and retail customers worldwide are
financed, the availability and cost of financing is a significant factor affecting our vehicle shipment volumes and Net
revenues. Availability of customer financing could affect the vehicle mix, as customers who have access to greater financing
are able to purchase higher priced vehicles, whereas when customer financing is constrained, vehicle mix could shift towards
less expensive vehicles. The low interest rate environment in recent years has had the effect of reducing the effective cost of
vehicle ownership. In response to the inflationary surge in Europe, in the United Kingdom, in the U.S. and elsewhere, central
banks have aggressively increased interest rates in 2022 and such increases are being reflected in rates across credit markets,
including consumer credit. More expensive vehicle financing may make our vehicles less affordable to retail consumers or
steer consumers to less expensive vehicles that would be less profitable for us.


--- Page 51 ---

Electrification. In March 2022, we announced our Dare Forward 2030 long-term strategy and confirmed our plans to
make significant investments in electrification and set aggressive targets for future low emission vehicle sales, including
global annual BEV sales of five million vehicles by 2030. Our ability to meet our targets and recoup our significant
anticipated investments will be subject to several factors, including BEV market demand, charging network deployment and
the availability of government incentives.

Product Development and Technology. A key driver of consumer demand, and therefore our performance, is the
continued refresh, renewal and evolution of our vehicle portfolio, and we have announced commitments of significant capital
and resources toward the introduction of new vehicle platforms and new software technologies. In order to realize a return on
the significant investments we intend to make, and to achieve competitive operating margins, we will have to continue
significant investment in new vehicle launches. We believe past efforts in developing common vehicle platforms and
propulsion systems have accelerated the time-to-market for many of our vehicle launches and over time resulted in cost
savings. We expect this positive trend to accelerate as a result of the merger and ongoing integration, as well as our
announced plans to converge on four vehicle platforms for future vehicle launches. However, achieving the benefits of
integration and particularly the convergence of platforms will require significant investments over the medium term.

The costs associated with product development, vehicle improvements and launches, impact our Net profit. In
addition, our ability to continue to make the necessary investments in product development, and recover the related costs,
depends in large part on the market acceptance and success of the new or significantly refreshed vehicles we introduce. New
launches are supported by marketing and profitability studies carried out several years prior to their actual launch, which
increases the risk of not meeting customer preferences, resulting in lower volumes than forecasted or selling at lower prices
and impacting profitability.

The research and development expenses presented in the financial information in this report include the cost of
scientific and technical activities, intellectual property rights, and the education and training necessary for the development,
production or implementation and marketing of new or substantially improved materials, methods, products, processes,
systems or services. Development expenditures were recognized as an intangible asset if we could demonstrate (i) our
intention to complete the intangible asset as well as the availability of technical, financial and other resources for this
purpose; (ii) that it was probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the development expenditure will flow to
the entity; and (iii) that the cost of the asset could be measured reliably. Capitalized development expenditures included
related borrowing costs.

Future developments in our product portfolio could lead to significant capitalization of development assets and
thereafter amortization of such assets. Our time to market is approximately 24 months, but varies depending on the specific
product, from the date the design is signed-off for tooling and production, after which the product goes into production,
resulting in an increase in amortization. Therefore, our operating results are impacted by the cyclicality of our research and
development expenditures based on our product plans and our ability to bring projects timely into production.

In order to meet expected changes in consumer demand and regulatory requirements, we intend to invest significant
resources in product development and research and development. New markets for alternative fuel source vehicles and
autonomous vehicles are also continuing to emerge and we expect both to invest resources in these areas and to optimize our
R&D investments as a result of the progressive integration of the former FCA and PSA businesses.

Vehicle Profitability. Our results of operations reflect the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which tends to vary
based upon a number of factors, including vehicle size and model, the content of those vehicles, brand positioning, and the
mix of internal-combustion, electric and hybrid engines. Vehicle profitability also depends on sales prices to dealers and fleet
customers, net of sales incentives, costs of materials and components, as well as transportation and warranty costs.

Our larger vehicles, such as UVs and pickup trucks, have historically been more profitable on a per vehicle basis
than smaller vehicles. In recent years, consumer preferences for certain larger vehicles, such as SUVs, have increased;
however, there is no guarantee this trend will continue.


--- Page 52 ---

Newly introduced internal-combustion models are generally more profitable than older models, and vehicles
equipped with additional options are generally more profitable than those with fewer options. As a result, our ability to offer
attractive vehicle options and upgrades is critical to our ability to increase our profitability on these vehicles. In addition, in
the U.S. and Europe, our vehicle sales to dealers for sale to their retail consumers are normally more profitable than our fleet
sales, in part because the retail consumers are more likely to prefer additional optional features while fleet customers
increasingly tend to concentrate purchases on smaller vehicles with fewer optional features, which have historically had a
lower profitability per unit.

Vehicles sold under certain brand and model names are generally more profitable when there is strong brand
recognition of those vehicles. In some cases this is tied to a long history of the brands and models, and in other cases to
customers identifying these vehicles as being more attractive and responsive to customer needs.

In addition, against a backdrop of significant technological development, changing consumer patterns and new
competitive forces, the cost of complying with tightening regulatory requirements could negatively impact our profitability.
Vehicle models that are equipped with BEV or PHEV propulsion systems tend to have lower margins than those equipped
with internal-combustion engines, with the significant costs of batteries largely accounting for this differential. Although
battery prices are expected to gradually decline in the coming years and are partially offset in some cases by governmental
subsidies and tax exemptions, we expect that in the near term the profitability of BEV or PHEV vehicles will continue to lag
behind those equipped with internal-combustion engines.

Pricing. The automotive industry has historically experienced intense price competition resulting from the variety of
available competitive vehicles and excess global manufacturing capacity. Manufacturers have typically promoted products by
offering dealer, retail and fleet incentives, including cash rebates, option package discounts, and subsidized financing or
leasing programs, leading to increased price pressure and sharpened competition within the industry. We plan to continue to
use such incentives, as needed, to price vehicles competitively and to manage demand and support inventory management
profitability.

Our ability to maintain or increase pricing has impacted, and will continue to impact, our results of operations and
profitability. In 2022, our ability to maintain strong pricing across all of the regions where we operate, particularly in North
America and Enlarged Europe, allowed us to offset significant inflationary, supply chain and logistics-related pressure.

Production costs. Production costs include purchases (including costs related to the purchase of components and raw
materials), labor costs, depreciation, amortization, logistic and product warranty and recall campaign costs. We purchase a
variety of components, raw materials, supplies, utilities, logistics and other services from numerous suppliers. Fluctuations in
production costs are primarily related to the number of vehicles we produce and sell along with shifts in vehicle mix, as
newer models of vehicles generally have more technologically advanced components and enhancements and therefore higher
costs per unit.

Production costs may also be affected by fluctuations in raw material prices. For example, some of the batteries
contained in our electric and hybrid models include rare raw materials, which are exposed to heightened shortage risks and
potentially rising procurement costs. The cost of raw materials has historically comprised approximately 15-20 percent of our
total purchases described above, while the remaining 80-85 percent of our total purchases is made of components, conversion
of raw materials and overhead costs. In 2021, we experienced an increase in the cost of raw materials of approximately €2.2
billion and in 2022 we experienced a further increase of €6.7 billion. To the extent the cost of raw materials continues to
increase as a result of inflationary pressures, and we are unable to mitigate its effects, our future profitability could be
impacted.

We typically seek to manage production costs and minimize their volatility by using fixed price purchase contracts,
commercial negotiations and technical efficiencies.


--- Page 53 ---

Despite our efforts, our production costs related to raw materials and components have increased as a result of tariffs
introduced in recent years; uncertainty related to tariffs and trade policy in our larger markets including the U.S., the
European Union and China has made it more difficult to predict our raw material and components costs. Our production costs
have also increased as we have significantly enhanced the content of our vehicles as we renew and refresh our product
offerings. Over time, technological advancements and improved material sourcing may reduce the cost to us of the additional
enhancements. In addition, we seek to recover higher costs through pricing actions, but even when market conditions permit
this, there may be a time lag between the increase in our costs and our ability to realize improved pricing. Accordingly, our
results are typically adversely affected, at least in the short term, until price increases are accepted in the market.

Further, in many markets where our vehicles are sold, we are required to pay import duties on those vehicles, which
are included in production costs. We reflect these costs in the price charged to our customers to the extent market conditions
permit. However, for many of our vehicles, particularly in the mass-market vehicle segments, we cannot always pass along
increases in those duties to our dealers and distributors and remain competitive. Our ability to price our vehicles to recover
those increased costs has affected, and will continue to affect, our profitability.

Economic Conditions. Demand for new vehicles tends to reflect economic conditions in the various markets in
which we operate because retail sales depend on individual purchasing decisions, which in turn are affected by many factors
including inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence, and levels of disposable income. Fleet sales and sales of light
commercial vehicles are also influenced by economic conditions, which drive vehicle utilization and investment activity.
Further, demand for light commercial vehicles and pickup trucks is driven, in part, by construction and infrastructure
projects. Therefore, our performance is directly correlated with the macroeconomic trends in the markets in which we
operate.

Several of the markets in which we operate are entering a challenging macroeconomic climate with recessions
probable in the near term. Fuel prices, in addition, have been highly volatile following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and
volatility and price increases may continue. Consumers are facing challenging cost inflation, negative real wages and higher
borrowing rates, which may translate into lower sales, particularly in the more profitable segments of our product mix.

Russia & Ukraine War. In response to the on-going Russia-Ukraine war, various governments around the world
have applied economic, trade and financial sanctions against Russia.

In Russia, we have a joint venture assembly plant, accounted for as a joint operation, as well as national sales
companies. In March 2022, the import and export of vehicles to and from Russia were suspended by Stellantis. In April 2022,
operations at the joint venture assembly plant were suspended. In Ukraine, we have a national sales company.

Due to the sustained Russia-Ukraine conflict, the continued economic, trade and financial sanctions imposed by
various governments around the world and continued uncertainty related to the future of our operations in Russia, we have
recognized an impairment of our assets in Russia for €137 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022. The
impairment charges are comprised of €43 million related to inventories, €47 million related to tax assets and €47 million
related to other assets.

Regulation. We are subject to a complex set of regulatory regimes throughout the world in which vehicle safety,
emissions and fuel economy regulations have become increasingly stringent and the related enforcement regimes increasingly
active. These developments may affect our vehicle sales as well as our profitability and reputation. We are subject to
applicable national and local regulations with which we must comply in order to continue operations in every market,
including a number of markets in which we derive substantial revenue. Developing, engineering and manufacturing vehicles
that meet these requirements and therefore may be sold in those markets requires a significant expenditure of management
time and financial resources.

We expect that our plans to converge on four platforms for future vehicle launches will allow us to deploy
electrification technologies and CO, abating technologies across our range of brands and react quickly to changes in
regulation. However, these costs and the costs incurred to meet other regulatory requirements may be difficult to pass through
to customers, so the increased costs may affect our results of operations and profitability.


--- Page 54 ---

In addition, regulatory requirements in relation to GHG emissions from vehicles are increasingly stringent. For
example, on March 9, 2022, the EPA reinstated California’s authority under the Clean Air Act to enforce its own, more
stringent, GHG emission standards for passenger vehicles and light duty trucks (the “California Waiver’). California
emission standards covered by the California Waiver may be adopted by other states and to date 17 other states and the
District of Columbia (the “California Waiver States”) have adopted California’s GHG emissions standards under the
California Waiver.

Prior to the EPA’s withdrawal of the California Waiver, automotive OEMs were deemed to be compliant with
California’s GHG emissions standards if they were compliant with the EPA’s GHG standards. This “deemed to comply”
mechanism was removed from the California regulation prior to the reinstatement of the California Waiver. As interpreted by
CARB, the EPA’s reinstatement of the California Waiver together with the removal of the “deemed to comply” mechanism
means that automotive OEMs are retroactively subject to the separate California GHG standards beginning with the model
year 2021 fleet. OEMs may achieve compliance with the California GHG emission standards in several ways, including
through the sale of emission-compliant vehicles within their fleet for a given model year, through the carryforward or
carryback of excess credits generated by a compliant fleet in past or future years, by the purchase of California-specific
regulatory credits from third parties or by a combination of the foregoing.

Wedid not meet the California GHG targets for model year 2021 and do not expect to meet the California GHG
targets for model year 2022, as in planning both model years prior to reinstatement of the California Waiver we assumed the
ability to utilize existing credits based on regulations in force at the time. We intend to be compliant with the California GHG
program, and for those years and any other model year with deficits, we intend to seek to cover such deficits with excess
credits generated through our compliance in model years within the applicable five-year carryback period.

We are executing on several important steps to support our carryback strategy, including the allocation of significant
capital to the development of electrified platforms for North American vehicles and the planned electrification of the Ram
portfolio as well as agreements to secure battery production and related raw materials. Additionally, we expect to launch
thirteen battery electric vehicles in the U.S. between 2023 and 2025. For more information regarding our electrification
activities, refer to “STELLANTIS OVERVIEW- Overview of Our Business - Research and Development”. The success of our
carryback strategy depends on future levels and mix of production and sales, as well as general market demand for battery
electric vehicles, all of which are inherently speculative. Moreover, the financial impact of our efforts to change the mix of
vehicles we sell in California and the California Waiver States as we seek to comply are unclear but may be significant, and
may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in future years.

We understand that certain other automobile OEMs are subject to less stringent California GHG emissions standards
pursuant to settlement agreements entered into with CARB on terms that are not available us. We are currently evaluating the
enforceability of the California GHG emissions standards as applied by CARB, particularly in light of their retroactive
application following the EPA’s reinstatement of the California Waiver, as well as the disparate treatment of other
automotive OEMs which are not subject to the same standards. If we were to challenge the retroactive or disparate application
of the California GHG emissions standards, the direct and indirect costs of such challenge may be significant and there can be
no assurance that it would be successful.

Effects of Foreign Exchange Rates. We are affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (i) through translation
of foreign currency financial statements into Euro for consolidation, which we refer to as the translation impact, and (ii)
through transactions by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their own functional currencies, which we refer to as the
transaction impact. Given our presence in numerous countries outside the Eurozone, a strengthening of foreign currencies (in
particular of the U.S. Dollar, given the size of our U.S. operations) against the Euro generally would have a positive effect on
our financial results, which are reported in Euro, and on our operations in relation to sales in those countries of vehicles and
components produced in Europe. Our 2022 results benefited from the strength of the U.S. Dollar, which has traded at
historically high levels against the Euro. Additionally, a significant portion of our operating cash flow is expected to be
generated in U.S. Dollars and, although a portion of our debt is denominated in U.S. Dollars, the majority of our indebtedness
is denominated in Euro. Given the mix of our debt and liquidity, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro generally
has provided a positive impact on our net cash position. The recent strength of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro may reverse
in future periods, which could have a correspondingly negative impact on our financial results and net cash position.

In order to reduce the impacts of foreign exchange rates, we historically hedged a percentage of certain exposures.
Refer to Note 31, Qualitative and quantitative information on financial risks within the Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

Shipment Information

As discussed in STELLANTIS OVERVIEW—Overview of Our Business, our activities were carried out through six
reportable segments: five regional reportable vehicle segments North America, Enlarged Europe, Middle East & Africa,
South America and China and India & Asia Pacific and the Maserati global luxury brand segment. The following table sets
forth vehicle shipment information by segment. Vehicle shipments are generally aligned with current period production
which is driven by plans to meet consumer demand. Revenue is recognized when control of our vehicles, services or parts has
been transferred and the Company’s performance obligations to customers has been satisfied. The Company has determined
that our customers from the sale of vehicles and service parts are generally dealers, distributors, fleet customers or directly to
retail customers. Transfer of control, and therefore revenue recognition, generally correspond to the date when the vehicles or
service parts were made available to the customer, or when the vehicles or service parts were released to the carrier
responsible for transporting them to the customer. New vehicle sales with guaranteed residual value guarantees provided by
the Company are recognized as revenue when control of the vehicle transferred to the customer, except in situations where
the Company issued a put option for which there is a significant economic incentive to exercise. The Company also sold
vehicles where, the contract included a put option whereby the customer could require the Company to repurchase the
vehicles. For these types of arrangements, the Company assessed whether a significant economic incentive did not exist for
the customer to exercise its put option, then revenue was recognized when control of the vehicle transferred to the fleet
customer. Refer to Note 2, Basis of preparation, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report for further details on our revenue recognition policy.

For a description of our dealers and distributors see STELLANTIS OVERVIEW—Sales Overview. Accordingly, the

number of vehicles sold does not necessarily correspond to the number of vehicles shipped for which revenues were recorded
in any given period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We monitor our operations through the use of several non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”)
financial measures: Adjusted operating income, Industrial free cash flows and Industrial net financial position. We believe
that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding our operating results and enhance
the overall ability to assess our financial performance. They provide us with comparable measures which facilitate
management’s ability to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations
and other operational decisions. These and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which we operate, however,
these financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not intended to
be substitutes for measures of financial performance as prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, as well as
IFRS as adopted by the European Union.

Adjusted operating income: Adjusted operating income/(loss) excludes from Net profit/(loss) from continuing
operations adjustments comprising restructuring, impairments, asset write-offs, disposals of investments and unusual
operating income/(expense) that are considered rare or discrete events and are infrequent in nature, as inclusion of such items
is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance, and also excludes Net financial
expenses/(income), Tax expense/(benefit) and Share of the profit/(loss) of equity method investees.

Unusual operating income/(expense) are impacts from strategic decisions as well as events considered rare or
discrete and infrequent in nature, as inclusion of such items is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing
operating performance. Unusual operating income/(expense) includes, but may not be limited to:

+ Impacts from strategic decisions to rationalize Stellantis’ core operations;

+  Facility-related costs stemming from Stellantis’ plans to match production capacity and cost structure to market
demand; and

+ Convergence and integration costs directly related to significant acquisitions or mergers.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, Pro Forma Adjusted operating income includes the Adjusted operating
income of FCA for the period January | - January 16, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Pro Forma Adjusted
operating income includes the Adjusted operating income result of FCA for the period January 1 - December 31, 2020.

Adjusted operating income is used for internal reporting to assess performance and as part of the Company's
forecasting, budgeting and decision making processes as it provides additional transparency to the Company's core
operations. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful because it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of
the Company’s ongoing operating performance and allows management to view operating trends, perform analytical
comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among our segments. We also believe that Adjusted operating
income is useful for analysts and investors to understand how management assesses the Company’s ongoing operating
performance on a consistent basis. In addition, Adjusted operating income is one of the metrics used in the determination of
the annual performance bonus for the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and other eligible employees, including
members of the Top Executive Team.

Refer to the sections Company Results and Results by Segment below for further discussion and for a reconciliation
of this non-GAAP measure to Net profit from continuing operations, which is the most directly comparable measure included
in our Consolidated Income Statement. Adjusted operating income should not be considered as a substitute for Net profit
from continuing operations, cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under IFRS.

Industrial free cash flows: is our key cash flow metric and is calculated as Cash flows from operating activities less:
cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations; cash flows from operating activities related to financial
services, net of eliminations; investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities,
contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other
investments; and adjusted for: net intercompany payments between continuing operations and discontinued operations,
proceeds from disposal of assets and contributions to defined benefit pension plans, net of tax. For the year ended December
31, 2021, Pro Forma Industrial free cash flows include the Industrial free cash flows of FCA for the period January | -
January 16, 2021. The timing of Industrial free cash flows may be affected by the timing of monetization of receivables and
the payment of accounts payables, as well as changes in other components of working capital, which can vary from period to
period due to, among other things, cash management initiatives and other factors, some of which may be outside of the
Company’s control. In addition, Industrial free cash flows is one of the metrics used in the determination of the annual
performance bonus for the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and other eligible employees, including members of the
Top Executive Team.

Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources —Industrial free cash flows for further information and the reconciliation
of this non-GAAP measure to Cash flows from operating activities, which is the most directly comparable measure included
in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Industrial free cash flows should not be considered as a substitute for Net
profit from continuing operations, cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under IFRS.

Industrial net financial position is calculated as: Debt plus derivative financial liabilities related to industrial
activities less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial securities that are considered liquid, (iii) current financial
receivables from the Company or its jointly controlled financial services entities and (iv) derivative financial assets and
collateral deposits. Therefore, debt, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets/liabilities pertaining to Stellantis’
financial services entities are excluded from the computation of the Industrial net financial position. Industrial net financial
position includes the Industrial net financial position classified as held for sale. We believe Industrial net financial position is
useful in providing a measure of the Company’s net cash, considering cash and cash equivalents and financial securities. Due
to different sources of cash flows used for the repayment of the financial debt between industrial activities and financial
services (by cash from operations for industrial activities and by collection of financial receivables for financial services) and
the different business structure and leverage implications, we provide a separate analysis of Net financial position between
industrial activities and financial services. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources —Industrial net financial position for
further information.

2022 2021 2022 vs.2021 (€ million) 2021 Forma 2021
€ 144,327 € 119,943 20.3 % Cost of revenues € 122,207 18.1 %
80.4 % 80.3% Cost of revenues as % of Net revenues 80.3 %

Cost of revenues includes purchases (including commodity and components costs), labor costs, depreciation,
amortization, logistics cost, product warranty and recall campaign costs.

The increase in Cost of revenues in 2022 on an IFRS basis compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma 2021 was primarily
related to synergies for purchasing, manufacturing and supply chain activities more than offset by: (i) higher raw material
costs (ii) product line mix in North America and South America (iii) higher volumes in North America (iv) higher energy and
logistics costs (v) foreign currency translation differences mainly due to the fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar and Brazilian Real
against the Euro and (vi) amounts that have been excluded from Adjusted operating income primarily related to an increase
of €660 million in the provision related to Model Year 2019 - 2021 U.S. CAFE penalty rate adjustment and €951 million for
extension of the Takata airbags recall campaign in Enlarged Europe, North America, Middle East & Africa and South
America.

The decrease in Selling, general and other costs in 2022 on an IFRS basis compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma
2021 was primarily related to synergies and cost containment actions partially offset by foreign currency translation
differences.

The increase in Research and development expenditures expensed in 2022 on an IFRS basis compared to the IFRS
and Pro Forma 2021 was primarily related to increased early vehicle development spending as well as foreign currency
translation.

The increase in Amortization of capitalized development expenditures in 2022 on an IFRS basis compared to the
IFRS and Pro Forma 2021 was primarily related to the launch of the all-new Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer and all-new Jeep
Grand Cherokee during 2021 and foreign currency translation.

The following table summarizes total Research and development expenditures for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021 and total Pro Forma research and development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021:

ended December 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis, in accordance with IAS 23 - Borrowing costs (Revised)

The Company conducts research and development for new vehicles and technology to improve the performance,
safety, fuel efficiency, reliability, consumer perception and environmental impact of its vehicles. Research and development
costs consist primarily of material costs, services and personnel related expenses that support the development of new and
existing vehicles with propulsion systems technologies. For further details of research and development costs, see Trends,
Uncertainties and Opportunities—Product Development and Technology and Overview of Our Business - Research and
Development.

The increase in total Research and development expenditures in 2022 on an IFRS basis compared to the IFRS and
Pro Forma 2021 was primarily related to increased early vehicle development spending as well as increased spending on

development of electrified vehicles and foreign currency exchange rates.

The increase in Net financial expenses in 2022 on an IFRS basis compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma 2021
primarily reflects the cost of hedging and currency depreciation in Argentina, the application of hyperinflationary accounting
for entities whose functional currency is the Turkish Lira, the increased interest expense on notes and the lower amount of
borrowing costs capitalized, partially offset by the increased return on cash investments.

The effective tax rate was 14.2 percent and 13.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021,
respectively. The increase of 90 bps was primarily related to a lower tax benefit for net recognition of Deferred tax assets,
primarily in Enlarged Europe.

The decrease in Share of the profit of equity method investees in 2022 on an IFRS basis compared to the IFRS and
Pro Forma 2021 was primarily related to the impairment related to GAC-Stellantis JV for an amount of €297 million and an
estimated loss of €133 million from the planned sale of FCA Bank to CACF in 2023. Refer to Note 3, Scope of consolidation
within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

The increase in Net profit from continuing operations in 2022 on an IFRS basis compared to the IFRS and Pro
Forma 2021 was primarily related to higher operating performance particularly in North America, South America and
Enlarged Europe which is partially offset by higher restructuring expenses and lower share of profit of equity method
investees.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, Profit/(loss) from discontinued operations related to the results of Faurecia.
Following the loss of control of Faurecia at the beginning of January 2021, a gain of €990 million has been recognized
consisting of a gain of €515 million upon the classification of the investment in Faurecia as a financial asset and the
subsequent remeasurement at fair value through profit and loss of €475 million. Refer to Note 3, Scope of consolidation,

The increase in North America shipments on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma basis for
the corresponding period in 2021 was mainly due to higher volumes of all-new Grand Wagoneer, Jeep Compass and Chrysler

Pacifica, partially offset by lower volumes of Grand Cherokee and Ram pickups.

Net revenues

The increase in North America Net revenues on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma basis
for the corresponding period in 2021 was primarily due to strong net pricing, favorable vehicle mix and positive foreign

exchange translation effects.

The Enlarged Europe shipments decreased on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma basis for
the corresponding period in 2021, with demand for all-new Peugeot 308, Fiat Panda, DS 4, Citroén C5 X and Alfa Romeo
Tonale, more than offset by impact of unfilled semiconductor orders, logistics challenges and discontinuation of Peugeot 108

and Citroén C1 in 2022.

Net revenues

The Enlarged Europe Net revenues increased on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma basis
for the corresponding period in 2021, mainly due to positive net pricing, favorable vehicle mix, driven by new models, BEVs

elevated used car profitability, partially offset by higher raw materials, energy, components and logistics costs.

The increase in Middle East & Africa consolidated shipments on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and
Pro Forma basis for the corresponding period in 2021 was mainly due to higher volumes of Opel Mokka, Corsa and

Crossland X.

Net revenues

The increase in Middle East & Africa Net revenues on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma
basis for the corresponding period in 2021 was primarily due to strong net pricing, including pricing actions to offset Turkish

The increase in South America shipments on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma basis for
the corresponding period in 2021 was primarily due to demand for all-new Fiat Pulse, Jeep Commander and Citroén C3, and
higher Peugeot 208 volumes, partially offset by lower Jeep Renegade and Fiat Argo volumes and discontinuation of Fiat Uno.

Net revenues

The increase in South America Net revenues on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma basis
for the corresponding period in 2021 was due to a combination of favorable net pricing, vehicle mix, volumes and foreign

In China we manufactured and distributed various Jeep models through our 50 percent owned GAC-Stellantis JV. In
January 2022, we announced a plan to increase our shareholding with GAC-Stellantis JV from 50 percent to 75 percent. Due
to lack of progress in the previously announced plan, Stellantis is cooperating with GAC Group in an orderly termination of
the joint venture. On October 31, 2022, the shareholders of the GAC-Stellantis JV approved a resolution authorizing the JV to
file for bankruptcy. Stellantis will focus on distributing imported vehicles for the Jeep brand in China through an asset-light
approach. We also locally manufacture vehicles under the Dongfeng Peugeot and Dongfeng Citroén brands in China through
the 50 percent owned DPCA JV, based in Wuhan. DPCS markets the vehicles produced by DPCA in China. Until June 2020,
vehicles under the DS brand were manufactured and marketed in China through CAPSA, a 50 percent joint venture between
PSA and the Changan group. After the sale of the joint venture by PSA and Changan to Shenzhen Baoneng Motor Co. Ltd. in
June 2020, Shenzhen Baoneng Motor Co. Ltd. continues to manufacture DS vehicles for the Company.

The results of these joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, with recognition of our share of the net
result of the joint venture in the line item “Share of the profit of equity method investees” within the Consolidated Income
Statement. We fully impaired the equity method investment in GAC-Stellantis JV at June 30, 2022. Refer to Note 3, Scope of
consolidation in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

We also produce the Jeep Compass and Jeep Meridian in India through our joint operation with FIAPL and we
recognize our related interest in the joint operation on a line by line basis.

Shipments distributed by our consolidated subsidiaries, which include vehicles produced by FIAPL, are reported in
both consolidated and combined shipments. Shipments of the GAC-Stellantis JV and DPCA JV are not included in
consolidated shipments and are only in combined shipments.

Shipments

The increase in China and India & Asia Pacific consolidated shipments on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the
IFRS and Pro Forma basis for the corresponding period in 2021 was primarily due to the increased demand for Peugeot 3008.

Net revenues

The increase in China and India & Asia Pacific Net revenues on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and
Pro Forma basis for the corresponding period in 2021 was primarily due to positive net pricing, favorable foreign exchange
translation effects and vehicle line mix.
Adjusted operating income

The increase in China and India & Asia Pacific Adjusted operating income on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to

the Pro Forma basis for the corresponding period in 2021 was primarily driven by favorable net pricing and vehicle mix,
primarily related to Jeep Grand Cherokee L, Jeep Meridian and Ram 1500, partially offset by unfavorable market mix.

Shipments

The increase in Maserati shipments on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma basis for the

corresponding period in 2021 was primarily due to the all-new Grecale launch, partially offset by reduced Ghibli and Levante
volumes particularly in China.

Net revenues

The increase in Maserati Net revenues on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the IFRS and Pro Forma basis for the
corresponding period in 2021 was primarily due to higher volumes, positive model mix driven by MC20 and favorable
foreign exchange both in U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi.

Adjusted operating income

The increase in Maserati Adjusted operating income on an IFRS basis in 2022 compared to the Pro Forma basis for

Grecale, and favorable foreign exchange transaction effects, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Overview

We require significant liquidity in order to meet our obligations and fund the business. Short-term liquidity is
required to purchase raw materials, parts and components for vehicle production, as well as to fund selling, administrative,
research and development, other expenses and funding our captive financial services business. In addition to our general
working capital and operational needs, we expect to use significant amounts of cash for the following purposes: (i) capital
expenditures to support our existing and future products; (ii) principal and interest payments under our financial obligations;
(ili) pension and employee benefit payments; (iv) capital injections to our joint ventures and M&A initiatives; and (v) funding
our captive financial services business. We make capital investments in the regions in which we operate primarily related to
initiatives to introduce new products, including for electrification and autonomous driving, enhance manufacturing efficiency,
improve capacity and for maintenance, and for regulatory and environmental compliance.

Our business and results of operations depended on our ability to achieve certain minimum vehicle shipment
volumes. As is typical for an automotive manufacturer, we have significant fixed costs and, as such, changes in our vehicle
shipment volumes could have a significant effect on profitability and liquidity. We generally receive payment from dealers
and distributors shortly after shipment, whereas there is a lag between the time we receive parts and materials from our
suppliers and the time we are required to pay for them. Therefore, during periods of increasing vehicle shipments, there is
generally a corresponding positive impact on the Company’s cash flow and liquidity. Conversely, during periods in which
vehicle shipments decline, there is generally a corresponding negative impact on the Company’s cash flow and liquidity.
Delays in shipments of vehicles, including delays in shipments in order to address quality issues or components shortage and
logistic constraints, tend to negatively affect the Company’s cash flow and liquidity. In addition, the timing of the Company’s
collections of receivables for export shipments of vehicles, fleet sales, as well as sales of propulsion systems and pre-
assembled parts of vehicles tend to be longer due to different payment terms. Although we regularly enter into factoring
transactions for such receivables in order to transfer relevant risks to the factor and to accelerate collections, a change in
vehicle shipment volumes could cause fluctuations in the Company’s working capital. The increased internationalization of
our product portfolio could also affect our working capital requirements as there could be an increased requirement to ship
vehicles to countries different from where they are produced. In addition, working capital could be affected by the trend and
seasonality of shipments of vehicles with a buy-back commitment.

Management believes that the funds currently available to Stellantis at the date of this report, in addition to those
funds that would be generated from operating and financing activities, will enable the Company to meet its obligations and
fund its businesses including funding planned investments and working capital needs, as well as fulfill the Company’s
obligations to repay its debts in the ordinary course of business.

Fidis S.p.A., a 100 percent owned captive finance company, supports working capital needs in all regions at a
Company level (including the Maserati segment), as well as selected suppliers, through the offering of receivable and payable
financing activity (also known as factoring). In addition, Fidis S.p.A. provides financing to selected dealers in Italy.

Liquidity needs are met primarily through cash generated from operations, including the sale of vehicles, service and
parts to dealers, distributors and other consumers worldwide.

The operating cash management and liquidity investment of the Company is coordinated with the objective of
ensuring effective and efficient management of the Company’s funds. We raise capital in the financial markets through
various funding sources.

Certain notes issued by the Company and its treasury subsidiaries include covenants which could be affected by
circumstances related to certain subsidiaries. In particular there are cross-default clauses which could accelerate repayments
in the event that such subsidiaries failed to pay certain of their debt obligations.

Long-term liquidity requirements could involve some level of debt refinancing as outstanding debt becomes due or
the Company is required to make principal payments. We regularly evaluate opportunities to improve our liquidity position in
order to enhance financial flexibility and to achieve and maintain a liquidity and capital position consistent with that of other
companies in the Company’s industry.


--- Page 75 ---

However, any actual or perceived limitations of the Company’s liquidity may limit the ability or willingness of
counterparties, including dealers, consumers, suppliers, lenders and financial service providers, to do business with the
Company, or require the Company to restrict additional amounts of cash to provide collateral security for its obligations. The
Company’s liquidity levels are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Risk Factors.

Available liquidity

The following table summarizes the Company’s Available liquidity:

Total Available liquidity? € 62,705 € 63,938
of which: Available liquidity of the Industrial Activities € 61,316 € 62,706

(1) Financial securities are comprised of short term or marketable securities which represent temporary investments but do not satisfy all the requirements to be classified as cash
equivalents as they may be subject to risk of change in value (even if they are short-term in nature or marketable)

(2) The majority of our liquidity is available to our treasury operations in Europe and U.S.; however, liquidity is also available to certain subsidiaries which operate in other
countries. Cash held in such countries may be subject to restrictions on transfer depending on the foreign jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate. Based on our review of
such transfer restrictions in the countries in which we operate and maintain material cash balances, (and in particular in Argentina, in which we have €959 million cash and
securities at December 31, 2022, and Russia, in which we have €121 million cash at December 31,2022), we do not believe such transfer restrictions had an adverse impact on the
Company’s ability to meet its liquidity requirements at the dates presented above. Cash and cash equivalents also include €107 million at December 31, 2022 held in bank deposits
which are restricted to the operations related to securitization programs and warehouses credit facilities of Stellantis Financial Services U.S.

Available liquidity of the Industrial Activities at December 31, 2022 decreased €1.4 billion from December 31, 2021
primarily due to the repayment of the €6.3 billion Intesa Sanpaolo credit facility, the payment of €3.4 billion of dividends, the
€0.9 billion paid in the share repurchase transaction with GM and other financing activities flows for a net negative €1.7

billion, partially offset by the €10.8 billion industrial free cash flow of the period and positive foreign exchange translation
effects.

Our Available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations resulting from business and collection
payment cycles as well as to changes in foreign exchange conversion rates. Refer to the section — Cash Flows below for
additional information regarding the change in cash and cash equivalents and refer to Note 30, Explanatory notes to the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for
additional information.

Our liquidity is principally denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollar, with the remainder being distributed in various
countries and denominated in the relevant local currencies. Out of the total €49.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and current
securities available at December 31, 2022, €22.1 billion, or 44 percent (€29.7 billion, or 58 percent, at December 31, 2021),
were denominated in Euro and €21.6 billion, or 43 percent (€15.5 billion or 30 percent at December 31, 2021), were
denominated in U.S. Dollar.

At December 31, 2022, undrawn committed credit lines of €12.7 billion include the syndicated revolving credit
facility (“RCF”) of €12.0 billion, signed in 2021 with a group of relationship banks. The RCF is available for use in general
corporate purposes and is structured in two tranches: €6.0 billion, with a 3 year tenor, and €6.0 billion, with a 5 year tenor,
with each tranche benefiting from two further extension options, each of 1-year. In June 2022, the first 1-year extension
option has been exercised. Current maturities are July 2025 and July 2027, respectively, for the two tranches.

Financial Services Facilities

Stellantis Financial Services U.S. activities are primarily funded through securitization programs which are settled
through the collection of the portfolio of financing receivables originating from dealers or consumers. The amount
outstanding under the securitization programs was €1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022.

In 2022, Stellantis Financial Services U.S. implemented two additional separate warehouse credit facilities. The first
Stellantis Financial Services U.S. facility, Stellantis Financial Services Funding, was implemented on August 31, 2022 and
matures on September 1, 2024. The €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion) commitment bears interest based on variable commercial paper
rates plus a spread or one month term Secured Overnight Funding Rate (“SOFR”) plus a spread. The second Stellantis
Financial Services U.S. facility, Stellantis Financial Services Funding II, was implemented on September 15, 2022 and
matures on September 14, 2024. The €469 million ($500 million) commitment bears interest based on variable commercial
paper rates plus a spread or one month term SOFR plus a spread. Stellantis Financial Services U.S. uses interest rate
derivatives in order to reduce the interest risks of certain warehouse credit facilities.

Refer to Note 22, Debt within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional
information.

European Investment Bank Borrowings

In July 2022, Stellantis repaid at maturity a €420 million four-year loan granted in 2018 by the European Investment
Bank (“EIB”) to support research and development (“R&D”) projects.

Intesa Sanpaolo Credit Facilities
On January 28, 2022, Stellantis repaid early the €6.3 billion credit facility entered in June 2020 with Intesa Sanpaolo
was due to mature in March 2023. The facility was structured to support the restart and transformation of Italy’s automotive

sector after the COVID-19 outbreak by providing liquidity to the Company’s business in Italy and to its Italian suppliers.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management

Risk management activities are an essential business driver to ensure the achievement of Stellantis’ objectives and
the sustainability of the business plan in the medium to long term. The Company has adopted an integrated approach aimed at
strengthening the awareness, at every level of the organization, that adequate risk assessment and management can create and
preserve value for Stellantis. A structured process has been implemented to integrate risks identification, assessment,
monitoring and mitigation into business practices, and to provide Management with information necessary to take the
appropriate decisions for achieving the strategic objectives.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework

The Stellantis risk management framework is based on the principles of the 2017 COSO Framework "Enterprise
Risk Management (“ERM”) - Integrating with Strategy and Performance" and of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.

In alignment with the COSO principles, the Stellantis ERM framework integrates risk management processes into
the management of the Company’s business with the aim of implementing the strategy, improving the performance
measurement and creating long-term value.

The framework is integrated within the Stellantis organization and corporate governance and supports the protection
of corporate assets, the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, the reliability of financial information and the
compliance with laws and regulations.

Stellantis ERM framework consists of five key components:
1. ERM Governance Structure

The risk management process is implemented across the whole organization. The Company leverages a risk
management governance that involves several committees, regions and business functions, risk owners and ERM to manage
business risks and to define the most effective strategies for their mitigation.

A Global Risk Management Committee (“GRMC”) has been established to promote a culture of proactive risk
management and monitoring throughout Stellantis and it is chaired by the Head of HR & Transformation. Other members are
representatives from the legal, finance, internal audit, risk management and business functions. The GRMC provides
guidance on the overall strategic risk management decisions and defines the Company’s risk appetite.

The ERM team within the Risk Management function is responsible for designing and updating the Enterprise Risk
Framework and working with business and global functions to support the identification, assessment, monitoring and
reporting of risk exposures and their associated mitigation actions at a department level.

2. Strategy Setting and Risk Appetite

The alignment of business objectives to strategy is achieved through Stellantis governance committees which
include senior management responsible for supporting risk governance. ERM is integrated into the strategic plan and business
objectives through the GRMC members that are part of the governance committees. Through an integrated approach
Stellantis governance committees support the Strategy Council that is ultimately responsible for risk management programs,
providing guidance and direction, reviewing and approving the overall global Enterprise Risk Assessment results and
ensuring accountability for effectively managing and mitigating significant risks. Status of risk monitoring and mitigating
activities is assessed quarterly against the risk appetite and reported to the Strategy Council by the Head of Audit &
Compliance. The Board of Directors has an oversight role over Stellantis’ strategy and risk appetite.

Stellantis aligns its risk appetite to its business plan. Risk boundaries are set through Stellantis strategy, Code of
Conduct, budgets and policies. Stellantis objectives are consistent with the organization's risk appetite.

Stellantis’ risk appetite differs by risk category as shown below.

internal policies and procedures. responsible for acting with honesty, integrity and

respect, including complying with our Code of
Conduct, applicable laws and regulations
everywhere we do business.

3. Enterprise Risk Assessment

The enterprise risk assessment is the assessment of the main risks that may affect the achievement of Stellantis’
strategy and its sustainability despite the risk mitigations in place. It is performed annually to identify and prioritize the major
risks based on their criticality, with a bottom-up approach that leverages on the departments’ risk assessment results,
continuous risk assessment surveys, and targeted interviews conducted with a representative range of regional and business
function managers.

Risk scenarios and evaluation are carried out using likelihood, impact and control effectiveness criteria.

The results of the assessment are consolidated on a risk mapping and compared with risk thresholds to determine
priority and risk treatment methods. The risk mapping is then reviewed by executive leadership before presentation for
approval to the Strategy Council and final validation by the Audit Committee.

4. Risk Mitigation and Monitoring

Major risks assigned to Strategy Council members, are detailed in more specific sub-risks and assigned to sub-risk
owners in charge of deploying adequate risk mitigation measures. Key Risk Indicators (““KRI’s) have been identified for
implementing quantitative metrics to measure and monitor sub-risks exposure in a more predictive way and to facilitate a
timely reporting of risk change. An estimated maximum loss is also evaluated for specific sub-risks scenarios in order to
provide an estimate of the potential financial impact in the event of risk materialization and to support the setting of risk
appetite.

Progress made in implementing mitigation actions, as well as KRIs trends are monitored by the ERM team and
reported to the Strategy Council periodically.

5. Risk Management Integration and Culture Dissemination

Management uses relevant information from both internal and external sources to support enterprise risk
management. To support the business in pursuing continuous risk management process improvement and to promote a
culture that proactively identify, evaluate and monitor risks, ERM relies on the support of a compliance champions network
responsible for building or updating annually the risk assessment of their departments and supervising the relative risk
mitigation action plans. Compliance Champions attend monthly meetings on ERM awareness programs.


--- Page 83 ---

Significant Risks Identified and Control Measures

Results of the annual risk assessment were consolidated into a Stellantis report for review with members of the
GRMC before the presentation of the most significant risks to the Stellantis Strategy Council. Once validated, results were
discussed with the Audit Committee, assisting the Board of Directors in their responsibility for strategic oversight of risk
management activities. Control measures and mitigating actions were identified or enhanced to ensure risks were
appropriately addressed.

The list of risks, control measures and mitigating actions presented below is not exhaustive. The sequence in which
these risks and mitigating actions are described does not reflect any order of importance, likelihood of occurrence or control
measures effectiveness.

Monitoring of risk mitigating actions and KRIs metrics are responsibility of the ERM team and compliance
champions.

Control measures and comprehensive mitigation actions for key global risks were monitored throughout the year by
Stellantis senior leaders in the regions and in the business functions to ensure that these were relevant and sufficient, under
the oversight of the related global leaders. This approach allowed Stellantis to address risks on a timely basis and ensure
effectiveness of the control measures taken. A more detailed description of these risks and other operational risks is provided
in the paragraph Risk Factors.

strengthen and improve ERM Governance. We will also continue engaging the business in reviewing our management and
monitoring activities for top-risks throughout Stellantis.

Key Risk Indicators will be reviewed to ensure their consistency with the identified risks and KRI trends will be
analyzed to identify needs for further remediation plans.

Risk Factors

We face a variety of risks in our business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing
us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also become
important factors that affect us.

Risks Related to Our Business, Strategy and Operations

If our vehicle shipment volumes deteriorate further, particularly shipments of pickup trucks and larger sport utility
vehicles in the U.S. market, and overall shipments of vehicles in the European market, our results of operations and
financial condition will suffer.

As is typical for automotive manufacturers, we have significant fixed costs primarily due to our substantial
investment in product development, property, plant and equipment and the requirements of collective bargaining agreements
and other applicable labor relations regulations. As a result, changes in certain vehicle shipment volumes could have a
disproportionately large effect on our profitability. Our overall vehicle shipment volumes in 2022 were negatively impacted
by supply chain constraints, European logistics challenges and the continuing effects of unfilled semiconductor orders.

Our profitability in North America, a region which contributed a majority of our profits and approximately 48
percent of our revenues in 2022, is particularly dependent on demand for pickup trucks and larger SUVs. Pickup trucks and
larger SUVs have historically been more profitable than other vehicles and accounted for approximately 78 percent of our
total U.S. retail vehicle shipments in 2022. Our profitability in North America is expected to continue to depend on demand
for pickup trucks and larger SUVs in North America. Accordingly, a shift in consumer demand away from these vehicles
within the North America region, and towards compact and mid-size passenger cars, whether in response to higher fuel
prices, lower disposable income due to recession, higher borrowing costs or other factors, could adversely affect our
profitability.

We are also significantly exposed to a further slowdown or downturn in economic conditions in Europe, as well as
enhanced competition in, or a deterioration of, the European vehicle market, that would trigger a decline in vehicle shipments
in that market. In 2022, we generated a significant percentage of our profits and approximately 35 percent of our revenues in
the Enlarged Europe region.

In addition, our larger vehicles, such as SUVs, tend to be priced higher and be more profitable on a per vehicle basis
than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle lines. In recent years, the profitability of these models has been
supported by strong consumer preference for SUVs, but there is no guarantee that this trend will continue in the future,
particularly in light of macroeconomic headwinds that are dampening consumer confidence. For additional information on
factors affecting our vehicle profitability, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities — Vehicle Profitability”.

Moreover, we operate with negative working capital, as we generally receive payment for vehicles within a few days
of shipment and there is a lag between the time when parts and materials are received from suppliers and when we pay for
such parts and materials. As a result, in periods in which vehicle shipments decline materially, we may suffer a significant
negative impact on cash flow and liquidity as we continue to pay suppliers for components purchased in a high-volume
environment during a period in which we receive lower proceeds from vehicle shipments. If vehicle shipments decline, or if
they were to fall short of our assumptions, due to downturn in economic conditions, changes in consumer confidence,
geopolitical events, inability to produce sufficient quantities of certain vehicles, enhanced competition in certain markets, loss
of market share, limited access to financing or other factors, such decline or shortfall could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.


--- Page 87 ---

Our business may be adversely affected by global financial markets, general economic conditions, enforcement of
government incentive programs, and geopolitical volatility as well as other macro developments over which we have little
or no control.

With operations worldwide, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by
macroeconomic factors within the various countries in which we operate, including changes in gross domestic product, the
level of consumer and business confidence, changes in interest rates for, or availability of, consumer and business credit, the
rate of unemployment, foreign currency controls and changes in exchange rates, as well as geopolitical risks, such as
government instability, social unrest, the rise of nationalism and populism and disputes between sovereign states.

We are also subject to other risks, such as increases in energy and fuel prices and fluctuations in prices of raw
materials, including as a result of tariffs or other protectionist measures, changes to vehicle purchase incentive programs, and
contractions in infrastructure spending in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, these factors may also have an
adverse effect on our ability to fully utilize our industrial capacity in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Several of
the markets in which we operate are entering a challenging macroeconomic climate with recessions probable in the near term.
Consumers are facing challenging cost inflation, negative real wages and higher borrowing rates, which may translate into
lower sales, particularly in the more profitable segments of our product mix. Unfavorable developments in any one or a
combination of these risks (which may vary from country to country) could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to execute planned strategies. For further discussion of risks
related to the automotive industry, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Industry in which We Operate’.

We have operations in a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, India and Russia and are
particularly susceptible to risks relating to local political conditions in these markets. For example, although we have not
experienced a direct material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations from the ongoing Russia-
Ukraine military conflict, we have been significantly impacted by the global economic conditions that have followed,
including substantially increased energy and commodity prices, disruptions to logistics and supply chains, and other costs.
The long term impacts of the conflict remain uncertain.

We are also subject to import and/or export restrictions (including the imposition of tariffs on raw materials and
components we procure and on the vehicles we sell), and compliance with local laws and regulations in these markets. For
example, in Brazil, we have historically received certain tax benefits and other government grants, that favorably affected our
results of operations which, if not further extended, would expire at the end of 2025. Expiration of these tax benefits and
government grants without their renewal or any change in the amount of such tax benefits or government grants could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are also subject to other risks inherent to operating globally. For a discussion of certain tax-related risks related
to our operating globally, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Taxation—We and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws and
treaties of numerous jurisdictions. Future changes to such laws or treaties could adversely affect us and our subsidiaries and
our shareholders and holders of special voting shares. In addition, the interpretation of these laws and treaties is subject to
challenge by the relevant governmental authorities”. European developments in data and digital taxation may also negatively
affect some of our autonomous driving and infotainment connected services. Unfavorable developments in any one or a
combination of these risk areas (which may vary from country to country) could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to execute planned strategies.

We are also significantly impacted by tariffs and other barriers to trade imposed between governments in various
regions, in particular the U.S. and its trading partners, China and the European Union. For example, we manufacture a
significant number of our vehicles outside the U.S. (particularly in Canada, Mexico and Italy) for import into the U.S. We
also manufacture vehicles in the U.S. that are exported to China. Tariffs or duties that impact our products could reduce
consumer demand, make our products less profitable or the cost of required raw materials more expensive or delay or limit
our access to these raw materials, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, an escalation in tariff or duty activity between the U.S. and its major trading partners could
negatively impact global economic activity, which could in turn reduce demand for our products.

We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.

Before the closing of the merger in January 2021, FCA and PSA operated independently as separate companies. The
success of the merger depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other
benefits from combining the businesses. Although significant progress has been made, the achievement of the anticipated
benefits of the merger continues to be subject to a number of uncertainties, including general competitive factors and other
challenges in the marketplace and whether we are able to integrate the businesses of FCA and PSA in an efficient and
effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in our revenues and
diversion of management’s time and energy, and could materially impact our business, cash flows, financial condition or
results of operations. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated cost savings, growth
opportunities and other benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may
take longer than expected to realize. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger, as well as
any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial
condition or results of operations, which may affect the value of our common shares.

Our future performance depends on our ability to offer innovative, attractive and relevant products.

Our success depends on, among other things, our ability to develop innovative, high-quality products that are
attractive to consumers and provide adequate profitability. We may not be able to effectively compete with other automakers
with regard to electrification, autonomous driving, mobility, artificial intelligence and other emerging trends in the industry.

In March 2022, we announced our Dare Forward 2030 long-term strategy and confirmed our plans to make
significant investments in electrification and set aggressive targets for future low emission vehicle sales. If we are unable to
deliver a broad portfolio of electrified vehicles that are competitively priced and meet consumer demands, if consumers
prefer our competitors’ electrified vehicles or if the adoption of electrified vehicles develops slower than we expect, we may
experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face challenges
developing electrified vehicles with increased vehicle range and battery energy density and we may not successfully invest in
new technologies that enable us to develop competitive electrified vehicles relative to our peers. In addition, the availability
of BEVs and PHEVs has fueled highly competitive pricing among automakers in order to win market share, which may
significantly and adversely affect our profits with respect to the sale of such vehicles. Furthermore, technological capabilities
acquired through costly investment may prove short-lived, for example, if technology and vehicle capability progresses more
quickly than expected. Vehicle electrification may also negatively affect after-sales revenues.

In certain cases, the technologies that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on
significant future technological advances by us, our partners and suppliers. These advances may not occur in a timely or
feasible manner, we may not obtain rights to use these technologies and the funds that we have budgeted or expended for
these purposes may not be adequate. Further, our competitors and others are pursuing similar and other competing
technologies, and they may acquire and implement similar or superior technologies sooner than we will or on an exclusive
basis or at a significant cost advantage. Even where we are able to develop competitive technologies, we may not be able to
profit from such developments as anticipated.

Further, as a result of the extended product development cycle and inherent difficulty in predicting consumer
acceptance, a vehicle that is expected to be attractive may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices
to be profitable. It can take several years to design and develop a new vehicle, and a number of factors may lengthen that
schedule. For example, if we determine that a safety or emissions defect, mechanical defect or non-compliance with
regulation exists with respect to a vehicle model prior to retail launch, the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until we
remedy the defect or non-compliance. Various elements may also contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle
designs, including competitors’ product introductions, fuel prices, general economic conditions and changes in consumer
preferences. In addition, vehicles we develop in order to comply with government regulations, particularly those related to
fuel efficiency, greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions standards, may not be attractive to consumers or may not generate
sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable.

If we fail to develop products that contain desirable technologies and are attractive to and accepted by consumers,
the residual value of our vehicles could be negatively impacted. In addition, the increasing pace of inclusion of new
innovations and technologies in our and our competitors’ vehicles could also negatively impact the residual value of our
vehicles. A deterioration in residual value could increase the cost that consumers pay to lease our vehicles or increase the
amount of subvention payments that we make to support our leasing programs.


--- Page 89 ---

The failure to develop and offer innovative, attractive and relevant products on a timely basis could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may continue to experience a negative impact on our operations as a result of unfilled semiconductor orders.

Our ability to manufacture vehicles depends on continued access to semiconductors and components that incorporate
semiconductors and we depend upon third parties to supply these semiconductors and related components. Many of the key
semiconductors used in our vehicles come from limited or single sources of supply.

In 2020, we began experiencing a significant semiconductor supply shortage as a result of unfilled orders, which has
resulted in increased chip delivery lead times, reduced vehicle production volumes, and increased costs to source available
semiconductors. Our overall vehicle shipment volumes in 2021 were significantly impacted by unfulfilled semiconductor
orders, representing a loss of approximately 20 percent of our planned production. The issue persisted in 2022, particularly in
North America and Enlarged Europe.

To the extent such unfilled orders continue or worsen, and we are unable to mitigate its effects, our ability to deliver
planned quantities of our vehicles will continue to be adversely affected, which may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” for further discussion of the effect that unfilled semiconductor orders has had on our operations.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could continue to disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products and the
provision of our services and adversely impact our business.

On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization,
leading to government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions, “stay-at-home” orders and similar mandates for many
individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.

COVID-19 related disruptions have had a significant negative impact on and, if repeated, may continue to negatively
impact, our supply chain and the availability and price at which we are able to source components and raw materials globally,
which could reduce the number of vehicles we will be able to sell. Furthermore, the long-term impact of the COVID-19
pandemic may lead to financial distress for our suppliers or dealers, as a result of which they may have to permanently
discontinue or substantially reduce their operations. These and other factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have had,
and could continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although the scale and efficacy of vaccination programs have led in 2022 to significantly lower mortality rates and
therefore a lifting of restrictions in many countries, future developments of the pandemic including the risk of new variants
resistant to vaccines cannot be predicted. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our future results will
depend on the scale, duration, severity and geographic reach of future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted. In the event of a significant pandemic resurgence, the ultimate impact for us will depend on the length and
severity of restrictions on business and individuals, the pandemic’s impact on customers, dealers, and suppliers, the impact of
any permanent behavioral changes that the pandemic may cause, including with respect to remote work, and any future
actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, whether government-mandated or elected by us.

The future impact of COVID-19 developments will be greater if the regions and markets that are most profitable for
us are particularly affected. See “/f our vehicle shipment volumes deteriorate further, particularly shipments of pickup trucks
and larger sport utility vehicles in the U.S. market, and shipments of vehicles in the European market, our results of
operations and financial condition will suffer”. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate many of the other risks
described in this report, including, but not limited to, the general economic conditions in which we operate, increases in the
cost of raw materials and components and disruptions to our supply chain and liquidity.

Our success largely depends on the ability of our management team to operate and manage effectively and our ability to
attract and retain experienced management and employees.

Our success largely depends on the ability of our senior executives and other members of management to effectively
manage the company and individual areas of the business. Our management team is critical to the execution of our direction
and the implementation of our strategies. If members of our management team choose to leave Stellantis, we may not be able
to replace these individuals with persons of equivalent experience and capabilities.

Attracting and retaining qualified and experienced personnel in each of our regions is critical to our competitive
position in the automotive industry. For example, our ability to attract and retain qualified software engineers is an important
component of our Dare Forward 2030 strategy.

An additional reduction in available labor, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general
macroeconomic factors, could further challenge our ability to attract and retain key personnel. If we are unable to find
adequate replacements or to attract, retain and incentivize senior executives, other key employees or new qualified personnel,
such inability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our future performance depends on our ability to successfully manage the industry-wide transition from internal
combustion engines to full electrification.

Regulatory actions and developing customer preferences in several of our principal markets are accelerating the
industry’s transition toward BEVs and away from internal combustion engines. Our performance will depend on our ability to
develop and deliver new products and technologies that are responsive to this trend, while continuing to satisfy demand for
vehicles with internal combustion engines. Therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations as we
manage the transition from internal combustion engines will depend in part on our ability to successfully allocate resources
between development and delivery of BEVs and production of internal combustion engines. In particular, because our
profitability in North America is expected to continue to depend on demand for pickup trucks and larger SUVs, our
performance will depend on our ability to continue to satisfy demand for pickup trucks and larger SUVs with internal
combustion engines in North America while developing new BEVs, or BEV versions of existing nameplates, that will be
responsive to anticipated changes in consumer preferences in that market. The process of designing and developing new
technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain
and recruit scarce talent, and we may not be successful in our efforts to develop new technologies and products that are
attractive to consumers. If we are unable to achieve our electrification goals, we may be unable to earn a sufficient return on
these investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the short to medium term, the expected economic slowdown and concomitant pressure on customers’ spending
may disproportionately impact BEVs, which are significantly more expensive than internal combustion engine vehicles. This
may adversely affect our sales of those vehicles that we are striving to bring to market.

In addition, we operate in a very competitive industry with our competitors routinely introducing new and improved
vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. As the automotive industry transitions
away from internal combustion engines and toward fully electrified vehicles, there could be increased opportunities for our
competitors, including new entrants, such as non-OEM startup technology companies that may enter into alliances with our
competitors, as well as startup OEMs, to obtain market share by introducing disruptive solutions that are attractive to
consumers. Our competitors’ integration with non-OEM startup technology companies or the emergence of new significant
OEM competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See
“The automotive industry is highly competitive and cyclical, and we may suffer from those factors more than some of our
competitors.”

Our ability to transition successfully and profitably toward BEVs is also dependent on the development and
implementation of government policies that support electrification in the markets in which we operate. If governments in the
markets in which we operate do not establish policies that support electrification, including incentives that support consumer
affordability and awareness, development of charging infrastructure and strengthening of the battery supply chain, this could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


--- Page 91 ---

Labor laws and collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions could impact our ability to increase the efficiency
of our operations, and we may be subject to work stoppages in the event we are unable to agree on collective bargaining
agreement terms or have other disagreements.

Substantially all of our production employees are represented by trade unions, covered by collective bargaining
agreements or protected by applicable labor relations regulations that may restrict our ability to modify operations and reduce
personnel costs quickly in response to changes in market conditions and demand for our products. These and other provisions
in our collective bargaining agreements may impede our ability to restructure our business successfully in order to compete
more effectively, especially with automakers whose employees are not represented by trade unions or are subject to less
stringent regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Additionally, our collective bargaining agreements with the UAW in the U.S. and Unifor in Canada will both
expire in 2023. We may be subject to work stoppages in the event that we and our labor unions are unable to agree on
collective bargaining agreement terms or have other disagreements. Any such work stoppage could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our reliance on partnerships in order to offer consumers and dealers financing and leasing services exposes us to risks.

Unlike many of our competitors, we do not own and operate a wholly-owned finance company dedicated solely to
our mass-market vehicle operations in the majority of key markets in Europe, Asia and South America. We have instead
partnered with large international banks through joint ventures or commercial agreements, in order to provide financing to
our dealers and retail consumers. In addition, although we are in the process of establishing a captive finance company in the
U.S., we do not yet have a fully operational wholly-owned provider in that market. Our lack of a fully operational wholly-
owned finance company in the U.S. and other key markets may increase the risk that our dealers and retail consumers will not
have access to sufficient financing on acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our vehicle sales in the future.

Furthermore, many of our competitors are better able to implement financing programs designed to maximize
vehicle sales in a manner that optimizes profitability for them and their finance companies on an aggregate basis. Since our
ability to compete depends on access to appropriate sources of financing for dealers and retail consumers, our reliance on
partnerships in those markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Potential capital constraints may impair the financial services providers’ ability to provide competitive financing
products to our dealers and retail consumers. For example, any financial services provider, including our joint ventures and
controlled finance companies, will also face other demands on its capital, including the need or desire to satisfy funding
requirements for dealers or consumers of our competitors as well as liquidity issues relating to other investments.
Furthermore, they may be subject to regulatory changes that may increase their cost of capital or capital requirements.

To the extent that a financial services provider is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient financing at competitive
rates to our dealers and retail consumers, such dealers and retail consumers may not have sufficient access to financing to
purchase or lease vehicles. As a result, our vehicle sales and market share may suffer, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our establishment of a captive financial services company in the U.S. will subject us to the risks inherent in that business.

In 2021, we completed the acquisition of a financial services company in the U.S., renamed Stellantis Financial
Services US Corp., and in 2022 we began the process to grow it into a full-service captive finance arm that will provide U.S.
customers, dealers and partners with a complete range of financing options. The growth and maintenance of a U.S. captive
financial services company will subject us to the risks inherent in such business, including reliance on public debt markets to
provide the capital necessary to support our financing programs, underwriting risk, default risk, compliance with laws and
regulations related to consumer lending and competition with other consumer finance companies and third-party financial
institutions.

We face risks related to changes in product distribution methods.

We are exposed to risks inherent in certain new methods of distribution, including the digitalization of points of sale
and, more broadly, the transformation of our sales network in order to respond to developing trends in the automotive
industry such as consumers’ shift towards online sales, and the use of digital tools that are altering the relationship between
brands and customers.

Stellantis is working on the development of online sales, now offered in most European countries as well as North
America. Delays in the digital transformation of distribution methods, both at points of sale and in sales networks, as well as
increased costs, whether as a result of the transformation of our sales network or new distribution methods, could impact our
ability to effectively compete with other automakers. In addition, our employees may lack the necessary skills or training to
implement or utilize such new distribution methods.

In 2023, Stellantis will also begin progressively implementing a retailer distribution model in Europe that makes
dealers “genuine agents” and is intended to enable lower distribution costs, provide price transparency and introduce a more
seamless customer experience. These and other changes in our product distribution methods may result in significant
litigation with our dealer network, lengthen the timing or pattern of when we recognize revenue and increase our working
capital requirements.

If there is a delay or failure to implement new distribution methods or such transitions are not successful, there may
be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant security breach compromising the electronic control systems contained in our vehicles could damage our
reputation, disrupt our business and adversely impact our ability to compete.

Our vehicles, as well as vehicles manufactured by other original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), contain
complex systems that control various vehicle processes including engine, transmission, safety, steering, brakes, window and
door lock functions. These electronic control systems, which are increasingly connected to external cloud-based systems, are
susceptible to cybercrime, including threats of intentional disruptions, loss of control over the vehicle, loss of functionality or
services and theft of personal information. These disruptions are likely to increase in terms of sophistication and frequency as
the level of connectivity and autonomy in our vehicles increases. In addition, we may rely on third parties for connectivity
and automation technology and services, including for the collection of our customers’ data. These third parties could
unlawfully resell or otherwise misuse such information, or suffer data breaches. A significant malfunction, disruption or
security breach compromising the electronic control systems contained in our vehicles could damage our reputation, expose
us to significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

A significant malfunction, disruption or security breach compromising the operation of our information technology
systems could damage our reputation, disrupt our business and adversely impact our ability to compete.

Our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of our
information, data processing and telecommunications systems, including our vehicle design, manufacturing, inventory
tracking and billing and payment systems, as well as other central information systems and applications, employee
workstations and other IT equipment. Our vehicles are also increasingly connected to external cloud-based systems while our
industrial facilities have become more computerized. Our systems are susceptible to cybercrime and are regularly the target
of threats from third parties, which could result in data theft, loss of control of data processed in an external cloud,
compromised IT networks and stoppages in operations. In addition, the majority of our office personnel moved to a “remote
work” model in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and full- or part-time remote work is now expected to be a permanent
option for this personnel. Remote work relies heavily on the use of remote networking and online conferencing services,
which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks.


--- Page 93 ---

A significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of any one of our computer or data processing systems,
including through the exploitation of a weakness in our systems or the systems of our suppliers or service providers, could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage and keep our manufacturing and other operations running effectively,
and may damage our reputation. The computer systems of several of our suppliers and service providers have been the
subject of unauthorized access but, to-date we have not been materially impacted by these events. A malfunction or security
breach that results in a wide or sustained disruption to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to supporting our operations, our systems collect and store confidential and sensitive data, including
information about our business, consumers and employees. As technology continues to evolve, it is expected that we will
collect and store even more data in the future and that our systems will increasingly use remote communication features that
are sensitive to both willful and unintentional security breaches. Much of our value is derived from our confidential business
information, including vehicle design, proprietary technology and trade secrets, and to the extent the confidentiality of such
information is compromised, we may lose our competitive advantage and our vehicle shipments may suffer. We also collect,
retain and use personal information, including data gathered from consumers for product development and marketing
purposes, and data obtained from employees. In the event of a breach in security that allows third parties access to this
personal information, we will be subject to a variety of laws on a global basis that could require us to provide notification to
the data owners and subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement.

For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) has increased the
stringency of European Union data protection requirements and related penalties. Non-compliance with the GDPR can result
in fines of the higher of €20 million or four percent of annual worldwide revenue. In addition, the California Consumer
Privacy Act of 2018 became effective in 2020 and provides California residents with new data privacy rights. Several other
U.S. states, and additional countries where we do business, are considering adopting laws and regulations imposing
obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Complying with any new data protection-related regulatory requirements
could force us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that has a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our reputation could also suffer in the event of a data breach, which could cause consumers to purchase their
vehicles from our competitors. Ultimately, any significant compromise in the integrity of our data security could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our reliance on joint arrangements in certain markets may adversely affect the development of our business in those
regions. In addition, the termination of our joint arrangement with GAC in China may adversely affect the development of
our business in China.

We operate, or expect to expand our presence, in markets, such as China and India, through partnerships and joint
ventures. For instance, we operate a joint venture in China with Dongfeng Motor Group, namely Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén
Automobile (“DPCA”), which manufactures vehicles under the Dongfeng Peugeot and Dongfeng Citroén brands in China,
and Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Automobile Sales Co, which markets the vehicles produced by DPCA in China. In India, we
have a joint operation with TATA Motors Limited for the production of certain of our vehicles, engines and transmissions
and joint ventures with CK Birla Group for the manufacture of vehicles and powertrains.

Although our sales in the markets where these arrangements exist are currently limited, our ability to grow in these
markets is important to our strategy and any issues with these arrangements may adversely affect those growth prospects. Our
reliance on joint arrangements to enter or expand our presence in some markets may expose us to the risk of disagreement
with our joint arrangement partners and the need to divert management resources to oversee these arrangements. Further, as
these arrangements require cooperation with third party partners, these joint arrangements may not be able to make decisions
as quickly as we would if we were operating on our own or may take actions that are different from what we would do ona
standalone basis in light of the need to consider our partners’ interests. As a result, we may be less able to respond timely to
changes in market dynamics, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.


--- Page 94 ---

In addition, in July 2022, we announced the termination of the GAC-Stellantis joint venture with Guangzhou
Automobiles Group Co., Ltd., which locally produced the Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Renegade, Jeep Compass, Jeep Grand
Commander and Jeep Commander PHEV primarily for the Chinese market. We expect to continue to market the Jeep brand
in China, but the termination of GAC-Stellantis joint venture may adversely affect the development of the Jeep brand in
China in the short-term and could adversely affect consumer perceptions about the Jeep brand in the medium-term.

Risks Related to the Industry in which We Operate

Vehicle retail sales depend heavily on affordable interest rates and availability of credit for vehicle financing and a
substantial increase in interest rates could adversely affect our business.

In certain regions, including Europe and North America, financing for new vehicle sales had recently been available
at relatively low interest rates for several years due to, among other things, expansive government monetary policies. In
response to the inflationary surge in Europe, in the UK, in the U.S. and elsewhere, central banks have aggressively increased
interest rates and such increases are being reflected in rates across credit markets, including consumer credit. More expensive
vehicle financing may make our vehicles less affordable to retail consumers or steer consumers to less expensive vehicles that
would be less profitable for us, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if
consumer interest rates continue to increase substantially or if financial service providers tighten lending standards or restrict
their lending to certain classes of credit, consumers may not desire or be able to obtain financing to purchase or lease our
vehicles. If recent and ongoing increases in inflation in key markets persist, there could be subsequent increases in the cost of
borrowing and the availability of affordable credit for vehicle financing. As a result, a substantial increase in consumer
interest rates or tightening of lending standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We face risks associated with increases in costs, disruptions of supply or shortages of raw materials, parts, components
and systems used in our vehicles.

We use a variety of raw materials in our business, including steel, aluminum, lead, polymers, elastomers, resin and
copper, and precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium, as well as electricity and natural gas. Also, as we
implement various electrified propulsion system applications throughout our portfolio, we will also depend on a significant
supply of lithium, nickel and cobalt, which are used in lithium-ion batteries.

The prices for these raw materials fluctuate, and market conditions can affect our ability to manage our costs.
Increased market power of raw material suppliers may contribute to such prices increasing. Additionally, as our production of
electric vehicles increases, we will require substantially greater access to lithium cells and related raw materials. Accordingly,
we may face shortages of these components and related raw materials and be forced to pay higher prices or, if we are unable
to obtain them, reduce or suspend production of the impacted vehicles.

Substantial increases in the prices for raw materials would increase our operating costs and could reduce profitability
if the increased costs cannot be offset by higher vehicle prices or productivity gains. In particular, certain raw materials are
sourced from a limited number of suppliers and from a limited number of countries, particularly those needed in catalytic
converters and lithium-ion batteries. From time to time these may be susceptible to supply shortages or disruptions. In
addition, our industrial efficiency will depend in part on the optimization of the raw materials and components used in the
manufacturing processes. If we fail to optimize these processes, we may face increased production costs.

We are also exposed to the risk of price fluctuations and supply disruptions and shortages, including due to supplier
disputes, particularly with regard to warranty recovery claims, supplier financial distress, tight credit markets, trade
restrictions, tariffs, natural or man-made disasters, epidemics or pandemics of diseases, or production difficulties. For
example, we experienced a significant increase in the cost of raw materials and a shortage of certain key components in 2021
and these costs continued to increase in 2022. More broadly, inflationary pressures in many of the markets in which we
operate have continued in 2022 at historically high levels in several markets and there is no certainty that the monetary policy
response in these markets will effectively reduce inflation on a timely basis. Inflation has resulted in increased wages, fuel,
freight and other costs and this trend may continue. To the extent we are unable to recoup related cost increases through
pricing actions, our profits will decrease. In addition, even if we are able to increase prices, there may be a time lag between
our cost increases and price adjustments, which may cause volatility in our earnings and cash flows. To the extent such
inflation continues, increases, or both, it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial
performance.



--- Page 95 ---

It is not possible to guarantee that we will be able to maintain arrangements with suppliers that assure access to these
raw materials at reasonable prices in the future. Fluctuations in the price of parts and components can adversely affect our
costs and profitability, and any such effect may be material. Further, trade restrictions and tariffs may be imposed, leading to
increases in the cost of raw materials and delayed or limited access to purchases of raw materials, each of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any interruption in the supply or any increase in the cost of raw materials, parts, components and systems could
negatively impact our ability to achieve our vehicle shipment objectives and profitability and delay commercial launches. The
potential impact of an interruption is particularly high in instances where a part or component is sourced exclusively from a
single supplier. Long-term interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, components and systems may result in a
material impact on vehicle production, vehicle shipment objectives, and profitability. Cost increases which cannot be
recouped through increases in vehicle prices, or countered by productivity gains, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. This risk can increase during periods of economic uncertainty such as
the crisis resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19, as a result of regional economic disruptions such as that experienced in
South America due to the deterioration in Argentina’s economic condition in recent years or, beginning in early 2022, the
Russia-Ukraine conflict. With respect to the potential impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our supply chain, see “—The
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could continue to disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products and the provision of
our services and adversely impact our business.”

The automotive industry is highly competitive and cyclical, and we may suffer from those factors more than some of our
competitors.

Substantially all of our revenues are generated in the automotive industry, which is highly competitive and cyclical,
encompassing the production and distribution of passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and components and systems. We
face competition from other international passenger car and light commercial vehicle manufacturers and distributors and
components suppliers in Europe, North America, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. These
markets are all highly competitive in terms of product quality, innovation, the introduction of new technologies, response to
new regulatory requirements, pricing, fuel economy, reliability, safety, consumer service and financial or software services
offered. Some of our competitors are also better capitalized than we are and command larger market shares, which may
enable them to compete more effectively in these markets. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of new entrants in the
automotive market, which may have technological, marketing and other capabilities, or financial resources, that are superior
to ours and of other traditional automobile manufacturers and may disrupt the industry in a way that is detrimental to us. In
particular, we are exposed to risks from non-OEM startup technology companies that may enter into alliances with our
competitors and enable them to introduce disruptive solutions, as well as risks from startup OEMs that have emerged in
recent years as a result of the increased flow of capital toward potentially disruptive OEMs. Increased competition in our key
U.S. pickup truck market may be particularly harmful to us.

If our competitors are able to successfully integrate with one another or enter into significant partnerships with non-
OEM technology companies, or if new competitors emerge as a result of the increased flow of capital toward potentially
disruptive OEMs, and we are not able to adapt effectively to increased competition, our competitors’ integration or the
emergence of new significant competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may also experience a material adverse
impact from the potential expansion of the Chinese automotive industry into European and U.S. markets and related
competition given the lower costs of production for Chinese vehicle manufacturers.

In the automotive business, sales to consumers and fleet customers are cyclical and subject to changes in the general
condition of the economy, the readiness of consumers and fleet customers to buy and their ability to obtain financing, as well
as the possible introduction of measures by governments to stimulate demand, particularly related to new technologies (for
example, technologies related to compliance with evolving emissions regulations). See “— Our business may be adversely
affected by global financial markets, general economic conditions, enforcement of government incentive programs, and
geopolitical volatility as well as other macro developments over which we have little or no control.”

The automotive industry is characterized by the constant renewal of product offerings through frequent launches of
new models and the incorporation of new technologies in those models. A negative trend in the automotive industry or our
inability to adapt effectively to external market conditions, coupled with more limited capital than our principal competitors,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


--- Page 96 ---

Intense competition, excess global manufacturing capacity and the proliferation of new products being introduced in
key segments is expected to continue to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted vehicle prices and contribute to a
challenging pricing environment in the automotive industry for the foreseeable future. In the event that industry shipments
decrease and overcapacity intensifies, our competitors may attempt to make their vehicles more attractive or less expensive to
consumers by adding vehicle enhancements, providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, or by reducing vehicle
prices whether directly or by offering option package discounts, price rebates or other sales incentives in certain markets.
Manufacturers in countries that have lower production costs may also choose to export lower-cost automobiles to more
established markets. In addition, our profitability depends in part on our ability to adjust pricing to reflect increasing
technological costs (see “—Our future performance depends on our ability to offer innovative, attractive and fuel efficient
products”). An increase in any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We are subject to risks related to natural and industrial disasters, terrorist attacks and climatic or other catastrophic
events.

Our production facilities and storage facilities for finished vehicles, as well as the production and storage facilities of
our key suppliers, are subject to risks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, other climatic
phenomena, environmental disasters and other events beyond our control, such as power loss and uncertainties arising out of
armed conflicts or terrorist attacks.

Any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of our facilities would likely disrupt our operations, delay
production, and adversely affect our product development schedules, shipments and revenue. For example, in 2011, the
earthquake off the coast of Fukushima in Japan disrupted part of PSA’s diesel engine production due to a supply shortage at
one of its Japanese suppliers.

In the last decade, seismic events affecting industrialized countries have demonstrated the risk of potential property
damage and business interruption that we are exposed to as a result of our global manufacturing footprint. We are also
exposed to industrial flood risk, with a number of our production sites identified by our industrial flood risk assessment as
potentially exposed to flood risk. The occurrence of a major incident at a single manufacturing site could compromise the
production and sale of several hundred thousand vehicles. In addition, any such catastrophic loss or significant damage could
result in significant expense to repair or replace the facility and could significantly curtail our research and development
efforts in the affected area, which could have a material adverse consequence on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Our key suppliers are similarly exposed to a potential catastrophic loss or significant damage to their facilities,
and any such loss or significant damage to a key supplier’s manufacturing facilities could disrupt our operations, delay
production, and adversely affect our product development schedules, shipments and revenue.

Measures taken to protect against climate change, and limit the impact of catastrophic climate events, such as
implementing an energy management plan, which sets out steps to reuse lost heat from industrial processes, making plants
more compact and reducing logistics-related CO, emissions, as well as using renewable energy, may also lead to increased
capital expenditures.

We are subject to risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate changes and credit risk.

We operate in numerous markets worldwide and are exposed to risks stemming from fluctuations in currency and
interest rates. The exposure to currency risk is mainly linked to differences in the geographic distribution of our
manufacturing and commercial activities, resulting in cash flows from sales being denominated in currencies different from
those of purchases or production activities.

Additionally, a significant portion of our operating cash flow is generated in U.S. Dollars and, although a portion of
our debt is denominated in U.S. Dollars, the majority of our indebtedness is denominated in Euro. Our 2022 results have
benefited from the strength of the U.S. Dollar, which has traded at historically high levels against the Euro. This trend may
reverse in future periods.

We use various forms of financing to cover funding requirements for our activities. Moreover, liquidity for industrial
activities is principally invested in variable and fixed rate or short-term financial instruments. Our financial services
businesses normally operate a matching policy to offset the impact of differences in rates of interest on the financed portfolio
and related liabilities. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates can affect our net revenues, finance costs and margins.


--- Page 97 ---

In addition, although we manage risks associated with fluctuations in currency and interest rates through financial
hedging instruments, fluctuations in currency or interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our financial services activities are also subject to the risk of insolvency of dealers and retail consumers and this risk
is expected to increase with the establishment of our U.S. captive financial service company. Despite our efforts to mitigate
such risks through the credit approval policies applied to dealers and retail consumers, we may not be able to successfully
mitigate such risks.

Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate

Current and more stringent future or incremental laws, regulations and governmental policies, including those regarding
increased fuel efficiency requirements and reduced greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions, have a significant effect on
how we do business and may increase our cost of compliance, result in additional liabilities and negatively affect our
operations and results.

As we seek to comply with government regulations, particularly those related to fuel efficiency, vehicle safety and
greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions standards, we must devote significant financial and management resources, as well as
vehicle engineering and design attention, to these legal requirements. For example, we intend to make significant
investments, including through joint ventures, to secure the supply of batteries that are a critical requirement to support our
electrification strategy and fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas compliance plans.

In addition, government regulations are not harmonized across jurisdictions and the regulations and their
interpretations are subject to change on short notice. Greenhouse gas emissions standards also apply to our production
facilities in several jurisdictions in which we operate, which may require investments to upgrade facilities and increase
operating costs. In addition, a failure to decrease the energy consumption of plants may lead to penalties, each of which may
adversely affect our profitability. In addition, the European Union’s Green Deal could result in changes to laws and
regulations, including requiring, or incentivizing, financial institutions to reduce lending to industries responsible for
significant greenhouse gas emissions, which could result in an increase in the cost of our European financings.

Regulatory requirements in relation to greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, such as by the CARB in the U.S.,
are increasingly stringent. For example, on March 9, 2022, the EPA reinstated California’s authority under the Clean Air
Actto enforce its own, more stringent, GHG emission standards for passenger vehicles and light duty trucks (the “California
Waiver”). California emission standards covered by the California Waiver may be adopted by other states and to date 17
other states and the District of Columbia (the “California Waiver States”) have adopted California’s GHG emissions
standards under the California Waiver.

Prior to the EPA’s withdrawal of the California Waiver, automotive OEMs were deemed to be compliant with
California’s GHG emissions standards if they were compliant with the EPA’s GHG standards. This “deemed to comply”
mechanism was removed from the California regulation prior to the reinstatement of the California Waiver. As interpreted by
CARB, the EPA’s reinstatement of the California Waiver together with the removal of the “deemed to comply” mechanism
means that automotive OEMs are retroactively subject to the separate California GHG standards beginning with the model
year 2021 fleet. OEMs may achieve compliance with the California GHG emission standards in several ways, including
through the sale of emission-compliant vehicles within their fleet for a given model year, through the carryforward or
carryback of excess credits generated by a compliant fleet in past or future years, by the purchase of California-specific
regulatory credits from third parties or by a combination of the foregoing.

We did not meet the California GHG targets for model year 2021 and do not expect to meet the California GHG
targets for model year 2022, as in planning both model years prior to reinstatement of the California Waiver we assumed the
ability to utilize existing credits based on regulations in force at the time. We intend to be compliant with the California GHG
program, and for those years and any other model year with deficits, we intend to seek to cover such deficits with excess

credits generated through our compliance in model years within the applicable five-year carryback period.


--- Page 98 ---

We are executing on several important steps to support our carryback strategy, including the allocation of significant
capital to the development of electrified platforms for North American vehicles and the planned electrification of the Ram
portfolio as well as agreements to secure battery production and related raw materials. Additionally, we expect to launch
thirteen battery electric vehicles in the U.S. between 2023 and 2025. For more information regarding our electrification
activities, refer to "STELLANTIS OVERVIEW- Overview of Our Business - Research and Development”. The success of our
carryback strategy depends on future levels and mix of production and sales, as well as general market demand for battery
electric vehicles, all of which are inherently speculative. Moreover, the financial impact of our efforts to change the mix of
vehicles we sell in California and the California Waiver States as we seek to comply are unclear but may be significant, and
may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in future years.

We understand that certain other automobile OEMs are subject to less stringent California GHG emissions standards
pursuant to settlement agreements entered into with CARB on terms that are not available us. We are currently evaluating the
enforceability of the California GHG emissions standards as applied by CARB, particularly in light of their retroactive
application following the EPA’s reinstatement of the California Waiver, as well as the disparate treatment of other
automotive OEMs which are not subject to the same standards. If we were to challenge the retroactive or disparate application
of the California GHG emissions standards, the direct and indirect costs of such challenge may be significant and there can be
no assurance that it would be successful.

An increasing number of cities globally have also introduced restricted traffic zones, which do not permit entry to
vehicles unless they meet strict emissions standards. As a result, consumer demand may shift towards vehicles that are able to
meet these standards, which in turn could lead to higher research and development costs and production costs for us. A failure
to comply with applicable emissions standards may lead to significant fines, vehicle recalls, the suspension of sales and third-
party claims and may adversely affect our reputation. We are particularly exposed to the risk of such penalties in markets
where regulations on fuel consumption are very stringent, particularly in Europe. In addition, the harmful effects of
atmospheric pollutants, including greenhouse gases, on ecosystems and human health have become an area of major public
concern and media attention. As a result, we may suffer significant adverse reputational consequences, in addition to
penalties, in the event of non-compliance with applicable regulations.

The number and scope of regulatory requirements, along with the costs associated with compliance, are expected to
increase significantly in the future, particularly with respect to vehicle emissions. These costs could be difficult to pass
through to consumers, particularly if consumers are not prepared to pay more for lower-emission vehicles. For a further
discussion of the regulations applicable to us, see the section “STELLANTIS OVERVIEW —Environmental and Other
Regulatory Matters” in this report. For example, EU regulations governing passenger car and LCV fleet average CO,
emissions have recently become significantly more stringent, imposing material penalties if targets are exceeded. The
increased cost of producing lower-emitting vehicles may lead to lower margins and/or lower volumes of vehicles sold. Given
the significant portion of our sales in Europe, our vehicles will be particularly exposed to such regulatory changes, as well as
other European regulatory developments (including surcharges), which may have a serious impact on the number of cars we
sell in this region and therefore on our profitability.

Our production facilities are also subject to a broad range of additional requirements governing environmental,
health and safety matters, including those relating to registration, use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and
discharges to water and air (including emissions of sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds and other
pollutants). A failure to comply with such requirements, or additional requirements imposed in the future, may result in
substantial penalties, claims and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. We may also incur substantial cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of environmental impacts
that may be associated with our current or former properties or operations.

Furthermore, some of our competitors may be capable of responding more swiftly to increased regulatory
requirements, or may bear lower compliance costs, thereby strengthening their competitive position compared to ours. See
“The automotive industry is highly competitive and cyclical, and we may suffer from those factors more than some of our
competitors”.

Most of our suppliers face similar environmental requirements and constraints. A failure by our suppliers to meet
applicable environmental laws or regulations may lead to a disruption of our supply chain or an increase in the cost of raw
materials and components used in production and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

We remain subject to ongoing diesel emissions investigations by several governmental agencies and to a number of related
private lawsuits, which may lead to further claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions, and result in additional penalties,
settlements or damage awards and may also adversely affect our reputation with consumers.

We have received inquiries from regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions as they examine the on-road
tailpipe emissions of several automakers’ vehicles and, when jurisdictionally appropriate, we continue to cooperate with these
governmental agencies and authorities.

In Europe, we have continued to work with the Italian Ministry of Transport (“MIT”) and the Dutch Vehicle
Regulator (“RDW”), the authorities that certified FCA diesel vehicles for sale in the European Union, and the UK Driver and
Vehicle Standards Agency in connection with their review of several diesel models.

We also responded to inquiries from the German authority, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (“KBA”), regarding emissions
test results for FCA diesel vehicles, and discussed the KBA reported test results, our emission control calibrations and the
features of the vehicles in question. After these initial discussions, the MIT, which has sole authority for regulatory
compliance of the vehicles it has certified, asserted its exclusive jurisdiction over the matters raised by the KBA, tested the
vehicles, determined that the vehicles complied with applicable European regulations and informed the KBA of its
determination. Thereafter, mediations were held under European Commission (“EC”) rules, between the MIT and the
German Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, which oversees the KBA, in an effort to resolve their differences.
The mediation concluded and no action was taken with respect to FCA. In May 2017, the EC announced its intention to open
an infringement procedure against Italy regarding Italy's alleged failure to respond to EC's concerns regarding certain FCA
emission control calibrations. The MIT responded to the EC's allegations by confirming that the vehicles' approval process
was properly performed. On December 2, 2021, the EC notified Italy of its position that Italy did not comply with its
obligation to enforce EU emission type approval rules.

In December 2019, the MIT notified FCA of communications with the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water
Management (“I&W”) regarding certain irregularities allegedly found by the RDW and the Dutch Center of Research TNO in
the emission levels of certain Jeep Grand Cherokee Euro 5 models and a vehicle model of another OEM containing a Euro 6
diesel engine supplied by FCA. In January 2020, the Dutch Parliament published a letter from the I&W summarizing the
conclusions of the RDW regarding those vehicles and engines and indicating an intention to order a recall and report their
findings to the Public Prosecutor, the EC and other Member States. FCA engaged with the RDW to present our positions and
cooperate to reach an appropriate resolution of this matter. FCA proposed certain updates to the relevant vehicles that have
been tested and approved by the RDW and are now being implemented. Nevertheless, this matter is still pending.

In addition, as part of the judicial investigation of several automakers in France, commencing in 2016 and 2017,
Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroén were placed under examination by the Judicial Court of Paris in June 2021 on
allegations of consumer fraud in connection with the sale of Euro 5 diesel vehicles in France between 2009 and 2015. In July
2021, FCA Italy was placed under examination by the same court for possible consumer fraud in connection with the sale of
Euro 6 diesel vehicles in France between 2014 and 2017. FCA Italy was also designated as a material witness in connection
with allegations of obstruction of the actions of an economy ministry antifraud inspector in 2016 and 2017. As is typical in a
French criminal inquiry, each of the companies were required to pay bail for the potential payment of damages and fines and
to ensure representation in court, and to provide a guarantee for the potential compensation of losses. None of these amounts
were, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company.

In July 2020, unannounced inspections took place at several of FCA’s sites in Germany, Italy and the UK at the
initiative of the Public Prosecutors of Frankfurt am Main and of Turin, as part of their investigations of potential violations of
diesel emissions regulations and consumer protection laws. In April 2022, former FCA companies received an order to
produce documents to the Public Prosecutors. In October 2022, inspections took place at the Italian offices of FCA Italy and
Maserati and at the German office of Maserati Deutschland. The Public Prosecutor of Frankfurt has also informed us that it is
conducting a criminal investigation regarding the emissions of certain PSA diesel engines installed in approximately 1,000
PSA vehicles and 29,000 Mitsubishi vehicles sold in Germany. We continue to cooperate with these investigations.


--- Page 100 ---

We also face class actions and individual claims in several European countries. Several former FCA and PSA
companies and our Dutch dealers have been served with two class actions filed in the Netherlands by Dutch foundations
seeking monetary damages and vehicle buybacks in connection with alleged emissions non-compliance of certain diesel
vehicles. We have also been notified of a potential class action on behalf of Dutch consumers alleging emissions non-
compliance of certain former FCA vehicles sold as recreational vehicles, as well as a securities class action in the
Netherlands, alleging misrepresentations by FCA, now Stellantis. A class action alleging emissions non-compliance has also
been filed in Portugal regarding former FCA vehicles and similar claims in the UK regarding former FCA and PSA vehicles
are in a pre-litigation phase. We are also defending approximately 11,300 individual consumer claims alleging emissions
non-compliance of certain former FCA vehicles in Germany and approximately 150 in Austria.

We also remain subject to a number of emissions-related private lawsuits in the U.S.

The results of the unresolved governmental inquiries and private litigation cannot be predicted at this time and these
inquiries and litigation may lead to further enforcement actions, penalties or damage awards, any of which may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that these matters and
their ultimate resolution may adversely affect our reputation with consumers, which may negatively impact demand for our
vehicles and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business operations and reputation may be impacted by various types of claims, lawsuits, and other contingencies.

We are involved in various disputes, claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to several
matters, including product liability, warranty, vehicle safety, emissions and fuel economy, product performance, asbestos,
personal injury, dealers, suppliers and other contractual relationships, alleged violations of law, environment, securities,
labor, antitrust, intellectual property, tax and other matters. We estimate such potential claims and contingent liabilities and,
where appropriate, record provisions to address these contingent liabilities. The ultimate outcome of the legal proceedings
pending against us is uncertain, and such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations. Furthermore, additional facts may come to light or we could, in the future, be subject to judgments or
enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, not all claims or potential losses
can be covered by insurance, and even if claims could be covered by insurance, we may not be able to obtain such insurance
on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such
claims. Further, publicity regarding such investigations and lawsuits, whether or not they have merit, may adversely affect
our reputation and the perception of our vehicles with retail customers, which may adversely affect demand for our vehicles,
and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For example, in November 2019, GM filed a lawsuit against FCA US, FCA N.V., now Stellantis N.V., and certain
individuals, claiming violations of the RICO Act, unfair competition and civil conspiracy in connection with allegations that
FCA US made payments to UAW officials that corrupted the bargaining process with the UAW and as a result FCA US
enjoyed unfair labor costs and operational advantages that caused harm to GM. GM also claimed that FCA US had made
concessions to the UAW in collective bargaining that the UAW was then able to extract from GM through pattern bargaining
which increased costs to GM and that this was done by FCA US in an effort to force a merger between GM and FCA N.V.
For more information regarding the GM litigation, refer to Note 26, Guarantees granted, commitments and contingent
liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

In addition, we and other Brazilian taxpayers have had significant disputes with the Brazilian tax authorities
regarding the application of Brazilian tax law. We believe that it is more likely than not that there will be no significant
impact from these disputes. However, given the current economic conditions and uncertainty in Brazil, new tax laws or more
significant changes such as tax reform may be introduced and enacted. Changes to the application of existing tax laws may
also occur or the realization of accumulated tax benefits may be limited, delayed or denied. Any of these events could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For additional risks regarding certain proceedings, see “We remain subject to ongoing diesel emissions
investigations by several governmental agencies and to a number of related private lawsuits, which may lead to further
claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions, and result in additional penalties, settlements or damage awards and may also
adversely affect our reputation with consumers”.

We face risks related to quality and vehicle safety issues, which could lead to product recalls and warranty obligations that
may result in direct costs, and any resulting loss of vehicle sales could have material adverse effects on our business.

Our performance is, in part, dependent on complying with quality and safety standards, meeting customer
expectations and maintaining our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality vehicles. Given the global
nature of our business, these standards and expectations may vary according to the markets in which we operate. For
example, vehicle safety standards imposed by regulations are increasingly stringent. In addition, consumers’ focus on vehicle
safety may increase further with the advent of autonomous and connected cars. If we fail to meet or adhere to required
vehicle safety standards, we may face penalties, become subject to other claims or liabilities or be required to recall vehicles.

The automotive industry in general has experienced a sustained increase in recall activity to address performance,
compliance or safety-related issues. For example, in 2022, we voluntarily recalled more than 248,000 Ram Heavy Duty
pickup trucks due to engine fire risk. Our costs related to vehicle recalls could increase in the future.

Recall costs substantially depend on the nature of the remedy and the number of vehicles affected and may arise
many years after a vehicle’s sale. Product recalls may also harm our reputation, force us to halt the sale of certain vehicles
and cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. Given the intense regulatory activity across the
automotive industry, ongoing compliance costs are expected to remain high. Any costs incurred, or lost vehicle sales,
resulting from product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if
we face consumer complaints, or receive information from vehicle rating services that calls into question the safety or
reliability of one of our vehicles and we do not issue a recall, or if we do not do so on a timely basis, our reputation may also
be harmed and we may lose future vehicle sales. We are also obligated under the terms of our warranty agreements to make
repairs or replace parts in our vehicles at our expense for a specified period of time. These factors, including any failure rate
that exceeds our assumptions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to corruption and bribery, as well as stakeholder expectations relating to
human rights in the supply chain and a failure to meet these legislative and stakeholder standards could lead to
enforcement actions, penalties or damage awards and may also adversely affect our reputation with consumers.

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to corruption and bribery, including those of the U.S., the United
Kingdom and France, which have an international reach and which cover the entirety of our value chain in all countries in
which we operate. We also have significant interactions with governments and governmental agencies in the areas of sales,
licensing, permits, regulatory, compliance, environmental matters and fleet sales among others. A failure to comply with laws
and regulations relating to corruption and bribery may lead to significant penalties and enforcement actions and could also
have a long-term impact on our presence in one, or more, of the markets in which such compliance failures have occurred.

In addition, our customers may have expectations relating to the production conditions and origin of the products
they purchase. Therefore, it is important for us to seek to demonstrate transparency across the entire supply chain, which may
result in additional costs being incurred. A failure by us, or any of our suppliers or subcontractors, to comply with
employment or other production standards and expectations may result in adverse consequences to our reputation, disruptions
to our supply chain and increased costs as a result of remedial measures needing to be undertaken to meet stakeholder
expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which may harm our business.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our
intellectual property rights, others may be able to compete against us using intellectual property that is the same as or similar
to our own. In addition, there can be no guarantee that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to provide us with a
competitive advantage against others who offer products similar to our products. For example, another OEM has produced a
vehicle closely resembling one of our Jeep models for sale in the U.S. We have brought multiple proceedings to stop these
practices, and have received rulings in our favor enjoining import and sale of the vehicle in the U.S. In response, the OEM
created a redesigned model for which they originally received rulings that the redesign does not infringe the Jeep model trade
dress. We are continuing to seek to enjoin the redesigned vehicle through the appeal process, but cannot be certain of the final
outcome. More generally, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing our intellectual
property and using our technology for their competitive advantage. Any such infringement could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


--- Page 102 ---

The laws of some countries in which we operate do not offer the same protection of intellectual property rights as do
the laws of the U.S. or Europe. In addition, effective intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or limited in
certain countries, making it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement there. Our inability to
protect our intellectual property rights in some countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

It may be difficult to enforce U.S. judgments against us.

We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and a substantial portion of our assets are outside of the U.S.
Most of our directors and senior management and our independent auditors are resident outside the U.S., and all or a
substantial portion of their respective assets may be located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for U.S. investors
to effect service of process within the U.S. upon these persons. It may also be difficult for U.S. investors to enforce within the
U.S. judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any state thereof. In addition,
there is uncertainty as to whether the courts outside the U.S. would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained
against us or our directors and officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any
state thereof. Therefore, it may be difficult to enforce U.S. judgments against us, our directors and officers and our
independent auditors.

As an employer with a large workforce, we face risks related to the health and safety of our employees, as well as
reputational risk related to diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity.

We employ a significant number of people who are exposed to health and safety risks as a result of their
employment. Working conditions can cause stress or discomfort that can impact employees’ health and may result in adverse
consequences for our productivity. In addition, as an automotive manufacturer, a significant number of our employees are
shift workers in production facilities, involving physical demands which may lead to occupational injury or illness. The use
or presence of certain chemicals in production processes may adversely affect the health of our employees or create a safety
risk. As a result, we could be exposed to liability from claims brought by current or former employees and our reputation,
productivity, business, financial condition and results of operations may be affected.

Our stakeholders are expected to place increased emphasis on the importance of diversity, inclusion and equal
opportunity in the workplace, against a backdrop of developing legal requirements in these areas. We may suffer adverse
effects on our reputation if we fail to meet our stakeholders’ expectations, which could result in an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could
have an adverse effect on our business and the value of our common shares.

Effective internal controls, enable us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent
fraud. While we have devoted, and will need to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to
complying with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended,
there is no assurance that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur or that we will be successful in
adequately remediating any such material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. Furthermore, as we transform our
business, our internal controls may become more complex, and we may require significantly more resources to ensure
internal controls remain effective.

Risks Related to Our Liquidity and Existing Indebtedness

Limitations on our liquidity and access to funding, as well as our significant outstanding indebtedness, may restrict our
financial and operating flexibility and our ability to execute our business strategies, obtain additional funding on
competitive terms and improve our financial condition and results of operations.

Our performance depends on, among other things, our ability to finance debt repayment obligations and planned
investments from operating cash flow, available liquidity, the renewal or refinancing of existing bank loans and/or facilities
and possible access to capital markets or other sources of financing. Our indebtedness may have important consequences on
our operations and financial results, including:


--- Page 103 ---

* we may not be able to secure additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements or general corporate purposes;

* we may need to use a portion of our projected future cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on
our indebtedness, which may reduce the amount of funds available to us for other purposes, including product
development; and

* we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, which may make us more vulnerable to a
downturn in general economic conditions or our business.

In addition, while our credit ratings are investment grade, any deterioration of our credit ratings may significantly
affect our funding and prospects.

We could, therefore, find ourselves in the position of having to seek additional financing or having to refinance
existing debt, including in unfavorable market conditions, with limited availability of funding and a general increase in
funding costs. In addition, should a general increase in market borrowing rates arise because of current inflationary pressures,
the cost of our future debt may increase. Any limitations on our liquidity, due to a further decrease in vehicle shipments, the
amount of, or restrictions in, our existing indebtedness, conditions in the credit markets, our perceived creditworthiness,
general economic conditions or otherwise, may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies and impair our
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actual or perceived limitations of our liquidity may limit the
ability or willingness of counterparties, including dealers, consumers, suppliers, lenders and financial service providers, to do
business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be exposed to shortfalls in our pension plans which may increase our pension expenses and required
contributions and, as a result, could constrain liquidity and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations.

Certain of our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded. For example, as of December 31, 2022, our
defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by approximately €2.8 billion and may be subject to significant minimum
contributions in future years. Our pension funding obligations may increase significantly if the investment performance of
plan assets does not keep pace with benefit payment obligations. Mandatory funding obligations may increase because of
lower than anticipated returns on plan assets, whether as a result of overall weak market performance or particular investment
decisions, changes in the level of interest rates used to determine required funding levels, changes in the level of benefits
provided for by the plans, or any changes in applicable law related to funding requirements. Our defined benefit plans
currently hold significant investments in equity and fixed income securities, as well as investments in less liquid instruments
such as private equity, real estate and certain hedge funds. Due to the complexity and magnitude of certain investments,
additional risks may exist, including the effects of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market capacity to
complete a particular investment strategy and an inherent divergence in objectives between the ability to manage risk in the
short term and the ability to quickly re-balance illiquid and long-term investments.

To determine the appropriate level of funding and contributions to our defined benefit plans, as well as the
investment strategy for the plans, we are required to make various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan
assets and a discount rate used to measure the obligations under defined benefit pension plans. Interest rate increases
generally will result in a decline in the value of investments in fixed income securities and the present value of the
obligations. Conversely, interest rate decreases will generally increase the value of investments in fixed income securities and
the present value of the obligations. See Note 2, Basis of preparation-Significant accounting policies—Employee benefits
within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

Any reduction in the discount rate or the value of plan assets, or any increase in the present value of obligations,
may increase our pension expenses and required contributions and, as a result, could constrain liquidity and materially
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to make required minimum funding contributions
to our U.S. pension plans, it could be subject to reportable event disclosure to the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
as well as interest and excise taxes calculated based upon the amount of any funding deficiency.

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Shares

Our maintenance of three exchange listings may adversely affect liquidity in the market for our common shares and result
in pricing differentials of Stellantis common shares between the three exchanges.

Our common shares are currently traded on the NYSE, Euronext Milan and Euronext Paris. The tripartite listing of
our common shares may adversely affect the liquidity of the shares in one or several markets. In addition, the tripartite listing
of our common shares may result in price differentials between the exchanges. Differences in the trading schedules, as well
as volatility in the exchange rate of the trading currencies, among other factors, may result in different trading prices for our
common shares on the three exchanges.

Our loyalty voting structure may concentrate voting power in a small number of our shareholders and such concentration
may increase over time.

Shareholders who hold our common shares for an uninterrupted period of at least three years may elect to receive
one special voting share in addition to each common share held, provided that such shares have been registered in the Loyalty
Register upon application by the relevant holder. If our shareholders holding a significant number of common shares for an
uninterrupted period of at least three years elect to receive special voting shares, a relatively large proportion of voting power
could be concentrated in a relatively small number of shareholders who would have significant influence over Stellantis. As a
result, the ability of other shareholders to influence decisions would be reduced.

The loyalty voting structure may affect the liquidity of our common shares and reduce our share price.

Our loyalty voting structure could reduce the liquidity of our common shares and adversely affect the trading prices
of our common shares. The loyalty voting structure is intended to reward our shareholders for maintaining long-term share
ownership by granting persons holding shares continuously for at least three years the option to elect to receive special voting
shares. Special voting shares cannot be traded and, immediately prior to the transfer of our common shares from the Loyalty
Register, any corresponding special voting shares will be transferred to us for no consideration (om niet). This loyalty voting
structure is designed to encourage a stable shareholder base and, conversely, it may deter trading by those shareholders who
are interested in gaining or retaining special voting shares. Therefore, the loyalty voting structure may reduce liquidity in our
common shares and adversely affect their trading price.

The loyalty voting structure may prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to change our management and hinder
efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common shares may be lower as a result.

Our loyalty voting structure may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of
us, even if a change of control were considered favorably by shareholders holding a majority of our common shares. As a
result of the loyalty voting structure, a relatively large proportion of voting power could be concentrated in a relatively small
number of shareholders, which may make it more difficult for third parties to seek to acquire control of us by purchasing
shares that do not benefit from the additional voting power of the special voting shares. The possibility or expectation of a
change of control transaction typically leads to higher trading prices and conversely, if that possibility is low, trading prices
may be lower. The loyalty voting structure may also prevent or discourage shareholders’ initiatives aimed at changing our
management.

Resales of Stellantis common shares following the merger may cause the market value of Stellantis common shares to
decline.

Several reference shareholders of Stellantis are subject to restrictions on share sales for a three-year period following
the merger, but will be free to sell once those restrictions expire. Furthermore, Dongfeng, which owned approximately 3
percent of our issued common shares as of February 21, 2023, has entered into an agreement with us describing the
framework for our potential repurchase of their shares in certain circumstances, but is not otherwise subject to resale
restrictions on its Stellantis common shares. All other shareholders, which own the majority of our common shares, are not
subject to any resale restrictions. The resale of such shares in the public market from time to time, particularly on the part of
Dongfeng, or on the part of any reference shareholder following expiration of the lock-up, or the perception that such resales
may occur could have the effect of depressing the market value for Stellantis common shares.

Risks Related to Taxation

The French tax authorities may revoke or disregard in whole or in part the rulings confirming the neutral tax treatment
of the merger for former PSA and the transfer of tax losses carried forward by the legacy PSA French tax consolidated

group.

The French tax authorities have confirmed that the merger will fulfill the conditions to benefit from the favorable
corporate income tax regime set forth in Article 210 A of the French Tax Code (which mainly provides for a deferral of
taxation of the capital gains realized by PSA as a result of the transfer of all its assets and liabilities pursuant to the merger).

In addition, as required by law, a tax ruling was issued on February 18, 2022 by the French tax authorities
confirming the transfer of the French tax losses carried forward of the former PSA French tax consolidated group to our
French permanent establishment and the carry-forward of such French tax losses transferred to our French permanent
establishment against future profits of our French permanent establishment and certain companies of the former PSA French
tax consolidated group pursuant to Articles 223 I-6 and 1649 nonies of the French Tax Code.

Such tax regimes and tax rulings are subject to certain conditions being met and are based on certain declarations,
representations and undertakings given by us to the French tax authorities. If the French tax authorities consider that the
relevant declarations, representations, conditions or undertakings were not correct or are not complied with, they could
revoke or disregard the rulings that have been granted in respect of the merger.

A decision by the French tax authorities to revoke or disregard the tax rulings in the future would likely result in
significant adverse tax consequences to us that could have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial
position. If the requested tax rulings are revoked or disregarded, the main adverse tax consequences for us would be that (i)
all unrealized capital gains at the level of former PSA at the time of the merger would be taxed; and (ii) the tax losses carried
forward at the level of former PSA would not have been validly transferred to our French permanent establishment or would
be forfeited.

We operate so as to be treated exclusively as a resident of the Netherlands for tax purposes after the transfer of our tax
residency to the Netherlands, but the tax authorities of other jurisdictions may treat us as also being a resident of another
jurisdiction for tax purposes.

Since we are incorporated under Dutch law, we are considered to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch corporate
income tax and Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes. In addition, with effect from January 17, 2021 and taking into
account the sanitary restrictions and limitations that applied under the COVID-19 crisis, we have operated so as to maintain
our management and organizational structure in such a manner that we (i) should be regarded to have our residence for tax
purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, withholding tax and tax treaty eligibility purposes) exclusively in the
Netherlands, (ii) should not be regarded as a tax resident of any other jurisdiction (and in particular of France or Italy) either
for domestic law purposes or for the purposes of any applicable tax treaty (notably any applicable tax treaty with the
Netherlands) and (iii) should be deemed resident only in the Netherlands, including for the purposes of the France-
Netherlands and Italy-Netherlands tax treaties. We also hold permanent establishments in France and Italy.

However, the determination of our tax residency primarily depends upon our place of effective management, which
is a question of fact based on all circumstances. Because the determination of our residency is highly fact sensitive, no
assurance can be given regarding the final determination of our tax residency.

If we were concurrently resident in the Netherlands and in another jurisdiction (applying the tax residency rules of
that jurisdiction), we may be treated as being tax resident in both jurisdictions, unless such other jurisdiction has a double tax
treaty with the Netherlands that includes either (i) a tie-breaker provision which allocates exclusive residence to one
jurisdiction only or (ii) a rule providing that the residency needs to be determined based on a mutual agreement procedure and
the jurisdictions involved agree (or, as the case may be, are compelled to agree through arbitration) that we are resident in one
jurisdiction exclusively for treaty purposes. In the latter case, if no agreement is reached in respect of the determination of the
residency, the treaty may not apply and we could be treated as being tax resident in both jurisdictions.


--- Page 106 ---

A failure to achieve or maintain exclusive tax residency in the Netherlands could result in significant adverse tax
consequences to us, our subsidiaries and our shareholders and could result in tax consequences for our shareholders that
differ from those described in the section entitled “Taxation”. The impact of this risk would differ based on the views taken
by each relevant tax authority and, in respect of the taxation of shareholders and holders of special voting shares, on the
specific situation of each shareholder or each holder of special voting shares.

We may not qualify for benefits under the tax treaties entered into between the Netherlands and other countries.

With effect from January 17, 2021, and taking into account the sanitary restrictions and limitations that applied
under the COVID-19 crisis, we operate in a manner such that we should be eligible for benefits under the tax treaties entered
into between the Netherlands and other countries, notably France, Italy and the U.S. However, our ability to qualify for such
benefits depends upon (i) being treated as a Dutch tax resident for purposes of the relevant tax treaty, (ii) the fulfillment of
the requirements contained in each applicable treaty as modified by the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty
Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (including, but not limited to, any principal purpose test clause)
and applicable domestic laws, (iii) the facts and circumstances surrounding our operations and management and (iv) the
interpretation of the relevant tax authorities and courts.

Our failure to qualify for benefits under the tax treaties entered into between the Netherlands and other countries
could result in significant adverse tax consequences to us, our subsidiaries and our shareholders and could result in tax
consequences for our shareholders that differ from those described in the section entitled “Taxation”.

The tax consequences of the Loyalty Voting Structure are uncertain.

No statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the receipt, ownership, or disposition of
special voting shares should be treated for French, Italian, UK, or U.S. tax purposes, and as a result, the tax consequences in
those jurisdictions are uncertain.

In addition, the fair market value of the special voting shares, which may be relevant to the tax consequences, is a
factual determination and is not governed by any guidance that directly addresses such a situation. Because, among other
things, the special voting shares are not transferable and a shareholder will receive amounts in respect of the special voting
shares only if we are liquidated, we believe and intend to take the position that the value of each special voting share is
minimal. However, the relevant tax authorities could assert that the value of the special voting shares as determined by us is
incorrect, which could result in significant adverse tax consequences to shareholders holding special voting shares.

The tax treatment of the loyalty voting structure is unclear and shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors in
respect of the consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of special voting shares. See “Taxation” for further
discussion.

There may be potential Passive Foreign Investment Company tax considerations for U.S. Shareholders.

We would be a “passive foreign investment company” (a ““PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect
to a U.S. shareholder (as defined in ““Taxation—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences’’) if for any taxable year in
which such U.S. shareholder held our common shares, after the application of applicable “look-through rules” (i) 75 percent
or more of our gross income for the taxable year consists of “passive income” (including dividends, interest, gains from the
sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from
unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business, as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations),
or (ii) at least 50 percent of our assets for the taxable year (averaged over the year and determined based upon value) produce
or are held for the production of “passive income”.

U.S. persons who own shares of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with
respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the dividends they receive from the PFIC, and the gain, if any, they derive from
the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC.


--- Page 107 ---

In particular, if we were treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year during which a
U.S. shareholder owned our common shares, then any gain realized by the U.S. shareholder on the sale or other disposition of
our common shares would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead, a U.S. shareholder would be treated as if it had
realized such gain ratably over its holding period for our common shares. Amounts allocated to the year of disposition and to
years before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income and amounts allocated to each other taxable year would
be taxed at the highest tax rate applicable to individuals or corporations, as appropriate, in effect for each such year to which
the gain was allocated, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. Similar treatment
may apply to certain “excess distributions” as defined in the Code.

While we believe our common shares are not stock of a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, this conclusion
is a factual determination made annually and thus may be subject to change. Moreover, we may become a PFIC in future
taxable years if there were to be changes in our assets, income or operations. In addition, because the determination of
whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC is primarily factual and because there is little administrative or judicial authority on
which to rely to make a determination, the IRS may take the position that we are a PFIC. See “Taxation” for a further
discussion.

The IRS may not agree with the determination that we should not be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and adverse tax consequences could result to us and our shareholders if the IRS were to successfully
challenge such determination.

Section 7874 of the Code provides that, under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. corporation will be treated as a U.S.
“domestic” corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In particular, certain mergers of foreign corporations with U.S.
subsidiaries can, in certain circumstances, implicate these rules. We do not believe we should be treated as a U.S. “domestic”
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the relevant law is not entirely clear, is subject to detailed but
relatively new regulations (the application of which is uncertain in various respects, and whose interaction with general
principles of U.S. tax law remains untested) and is subject to various other uncertainties. Therefore, the IRS could assert that
we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant
to Code Section 7874. In addition, changes to Section 7874 of the Code or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, or interpretations thereof, could affect our status as a foreign corporation. Such changes could potentially have
retroactive effect.

.

If the IRS successfully challenged our status as a foreign corporation, significant adverse tax consequences would
result for us and for certain of our shareholders. For example, if we were treated as a domestic corporation in the U.S., we
would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our worldwide income as if we were a U.S. domestic corporation, and
dividends we pay to non-U.S. shareholders would generally be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, among other adverse
tax consequences. If we were treated as a U.S. domestic corporation, such treatment could materially increase our U.S.
federal income tax liability.

The closing of the merger was not conditioned on our not being treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes or upon a receipt of an opinion of counsel to that effect. In addition, neither former FCA nor former PSA
requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, while we do
not believe we will be treated as a domestic corporation, no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree, or that if it
challenges such treatment, it will not succeed.

If we fail to maintain a permanent establishment in France, we could experience adverse tax consequences.

We maintain a permanent establishment in France to which the assets and liabilities of former PSA were allocated
upon the merger for French tax purposes. However, no assurance can be given regarding the existence of a permanent
establishment in France and the allocation of each asset and liability to such permanent establishment because such
determination is highly fact sensitive and may vary in case of future changes in our management and organizational structure.

If we were to fail to maintain a permanent establishment in France, the main adverse tax consequences would be that
(i) all unrealized capital gains at the level of the permanent establishment at that time would be taxed and (ii) the tax losses
carried forward that may still be available at that time would be forfeited. In addition, if, in the future, any of former PSA’s
assets and liabilities cease to be allocated to such establishment, this may result in (i) Stellantis being taxed in France on
unrealized capital gains or profits with respect to the assets and liabilities deemed transferred outside of France and (ii) a
portion of the tax losses carried forward that may still be available at that time being forfeited.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws and treaties of numerous jurisdictions. Future changes to such laws or
treaties could adversely affect us and our subsidiaries and our shareholders and holders of special voting shares. In
addition, the interpretation of these laws and treaties is subject to challenge by the relevant governmental authorities.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws, regulations and treaties in the Netherlands, France, Italy, the U.S.
and the numerous other jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate. These laws, regulations and treaties could change
on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such change could adversely affect us and our subsidiaries and our shareholders
and holders of special voting shares.

Furthermore, these laws, regulations and treaties are inherently complex and we and our subsidiaries will be
obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws, regulations and treaties to us and our
subsidiaries and our operations and businesses. The interpretation and application of these laws, regulations and treaties could
differ from that of the relevant governmental authority, which could result in administrative or judicial procedures, actions or
sanctions, which could be material.

Additionally, we operate in countries where the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(“OECD”) Pillar Two minimum taxation rules apply, and there is uncertainty surrounding the implementation and application
of these rules. The OECD Pillar Two agreement has been joined by over 140 countries and aims to ensure that multinational
corporations pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15 percent. Many countries have initiated domestic legislative procedures to
enact these global minimum tax rules. Depending on each country’s final enactment, these rules may apply to Stellantis
starting with our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2024. While we have begun to analyze the impact of the global
minimum tax rules on our operations, we are awaiting final legislation and detailed guidance to assess the full implications in
the jurisdictions in which we operate.

On December 23, 2022, South Korea became the first country to codify the global minimum tax rules in its domestic
legislation. Further details relating to the new legislation and implementation guidance are expected to be released later in
2023, therefore this new legislation is not considered substantially enacted at December 31, 2022. As we have operations in
South Korea, we will continue to evaluate the impacts to Stellantis.
