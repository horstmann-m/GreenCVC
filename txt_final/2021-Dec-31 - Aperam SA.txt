Annual Report 2021

Our history

On December 7, 2010, the Board of Directors of Aperam and the Board of Directors of ArcelorMittal approved
a proposal to its shareholders to spin-off ArcelorMittal’s stainless and specialty steels businesses. The
objective of establishing an independent company was to enable the stainless and specialty steels businesses
to benefit from better market visibility by pursuing a growth strategy focused on emerging markets and
specialty products, including electrical steel. On January 25, 2011, at an extraordinary general meeting, the
shareholders of ArcelorMittal voted to approve the spin-off proposal. The main shareholder ("Significant
Shareholder") holds 40.94% of the voting rights. Please refer to the share capital section of this Management
Report for the definition of the term "Significant shareholder".

On December 27, 2021, Aperam announced the completion of the acquisition of ELG, a global leader in
collecting, trading, processing and recycling of stainless steel scrap and high performance alloys. Please refer
to the section below “Key transactions in 2021: Acquisition of ELG’.

Key transaction in 2021: Acquisition of ELG

In 2021, Aperam opened the next chapter in Aperam’s transformation with the acquisition of ELG — a leading
recycling company for stainless steel scrap and superalloys. Aperam’s acquisition of ELG is summarized
below.

Announcement of the transaction

On May 6, 2021, Aperam announced a strategic transaction to further strengthen its cost and Environmental-
Social-Governance leadership position with the signature of a Share Purchase Agreement with Franz Haniel &
Cie. Gmbh to acquire ELG for an Enterprise Value of €357 million (Equity value €30 million) valued at
December 31, 2020 under a locked box mechanism under which Aperam owns the economic value added to
the ELG business as from January 1, 2021. Simultaneously, Aperam also announced its intention to operate
ELG as a fully separate and independent company, with ELG to continue to serve all of its customers in their
best interest. The acquisition, which was subject to customary regulatory approvals, was completed on
December 27, 2021, and is expected to generate total minimum per annum synergies of €24 million within
three years.

Strategic rationale: a compelling combination that enables lower cost, environmental improvement & growth:

Defending Aperam’s cost Synergies of €24 million per annum identified + additional potential to be

leadership position identified

Driving Aperam’s Facilitates even higher use of recycled materials which lowers energy

environmental ambition consumption and GHG emissions

Supporting Aperam’s growth Footprint in North America & Asia stainless recycling markets and superalloys

potential all offer growth potential

Opening new areas for Closing recycling loops increases scrap volumes and improves quality, and

development enables to link Aperam’s Alloys and Specialties segment with ELG’s
superalloys

Securing supply of Aperam’s Scrap is Aperam’s main raw material. Aperam uses more than 80% of scrap

key strategic raw material in its European operations

Annual Report 2!

Regulatory approvals and completion of the transaction

On November 26, 2021, Aperam announced that the pending acquisition of ELG had been approved by the
European Commission. On December 27, 2021, Aperam announced the completion of the acquisition of ELG
with all necessary regulatory approvals having been obtained without conditions.

Key financials of the transactions and new operating segment “Recycling”

ELG’s average EBITDA for the period 2017-2020 of €55 million (adjusted through the cycle on comparable
scope to assets purchased) was used to value the transaction. Applied to the acquisition price, the EV/
EBITDA multiple is 6.5x before and 4.5x post synergies.

The acquisition of ELG based on a locked box mechanism, allowed Aperam to benefit from the economic
value added to the ELG business as from January 1, 2021. Considering the locked box arrangement, 2021
ELG’s earnings are part of the preliminary bargain purchase gain recognized in Aperam's 2021 accounts.

ELG has been fully consolidated into the Aperam Group’s statement of financial position as of the acquisition
date under a new segment “Recycling”. The preliminary bargain purchase gain of EUR 117 million accounted
for by the Company at acquisition was the only transaction qualifying as an exceptional item in the operating
income of this new segment “Recycling”. As a consequence, this preliminary bargain purchase gain has been
included in the segment “Others & Eliminations”. The performance of the new segment “Recycling” will be
disclosed as from the first quarter of 2022.

The upstream value chain extension through the combination with ELG is a transformational addition to
Aperam’s business model. This will also be expressed in Aperam’s operating segments. As from the 2022
financial statements onward, ELG will be reported, together with Recyco and ASB Recycling, as part of a new
operating segment named “Recycling”. This expresses the importance that the circular economy has to
Aperam. Similar to the Leadership Journey® initiative, we will report on the initiatives that improve the
competitiveness of the Recycling segment during and after integration.

three core activities: (i) the management of exclusive direct sales of stainless steel products from our
production facilities, primarily those located in Europe; (ii) distribution of our products and, to a much lesser
extent, external suppliers’ products; and (iii) transformation services, which include the provision of value
added and customised steel solutions through further processing to meet specific customer requirements.

This segment accounted for 41.8% of external sales and 17.5% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31,
2021, and 40.2% of external sales and 11.4% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2020.

+ Alloys & Specialties. Our Alloys & Specialties segment is the fourth largest producer of specialty alloys in
the world. We specialise in the design, production and transformation of various specialty alloys and
certain specific stainless steels. Our products take the form of bars, semis, cold-rolled strips, wire and wire
rods, and plates and are offered in a wide range of grades.

This segment accounted for 10.1% of external sales and 4.9% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31,
2021, and 14.0% of external sales and 13.1% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2020.

Additionally, we have EBITDA that is reported within our "Others and Eliminations" segment. This segment,
includes corporate costs and elimination between our primary operating segments. Additionally, an
exceptional preliminary bargain purchase gain of €117 million linked to the acquisition of ELG was recorded
as of December 31, 2021. EBITDA for “Others and Eliminations” accounted for 2.0% of EBITDA for the year

has a unique capability to produce stainless and specialty steel from low cost biomass (charcoal) produced by
Aperam BioEnergia with the wood from its eucalyptus forests.

Aperam BioEnergia, and Timoteo

Aperam BioEnergia

The charcoal produced at BioEnergia is used in our steel-making process as a natural and renewable
substitute for fossil fuels (coke). This allows us to entirely eradicate the use of extractive coke and makes our
steel a leader in terms of CO, footprint. Our forest is continuously cultivated and maintained and is actually
carbon positive, which means it is acting as a carbon sink. This is why our BioEnergia unit is a source of pride
for our teams, who are keen to promote our products with ‘green’ labels.

Our forest management is based on best practices and is recognized by the Forest Stewardship Council®’s
(FSC®) certification, whose standards and principles conciliate ecological protection (flora and fauna, but also
water reserves) with social benefits and economic feasibility.

Our carbonization process is realised without any extractive fuels and with extraordinary energy efficiency,
reusing the heat and gases generated by incineration to dry the wood. Thanks to this responsible and
sustainable process, all the charcoal is produced efficiently and is sent to the furnaces of the Aperam Brazilian
steel plant, located in the same state, in the city of Timdteo, some 350 kilometers away.

Services & Solutions

We predominantly sell and distribute our products through our Services & Solutions segment, which also
includes our tubes business. The segment provides value added and customised steel solutions through
further processing in very short lead time and high service level to meet specific customer requirements. Our
distribution network is comprised of 14 steel service centres, 5 transformation facilities and 15 sales offices
with a global presence. Steel shipments from the Services and Solutions division represented 726 thousand
tonnes in 2021 and 646 thousand tonnes in 2020.

Market analysis

Market environment

Our operational results are primarily affected by external factors that impact the stainless and specialty steel
industry in general and, in particular, stainless and electrical steel pricing, demand for stainless and specialty
steels, production capacity, trends in raw material, energy prices, and fluctuations in exchange rates. In
addition to these external factors, our operational results are affected by certain factors specific to Aperam,
including several initiatives we introduced in response to the challenging economic environment. These
factors are described in greater detail below.

After Gross Domestic Product and Industrial Production growth collapsed in 2020 due to the COVID-19
induced crisis and lockdown measures globally, growth for 2021 improved, if rather unevenly, mainly due to
pandemic factors, which affected economies differently. Early 2021, new waves of infection and death rates
were affecting recovery, primarily driven by developing countries in which latest surge was impacted by new
variants, weaker social distancing, especially in areas of sub-optimal vaccine deployment. The pandemic
caused disruptions at numerous points in supply chains, from port shutdowns in China to semiconductor
checking processes in South East Asia. These disruptions pushed up inflation (while also holding back
growth), which reacted much faster and more sharply than is normal, for this stage in the business cycle.
Although the recovery in overall Gross Domestic Product is not yet complete in major economies, it has been
skewed towards demand for goods, with services still lagging. China as well as other Asian countries, like
Taiwan, have recovered quicker, thanks to aggressive health interventions, policy support and booming export
demand for key products where they can rely on their production base.

Since the beginning of 2021, overall manufacturing output has been recovering and is expected to continue to
do so at a strong pace. However, automotive production has been partially impacted by semiconductor
shortages, which is being offset by stronger than expected real demand from non-automotive manufacturing.

In the EU, gradual lifting of lockdowns is being accompanied by a rebound in “social” spending; and Industrial
Production has returned to pre-crisis levels for the Eurozone as a whole, although the recovery has been
unequal across both countries and sectors; with the rapid reopening of the economy, supply chain bottlenecks
and the rebound in energy prices are pushing up inflation. Although inflation dynamics vary across the euro
area, this is not expected to last, with inflation returning to levels below the European Central Bank objective
by the end of 2022.

For Brazil, GDP rebound in 2021, the vaccination campaign accelerated and economic activity, underpinned
by private consumption and investment, restarted as restrictions were lifted; commodity prices have returned
to their highest levels in over six years; and stainless steel apparent consumption is at a high, compared to
recent years. Brazilian exports have benefited from the global recovery, the robust demand for commodities
and a weak exchange rate. However, supply bottlenecks, lower purchasing power, higher interest rates and
policy uncertainty have slowed the pace of recovery. The labour market is recovering with some delay and
unemployment remains above pre-pandemic levels.

China with a swift recovery, driven by strong exports on the back of the reopening of overseas economies and
robust investment, has stalled in the second half of the year. A large real estate company’s default is shaking
financial markets and confidence in the sector, thereby weakening real estate investment, an important engine
of growth. Prospects for manufacturing investment have also worsened due to temporary power cuts in a
large number of provinces. Consumption growth is stable, but adverse confidence effects coupled with
inadequate social protection still hold it back. Consumer price inflation is low as there is only limited pass-
through from surging prices in upstream industries. Its manufacturing industry remained strong for the first half
of the year, which supported prices for raw materials.

Annual Report 2021

Stainless steel pricing

The stainless steel market is a global market. Stainless steel is suitable for transport over long distances, as
logistics costs represent a small proportion of overall costs. As a result, prices for commoditised stainless
steel products evolve similarly across regions. However, in general, stainless steel products are not
completely fungible due to wide variations in shape, chemical composition, quality, specifications and
application, availability of local raw material and purchase conditions - all of which impact sales prices.
Accordingly, there remains a limited market for uniform pricing or exchange trading of certain stainless steel
products.

Stainless steel is a steel alloy with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content by mass and a combination of
alloys that are added to confer certain specific properties depending on the application. The cost of alloys
used in stainless steel products varies across products and can fluctuate significantly. Prices of stainless steel
in Europe and the United States are concluded as either fixed prices or generally include two components :

* the "base price", which is negotiated with customers and depends on market supply and demand; and

* the "alloy surcharge", which is a supplementary charge to the selling price of steel that offsets the
purchase price increases in raw materials, such as nickel, chromium or molybdenum, by directly
passing these increases onto customers. The concept of the "alloy surcharge", which is calculated
using raw material purchase prices, among which some are quoted on certain accepted exchanges
like the London Metals Exchange (LME), was introduced in Europe and the United States in response
to significant volatility in the price of these materials.

Notwithstanding the application of the "alloy surcharge", the Group is still affected by changes in raw material
prices. This is particularly true for nickel, which in the last decade experienced some sudden spikes, before
coming back to a lower level. In general, when the price of nickel is falling, purchasers delay ordering
stainless steel products in order to benefit from expected price decreases. This in turn has the effect of
reducing demand in the short term. By contrast, when nickel prices are rising, purchasers tend to acquire
larger quantities of stainless steel in order to avoid having to buy at higher prices.

Globally, during 2021 stainless steel prices rose sharply, largely due to tighter balance of supply and demand
resulting from production cuts in China, high raw materials prices, global trade constraints and long lead-time
as well as high container shipping cost. In Europe, healthy demand, with limitation of imports, plus higher raw
material costs, pushed prices at a multi year high. The strong demand in China during the first half of the year,
supported by raw material momentum, kept a positive trend on domestic prices. China’s second half of the
year, saw price constrained, mostly impacted by the electricity supply shortage, which affected domestic steel
demand. The reduction of the export rebates for most steel products by 13% that was implemented on May 1,
2021, generated a stronger Chinese export prices reaction, which is pushing the global stainless price floor.

The graphs below show the price of nickel on the London Metals Exchange and the European transaction
price for Cold Rolled 304 stainless steel for the period running from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021:

Electrical steel pricing

The prices of electrical steels for Grain Oriented (GO) and Non Grain Oriented steels (NGO) were affected by
global demand and supply dynamics during 2021 but also by the logistics constraints in Asia, as with most of
the steel products. Non Grain Oriented prices were also strongly affected due to rising demand of Electric-
Vehicles (EV) and partial migration of Non Grain Oriented producers mainly in Europe and Asia, shifting
production for less productivity grades to supply EV motors demand. Grain Oriented prices were also affected
by an increasing demand for transformers worldwide, mainly in Asia for electrification.

Annual Report 2021

Demand for stainless and electrical steel and
specialty alloys products

Demand for stainless and electrical steel, which represents approximately 2.5% of the global steel market by
volume, is affected to a significant degree by trends in the global economy and industrial production. Short-
term demand is also affected by fluctuations in nickel prices, as discussed in greater detail in the "Stainless
Steel Pricing" section above.

Global domestic apparent consumption of stainless steel saw a rebound in 2021 compared to 2020 volumes,
mainly driven by China, followed by EU and USA. In Europe demand was high and pressure of unfair imports
was reduced due to high prices in Asia, high shipping costs and protection measures against unfair imports.
China’s demand has continued to grow strongly as well as export demand for stainless-containing products.
China effective slab capacity utilization rate remained above 90% for the first half of 2021, and being affected
by the energy crisis in the second half of 2021 the utilization rate reduced to the 80% levels. In Brazil, the
apparent consumption reached a historical high in Q2 2021, with a significant restocking effect, however the
second half of 2021 saw a slow down to pre-COVID-19 levels. In the USA, demand was strong from all
sectors, supporting base price increases, in a context of trade defence measures (Section 232) and shipping
disruptions.

With respect to electrical steel, Asia is the most important source of demand but also supply, and as a
consequence its prices are dependent in particular upon the Asian context. The removal of exports rebate in
China, as well as the difficulties in exports due to logistics constraints in Asia affected the international prices
environment.

The specialty alloys market saw a contrasted first half of the year 2021 after the COVID-19 induced crisis in
2020. The automotive sector partially recovered early 2021 with signs of light slow down for the second half
of 2021. The aerospace sector showed signs of improvement in terms of demand, whereas the Oil & Gas
market only showed few project developments. The LNG market was at a lower cycle due to the
postponement of the construction of several ships. On the upside, long-term technological changes continued
to drive and boost new applications for Aperam’s specialty alloys products in electronics, e-mobility or green
energy.

Production and capacity

In 2021, global stainless steel production growth was very strong, driven by the recovery of demand after its
collapse related to COVID-19 measures in 2020.

Global Cold Rolled stainless steel production is estimated to have increased by 11% in 2021 and by 14% in
Europe. China experienced a slower growth of 6% as production had already recovered in the second half of
2020. 2022 is expected to see a more moderate growth of around 3% globally, with China showing some
signs of weakening since the end of 2021.

The global structural overcapacity is estimated to have stabilized due to a slowdown of capacity added by
China, where cold rolled overcapacity is estimated to have reached 2.4 million tonnes. However, Chinese
companies announced the creation of massive new capacities in the upstream and downstream activities for
the coming two years which, combined with a more moderate growth of demand, is expected to result in a
significant increase of overcapacities.

Overall, import pressure reduced in Europe, not only because of the shipping constraints worldwide, but also
because the European Commission announced anti-dumping duties on cold-rolled stainless steel imports
from Indonesia and India. Moreover, the European Commission announced an extension of the steel
safeguards by three years from July 1, 2021.

Safeguard measures on import of steel products

“could be difference between domesiic market price and export price or cost based

The EU has prolonged for three additional years the safeguard measure currently in place on imports of
certain steel products. The prolongation applies from July 1, 2021. The initial safeguard measure was
introduced in July 2018 to protect the Union steel market against trade diversion, following the US decision to

impose, under its Section 232 legislation, duties on imports of steel into the US market. The US Section 232
measures are still in force.

On June 25, 2021, the European Commission published amending Commission Implementing Regulation
(EU) 2019/159 to prolong the safeguard measure on imports of certain steel products. These measures took

effect on July 1, 2021, for a period of three years, expiring on July 30, 2024.

The main adopted adjustments to the existing steel safeguard measures are the following:

a.

Length of the prolongation

current measures (quarterly product-specific tariff-free quotas combining country-specific and residual
quotas) are prolonged for 3 additional years until June 30, 2024.

Liberalization

the current liberalization rate of +3% per year remains unchanged for the first year of the prolongation

(until June 30, 2022);

the +3% liberalization rate could however be reviewed and, if necessary, changed for the period after

June 30, 2022.

nnual Report 20

c. Review of the regime during prolongation

— the Commission will carry out a review to see whether, on the basis of the circumstances at that time,
the measures should be terminated by June 30, 2023 (after 2 years of prolongation);

- in addition, the Commission will do a review of the functioning of the measures (not the possible
termination) to see if there would be any modality changes needed from July 1, 2022 (after the first
prolongation year) - this would be a "functioning review" like those conducted in 2019 and 2020;

- Finally, an immediate review will be triggered if the US introduces changes to its Section 232 measure
on steel that may have a significant impact on the unduly diverted trade flows it currently generates

d. Product scope
— The prolonged tariff-rate quotas apply to the same products as the current ones.

Anti-dumping measures on cold rolled stainless steel originating in China and Taiwan, India and Indonesia,
and on hot rolled stainless steel originating in China, Taiwan and Indonesia continued during the imposition of
safeguard measures.

Once the quota is filled, to avoid the imposition of double remedies, the highest level of safeguard or the anti-
dumping duties are to be applied.

On December 17, 2021, the Commission has opened the expected safeguard review on the tariff-rate quota
functioning and impact of the EU-US Section 232 deal.

In the review, the Commission will look into a number of factors, including allocations of quotas and the
current, 3% level of annual liberalization of the safeguard quotas.

The review will also focus on the new trade agreement between the EU and the US for steel products. “The
Commission will examine whether any changes to the US Section 232 measures have a significant impact on
the unduly diverted trade flows generated by the US Section 232 measures”.

In particular, the Commission intends to carry out this review in line with the following structure:

- Allocation and management of tariff-rate quotas

-—  Crowding-out of traditional trade flows

— Update of the list of developing World Trade Organisation Member countries excluded from the scope
of the measures based on their most recent level of imports

— Level of liberalization

— Change in the US Section 232 measures

— Other changes in circumstances that may require an adjustment to the level of allocation of the tariff-
rate quota

6. World Trade Organization challenge against Indonesian restrictions on raw materials

On November 22, 2019, the European Union brought a dispute in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
against Indonesian export restrictions for raw materials used in production of stainless steel.

These restrictions unfairly limit access of international producers to raw materials for steel production, notably
nickel. The European Union is also challenging subsidies that encourage use of local content by Indonesian
producers and give preference to domestic over imported goods, which goes against WTO rules.

On January 14, 2021, the European Union requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on January
25, 2021, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.

At its meeting on February 22, 2021, the Dispute Settlement Body established a panel. Brazil, Canada, China,
India, Japan, Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Turkey, Ukraine, the
United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States reserved their third-party rights.

On April 19, 2021, the European Union requested the Director-General to compose the panel.

On April 29, 2021, the Director-General composed the panel.

On November 1, 2021, the Chair of the panel informed the Dispute Settlement Body that, in accordance with

the timetable adopted thus far following consultations with the parties, the panel estimated that it would issue
its final report to the parties in the last quarter of 2022.

The above graph shows the evolution of stainless steel imports into Europe. Overall, import pressure reduced
in Europe, not only because of the shipping constraints worldwide, but also because the European
Commission announced anti-dumping duties on cold-rolled stainless steel imports from Indonesia and India.
Moreover, the European Commission announced an extension of the steel safeguards by three years from
July 1, 2021. On a more granular level, hot rolled import market share increased substantially reaching 40% at
the end of the third quarter 2021. Asian exporters have good demand and prices in their home market for cold
rolled and are therefore more prone to export hot rolled material at the moment. We are convinced that in
normalized market the hot rolled import market share would be at normal levels.

Annual Report 2021

Raw materials and Energy

Raw materials

Stainless and specialty steel production requires substantial amounts of raw materials (primarily nickel,
chromium, molybdenum, stainless and carbon steel scrap, charcoal (biomass) and iron ore). With the
exception of charcoal, which is produced internally, we are exposed to price uncertainty with respect to each
of these raw materials, which we typically purchase under short-term and long-term supply contracts, as well
as on the spot market.

Prices for these raw materials are strongly correlated with demand for stainless steel and carbon steel and
thus tend to fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand. In addition, since most of the raw
materials we use are finite resources, their prices may also fluctuate in response to any perceived scarcity of
reserves, along with the development of projects working to replace depleted reserves.

The London Metal Exchange (LME) nickel price started 2021 at a high level of U.S.$17,344 per tonne.
Supported by the recovery of the stainless steel production and positive macroeconomic factors, the LME
nickel price entered into a rally leading to a new 9-year high of U.S.$20,110 per tonne in February 2021. But
following an announcement of a large stainless steel and Nickel Pig Iron producer on new nickel unit
production capacities, the LME nickel price strongly corrected and ended the first quarter at U.S.$16,098 per
tonne. The LME nickel price remained quite stable at that level till the end of April, somewhat depressed by
fears over renewed COVID-19 deterioration in the main economies. Later on, the LME nickel price has been
volatile between U.S.$17,000 and U.S.$18,600 per tonne on alternating considerations on macro economics
and speculations on fast growing automotive electrification. It ended the second quarter at U.S.$18,450 per
tonne. In July 2021, the LME nickel prices spiked again to U.S.$ 19,892 per tonne supported by strong
fundamentals with higher than expected demand from the stainless steel and EV sectors and fresh supply
disruptions threats. After a consolidation phase, the LME nickel price found a new yearly high at U.S.$20,375
per tonne in September 2021. At the end of the third quarter the LME nickel price was traded at U.S.$18,180
per tonne amid inflation concerns and weakness across the base metal complex. During the fourth quarter,
amid COVID-19 related tensions and strong demand in Europe and US, the LME nickel prices remained
volatile ranging between U.S.$19,000 and U.S.$20,500 per tonne. The peak of U.S.$21,135 per tonne was
achieved at the end of November. At the end of year, the LME nickel price consolidated at U.S.$20,925 per
tonne. The LME nickel stocks decreased from 248,382 tonnes in January 2021 to 101,256 tonnes at the end
of the year.

After a year of sluggish development, the Ferrochrome price started 2021 on a stronger trend. The European
ferrochrome benchmark price increased to U.S.$1.18 per pound of chrome in the first quarter amid a positive
market sentiment as the producing countries faced supply disruptions as well as tightness in transportation
logistics while the global demand recovered from the pandemics lows. In this context, the European
benchmark price for the second quarter was concluded significantly higher at U.S.$1.56 per pound of chrome,
reflecting the sudden and strong price momentum of the first quarter and continued tightness in supply in
Europe. The European ferrochrome benchmark price was rolled over for the third quarter in mid June.
Following strong global demand, the European benchmark price for the fourth quarter 2021 jumped by 15%
quarter on quarter to U.S.$1.80 per pound of chrome, its highest level since the first quarter of 2009.

Molybdenum prices started the first quarter trading at U.S.$22.27 per kilogram in January to peak at U.S.
$27.56 per kilogram in February 2021 on the basis of logistical disruptions (container shortage, COVID-19
related disruptions in South America,...) combined with a recovering demand. Despite these logistical
challenges, the molybdenum prices dropped due to a temporary fallback in global demand but at the end of
the first quarter, the molybdenum price was traded at U.S.$24.36 per kilogram. In the second quarter,
supported by falling inventories, rising freight costs, social unrest in Chile together with strong demand, the
molybdenum prices reached a 7 years high of U.S.$44.15 per kilogram in June. The molybdenum price ended
the second quarter slightly lower at U.S.$42.66 per kilogram. In July, the molybdenum price remained quite
stable at U.S.$40.41 per kilogram amid a balanced market between supply and demand, with slow trading
activity. Supported by a renewed demand interest and continued freight delays disrupting the supply, the
molybdenum price increased in August to peak at U.S.$44.20 per kilogram early September. Shortly thereafter,

32


--- Page 24 ---

Annual Report 2021

driven by limited market activity, the molybdenum price softened to end the third quarter 2021 at U.S.$40.675
per kilogram. The molybdenum prices stood at U.S.$41.56 per kilogram at the end of December 2021.

Ferrous scrap prices were at a high level of U.S.$464.17 per tonne in January. But depressed demand from
the export market together with a reasonable supply put a downward pressure on the ferrous scrap prices,
dropping to U.S.$381.84 per tonne in February. Since then, the ferrous scrap price recovered on an improved
global demand and ended the first quarter at U.S.$420.64 per tonne. Boosted by the news that China
removed the export tax rebate on some steel products on May 1, higher iron ore prices and relaxed import
criteria, the ferrous scrap prices consistently increased during the second quarter. In June 2021, the ferrous
scrap price reached a new 10 year high of U.S.$510.55. At the end of the second quarter, the Ferrous scrap
price softened to U.S.$496.38 per tonne on less than expected Chinese imports. Since then, the ferrous scrap
prices have been on a consistent downward trend because finished steel sales on the export and domestic
markets have remained poor. The ferrous scrap price was down to U.S.$429.75 per tonne at the end of the
third quarter 2021. At the beginning of October, stronger demand and limited supply pushed the price to U.S.
$503.32 per tonne but as demand softened, the ferrous scrap decreased again to U.S.$450.88 per tonne at
the end of the year.

Energy

With regard to natural gas, the Timdteo production facility in Brazil has a natural gas supply contract with a
Brazilian supplier. In Europe, the Group has purchased most of its natural gas through a supply contract put in
place with ArcelorMittal Energy S.C.A. in 2015.

For electricity, in France, a supply contract was put in place with ArcelorMittal Energy S.C.A. at the beginning
of 2016, whereas in Belgium such a contract has been in place since the beginning of 2015. In Brazil,
electricity needs are mainly secured through long-term contracts with several suppliers, with balancing
requirements managed through short-term arrangements.

With regard to industrial gases, the Group procures its industrial gas requirements using short- or long-term
contracts with various suppliers in different geographical regions.

As an industrial Company, Aperam is a large consumer of electricity and natural gas. The energy and natural
gas inflation had some impact during the second half of 2021. In this environment, we also seek to balance
higher costs with efficiency gains. This is an industry wide phenomenon that has a comparable impact on
production costs across the industry. The episode shows how important our 30% energy reduction target to
2030 is and that investment in energy savings has potentially high returns.

Impact of exchange rate movements

At the end of 2020, the Euro amounted to 1.2271 U.S. dollar/Euro and 6.3779 Brazilian real/Euro. In 2021, the
Euro depreciated by 8.3% against the U.S. dollar to reach 1.1326 U.S. dollar/Euro. In 2021, the Euro
depreciated by 0.9% against the Brazilian real to reach 6.3210 Brazilian real/Euro.

Because a substantial portion of Aperam's assets, liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in
currencies other than the Euro (its presentation currency), Aperam is exposed to fluctuations in the values of
these currencies relative to the Euro. These currency fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the Euro
relative to the U.S. dollar and Brazilian real, as well as fluctuations in the currencies of the other countries in
which Aperam has significant operations and sales, can have a material impact on the results of operations.
To minimise its currency exposure, the Group enters into hedging transactions to lock in a set exchange rate
for specific transactions in non-local currencies, in accordance with its management policies.

COVID-19: health and safety review

COVID-19: Health and Safety review

Health and Safety remained as a top priority within the organisation. 2021 has continued to be dominated by
the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Aperam maintained its installed centralised crisis management approach
in the fight against the spread of the virus.

With all the measures implemented and their reinforcement at each site, Aperam has been able to limit the
spread of the virus and ensure a very low level of contamination within the sites. In addition to these
measures, many initiatives were taken on top of the general guidance such as
— rolling out a preventing testing strategy on the sites using saliva self tests;
— providing all employees a set of saliva tests for private use;
— shipping self tests for our employees and families and the local communities in India and our Indore
plant, shipment of portable oxygen generators for the local hospitals, offering the possibility to our
employees and families to come and live in the plant premises.

As a result, and thanks to the contribution of all our employees, we managed to keep our assets running with
only temporary halts to implement strict health and safety protocols, and avoided contamination with the virus
on our premises.

Aperam strongly encouraged its employees and contractors to get vaccinated. We reached in several plants a
vaccination percentage far above 90%.

When allowed by country governments, Aperam used its own medical facilities to vaccinate its employees,
as for instance in Brazil and in the plant of Genk in Belgium.

Note:

(1) Amounts shown include eliminations and other items of €22 million and €(22) million for the years ending December 31, 2021 and
2020 respectively, which includes all operations other than those that are part of the Stainless & Electrical Steel, Services & Solutions
and Alloys & Specialties operating segments, together with intersegment eliminations and/or non-operational items that are not
segmented.

The Group’s operating income for the year ending December 31, 2021, was €1,042 million, compared to an
operating income of €199 million for the year ending December 31, 2020. Group operating income increased
by 424% as higher demand supported a pricing recovery in both Europe and South America. Additional
contributions could be realized from inventory valuation gains, from the Leadership Journey® Phase 4 and the
Top Line strategy. Exceptional gains of €126 million made of €117 million preliminary bargain purchase gain
on ELG acquisition plus €9 million from the PIS/Cofins tax credits related to prior periods recognized in Brazil
also contributed to the operating income in 2021 when exceptional gains of net €50 million from the PIS/
Cofins tax credits and restructuring provisions for the Leadership Journey® Phase 4 also contributed to the
operating income in 2020.

Stainless & Electrical Steel

The operating income for the Stainless & Electrical Steel segment was €774 million for the year ending
December 31, 2021, of which an operating income of €384 million was attributable to our operations in Europe
and €390 million was attributable to our operations in South America. This is compared to operating income of
€159 million for the year ending December 31, 2020, of which an operating income of €16 million was
attributable to our operations in Europe and €143 million was attributable to our operations in South America.
The market recovery in both regions resulted in higher prices and higher volumes. The implementation of the
Top Line strategy and Leadership Journey® were also supportive. Inventory valuation gains additionally
benefited Europe.

Services & Solutions

The operating income for the Services & Solutions segment was €196 million for the year ending December
31, 2021, compared to operating income of €26 million for the yea r ending December 31, 2020. The higher
result was mainly attributable to higher shipments, higher prices and inventory valuation gains.

Alloys & Specialties

The operating income for the Alloys & Specialties segment was €50 million for the year ending December 31,
2021, compared to operating income of €36 million for the year ending December 31, 2020. The increase is
mainly attributable to higher selling price, a positive contribution from inventory valuation and cost savings
through the Leadership Journey®.

Financing income / (costs)

Financing income / (costs) include interest income, interest expense, net foreign exchange and derivative
results and other net financing costs. Financing income decreased to €2 million for the year ending December
31, 2021, compared to financing income of €40 million for the year ending December 31, 2020.

Excluding the foreign exchange and derivative results described below, net interest expense and other
financing costs for the year ending December 31, 2021 were below €1 million, including an exceptional
interest income of €7 million in Brazil for PIS/Cofins tax credits related to prior periods, compared to positive
net interest expense and other financing costs of €49 million for the year ending December 31, 2020,
including an exceptional interest income of €66 million in Brazil for PIS/Cofins tax credits related to prior
periods.

Net interest expense and other financing costs also includes recurring financing costs of €(9) million for the
year ending December 31, 2021, of which cash costs of financing of €(7) million, compared to recurring
financing costs of €(15) million for the year ending December 31, 2020, of which cash costs of financing of
€(11) million. Cash costs of financing are made of interests and other expenses related to the service of debt
and other financing facilities.

Realised and unrealised foreign exchange and derivative gains/losses were a gain of €2 million for the year
ending December 31, 2021, compared to realised and unrealised foreign exchange and derivative losses of
€(9) million for the year ending December 31, 2020. Foreign exchange results primarily relate to the
accounting revaluation of non-Euro assets, liabilities, sales and earnings. Results on derivatives primarily
relate to the financial instruments entered into in order to hedge our exposure to nickel prices but which do not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment under IFRS 9.

Income Tax

We recorded an income tax expense of €(74) million for the year ending December 31, 2021, compared to an
income tax expense of €(63) million for the year ending December 31, 2020. Our 2021 income tax expense
was primarily due to positive operational results in several countries. The income tax expense was positively
impacted by additional recognition of deferred tax assets on tax attributes in several jurisdictions as well as a
more favourable mix of the portion of profit before tax generated in lower versus higher tax rate jurisdictions
for the year ending December 31, 2021 compared to the year ending December 31, 2020. The effective tax
rate for the year ending December 31, 2021 was 7% compared to the effective tax rate of 26% for the year
ending December 31, 2020.

EU Taxonomy

Compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on EU Taxonomy

Introduction

In order to meet the EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 and reach the objectives of the European green
deal in line with the Paris Agreement, the Green Pact and the Sustainable Development Goals, investments
will have to be channelled towards sustainable projects and activities. The EU taxonomy is a classification
system establishing the conditions that an economic activity has to meet in order to qualify as sustainable, as
described by the Regulation (EU) 2020/852 published on June 18, 2020.

Specifically an activity must make a substantial contribution to one or more of the six environmental objectives
established by the European Union, without having a significant detrimental impact (the Do No Significant
Harm principle or DNSH) on the other five, while meeting certain minimum social safeguards, defined as ILO
Core Labour Conventions, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights.

Complementary regulatory developments were published in the course of 2021 specifying the content,
methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by Financial and Non-Financial undertakings
concerning the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities in their business, investments or
lending activities. A phased implementation is planned in accordance with the Disclosures Delegated Act: non-
financial undertakings shall disclose, from 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2022 on the 2021 accounts, as
a preliminary analysis the proportion of EU Taxonomy-eligible and EU Taxonomy non-eligible economic
activities in their total turnover, capital and operational expenditure (see below), whereas starting on the 2022
accounts, the alignment with all criteria contributing to climate change mitigation or adaptation (including
DNSH) will have to be assessed and reported.

® The net profit has been established according to generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with the laws and
regulations in force in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.

Annual Report 2021

Implications for non-financial undertakings

In accordance with Article 10 (1) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, non-financial undertakings shall disclose
from 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2022 the proportion of EU Taxonomy-eligible and EU Taxonomy non-
eligible economic activities in their total turnover, capital and operational expenditure.

The identification of the eligible activities corresponds to a preliminary screening of the activities likely to
participate to a transition to a low-carbon EU economy whereas the alignment entails the confirmation of the
undertaking meeting the technical criteria defined for its sector (for instance in terms of CO, intensity or level
of circularity) together with the DNSH requirements.

Turnover KPI: represents the proportion of the net turnover derived from products or services that are EU
Taxonomy-aligned. The Turnover KPI gives a static view of the companies contribution to environmental
goals.

OpEx KPI: represents the proportion of the operating expenditure associated with EU taxonomy-aligned
activities or to the CapEx plan. The operating expenditure covers direct non-capitalised costs relating to
research and development, renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and other direct
expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets or property, plant and equipment that are
necessary to ensure the continued and effective use of such assets.

CapEx KPI: represents the proportion of the capital expenditure of an activity that is either already EU
Taxonomy-aligned or is part of a credible plan to extend or reach EU taxonomy alignment. CapEx provides a
dynamic and forward-looking view of companies’ plans to transform their business activities.

Eligibility and preliminary results for Aperam

We confirm to the best of our knowledge that the financial information of Aperam presented under the
European Taxonomy section is a contributive financial information in line with the IFRS, therefore including the
elimination of intercompany balances.

Following an analysis of our activities led jointly by Aperam’s Finance and Sustainability teams, we concluded
that our entire Stainless and Electrical Steel production as well as our Services & Solutions’ service centres
are considered by EU taxonomy under economic activity: 3.9- Manufacture of iron and steel. This activity is
identified in the supplementing Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2139, which focuses on climate
mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives and are even seen as “enabling activities” meaning
activities supporting the transition of other sectors towards low-carbon operations. For further reference, the
substantial contribution criterion for Climate Change mitigation from the Iron and Steel sector is one of the
following: a COze intensity calculated at crude steel level (for blast furnaces or electric arc furnaces), or a
percentage of scrap input relative to the production output, which stands as 70% minimum for the production
of high alloy steel (stainless).

Our Alloys and Specialties business is not included in our preliminary analysis and reporting below but we are
further working on assessing their possible eligibility, in particular considering their ability to produce long-
lasting metal solutions used for their exceptional resilience in extreme temperature, corrosion and pressure
conditions while enhancing energy efficiency and both fuel cells and hydrogen development, for instance.

Lastly, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not consolidate ELG into Aperam figures for the EU
Taxonomy as only the ELG’s statement of financial position had been consolidated into Aperam’s consolidated
statement of financial position as of December 2021. We will assess ELG’s eligibility in the upcoming report,
together with Alloys & Specialties.

42


--- Page 34 ---

Annual Report 2021

Overall, according to our analysis, the activities considered eligible under the EU Taxonomy regulation
represent 90% of turnover, 85% of OpEx, and 94% of CapEX of the Aperam group as of December 31, 2021,
while the rest of the business is still under assessment.

Whereas we are confident that these eligible entities should be able to comply in full to the applicable criteria,
such as CO, intensity in Brazil and scrap ratio in Europe, we also expect further clarifications and additions to
the EU Taxonomy documentation to address some uncertainties and recognize the benefits of specific sub-

sectors. Therefore, further works will be necessary to conclude in 2022 on the share of the activity to be
considered as aligned.

Liquidity
Liquidity and capital resources

The Group's principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from its operations and its credit facilities at the
corporate level.

Because Aperam S.A. is a holding company, it is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of, and
dividends and distributions from, its operating subsidiaries to pay expenses and meet its debt service
obligations.

In management's opinion, the Group’s operations and credit facilities described below are sufficient to meet
the Group’s present requirements.

Our cash and cash equivalents amounted to €524 million and €358 million as of December 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, respectively.

Our total gross debt, which includes long and short-term debt, was €990 million (including €500 million
attributable to ELG Group) and €425 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
As of December 31, 2021, Aperam had €561 million out of the total gross debt of €990 million outstanding at
the subsidiary level (including €98 million of finance leases).

Net financial debt, defined as long-term debt plus short-term debt less cash and cash equivalents (including
short-term investments), was €466 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to €67 million at December
31, 2020.

Gearing, defined as net financial debt divided by total equity, was 16% as of December 31, 2021, compared to
3% as of December 31, 2020.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a total liquidity of €932 million, consisting of cash and cash
equivalents (including short term investments) of €524 million, committed credit lines of €300 million (revolving
credit facility of €300 million) at Aperam SA level and €108 million of committed credit lines from ELG Group.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a total liquidity of €833 million, consisting of cash and cash
equivalents (including short term investments) of €358 million and committed credit lines of €475 million
(revolving credit facility of €300 million and €100 million plus EIB financing of €75 million as described below).

Financing

Unsecured revolving credit facility

On June 6, 2017, Aperam entered into a €300 million unsecured revolving credit facility (The Facility) with a
group of 10 banks. The Facility is structured as a five-year revolving credit facility with two options of
extension by one year each, replacing its U.S.$400 million three-year secured borrowing base facility. It will be
used for the company's general corporate purposes. On May 22, 2018 and May 23, 2019, the original final
maturity date of the Facility was extended by one year, to June 6, 2024.

The Facility charges interest at a rate of EURIBOR (or LIBOR, in the case of an advance denominated in U.S.
dollars) plus a margin for the relevant interest period, which may be below one, two, three or six months, or
any other period agreed to between the parties. The Facility also charges utilisation fees on the drawn portion
of the total facility amount and commitment fees on the undrawn and uncancelled portion of the total facility
amount, payable quarterly in arrears. On June 4, 2019, the Company received the consent from all lenders to
amend the calculation of the margin to be determined on levels of a “Net Leverage Ratio” as opposed to the

44


--- Page 36 ---

Annual Report 2021

Company’s previous pricing model depending on the Group's most recent corporate rating by Standard &
Poor's, Moody's, or both.

The Facility contains financial covenants, including:
* a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of €1.25 billion; and
* a maximum consolidated total debt of 70% of consolidated tangible net worth.

As of December 31, 2021, these financial covenants were fully met and the credit facility was fully undrawn.
Unsecured short term revolving credit facility

On June 30, 2020, Aperam entered into a €100 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“The Short Term
Facility”) arranged with BGL BNP Paribas. The Short Term Facility is structured as a one year credit facility
and is guaranteed by the Office du Ducroire Luxembourg. It was used for the company's general corporate
purposes (excluding acquisitions financing) and the Company’s specific costs or expenses that have arisen in
the context of COVID-19 outbreak. This credit facility of €100 million has been extinguished on June 30, 2021.

EIB financings

On June 27, 2016, Aperam and the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced the signing of a financing
contract in the amount of €50 million, which will be dedicated to financing a research and development
programme over the 2016-2019 period, as well as an upgrade of two plants located in cohesion regions in
France & Belgium (Isbergues, Hauts-de-France and Chatelet, Hainaut respectively). This project was funded
under the Investment Plan for Europe, also known as the "Juncker Plan”. The financing contract, which is
senior unsecured, was entirely drawn down on October 16, 2018, at a rate of 1.669%, with a final maturity
date of October 16, 2028.

On February 25, 2019, the Company announced the signature of a financing contract where the EIB will make
available to Aperam an amount of €100 million. The purpose of this contract is the financing of ongoing
investments in the cold rolling and annealing & pickling lines at Aperam’s Genk plant (Belgium), as well as the
Company’s ongoing modernisation programmes in the cohesion regions of Hauts-de-France (France) -
Isbergues plant, and Hainaut (Belgium) - Chatelet plant. The financing contract, which is senior unsecured,
was entirely drawn down on March 15, 2019, at a rate of 1.307%, with a final maturity date of March 15, 2029.

On September 30, 2020, Aperam strengthened its liquidity profile with the signature of a top-up financing
contract where the EIB will make available to Aperam an amount of €75 million, in addition to the outstanding
loan of €100 million, in relation to the financing of advanced stainless steel manufacturing technologies. This
top up facility of €75 million was fully drawn on October 8, 2021, at a rate of 0.88%, with a final maturity date
of October 25, 2031.

Schuldscheindarlehen

On September 24, 2019, Aperam successfully priced an inaugural €190 million multi-tranches
Schuldscheindarlehen (debt instrument governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany) with
maturities at 4, 5, 6 and 7 years. On the back of a very positive investor perception and significantly
oversubscribed orderbook, Aperam was able to upsize the deal volume from the initially announced volume of
€100 million to ultimately €190 million. Interest rates vary from 1.10% to 1.50%. The company was able to
price all tranches at the tight end of the announced spread ranges. Aperam took advantage of the very
constructive market to secure attractive conditions and successfully diversify its creditors base.

Commercial paper programme
On July 10, 2018, Aperam received confirmation from Banque de France, as foreseen by art. D.213-2 of

“Code monétaire et financier’ of the French law, that the conditions as described in the financial
documentation of its programme of NEU commercial paper for a maximum outstanding amount of €200

million, fulfill the requirements of law. On December 31, 2021, an amount of €25 million was drawn under the
Aperam NEU CP programme.

ELG Debts

ELG debt (excluding leases) consists of €415 million of bank loans (Money market loans and overdrafts) and
€40 million of promissory Notes as of December 31, 2021.

True sales of receivables programme

The Company has established sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable programme with financial
institutions, referred to as True Sales of Receivables (“TSR”). The maximum combined amount of the
programmes that could be utilised were €370 million and €340 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Through the TSR programme, certain operating subsidiaries of Aperam surrender control, risks
and the benefits associated with the accounts receivable sold. Therefore, the amount of receivables sold is
recorded as a sale of financial assets and the balances are removed from the statement of financial position
at the moment of the sale.

The total amount of receivables sold under the TSR programme and derecognised in accordance with IFRS 9
for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 were €2 billion and €1.5 billion, respectively. Expenses
incurred under the TSR programme (reflecting the discount granted to the acquirers of the accounts
receivable) are recognised in the consolidated statement of operations as financing costs and amounted to
€(4) million and €(4) million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Recent developments

On February 11, 2022, Aperam announced having entered into a 5+1+1 years sustainably linked senior
unsecured revolving credit facility of €500 million with a syndicate of 16 banks. Such facility replaces the
existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility of €300 million signed in June 2017. In addition, Aperam
announced having entered into a 6 years sustainably linked amortizing fixed rate term facility of €300 million
with a syndicate of 10 banks. The revolving credit facility is for general corporate purposes and the term loan
is dedicated to the refinancing of maturing debts of ELG. The pricing of financing contracts are linked to two
strategic commitments of the company being firstly to become a best-in-class stainless steel manufacturer in
terms of Health & Safety by constantly outperforming its industrial average in terms of Health & Safety metrics
and to maintain its leadership in low carbon steel-making by setting an ambitious decarbonisation trajectory.

On February 11, 2022, Aperam has increased its sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable
programme with financial institutions, referred to as True Sales of Receivables (“TSR”), to a maximum
combined amount of the programmes that could be utilised to €420 million from €370 million earlier.

Credit ratings

On June 13, 2019, Aperam announced that it has requested to be withdrawn from the credit rating services of
S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investor Service, while reaffirming to maintain investment grade financial
ratios. Given the Company’s low level of debt at that time and the nature of funding needs, credit rating
services were no longer considered necessary.

On June 27, 2019, Moody's Investors Service withdrew the 'Baa3' long-term issuer rating with stable outlook
of Aperam S.A.

On July 15, 2019, S&P Global Ratings withdrew its 'BBB-' long-term issuer credit rating with stable outlook of
Aperam S.A.

A strong focus on self-help measures

From the very beginning, Aperam has always pursued a strategy designed to reinforce the robustness of our
business using self-help measures. We accomplish this by leveraging our in-house internal improvement
measures continuously and by relying on our own resources. This has proven to be a successful strategy,
one that supports our performance by reducing our reliance on external factors/resources.

As our key strategic priorities have proven their efficiency in terms of operating and financial performance over
the past years, we will remain focused on achieving Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey® through a
combination of cost, growth and mix improvement measures.

The Leadership Journey® is an initiative aimed at achieving management gains, fixed and variable cost
reductions, and increased productivity over the near and medium-term by enhancing the potential of our best
performing assets. The Leadership Journey® is composed of a number of phases that can be broadly
characterised as restructuring and cost cutting projects, upgrading best performing assets, transformation
initiatives, and growth and mix improvements. Each phase is described below.

The completed Leadership Journey® initiatives by phase and total target gains

Phase 1: 2011-2013
Restructuring & cost cutting

Completed

Phase 2: 2014-2017
Upgrading best performing assets

Completed

Phase 3: 2018-2020
Transforming the Company

Completed

Launched at the early stage of the
programme in 2011, the
restructuring initiatives focused on
the closure of non-competitive
capacities and the reduction of
fixed costs through, in particular,
process simplification and major
cost cutting investments.

Since the beginning of 2014,
major projects were launched to

help Aperam overcome
bottlenecks in its downstream
operations, improve its cost

competitiveness, and enhance its
product portfolio.

Total gains reached under Phase 1 and Phase 2:
U.S.$573 million

Launched in 2017, this phase of
the journey aimed to transform the
business and address the next
generation needs of our customers
by creating a modern, _ fully-
connected and technology-enabled
organisation. This was extended in
early 2019 to consider cost
reductions, including general
procurement and raw material
savings.
Total gains reached under Phase
3: €223 million

Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey®: Combining growth, mix and cost improvements

On November 4, 2020, Aperam announced Phase 4 of its Leadership Journey® with a cumulative target of
€150 million gains for the period 2021 - 2023 via a combination of cost, growth and mix improvement
measures. This new phase of the Leadership Journey®, comprises two stages. First, changes to our footprint
will defend our cost leadership in Europe by bundling volumes and expertise at the most efficient lines. This
forms a solid basis for stage 2 where the resulting increase in productivity will be used for the mix
improvement and growth pillars. We plan a total cash out of €90 million for Phase 4 which comprises capex
and any associated restructuring costs. As of December 31, 2021, Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey®
reached €40 million of cumulated annualized gains.

Differentiation

Structural cost: Our new rolling lines in Genk - the lowest cost plant in Europe - will play a crucial part under
this Phase and result in efficiency gains and considerable fixed cost reductions. In addition we target
improvements in our SG&A costs as we start transforming us in a post-COVID-19 era.

Growth in Specialties :The footprint concentration and increasing the flexibility of our lines will also enable
us to use specialized lines to further develop high value products. The new set-up is expected to accelerate
our top line strategy. The growth components will to some degree materialize beyond 2023 and yield gains in
addition to those included in the Phase 4 gains.

Our growth initiatives include:

+ To grow our sales of high margin value added niche products and replace low contribution margin
products, we will continue to focus on developing innovative products through our research and
development initiatives, while also leveraging our marketing and advertising efforts for wider
promotion. This includes accelerating the stainless steel consumption in the Brazilian market.

+ Our industrial footprint in Europe and South America is perfectly complemented by our global
service centres and sales networks, which are part of our Services & Solutions segment. In a
volatile market environment, we believe that the development of the Services & Solutions segment
and the provision of better customer services are key to achieving financial and operational
excellence. Our value-added services include cutting, polishing, brushing, forming, welding,
pickling, annealing and packaging. We believe that further developing the Services & Solutions
segment will not only drive additional value creation, it will also allow us to serve our customers
more effectively.

+ The Alloys & Specialties segment focuses on the design, production and transformation of various
specialty alloys and certain specific stainless steels. These products are intended for high-end
applications or to address very specific customer requirements such as for e-mobility, renewable
energies, new display devices (e.g. Oled screens), aerospace, automotive, electronics - to name
only a few. We believe that the Alloys & Specialties segment has significant growth potential,
especially in light of our R&D support and creative solutions we offer our customers. As an example,
Aperam has launched in cooperation with Tekna, a leading actor in metallic powder manufacturing,
a company named ImphyTek Powders to market Nickel and Specialty Alloy spherical powders for
advanced additive manufacturing technologies.

Differentiation: Our recognized Environmental-Social-Governance leadership, strong balance sheet, financial
discipline, and value oriented M&A approach will come as a support to our cost and growth initiatives.

In Brazil, we also have a strong link to sustainable agriculture: our production process is 100% based on
charcoal from our own sustainably cultivated eucalyptus forests, which is unique in the world and gives us one
of the best carbon footprint globally. In Brazil, about 1,000 of our employees are employed in seedling, nursing
and planting eucalyptus trees. Our forest management is based upon the best practices, recognized by the
Forest Stewardship Council’s (FSC®) certification, which standards and principles conciliate ecological
protection (flora and fauna, but also water reserves) with social benefits and economic feasibility. As an
example of our responsible forest management, we use the most ecological and advanced technologies to
preserve our forests from diseases and fire. Beyond our environmental responsibility in Brazil, we are very
proud to be recognised since our creation as one of the best companies to work for in Brazil in the steel
industry. Thanks to our own Foundation, in Brazil, we are also very much engaged in the educational, cultural,
environmental and social agendas of the communities where we operate.

Performance - A competitive footprint in Europe and Brazil

Aperam's modern production facilities allow it to support its customers’ stainless and specialty steel
requirements with a high-level of operational efficiency.

In Europe, the Group benefits from high-quality and cost-efficient plants, including the largest and most recent
electric arc furnace meltshop (Chatelet, Belgium), the largest hot rolling mill (Chatelet, Belgium), one of the
largest cold rolling mills (Genk, Belgium) and LC2I, the best-in-class integrated rolling-mill (Isbergues,
France). In January 2018, we announced a new investment project of €130 million at our Genk (Belgium)
plant. This consists of adding a new cold rolling and a new annealing and pickling line that further facilitate the
transformation of our business. With these state-of-the-art modern lines, which use the latest technology, we
can enlarge our product range to include the most demanding applications, improve lead-times and our
flexibility to meet market demands, increase the efficiency and cost competitiveness of our assets, and
continuously enhance our health, safety and environmental impact. In May 2021, we announced the
investment in revamping the hot rolling mill for long products at Imphy and re-start of the Argon Oxygen
Decarburization (AOD) converter project in Genk that was put on hold in 2019. Both projects, together with the
planned specialties center in Gueugnon, will further contribute to the reorientation of our product portfolio
towards specialties.

To adapt to market conditions, shortly after its creation, Aperam restructured its downstream operations from
29 to 17 tools in Europe. As a result, Aperam has reached an optimal loading of its most efficient assets and is
well positioned in Europe’s core markets. To benefit from the long-term growth potential of the stainless and
specialty steel market and further improve its cost competitiveness in a highly competitive environment,
Aperam aims to continue improving its operational excellence and investing in its industrial asset base with
Leadership Journey® initiatives (described in detail under the section "A strong focus on self-help measures").

In South America, Aperam is the only integrated producer of flat stainless and electrical steel. Our integrated
production facility is based in Timdteo (Brazil), and produces a wide range of stainless, electrical steel and
special carbon products. This production setup is unique, as it allows to switch flexibly between products and
markets to maximise profitability.

Based on low levels of historical and apparent consumption per capita and a developing market for stainless
steel, management foresees a substantial potential for growth in South America. In Brazil, Aperam continues
to benefit from the actions of the Leadership Journey® and Top Line strategy, while the long-term growth
prospects in terms of stainless steel consumption have remained intact.

Value add and proximity to Customer - Our Geography and Our Distribution Network

Aperam's research and development activities are closely aligned with our strategy and focus on product and
process development. The Group's Research and Development team comprises 132 employees (FTE)
spread across two main centres in Europe (Isbergues and Imphy, France) and one main centre in Timoteo,
Brazil. These centres interact closely with the Group's operating segments and partner with industrial end-
users and leading research organisations to remain at the forefront of product development. Our research
and development capabilities have contributed to both the Group's position as an industry leader and its
development of long standing and recognisable brands. Aperam concentrates a significant portion of its
research and development budget on high margin, value-added niche products, such as specialty alloys, and
on developing products with enhanced capabilities for new applications and end markets. As our customers
look to lower their carbon footprint, Aperam is present with a wide range of products answering the strong
demand for more sustainability. Some of our solutions are highlighted below.

The Company is the second largest producer in Europe, and the leading stainless and specialty steel
producer in South America. Aperam is well-positioned in both developed and emerging markets. At the Group
level, approximately 67% of Aperam’s sales are derived from developed markets and 33% from emerging
markets.

Aperam has a strong presence in the European stainless steel market. Not only are the Group's modern
production facilities in Belgium and France strategically located close to scrap generating regions, they are
also close to the Group’s major customers. Aperam’s European industrial operations have consistently
maintained high performance standards through the optimisation of production volumes, inventory and costs.

The Group also has a highly integrated and technically advanced service centre and distribution network that
is effective at maintaining direct contact with end-users through its strong sales and marketing capabilities.

Group's distribution channels are strategically located in areas of high demand and close to many end-users.
The Group's global distribution network enables it to tailor its products to address specific customer needs,
thereby facilitating the maintenance of our market share and the capturing of growth opportunities. The
Group's customer base is well diversified, consisting of a number of blue chip clients.

Our Premium Products - Alloys and Stainless Specialties

Aperam offers a wide range of products, including high margin value-added niche products to a diversified
customer base in both emerging and developed markets. It is this diverse product offering, sold to a wide
range of customers across numerous industries, that allows the Group to enjoy greater stability and to
mitigate some of the risks and cyclicity inherent in certain markets.

The Group's products are mainly sold to end-users in the automotive, building and construction, catering and
appliance, energy and chemicals, and transportation industries. Our electrical steel products are primarily sold
to customers in the electric motors, generators and transformers industries. We are the fourth largest global
producer of specialty alloys and the largest producer of alloys wire rods and strips, which are sold to
customers in the aerospace, automotive, electronics, petrochemical, and oil & gas industries. As previously
mentioned, Aperam is also engaged in the Nickel and Specialty Alloy spherical powders for advanced additive
manufacturing and metal injection molding technologies though its JV ImphyTek Powders SAS.

Principal risks and uncertainties related to the
Company and the stainless and specialty
steel industry

The following major factors could cause actual results to materially differ from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements included throughout this Annual Report:

Macro-economic & geopolitical risks indirectly impacting Aperam

Global economic cycle downturn

The global economic recovery from the recession caused by responses to the COVID-19 pandemic is
expected to continue but to slow down in 2022 compared to 2021, still impacted by high sovereign debts, and
high inflation.

Aperam’s business and results of operations are substantially affected by international, national and regional
economic conditions, including geopolitical risks that could disrupt the economic activity in affected countries.
A period of slow growth in emerging economies that are, or are expected to become, substantial consumers of
stainless and specialty steels (such as China, Brazil, Russia and India, as well as other emerging Asian
markets and the Middle East) would have a material adverse effect on the stainless and specialty steel
industry.

Overcapacity

In addition to economic conditions, the stainless steel industry is affected by global production capacity and
fluctuations in stainless steel imports and exports. Production capacity in the developing world, particularly
China and Indonesia, has increased substantially, with China being the largest global stainless steel producer.
Accordingly, the balance between China’s domestic production and consumption is an important factor

58

impacting global stainless steel prices. Stainless steel exports from these countries, or conditions favourable
to them (such as excess capacity in China / Indonesia and/or higher market prices for stainless steel in
markets outside of China/Indonesia) can have a significant impact on stainless steel prices in other markets,
including Europe and South America. Over the short- to medium-term, Aperam is exposed to the risk of
stainless steel production increases in China and other markets (including Indonesia) outstripping increases in
real demand, which may weigh on price recovery in the industry as a whole.

China slowdown

A reduction in China’s economic growth rate, with a resulting reduction in stainless and specialty steel
consumption, coupled with China’s expansion of steel-making capacity, could continue to substantially
weaken both domestic and global stainless and specialty steel demand and pricing.

The risks of nickel price fluctuation, raw material price uncertainty, material margin squeeze,
over dependency of main suppliers and electricity

Aperam’s profitability correlates, amongst other factors, with nickel prices. A significant decrease in the price
of nickel would have a negative impact on apparent demand and base prices due to “wait and see” behaviour
by customers. Furthermore, nickel is listed on the LME and thus subject to the fluctuation of the financial
markets. Stainless and specialty steel production requires substantial amounts of raw materials (primarily
nickel, chromium, molybdenum, stainless and carbon steel scrap, charcoal (biomass) and iron ore), which can
lead to an over-dependence on its main suppliers. Aperam is also exposed to price uncertainty and material
margin squeeze with respect to each of these raw materials, which it mainly purchases under short- and long-
term contracts, but also on the spot market.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates

Aperam operates and sells its products globally, and a substantial portion of its assets, liabilities, costs, sales
and income are denominated in currencies other than the Euro (Aperam’s reporting currency). Accordingly,
currency fluctuations triggered by inflationary movements or other factors, especially the fluctuation of the
value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real, as well as fluctuations in the currencies of
the other countries in which Aperam has significant operations and/or sales, could have a material impact on
its results of operations.

Litigation risks (product liability, patent infringement, commercial practices, employment,
employment benefits, taxes, environmental issues, health & safety)

A number of lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been and may be asserted against Aperam in relation to
the conduct of its currently and formerly owned businesses, including those pertaining to product liability,
patent infringement, commercial practices, employment, employee benefits, taxes, environmental aspects,
health and safety, and occupational disease. In particular, Aperam is subject to a broad range of
environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdiction in which it operates. Such laws and regulations
focus in particular on air emissions, wastewater storage, treatment and discharges, the use and handling of
hazardous or toxic substances, slag treatment, soil pollution, waste disposal practices and the remediation of
environmental contamination.

Due to the uncertainties of litigation, no assurance can be given that the Company will prevail on all claims
made against it in the lawsuits that it currently faces or that additional claims will not be made against it in the
future. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims
or proceedings may have an outcome that is adverse to Aperam, Management does not believe that the
disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on Aperam’s financial

59

nnual Report 20

condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations for that period.

Risks of lack of competitiveness of the workforce costs, of losing key competencies and
inability of attracting new key competencies, and social conflicts

A lack of competitiveness in workforce costs might have a material adverse effect on Aperam’s cost position.
Aperam’s key personnel have extensive knowledge on its business and, more generally, on the stainless and
specialty steel sector as a whole. Its inability to retain key personnel and/or the experience of social conflicts
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Customer risks in respect to default and credit insurance companies refusing to insure the
risks

Due to the challenging economic climate, Aperam might experience increased exposure to customer defaults
or situations where credit insurance companies refuse to insure the recoverability risks of its receivables.
Such a scenario could have a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Cybersecurity risks

Aperam’s operations depend on the secure and reliable performance of its information technology systems.
An increasing number of companies, including Aperam, are experiencing intrusion and phishing attempts for
money transfers, as well as attempts at disabling information technology systems. If such attempts would
succeed, they could cause application unavailability, data confidentiality failures, adverse publicity and, in the
case of an intrusion to our process systems, interruptions to the Group’s operations. Aperam could be subject
to litigation, civil or criminal penalties, and adverse publicity - all of which could adversely affect its reputation,
financial condition and results of operations.

Risk of production equipment breakdown, risk of disruption of operations and supply chain,
risk of pandemic virus

Stainless steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical steelmaking equipment, such as furnaces,
continuous casters, rolling mills and electrical equipment (such as transformers). This equipment may incur
downtime as a result of unanticipated failures or other events, such as fires, severe climate events, explosions
or furnace breakdowns.

The risk of pandemic due to COVID-19 or other type of disease could also affect our employees and lead to
high absenteeism rate, up to fatalities in our production premises. While we have implemented strict health
and safety protocols, such pandemic may impact our production processes.

Aperam’s manufacturing plants have experienced, and may in the future experience, plant shutdowns or
periods of reduced production, disruption of operations and supply chain as a result of such process failures,
or other events such as natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, extreme weather events, and environmental
issues linked to climate change.

To the extent that lost production resulting from such a disruption cannot be compensated for by unaffected
facilities, the disruption could have an adverse effect on Aperam’s operations, customer service levels and
results of operations.
