ANNUAL REPORT 2016

1. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND

Almost 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and after the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, the global
economy seems to be on a track of ongoing low growth. Consequently, the IMF estimates that in 2016 the world
economy grew 3.1% vs. 3.2% in 2015, (World Economic Outlook, IMF, January 2017), performing differently according
to the geographic areas.

In Europe, the economy experienced moderate growth, with positive signs, though facing challenges posed by political
events, in particular the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union after the referendum. After increase of
2% in GDP in 2015 in the Euro Zone, growth slowed down in 2016 (1.7% according to the latest IMF estimates), followed
by a drop in the unemployment rate.

According to the same source, Germany, the engine of the European economy, grew slightly more compared to the
previous year, estimated at 1.7%. Positive economic data for the fourth quarter point to economic growth in the Euro
Zone at the quickest pace since 2011. However, the progress of the European economy will continue to depend greatly
on the political events in 2017, including the elections that will be held in several countries. The ECB has continued its
policy of quantitative easing, having lowered its policy rates again in March 2016.

In 2016, the rate of economic growth in North America slowed down (2.6% in 2015 vs. 1.6% estimated for 2016, World
Economic Outlook, IMF, January 2017). On the other hand, the Federal Reserve raised its reference rate, albeit only
slightly compared with what was expected, taking into account the economic performance in the year and the
management of future expectations of the market. A better performance was recorded in the second half of the year;
the markets reacted positively to the election of Donald Trump, whose office raises uncertainties for both the American
and global economies, e.g. possible implementation of strong protectionist measures.

China's growth rate continued to slow down, with less exports and imports, partly based on less investment and
industrial activity, nonetheless at significantly high level and playing a proportionally decisive part in overall growth. The
performance of the Chinese economy is reflected particularly in the commodities market (except for oil), with China as
one of the core players, whose prices fell significantly across the board.

In particular, the price of oil doubled in 2016, standing at USD 56 year end. The meetings held between OPEP and the
non-member countries resulted in output limitation, and at the end of the year it was agreed that production in OPEP
countries and Russia would be reduced.

Regarding the exchange market, in 2016 the dollar appreciated against the euro and other main market currencies, and
continued to function as a safe currency. The North American currency is not expected to depreciate, whereas the
currencies of countries that depend on US policies and economy may encounter difficulties.

After a 1.5% growth in GDP in 2015, the Portuguese economy is expected to grow 1.2% in 2016 (Bank of Portugal —
Projections for the Portuguese economy: 2016-2019). So the Portuguese economy has followed a path of moderate
recovery since 2013 sustained by dynamic exports; it recovered access to markets in the aftermath of the sovereign
debt crisis, and the level of unemployment, while high, has been decreasing sustainably. However, economic growth
still faces several constraints, namely the high level of debt, high long-term unemployment rate, low volume of
investment and vulnerable banking and financial sectors.

Turnover in the paper and pulp business area in 2016 stood at 1,577.4 million euros, approximately 3.1% below the
previous year's figure. The decrease arises mainly from less energy sales, after the sales price to the grid from the
natural gas co-generation plant in Figueira da Foz were reviewed and overall paper and pulp prices fell in 2016.

CEMENT!: 470.5 MILLION EUROS Y 1.3%

In 2016, the cement unit recorded turnover of 470.5 million euros, 1.3% below that recorded in the previous financial
year. The drop was mostly due to fall in turnover of all operations conducted in Portugal and Tunisia, while turnover
in Brazil grew.

ENVIRONMENT: 26.7 MILLION EUROS Vv 3.3%

The environmental area recorded turnover of approximately 26.7 million euros in 2016, down by around 3.3% against
2015.

EBITDA

EBITDA for 2016 increased by approximately 2.3% in relation to the previous year, standing at 489.1 million euros. The
consolidated EBITDA margin stood at 23.6%, 1.2 p.p. higher than that in the previous year.

PAPER AND PULP: 397.4 MILLION EUROS #N 1.9%

EBITDA in the Paper and Pulp business area in 2016 stood at 397.4 million euros, which represents an increase of 1.9%
in relation to the previous year. The EBITDA margin stood at 25.2% in 2016, 1.2 p.p. up from the previous year. The
progress reflects the effect of the effort of cost reduction.

CEMENT: 85.1 MILLION EUROS Vv 0.3%

EBITDA in the cement business area stood at 85.1 million euros, which translated into a decrease of 0.3% in relation to
2015. EBITDA decreased essentially as a result of operations in Portugal, where this indicator decreased 2.6 million
euros, and in Lebanon, where it also dropped 2.6 million euros. In 2016, the EBITDA margin stood at 18.1%, 0.2 p.p. up
from that recorded in the previous year.

ENVIRONMENT: 6.9 MILLION EUROS Vv 14.7%

The EBITDA of the environmental area recorded in 2016 approximately 6.9 million euros, which represented a drop of
around 14.7% against 2015, but an increase of 78.9% compared to 2014. The EBITDA margin stood at 25.8%, down by
around 3.4 p.p. over the margin in 2015.

Ho.pincs (SEMAPA SGPS AND INSTRUMENTAL SUB-HOLDINGS) #8 93.2%

In 2016, EBITDA of the holdings amounted to -0.4 million euros, comparing favourably with the negative amount of 5.3
million euros in the previous year. Note that in the same period in 2015, EBITDA had been negatively impacted by the
reclassification of balance sheet gratuities referred to 2014, paid after the decision adopted at the Annual General
Meeting in 2015, for personnel costs by virtue of the accounting standards in force.

NET INCOME

Net income totalled 114.9 million euros, up by 40.9% over the previous year. The increase in the EBITDA, improved
financial results and income tax comparing favourably, more than offset the effects of increase of depreciation,
impairment losses and provisions and the decrease in Navigator's stake after July 2015.

3.2. OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS OF THE PAPER AND PAPER PULP AREA

In 2016, the turnover of Navigator stood at 1,577.4 million euros, compared to 1,628.0 million euros in the previous
year. The drop in total sales arises mainly from less energy sales, after the sales price to the grid from the natural gas
co-generation plant in Figueira da Foz were reviewed and overall paper and pulp prices fell in 2016. Navigator mitigated
the downward trend in paper and pulp prices by increasing its sales volumes, and also through an effort to reduce costs.

In Europe, conditions in the paper business (UWF) deteriorated during 2016, and estimates point to a reduction in
apparent consumption of 3.8% (-0.3% in 2015) and growth in total imports of more than 18%. Paper imports from Asia
grew significantly, particularly in office paper, having driven global prices down. In this adverse context, Navigator sales
of UWF paper stood at 1,586.8 thousand tons, a 2.0% increase compared to 2015, thus reaching a new peak in terms of
volume. The Group succeeded in placing additional volumes of paper in this context by increasing its sales both in Europe
and in International markets. In European sales, the average price was 1.2% lower than recorded in the previous year,
which compares with an increase in the price index for Europe (PIX A4 Copy-B) of 0.3%; this was due to a negative
change in the product group and geography sales mix. Navigator's average sales price for all markets was down by 2.4%
in relation to the previous year, also due to the change in product and market mix.

Falling pulp prices were a key feature of the previous year, in a descent which started in late 2015 and continued
throughout 2016. The benchmark index for hardwood pulp (PIX — BHKP) dropped by around 16% in USD and 13% in
Euros in relation to the start of 2016. However, Navigator had a sound operating performance, with volume of pulp
placed on the market amounting to 290.6 thousand tons, raising sales by 15.1% due to the capacity expansion at the

MANAGEMENT REPORT 10 OF 291

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Cacia mill in 2015, which has resulted in increased availability of pulp for the market. The increase in the sales volume
fell short of wholly offsetting the reduction in prices, and the value of pulp sales ended the year at around 1.6% below
the figure recorded in 2015.

In the energy business, Navigator suffered the impact of a series of negative factors over the course of the year, most
significantly the fact that, as anticipated, natural gas cogeneration at Figueira da Foz switched to an own-consumption
only basis, reducing the volume of power sales to the national grid, while reducing purchases of electricity and natural
gas for one of the paper mills. Operations were also constrained by repairs on the turbogenerators at the Cacia and
Setubal pulp mills, as well as other planned maintenance, in particular at the natural gas co-generation plant at the
Setubal industrial complex and at the Setubal biomass power station.

Asa result, total gross power output for the period as a whole was down by 8% on 2015 and the sales volume (quantity
of power sold in MWh) fell by 16.3%. The total value of power sales to the national grid stood at around 50 million euros
below the figure recorded in 2015. However, the reduction in the volume of electricity and gas purchases and lower
purchase prices for fuel, essentially natural gas, significantly softened the impact of the drop in power sales, resulting
in a net negative impact of around 6.0 million euros in EBITDA in relation to 2015.

In the tissue business unit, sales volume of goods and merchandise from the Vila Velha de Rddao plant grew
approximately 30% in 2016 (in tons sold), driven by the rise in output capacity of reels and product finishing in 2015.
The increase in amounts sold, together with the slight decrease in average sales price due to changes in the product mix
(greater sales of reels), resulted in tissue sales close to 67.5 million euros, rising by 21% over the previous year.

The EBITDA of Navigator for 2016 totalled 397.4 million euros, up from the figure of 390.0 million in the previous year,
reflecting a margin of 25.2%, compared to 24.0% recorded in 2015.

On the cost side, Navigator recorded an increase in the volume of wood supplied to mills, sourced essentially from the
Spanish and import market. Despite an improvement in specific consumption, increased use of imported wood pushed
up the overall acquisition cost. Imports from Spain and beyond continue to be necessary to make up for shortfalls in
supply on the Portuguese market.

As observed in the first nine months of 2016, logistical costs for paper and pulp were brought down due to falling oil
prices, different destination market mix, increased use of ports closer to the mills (Setubal and Figueira) and
improvements in cross-cutting procedures and greater efficiency in the Group's trade operations. These factors made
it possible to bring down logistical costs by 8.2 million euros in relation to the previous year.

In the case of chemicals used in paper manufacture, Navigator achieved a reduction in overall costs estimated at about
2 million euros. In addition, Navigator has been working hard to cut maintenance costs at all its industrial sites, resulting
in an overall reduction in 2016 of around 5%, corresponding to 3.6 million euros.

Personnel costs show a reduction of approximately 10.2 million euros against the previous year. On the one hand, in
2015 this item included non-recurrent costs, namely consisting of allocations to the pension fund, additional costs
relating to the rejuvenation programme under way and the estimated cost of the performance bonus. On the other
hand, expenses in 2016 were hit by growth in the workforce due to the recruitment by new businesses (in Mozambique
and the USA) and integration of services which were outsourced before, in particular at the Figueira da Foz mill.
Consequently, personnel costs in 2016 stayed in line with those in 2015, excluding the impact of the workforce in new
business areas and of insourcing, as well as other non-recurrent impacts which inflated costs in the previous year.

In addition to the operating performance described above, EBITDA in the period is also the result of several non-
recurrent elements, with an overall positive value of 7.5 million euros, namely:

* Revaluation of biological assets in Portugal, reflecting essentially the review of the assumptions underlying the
discount rate and a number of adjustments to the valuation model: net increase of 7.3 million euros;

MANAGEMENT REPORT 11 OF 291


--- Page 8 ---

5 Semapa

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

* Reversal of anti-dumping amount on the 2015 EBITDA: positive impact of 3.8 million euros;

* Receipt of compensation for breakdowns in TG3 and TG4 in Cacia in 2015 and 2016, less the estimated overall impact
of the breakdowns: positive impact of approximately 1 million euros;

* Impairment of biological assets in Mozambique: negative impact of 3.5 million euros;

* The impact of the fire at the tissue mill in Vila Velha de Rodao in May less the partial insurance receipt: negative
effect on EBITDA of 1.1 million euros;

Without these non-recurrent items, the figure for EBITDA in 2016 would have been broadly equivalent to that recorded
in 2015.

Operating income in 2015 amounted to 215.1 million euros, which compares with 267.6 million euros in 2015. This item
was hit by an increase of 45 million euros in Depreciation and impairments, reflecting essentially increased impairment
on tangible fixed assets in Mozambique associated with field works (45.5 million euros, on top of the 3.5 million euros
of biological assets in Manica), which reflect a conservative approach to the project, considering the country’s current
economic and political context. This item also includes the write-off of tangible fixed assets, following the fire in Vila
Velha de Rédao (1.9 million euros).

The financial results in 2015 amounted to negative 20.8 million euros, which compares favourably with a negative value
of 50.3 million euros in 2015. The Group recorded a reduction of 16.6 million euros in interest expense due to the
significant restructuring of its debt over the past twelve months and also positive trends in interest income and net
foreign exchange gains. The results also reflect the impact of non-recurrent items, in particular (i) a cost of 6 million
euros relating to the premium on the option exercised in May 2016 to repay 150 million euros for Portucel Senior Notes
5.375%, a cost nonetheless 8.6 million euros lower than the repayment premium recorded in September 2015 for
repayment of 200 million euros; (ii) a reversal of provisions for compensatory interest with a value of 3.2 million euros.

The account for taxes reflects a series of reversals of tax provisions in the final quarter of 2016, as a result of closure of
the tax inspection of Navigator in relation to the financial year of 2013 and favourable court decisions adding up to 23
million euros, and also the positive impact of adoption of the revaluation rules published in Decree-Law 66/2016, of 3
November, with a net effect of 16 million euros. In 2015 the account for taxes was impacted negatively by the tax gain
generated on disposal inside the group of assets allocated to pulp manufacture in Setubal (16 million euros).

The consolidated net income for the year stood at 206.4 million euros, representing growth of +11.4% in relation to the
same period in 2015.

3.3. BUSINESS REVIEW
3.3.1. PAPER

3.3.1.1. MARKET BACKGROUND

In 2016 the framework was adverse, as a result of the 3.8% decrease in apparent consumption of UWF in Europe and
an increase of around 18% of the volume of European low cost imports, particularly from countries affected by the anti-
dumping taxes imposed by the USA, like Indonesia and China. The negative effect of these two factors was offset by the
closing of total production capacity in Europe of 300.000 tons, which meant that the operating rate dropped only 1.4
p.p. against 2015, standing at 91%.

Paper market price, pressured by the drop in the price of pulp, remained at 2015 levels, on average, in spite of the
variation of 29.6 euro/t between the beginning and the end of the year. The main UWF benchmark price index (PIX A4-

MANAGEMENT REPORT 12 OF 291

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Copy B) increased 0.3% year on year.

In the USA, the drop in apparent consumption of UWF paper of 3.7% was in line with the European market. The
imposition of anti-dumping measures and the appreciation of the dollar brought the international flows down
significantly, imports decreasing by 12% and exports by 10.5%. The capacity utilization rate stood at 92% (-0.6 p.p. vis a
vis 2015). The leading price index for the sector (Risi 20Ib A4) fell by 1.9% in relation to the same period in the previous
year, in line with the trend since 2010.

Despite this environment, Navigator recorded in 2016 its highest ever figure for the volume of paper sales, up by more
than 2% on 2015. In addition to the 2.4% increase in sales in Europe, this growth was sustained by ongoing expansion
into new geographical regions, especially in the Middle East and Africa, and sales in markets outside Europe stood at
their highest ever level. This growth in countries outside Europe consisted largely of an increase in the volume of sales
of standard products, altering the share represented by these products in the total volume of paper sales and impacting
average sales price negatively. However, it is important to note that, because of the Group's positioning and foreign
exchange rate trends, these sales are more profitable than selling equivalent products in Europe. Despite the less
advantageous mix of products sold, the Group has maintained its position as leader in the premium segment, with a
market share of more than 50% in Europe.

As a result, the Group continued to operate, as usual, at 100% of its capacity, with order books at record levels.

3.3.1.3. BRANDING
In 2016 the Navigator Company Group continued to focus on its own brands, in particular the following:

The Navigator brand continued to lead the market in the premium office paper segment in 2016, especially sales in Eastern
Europe, the Nordic and Baltic countries and England, as well as Africa, thus expanding its geographical presence in over 110
countries worldwide.

For the first time, Navigator brand was number one on the Brand Equity Index, an initiative of Opticom. The 2016 survey
highlighted Navigator as the most popular, top selling brand, with the highest loyalty rate and quality perception index. The
annual EMGE — Paper Industry Consultants study conducted among wholesale professionals rated Navigator again as the
leading brand in Europe.

Discovery, European leader brand in low grammage office paper, continues to prove that it is possible to strike a balance
between environmental results and grammage reduction, thus ensuring high performance levels, by combining top raw
materials, innovation, state-of-the-art technology and a strong position at the level of eco-efficiency.

Discovery is today a world reference in its segment; it can be found in more than 60 countries, and in 2016 it continued
to grow in important markets, like the Italian, where sales increased by more than 5%.

In 2016, Pioneer, the premium office paper brand with the female universe as its target, consolidated its position in
terms of sales and market share, both in Europe and in other international markets, the performance in North Africa
standing out in particular.

The Pioneer brand also managed to be in the top-20 brands with more spontaneous knowledge in the annual study

Performance is concerned.

3.3.2. PULP

3.3.2.1. MARKET BACKGROUND

After a start to the year when Chinese buyers significantly scaled down their purchases of BEKP, demand for pulp picked
up, with gains of 5.7% (accrued) in 2016. The Chinese market has accounted for 98% of this increase. The global capacity

utilization rate for BEKP stood at 93% in 2016.

However, fears persist as to the impact of new production capacity expected to come on line in late 2016 and in the
next few years, and the industry's benchmark price, which started the year at a high level, followed a sharp downward
course, dropping around 16% in USD and 13% in EUR since the start of the year.

3.3.3. TISSUE

3.3.3.1. MARKET BACKGROUND

The Tissue market, one of Navigator's focus under the expansion plan, has evolved favourably in terms of apparent
consumption in Western Europe. In 2016 it is believed to have grown 2.2% compared to the previous year.

3.3.3.2. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

Sale of finished products &) 2 315.7%
Sale of reels and other goods 42 37 13.0%
Sale of tissue total 51 39 29.7%

In this context, considering the increase in capacity completed in 2015, Navigator presented accumulated growth of
29.7% in the volume of tissue sales (tons). This growth occurred in particular in the away-from-home segment, in
Portugal and Spain. Sales on the Portuguese market stood at around 43.5 million euros, accounting for 65% of total
volume. Practically all the Group's other tissue sales were to Spain, totalling approximately 23.2 million euros. Total
tissue sales in 2016 stood at 67.5 million euros, representing growth of approximately 21%.

3.4. INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

In 2016 1.5 million tons of air dry Paper Pulp and 1.6 million tons of UWF paper were produced, representing growth of
3.2% and 1.0% respectively, compared to the previous year. The production plants of Navigator were 100% occupied in
the year.

The Figueira da Foz plant achieved a new record in pulp production, 6,000 tAD more than the previous peak in 2015.

The expansion project implemented in 2015 at the Cacia plant resulted in more Pulp production at the unit in 2016, of
more than 45,000 tAD (13.2%).

Paper output at the two plants in Setubal increased again, 14,000 t more finished product than in the previous year,
with particular focus on the new industrial unit About the Future.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

The unit costs for wood, the main input cost of pulp, behaved favourably on 2015, down by 1.0 %.

In paper production, the variable unit costs dropped significantly on the previous year: 15.6% less in Fibres and Calcium
Carbonate overall, 2.3% less in Chemicals and 14.3% less in Electricity.

The maintenance costs of Navigator's industrial assets decreased 5.1% vis-a-vis 2015. The unit costs of maintaining the
Paper Plants remained at the same level, while these costs in the Pulp Plants dropped significantly by 11.4%, as a result
of less spending and a greater volume of pulp production.

Under the expansion policy for the production capacities of the Navigator plants, 2016 involved the preparatory
engineering work and negotiations with the suppliers of the industrial equipment for the project PO3 (Optimisation
Project 3), which is intended for enhancing the capacity of the Pulp Plant in Figueira da Foz to 650,000 tAD/year.

In Figueira da Foz, building started on the infrastructure designed to house a new pile of wood chips with a 170.000 m?
capacity and due to come into use in May 2017.

To improve the operational efficiency of the Navigator Pulp and UWF Paper plants, two pilot projects of Lean
Manufacturing will be implemented, one at the Figueira da Foz Pulp Plant and another at the About the Future Paper
Plant in Setubal. These experiments are intended to help draw the necessary lessons for expanding the Lean
methodology to all of the Navigator Plants. Also in this regard, the 5S+Safety methodology was consolidated throughout
the industrial area, having visibly impacted a cultural change oriented towards the Safety of People, greater operational
efficiency and, consequently, waste reduction.

Regarding tissue production in 2016, Vila Velha de Réddo reached 46,940 tons of paper and 41,700 tons of finished
goods in total, which translate an increase of 44% and 18%, respectively, against 2015.

2016 was a good year in terms of asset use: 86% of paper machines (figure affected negatively by the fire in May,
otherwise offset by an excellent internal response plan) and 77% of processing.

Furthermore, unit costs performed well, due to a nominal reduction on 2015 in all of the main items, mostly arising
from the scaling up of operations and the cost reduction activities.

The core equipment set up at Colombo Energy was concluded in 2016.
In the second half of 2016, the facilities, startup and entry into service tests were commissioned.

The production of industrial grade Pellets began in Q4, alongside product quality testing, and the first shipment left the
Port of Willmington, NC to the end customer.

Colombo Energy, with annual production capacity of 500 thousand tons of industrial and domestic grade Pellets, is
located in Greenwood, in the state of South Carolina, in the centre of one of the greatest forests on the East Coast of
the USA, guaranteeing a supply of wood in exceptional conditions.

3.5. DEVELOPMENT

Over the course of 2016, the Navigator Group pressed ahead with developing the various growth opportunities set out
in its strategic plan. Investment totalled 138.6 million euros, including 38 million euros in pulp, paper and tissue
business, 8.9 million euros in the project in Mozambique, and 81.6 million euros in the pellets mill in the United States.

PELLETS

Colombo Energy Inc., in South Carolina, USA, commenced operations in the last quarter of the year and has begun to
export to Europe. The output points to premium quality, high calorific value, low ash content and good durability.

MANAGEMENT REPORT 16 OF 291

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

The company has obtained certification by SFI, PEFC (CoC), FSC (CoC) and SBP, for the industrial segment, and
certification by PFI as needed to sell to the residential market in the USA.

Colombo Energy Inc. has secured sales to the industrial segment in Europe, representing 40% of the mill's capacity over
the next ten years. In addition, the market research into the residential segment in the US is pressing ahead, aimed at
channelling 10 to 20% of the output into the American domestic market.

MOZAMBIQUE

As referred previously, the Group has been monitoring carefully the economic and political developments occurring in
Mozambique, permanently reassessing the situation, and has decided to scale down the rhythm of investment in its
operations.

Indeed, 2016 was a year marked by political and economic instability, resulting in restrictions on travel and safety for
employees and service providers involved in the venture.

Nonetheless, the resulting operations point to the planting of around 5.3 thousand ha, bringing the total planted area
to date up to approximately 10 thousand ha in Zambezia and 1.7 thousand ha in Manica. In terms of plant supply, the
vast majority of the area planted was supplied from the nurseries in Lua, and a total of 7.1 million plants produced in
the year were used.

The year was also marked by the completion of important activities under the environmental and social actions plan
that was part of the commitment to the IFC - International Finance Corporation, which acquired a stake in the capital in
July.

A pilot project involving the export of 2 thousand tons of eucalyptus wood from the Port of Nacala was conducted,
aiming at acquiring insight into the legal and administrative procedures, logistics and operational channels of
institutions.

TISSUE

In late 2015, the Group announced its intention of implementing a development project in the tissue segment in Cacia,
consisting of the construction of a production line for tissue paper and the respective converting facilities. The project
would create nominal annual capacity of 70 thousand tons and involve total investment of 121 million euros. The
decision to go ahead with construction of the new line was conditional on a series of factors, in particular on the
company securing a package of fiscal and financial incentives, which has now been finalized.

Navigator estimates that the necessary conditions have been met for implementing this investment plan and, once the
incentives were contracted, the Board of Directors pressed ahead with the project. The new production and converting
lines for tissue are expected to be completed in the second half of 2018, and the capital disbursements are planned to
be split between 2017 (approximately 40%) and 2018.

EXPANSION OF PULP CAPACITY

Navigator also intends to develop a project to improve competitiveness at the Figueira da Foz Industrial Complex,
involving a total investment estimated at 85 million euros. The Group has submitted applications for a series of financial
and tax incentives, still pending decision from AICEP and expecting additional visibility at the end of the first quarter.
This project aims to improve production efficiency and to increase the annual capacity by 70 thousand tons, to a total
of 650 thousand tons of BEKP pulp.

However, Navigator is concerned at the Government's intention to approve new legislation for the forestry sector which
prohibits the planting of new areas with eucalyptus, permitting plantations in new areas only on the basis of swaps with
existing plantations in marginal and low-yield areas. This proposal, which lacks any technical or environmental rationale,
fails to take into account the importance of eucalyptus to the Portuguese economy and will add to the difficulties

MANAGEMENT REPORT 17 OF 291

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

experienced in a sector where supply and demand are already mismatched, and which already has to rely on imports of
wood costing approximately 200 million euros each year.

It is important to enhance, that the Group has been working in a constructive manner, both individually and through
the pulp and paper industry association, in order to deliver the necessary inputs to reduce the impact of the more
negative aspects of this legislation.

3.6. RESOURCES AND SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS

3.6.1. SUSTAINABILITY

In 2016, Navigator consolidated, in a structured and lasting fashion, its Sustainable practices. In economic terms, it
fostered employment and the development of the country and the regions; environmentally, through the fine-tuning
of policies and practices for the preservation of the environment and minimisation of the impacts of its activities; at the
social level, by creating opportunities for the development and well-being of its employees and the Community.

The Company delivered two sessions at the Sustainability Forum, providing a platform for dialogue and cooperation
with the main stakeholders. The event had more than 200 participants and addressed topics like the contribution of the
Navigator Group to the economic and social development of the country and the regions around its production units,
and forest certification as the pillar of an industry based on forest products coming from sustainably managed
plantations.

The investment project in Mozambique completed successfully the first year of the Social Development Plan, which
included several family and community-support initiatives.

In the context of its external activities, in 2016 Navigator was co-Chairman of the Forest Solutions Group, a global
platform of strategic cooperation for promoting sustainable forest management, under the WBCSD - World Business
Council for Sustainable Development.

Domestically, the Navigator Group remained actively present in the BCSD Portugal, lending support to the project MEET
2030 for the development of corporate scenarios and solutions for 2030 against the backdrop of climate change and
carbon neutrality.

Internally Navigator conducted a training module on sustainability for more than 800 of the company's operational staff.
The activity aimed at raising awareness to the importance of social and environmental challenges that the World faces,
while highlighting Navigator's sustainable management.

It published the 2014-2015 Sustainability Report based on the G4 version of the GRI - Global Reporting Initiative.
Stakeholders were also heard for their opinions on the relevant issues for the business, and the core challenges and
actions to be implemented for sustainability.

It is also worth highlighting that Navigator is among the top 3 companies with the Best Sustainability Performance in
2016 as assessed by Lyreco, a key customer of Navigator for the office paper business.

Navigator's core sustainability challenges include aligning its priorities with the UN's objectives on sustainable
development, involving business partners in the effort of integrating sustainable practice along the value chain,
reinforcing social responsibility and citizenship practices in the community, promoting staff participation, and sustaining
investment in circular economy and low carbon technologies.

3.6.2. FORESTRY AND TIMBER SUPPLY

SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT

Sustainable forest management is one of the fundamental pillars of Navigator's business model. In 2016, the company
developed its active policy of renewing Portugal's woodlands and increasing the returns obtained from own forest land
and rented properties, over a total area of 118 thousand hectares, in 168 municipalities and 603 parishes in the country;
55% of the forest is on property owned by the company.

In 2016 Navigator also produced cork (14 th. arrobas), wine (109 th. litres), resinous wood (28 th. tons), pinecones,
eucalyptus branch, game and pasture, among others, as a result of its diversified activity.

Forestation activity levels in 2016 were lower than in 2015, due to issues with the approval of the forestation projects
by the ICNF (Forest and Nature Conservation Institute) on time to authorise planting in the right weather conditions.
Therefore, a total of 1,8 thousand hectares were forested or reforested and 2 million selected eucalyptus saplings were
planted out.

With a focus on its responsible management of forest holdings, over 12.6 thousand hectares were controlled for
spontaneous vegetation and around 7 thousand hectares of stem cuttings selected. Fertilisation measures were also
conducted on approximately 8 thousand hectares and around 4,900 km of tracks and paths were maintained or
improved.

In 2016, approximately 607 thousand m? of eucalyptus timber was extracted from forests belonging to Navigator and
shipped (99% of which was certified wood).

The regular production of nursery plants in three nurseries of Viveiros Alianga, S.A. yielded production and sales of 8.9
million plants, of which 408 thousand were native or protected species and 84 thousand were ornamental plants or
shrubs.

In 2016, investment in fire prevention amounted to around 3 million euros, with emphasis being placed on prevention,
mitigation measures and Research & Development.

Assuming forest certification as a means to enhance its presence in the increasingly demanding international market
regarding the origin of the raw materials of its products and to respond to society's legitimate worries, in 2016 Navigator
managed to secure its certificates under two internationally acknowledged programmes, the FSC® and the PEFC™.
These certificates cover products like eucalyptus wood for paper and pulp production (Navigator's main output) and
cork. Navigator's certified area includes all holdings on mainland Portugal and corresponds to a significant share of all
certified Portuguese forests (32% FSC and 46% PEFC).

TIMBER SUPPLY

Wood supply in 2016 grew 156 thousand m? compared with 2015, arising from higher levels of consumption by plants.
Since the supply of eucalyptus wood on the Portuguese market fell short of the consumption needs, wood was imported,
especially from the Spanish market that contributed the most to the rise in supply (+33%), reflecting an increase in the
cost of production when compared to 2015.

Therefore, supply amounted to 4.5 million m?, 72% of which from Portugal, including self-supply, 14% from Spain and
14% from outside the Iberian market: Uruguay and Brazil. Navigator has maintained its position as a strong player in the
Atlantic woodchip market.

Of all timber supplied to the plants, 45% was certified and 55% was of protected origin. In Spain, where the supply of
certified wood is strong, 88% of the timber supplied was certified. Navigator enhanced its focus on promoting forest
certification measures and of the Custody Chain with suppliers and owners' associations, aiming at achieving 20% of all
national purchase of certified timber in 2017.

3.6.3. ENERGY
The electricity generated by Navigator accounts for approximately 4% of annual gross production on mainland Portugal.
In 2016 Navigator produced 2,114 GWh in total, 7.7% less than in the previous year.

Electric power production was impacted mostly by two factors: On the one hand, malfunction of the turbogenerators
at the Cacia and Setubal mills; on the other hand, the fact that from November 2015, the combined-cycle natural gas
power station in Figueira da Foz switched to an own-consumption only basis using one turbogroup only.

In 2016, Electricity generated by biomass power plants totalled 1.235 GWh, amounting to approximately 59% of
Navigator's total production and around 50% of the estimated total national production from this renewable resource.
Four renewable cogeneration plants fuelled by biomass and the two thermoelectrical stations fuelled by biomass in
Cacia and Setubal contributed to the output.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Compared to 2015, Electricity generated by biomass power plants increased 1.5%, benefiting from a more favourable
production framework for renewable cogeneration. It is important to highlight the role of cogeneration technology that,
by optimising simultaneous production of electric and thermal power, helps save significant amounts of primary energy,
compared to producing the same amount of power using separate equipment.

On the other hand, the electric power produced by the two combined-cycle natural gas power stations in Setubal and
Figueira da Foz accounted for approximately 41% of Navigator's total production in 2016. The production of electric
power by natural gas power stations decreased around 18% compared to 2015, in virtue of the combined-cycle natural
gas power station in Figueira da Foz being switched to an own-consumption basis using one turbogroup only.

In 2016, the solar power facility of Navigator began operating, signalling the Group's focus on one of the world's
emerging sources of renewable energy. With 2,288 kWp of installed power, the solar power facility will support the
production of around 3,100 MWh/year of renewable electric power supplied to paper machine 4 on own-consumption
only basis.

The increase in power generation from renewable sources, reducing where possible the exposure to fossil fuels remains
an important goal of Navigator's activity in the field of energy.

FOREST BIOMASS FOR ENERGY PURPOSES

The year 2016 maintained high biomass supply, particularly leftovers from the forest activities. The biomass power
stations of Cacia and Setubal were supplied with approximately 314 thousand tons of biomass, not including bark of
eucalyptus from the plants.

3.6.4. ENVIRONMENT

The environmental performance of Navigator is still very much guided by ongoing improvement, taking into account
technological development and the implementation of best practices. It is in this context that in 2016 the activities
under the Environmental Strategic Plan of Navigator were first implemented, and will continue until 2026.

Following a year of intense environmental investment in the Cacia Industrial Complex, in 2016 a new Optimisation
Project (PO3) with a strong environmental focus was started at the Figueira da Foz unit. The project seeks to address
the implementation of the Best Available Techniques (BAT) and the Emission Levels Associated to the BAT (ELA-BAT),
laid down in Commission Decision 2014/687/EU of 26 September.

The environmental indicators for 2016 illustrate the good performance that all industrial units have kept up with in all
areas: air, water, waste, power and materials. Compared to 2015, atmospheric emissions of particles and NOx improved,
while SO2 emissions increased. The latter will be significantly reduced after the implementation of the PO3 project.

Improvements in procedures and the minimisation of loss helped to reduce total waste per ton of product by 47%
compared to 2010. The waste recovery rate in the last decade remained above 80%.

The odour emission study conducted on all of Navigator's Industrial units, in partnership with accredited external
entities, will help to minimise this important environmental feature by outlining improvement/mitigation measures.

3.6.5. INNOVATION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Group is known for focusing on the development of innovative products, not only in terms of intrinsic quality, but
also of consumer segmentation, which continued to receive particular attention in 2016.

In 2016, the Group continued to invest in research in forestry, pulp and paper, through the work of its forestry and
paper research institute, RAIZ, conducted in close cooperation with the Group's respective business sectors and a range
of bodies in the national and international science and technology sector.

4.3. OVERVIEW OF THE CEMENT AND DERIVATIVES BUSINESS AREA

In 2016, the cement unit recorded turnover of 470.5 million euros, 1.3% below that recorded in the previous year. The
drop was mostly due to fall in turnover of all operations conducted in Portugal and Tunisia, while turnover in Brazil grew.

EBITDA stood at 85.1 million euros, which translated into a decrease of around 0.3 million euros in relation to 2015.
EBITDA decreased essentially as a result of operations in Portugal, where this indicator decreased 2.6 million euros, and
in Lebanon, where it also dropped 2.6 million euros. In 2016, the EBITDA margin stood at 18.1%, 0.2 p.p. up from that
recorded in the previous year.

Operating income stood at 26.1 million euros, up from 23.4 million euros in the previous year as a result of the improved
provisions.

The financial results experienced a positive a development, having increased from a negative figure of 41.7 million euros
in 2015 to minus 37.2 million euros in 2016. In spite of the integration of the Supremo Group with high financing costs
(due to the investment made in the new Adriandpolis plant and the high interest rates charged in Brazil), these results
were less negative, especially as a result of exchange rate appreciation of around 4 million euros.

4.4. BUSINESS REVIEW
4.4.1. PORTUGAL

4.4.1.1. MARKET BACKGROUND

The projections for Portugal in 2016-2019 suggest continued moderate growth of the economic activity, slightly below
projections for the Euro Zone. After a 1.5% growth in GDP in 2015, a 1.2% rise is seen for 2016 (Bank of Portugal —
Projections for the Portuguese economy: 2016-2019). The Construction Production Index (INE — Indices of Production,
Employment and Remuneration in Construction —- November 2016) was down by 2% in November 2016, on a year on
year basis.

According to the latest figures available, cement consumption in mainland Portugal was down by 3.6% year on year. It
is estimated that the market reached approximately 2.7 million tons.

According to the latest figures available, cement consumption in mainland Portugal was down by 3.6% year on year. It
is estimated that the market reached approximately 2.7 million tons. Although the performance picked up in the second
half of the year, the improvement was not enough to make up for the low consumption at the beginning of the year.
The figures were brought down mostly by the public works sector.

2016

In the Cement business in Portugal, including sales in Portugal and exports, although the amounts sold in the domestic
market increased 4.4% in relation to figures in 2015, the quantities sold for export dropped around 21.6% year on year.
Consequently, the turnover of the whole unit dropped 8.2%, resulting in 142.2 million euros in 2016. This was mostly
the result of the negative developments of cement and clinker exports, due to excess supply in the Mediterranean and
less demand in countries dependent on revenues from fossil fuels, namely Algeria.

The Cement business unit in Portugal recorded EBITDA of 28.3 million euros, slightly down on the figure recorded in
2015. The drop in activity was partially offset by CO: sales licenses (2016 recorded 3.6 million euros of gains, whereas
in the previous year sales amounted to 1.6 million euros) and the decrease in production costs, as thermal energy costs
dropped significantly, influenced positively by overall reduction in fuel prices. The optimization of the alternative fuel
mix helped improve the fossil fuel replacement rate.

The turnover of the Ready-mix concrete business unit totalled 46.0 million euros in 2016, which dropped 28.5% in
comparison with 2015, resulting from less amounts sold once the Mardo Tunnel project was completed. The Mardo
tunnel aside, although sales in the first quarter of 2016 decreased year on year (due to weather conditions), in the
following quarters they picked up, which brought sales in 2016 up by approximately 4% against 2015.

EBITDA of this business unit stood at a loss of around 0.6 million euros, against 3.3 million euros in the previous year.
The EBITDA was brought down by the decrease in turnover and the increase in transportation costs.

4.4.2, LEBANON

4.4.2.1. MARKET BACKGROUND

Lebanon is still feeling the impact of the global slowdown and regional instability, especially with the situation in Syria.
The political environment remained relatively unstable in 2016, notwithstanding the new elected president and a new
government in place at the end of the year. Nonetheless, there are expectations of modest economic growth. According
to the latest figures published by the IMF, the Lebanese economy is expected to grow by 1% in 2016, as was the case in
2015 (World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2016).

Regarding cement consumption in 2016, the market grew 4.3% against 2015, standing at 5.3 million tons. This happened
because weather conditions were more favourable than in 2015 (weather conditions in the first quarter of 2015 were
rather adverse) and the completion of some projects that continued from 2015. However, consumption dropped in the
fourth quarter of 2016.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Lebanon in 2016 and 2015:

The sales of Cement and Clinker totalled 1,116 thousand tons, down by 1.6% year on year. The competitive nature of
the market has been challenging, reflecting a 2.6% fall of average prices in local currency. Turnover dropped by
approximately 0.3%, totalling 87.8 million euros.

The Cement unit recorded EBITDA of 32.6 million euros, down by 6.2% over the figure recorded in 2015. The drop
resulted from a decrease in the amounts sold, enhanced competitiveness, the pressure on sales prices and the need to
purchase cement from third parties for sale, partly offset by lower input costs.

INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

Clinker production was below production in 2015, with 871 thousand tons produced (vs. 1,007 thousand tons in 2015).
Production was down due to the programmed shut down of line 2 in Q1 to fit in the bag filter. Due to some constraints
in cement production (shut downs of the main cement mill), less cement was produced compared to 2015, having
produced 1,103 thousand tons (vs. 1,162 thousand tons of cement in 2015).

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Investments in 2016 amounted to 3.4 million euros; the installation of the bag filter on line 2 (initiated at the end of
2015 and involving investment of 1.3 million euros in 2016) was completed and the raw material silo was modified (420
thousand euros).

Therefore, EBITDA of this unit stood at 65 thousand euros, representing a drop of 87.5% in relation to 2015. The figure
was brought down by the decrease in turnover, which was partly offset by lower maintenance and fuel expenses, and
the recording of impairments on customers.

4.4.3. TUNISIA

4.4.3.1. MARKET BACKGROUND

In Tunisia, after the end of the process of political transition, the economic transformation required to ensure sustained
growth remains to be concluded. According to the latest figures published by the IMF, the Tunisian economy is expected
to have grown by 1.5% in 2016, above the 0.8% figure recorded in 2015 (World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2016).

The climate of uncertainty impacted cement consumption, which dropped about 4% in 2016, compared to 2015.
Competition in the Tunisian market has grown, with many competitors and strong pressure on sales prices, which
dropped. The competition was also felt in exports, aggravated by the occasional shut down of the Libyan borders and
the constraints of cement exports from Tunisia to Algeria.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Tunisia in 2016 and 2015:

Sales performance of the Cement and Clinker segment dropped in comparison with 2015, and sales volume decreased
15.5%. Domestic market sales were down by 6.2%, as a result of a reduction in the market and pressure on the sales
price. In spite of strong competition, unit prices grew approximately 1.7% in the domestic market against 2015, partly
due to the product mix.

Sales for export were also down by 43.2% on 2015. The reduction is due to some limitations to imports in Algeria and
the closure of the Libyan border several times. Export sales prices are down due to the aforementioned constraints and
greater competition (as a result of the situation in the domestic market), which also hindered the sales of this unit.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

EBITDA in 2016 stood at around 10.5 million euros, down by about 6.3% compared to the previous year.

Production performed better in 2016 than in 2015. The variable costs of clinker and cement production decreased in
relation to the same period of the previous year. Decrease in thermal energy costs, as a result of overall drop in fuel
prices impacted the reduction in production costs significantly. Electricity costs also decreased, as a result of less specific
consumptions and energy price. The price of electric power in Tunisia reduced significantly in June, which also impacted
quite positively input costs in the third and fourth quarter.

INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS
Less clinker was produced in 2016 than in 2015, due to the reduction in cement output, arising from the drop in cement

sales.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Investment amounted to 2.2 million euros, the equivalent to 2015, mainly intended for investments in replacement,

approximately 500 thousand euros.

EBITDA of this business unit stood at 29 thousand euros, lower than the figure for the same period of the previous year,
as a result of the drop in the EBITDA margin due to the rise in the purchase price of some raw materials, transportation

costs and the recording of some impairments on customers.

4.4.4.1, MARKET BACKGROUND

In Brazil, recent IMF projections point to a contraction of the economy of 3.5% in 2016 (World Economic Outlook, IMF,

October 2016).

The economy of Brazil is still significantly affected by the political instability, tax adjustments and a number of
proceedings/inquiries which received plenty of media coverage. The combination of these events produced a great deal
of uncertainty about which way the economy would go, making expectations difficult to manage.

In this context, the construction industry was naturally affected: less works and projects, with an impact on cement
consumption. Recent information (SNIC — January 2017) about the cement market in Brazil suggest a drop in the market
in the first half of 2016 of around 11.7% year on year. In the south of Brazil, the core market of the Supremo Group, the
decrease amounted to 5.8%.

? The integration of the Supremo Group in the Semapa consolidated financial statements for 2015, taking into account that the acquisition of the remaining
50% of the Group, which forced the full consolidation, occurred at the end of the month of June, and had the following impact: 50% of the results of the first
half were integrated using the equity method, the balance sheet position was fully consolidated (100%) with reference to 30 June 2015 and the results in the
second half (July to December) were also fully consolidated (100%).

In 2016, total operations by the Supremo Group generated turnover of 77.6 million euros, of which 64.9 million euros
from cement and clinker and 12.7 million euros from ready-mixed concrete. It should be noted that the Adriandpolis
plant began production only in late April 2015 and, consequently, the average daily sales volume increased. In 2016,
while the market slowed down, the unit managed to raise sales significantly, having sold 1,132 thousand tons of cement
and clinker and 216.3 thousand m?of ready-mixed concrete.

Although the start-up of the new plant was successful, sales prices behaved rather negatively in 2016, under the strong
impact of competition. The market contraction, combined with the increase in the capacity of one of the competitors,
lead to increased competition, causing prices to drop. Average sales price dropped about 8% on 2015, which naturally
affected EBITDA margin.

In 2016, EBITDA stood at 6.4 million euros, compared to a negative figure of 1.4 million euros in the previous year. When
the Adriandpolis plant went into operation, variable input costs decreased significantly, due to less thermal and electric
consumption by the new equipment. The variable costs of cement production were down (although they are not directly
comparable with the previous year, as there are a new range of products), as a result of the reduction in the cost of fuel
purchased and the cost control activities. The fixed costs increased compared with costs in 2015, due to growing
operations in Brazil, arising from reinforcement of the sales team, the opening of new distribution centres and fixed
costs concerning a new industrial unit.

INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

The levels of clinker and cement production in Brazil were significantly higher in 2016 than in 2015. The new plant began
operating in April 2015, which is why the figures cannot be compared, as 2016 was the first complete year of activity of
the new plant. The Adriandpolis plant showed good industrial performance, energy consumption (thermal and electric)
was less than in the previous year, which also helped to maintain variable costs down.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Investments in 2016 stood at 4.9 million euros, and included the completion of the plant construction, the purchase of
two concrete plants (intended to expand the cement sales channels), the opening of eight cement distribution centres
and the strategic centre in Curitiba.

4.4.5. ANGOLA

4.4.5.1. MARKET BACKGROUND

According to the IMF, the Angolan economy is not expected to grow in 2016 (World Economic Outlook, IMF October
2016). Given the heavy dependence of the economy on the revenues from the oil sector, this situation is limiting its
economic performance and making its presence felt in the major economic and financial variables. In 2016 the value of
the Kwanza continued to deteriorate, inflation was up (to around 33.7% according to the IMF) and the country faced
difficulties in foreign payments.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Angola in 2016 and 2015:

Angola Turnover EBITDA Quantities Sold

Total 19.1 24.2 -20.8% 24 14 72.1%

4.4.5.2. CEMENT AND CLINKER

The cement market in Angola was not immune to these difficulties and in 2016 it dropped around 25.5%, standing at
approximately 3.9 million tons. The decrease was justified by the halt in a great many public works, and by the private
building sector that was adversely affected by the overall rise in the prices of goods intended for current consumption.

This situation disturbed national cement manufacturers, who were impacted by the cost of clinker imports and all
incoming materials and services that was raised by currency depreciation. The availability of foreign exchange reduced,
creating difficulties in foreign payments and exposing companies to exchange losses.

The amount of cement sold decreased 22.6% in relation to the same period of the previous year, amounting to 154.7
thousand tons of cement sold. This decrease was due to market contraction, considering the aforementioned conditions
of the Angolan economy. Turnover amounted to 19.1 million euros in total, down by 20.8% compared to 2015. The
decrease was negatively affected by the depreciation of the Kwanza against the Euro by 6.9 million euros. The exchange
rate effect aside, the turnover would have been 5.7% more than in 2015, as the sales price increased significantly
(+44.8%), thus offsetting the drop in quantities.

MANAGEMENT REPORT 34 OF 291

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

The Group has done its best to reduce total costs through adjustments to its manufacturing structure. The fixed costs
dropped, due to staff costs that decreased as a result of workforce cuts. Such improvement helped to offset the rise in
variable unit costs due to: i) higher clinker import cost (arising from the devaluation of the Kwanza); and ii) significantly
higher energy and fuel costs.

The combined effect of the factors previously mentioned resulted in the EBITDA improvement, which reached 2.4
million euros in 2016, compared to 1.4 million euros in the previous year.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Investments in 2016 totalled 120 thousand euros (down by 82% against 2015), due to no relevant investments having
been made.

4.5. RESOURCES AND SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS

4.5.1. SUSTAINABILITY

Sustainability is a strategic issue for the management of the Secil Group, which is why it is committed to participate in
the CSI — Cement Sustainability Initiative, under the WBCSD — World Business Council for Sustainable Development,
namely through the measures for redesigning the priority goals and establishing the most suitable structure for their
fulfilment, in the context of the rejuvenation of the CSI.

Furthermore, Secil's CEO participated in the drafting of and outspokenly supported the Low Carbon Partnership
Initiative for the cement industry, the WBCSD's input to the Paris Agreements.

The following steps have been taken in the cement business unit in Portugal:
e The alternative fuel substitution rate rose to 47%, allowing further substitution of fossil fuels;
e The rate of clinker incorporation in cement was 74.9%, slightly below 75.5% in 2015;

e Carbon emissions went down from 620 kg of CO, released per ton of cement products in 2015, to 601 kg of
CO, per ton of cement products in 2015, lower than the set target (629 kg of CO2 per ton of cement products),
reflecting the lower proportion of clinker incorporated in cement and the reduced specific emission factor at
the Secil-Outdo plant;

e Carbon emissions of all 3 plants remained below the licences granted by the Portuguese Government under
the NIMs — National Implementing Measures for Allocations 2013-2020.
4.5.2. ENVIRONMENT

The cement industry has proven its commitment by reducing carbon emissions. It was the first industry to deliver a
roadmap of progress towards the targets for a low carbon economy (Cement Technology Roadmap — Carbon emissions
reductions up to 2050), jointly published by the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) and the International Energy
Agency (IEA) in 2009.

In 2013, the European Cement Association (CEMBUREAU) published a roadmap of the European cement industry, titled
“The role of Cement in the 2050 Low Carbon Economy”.

Secil participated actively in the drafting of these two documents as member of the CSI and the CEMBUREAU.

MANAGEMENT REPORT 35 OF 291


--- Page 32 ---

5 Semapa

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

In the latter of the two documents mentioned above, the CEMBUREAU proposed to reduce CO2 emissions by 32%
compared to a 1990 baseline, using proven conventional technologies. Such reduction may increase to 80%, as soon as
ground breaking technologies, such as the Carbon Capture and Storage/Use (CCS/U), become technically and
economically viable.

In July 2015 the European Commission (CE) tabled a proposal to revise the Directive on the European Carbon Dioxide
Emissions Market (EU-ETS), which will have to be adopted in co-decision with the European Parliament and the
European Council.

The EU-ETS should be an incentive for investment, growth and the creation of jobs, allowing the cement industry and
the equivalent to foster innovative solutions in shaping the Europe of tomorrow. Therefore, the proposal submitted
should protect the more efficient facilities in the European market from competition by non-European manufacturers,
which are not subject to proportionate restrictions for reducing CO2 emissions, and foster competition between
European producers for exporting outside Europe. Consequently, it should ensure technically viable emission reduction
rates, while guaranteeing affordable energy prices.

However, the proposal of the EC does not provide for these two situations and, if it is not changed, it will burden the
more efficient facilities with undue costs, up to 30% of the Gross Value Added.

The EP and the European Council assessed the proposal in 2016; the EP adopted the changes on 15 February 2017 and
the Council adopted its changes at the European Council of Environment Ministers held on 28 February 2017. This will
be followed by a discussion between the three entities: the European Council, the European Parliament and the
European Commission. It is believed that EC is also available to discuss its details. Either individually or as a member of
the ATIC and CEMBUREAU, Secil undertakes to ensure that it is reviewed fairly and realistically by the relevant entities.

Nevertheless, we recall that under the Paris Agreements the negotiating conditions are expected to deteriorate further
for the sectors covered by the EU-ETS. We believe that a greater effort is needed to support those areas that are not
included, namely the carbon efficiency of buildings and infrastructures, to which the cement industry can contribute
significantly, by providing concrete construction solutions of proven sustainability.

4.6. ORGANISATION

Work continued in 2016 on prioritising procedure optimization and improvement. As in previous years, improved
efficiency remains one of the Group's main priorities and focal points in all geographical regions. The units continued to
implement several of previous years’ initiatives, and in 2016 a set of structural projects were laid out (some of which
cut across several regions), with the aim at all times to improve profitability and to streamline procedures.

5.3. OVERVIEW OF THE ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS AREA

The ETSA Group recorded turnover of 26.7 million euros in 2016, down by around 3.3% in comparison with the previous
year.

The reduction is the result of less 4.5% of consolidated services delivered, mostly due to the Government's decision to
cancel temporarily and exceptionally the official SIRCA collection from 26 August to 4 October, but also to the drop in
sales by around 2.4%, fundamentally arising from the price reduction.

This activity is cyclical. Therefore, EBITDA of the ETSA Group, which amounted to around 6.9 million euros in 2016, was
down by 14.7% against 2015, but up by 78.9% compared with 2014.

Such variation is explained cumulatively through: i) the suspension of the SIRCA service, and ii) narrower commercial
margins of sales, caused by lower meal prices and the rise in the cost of raw materials year on year.

The EBITDA margin stood at 25.8%, down by around 3.4 p.p. over the margin for the same period of 2015.

Financial results were up around 26.8% on the same period in the previous year, resulting from the average net debt in
the year, and the repricing of the applicable debt remuneration terms.

The combined impact of these factors resulted in Net Income attributable to equity holders of the ETSA Group for 2016
of approximately 3.0 million euros.

6. SEMAPA GROUP HUMAN RESOURCES

The Semapa Group’s human resource policy is geared to continuous improvement in productivity by developing
Workforce skills and expertise, in conjunction with streamlining and rationalization.

A commitment to a highly skilled workforce, with specialized professional careers, continues to be one of the key
features of the Group’s human resources policy, reflected in professional development and training activities and
programmes.

The Workforce of the Semapa Group went from 5,621 at the end of December 2015 to 6,028 at the end of December
2016, as shown in the following table:

31-12-2016 31-12-2015 Var.

Cement 2,615 2,647 -32
Environment 275 287 -12
Holdings 27 25 2

Total 6,028 5,621 407

The increase in the Paper and Paper Pulp areas is essentially the product of staff hired for the new businesses and the
incorporation of activities that were previously outsourced, particularly at the plant in Figueira da Foz.

7. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SEMAPA GROUP

Helping to sustainably develop its local communities is one of the strategic principles guiding the Semapa Group. The
Group has been aware at all times that sustainable growth depends on the well-being of its Workforce, and on the
support and ties it builds with the communities around its production units and commercial premises.

The Group is accordingly involved in a wide array of projects designed in the last instance to improve the quality of life
of the communities around its plants and facilities, and to preserve the environment.

Taken together, donations by the Semapa Group to welfare charities totalled approximately 2.2 million euros in 2016.

The following were some of the numerous initiatives and projects supported by the Group:

“Da a Mao a Floresta”: The 6th edition of this initiative , which is already an ex-libris of the annual agenda of
the CSR of Navigator, mobilised a total of 2,400 primary and pre-primary school children from north to south
of the country. This activity, that includes the celebrations of the World Forest Day and World Environment
Day, is conducted in partnership with the town halls and the local communities welcome it with open arms. It
is intended to raise the awareness of people to the need to protect and cherish the national forest. More than
5,000 plants were distributed in 2016 under this initiative;

Support to the school meal reinforcement programme (PERA): In 2015/2016 Navigator granted daily breakfasts
to more than 252 pupils with food shortage, which totalled 24,933 meals. The aid is delivered under a
partnership programme with the Ministry of Education and covers schools in the catchment areas of the plants;

Cooperation agreements with institutions working in the fields of social inclusion, sport and the arts, with
programmes in the local communities around the Group’s facilities.

Paper grants: in 2016 grants were given out to schools and charities in the plants' catchment areas; social,
educational and cultural projects were donated up to 24 tons of paper. Furthermore, ongoing aid is provided
to the boards of schools of the communities around the Group's plants and facilities, which is translated into
fundamental support for the educational communities;

Aid to the Fundacdo Nossa Senhora do Bom Sucesso foundation: Founded in 1951, the Foundation has worked
towards health and human development, in particular child and women's health, by delivering top quality
services irrespective of the social and economic background of users;

Support to the Salvador Association: An Association that works to defend the interests and rights of persons
with reduced mobility, especially individuals with physical disability;

Support to the Quinta Esséncia Association: A charity that helps people with intellectual disabilities to achieve
independence through the integrated development of their personal, social and vocational skills.

Support to MDV Projecto Familia: A pioneering project in Portugal, seeking to work with families with children
at risk. The aim is to keep the family together through intensive, immediate and individualised support;

Support to Caritas Portuguesa;

Support to the Ronald McDonald Foundation in Lisbon and Porto.

in the United States;

Cement: -34.5 million euros, reflecting the supplementary capital payment of 140 million euros made by
Semapa in December 2016. These developments also include investments of 23 million euros, the settlement
of 30.25 million euros payable to Semapa, contribution paid to the sellers of Supremo (35 million euros), and
the effect of the foreign currency denominated debt by approximately +23.9 million euros;

8.2. FINANCIAL RESULTS

In 2016 financial results amounted to a negative figure of 74.3 million euros, improving 39.2% in relation to the figure
recorded in the previous year. The positive variation of 48.0 million euros was primarily the result of:

e Positive effect arising from a decrease in interest rates, debt repayment and debt renegotiation in more
favourable conditions;

e = Interest accrued as a result of the integration of the Supremo Group;

e The recording of the non-recurrent cost of around 7.9 million euros concerning the early repayment of the final
tranche of Portucel Senior Notes 5.375%, amounting to 150 million euros. In September 2015, Navigator had
already repaid 200 million euros of the bonds issued, of which 16.2 million euros in costs were recorded in the
third quarter of 2015.

In 2016 the capital markets behaved in an extremely risk-averse way and were highly volatile. The PSI20 was down by
11.9%. Prices were hit by fears of slower growth in the Portuguese economy and doubts concerning budgetary
execution. London was the best performing stock market exchange: despite the instability generated by Brexit, it once
again confounded expectation with a 14% gain for the year in the FTSE. On the other side of the Atlantic, performance
was positive, for both the US DJI and the Brazilian Bovespa indexes.

In this context, the value of Semapa shares had a positive out turn in the period, as it increased by 5.6%, above PSI20
average (-11.9%). The Semapa share value reached a high of 13.40 euros on 30 December and a low of 9.661 euros on
27 June.

8.5. DIVIDENDS

In May 2016 Semapa distributed dividends with a total value of 26.7 million euros, corresponding to 0.329 euros per

share.

In May 2016, Navigator paid dividends and distributed reserves totalling 170 million euros, corresponding to 0.159 euros
per share and 0.0781021 euros per share, respectively.

8.6. NET INCOME

Consolidated net income in 2016 attributable to shareholders of Semapa was 114.9 million euros, which represents an
improvement of 40.9% compared to the same period in the previous year. Net income per share stood at 1.42
euros/share.

This improvement is explained essentially by the combined effect of the following factors:
e = Anincrease in total EBITDA of approximately 10.9 million euros;
e Anincrease in depreciation and impairment losses of 47.7 million euros, arising namely from:

- The depreciation, for the first time, of the new capital projects in Cacia, Vila Velha de Réddo and Colombo
(Pellets), and the full consolidation of Supremo;

- Non-recurrent adjustments resulting from the write-off of fixed assets after the fire in Vila Velha de Rodao
(1.9 million euros), the revaluation of fixed assets in Mozambique which resulted in impairment losses
associated with field works (45.5 million euros), which reflects a conservative approach to the ongoing
project, considering the country’s current context. Additionally, Secil recorded impairments, net of
deferred taxes in the total amount of 6.8 million euros.

e Change in provisions amounting to 6.6 million euros, due essentially to the release of provisions in the previous
year, which proved to be unnecessary;

e  Animprovement of net financial results by about 48.0 million euros, in relation to the previous year;

e The improvement of income taxes by about 53.9 million euros, reflecting a series of reversals of tax provisions
in the final quarter of 2016, as a result of closure of the tax inspection of the Navigator Company in relation to
the financial year of 2013, favourable court decisions adding up to 23 million euros and also the positive impact
of adoption of the revaluation rules published in Decree-Law 66/2016, of 3 November, with a net effect
totalling 16 million euros. In 2015, income taxes were negatively affected by the reversal of deferred taxes on
the tax losses incurred by Semapa;

e The appropriation of lower results from Navigator in the first half of 2016 vs. the previous year (69.40% versus
81.19%, respectively), following the Public Exchange Offer completed in July 2015.

no. 4 of Article 9, regarding the number of shares that shall correspond to one vote;

The payment of dividends arising from 2015 income of approximately 26.7 million euros (32.9 cents per
outstanding share).

e = At the end of July the International Financial Corporation — IFC — acquired a stake in Portucel Mogambique, by
subscribing the initial amount of 5 million USD.

e — ETSA, through the ITS/LLF consortium, concluded in August with the Food and Veterinary Directorate General
(DGAV), for the duration of 3 years, the service acquisition contract for the collection of dead animals on the
farm, transport to the slaughterhouse and stables, and processing and elimination, amounting to 35.993 million

euros.

e In December, Semapa made supplementary capital payments of 140 million euros to its subsidiary Secil, 30.25
million euros of which was used to repay Semapa's debt.

e In 2016 Semapa — Sociedade de Investimento e Gestdo, SGPS, S.A. purchased 956,322 own shares, an
investment of approximately 10 million euros. Semapa completed the year with 586,329 own shares in the
portfolio, representing 0.721% of its share capital.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

e Last 27 January, Secil signed a purchase contract of assets in Spain, currently belonging to the LafargeHolcim
group. The assets include a cement terminal, two quarries and thirteen ready-mix concrete plants in the
Spanish regions of Asturias, Galiza and Castilla and Ledn. This acquisition will enable Secil to expand its activity
to a new geography and increase its cement sales from Portugal. This transaction is dependent on several
preliminary conditions that need to be met, as is usual in similar operations.

10. OUTLOOK

This was another difficult year for the world economy: the key features of 2016 were the stagnation of global trade, the
low level of investment and growing political uncertainty. In Europe, the economy experienced moderate growth over
the year, with positive signs undermined by political events, in particular the United Kingdom's decision to exit the
European Union. After growth of 2% in GDP in 2015 in the Euro Zone, growth is expected to slow down in 2016-2018,
with estimates pointing to figures between 1.5% and 1.7%. However, fiscal stimulus and growth-oriented policies in
place in some of the major economies, in particular the US, have the potential to unlock new dynamics in the economy.

PAPER AND PULP

After an especially poor third quarter for the paper market, demand showed signs of improving at the end of the year,
and Navigator recorded an increase in sales to Europe and other markets (excluding the United States). In December,
Navigator announced a price increase for UWF paper in the North Africa, Middle East and Turkish markets, implemented
in early 2017. Since then Navigator has continued to observe improving market conditions, visible in a robust level of
orders, encouraging it to announce a price rise for its UWF products in Europe of approximately 4%, with effect from 24
February 2017.

In the short fibre pulp market, the end of the year saw a recovery in sales, as demand picked up from Chinese buyers.
New capacity has come onto the market, albeit at lower levels than originally anticipated, and the Chinese authorities
have continued to close down obsolete capacity; the combination of these two factors was largely responsible for the
recovery in demand. Sales price rose in Asia in the final quarter of 2016, and greater upward pressure could also be
observed on pulp prices in Europe at the start of 2017. Nonetheless, despite these positive signs, there are still concerns
about the rapid growth in pulp supply anticipated for 2017 and 2018, and fears that the growth in demand will fail to
keep pace with the increase in new capacity expected on the market. At the same time, foreign exchange trends will be
a fundamental factor in determining the competitiveness of pulp manufacturers.

Tissue remains one of the main driving forces in global demand for pulp, with annual growth in output estimated at
around 1 million tons. In Europe, estimates point to growth in tissue of around 2.2% in 2016, with the away-from-home
segment expansion sustained by improvements in employment and disposable income. The prospects for 2017 appear
to be in line with the previous year, constrained by the general state of the economy and in particular by the level of
employment and growth in earnings.

Concerning the Colombo Energy Inc. project in the pellet business unit, expectations for 2017 point to a difficult year,
whilst prospects appear more positive as from 2018 in Europe, and as from 2020-2021 in Japan, due to large-scale
investment plans for this period: Colombo Energy is already turning the focus of its sales efforts in this direction. In
addition, the company is pressing ahead with market research into the residential segment in the US, and aspires in the
future to channelling 10 to 20 % of its output into the American domestic market.

The Group has been monitoring carefully the economic and political developments in Mozambique, permanently
reassessing the situation, and has decided to scale down the pace of its operations locally. The country's political and
economic environment remains unstable, translating into movement restrictions and safety concerns for staff and the
service providers involved in the project.

CEMENT

For Portugal, GDP growth outlooks for 2017 are still moderate; according to the latest projections of the Bank of
Portugal, it is expected to increase 1.4%. The increase in some of the building sector's indicators in 2016, like
employment, the sale of dwellings, the number of new licensed dwellings and the amount of public works contracts
awarded create moderately positive expectations in the national market. Regarding exports, the outlook is moderately
negative.

In Lebanon 2017 should not be very different to 2016. The changes which have occurred in the Middle East have not
helped to preserve macroeconomic stability. Despite the slowdown that is expected in residential construction and
lower investor confidence, caused by the lingering uncertain political situation in the country and region, the cement
market should be flat or drop slightly in 2017. The competitive environment is expected to remain challenging. Block
sales should rise in the coming months, since orders increased.

A 2.8% growth of the economy is the forecast for Tunisia (World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2016) 1.5% above
2016. However, economic growth prospects remain uncertain due to recent events and the unstable environment.
Competition should continue to be intense and increased pressure on sales prices is expected (in the domestic and
foreign markets).

The IMF is forecasting 1.5% economic growth in Angola for 2017. Government programmes to diversify the economy in
2016, the upward trend of oil prices on the international markets and the elections in 2017 are expected to foster
growth of the economy and cement consumption.

Brazil is expected to grow modestly by 0.5% in 2017 (World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2016), which foretells the
continuation of the difficulties in economic activity and especially in the activities tied to the construction sector, due
to the difficulty in investments coming to fruition. The political framework is still the greatest threat to economic growth,
which is largely dependent on the government's capacity to pass the necessary reforms to improve the expectations of
public and private economic agents. In line with falling inflation, interest rates are expected to go down sending out a
positive sign, thus driving the expenses of companies and households down, possibly driving consumption and
investment. The government has announced a public-private partnership program for infra-structure development, but
that will only produce effect in the beginning of the second half of the year, hereby improving the context of the civil
construction sector.

In this unstable macroeconomic framework and in spite of some improvement signs, the cement market is expected to
drop again. Notwithstanding, the performance of Brazilian companies is expected to improve and sales should grow,
driven by product quality, technology used, low production costs and marketing dynamic. The opening of new
distribution centres and the purchase of concrete units will help to mitigate the market slowdown and complement the
trade dynamics.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016

ENVIRONMENT

Considering the current macroeconomic, financial and sector environment, current conditions are envisaged to remain
unchanged in the medium term in the sector operated by the ETSA group, insofar as consumption of foodstuffs are
maintained (due to actual increase or simply to changes in the average shopping basket), the animal slaughter rate
remains stable, after a period of reinvestment in the main collection centres and especially after the implementation of
gradual import replacement mechanisms which, consequently, will allow the volume of by-products generated to be
maintained. However, the competition between operators in arranging raw material, which is scanty, will remain
intense, because of the pronounced overcapacity of industrial processing.

The ETSA group’s prime objectives in the short term include (i) concentrating on the horizontal expansion of its
production and destination markets (exports accounted for around 52.5% of total sales in 2016), (ii) identifying fresh
opportunities for vertical growth, channelling its investments to improving operational efficiency, extracting maximum
value from the channels operated and retaining the loyalty of the main conventional and alternative collection centres,
(iii) the gradual and progressive recovery of balanced sales margins in the market, and (iv) focus on sustained innovation
and research and development addressed at ensuring new profit thresholds for the business.

12. PROPOSED ALLOCATION OF PROFITS
Considering that the Company needs to maintain a financial structure compatible with the sustained growth of the
Group it manages in the various Business Areas in which it operates, and

Considering that the Company’s independence from the financial sector involves preserving consolidated levels of short,
medium and long-term debt, which allow it to maintain sound solvency indicators, and

Since the Remuneration Committee and the company's Executive Board have taken a stance on the amounts which, in
their view, may be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the Company's Employees, respectively, for the
financial year 2016, the total approximate amount of which is known,

It is proposed to:

1. That the Net Profits for the individual period, determined under the SNC rules, in the amount of 89,520,902.81
euros (eighty-nine million, five hundred and twenty thousand nine hundred and two euros and eighty-one cents)

be allocated as follows:
Dividends on shares in circulation 36,307,651.95 euros*
(45 cents per share)

Free reserves 48,813,250.86 euros

Share of the Employees and Directors
in the profits of the financial year up to 4,400,000.00 euros
* excluding own shares held; 586,329 own shares were considered; on the payment date, if this amount is
changed, the total dividends payable may be adjusted, while the amount payable per share will remain
unchanged.

2. That the individual distribution of the share in profits be made by the Executive Board in that which relates to the

Employees and by the Remuneration Committee in that which relates to the directors and, since this amount was
already reflected in the financial statements, it shall be transferred to item Free Reserves.

3. That the amount regarding the participation of Employees and Directors in the annual profits which in accordance
