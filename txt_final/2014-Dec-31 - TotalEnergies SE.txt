1. History and strategy of TOTAL

1.1. History and development

TOTAL S.A., a French société anonyme (limited company)
incorporated on March 28, 1924 is, together with its subsidiaries
and affiliates, the world’s fourth largest publicly-traded integrated
international oil and gas company").

With operations in more than 130 countries, TOTAL is engaged in
every sector of the oil industry, including upstream (hydrocarbon
exploration, development and production) and downstream
(refining, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals, trading and shipping
of crude oil and petroleum products and marketing). TOTAL also
operates in the power generation and renewable energy sectors.

TOTAL began its Upstream operations in the Middle East in 1924.
Since then, the Company has grown and expanded its operations

1.2. Strategy

worldwide. In early 1999, the Company acquired control of
PetroFina S.A. (hereafter referred to as “PetroFina” or “Fina”) and in
early 2000 it acquired control of Elf Aquitaine S.A. (hereafter
referred to as “Elf Aquitaine” or “Elf”).

The Company's corporate name is TOTAL S.A.

The Company's registered office is 2, place Jean Millier,
La Défense 6, 92400 Courbevoie, France.

Its telephone number is +33 1 47 44 45 46 and its Internet address
is total.com.

TOTAL S.A. is registered in France at the Nanterre Trade Register
under number 542 051 180.

TOTAL provides energy-related products and services to customers
around the world by discovering, producing and transforming oil
and gas, as well as other natural resources (solar and biomass).

The Group’s goal is to be a global, integrated energy company -

a leading international oil company and a world-class operator in gas,
petrochemicals, solar energy and, tomorrow, biomass. To realize
this goal, TOTAL leverages its integrated business model, which
enables it to capture synergies between the different business
segments of the Group. Together, TOTAL’s commitments to ethical
practices, safety and corporate social responsibility form a shared
foundation allowing the achievement of four strategic objectives:

— driving profitable, sustainable growth in exploration and production;

— developing competitive, top-tier refining and petrochemical
complexes;

— responding to customer needs by delivering innovative solutions; and

— consolidating the Group’s leadership in solar energy and
continuing to explore biomass, in order to offer the most
appropriate energy solutions.

At the core of TOTAL's strategy is a strong belief that energy is vital,
drives progress and must be made available to everyone. Energy is
a precious resource that must be used wisely.

The Group is helping to produce the growing amount of energy
that people around the planet need to live and thrive, while ensuring
that its operations consistently deliver economic, social and
environmental benefits. TOTAL is meeting this challenge with

and for its fellow employees, its stakeholders and the local
communities, in ways that exceed what is generally expected.

Respect, responsibility and exemplary behavior are the values that
underpin TOTAL’s Code of Conduct. It is through strict adherence
to these core values and fundamental principles that TOTAL will
be able to build strong and sustainable growth for the Group

and its stakeholders.

* -6% essentially for the expiration of the ADCO license in the
United Arab Emirates;

* -2% essentially for normal decline and higher maintenance in 2014
notably in the first half, partially offset by production growth in the
Utica in the United States; and

2.1. Exploration & Production

2.1.1. Exploration and development

TOTAL’s Exploration & Production activities aim at continuing to
combine long-term growth and profitability at the level of the best
actors of the industry.

TOTAL evaluates exploration opportunities based on a variety of
geological, technical, political, economic (including taxes and
license terms), environmental and societal factors and on projected
oil and gas prices. Discoveries of new fields and extensions of
existing fields have brought an additional 2,446 Mboe to the
Upstream segment’s proved reserves during the 3-year period
ended December 31, 2014 (before deducting production and sales
of reserves in place and adding any acquisitions of reserves in
place during this period). The net level of revisions during this
8-year period is +181 Mboe, which was due to the overall positive
revisions in field behaviors partially offset by the negative impacts of
the increase of bitumen price in Canada (from $50.4/b in 2013 to
$60.3/b in 2014 for Synbit), the increase in U.S. onshore gas price
(from 2011 ($4.21/MBtu) to 2012 ($2.85/MBtu) for Henry Hub) and
a perimeter change in two projects.

In 2014, the exploration investments of consolidated subsidiaries
amounted to $2,608 million (excluding exploration bonuses),
primarily in Angola, Brazil, Norway, South Africa, Iraq, Malaysia,
Céte d'Ivoire, Indonesia and Libya. Exploration investments of
consolidated subsidiaries amounted to $2,926 million in 2013 and
$2,701 million in 2012. For 2015, the exploration budget has been
reduced to $1.9 billion to reflect the new market environment.

The Group’s consolidated Exploration & Production subsidiaries’
organic" investments amounted to $23 billion in 2014, primarily
in Angola, Norway, Australia, Canada, Nigeria, the Republic

of the Congo, Russia, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Gabon,
the United States and Kazakhstan. The Group’s consolidated
Exploration & Production subsidiaries’ organic investments
amounted to $24 billion in 2013 and $20 billion in 2012.

2.1.2. Reserves

The definitions used for proved, proved developed and proved
undeveloped oil and gas reserves are in accordance with the United
States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 4-10 of
Regulation S-X as amended by the SEC Modernization of Oil and
Gas Reporting release issued on December 31, 2008. Proved
reserves are estimated using geological and engineering data to
determine with reasonable certainty whether the crude oil or natural
gas in known reservoirs is recoverable under existing regulatory,
economic and operating conditions.

TOTAL’s oil and gas reserves are consolidated annually, taking
into account, among other factors, levels of production, field
reassessments, additional reserves from discoveries and
acquisitions, disposal of reserves and other economic factors.

Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to TOTAL’s proved
reserves, proved developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves
and production reflects the Group’s entire share of such reserves or

such production. TOTAL’s worldwide proved reserves include the
proved reserves of its consolidated subsidiaries as well as its
proportionate share of the proved reserves of equity affiliates.

For further information concerning changes in TOTAL'’s proved
reserves for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
see “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)” in
chapter 11.

The reserves estimation process involves making subjective
judgments. Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact
measurements and are subject to revision under well-established
control procedures.

The reserves booking process requires, among other things:

— internal peer reviews of technical evaluations to ensure that the
SEC definitions and guidance are followed; and

— that management makes significant funding commitments
towards the development of the reserves prior to booking.

For further information regarding the preparation of reserves
estimates, see “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)”
in chapter 11.

2.1.3. Proved reserves for years 2014,
2013 and 2012

In accordance with the amended Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-x,
proved reserves at December 31 are calculated using a 12-month
average price determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of
the first-day-of-the-month price for each month of the relevant year
unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding
escalations based upon future conditions. The reference prices for
2014, 2013 and 2012 were, respectively, $101.27/b, $108.02/b
and $111.13/b for Brent crude.

As of December 31, 2014, TOTAL’s combined proved reserves of
oil and gas were 11,523 Mboe (50% of which were proved
developed reserves). Liquids (crude oil, condensates, natural gas
liquids and bitumen) represented approximately 46% of these
reserves and natural gas the remaining 54%. These reserves were
located in Europe (mainly in Norway and the United Kingdom), in
Africa (mainly in Angola, Gabon, Nigeria and the Republic of the
Congo), in the Americas (mainly in Canada, Argentina, the United
States and Venezuela), in the Middle East (mainly in Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates and Yemen), and in Asia (mainly in Australia,
Kazakhstan and Russia).

As of December 31, 2013, TOTAL’s combined proved reserves of oil
and gas were 11,526 Mboe (49% of which were proved developed
reserves). Liquids (crude oil, condensates, natural gas liquids and
bitumen) represented approximately 47% of these reserves and
natural gas the remaining 53%. As of December 31, 2012, TOTAL’s
combined proved reserves of oil and gas were 11,368 Mboe (51%
of which were proved developed reserves). Liquids (crude oil,
condensates, natural gas liquids and bitumen) represented approximately
50% of these reserves and natural gas the remaining 50%.


--- Page 12 ---

2.1.4. Sensitivity to oil and gas prices

Changes in the price used as a reference for the proved reserves
estimation result in non-proportionate inverse changes in proved
reserves associated with production sharing and risked service
contracts (which together represent approximately 21% of TOTAL’s
reserves as of December 31, 2014). Under such contracts, TOTAL
is entitled to a portion of the production, the sale of which is meant
to cover expenses incurred by the Group. As oil prices increase,
fewer barrels are necessary to cover the same amount of expenses.
Moreover, the number of barrels recoverable under these contracts
may vary according to criteria such as cumulative production, the
rate of return on investment or the income-cumulative expenses
ratio. This decrease is partly offset by an extension of the duration
over which fields can be produced economically. However, the
increase in reserves due to extended field life resulting from higher
prices is generally less than the decrease in reserves under
production sharing or risked service contracts due to such higher
prices. As a result, higher prices usually lead to a decrease in
TOTAL's reserves.

Furthermore, changes in the reference price per barrel used for the
proved reserves estimation have an impact on the volume of
royalties in Canada and thus TOTAL's share of proved reserves.

Lastly, for any type of contract, a significant decrease of the
reference price of petroleum products may involve a reduction of
proved reserves.

2.1.5. Production

For the full year 2014, average daily oil and gas production was
2,146 kboe/d compared to 2,299 kboe/d in 2013 and 2,300 kboe/d
in 2012. Liquids accounted for approximately 48% and natural gas
for approximately 52% of TOTAL’s combined liquids and natural gas
production in 2014.

The tables on the next pages set forth by geographic area TOTAL’s
annual and average daily production of liquids and natural gas for
each of the last three years.

Consistent with industry practice, TOTAL often holds a percentage
interest in its fields rather than a 100% interest, with the balance
being held by joint venture partners (which may include other

international oil companies, state-owned oil companies or
government entities). TOTAL's entities frequently act as operator
(the party responsible for technical production) on acreage in which
it holds an interest. See the table “Presentation of production
activities by geographic area” on the following pages for a
description of TOTAL's producing assets.

As in 2013 and 2012, substantially all of the liquids production

from TOTAL’s Upstream segment in 2014 was marketed by the
Trading & Shipping division of TOTAL’s Refining & Chemicals
segment (see table “Trading’s crude oil sales and supply and refined
products sales” in paragraph 3.2.1. of this chapter).

The majority of TOTAL's natural gas production is sold under long-term
contracts. However, its North American production, and part of its
production from the United Kingdom, Norway and Argentina, is
sold on the spot market. The long-term contracts under which
TOTAL sells its natural gas usually provide for a price related to,
among other factors, average crude oil and other petroleum
product prices, as well as, in some cases, a cost-of-living index.
Though the price of natural gas tends to fluctuate in line with crude
oil prices, a slight delay may occur before changes in crude oil
prices are reflected in long-term natural gas prices. Due to the
interaction between the contract price of natural gas and crude oil
prices, contract prices are not usually affected by short-term
market fluctuations in the spot price of natural gas.

Some of TOTAL's long-term contracts, notably in Indonesia,
Nigeria, Norway, Qatar Thailand and Yemen, specify the delivery
of quantities of natural gas that may or may not be fixed and
determinable. Such delivery commitments vary substantially, both
in duration and in scope, from contract to contract throughout the
world. For example, in some cases, contracts require delivery of
natural gas on an as-needed basis, and, in other cases, contracts
call for the delivery of varied amounts of natural gas over different
periods of time. Nevertheless, TOTAL estimates the fixed

and determinable quantity of gas to be delivered over the period
2015-2017 to be 3,782 Bcf. The Group expects to satisfy most of
these obligations through the production of its proved reserves of
natural gas, with, if needed, additional sourcing from spot market
purchases (see chapter 11, “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information
(Unaudited)” of this Registration Document).

(50%, operator) in September 2013. This license, which covers an
area of 19,000 km2, is located approximately 175 km south of the
South African coast in water depths ranging from 200 m to 1,800 m.
The drilling of an exploration well, which began in July 2014 and
stopped at the beginning of October 2014, should resume when all
of the conditions permit.

In addition, the Group holds a technical cooperation license for the
Outeniqua Block (100%), which covers approximately 76,000 km?
and is located to the southwest of the 11B-12B license in water
depths ranging from 400 m to 4,000 m.

In Algeria, TOTAL’s production was 20 kboe/d during 2014,
compared with 21 kboe/d in 2013 and 23 kboe/d in 2012. All of the
Group's production in Algeria comes from the Tin Fouyé Tabankort
(TFT) field (85%). TOTAL also has a 37.75% stake in the Timimoun
gas development project.

— The development of the Timimoun field continued in 2014.
The plant construction contract was signed in February 2014
and the drilling rig contract in September 2014.

— TOTAL decided not to implement the Ahnet project and
abandoned the Ain Enakhal exploration well.

In Angola, the Group’s production in 2014 was 200 kboe/d,
compared with 186 kboe/d in 2013 and 179 kboe/d in 2012.

This production comes primarily from Blocks 0, 14 and 17. Recent
highlights include the start-up of production on the Pazflor project
in 2011 and the CLOV project in 2014, as well as the acquisition of
interests in the exploration blocks 25, 39 and 40 in the Kwanza basin.

— Deep offshore Block 17 (40%, operator) is TOTAL's principal
asset in Angola. It is composed of four major producing hubs:
Girassol, Dalia, Pazflor and CLOV. CLOV, the newest hub, was
launched in 2010, started production in June 2014 and reached
its plateau production of 160 kboe/d in September 2014.

— On the ultra-deep offshore Block 32 (30%, operator), the
Kaombo project was launched in April 2014 to develop the
discoveries in the southeast part of the block via two FPSOs
(Floating Production Storage and Offloading facilities) with a
capacity of 115 kb/d each. Production start-up is planned for
2017. The exploration and delineation of the center and north
parts of the block is ongoing.

— On Block 14 (20%""), production comes from the Tombua-Landana
and Kuito fields as well as the BBLT project, comprising the
Benguela, Belize, Lobito and Tomboco fields.

— Block 14K (36.75%) is the offshore unitization zone between
Angola (Block 14) and the Republic of the Congo (Haute Mer
license). Launched in 2012, the development of the Lianzi field
will be via a connection to the existing BBLT platform (Block 14).
TOTAL's interest in the unitized block is held 10% through Angola
Block 14 BV and 26.75% through Total E&P Congo.

(1) Interest held by the company Angola Block 14 BV (TOTAL 50.01%, INPEX Corporation 49.99% since February 2013).

— On Block 0 (10%), the development of Mafumeira Sul was
approved by the partners and the authorities in 2012. This
project constitutes the second development phase of the
Mafumeira field.

— In April 2014, TOTAL sold its entire stake in Block 15/06 (15%).

TOTAL has interests in exploration block 17/06 (80%, operator) in
the Lower-Congo basin and blocks 25 (35%, operator), 39 (15%)
and 40 (40%, operator) in the deep offshore Kwanza basin.

In 2014 and early 2015, the Group drilled pre-salt targets on blocks
25, 39 and 40. TOTAL relinquished its interest in Block 33 (58.67%,
operator) in November 2014.

TOTAL is also developing its LNG activities through the Angola LNG
project (13.6%), which includes a gas liquefaction plant near Soyo
supplied in particular by the gas associated with production from
Blocks 0, 14, 15, 17 and 18. LNG production started in June 2013
but various technical incidents required the extended shut down of
the plant.

In Céte d'Ivoire, TOTAL is active in four deep offshore exploration
licenses located 50 km to 100 km from the coast and covering
approximately 5,200 km? at water depths ranging from 1,000 m
to 3,000 m.

On the Cl-100 license (60%, operator) located in the Tano basin,
an initial exploration well (Ivoire-1X) was drilled in early 2013 at a
water depth of more than 2,300 meters.

On the licenses Cl-514 (54%, operator), Cl-515 (45%) and Cl-516
(45%) situated in the San Pedro basin, a 3D seismic survey was
carried out in 2012 and three exploration wells were drilled in 2014.

In Egypt, TOTAL relinquished Block 4 (East El Burullus Offshore;
50% operator) at the end of the first exploration period in
August 2014 after having drilled the Kala-1 well in 2013.

In September 2014, TOTALwas awarded Block 2 (North El Mahala
Onshore) located in the Nile delta.

In Gabon, the Group’s production in 2014 was 58 kboe/d
compared with 59 kboe/d in 2013 and 57 kboe/d in 2012.
The Group's exploration and production activities in Gabon are
mainly carried out by Total Gabon®).

— As part of the redevelopment project (estimated production
capacity 20 kboe/d) of the Anguille field (100%, operator),
the AGM North platform was installed in 2012. Production from
the platform started in 2013 and fourteen wells are operational.

— In the Torpille field (100%, operator), a 3D seismic survey is
underway.

— On the deep offshore Diaba license (42.5%, operator), an initial
exploration well (Diaman-1B) was drilled in 2013 at a water depth
of more than 1,700 M. This well revealed an accumulation of gas
and condensates. A 3D seismic survey was acquired in the
western part of the block in the fourth quarter of 2014.

— The Nguongui-updip well drilled on the Mutamba-lroru license
(50%) in 2012 revealed the presence of hydrocarbons.

— On the Nziembou license (20%), the drilling of the Igongo-1X well
revealed a multi-layer accumulation of oil and gas and the drilling
of the Monbou 1 prospect was completed in early January 2015.

In Kenya, TOTAL has interests on the offshore L5 and L7 licenses
(40%) and the L11a, L11b and L12 licenses (30% after selling 10%
of the stake in December 2014) and is the operator of the L22
license (70%) located in the Lamu delta in water depths ranging
from 1,000 m to 3,500 m.

In 2013, two exploration wells were drilled in Blocks L7 and L11b.

On the offshore L22 license, seabed core drilling operations were
carried out in early 2014 and a 3D seismic survey was carried out,
benefitting from synergies with the adjacent blocks.

In Libya, the Group’s production in 2014 was 27 kb/d compared
with 50 kb/d in 2013 and 62 kb/d in 2012. TOTAL is a 75%") partner
in the Mabruk (Blocks 70 and 87) and Al Jurf (Blocks 15, 16 and
82) zones operated by Mabruk Oil Operations, a company held by
National Oil Corporation (NOC) and TOTAL. In addition, TOTAL is a
partner in the El Sharara zone (which comprises Blocks 129 and
130 (30%) and 130 and 131 (24%I")). Finally, TOTAL is the
operator of the NC191 (100%) exploration block.

The security situation in 2014 led the Group to gradually reduce the
number of its personnel in Libya. Beginning in mid-2013 and
through to the summer of 2014, production was affected by the
blockade of most of the country’s terminals and pipelines.

— In the onshore blocks 70 and 87 (Mabruk), production has been
stopped since August 2013 due to the blockade of the Es Sider
export terminal. Production resumed in September 2014 with
the reopening of the terminal before being disrupted again
mid-December due to the security situation near the Es Sider
terminal; the field has not been producing since then.

— Inthe onshore blocks 129, 130 and 131 (EI Sharara),
production was interrupted several times in 2014. Nevertheless,
the exploration of these blocks continued in 2014 with
the drilling of three wells.

— In the offshore blocks 15, 16 and 32 (Al Jurf), production has not
been affected by the social unrest in the country. However, the
A1-16/3 exploration well which began drilling at year-end 2013
was plugged and temporarily abandoned in August 2014.

In Madagascar, TOTAL is active on the Bemolanga 3102 license
(60%, operator). A two-year extension of the exploration phase was
approved by the local authorities in August 2014.

In Morocco, on the 100,000 km? Anzarane offshore reconnaissance
contract which was granted in December 2011 to TOTAL and
ONHYM (National Bureau of Petroleum and Mines), an extension
was granted until December 2015. The processing and
interpretation of a 3D seismic survey, acquired in 2013 in the
southern part of the block, is ongoing.

In Mauritania, the Group holds exploration interests in the
ultra-deep offshore C9 license (90%, operator) and the onshore
Ta29 license (72%, operator) in the Taoudenni basin, both acquired
in 2012.

— On Block Ta29, following the results of the 2D seismic survey
performed in 2012, studies are underway to assess the block.
In 2013, TOTAL sold an 18% stake in Block Ta29, reducing its
stake to 72%.

— A3D seismic survey campaign covering 4,700 km? was
conducted on Block C9 in 2013.

— Furthermore, at the end of the exploration period in July 2014,
Blocks Ta7 and Ta8 (60%, operator) were relinquished to the
authorities.

In Mozambique, TOTAL acquired a 40% stake in the production
sharing contract for offshore zones 3 and 6 in 2012. Located in the
Rovuma basin, these two blocks cover an area of 15,250 km? from
the coast up to water depths of 2,500 m. Half of the area of the
two blocks was relinquished in 2013. A 500 km? 3D seismic survey
was carried out between year-end 2014 and beginning of 2015.

In Nigeria, the Group’s production in 2014 was 257 kboe/d
compared with 261 kboe/d in 2013 and 279 kboe/d in 2012. This
decline was primarily due to the sharp increase in oil bunkering and
a blockade of Nigeria LNG’s export cargoes in 2013. Nigeria is the
leading contributor to the Group’s production.

TOTAL has been present in Nigeria since 1962 and operates five of
the thirty seven oil mining leases (OML) in which it has interests and
also holds interests in four oil prospecting licenses (OPL).

Regarding the principal variations in TOTAL’s permits since 2012:

In September 2013, TOTAL was granted approval by the
authorities to increase its stake in OPL 285 from 26.67% to 60%.

— In May 2018, TOTAL obtained the approval of the authorities for
the renewal of OML 99, 100 and 102 for a period of twenty years.

— On OML 138 (20%), TOTAL started production in the Usan
offshore field in 2012, reaching 130 kboe/d in 2013. In 2014, the
Ukot South-2B and Ukot South-3 exploration wells led to two oil
discoveries. The Group is actively pursuing the sale process
launched in November 2012, which was not able to close.
TOTAL ceased to be the operator of OML 138 in February 2014.

— Block 1 (48.6%, operator) of the Joint Development Zone was
relinquished in September 2013, and OPL 221 was relinquished
in November 2013.

— In 2012, TOTAL sold its 10% stake in OML 30, 34 and 40, which
were operated via the Shell Petroleum Development Company
(SPDC) joint venture. Furthermore, new sales processes for four
blocks (OML 18, 24, 25 & 29) were launched in early 2014,
with the sale of OML 24 finalized in November 2014, and those
of OML 18 and OML 29 finalized in March 2015.

TOTAL continues to develop its operated assets, in particular:

— OML 58 (40%, operator): as part of its joint venture with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), TOTAL is
pursuing a project to increase the block’s gas production
capacity from 370 Mcf/d to 550 Mcf/d.

— OML 102 (40%, operator): TOTAL achieved the flare-out portion
of the Ofon Phase 2 project in December 2014. The associated
gas from the Ofon field is now being compressed, evacuated to
shore and monetized via Nigeria LNG (NLNG).

— OML 130 (24%, operator): the development of the Egina field
(capacity of 200 kboe/d) was launched in June 2013.

— OML 99 (40%, operator): additional studies are underway for the
development of the Ikike field.


--- Page 22 ---

TOTAL is also active in the LNG sector with a 15% stake in Nigeria
LNG Ltd, which owns a liquefaction plant with a total capacity of
22 Mt/y. On Brass LNG, since the withdrawal of one of the
partners, TOTAL’s stake has temporarily increased from 17% to
20.48%. Studies are currently ongoing for a two train liquefaction
plant with a 4.5 Mt/y capacity each.

The Group’s non-operated production in Nigeria comes mainly from
the SPDC joint venture, in which TOTAL holds a 10% stake. The
sharp increase of oil bunkering in 2013, which continued in 2014,
had a negative impact on onshore production, as well as on the
integrity of the joint venture’s facilities and the local environment.

In addition, TOTAL holds a stake in the deep offshore OML 118
(12.5%), including the Bonga field, which contributed 15 kboe/d to
the Group’s production in 2014. On OML 118, a pre-unitization
agreement relating to the Bonga South West/Aparo discovery
(10%) was signed in December 2013.

In Uganda, where TOTAL has been active since 2012, the Group
holds a 33.33% interest in the EA-1, EA-1A and EA-2 licenses as
well as the Kingfisher license, located in the Lake Albert region.
TOTAL is the operator of the EA-1 and EA-1A licenses and a
partner on the other licenses.

— On the EA-1 license, a campaign of wells, production tests and a
3D seismic survey were carried out between 2012 and mid-
2014. As of year-end 2014, five development plans had been
submitted to the authorities: Ngiri (submitted in December 2013),
Jobi-Rii (submitted in June 2014) and Mpyo, Gunya and Jobi
East (submitted in December 2014).

— The EA-1A license expired in February 2013 following a
campaign of five exploration wells that resulted in one discovery
(Lyec). With the exception of the area relating to this discovery,
the license has been returned to the authorities.

— On the EA-2 license, a campaign of wells and production tests
that began in 2012 was completed in 2014. Two development
plans were submitted to the authorities in June 2013 (Kasamene
and Wahrindi fields, as well as those of Kigogole, Ngege, Ngara
and Nsoga).

— The development plan for the Kingfisher field, which is located on
the EA-3 production license, was approved by the authorities in
September 2013.

— The Kanywataba license expired in 2012 and was returned to the
authorities.

In the Republic of the Congo, the Group's production in 2014 was
95 kboe/d compared with 93 kboe/d in 2013 and 113 kboe/d in
2012. The reduced production in 2013 was due to a planned
shutdown on the Nkossa field. The decrease in production between
2012 and 2014 was due primarily to the natural decline of the
fields. In December 2013, Qatar Petroleum International Upstream
(QPI) purchased a 15% stake in the capital of Total E&P Congo via
a share capital increase of the subsidiary.

— The Moho Bilondo offshore field (53.5%, operator) reached
plateau production of 90 kboe/d in mid-2010. The Phase 1b
(capacity of 40 kboe/d) and Moho North (capacity of 100 kboe/d)
project was launched in March 2018, with production start-up
planned in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

— Block 14K (36.75%) corresponds to the offshore unitization zone
between the Haute Mer license in the Republic of the Congo and
Block 14 in Angola. The development of the Lianzi field was
launched in 2012. TOTAL holds a 26.75% interest in the unitized
block through Total E&P Congo and a 10% interest through
Angola Block 14 BV.

— In July 2013, TOTAL obtained the Haute Mer B license (34.62%,
operator). The authorities approved the license in June 2014.

— As part of the renewal of the Loango and Zatchi licenses, an
agreement on the related contractual and fiscal conditions was
signed in October 2013. Following the approval of the authorities
in June 2014, TOTAL’s interests in these licenses decreased
respectively from 50% to 42.50% for Loango and from 35% to
29.75% for Zatchi, with retroactive effect from October 2013.

In the Lake Albert region of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, the Block Ill (66.66%, operator) exploration license was
granted in 2012 for an initial three-year period. As a result of the
security situation in the eastern part of the country in 2012, the
license was extended for one year. The prospecting program is
limited to the northern portion of the license, which is outside the
Virunga park.

In the Republic of South Sudan, TOTAL is negotiating a new
contract with the authorities that would enable it to resume
exploration activities in part of Block B. Since the independence of
the Republic of South Sudan in 2011, TOTAL is no longer present
in Sudan.

2.1.7.2. North America

In 2014, TOTAL’s production in North America was 90 kboe/d,
representing 4% of the Group’s total production, compared
with 73 kboe/d in 2013 and 69 kboe/d in 2012.

In Canada, the Group’s production in 2014 was 12 kboe/d
compared to 13 kboe/d in 2013 and 12 kboe/d in 2012.

The Group’s oil sands portfolio is focused around two themes:
Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) on the Surmont (50%)
asset, and mining at Fort Hills (89.2%). In addition, the Group holds
stakes in a number of other oil sands leases including Joslyn
(38.25%, operator) and Northern Lights (50%, operator).

— On Surmont, in order to optimize production, additional wells
were drilled in 2013 and a decision was made to construct an
additional steam generation unit.

The second Surmont development phase is under construction
(total capacity of phase 1 and 2 estimated at 130 kb/d).

— The development of the Fort Hills project, with an estimated
capacity of 180 kb/d, is under way.

— On the Joslyn and Nothern Lights assets, a final investment
decision is not expected in the near future due to the degraded
economic environment.

— Due to the current economic environment, the Group impaired its
oil sands assets in Canada by $2.2 billion in its 2014 consolidated
accounts.

— In 2013, TOTAL finalized the sale of its 49% stake in the Voyageur
upgrader project.

(33.33%) started production in early 2014;

- the TOTAL (40%) - Cobalt (60%, operator) alliance’s exploration
campaign, which was launched in 2009, resumed in 2012 with
the Ligurian-2 and North Platte wells, resulting in an oil
discovery on the latter. A new drilling campaign commenced in
February 2015 with the drilling of the North Platte 2 well.

— TOTAL is active in shale gas production in Texas via a 25% stake
in ajoint venture operated by Chesapeake in the Barnett Shale
basin. Drilling operations have been sharply reduced since 2012
(approximately 40 wells were drilled in 2014 compared to
approximately 60 in 2013 and approximately 100 in 2012).

— TOTAL is also active in the production of liquids-rich shale gas in
the Utica region in Ohio via a joint venture (25%) operated by
Chesapeake. Approximately 170 wells were drilled in 2014
(compared to more than 200 wells in 2013 and approximately
100 in 2012) and 207 wells have been connected and have
started production (compared with 190 in 2013 and 47 in 2012).
In November 2014, TOTAL sold its 25% stake in Cardinal Gas
Services LLC, a company providing gas collection and treatment
services for Utica.

— The Group holds a 55.7% stake in American Shale Oil LLC (AMSO),
which is developing an in situ shale oil production technology.

representing 7% of the Group’s total production, compared
with 166 kboe/d in 2013 and 182 kboe/d in 2012.

In Argentina, where TOTAL has been present since 1978, the
Group operated approximately 30% of the country’s gas production
in 2014. The Group’s production in 2014 was 75 kboe/d compared
with 78 kboe/d in 2013 and 83 kboe/d in 2012. In 2012, the
Argentinean government concluded gas price agreements with
various producers. Under the terms of these agreements, the
Argentinean government guarantees the price of gas for quantities
above a fixed production level in exchange for compliance with
defined production targets and applicable penalties (i.e., “Deliver or
Pay”). In February 2013, TOTAL signed an agreement of this type
for a period of five years with retroactive effect from December 1, 2012.

— In Tierra del Fuego, the Group operates the Carina and Aries
offshore fields (37.5%). A drilling campaign consisting of two

additional wells began in 2014 based on the existing platform.
The development of the Vega Pleyade field (37.5%, operator)
was launched in October 2013 (production capacity of 350 Mcf/d).

— In the Neuquen basin, TOTAL started a drilling campaign on its
mining licenses in 2011 in order to assess their shale gas and
shale oil potential. This campaign, which started on the Aguada
Pichana licenses (27.3%, operator), was subsequently extended
to all of the blocks. The initial results of the production tests on
the wells drilled during this campaign were all positive. Two pilot
developments intended to test the unconventional production
potential at the Aguada Pichana and Rincon la Ceniza (42.5%,
operator) Blocks have been launched

in the Ocensa pipeline and closing of this transaction occurred in
February 2015.

In French Guiana, TOTAL owns a 25% stake in the Guyane
Maritime license. This license, located approximately 150 km from
the coast in water depths ranging from 200 m to 3,000 m, covers
an area of approximately 24,000 km2. At year-end 2011, the
authorities extended the exploration license until May 31, 2016.

Further to the discovery of Zaedyus, a drilling campaign was
conducted from July 2012 to year-end 2013, but was unable to
confirm the extension of a reservoir.

In Trinidad and Tobago, TOTAL sold all of its exploration and
production interests in 2013. The Group’s production in 2013 was
12 kboe/d and 16 kboe/d in 2012.

In Uruguay, TOTAL holds a 100% stake in three exploration
licenses: offshore Block 14, and onshore Blocks B1 and B2.

— In October 2013, TOTAL signed two exploration and production
contracts for Blocks B1 and B2 for unconventional plays. These

The development phase of the southern zone of PetroCedeno
continues (86 producing wells were drilled at year-end 2014
compared with 43 wells at year-end 2013), as well as the
debottlenecking project for the water separation and treatment
facilities. In 2013, the postponement of an additional
debottlenecking project combined with a performance study
performed on the field led to a revision of PetroCedeno’s reserves.

Pursuant to an amendment to the gas sale contract, a new
development phase of the Yucal Placer field was launched in 2012.
The field’s production reached 150 Mcf/d in April 2014 following the
commissioning of the first clusters and the debottlenecking of the
existing gas treatment train.

2.1.7.4. Asia-Pacific

— At year-end 2012, TOTAL reduced its share in the WA-408
license located in the Browse basin (50%, operator) by disposing
of 50% of its stake. Drilled in the first half of 2018, the first
exploration well, Basset-1, revealed hydrocarbons. Completed at
year-end 2013, the second exploration well has been definitively
abandoned.

— On the WA-408 license (60%, operator) located in the Bonaparte
basin, a well drilled in 2011 indicated the presence of hydrocarbons.
A 3D seismic survey was conducted in 2013. The adjacent Block
WA-402-P was relinquished in July 2014.

— In 2012, TOTAL signed an agreement to enter three shale gas
exploration licenses in the South Georgina basin in the center of
the country. In the second half of 2013, a 2D seismic survey was
conducted on these three licenses.

In Brunei, where TOTAL has been present since 1986, the Group
operates the offshore Maharaja Lela Jamalulalam gas and
condensate field located on Block B (37.5%). The Group’s
production in 2014 was 15 kboe/d compared with 13 kboe/d in
2013 and 12 kboe/d in 2012. The gas is delivered to the Brunei
LNG liquefaction plant.

In 2013, the study regarding the additional development south of

Corporation (CNPC) and TOTAL agreed to a development plan
pursuant to which CNPC is the operator and TOTAL holds a 49%
stake. The authorities approved this development plan in

April 2014. After an initial test phase that began in August 2012,
the Group's production in 2014 was 12 kboe/d compared with

8 kboe/d in 2013. The drilling of development wells continues.

In March 2013, TOTAL and Sinopec concluded a joint study
agreement relating to shale gas potential on the Xuancheng license
(4,000 km?) close to Nanjing. A 2D seismic survey covering 600 km
was conducted from October 2013 to February 2014. The drilling
of an initial exploration well started in late 2014.

In Indonesia, where TOTAL has had operations since 1968, the
Group’s production was 130 kboe/d in 2014 compared with
131 kboe/d in 2013 and 132 kboe/d in 2012.

TOTAL’s operations in Indonesia are primarily concentrated on the
Mahakam license (50%, operator), which covers in particular the
Peciko and Tunu gas fields. TOTAL also has a stake in the Sisi-Nubi
gas field (47.9%, operator). The Group delivers most of its natural
gas production to the Bontang LNG plant. These volumes of gas
accounted for approximately 80% of Bontang’s LNG supply in
2014. This gas production is supplemented by condensate and oil
production from the Handil and Bekapai fields, which are operated
by the Group.

— With regard to the Mahakam license:

- Tunu: in 2014, additional development wells were drilled in the
main reservoir as well as in the shallow gas reservoirs;

- Peciko: phase 7 drilling operations continue;

- South Mahakam: production started in 2012 and development
drilling operations continued. Phase 3 of the project, which
includes the development of the Jempang and Metulang fields,
is currently underway; and

- Sisi-Nubi: drilling operations are continuing within the framework
of a second phase of development. The gas from Sisi-Nubi is
produced through Tunu’s processing facilities.

— On the Sebuku license (15%), production started at the Ruby gas
field in October 2013 with a capacity of approximately 100 Mcf/d.
Ruby’s production is transported by pipeline for processing and
separation at the Senipah terminal operated by TOTAL.

— On the Sadang (30%), Sageri (50%), Arafura Sea (24.5%)
and Amborip VI (24.5%) Blocks, the Group has applied to the
authorities to withdraw from these blocks. In addition, and following
the withdrawal of the other partners, the Group’s stake in the
South Sageri Block increased from 45% to 100% (operator), while
its share in the South Mandar Block increased from 33% to 49.3%.

— In December 2014, TOTAL sold a 20% stake in the Bengkulu
|-Mentawai Block (80%, operator), located in the Bengkulu
offshore basin southwest of Sumatra. An exploration well was
drilled on the block in 2014.

— In early 2015, the Group sold its stakes in the two coal bed
methane (CBM) Blocks located in the province of East Kalimantan,
Kutai Il (18.4%) and Kutai Timur (50%).

— The Group also holds a stake in the Telen Block (100%, operator)
located in East Kalimantan province.

— The Group has decided to withdraw from the South East Mahakam.
exploration Block (50%, operator) in East Kalimantan province
and the South West Bird’s Head exploration Block (90%, operator)

In Malaysia, where TOTAL has been active since 2008, the Group
holds stakes in three exploration licenses (GB-N, DW2E, SK 317 B).

In January 2014, the Group acquired a stake in the DW2E license
(85%, operator) located in deep offshore. A 3D seismic campaign
of 2,050 km? was completed late 2014.

On the SK 317 B exploration Block (85%, operator) located in
Sarawak’s deep offshore, the first exploration well, Pelangi-1,
started in December 2013, revealing gaseous hydrocarbons. A
second exploration well, Pelangi-2, started in November 2014.

At the end of the exploration period, TOTAL withdrew from the
PM324 Block (50%, operator), located in the Malay basin.

In Myanmar, the Group’s production in 2014 was 17 kboe/d
compared with 16 kboe/d in 2013 and 2012.

The Yadana field (31.2%, operator), located on the offshore Blocks
M65 and M6, primarily produces gas for delivery to PTT (Thai state-
owned company) for use in Thai power plants. The Yadana field
also supplies the domestic market via two pipelines built and
operated by MOGE, a Myanmar state-owned company. The LCP-
Badamyar project, which includes the installation of the Badamyar
compression and development platform, connected to the Yadana
facilities, was launched in September 2014.

In 2014, the Group was awarded the deep offshore Block YWB.
(100%, operator) during the offshore round launched by the
Burmese authorities. The PSC was signed in February 2015.

On offshore Block M-11, located in the Martaban basin, the Group
requested a new two-year exploration phase in October 2014 and,
following the withdrawal of a partner, increased its stake from the
40% acquired in 2012 to approximately 47.06%. The first
exploration well, Manizawta-1, was drilled in 2013.

In Papua New Guinea, where TOTAL has been active since 2012,
the Group acquired a stake in Block PRL-15 (40.1%) in March 2014.
The Papua New Guinea government retains the right to acquire

a 22.5% stake in the block when the final investment decision

is made. Following the government's entry, TOTAL's stake would

be reduced to 31.1%.

Block PRL15 contains the two major discoveries of Elk and
Antelope. A program to delineate these discoveries is currently
underway with the drilling of two wells, the first of which started in
October 2014, and the second of which started in December 2014.
TOTAL has also launched pre-development studies of the Elk and
Antelope fields, including the construction of an onshore gas
liquefaction plant.

In 2012, TOTAL acquired a 40% stake in the PPL244 offshore
license, and secured options to acquire 40% in the PPL234
offshore license, 50% in the PRL10 offshore license and 35%
in the PPL338 and PPL339 onshore licenses.

— On the offshore PPL244 license, two exploration wells were
drilled in 2013.

— The PPL234 option has not been exercised and the license
expired in July 2014.

— On the onshore PPL338 and PPL339 licenses, a 2D seismic
survey was conducted in 2013. A gradiometer survey was
performed on the onshore PPL3339 license. The option related to
the onshore PPL838 license that expired in March 2014 was not
exercised due to the minimal geological interest on the license.

In the Philippines, TOTAL has held since 2012 a 75% stake in the
SC856 license located in the deep offshore of the southern Sulu Sea.
Following interpretation of the data from a seismic campaign in 2013,
TOTAL and its partner have decided to drill an exploration well on
the block. In October 2014, TOTAL became the operator of the block.

In Thailand, the Group’s production in 2014 was 60 kboe/d
compared with 63 kboe/d in 2013 and 55 kboe/d in 2012.

This production comes from the Bongkot (33.33%) offshore gas
and condensate field. PTT purchases all of the natural gas and
condensate production from this field.

— In the northern portion of the Bongkot field, new investments are
in progress to maintain plateau and meet gas demand:

- phase 3L (two wellhead platforms) was approved in 2012 and
commenced production in 2014;

- phase 3 m (four wellhead platforms) was approved in 2013;
and

- phase 3N (three wellhead platforms) was approved in 2014.

— The southern portion of the field (Greater Bongkot South) is also
being developed in several phases. This development is
designed to include a processing platform, a living-quarters
platform and thirteen production platforms:

- phase 4A (six wellhead platforms) commenced production
in 2012;

- phase 4B (four wellhead platforms) commenced production
in 2014; and

- phase 4C (three wellhead platforms) is under development.

Exploration on these licenses is ongoing with wells drilled annually
(two in 2014).

In Vietnam, the Group no longer holds any exploration interests
following the sale in 2013 of its stake in offshore Block 15-1/05
(35%).

2.1.7.5. Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)

In 2014, TOTAL’s production in the CIS was 249 kboe/d,
representing 12% of the Group’s total production, compared
with 227 kboe/d in 2013 and 195 kboe/d in 2012.

In Azerbaijan, where TOTAL has been present since 1996, production,
coming entirely from the Shah Deniz field, was 14 kboe/d in 2014
compared with 20 kboe/d in 2013 and 16 kboe/d in 2012.

— In August 2014, TOTAL sold its stake in the Shah Deniz field
(10%) as well as its 10% stake in the pipeline held by South
Caucasus Pipeline Company (SCPC).

— In September 2014, the Group sold its 10% stake in the Trans
Adriatic Pipeline (TAP).

— TOTAL holds a 5% interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC)
pipeline.

TOTAL is the operator for the exploration phase of the Absheron
Block (40%) in the Caspian Sea, on which a discovery and
commercial declaration was filed in 2012. The development plan for
the field is currently being prepared.

In Kazakhstan, TOTAL has been active since 1992 in the North
Caspian license (16.81%), which covers the Kashagan field.

First phase production from Kashagan(300 kb/d) started in
September 2013 and was halted in October, 2013 due to leaks
detected on the gas export pipeline. Following investigations
carried out by the consortium, a refurbishment plan for the pipelines
was approved. The two oil and gas export pipelines will be replaced
over 99 km.

In February 2015, TOTAL sold 23.9% of its 75% interest in the
Northern and Southern Nurmunai onshore exploration blocks,
located in the southwest of the country. The drilling of a well started
at the end of February 2015 on Northern Nurmunai Block.

In Russia, where TOTAL has had operations since 1991 and
where, as of December 31, 2014, the Group held 19% of its proved
reserves, the Group’s production in 2014 was 235 kboe/d
compared with 207 kboe/d in 2013 and 179 kboe/d in 2012. This
production comes from the Kharyaga field and from TOTAL's stake
in the Russian company OAO Novatek (18.24%)("), which is listed in
Moscow and London (hereafter, “Novatek”). In 2014, international
economic sanctions related to the situation in Ukraine were
imposed by the United States, the EU and other countries. TOTAL
complies with sanctions applicable to its activities. For additional
information, refer to point 3.9.1.3. of chapter 4 (Risk factors).

— On the Kharyaga field (40%, operator), the development of
phases 3 and 4 is ongoing

— In addition to its shareholding in Novatek, TOTAL currently
participates via a direct stake in two projects:

- Termokarstovoye(onshore gas and condensate field located in
the Yamalo-Nenets district): The development and production
license for the Termokarstovoye field is owned by ZAO Terneftegas,
a joint venture between Novatek (51%) and TOTAL (49%).
Development of the field started in late 2011 (estimated
capacity of 65 kboe/d).

— Yamal LNG: Launched in December 2018, the aim of this project
is the development of the onshore South Tambey field (gas and
condensate) located in the Yamal Peninsula via the construction
of a three-train LNG liquefaction plant with a capacity of 16.5 Mt/y.
In order to comply with international economic sanctions, the
financing plan for the Yamal LNG project is being reviewed, and
the project's partners are engaged in efforts to develop a
financing plan in line with the applicable regulations. In parallel,
the development of the project is progressing in a satisfactory
manner. The OAO Yamal LNG company is jointly owned by
Novatek (60%), Total E&P Yamal (20%) and, since January 2014,
CNODC (20%), a subsidiary of CNPC.

In May 2014, TOTAL signed a strategic cooperation agreement
with OAO LUKOIL in order to develop shale oil resources in the
Bazhenov basin, located in the province of Kanthy Mansiysk.

In addition to the licenses covered by this agreement, TOTAL
acquired six new licenses in the basin in 2014. The international
economic sanctions imposed in the summer of 2014 have led the
partners to put this project on hold.

In January 2014, Novatek increased its stake in the Severenergia
company by acquiring ENI’s shares through Arcticgaz (50/50 joint
venture between Novatek and Gazpromneft). In December 2013,
Novatek exchanged its interest held in Sibneftegas for all of
Rosneft’s interests in Severenergia in which it now has a 54.9%
stake. Novatek has held a 50% stake in the company ZAO Nortgaz
since June 2013.

In Tajikistan, TOTAL launched its activities in the country by
acquiring a 33.3% stake in the Bokhtar Block in the first half of
2013. Environmental and societal studies were carried out in 2014.
A 2D seismic campaign covering 800 km started in 2014.

2.1.7.6. Europe

In 2014, TOTAL’s production in Europe was 364 kboe/d,
representing 17% of the Group’s total production, compared
with 392 kboe/d in 2013 and 427 kboe/d in 2012.

In Bulgaria, the Khan Asparuh license, which covers 14,220 km? in
the Black Sea, was awarded to TOTAL in 2012. In March 2013,
TOTAL sold 60% of its stake, retaining a 40% interest. A 2D and 3D
seismic survey was performed from June 2013 to January 2014
and the data is currently being processed and interpreted. TOTAL
became the operator of the block in April 2014.

In Cyprus, TOTAL has been present since 2013 in the deep
offshore exploration Block 10 (100%, operator) and Block 11
(100%, operator) located southwest of the country. Following a 3D
seismic survey carried out on Block 11 in 2013, a 2D seismic
survey on Block 10 was conducted in February 2014.

In Denmark, TOTAL has since 2010 held an 80% stake and
operated the 1/10 (Nordjylland) and 2/10 (Nordsjaelland) licenses.
These onshore licenses, whose shale gas potential continues to be
assessed, cover areas of 3,000 km? and 2,300 km?, respectively.

Following geoscience surveys on license 1/10 in 2011, the decision
was made to drill a well.

On license 2/10, a gravimetric survey was completed in 2013.

In France, the Group’s production in 2014 was 2 kboe/d compared
with 9 kboe/d in 2013 and 13 kboe/d in 2012.

In October 2013, TOTAL ended commercial gas operations on
Lacq, which had begun in 1957. The transfer of the Lacq
concession was approved by French authorities in October 2014.

On the Lacq field, the CO, capture, injection and storage pilot
commissioned in 2010 ended in 2013.

The Montelimar exclusive exploration license awarded to TOTAL in
2010 to assess, in particular, the shale gas potential of the area,
was abrogated by the government in October 2011. This revocation
stemmed from the law of July 13, 2011, prohibiting the exploration
and extraction of hydrocarbons by drilling followed by hydraulic
fracturing. An appeal filed in December 2011 with the administrative
court requesting that the judge cancel the revocation of the license
is pending.

In Italy, TOTAL holds a stake in two exploration licenses and in the
Tempa Rossa field (60%, operator), discovered in 1989 and located
on the Gorgoglione concession (Basilicate region). The final investment
decision for Tempa Rossa was made in July 2012 and development
is ongoing. The Gorgoglione well was tested in 2012 and confirmed
the results obtained from the other wells. A sidetrack was drilled at
the TR-2 well and another started in June 2014 on the TR-1 well.

In 2013, TOTAL sold 25% of its 75% stake in Tempa Rossa,
thereby reducing its stake to 50%.

In Norway, where the Group has had operations since 1965,
TOTAL has equity stakes in 96 production licenses on the Norwegian
maritime continental shelf, 29 of which it operates. In 2014, the
Group’s production was 242 kboe/d, compared to 243 kboe/d in
2013 and 275 kboe/d in 2012. The decrease in production between

In the Norwegian North Sea, the most substantial contribution to
the Group’s production, comes from the non-operated Greater
Ekofisk Area (Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla, etc.).

In the southern Norwegian North Sea:

In the Greater Ekofisk Area, the Group owns a 39.9% stake in
the Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields. Production started in October 2013
at Ekofisk South, and in January 2015 at Eldfisk II (capacity of

70 kboe/d each).

In the central part of the Norwegian North Sea:
The development of the Gina Krog field (80%) located north of
Sleipner was approved in 2013.

In the northern part of the Norwegian North Sea:

The Islay field (100%, operator) started production in 2012.
This field extends on each side of the Norwegian/UK border
and the Group's interest in the Norwegian part is 5.51%.

The Stjerne field, located on license PL104 (14.7%), and the
Visund South field, located on license PL120 (7.7%), were put
into production in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

On license PL120 (7.7%), the fast-track development of Visund
North allowed production to start in 2013.

On the Greater Hild Area (51%, operator), the Martin Linge
development (capacity of 80 kboe/d) was approved by the
authorities in 2012.

In 2013, the authorities approved the Oseberg Delta
phase 2 project (14.7%), located on production licenses
PL104 and PL79. The Oseberg East TSV project (14.7%)
was approved in 2014.

— In the Norwegian Sea, the Haltenbanken area includes the
Tyrihans (23.2%), Mikkel (7.7%) and Kristin (6%) fields, as well as
the Asgard field (7.7%) and its satellites.

The Norwegian authorities approved the Asgard sub-sea
compression project in 2012. The main contracts have all been
signed and various components were installed during the
summer of 2014.

The Polarled project (5.11%), approved in 2012, involves the
installation of a 481 km long pipeline from the Aasta Hansen field
to the Nyhamna terminal, as well as expansion of the terminal.

— In the Barents Sea, a project intended to improve the performance
of the Snghvit gas liquefaction plant (18.4%, 4.2 Mt/y capacity)
was launched in 2012. The plant is supplied with gas from the
Snohvit, Albatross and Askeladd fields.

Several exploration wells were drilled on a number of licenses
during the 2012-14 period with discoveries on Helene (PL120,
11%) and Trell (PL102G, 40%, operator) in 2014, on Smorbukk
North (PL479, 7.68%) and Rhea (PL120, 7.68%) in 2013, as well as
on Garantiana (PL554, 40%, operator) and King Lear (PL146 and
333, 22.2%) in 2012. In 2014, the well drilled on Garantiana
enabled an increase in estimated oil volumes.

In addition, the Group continues to optimize its portfolio in Norway
by obtaining new licenses and divesting a number of non-strategic
assets. To this end, in October 2014, TOTAL concluded an
agreement to sell an 8% stake in the Gina Krog field, thereby
reducing its stake to 30%, and all of its interests in the Vilje
(24.24%), Vale (24.24%) and Morvin (6%) fields. The transaction
was approved by the Norwegian authorities in December 2014.

In the Netherlands, TOTAL has conducted natural gas exploration
and production operations since 1964 and currently holds interests
in twenty-four offshore production licenses, including twenty that it
operates, and two offshore exploration licenses, E17c (16.92%)
and K1c (30%). In 2014, the Group’s production was 31 kboe/d
compared with 35 kboe/d in 2013 and 33 kboe/d in 2012.

— In September 2014, the Dutch authorities awarded the F12
exploration Block to TOTAL.

— Following the acquisition of additional stakes in 2013, TOTAL
now holds a 50% stake in Block K5b and a 60% stake in Blocks
K1b/K2a and K2c. TOTAL is the operator of these blocks.

— A3D seismic survey of several offshore licenses covering an area
of 3,500 km? was conducted in 2012.

— In August 2013, the K4-Z development project (50%, operator)
started production.

In Poland, at the beginning of 2012, TOTAL signed an agreement
to acquire a 49% stake in the Chelm and Werbkowice exploration
concessions in order to assess their shale gas potential.

In February 2014, the licenses were relinquished, and since then
the Group no longer holds any exploration interests in the country.

In the United Kingdom, where TOTAL has had operations since
1962, the Group’s production was 89 kboe/d in 2014 compared
with 105 kboe/d in 2013 and 106 kboe/d in 2012. About 90% of
production comes from operated fields located in two main zones:
the Alwyn zone in the northern North Sea, and the Elgin/Franklin
zone in the Central Graben.

— In the Alwyn zone (100%), the start-up of satellite fields or new
reservoir compartments partially compensated for the natural
decline in production. The N54 and N53 wells were put into
production in 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, the N55
well, which was drilled in 2012 in the Brent South West panel,
was put into production in the second quarter of 2014 and the
N56 well (Alwyn Statfjord) in the third quarter of 2014.

On the Dunbar field (100%), a new development phase (Dunbar
phase IV) including three well work-overs and the drilling of six new
wells is underway.

The Islay field (100%, operator) was put into production in 2012.
This field extends on either side of the border between the United
Kingdom (94.49%) and Norway (5.51%). Production from the field
is processed on the Alwyn North platform.

— In Central Graben, TOTAL holds stakes in the Elgin, Franklin and
West Franklin fields (46.2%, operator). Production at the Elgin,
Franklin and West Franklin fields was stopped following a gas
leak on the Elgin field in March 2012. In May 2012, the G4 well
was definitively secured. Production in the Elgin/Franklin area
resumed in March 2013 following the approval of the safety case
by the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE). A redevelopment
project involving the drilling of five new infill wells on Elgin and
Franklin started in July 2013.

In 2014, TOTAL acquired an additional interest (9.5%) in the
Glenelg field, thereby increasing its interest from 49.5% to 58.7%.

In addition, the West Franklin Phase II development project
continued with the start-up of production of the first well in
January 2015.

— In addition to Alwyn and the Central Graben, a third hub, West of
Shetland, is under development. This hub includes the Laggan
and Tormore fields (80%, operator) and the P967 license (50%,
operator), which includes the Tobermory gas discovery.
Production on the Laggan and Tormore fields is expected to start
in 2015 with an expected capacity of 90 kboe/d.

Close to Laggan and Tormore, the development of the Edradour
East (80%, operator) gas and condensate discovery was
sanctioned in 2012. A second well (Spinnaker), near the Edradour
East discovery, was drilled in early 2014.

In July 2014, TOTAL acquired an 80% stake and the operatorship
in the Glenlivet field located north of Edradour. The proximity of the
two fields resulted in reduced development costs, which enabled
the launch of a joint development.

In addition, TOTAL purchased an additional 5% stake in the
Edradour field in 2014 and now holds 80% of the four fields
currently under development: Laggan, Tormore, Edradour and
Glenlivet.

TOTAL also holds a stake in three non-operated fields: Bruce
(43.25%), Keith (25%), and Markham (7.35%). The Group’s stakes
in other non-operated fields (Seymour, Alba, Armada, Maria, Moira,
Mungo/Monan and Everest) were divested in 2012.

TOTAL was awarded six new licenses in the 28" Round in
November 2014. Four of these licenses are in the West of Shetland
area, one in the northern North Sea and one non-operated in the
Central Graben.

In early 2014, TOTAL acquired a 40% stake in two onshore shale
gas exploration and production licenses (PEDL 139 and 140)
located in the Gainsborough Trough basin of the East Midlands,
and signed an agreement enabling the Group to acquire a 50%
stake in the PEDL 209 license located in the same area. A 70 km?
3D survey campaign was carried out in March and April 2014.

2.1.7.7. Middle East

In 2014, TOTAL’s production in the Middle East was 391 kboe/d,
representing 18% of the Group’s total production, compared
with 536 kboe/d in 2013 and 493 kboe/d in 2012.

In the United Arab Emirates, where TOTAL has had operations
since 1939, the Group’s production was 127 kboe/d in 2014
compared with 260 kboe/d in 2013 and 246 kboe/d in 2012.

The decrease in production in 2014 was due to the expiry

of the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore oil Operations (ADCO)
license in January 2014, in which TOTAL held a 9.5% interest.

In January 2015, TOTAL signed an agreement granting it a 10%
participation as from January 1, 2015 in the new ADCO concession
for 40 years. This concession covers the fifteen main onshore fields
of Abu Dhabi and represents more than half of the Emirate’s
production.

TOTAL holds a 75% stake (operator) in the Abu Al Bukhoosh field
and a 13.3% stake in Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company
(ADMA-OPCO), which operates two fields offshore Abu Dhabi.
TOTAL also holds a 15% stake in Abu Dhabi Gas Industries
(GASCO), which produces NGL and condensates from the
associated gas produced by ADCO as well as from the gas and
condensates produced by ADMA-OPCO. In addition, TOTAL holds
stakes of 5% in Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (ADGAS),


--- Page 29 ---

which processes the associated gas produced by ADMA-OPCO in
order to produce LNG, NGL and condensates, and 5% in National
Gas Shipping Company (NGSCO), which owns eight LNG tankers
and exports the LNG produced by ADGAS.

The Group holds a 24.5% stake in Dolphin Energy Ltd. in
partnership with Mubadala, a company owned by the government
of Abu Dhabi, in order to market gas produced in Qatar primarily to
the United Arab Emirates.

The Group also owns 33.33% of Ruwais Fertilizer Industries
(FERTIL), which produces urea. The FERTIL 2 project commenced
operations in July 2013, enabling FERTIL to more than double its
production capacity to 2 Mt/y.

In Iraq, the Group’s production in 2014 was 12 kboe/d compared
with 7 kboe/d in 2013 and 6 kboe/d in 2012.

On the Halfaya field in Missan province, following the completion

of a negotiation in October 2014, TOTAL's stake increased from
18.75% to 22.5% in the consortium that was awarded the
development and production contract. Production of phase 1 of the
project started in June 2012 and phase 2 started in August 2014,
enabling production to reach 200 kb/d in the second half of 2014.

In early 2014,TOTAL increased its stake from 35% to 80% and
became operator of the Safen Block (424 km?) located northwest
of Erbil in the Kurdistan region. A 2D seismic survey of 275 km was
conducted in 2014.

In early 2013, TOTAL acquired an 80% stake and became operator
of the Baranan exploration Block (729 km?2), southeast of Sulaymaniyah,
in the Kurdistan region. A 2D seismic survey of 213 km was
completed in January 2014.

Since 2012, TOTAL has held a 35% stake in the Harir exploration
Block (705 km?) located northeast of Erbil, as well as a 20% stake
in the Taza Block (505 km?), located southwest of Sulaymaniyah.
Following three exploration wells in 2013 that led to two discoveries
on the Taza Block and on the Harir Block (Mirawa), an exploration
well was drilled in 2014 resulting in the Jisik discovery.

In Iran, the Group has had no production since 2010. For additional
information, refer to point 3.9. of chapter 4 (Risk factors).

In Oman, the Group's production in 2014 was 36 kboe/d, stable
compared with 2013 and 2012. TOTAL primarily produces oil on
Block 6 (4%)"" as well as on Block 53 (2%). The Group also
produces LNG through its stake in the Oman LNG (5.54%)/Qalhat
LNG (2.04%)'*) liquefaction plant, which has a capacity of 10.5 Mt/y.
In December 2013, TOTAL obtained the license for ultra-deep
offshore Block 41, in which a seabed core drilling campaign was
carried out.

In Qatar, where TOTAL has had operations since 1936, the Group’s
production was 132 kboe/d in 2014 compared with 137 kboe/d in
2013 and 139 kboe/d in 2012.

The Group operates the Al Khalij field and participates in the
production, processing and export of gas from the North Field
through its stakes in the Qatargas 1 and Qatargas 2 Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) plants and in Dolphin Energy.

Al Khalij (40%, operator): in 2012, TOTAL and state-owned Qatar
Petroleum signed a new agreement extending their partnership
on the Al Khalij field for an additional 25-year period as of
February 1, 2014. According to the terms of this contract,
TOTAL will continue to be the operator (40%) alongside Qatar
Petroleum (60%).

— Qatargas 2 (16.7%): the production capacity of train 5 of
Qatargas 2 is 8 Mt/y. TOTAL offtakes part of the LNG produced
under the 2006 contracts which provide for the purchase of
5.2 Mt/y of LNG by the Group. In addition, the Group holds a
stake in the Qatargas 1 liquefaction plant (10%) as well as a
stake in the corresponding upstream block NFB (20%).

— Dolphin Energy (24.5%): the production contract for the Dolphin
gas project, signed in 2001 with Qatar Petroleum, provides for
the sale of 2 Bcf/d of gas from the North Field for a 25-year period.
The gas is processed in the Dolphin plant in Ras Laffan and
exported to the United Arab Emirates through a 360 km gas pipeline.

— The Group became a partner in the offshore BC exploration
license (25%) in 2011. Drilling of the first exploration well started
in May 2014 and was completed in December 2014.

In Syria, TOTAL has a 100% stake in the Deir Ez Zor license, which
is operated by the joint venture company DEZPC in which TOTAL
and the state-owned company SPC each have a 50% share.
TOTAL also holds the Tabiyeh contract, which came into effect in
2009. The Group has had no production in the country since
December 2011, when TOTAL suspended its hydrocarbon
production activities in Syria in compliance with the European
Union's regulations regarding this country. For additional
information, refer to point 3.9. of chapter 4 (Risk factors).

In Yemen, where TOTAL has had operations since 1987,
the Group’s production was 84 kboe/d in 2014 compared
with 95 kboe/d in 2013 and 65 kboe/d in 2012.

The security situation in Yemen remains unstable, however this had
only a marginal effect on the production from the Group's assets in
2014. Security measures are regularly reviewed in view of the
evolving risks.

TOTAL owns a 39.62% stake in the Yemen LNG liquefaction plant
(capacity of 6.7 Mt/y), which is located in Balhaf on the country’s
southern coast. This plant is supplied with the gas produced on
Block 18, located near Marib in the center of the country, and
connected via a 320 km gas pipeline. Rockets were launched
towards the Balhaf plant in December 2013, January 2014 and
December 2014. However, production was not impacted and
security measures have been strengthened.

TOTAL also has stakes in two oil blocks: Block 10 East Shabwa
license (28.57%, operator) in the Masila basin and Block 5 Jannah
license (15%) in the Marib basin.

TOTAL owns stakes in five onshore exploration licenses: Block 69
(40%, the exploration period has expired and the block is in the

process of being relinquished), Block 71 (40%), Block 70 (50.1%,
operator), Block 72 (36%, operator), and Block 3 (40%, operator).

(1) TOTAL holds an indirect 4% stake in Petroleum Development Oman LLC, operator of Block 6 via its 10% stake in Private Oil Holdings Oman Ltd.

2.2. Gas & Power

Gas & Power's primary objective is to contribute to the growth of
the Group by ensuring sales outlets for its current and future natural
gas reserves and production.

In order to optimize these gas resources, particularly Liquefied Natural
Gas (LNG), Gas & Power's activities include the trading and marketing
of natural gas, LNG, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity
as well as shipping. Gas & Power also has stakes in infrastructure
companies (re-gasification terminals, natural gas transport and
storage, power plants) necessary to implement its strategy.

2.2.1. Liquefied Natural Gas

A pioneer in the LNG industry, TOTAL today is one of the world’s
leading players" in the sector and has sound and diversified
positions both in the upstream and downstream portions of the
LNG chain. LNG development is a key element of the Group’s
strategy, with TOTAL strengthening its positions in most major
production zones and markets.

Through its stakes in liquefaction plants? located in Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates, Oman, Nigeria, Norway, Yemen and Angola and its
gas supply agreement with the Bontang LNG plant in Indonesia,
TOTAL markets LNG in all global markets. The share of LNG
production sold by TOTAL in 2014 remained stable at 12.2 Mt,
(12.3 Mt in 2013). The Group's upcoming liquefaction projects, in
particular in Australia and Russia, are aimed at increasing TOTAL’s
share of LNG sold over the coming years.

Gas & Power is responsible for LNG operations downstream from
liquefaction plants. It is in charge of marketing LNG on behalf of
Exploration & Production and developing the Group’s downstream
LNG portfolio for its trading, marketing and transport operations as
well as re-gasification terminals.

2.2.1.1. Long-term Group LNG purchases

TOTAL acquires long-term LNG volumes most frequently from
liquefaction plants in which the Group holds a stake. These volumes
support the expansion of the Group’s worldwide LNG portfolio.

In Nigeria, as part of the Nigeria LNG project in which the Group
has a 15% interest, TOTAL signed an LNG purchase agreement,
initially intended for deliveries to the United States and Europe,
for 1.17 Mt/y over a 20-year period starting in 2009.

TOTAL also holds a 20.48% stake in the Brass LNG project, on
which studies are ongoing for a gas liquefaction plant with two LNG
trains with a capacity of about 4.5 Mt/y each. In 2006, TOTAL
signed a preliminary agreement with Brass LNG Ltd setting forth

the principal terms of an LNG purchase agreement for 2.15 Mt/y.
This purchase agreement is subject to the final investment decision
for the project.

In Norway, as part of the Snahvit project, in which the Group holds
an 18.4% stake, TOTAL signed in 2004 a purchase agreement for
0.78 Mt/y of LNG over a 20-year period primarily intended for North
America and Europe. LNG deliveries started in 2007.

In Qatar, TOTAL signed purchase agreements in 2006 for up to
5.2 Mt/y of LNG from train 5 (16.7%) of Qatargas 2 over a 25-year

(1) Company data, based on upstream and downstream LNG portfolios in 2014.

period. This LNG was initially marketed in France, the United Kingdom
and the United States. LNG deliveries started in 2009.

In Yemen, TOTAL signed a contract with Yemen LNG Ltd (39.62%)
in 2005 to purchase 2 Mt/y of LNG over a 20-year period, initially
intended for delivery to the United States and Europe. LNG deliveries
started in 2009.

Since 2009, a growing part of the volume purchased by the Group
pursuant to its long-term contracts related to the LNG projects
mentioned above has been diverted to more buoyant Asian markets.

The new LNG sources described below are expected to support
the growth of the Group’s LNG portfolio.

In Australia, TOTAL increased its stake in the Ichthys LNG project
in early 2013 from 24% to 30%. Launched in early 2012, this project
involves the construction of two LNG trains, each with a capacity of
4.2 Mt/y. In addition, TOTAL signed in 2011 an LNG purchase
agreement amounting to 0.9 Mt/y over a 15-year period. The start
of production is scheduled for the end of 2016 and the first LNG
deliveries to long-term customers are expected to start in 2017.

In Russia, TOTAL owns a 20% direct stake in Yamal LNG, which

is developing the South Tambey gas and condensates field and
building a gas liquefaction plant with three trains and an LNG
production capacity of 16.5 Mt/y. The final investment decision was
made in December 2013. Concurrently, TOTAL signed two LNG
purchase agreements with the project, amounting respectively to 3 Mt/y
over a 23-year period and 1 Mt/y over a 15-year period.

In the United States, TOTAL entered into an agreement in 2012
with Kogas (Korea Gas Corporation) for the purchase of 0.7 Mt/y
of LNG over a 20-year period from train 3 of the Sabine Pass gas
terminal in Louisiana. LNG deliveries are expected to start in 2017.
At the same time, TOTAL also entered into an agreement with
Sabine Pass Liquefaction LLC for the purchase of 2 Mt/y of LVG
over a 20-year period from train 5 of the Sabine Pass terminal. LNG
deliveries will begin on the date on which train 5 is commissioned,
which is scheduled for 2019. This agreement is conditional on,
among other things, the final investment decision for the project
and the obtaining of export and construction permits by Sabine
Pass Liquefaction LLC, the entity which owns and operates the
terminal. Finally, TOTAL concluded a contract with Mitsui in 2014
for the purchase of 0.5 Mt/y of LNG from the Cameron gas terminal
in Louisiana, over a 10-year period starting from the date of
commissioning of train 1, scheduled for 2018.

2.2.1.2. Long-term Group LNG sales

TOTAL has signed agreements for the sale of LNG from the
Group's global LNG portfolio:

In Spain, TOTAL signed an LNG sales agreement with Cepsa Gas
Comercializadora (CGC). Under this agreement, TOTAL supplies
0.74 Mt/y to CGC over a 17-year period starting from 2006.

In China, TOTAL signed an LNG sales agreement with China
National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Under this agreement,
which became effective in 2010, TOTAL supplies up to 1 Mt/y of
LNG to CNOOC over a 15-year period.


--- Page 34 ---

In South Korea, TOTAL signed an LNG sales agreement in 2011
with Kogas. Under this agreement, TOTAL will deliver up to 2 Mt/y
of LNG to Kogas between 2014 and 2031.

In Japan, TOTAL signed an LNG sales agreement in 2011 with Inpex.
Under this agreement, TOTAL will deliver up to 0.2 Mt/y of LNG to
Inpex over a 15-year period. Deliveries are expected to start in 2017.

In Singapore, TOTAL signed an LNG sales agreement in 2014 with
Pavilion. Under this agreement, TOTAL will supply up to 0.7 Mt/y of
LNG to Pavilion from 2018 over a 10-year period, as well as several
cargoes before 2018. This agreement is subject to Pavilion obtaining
an import license.

2.2.1.3. LNG shipping

With regard to LNG transport operations, TOTAL has been using
since 2006 a 145,000 m® capacity LNG tanker, the Arctic Lady,
under a long-term charter, to ship its share of production from the
Snohvit liquefaction plant in Norway. In late 2011, TOTAL signed a
second long-term contract for the chartering of a 165,000 m8 LNG
tanker, the Meridian Spirit, in order to strengthen its transport
capacities with regard to its purchase commitments in Norway,

as mentioned above.

The Group continues to develop its fleet. TOTAL signed a long-term
charter agreement in April 2013 in this regard with SK Shipping and
Marubeni for two 180,000 m$ LNG tankers. The vessels will serve in
fulfilling the purchase agreements of Total Gas & Power, including
commitments relating to the Ichthys LNG project in Australia

and the Sabine Pass project in the United States. These tankers,
scheduled for delivery in 2017, will be among the largest to navigate
the Panama Canal following the canal’s expansion due to be
completed in 2015.

As of December 31, 2013, the Group held a 30% stake in
Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT), which focuses mainly on the
design and engineering of membrane cryogenic tanks for LNG
tankers. Since then, TOTAL has sold its entire stake through the
initial public offering (IPO) of GTT’s shares on Euronext Paris at the
end of February 2014 and through a direct sale agreement in
December 2014.

2.2.2. Trading

In 2014, TOTAL continued to pursue its strategy of developing
operations downstream from natural gas and LNG production.
The aim of this strategy is to optimize access for the Group’s
current and future production to markets with long-term contracts
and to markets open to international competition (with short-term
contracts and spot sales). In the context of deregulated markets,
which allow customers to access suppliers more freely, in turn
leading to marketing arrangements that are more flexible than
traditional long-term contracts, TOTAL is developing trading,
marketing and logistics businesses to market its natural gas and
LNG production directly to customers.

The Group also has operations in electricity trading and the marketing
of LPG and coal. Furthermore, TOTAL has marketed the petcoke
produced at the Port Arthur refinery in the United States since 2011
and a part of the petcoke produced at the Jubail refinery in Saudi
Arabia since 2014.

Gas & Power's trading teams, which are located in London,
Houston, Geneva and Singapore, conduct most of their business

through the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries Total Gas & Power,
Total Gas & Power North America and Total Gas & Power Asia.

2.2.2.1. Gas and electricity

TOTAL's gas and electricity trading operations in Europe and North
America sell the Group's production, supply its gas marketing
subsidiaries and support other activities of the Group.

In Europe, TOTAL marketed 911 Bcf (25.8 Bm’) of natural gas in
2014 compared to 1,194 Bef (33.8 Bm’) in 2013 and 1,488 Bcf
(42.1 Bm*) in 2012, including approximately 12.1% from its own
production in 2014. TOTAL also supplied 44.8 TWh of electricity
primarily from external resources in 2014, compared to 53.0 TWh
in 2013 and 53.3 TWh in 2012.

In North America, TOTAL marketed 593 Bcf (16.8 Bm®) of natural
gas from its own production or external resources in 2014, compared
to 938 Bcf (26.6 Bm’) in 2013 and 1,256 Bef (86 Bm®) in 2012.

2.2.2.2. LNG

TOTAL has LNG trading operations through spot sales and fixed-term
contracts as described in section 2.2.1. of this chapter. Major
purchase and sale agreements have significantly helped develop
the Group’s LNG marketing operations, particularly in Asia’s most
buoyant markets: China, India, Japan, and South Korea. This spot
and fixed-term LNG portfolio allows TOTAL to supply gas to its
main customers worldwide, while retaining a sufficient degree of
flexibility to react to market opportunities.

In 2014, TOTAL purchased 87 contractual cargoes from Qatar,
Yemen, Nigeria and Norway and 7 spot cargoes from France,
Trinidad & Tobago and Nigeria, compared to, respectively, 89 and
9 in 2013 and 87 and 8 in 2012.

2.2.2.3. LPG

TOTAL traded and sold approximately 5.5 Mt of LPG (butane and
propane) worldwide in 2014, compared to 5.6 Mt in 2013 and 6 Mt
in 2012. Approximately 20% of these quantities came from fields or
refineries operated by the Group. LPG trading involved the use of
10 time charters, 290 voyages were necessary in 2014 to transport
the negotiated quantities, of which 195 voyages were by TOTAL
time charters, and 95 by spot charters.

2.2.2.4. Coal

TOTAL marketed 8.5 Mt of coal on the international market in 2014
the same quantity as in both 2013 and 2012. More than 70% of
this coal came from South Africa. Approximately 70% of the volume
was sold in Asia, where coal is used primarily to generate electricity.
The remaining volume was marketed primarily in Europe.

2.2.2.5. Petcoke

TOTAL began to market the petcoke produced by the coker at the
Port Arthur refinery in the United States in 2011. Approximately
1.3 Mt of petcoke was sold on the international market in 2014,
compared to 1.2 Mt in 2013 and 1.1 Mt in 2012, to cement plants
and electricity producers mainly in India, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and
other Latin American countries.

In 2014, TOTAL began to market the petcoke produced by the
Jubail refinery in Saudi Arabia. Approximately 100 kt was sold
mainly in the Asian market.


--- Page 35 ---

2.2.3. Marketing

To consolidate its position throughout the value chain and to
leverage the synergies of the Group’s other activities, TOTAL has
been developing an activity to market gas as well as electricity and
coal to end consumers in the United Kingdom, France, Spain,
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.

In the United Kingdom, TOTAL markets gas and electricity to the
industrial and commercial segments through its subsidiary Total
Gas & Power Ltd. In 2014, volumes of gas sold amounted to 135 Bef
(3.8 Bm’), compared to 142 Bcf (4.0 Bm’) in 2013 and 146 Bcf
(4.2 Bm®) in 2012. Sales of electricity totaled approximately 5.3 TWh
in 2014, compared to 4.7 TWh in 2013 and 3.9 TWh in 2012.

In France, TOTAL markets natural gas through its subsidiary Total
Energie Gaz (TEGAZ), the overall sales of which were 95 Bef (2.7 Bm®)
in 2014, compared to 141 Bef (4.0 Bm*) in 2013 and 176 Bef

(5.0 Bm’) in 2012. This decrease is a consequence of TEGAZ’s
strategic repositioning on the SME market due to deteriorating
margins and a more stringent regulatory environment. The Group
also markets coal to its French customers through its subsidiary
CDF Energie, with sales of approximately 0.7 Mt in 2014,
compared to 0.81 Mt in 2013 and 0.97 Mt in 2012.

In Spain, TOTAL markets natural gas to the industrial and commercial
segments through Cepsa Gas Comercializadora, in which it holds
a 35% stake. In 2014, volumes of gas sold amounted to 94 Bcf
(2.7 Bm*), compared to 101 Bef (2.9 Bm’) in 2013 and 2012.

In Germany, Total Energie Gas GmbH, TOTAL’s marketing subsidiary
created in 2010, marketed 24 Bcf (0.7 Bm®) of gas in 2014 to
industrial and commercial customers, compared to 14 Bef (0.4 Bm’)
in 2013 and 5 Bef (0.15 Bm’) in 2012.

At the end of 2012, the Group enlarged its European marketing
coverage by creating two marketing subsidiaries: Total Gas & Power
in Belgium, and Total Gas & Power Nederland B.V. in the Netherlands.
These two subsidiaries began to market natural gas to industrial
and commercial customers in 2013, whereas the marketing of
electricity has not yet started. The volume of gas supplied in 2014
was not substantial.

The Group also holds stakes in the marketing companies that are
associated with the Altamira and Hazira LNG re-gasification
terminals located in Mexico and India, respectively.

2.2.4. Gas facilities

TOTAL holds stakes in natural gas transport networks, gas storage
facilities (both liquid and gaseous) and LNG re-gasification terminals
downstream from its natural gas and LNG production.

2.2.4.1. Natural gas transport, natural gas
and LPG storage

In France, TOTAL, through its 28.05% direct stake in Géométhane,
owns natural gas storage in a salt cavern in Manosque with a
capacity of 10.5 Bef (0.3 Bm’). A 7 Bcf (0.2 Bm’) increase in
storage capacity is scheduled to be commissioned in 2018.

In South America, TOTAL owns interests in several natural gas
transport companies in Argentina and Brazil. These natural gas
transport companies face a difficult operational and financial
environment in Argentina stemming from the absence of an
increase in transport tariffs and restrictions imposed on gas
exports. GasAndes, a company in which TOTAL held a 56.5%

In India, TOTAL holds a 50% stake in South Asia LPG Limited
(SALPG), a company that operates an LPG import and underground
storage terminal located on the east coast of the country. This cavern,
the first of its kind in India, has a storage capacity of 60 kt. In 2014,
inbound vessels transported 1,069 kt of LPG, compared to 940 kt
in 2013 and 950 kt in 2012.

2.2.4.2. LNG re-gasification

TOTAL has entered into agreements to obtain long-term access to LNG
re-gasification capacity on the three continents that are the largest
consumers of natural gas: North America (United States and
Mexico), Europe (France and the United Kingdom), and Asia (India).
This diversified market presence allows the Group to access new
liquefaction projects by becoming a long-term buyer of a portion of
the LNG produced at these plants, thereby strengthening its LNG
supply portfolio.

In France, TOTAL holds a 27.5% stake in the company Fosmax and
has, through its subsidiary Total Gas & Power Ltd., a re-gasification
capacity of 78 Bcf/y (2.25 Bm*/y). The terminal received 46 vessels
in 2014, compared to 53 in 2013 and 56 in 2012.

In 2011, TOTAL acquired a 9.99% stake in Dunkerque LNG in order
to develop a methane terminal project with a capacity of 459 Bcf/y
(13 Bm*/y). Trade agreements have also been signed that allow
TOTAL to reserve up to 2 Bm*/y of re-gasification capacity over a
20-year period. The project is underway and commissioning of the
terminal is scheduled for the end of 2015.

In the United Kingdom, through its equity interest in the Qatargas
2 project, TOTAL holds an 8.35% stake in the South Hook LNG
re-gasification terminal with a total capacity of 742 Bcf/y (21 Bm?/y)
and an equivalent right of use to the terminal. In 2014, the terminal
re-gasified 67 cargoes, compared to 52 in 2013 and 68 in 2012.

In Mexico, TOTAL has reserved 25% of the capacity of the Altamira
re-gasification terminal, i.e., 59 Bcf/y (1.7 Bm*/y), through its 25%
stake in Gas del Litoral.

In the United States, TOTAL has reserved a re-gasification capacity
of approximately 353 Bcf/y (10 Bm°/y) at the Sabine Pass terminal
in Louisiana over a 20-year period ending in 2029. In 2012, the
Sabine Pass terminal received the authorization to export LNG
from four liquefaction trains, which would involve converting the
re-gasification plants into liquefaction plants in the future.

As a result, TOTAL negotiated a modification to the conditions of
the financial compensation owed to Cheniere, the terminal's
operator, in relation to the commissioning of the successive
liquefaction trains for the reservation of re-gasification capacity.

In India, TOTAL holds a 26% stake in the Hazira terminal, where
the natural gas re-gasification capacity was increased in 2013 to
244 Bcf/y (6.9 Bm*/y). The terminal, located on the west coast of
India in Gujarat state, is a merchant terminal with operations that
cover both LNG re-gasification and gas marketing. Due to the
Indian market's strong prospects for growth, a potential expansion
project is under study to increase the terminal’s capacity to 343 Bef/y
(9.7 Bm?/y).

2.2.5. Electricity generation

In a context of increasing global demand for electricity, TOTAL has
developed expertise in the power generation sector, especially
through cogeneration and combined-cycle power plant projects.

In Abu Dhabi, the Taweelah A1 gas-fired power plant, which is
owned by Gulf Total Tractebel Power Company (20%), combines
electricity generation and water desalination. The plant, in operation
since 2003, currently has a net power generation capacity of 1,600 MW
and a water desalination capacity of 385,000 mé per day. The plant’s
production is sold to Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Company
(ADWEC) as part of a long-term agreement.

In Nigeria, TOTAL holds a stake in the Afam VI power plant through
its 10% interest in the Shell Petroleum Development Company
(SPDC) joint venture. This plant is part of the government's plan

to develop power generation and increase the share of natural gas
production for domestic use.

In Thailand, TOTAL owns 28% of Eastern Power and Electric
Company Ltd, which operates the combined-cycle gas power plant
in Bang Bo with a capacity of 350 MW and has been in operation
since 2008. The plant’s production is sold to the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand under a long-term agreement.

2.2.6. Coal production

For nearly thirty years, TOTAL, through its subsidiary Total Coal
South Africa (TCSA), has produced and exported coal from South
Africa primarily to Europe and Asia. In 2014, TCSA produced 3.3 Mt
of coal.

The South African coal produced by TCSA or bought from third-
parties’ mines is either marketed locally or exported through the
port of Richard’s Bay, in which TCSA holds a 4.8% interest.

In July 2014, TOTAL signed an agreement for the sale of TCSA with
Exxaro, a mining company based in South Africa. The sale is
pending approval of the relevant authorities. This transaction is
expected to be finalized in 2015.

3.1. Refining & Chemicals

Refining & Chemicals includes the Group's refining, petrochemicals
and specialty chemicals businesses. The petrochemicals business
includes base petrochemicals (olefins and aromatics) and polymer
derivatives (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and
hydrocarbon resins). The specialty chemicals business includes
elastomer processing and electroplating chemistry. The volume of
its Refining & Chemicals activities places TOTAL among the top ten
integrated chemical producers in the world".

Against the backdrop of rising worldwide demand for oil and
petrochemicals driven by non-OECD countries and the entry of new
capacities into the market, the strategy of Refining & Chemicals, in
addition to the priority given to safety and environmental protection,
involves:

— adapting production capacity to changes in demand in Europe
by concentrating investments on large integrated platforms;

— consolidating industrial means of production and searching for
opportunities for growth in the United States; and

— strengthening TOTAL's positions in Asia and the Middle East, in
particular to gain access to advantaged oil and gas feedstocks
and to benefit from market growth.

This strategy is underpinned by an effort to differentiate through the
technology used and innovation found in its products and processes,
while pursuing portfolio management to focus on core businesses.

Since 2012, Refining & Chemicals has launched a comprehensive
program to improve operational efficiency and to generate
synergies between its refining and petrochemicals activities.

In particular, four industrial priorities were set: safety, availability

of facilities, cost control, and energy efficiency. These ongoing
action plans, combined with development projects on the major
integrated platforms, perimeter changes and the growth of
specialty chemicals, have already boosted Refining & Chemicals’
results and should continue to improve the profitability of operations
with the goal of making the most of the division’s assets.

In December 2014, TOTAL completed the divestment of its
subsidiary CCP Composites (100%), a player in the composite
resins segment. In June 2013, TOTAL completed the divestment of
its Fertilizers activity (Base Chemicals) in Europe, mainly through the
sale of all of its shares in GPN S.A., a leading producer of nitrogen
fertilizers in France, and in the Belgian company Rosier S.A.2)

On February 2, 2015, TOTAL finalized the divestment of its wholly-
owned subsidiary Bostik, specialized in adhesive chemicals, to the
Arkema group. This divestment follows the offer received in
September 2014. Bostik has approximately 4,900 employees over
forty-eight production sites in the world and its sales were €1.5
billion ($2 billion) in 2014.

(1) Based on publicly available information, production capacities at year-end 2013.

3.1.1. Refining & Petrochemicals

TOTAL's refining capacity was 2,187 kb/d as of December 31,
2014, compared to 2,042 kb/d at year-end 2013 and 2,048 kb/d at
year-end 2012. The Group’s worldwide refined products sales
(including trading operations) in 2014 were 3,769 kb/d, compared
to 3,521 kb/d in 2013 and 3,561 kb/d in 2012.

TOTAL has equity stakes in twenty-one refineries (including nine
operated by companies of the Group), located in Europe, the
United States, the French West Indies, Africa, the Middle East and
China.

The Refining & Chemicals segment manages the refining operations
located in Europe (excluding the TotalErg joint venture in Italy), the
United States, the Middle East and Asia, with a capacity of 2,098
kb/d at year-end 2014 (i.e., 96% of the Group’s total capacity®).

The petrochemicals businesses are located mainly in Europe, the
United States, Qatar, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Most of these
sites are either adjacent or connected by pipelines to Group
refineries. As a result, TOTAL’s petrochemical operations are
integrated within its refining operations.

The year 2014 was marked by the end of the startup period of the
SATORP complex in Saudi Arabia, now fully operational. Through
this project, approved in 2009, the Group holds a stake, alongside
Saudi Aramco, in one of the most competitive

Refining & Petrochemicals platforms in the world.

Moreover, through its equity interest in Samsung Total
Petrochemicals Co. Ltd (50%), which operates the Daesan
petrochemical complex, TOTAL completed the construction of two
new EVA“) and aromatics production units in 2014.

Finally, in Europe, TOTAL continued to develop its major investment
project launched in 2013 on the Antwerp platform in Belgium, and
completed the modernization of the Normandy platform in France with
anew desulphurization unit that started up in August 2014. In
February 2015, the Group announced a plan to adapt and secure
the future of its Lindsey refinery in the United Kingdom.

3.1.1.1. Europe
TOTAL is the largest refiner in Western Europe®.

Western Europe accounts for 79% of the Group's refining
capacity, /.e., 1,736 kb/d at year-end 2014 and year-end 2013
compared to 1,742 kb/d at year-end 2012. The Group operates
eight refineries in Western Europe (one in Antwerp, Belgium, five in
France in Donges, Feyzin, Gonfreville, Grandpuits and La Méde,
one in Immingham in the United Kingdom and one in Leuna,
Germany) and owns stakes in the Schwedt refinery in Germany, the
Zeeland refinery in the Netherlands and the Trecate refinery in Italy
through its interest in TotalErg.

(2) The divestment did not include TOTALS interest in Grande Paroisse S.A., through which TOTAL has retained all liabilities related to the former activities of Grande Paroisse, and in particular

those related to the AZF site in Toulouse.

(3) Earnings related to the refining assets in Africa, the French West Indies and the TotalErg joint venture are reported in the results of the Marketing & Services segment.

The Group’s main petrochemical sites are located in Belgium, in
Antwerp (steam crackers, aromatics, polyethylene) and Feluy
(polyolefins, polystyrene), and in France, in Carling (steam cracker,
aromatics, polyethylene, polystyrene), Feyzin (steam cracker,
aromatics), Gonfreville (steam crackers, aromatics, styrene,
polyolefins, polystyrene) and Lavéra (steam cracker, aromatics,
polypropylene). Western Europe accounts for 50% of the Group's
petrochemicals capacity, /.e., 10,909 kt at year-end 2014 compared
to 10,899 kt at year-end 2013 and 11,803 kt at year-end 2012. The
decrease in 2013 was due essentially to the closure of one steam
cracker in Antwerp.

— In France, the Group owns five refineries and continues to adapt
its refining capacities by shifting the production emphasis to
diesel and improving operational efficiency against the backdrop
of a structural decline in the demand for petroleum products in
Europe and an increase in gasoline surpluses.

The Group implemented its industrial plan intended to
reconfigure the Gonfreville refinery in Normandy, France, between
2009 and 2014 to upgrade the refinery and shift the production
emphasis to diesel. For this purpose, the investments resulted in
reducing the annual distillation capacity to 12 Mt from 16 Mt,
upsizing the hydrocracker unit for heavy diesel cuts and
improving energy efficiency by lowering carbon dioxide
emissions. Most of the new configuration was rolled out at the
beginning of 2013 after a complete shutdown of the refinery. The
project was completed in August 2014 with the startup of a new
diesel desulfurization unit. Lastly, in November 2014, the Group
announced a project to modernize the specialties production
scheme of the Normandy complex, including a decrease in the
base oils production capacity and an investment in the linear
polyethylene (LPE) production line.

At the same time, the project to modernize petrochemical
operations on the Normandy platform was completed in early
2012. This project improved the energy efficiency of the steam
cracker and the high-density polyethylene unit.

In petrochemicals, the Group announced an investment plan in
September 2013 for the Carling platform in Lorraine, France, to
adapt its capacity and restore its competitiveness. The project
provides for the development of new hydrocarbon resin and
polymer production activities and the shutdown of the steam
cracking activity in the second half of 2015.

— In Germany, TOTAL holds equity stakes in the Leuna (100%)
and Schwedt (16.7%)" refineries.

In petrochemicals, in February 2015, the Group acquired the
majority stake in Polyblend, a German manufacturer of polyolefin
compounds used mainly in the automotive industry.

This acquisition will enable synergies to be developped with the
Carling site, located 150 km away.

— In Belgium, the Group announced the launch of a major project
in 2013 to modernize its Antwerp platform. This project consists
of two parts:

- the construction of new conversion units in response to the
shift in demand towards lighter oil products with a very low
sulfur content, and

- the construction of a new unit to convert part of the combustible
gases recovered from the refining process into raw materials for
petrochemical units.

As part of this modernization plan, two of the site’s oldest
production units were shut down: a steam cracker in 2013
and a polyethylene production line in November 2014.

TOTAL built a unit in Feluy, which started up in 2014, that produces
latest-generation expandable polystyrene for the fast-growing
insulation market.

Moreover, in 2012, TOTAL acquired 35% of Fina Antwerp
Olefins, thus becoming the sole owner of Europe’s second
largest base petrochemicals (monomers) production plant?)
renamed Total Olefins Antwerp.

— In the United Kingdom, in February 2015, TOTAL launched a
plan to adapt and secure the future of its Lindsey refinery. In
addition to shutting down one of the two crude distillation units
and associated units, which will reduce its capacity by 5 Mt/y,
the plan entails revamping the conversion block, adapting
logistics operations and simplifying the refinery’s organization.
The initial outlay will be $50 million, followed by an investment of
$220 million over the next five years for maintenance and other
improvements required to comply with changing regulations.

In 2013, TOTAL shut down its 70 kt/y polystyrene production site
at Stalybridge, while continuing its commercial activity for polymers.

— In Italy, TotalErg (49%) holds a 24.45% stake in the Trecate
refinery. The Rome refinery, which was wholly-owned by TotalErg,
was converted into a depot in 2012.

8.1.1.2. North America

The Group’s main sites are located in Texas, in Port Arthur (refinery,
steam cracker), Bayport (polyethylene) and La Porte
(polypropylene), and in Louisiana, in Carville (styrene, polystyrene).

Located on the same site in Port Arthur, TOTAL wholly owns a

169 kb/d capacity refinery as well as a 40% stake in a steam
cracker (BASF Total Petrochemicals, BTP). The Group is working to
strengthen the synergies between these two plants.

The new pipeline connecting the Port Arthur refinery with the Sun
terminal in Nederland was commissioned in 2014, allowing easy
access to all domestic crudes, at an advantage compared with the
international market.

As a result of the investments made to adapt its furnaces and build
a tenth ethane furnace, which was commissioned in March 2014,
the BTP cracker is now able to produce more than 1 Mt/y of ethylene,
including more than 85% from advantaged feedstock (mainly
ethane, propane, butane). BTP thus benefits from favorable market
conditions in the United States. Furthermore, TOTAL has initiated
studies regarding the construction of a new ethane steam cracker
on the Port Arthur site, in synergy with the refinery and BTP steam
cracker. The investment decision is expected to be made in 2016.

3.1.1.3. Asia and the Middle East

TOTAL is continuing to expand in growth areas and is developing
sites in countries with favorable access to raw materials.

(1) End 2014, the Group signed a memorandum of understanding to sell this stake in the Schwedt refinery.

In Saudi Arabia, the joint venture Saudi Aramco Total Refining and
Petrochemical Company (SATORP), created in 2008 by TOTAL
(37.5%) and Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabian Oil Company, 62.5%),
built and operates a 400 kb/d refinery in Jubail. Saudi Aramco
plans to retain a 37.5% interest in SATORP, with the remaining 25%
expected to be listed on the Saudi stock exchange. Most of the
various units of SATORP were gradually commissioned in 2013
and the commercial exports of petroleum products started in
September 2013. The startup phase was successfully completed in
the first half of 2014 and production reached full capacity in mid-2014.

The configuration of this refinery is designed for processing heavy
crudes produced in Saudi Arabia and selling fuels and other light
products that meet strict specifications and that are mainly
intended for export. The refinery is also integrated with
petrochemical units: a 700 kt/y paraxylene unit, a 200 kt/y
propylene unit, and a 140 kt/y benzene unit.

In China, TOTAL holds a 22.4% stake in WEPEC, a company that
operates a refinery located in Dalian and that also produces
polypropylene.

The Group is also active through its 200 kt/y capacity polystyrene
plant in Foshan in the Guangzhou region. A new polystyrene
compounds unit started up on this site in the first quarter of 2013.
In September 2014, TOTAL also successfully began production on
anew 200 kt/y polystyrene plant in Ningbo in the Shanghai region.

Finally, TOTAL is continuing to study a project in Inner Mongolia to
produce polyolefins from coal (refer to point 3.1.1.8.1. below, Coal
to polymers).

In South Korea, TOTAL holds a 50% stake in Samsung Total
Petrochemicals Co. Ltd. (STC), which operates the petrochemical
complex in Daesan (condensate splitter, steam cracker, styrene,
paraxylene, polyolefins). To keep up with growth in Asian markets,

8.1.1.4. Crude oil refining capacity
The table below sets forth TOTAL’s crude oil refining capacity:

As of December 31,

two major construction projects were completed in 2014,
thereby doubling the site’s capacity compared to 2011.
The following two units were thus started up successfully in
February and July 2014, respectively:

— anew EVA unit with about 240 kt/y capacity; and

— anew aromatics unit with a capacity of 1.5 Mt/y of paraxylene
and benzene, the raw material of which is supplied by a new
condensate splitter that also produces kerosene (1.5 Mt/y) and
diesel (1.0 Mt/y).

The site’s paraxylene production capacity increased as a result of
these new units to 1.8 Mt/y.

In November 2014, Samsung, which holds a 50% stake in STC,
announced the divestment of 81% of its interest in the SGC company,
which holds its interest in STC. This divestment is expected to be
completed by mid-2015. The Group does not expect this transaction
to have a material impact on the joint venture’s operations.

In Qatar, the Group holds interests") in two ethane-based steam
crackers (Qapco, Ras Laffan Olefin Cracker (RLOC)) and four
polyethylene lines (Qapco, Qatofin), including the Qatofin linear
low-density polyethylene plant in Messaied with a capacity of

450 kt/y and a new 300 kt/y low-density polyethylene line operated
by Qapco, which started up in 2012.

TOTAL holds a 10% stake in the Ras Laffan condensate refinery,
which has a capacity of 146 kb/d. The construction project to
double the refinery’s capacity started in April 2014 and is expected
to be completed in 2016. The project also includes a new diesel
hydrotreating unit, which was commissioned in May 2014.

In Singapore, the Group sold its 95 kt/y capacity polystyrene
production site in November 2014.

3.1.1.8. Development of new avenues
for the production of fuels and polymers

In addition to optimizing existing processes, TOTAL is exploring
new ways for monetizing carbon resources, conventional or
otherwise (natural gas, coal, biomass, waste). A number of
innovative projects are being examined that entail defining access
to the resource (nature, location, supply method, transport), the
nature of the molecules and target markets (fuels, lubricants,
petrochemicals, specialty chemicals), and the most appropriate,
efficient and environmentally-friendly conversion processes.

3.1.1.8.1. Coal to polymers

TOTAL has developed know-how in the various processes used to
convert coal into higher value products by gasification. These
efforts allow a better understanding of the technological issues
specific to each targeted market (e.g., fuels through Fischer-
Tropsch process, methanol or syngas), particularly in terms of
energy optimization, water consumption and carbon capture.

TOTAL is studying a coal-to-olefin (CTO) conversion project that
would be located in Inner Mongolia in China in partnership with the
China Power Investment Corporation utility company. This project,


--- Page 42 ---

with a capacity of about 800 kt/y of olefins, would use the
innovative methanol-to-olefins/olefins cracking process (MTO/OCP),
which the Group successfully tested in 2013 on a demonstration
unit at Feluy, Belgium. The Chinese authorities gave their initial
approval of the project in November 2013. The project anticipates
submitting its environmental impact assessment to the Ministry of
the Environment mid-2015, followed by the start of its FEED studies.

3.1.1.8.2. Natural gas to liquids

TOTAL continues to develop its know-how in the conversion of
natural gas to fuel. For large-scale projects (more than 10 kboe/d),
TOTAL is consolidating its know-how in the most efficient conversion
processes and is studying innovative potential routes of gas
monetization. TOTAL is also conducting research into small-scale
concepts, such as flared gas solutions.

3.1.1.8.3. Biomass to polymers

TOTAL is involved in the development of processes dedicated or
related to the conversion of biomass to polymers. The main area of
focus is the development of a polylactic acid (PLA) production
technology through Futerro, a joint venture with Galactic, a lactic
acid producer, as well as developing a technology for dehydration
of bio-alcohols into olefins (monomers for the manufacture of large
conventional polymers), in collaboration with IFPen/Axens. Several
projects are under study based on these technologies.

3.1.1.8.4. Biomass to fuels

In Europe, TOTAL produces biofuel, namely hydrogenated
vegetable oils for incorporation into diesel, and ether produced from
ethanol and isobutene for incorporation into gasoline.

TOTAL is a member of the BioTFuel consortium, the objective of
which is to develop a chain for converting lignocellulose into
fungible, sulfur-free liquid products through gasification and
synthesis using the Fischer-Tropsch process. To benefit from
economies of scale, it is envisaged to convert lignocellulosic
feedstock into a blend with fossil fuel resources. This development
involves an initial pilot demonstration phase located on the Dunkirk
site in France for which construction was started in

September 2014.

In 2014, the Group incorporated:

— In gasoline, 473 kt of ethanol" at its European refineries and
several depots”); and

— Indiesel, 1,800 kt of VOME or HVO®at its European refineries
and several depots”).

3.1.2. Specialty Chemicals

The specialty chemicals businesses include elastomer processing
(Hutchinson) and electroplating chemistry (Atotech). They primarily
serve the automotive, construction, electronics, aerospace and
convenience goods markets, for which marketing strategy,
innovation and customer service are key drivers. TOTAL markets
specialty products in more than sixty countries and intends to
develop by combining organic growth and targeted acquisitions.
This development is focused on high-growth markets and the
marketing of innovative products with high added value that meet
the Group’s Sustainable Development approach.

In 2014, consolidated worldwide sales of specialty chemicals
activities (excluding Bostik) totaled €4.4 billion ($5.9 billion), a 6%
increase compared to 2013 and up 7% compared to 2012.

On February 2, 2015, TOTAL finalized the divestment of its
wholly-owned subsidiary Bostik, specialized in adhesive chemicals,
to the Arkema group. This divestment follows the offer received
from Arkema in September 2014. Bostik counts approximately
4,900 employees over forty-eight global production sites with sales
of €1.5 billion ($2 billion) in 2014.

8.1.2.1. Elastomer processing

Hutchinson designs and provides innovative and tailor-made
solutions to support automotive and aircraft manufacturers and
major industries (defense, energy) across the world. Among the
industry's leaders worldwide), the company mainly develops
anti-vibration and fluid management systems as well as sealing
solutions that combine performance and energy efficiency.

Hutchinson has more than ninety production sites and 28,900
employees across the world to cater to its customers.

Hutchinson's sales were €3.5 billion in 2014 ($4.6 billion), up 6%
compared to 2013.

This growth was due to the strong performance of the world’s
automotive markets, especially German and Asian manufacturers.
In July 2013, Hutchinson entered into a joint venture with the
Japanese company, Nichirin, in the automobile brake hose
segment at Palamos in Spain.

In 2014, Hutchinson also performed well on its other markets,
particularly civil aeronautics and helicopters. To consolidate its
position, at the end of 2012, Hutchinson acquired Marquez,

a Canadian company specializing in composite air-conditioning
circuits. Moreover, to enhance its product portfolio for the oil
and gas industry, Hutchinson acquired Gasket International

in July 2013, a company that specializes in the production

of sealing parts for valves.

Since 2014, all Hutchinson entities that previously operated under
twenty-six different brand names have been marketed under a unique
Hutchinson brand name for greater consistency and visibility.

8.1.2.2. Electroplating

Atotech is the leading company in the electroplating sector based
on worldwide sales"). It is active in the markets for electronics
(printed circuits, semiconductors) and general surface treatments
(automotive, construction, furnishing).

Atotech has seventeen production sites worldwide, including seven in
Asia, six in Europe, three in North America and one in South America.

The Company's sales totaled €0.95 billion in 2014 ($1.3 billion),
up by 7% compared to 2013, primarily due to the growth in sales
of electroplating equipment for the electronics market.

In 2014, Atotech successfully pursued its strategy to differentiate
its products through a comprehensive service provided to its

3.2. Trading & Shipping

customers in terms of equipment, processes, design of facilities
and chemical products and through the development of green,
innovative technologies to reduce environmental footprint. This
strategy relies on global coverage provided by its technical centers
located near customers.

Atotech intends to continue to grow in Asia, which already
represents approximately 67% of its global sales.

In order to strengthen its position in the electronics market, Atotech
plans to increase and modernize its production capacity in Asia
with two major projects in Malaysia and China. By relocating
production as close as possible to its markets, these two projects
are also part of its cost-cutting strategy.

Trading & Shipping focuses on serving the Group by:

— selling and marketing the Group's crude oil production;

providing a supply of crude oil for the Group’s refineries;

importing and exporting the appropriate petroleum and refined
products for the Group’s refineries to be able to adjust their
production to the needs of local markets;

chartering appropriate ships for these activities; and

undertaking trading on various derivatives markets.

Trading & Shipping conducts its activities worldwide through
various wholly-owned subsidiaries, including TOTSA Total Oil

Trading S.A., Atlantic Trading & Marketing Inc., Total Trading Asia
Pte, Total Trading and Marketing Canada L.P., Total European
Trading, and Chartering & Shipping Services S.A.

Trading operates extensively on physical and derivatives markets,
both organized and over the counter. In connection with its trading
activities, TOTAL, like most other oil companies, uses derivative
energy instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options) with the
aim of adjusting its exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil
and refined products. These transactions are entered into with
various counterparties.

For additional information concerning derivatives transactions by
Trading & Shipping, see Notes 30 (Financial instruments related to
commodity contracts) and 31 (Market risks) to the Consolidated

In 2014, the activities of Trading were affected by the economic
environment and the world oil market situation as described below.

The increasing surplus supply in the world oil market led to a steady
drop in prices from mid-year, decreasing by more than 40% by the
end of December. The surplus caused crude prices to flip from
backwardation in the first half of the year to contango thereafter.
The surplus resulted from continued strong growth in North
American oil production in 2014, which substantially outstripped
weak growth in global oil demand. North America accelerated the
construction of infrastructure (pipelines and rail networks) to move
rising supply from the center of the continent and the southwest of
Texas to refineries located on the American coast of the Gulf of
Mexico and the east coast of the United States.

In a less favorable world economic context, the growth in world
demand for oil slowed from +1.2 Mb/d® in 2013 to +0.5 Mb/d® in
2014, due notably to slower growth in natural gas liquids (NGL)
demand in the United States and slower growth in demand for
gasoil east of the Suez and in Europe, as well as the slowdown in
the growth in demand for gasoline in the United States and the
Middle East. Demand for fuel oil continued its decline both in
onshore uses and in marine bunkers. The wave of extreme cold
that gripped North America in the first quarter of 2014 stimulated
demand for heating oil but depressed demand for other products
(notably NGL) as the cold-snap slowed economic activity. In
Europe, the mild temperatures recorded in the first quarter of 2014
decreased heating oil consumption. The slowdown in economic
activity and the drop in coal mining and related transportation of
coal led to a decline in the use of diesel in China. In the Middle
East, diesel and gasoline consumption fell as the conflict in
northern lraq interrupted supply to local consumers.

Estimated global oil supply increased to +1.6 Mb/d in 2014

compared to +0.6 Mb/d in 2013. Non-OPEC production grew by
approximately +1.9 Mb/d, with an increase of +1.6 Mb/d in North
America (United States, Canada and Mexico), +0.2 Mb/d in Latin

America, and +0.1 Mb/d in the North Sea. In the other regions,
production either declined or stagnated. Overall OPEC crude oil
production continued to contract (-0.3 Mb/d compared with -1.0 Mb/d
in 2018), as the losses recorded in Libya and Iraq were not offset
by the increases generated in other member countries. During most
of the year, crude oil production capacity of approximately 2.5 Mb/d
was rendered unavailable in several OPEC and non-OPEC
countries by political tensions, conflicts and sanctions imposed on
certain countries. Saudi production, at approximately 9.6 Mb/d,
was stable in 2014 compared to 2013.

As supply growth greatly exceeded demand growth in 2014,
surplus supply vis-a-vis demand increased to reach approximately
+1.0 Mb/d versus +0.1 Mb/d in 2013. This imbalance contributed
to the fall in prices in the second half of the year.

In the first half of the year, prompt prices for Brent ICE (1* line)
fluctuated primarily between $105/b and $110/b, peaking at $115.1/b
in mid-June and averaging around $109/b. Subsequently, Brent
ICE prices fell steadily, reaching $57.3/b on December 31 and this
drop continued in January 2015 before climbing back to $60/b in
February. As prices declined, the ICE Brent price structure flipped
from backwardation to contango, supporting commercial storage of
crude and better refinery margins in the second half of 2014.

The continuing development of rail and pipeline infrastructure

in the United States to move the increasing supply surplus from the
mid-continent to refineries on the coasts contributed to a marked
contraction in the price spread between WTI and Brent in 2014
(from -$10.7/b in 2013 to -$6.5/b in 2014). In 2014, the launch
between January and April of the Marketlink pipeline connecting
Cushing (Oklahoma) to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas and the
commissioning in the third and fourth quarters of other pipelines in
the Permian region in west Texas to the Gulf of Mexico helped
restore balance to the crude market in the center of the United
States. WTI was discounted by only -$3.9/b vs. Brent in the fourth
quarter of 2014.

(1) Backwardation is a term used to describe an energy market in which the value of the spot, or prompt, price is higher than the value of the forward or futures contracts trading concurrently.

The reverse situation is referred to as contango.


--- Page 45 ---

While global refining capacity grew by approximately +1.3 Mb/d in
2014, estimated crude throughputs increased by only about +0.6
Mb/d, held back by the slowdown in demand growth and weaker
refining margins outside of North America in the first half of the year.
Margins increased with the flip in crude oil prices to contango,
leading to a slight growth in throughputs in the second half of 2014
compared to 2013. Most new refining capacity was concentrated in
China (+0.9 Mb/d) and the Middle East (+0.5 Mb/d). Structurally
robust, refining margins in the United States pushed local refineries
to maximize their throughputs to reach exceptionally high operating
rates, which supported a high level of diesel exports. The ICE gasoil
premium to Brent in northwest Europe began the year at a sustained
level due to the wave of extreme cold in North America, but then
deteriorated considerably in mid-year due to the weakness in
demand and substantial international supply. It closed the year
much stronger as demand improved late in the year while refinery
maintenance tightened supply.

3.2.2. Shipping

The transportation of crude oil and refined products necessary for
the activities of the Group is coordinated by Shipping. These
requirements are fulfilled through balanced use of the spot and
time-charter markets. Shipping maintains a rigorous safety policy,
mainly through a strict selection of chartered vessels. Like a certain
number of other oil companies and ship owners, in its Shipping
activity the Group uses freight rate derivative contracts to adjust its
exposure to freight rate fluctuations.

In 2014, Shipping chartered nearly 3,000 voyages to transport
approximately 122 Mt of crude oil and refined products, compared
to 115 Mt in 20138. As of December 31, 2014, Shipping employed a
fleet of forty-eight vessels (including seven LPG carriers), none of
which were single-hulled, that were chartered under long-term or
medium-term agreements. The fleet has an average age of less
than six years.

In 2014, the shipping market witnessed a positive turnaround in oil
transport activities, especially for larger crude and product tankers.
Conditions were less favorable, meanwhile, for medium-sized
petroleum product carriers, although year-end brought a slight
improvement to the economic environment. During the second half
of 2014, marine bunker prices, driven by decreasing crude prices,
substantially dropped, which considerably improved ship owners’
results. However, transport costs benefited little from this situation.

After contracting in 2013, global demand for the transport of crude
oil maintained the same level in 2014. The decrease in North
American imports, driven by the sharp increase in domestic
production, was once again offset by the growing transport needs
in Asia. This continent continued to diversify its supplies from more
distant regions (South America, West Africa). At the same time, the

growth in the fleet slowed to a level that had not been seen for
many years. This context rebalanced supply and demand and
resulted in a return to high volatility and freight rates that were, on
average, higher than in 2013.

The situation in the petroleum product maritime shipping market
continued to be good overall for larger vessels, which benefited
from the lengthening of trips. On the one hand, arbitrages in favor
of routes to Asia, particulary the flows of naphtha from Europe
which continued at the same pace as in 2013, and on the other
hand, exports from new Middle-East and Far-East refineries,
contributed to a strong growth in demand. The freight rates were
somewhat weaker for medium-size product carriers due to the
delivery of many new tankers.

4.1. Marketing & Services

Since January 1, 2012, the Marketing & Services (M&S) business
segment has been a coherent structure dedicated to the development
of TOTAL's oil products distribution activities (and related services)
throughout the world. Present in more than 150 countries“), M&S.
relays TOTAL's brand image to its customers, both private and
professional. TOTAL's highly visible, innovative and assertive lineup
of solutions is presented to its customers through large advertising
campaigns, substantial R&D expenses and an ambitious digital
transformation plan.

M&S follows a proactive, primarily organic, development strategy
involving a geographic repositioning towards high-growth areas.
This repositioning is accelerated by the sale of certain business
activities in Europe (sale in progress of the LPG marketing subsidiary
in France and the LPG/commercial sales activity in Switzerland).

TOTAL is one of the leading distributors of petroleum products in
Western Europe” and the leading distributor® on the African continent.

M&S’ three main areas of activity are:

— anetwork of slightly more than 15,500 service stations.
M&S aims to consolidate its market share in the mature areas of
Western Europe and further develop its position in high-growth
markets. The network's market share in Africa increased from
15% in 2012 to 18% in 2014;

— the production and sales of lubricants, areas in which M&S is
expanding its partnerships internationally to support growth.
The M&S global market share has increased from 4.2% in 2012
to 4.5% in 2014; and

— the distribution of products and services for professional markets:
M&S is a major player in the market for jet fuel, special fluids,
bitumen, heavy fuel oils, marine bunker and LPG.

As part of its activities, M&S holds stakes in five refineries in Africa,
one in Europe through its share in TotalErg (49%) and one in the
Caribbean through its 50% stake in SARA (Société anonyme

4.1.3. Europe

In Europe, the Group continues to optimize its Marketing activities
while growing in growth markets and segments.

In Western Europe, TOTAL has a network of more than 8,500 service
stations® spread over France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Germany and Italy. TOTAL is regaining market share in these areas
(+1%) over the 2012-2014 period) by developing an innovative
and diversified line of products and services.


--- Page 48 ---

In France, the dense retail network includes 1,570 TOTAL-branded
service stations, more than 650 Total Access stations (service station
concept combining low prices and premium TOTAL-branded fuels
and services) and approximately 1,500 Elan service stations, which
are located mainly in rural areas. Since its launch in 2011, Total
Access has led to the Group regaining more than 2%") market share.

In addition, TOTAL offers an expanded fuel and service offering to
131,000 vehicle fleets (/.e., 1.9 million GR card holders).

TOTAL holds stakes in twenty-eight depots in France, five of which
are operated by Group companies.

In Germany, TOTAL is the country’s fourth largest operator and
continues to expand its network. With more than 1,160 service
stations at year-end 2014, the Group has gained 1% in market
share in two years.

In Italy, TOTAL holds a 49% stake in TotalErg, which is the country’s
fourth largest operator with close to 2,800 service stations. As part of
an asset optimization strategy, TotalErg ceased production at its
Rome refinery in late 2012 and subsequently converted that site
into a logistics hub for petroleum products storage.

To distribute its specialty products, the Group benefits from an
extensive network in Europe and relies on numerous industrial facilities
to produce lubricants (mainly Rouen in France and Ertvelde in
Belgium), special fluids (Oudalle in France) and bitumen
(Brunsbuttel in Germany).

In Northern, Central and Eastern Europe, TOTAL accelerated the
growth of its positions in 2014 in the growing markets of Eastern
Europe, especially for lubricants and specialty bitumen products.

In Europe, the Group is a major player in the market for fuel-payment
cards, with nearly 3.3 million cards issued.

With the AS24 card, TOTAL has a dedicated offering for the heavy-
duty vehicles segment in twenty-nine European countries.
Bolstered by a network of more than 740 service stations, AS24 is
expected to continue to grow primarily through expansion in the
Mediterranean basin and Eastern Europe and through its toll
payment card service, which covers nearly twenty countries.

4.1.4. Africa & the Middle East

TOTAL is the leading marketer of petroleum products on the African
continent and select Middle Eastern countries, with a market share
averaging 16% in 2014. The Group's networks in these high-growth
markets grew from 4,500 service stations in 2013 to 4,800 in 2014,
spread over close to fifty countries. The Group operates major
networks in South Africa, Turkey, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and
Morocco.

In Egypt, TOTAL acquired the Shell and Chevron service station
networks and wholesale business in 2013, allowing the Group to
become in 2014 the second largest private operator in Africa’s
largest market, with a 14% network market share").

In Jordan, TOTAL continued developing its service station network
and wholesale business following its acquisition of a distribution
license in 2012, enabling the Group to reach a market share of
33.8%") in 2014 (159 service stations).

In the Céte d’lvoire, Senegal and Burkina Faso, M&S acquired in
2014 the networks of independent oil and gas companies to increase
its market share in these countries.

Finally, to strengthen its local presence, M&S began a process
of opening up the share capital of select subsidiaries to regional
investors, particularly in Morocco and Senegal.

TOTAL is pursuing a strategy for growth in specialty products markets
in Africa and the Middle East. M&S, which relies in particular on a
lubricants blending plant in Dubai, started up new plants of this
type in Egypt in 2012 and in Saudi Arabia in 2013.

Moreover, TOTAL has become a leading partner for mining customers
in Africa by delivering supply chain and management solutions for
fuels and lubricants.

Finally, TOTAL continued to develop its Awango by Total solar solutions,
expanding this line to four new countries on the African continent
in 2014 (for additional information, refer to point 3.4. of Chapter 7).

4.1.5. Asia-Pacific

At year-end 2014, TOTAL was present in more than twenty countries
in the Asia-Pacific region and continues to strengthen its position

in the distribution of fuels and specialty products. TOTAL operates
service station networks in China, Pakistan, the Philippines,
Cambodia and Indonesia, and is a significant player in the Pacific
islands. The Group’s network continued to grow, reaching slightly
more than 1,000 service stations at year-end 2014. Ground
transportation lubricant sales in the area increased by 2.5% in 2014
compared with 2013.

In China, the Group was operating approximately 200 service
stations at year-end 2014 through two joint ventures with Sinochem
and a wholly-owned subsidiary. In October 2013, the Group
opened its third lubricants blending plant in China. Located in
Tianjin, this state-of-the-art plant has a capacity of 200 kt/y.

In Pakistan, TOTAL, with its local partner PARCO, is in the process
of acquiring Chevron’s distribution network. This acquisition should
expand TOTAL's network by more than 500 service stations and

strengthen the Group's distribution and logistics capacities in Pakistan.

In Singapore, one of the Group's largest lubricants blending plants,
featuring a capacity of 310 kt/y, is currently under construction.
Operations are scheduled to start in mid-2015.

In India, TOTAL continued to strengthen its positions in the lubricants
and LPG sectors with the expansion of its LPG network to 48
stations. In 2012, TOTAL inaugurated its first lubricants, bitumen,
special fluids and additives technical center outside of Europe.

In Vietnam, TOTAL continued to strengthen its presence in the
specialty products market. The Group became one of the leaders in
the Vietnamese LPG market with the acquisition of Vinagas in 2012.

4.1.6. Americas

In the Americas, TOTAL is active directly in more than twenty
countries and indirectly (via distributors) in approximately twenty
additional countries. TOTAL operates a large number of industrial
units in these countries including, in particular, the production of
lubricants and the storage and bottling of LPG. In addition, since 2012,
the Group has opened new distribution subsidiaries in Colombia, Peru
and the Dominican Republic, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

In the Caribbean, the Group operates on several islands and has
a significant position in the fuel distribution business with more than
400 service stations.

In Latin America, TOTAL continues to pursue its specialty products
(primarily lubricants and special fluids) growth strategy.

In the United States and Canada, TOTAL mainly markets specialty
products, particularly lubricants, jet fuels and special fluids.

To strengthen its special fluids business, the Group took on a project
to build a special fluids production plant near Houston, Texas,
which is expected to be operational in 2015.

4.1.7. Product and services developments

In 2014, TOTAL continued its technical partnerships in racing,

in particular with Renault (Renault Sport F1) and PSA Citroén (WRC
and WTCC). These partnerships demonstrate TOTAL's technical
excellence in the formulation of fuels and lubricants under extreme
conditions and requirements to reduce fuel consumption. At end-2014,
TOTAL and Renault renewed their global partnership for the next
five years, in the areas of R&D, business relations with Renault
after-sales networks and Formula 1.

4.2. New Energies

In order to respond to developments in world markets and prepare
tomorrow's growth opportunities, TOTAL develops energy solutions
in collaboration with its consumer and professional customers that
optimize their energy bills such as the Total Ecosolutions product
and service label (refer to point 2.2.4. of chapter 7). These solutions
integrate a diversified range of energy sources (fuels, gas, photovoltaics
and wood pellets, the sales capacities of which increased in Europe
in 2014) as well as consumption auditing, monitoring and management
services. In 2012, TOTAL launched the Tenag joint venture in
Germany, in which the Group holds 49%, and in 2014 acquired
BHC Energy in France, both devoted to energy efficiency.

TOTAL also supports the development of alternative fuels other
than conventional fossil energies:

— Hydrogen: Through its “Clean Energy Partnership” (CEP) in
Germany, TOTAL participates in the development of a network
of hydrogen stations with the goal of developing fifty hydrogen
stations by year-end 2015. In addition, TOTAL and its partners
in the “H2 Mobility Germany” initiative signed an agreement to
create a joint venture with the aim of constructing a network of
approximately 400 hydrogen stations by 2023, subject to
deployment of more than 250,000 fuel-cell electric vehicles.

— Electro-mobility: TOTAL has approximately twenty prototype
electric vehicle refueling stations in the Netherlands, Belgium
and Germany. The development and demonstration of the
distribution of electricity (fast charge) intended for electric
vehicles continued in 2014 in TOTAL’s European subsidiaries
through industrial partnerships with Renault, Nissan, BMW,
Volkswagen, EDF and Tesla.

— LNG: TOTAL's European subsidiaries continued to monitor the
potential of LNG as a fuel for heavy duty vehicles in 2014.

New Energies is committed to developing renewable energies that
will, in combination with hydrocarbons, help respond to the
challenge of climate change by developing a diversified energy mix
while also generating lower CO, emissions. To this end, TOTAL is
focusing on two main themes of development: solar energy, which
benefits from unlimited energy resources, particularly in certain
geographical areas where the Group has a significant presence,
and the conversion of biomass through biotechnology, which aims
to develop new biosourced product solutions for transport and
chemicals. In addition, the Group actively monitors other renewable
energies it does not currently prioritize for development.

4.2.1. Solar energy

TOTAL is developing upstream operations through industrial production
and downstream marketing activities in the photovoltaic sector based
on crystalline silicon technology. The Group is furthermore pursuing
R&D investments in this field through several industrial and
academic partnerships.

Photovoltaic solar energy has come of age and its growth is
accelerating. The steady reduction in photovoltaic electricity costs
is increasing solar competitiveness in an ever-growing number of
markets, in solar farms and residential and commercial applications.

(1) Daimler, Shell, OMY, Air Liquide and Linde.
(2) Fraunhofer study.

4.2.1.1. SunPower

As of December 31, 2014, TOTAL held 59.77% of SunPower, an
American company listed on NASDAQ and based in San Jose,
California. SunPower is an integrated player that designs,
manufactures and supplies cells as well as the highest-efficiency
crystalline silicon-based solar panels in the market. SunPower is
also active in the design and construction of large turnkey power
plants and in the marketing of integrated solar solutions for
decentralized electricity generation.

Upstream, SunPower manufactures all of its cells in Asia (Philippines,
Malaysia) and has a total production capacity of 1,300 MW/y.

The company is constantly optimizing its production process to
reduce costs while maintaining its technological leadership through
its significant R&D program. The cells are assembled into modules,
or solar panels, in plants located in Asia, the United States, Mexico,
Europe and South Africa. A 350 MW/y expansion in capacity was
approved at the end of 2013 for a production start-up in 2015.

Downstream, SunPower markets its panels worldwide for applications
ranging from residential and commercial roof tiles to large solar
power plants.


--- Page 50 ---

In 2014, SunPower pursued the construction, in the United States,
of the world’s largest solar farm, Solar Star (709 MWp), and continued
its international development, building solar power plants in Chile
(70 MWp), in which TOTAL has a 20% stake, and South Africa (83 MWp).
In South Africa, the construction of another 86 MWp solar farm will
start in early 2015.

SunPower is pursuing its development in residential and commercial
markets, in particular in the United States, by increasing its service
offerings for solar power production, management and financing.
SunPower is also developing its Smart Energy activity to allow its
residential customers to optimize their power consumption. In 2014,
SunPower signed several agreements with companies developing
solutions in this domain. The acquisition in 2014 of SolarBridge
Technologies, Inc., a micro-inverter producer, will allow the conversion
of direct current into alternating current at the panel level and
monitoring of each panel's production, thus optimizing power production.

4.2.1.2. Other solar assets

In Abu Dhabi, the Shams 1 solar power plant (109 MW of parabolic
concentrated solar power) was commissioned in September 2013

with production being sold to the Abu Dhabi Water Electricity Company
(ADWEC). TOTAL (20%) is involved in its operation for a 25-year period.

TOTAL owns a 50% interest in the French company Sunzil, which
markets photovoltaic panels in French overseas territories.

The Group is developing projects to install decentralized solar
solutions in rural electrification initiatives in a number of countries,
including in South Africa via Kwazulu Energy Services Company
(KES), in which TOTAL holds a 35% stake (for more information,
refer to point 3.4. of chapter 7).

4.2.1.3. New solar technologies

In order to strengthen its technological leadership in the crystalline
silicon value chain, and in addition to its cooperation with SunPower
in the R&D field, New Energies partners with leading laboratories
and research institutes in France and abroad. The aim of these
partnerships is to develop and optimize the photovoltaic solar power
chain (silicon, wafers, cells, modules and systems) by cutting
production costs and multiplying its applications, while increasing
the efficiency and reliability of the components, as well as developing
downstream systems, products and services beyond solar power
production. New Energies is also strengthening its expertise in solar
resource evaluation and prediction.

In this regard, TOTAL is working with the Interuniversity MicroElectronics
Center (IMEC) in Belgium and the Ecole Polytechnique’s Laboratory
of physics of interfaces and thin layers (LPICM) in France, which
specializes in low-temperature plasma deposition processes.
Further to this partnership, TOTAL participates in the Institut
Photovoltaique d’ile-de-France (IPVF) project, which aims to
eventually become one of the reference centers worldwide
conducting research into latest-generation photovoltaic devices.

With respect to electricity storage, TOTAL is continuing its R&D
program with renowned institutions such as the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States notably to develop
new battery technologies, and is also investing in start-ups such as
Ambri (12.3%), founded by MIT.

4.2.2. Biotechnologies
and the conversion of biomass

TOTAL is exploring a number of opportunities for developing
biomass depending on its nature, accessibility and sustainability.
The Group's objective is to sell high-performance molecules in
targeted markets (fuel, lubricants, special polymers, chemicals, etc.).
The focus of New Energies is on the biochemical conversion
process for this biomass.

In 2010, Amyris Inc., an American company listed on NASDAQ, was
TOTAL's first significant equity investment in biotechnology. At year-end
2014, TOTAL held 17.2% of the company. A collaboration agreement
with Amyris was signed covering research, development, production
and marketing of biosourced molecules. Amyris owns a cutting-edge
industrial synthetic biology platform designed to improve and optimize
microorganisms that can convert sugars into molecules of interest
through fermentation. Amyris also owns a research laboratory and
pilot units in California and Brazil. Amyris has successfully started
and operates a plant in Brazil that converts 30 million liters of
sugarcane juice into molecules of interest for perfumes and cosmetics
as well as farnesene, a molecule of interest for a number of
chemical or downstream oil markets, including specialty products
and fuels (diesel or jet). In June 2014, the bio-sourced jet fuel
produced by Amyris received the certification required to be sold to
airlines (for blends of up to 10% in jet fuel derived from hydrocarbons),
allowing its use in commercial flights in the second half of 2014,

in partnership with Air France and KLM, as well as GOL between
the United States and Brazil, thereby providing the technical
demonstration of this new jet fuel source. Large-scale deployment
will take several years, as a cost reduction program is necessary

to make the molecule competitive with fossil jet fuel.

In addition, the Group continues to develop a global network of
R&D partnerships in technology segments that are complementary
to Amyris’ platform (deconstruction of lignocellulose, synthetic
biology, metabolism engineering), including with Joint BioEnergy
Institute (JBEI, United States), Novogy (now wholly-owned, United
States), the University of Wageningen (the Netherlands) and the
Toulouse White Biotechnology consortium (TWB, France).

The Group is also studying the longer-term potential for developing
a cost-effective phototrophic process for producing biomolecules
through microalgae bioengineering and associated processes.

4.2.3. Other renewable energies

In the field of wind power, TOTAL owns a 12 MW wind farm in
Mardyck near Dunkirk, France, which was commissioned in 2003.

In marine energy, TOTAL holds a 24.1% share in Scotrenewables
Tidal Power, located in the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Following
successful tests on a 250 kW prototype completed in 2013, a2 MW
commercial model is currently under construction.

5. Investments

5.1. Major investments over the 2012-2014 period”

(M$) 2014 2013 2012
Upstream 26,520 29,750 25,200
Refining & Chemicals 2,022 2,708 2,502
Marketing & Services 1,818 1,814 1,671
Corporate 149 159 102
Total 30,509 34,431 29,475

Organic investments, including net investments in equity affiliates
and non-consolidated subsidiaries, amounted to $26.4 billion in 2014
compared with $28.3 billion in 2013, a 7% decrease. The Group’s
organic investments reached a high in 2013, as provided in the
Group’s roadmap, and the commitment made to reduce investments.
was fulfilled. Most of the major projects that will support the Group’s
production growth through 2017 were launched, with investments
reducing as projects start up.

In 2014, most investments in the Upstream segment were geared
toward the development of new hydrocarbon production facilities
and exploration operations. Development expenditure mainly pertained
to major projects that drive the Group's growth, such as GLNG and
Ichthys in Australia, Surmont in Canada, the Ekofisk and Eldfisk
areas in Norway, the Laggan-Tormore project in the United Kingdom,
Moho North in the Republic of the Congo, CLOV in Angola, Ofon II
and Egina in Nigeria and Yamal in Russia.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, investments were made in
facilities maintenance and safety, as well as in projects aimed at
improving the plants’ competitiveness, particularly their energy
efficiency. 2014 was marked by the startup of the new SATORP
refinery in Saudi Arabia and the new petrochemicals plants in Daesan,
South Korea. In addition, the investment project in Antwerp, Belgium
and the adaptation project in Carling, France are currently underway.
In the Marketing & Services segment, investments in 2014 mainly
concerned the network, logistics and specialty products production
and storage facilities.

While mobilizing its teams for the startups in the Upstream segment
over the next two years, the Group is preparing for the future
beyond 2017 by expanding its acreage and acquiring stakes in new
promising assets. Acquisitions were $2.5 billion, comprised
principally of the acquisition of an interest in the Elk and Antelope
discoveries in Papua New Guinea, the acquisition of an additional
stake in OAO Novatek?! and the carry on the Utica gas and
condensate field in the United States.

Gross investments (including acquisitions and changes in non-current
loans) therefore fell by 12% to $29.0 billion in 2014 compared with
$32.8 billion in 2013.

The Group also continued its asset sale program with the
finalization of sales totaling $4.65 billion in 2014, comprised
essentially of the sale of interests in Shah Deniz and the associated
pipelines in Azerbaijan, Block 15/06 in Angola, GTT (Gaztransport
et Technigaz) and the Cardinal midstream assets in the United
States. Asset sales were $4.75 billion in 2013.

The 2012-14 asset sale target of $15 to $20 billion was met with
the completion of $17.5 billion in sales during the period. In
addition, the sale of Bostik was completed in February 2015 and
the pending sales of the coal mines in South Africa and Totalgaz are
awaiting approval from the authorities.

Net investments were therefore $24.1 billion in 2014, compared to
$25.9 billion in 2013, a decrease of 7%. This decrease was mainly
due to the reduction in investments", since asset sales varied by
only 2% between 2013 and 2014.

(1) Including acquisitions. The main acquisitions in fiscal years 2012-2014 are detailed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Registration Document.


--- Page 52 ---

5.2. Major planned investments

Taking into account the current economic environment, the organic
investment budget has decreased by more than 10% from $26.4 billion
in 2014 to $23-24 billion in 2015. In particular, the Group has reduced
investments in brownfield developments that have become less.
profitable due to the decline in Brent. The decrease in investments is
part of the Group’s strong and immediate response to reduce its
cash break-even point by 40 $/b without compromising the priority
to safety.

Investments in the Upstream segment are expected to amount to
$20 billion and will mainly be allocated to major development
projects, including Ichthys in Australia, Surmont and Fort Hills in
Canada, Moho North in the Republic of the Congo, Kaombo in
Angola, Egina in Nigeria and Yamal in Russia. A significant portion
of the segment’s budget will also be allocated to maintenance and
integrity work on assets already in production.

The Refining & Chemicals segment has an investment budget of
approximately $1.5 billion, which is expected to be allocated to the
refining, petrochemicals and specialty chemicals businesses. The
modernization of the integrated platform in Antwerp, Belgium is the
largest investment in the segment in 2015. A significant portion of
the segment's budget will also be allocated to the maintenance and
safety investments required for these types of industrial activities.

The Marketing & Services segment has an investment budget of
approximately $1.5 billion, which is expected to finance, in particular,
the service station network, logistics, specialty products production
and storage facilities (lubricants, LPG, etc.) and the development of
its activities in New Energies. Most of the Marketing & Services
budget will be allocated to growth areas (Africa, Middle East, Asia
and Latin America).

After 2015, TOTAL expects investments to be in line with more
moderate post-2017 growth from a larger production base.
The Group monitors the evolution of the Brent price and will
consequently adapt its investments without compromising its
medium-term objectives.

TOTAL self-finances most of its investments from its excess cash
from operations (refer to the consolidated statement of cash flows,
point 5. of Chapter 10), which is mainly supplemented by accessing
the bond market on a regular basis, when conditions on the financial
markets are favorable (refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, point 7. of Chapter 10). However, investments for
certain joint ventures between TOTAL and external partners are
funded through specific project financing.

Active management of the asset portfolio, which is fully integrated
into the Group's strategy, creates value and TOTAL has confirmed
its 2015-17 asset sale program of $10 billion. In addition, the Group
makes targeted acquisitions. As the first international company to
enter the new ADCO concession in Abu Dhabi, TOTAL demonstrated
its ability to access resources under good conditions and create
strong partnerships in a strategic region offering various development
opportunities.

As part of certain project financing arrangements, TOTAL S.A. has
provided guarantees. These guarantees (“Guarantees given on
borrowings”) as well as other information on the Group's off-balance
sheet commitments and contractual obligations appear in Note 23
to the Consolidated Financial Statements (point 7. of Chapter 10).
The Group currently believes that neither these guarantees nor the
other off-balance sheet commitments of TOTAL S.A. or of any other
Group company have, or could reasonably have in the future, a
material effect on the Group’s financial position, income and
expenses, liquidity, investments or financial resources.

The sale of TOTAL's stake in offshore Block OML 138 in Nigeria,
including the Usan field, announced in November 2012 was not
able to close. The Group is actively pursuing efforts to sell this asset.

1. Summary of results and financial position

1.1. Overview of the 2014 fiscal year for TOTAL

The year 2014 was marked by the sharp decline in oil prices in the
second half, which continued in early 2015. Brent oil prices ended
the year 2014 below 60 $/b after a long period of stability at around
110 $/b, due to a substantial increase in oil supply while growth in
demand was lower than expected. At the same time, the euro was
driven down against the dollar by the September 2014 FED decision
in the US and the anticipation of the decisions of the European
Central Bank that were eventually taken in January 2015.

Global oil demand increased by +0.6 Mb/d") compared with +1.1 Mb/d
in 2013, which was lower than anticipated primarily due to a
slowdown in Chinese growth. Global oil supply rose significantly in
2014 by +1.9 Mb/d after a moderate increase of +0.4 Mb/d in
2013. Growth in production was mainly due to a dramatic increase
of unconventional production in North America. Brent oil prices thus
averaged 99.0 $/b in 2014 compared with 108.7 $/b in 2013.

In Asia, where the gas price is indexed to oil, prices dropped
steeply in the second half of the year and the annual price averaged
14 $/Mbtu, compared with 16 $/Mbtu in 2013. Gas prices in
Europe were affected by a very mild winter in 2013-2014 and fell by
more than 20% to 8 $/Mbtu. Finally, American gas, highly abundant
due to shale gas development, was cheaper at 4 $/Mbtu on
average over the year. In the downstream, the year was marked by
volatile refining margins. The margins were very low in the first half
of the year and almost tripled in the second half, benefiting from the
fall in Brent oil prices. On an annual average, the margins remained
low due to overcapacity, particularly in Europe, and the European
Refining Margin Indicator (ERMI) 2 was 18.7 $/t in 2014, compared
with 17.9 $/t in 2013. Petrochemicals margins were very good

in 2014, particularly in the United States, supported by falling raw
material prices, while the polymer market remained favorable.

The environment for Marketing & Services was less favorable than
in 2018, particularly in the European networks.

In this context, TOTAL generated adjusted net results of $12.8 billion
in 2014, down 10% from 2013. This decline essentially reflects the
fall in Brent prices, which was partly offset by the increase in the
income of the Refining & Chemicals segment, which benefited from
its restructuring and took advantage of the volatile margins. Given
the economic environment at the end of the year, the Group
recognized after-tax impairments of about $6.5 billion in the fourth
quarter 2014, essentially related to Canadian oil sands,
unconventional gas, notably in the United States, and refining in
Europe.

Adjusted net operating income from the Upstream segment in 2014
was $10,504 milion compared to $12,450 million in 2013, a decrease

of 16%, which was due essentially to the decrease in the average
realized price of hydrocarbons.

Adjusted net operating income from the Refining & Chemicals
segment in 2014 was $2,489 million, an increase of 34%
compared to 2018, while the refining margin increased by only 4%.
The synergies and efficiency plans supported the ability of the
segment to adapt to the lower European margins in the first half

of 2014 and subsequently take advantage of a more favorable
refining & chemicals environment in the second half of the year.
The petrochemicals environment was more favorable in 2014,
especially in the United States.

Adjusted net operating income from the Marketing & Services segment
in 2014 was $1,254 million, a decrease of 19% compared to 2013.
This decline was mainly due to weather conditions in the first half in
Europe, and lower margins in 2014, notably in the European network.

Acauisitions in 2014 were $2.5 billion, comprised principally of

the acquisition of an interest in the Elk and Antelope discoveries in
Papua New Guinea, the acquisition of an additional stake in
OAONovatek ® and the carry on the Utica gas and condensate field
in the United States. Asset sales were $4.7 billion, comprised
essentially of the sale of interests in Shah Deniz and the associated
pipelines in Azerbaijan, Block 15/06 in Angola, the Cardinal
midstream assets in the United States and GTT

(Gaztransport & Technigaz).

Investments excluding acquisitions amounted to $26 billion in 2014,
down $2 billion from 2013. TOTAL financed its investments and
dividends while maintaining a solid balance sheet and ended 2014
with a net-debt-to-equity ratio of 31.3%, compared to 23.3% in
2013. The increase is partly due to the higher level of net debt
linked to lower cash flow from operations as well as the incomplete
status on December 31, 2014, of the sales of Bostik, Totalgaz

and the South African coal mines, and partly due to the decrease

in equity linked mainly to variations in foreign exchange and to

the impact of impairments.

The Group further improved its safety performance, with a 16%
drop in TRIR® compared with 2013. For all of its projects conducted
in a large number of countries, the Group also places emphasis on
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) challenges and the
development of local economies.

In the Upstream segment, the year 2014 saw the start-up of CLOV
in Angola, which reached its plateau production ahead of schedule
and is a testament to the Group’s deep offshore expertise. TOTAL
also launched the Kaombo project in Angola after optimizing the
project design and reducing the investment by $4 billion. The Group
also continued its exploration program and made discoveries in the
Kurdistan region in Iraq and in Céte d’lvoire, where potential is
under review.

The Refining & Chemicals segment’s net income continued to grow
and the segment is one year ahead in the implementation of its
synergy and efficiency programs. Industrial performance improved
and helped take full advantage, in the second half of the year, of the
more favorable environment for European refining and attractive
petrochemicals margins.

1.2. 2014 Group results

Between 2012 and 2014, the Marketing & Services segment
increased its market shares in the networks where it operates from
12% to 13% in Europe and from 15% to 18% in Africa. TOTAL’s
market share in the lucrative lubricants segment also rose to 4.5%
in 2014 compared with 4.2% in 2012. In New Energies, the Group
is expanding in the field of solar energy through its subsidiary
SunPower, which has won tenders in recent years in Chile and
South Africa. SunPower's net income also benefited from significant
cost cutting measures and the improved efficiency of solar panels.

In 2014, TOTAL dedicated $1,353 million to Research and
Development (R&D), compared with $1,260 million in 2013. The Group
continues to invest strongly to improve its technological expertise in
the exploration and development of oil and gas resources, as well as
to develop its competencies in the fields of solar energy, biomass and
carbon capture and contribute to the evolution of global energy supply.

1.2.1. Sales

Consolidated sales in 2014 were $236,122 million compared with
$251,725 million in 2013, a decrease of 6%.

1.2.2. Operating income from business
segments

The average Brent price decreased by 9% to 99 $/b in 2014. The
European Refining Margin Indicator (ERMI) was 18.7 $/t compared
to 17.9 $/t in 2013, an increase of 4%. The environment for
petrochemicals also improved, notably in the United States.

The euro-dollar exchange rate was 1.33 $/€, unchanged
compared to 2013.

In this context, the adjusted operating income from the business
segments was $21,604 million, a decrease of 22% from 2013. The
effective tax rate") for the business segments was 51.2%
compared to 55.5% in 2013.

Adjusted net operating income from the business segments was
$14,247 million compared to $15,861 million in 2013, a decrease of
10%. This decrease was due essentially to the impact of lower
Brent prices on Upstream results, partially offset by a higher
contribution from downstream activities.

1.2.3. Net income (Group share)

The adjusted net income was $12,837 million compared with
$14,292 million in 2013, a decrease of 10%, essentially due to the
fall in Brent prices. Adjusted net income excludes the after-tax
inventory effect, special items and the effect of changes in fair value:

— The after-tax inventory effect had a negative impact of
$2,453 million in 2014 and a negative impact of $728 million in 2013.

— The effect of changes in fair value had a positive impact of
$25 million in 2014 compared to a negative impact of $58 million
in 2013.

— Other special items in the net income had a negative impact of
$6,165 million in 2014, mainly including $7.1 billion of
impairments. Taking into account the current economic
environment, the Group impaired its oil sands assets in Canada
by approximately $2.2 billion, its unconventional gas notably in
the United States by $2.1 billion, its refining in Europe by $1.4 billion,
as well as certain other assets in the Upstream. These impairments.
were partially offset by the gain on the sale of the Group's interests
in Shah Deniz in Azerbaijan and GTT (Gaztransport et Technigaz).
Special items had a negative impact of $2,278 million in 2013.

In this context, the net income (Group share) was $4,244 million
compared to $11,228 million in 2013, a decrease of 62%.

The effective tax rate for the Group was 53.0%, compared to
56.8% in 2013. This variation is due principally to the benefit of tax
allowances in the UK in the second quarter 2014 which lowered
the average rate in the Upstream and the higher contribution from
downstream, which benefits from a lower tax rate.

On December 31, 2014, there were 2,285 million fully-diluted
shares compared to 2,276 million shares on December 31, 2013.

The adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share, based on
2,281 million fully-diluted weighted-average shares, was $5.63
compared with $6.29 in 2013.

Expressed in euros, adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share was
€4.24, a decrease of 11%.

1.2.4. Investments — divestments

Investments, excluding acquisitions and including changes in
non-current loans, were $26.4 billion in 2014, a decrease of 7%
compared to 2013.

Acauisitions were $2,539 million in 2014, comprised principally of
the acquisition of an interest in the Elk and Antelope discoveries in
Papua New Guinea, the acquisition of an additional stake in

OAO Novatek"’ and the carry on the Utica gas and condensate
field in the United States.

In 2014, asset sales were $4,650 million, comprised essentially of
the sale of interests in Shah Deniz and the associated pipelines in

Net investments ® were $24.1 billion compared with $25.9 billion in
2013, a decrease of 7%.

1.2.5. Profitability

The ROACE in 2014 was 11.1% for the Group, a decrease of 1.9%
compared to 2013. Return on Equity (ROE) was 13.5% in 2014,
compared to 14.9% in 2013.

In 2014, hydrocarbon production was 2,146 kboe/d, a decrease of
7% from 2013, due to the following:

* -6% essentially for the expiration of the ADCO license in the
United Arab Emirates,

¢ -2% for natural decline and higher maintenance in 2014, notably
in the first half, partially offset by production growth in the Utica in
the United States, and

© 41% for production growth from start-ups, essentially CLOV in Angola.

In 2014, excluding ADCO, hydrocarbon production was virtually
stable compared to 2013.

of 16%, which was due essentially to the decrease in the average
realized price of hydrocarbons. The effective tax rate for the
Upstream segment was 57.1% in 2014, compared to 60.0% in
2013. The lower rate reflects mainly the benefit of tax allowances in
the United Kingdom in the second quarter 2014.

the Board of Directors, the remaining 2014 dividend is 0.61 €/share,
equal to the three 2014 interim dividends. The Board of Directors
also decided to propose to the shareholders the option of receiving

Cash flow from operations was $25,608 million in 2014, a 10%
drop compared to 2013, mainly due to the fall in Brent oil prices.

Adjusted cash flow ® was $24,597 million in 2014, a decrease of
9% compared to 2013.

The Group’s net cash flow was $1,468 million in 2014 compared to
$2,634 million in 2013. This decrease was essentially due to lower
cash flow from operations between the two periods, partially
compensated by lower net investments.

The net-debt-to-equity ratio was 31.3% on December 31, 2014
compared to 23.3% on December 31, 2013. The increase is partly
due to the higher level of net debt linked to lower cash flow from
operations as well as the incomplete status on December 31, 2014,
of the sales of Bostik, Totalgaz and the South African coal mines,
and partly due to the decrease in equity linked mainly to variations
in foreign exchange and to the impact of impairments.

(1) Net cash flow = cash flow from operations — net investments (including other transactions with non-controliing interests).

2.3. Borrowing requirements and funding structure

The Group’s policy consists of incurring non-current debt primarily
at a floating rate or, if the opportunity arises at the time of an
issuance, at a fixed rate. Debt is incurred in dollars or euros
according to general corporate needs. Long-term interest rate and
currency swaps may be used to hedge bonds at their issuance in
order to create a variable or fixed rate synthetic debt. In order to
partially modify the interest rate structure of the long-term debt,
TOTAL may also enter into long-term interest rate swaps.

The non-current debt is generally raised by the corporate treasury
entities either directly in dollars or euros or in other currencies which
are then exchanged for dollars or euros through swap issues to
appropriately match general corporate needs.

2.4. External financing available

The Group has established standards for market transactions under
which bank counterparties must be approved in advance, based on
an assessment of the counterparty’s financial soundness (multi-criteria
analysis including a review of the market capitalization and of the
Credit Default Swap (CDS), its ratings with Standard & Poor's and
Moody's, which must be of high quality, and its overall financial
condition).

An overall authorized credit limit is set for each bank and is allotted
among the subsidiaries and the Group's central treasury entities
according to their needs.

To reduce the market values risk on its commitments, in particular
for swaps set as part of bonds issuance, the Group also entered
into margin call contracts with its significant counterparties.

As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate amount of the major
confirmed credit facilities granted by international banks to the
Group's companies (including TOTAL S.A.) was $11,064 million
(compared to $11,581 million on December 31, 2013), of which
$10,764 million were unused ($11,421 million unused as of
December 31, 2013).

TOTAL S.A. has confirmed lines of credit granted by international
banks, which are calculated to allow it to manage its short-term
liquidity needs as required. As of December 31, 2014, these credit
facilities amounted to $10,514 million (compared to $11,031 million
on December 31, 2013), of which $10,514 million were unused
($11,031 million unused as of December 31, 2018).

2.5. Anticipated sources of financing

The agreements for the lines of credit granted to TOTAL S.A. do not
contain conditions related to the Company’s financial ratios, to its
financial ratings from specialized agencies, or to the occurrence of
events that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position.

Credit facilities granted to Group companies other than TOTAL S.A.
are not intended to finance the Group’s general needs; they are
intended to finance either the general needs of the borrowing
subsidiary or a specific project.

As of December 31, 2014, no restrictions applied to the use of the
Group companies’ capital (including TOTAL S.A.) that could
significantly impact the Group's activities, directly or indirectly.

Investments, working capital and dividend payments are financed
essentially by the cash flow generated from operating activities,
asset disposals and, if necessary, by net borrowings.

For the coming years and based on the current financing
conditions, the Company intends to maintain this method of
financing the Group’s investments and activities.

3. Research & Development

In 2014, TOTAL dedicated $1,353 million to Research and
Development (R&D), compared with $1,260 million in 2013 and
$1,034 million in 2012. The process initiated in 2004 to increase
R&D budgets continued.

In 2014, 4,840 people were dedicated to R&D activities, compared
with 4,684 in 2013 and 4,110 in 2012.

R&D at TOTAL focuses on six major axes:

— developing knowledge, tools and technological mastery to
discover and profitably operate complex oil and gas resources to
help meet the global demand for energy;

— developing and industrializing solar, biomass and carbon capture
and storage technologies to help prepare for future energy needs;

— developing practical, innovative and competitive materials and
products that meet customers’ specific needs, contribute to the
emergence of new features and systems, enable current
materials to be replaced by materials showing higher
performance for users, and address the challenges of improved
energy efficiency, lower environmental impact and toxicity, better
management of their life cycle and waste recovery;

— developing, industrializing and improving first-level competitive
processes for the conversion of oil, gas, coal and biomass

3.1. Upstream

resources to adapt to changes in resources and markets,
improve reliability and safety, achieve better energy efficiency,
reduce the environmental footprint and maintain the Group’s
economic margins in the long term;

— understanding and measuring the impacts of the Group's
operations and products on ecosystems (water, soil, air, biodiversity)
and recovering waste to improve environmental safety, as part of
the regulation in place, and reduce their environmental footprint
to achieve sustainability in the Group’s operations; and

— mastering and using innovative technologies such as
biotechnologies, materials sciences, nanotechnologies, high-
performance computing, information and communications
technologies or new analytic techniques.

These issues are addressed within a portfolio of projects in order to
capture synergies. Various aspects may be looked at independently
by different divisions.

The portfolio managed by the entity tasked with developing small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) specialized in innovative
energy technologies and cleantechs has grown regularly since 2009.
In addition, a loan facility was introduced for innovative SMEs that
develop technologies of interest for the Group.

In Exploration & Production, in addition to continuously optimizing
the development of deep offshore projects and gas resources,
TOTAL continues to improve its exploration, seismic acquisition and
imagery technologies over the long term as well as those for the
initial appraisal of hydrocarbon reservoirs and simulation of field
evolution during operations, especially for tight, very deep or
carbonate reservoirs.

Anew direction is being taken to carry out deep offshore
operations in even deeper waters, on the one hand, and at greater
distances for multiphase production transport, on the other hand,
which is fully in line with the ambitious goals of

Exploration & Production and supports major technology-intensive
assets such as Libra in Brazil.

Enhancing oil recovery from mature reservoirs and recovery of
heavy oil and bitumen with lower environmental impacts are also
subjects involving active research.

R&D activity has been intensified in the field of unconventional
resources, with a strong focus on water management throughout

the production cycle and the search for alternatives to hydraulic
fracking. In addition, new technologies for the exploitation of oil
shales by pyrolysis are being developed, both in situ and ex situ.

The CO, oxycombustion capture and storage project in the
depleted Rousse reservoir in Lacq (France) is now in the monitoring
phase following the injection phase, which ended in April 2013. The
Group now has a strong command of the methods used to
characterize reservoirs for this type of injection. New projects will
look into new capturing solutions.

Finally, R&D continues to devote considerable efforts to
technologies for water management associated to the production
of hydrocarbons. This subject is now part of a larger program
dedicated to sustainable development.

In Gas & Power, the program to develop new LNG (Liquefied
Natural Gas) solutions is ongoing.

3.2. Refining & Chemicals

3.2.1. Refining & Chemicals (excluding
Specialty Chemicals)

The aim of R&D is to support the medium and long-term development
of Refining & Chemicals. In doing so, it contributes to the
technological differentiation of this business through the development,
implementation and promotion of effective R&D programs that pave
the way for the industrialization of knowledge, processes and
technologies.

In line with Refining & Chemicals’ strategy, R&D places special
emphasis on the following four major challenges: take advantage of
different types of feedstock, optimize the value of assets, continue
to develop innovative products, and develop bio-sourced products.
The medium-term strategy of the project portfolio and its deployment
plan will facilitate Refining & Chemicals’ technological differentiation.

To take advantage of different types of feedstock, R&D activities
related to the processing of more diversified crudes have increased
significantly through a better understanding of the effect that
feedstocks have on equipment and processes at the molecular
level. R&D is launching ambitious new programs to develop various
technologies for producing liquid fuels, monomers and intermediates
from gas.

R&D is developing know-how and technologies with a view to
optimizing the value of assets. Its efforts mainly involve programs
focusing on the flexibility and availability of facilities. Advanced
modeling of feedstocks and processes helps the units overcome
their processing-related constraints and operate in real time with
these constraints in mind. Research conducted on catalysts is
helping to increase their resistance to poisons, improve catalytic
stability and extend cycle time at a lower cost. Programs are being
set up to maximize the value of heavy residues.

In response to concerns related to social and environmental
acceptability, R&D focuses its efforts on reducing emissions, with
the aim of ensuring that the facilities’ environmental impact is
limited. In anticipation of problems that arise over the long term
and the value of CO,, R&D is developing technologies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions through carbon capture and recovery
by conversion.

Product innovation is a key aspect of research on polymers. R&D.
draws on its knowledge of metallocenes and bimodality to develop

3.3. Marketing & Services

different types of mass consumption polymers which have
exceptional properties that allow them to replace heavier materials
and compete with technical polymers. Value-added niche polymers
are also being developed, whether in the form of blends,
compounds or composites. Efforts to diversify into “green”
products are focused mainly on bioproducts endorsed by the
market: biomonomers, biointermediates and biopolymers. R&D is
banking on polylactic acid for the market launch of new polymers
that boast improved properties. In addition, the development of
blends, compounds and composites broadens the scope of
application of polylactic acid-based polymers.

With regard to biofuels, R&D has focused its efforts on gasification
and coprocessing to produce liquid fuels from biomass. R&D is also
particularly mindful of issues related to blends and product quality
raised by the use of biomolecules.

The efficient use of resources and the management of plastics at
the end of their useful life are topics of growing interest. R&D is
therefore developing technologies that enable plastics to be used
more efficiently as feedstock.

3.2.2. Specialty Chemicals

R&D has strategic importance for Specialty Chemicals. It is closely
linked to the needs of subsidiaries and industrial customers.

Material innovation at Hutchinson is opening up new growth
opportunities: development of advanced rubber or thermoplastic
formulas, development of new material formulations based on
composite structures, or thermal applications.

In addition, growth and R&D focus on topics such as weight
reduction, more electric vehicles, mechatronics and energy
efficiency. Hutchinson set up two new platforms in 2014 within its
research center: CTeC dedicated to composite structures, and
MHuST dedicated to embedded mechatronic developments.

Atotech is one of the world leaders in integrated production
systems (chemicals, equipment, know-how and service) for
industrial surface finishing and the manufacturing of integrated
circuits. Given the environmental challenges related to
electroplating, nearly half of Atotech’s R&D projects are intended to
develop cleaner technologies and create conditions for the
sustainable development of these industries.

3.3.1. Marketing & Services

In 2014, Marketing & Services’ R&D fine-tuned its roadmap in line
with its ambitions and revised its internal organization.

Two major thematic platforms were identified: reducing the
environmental footprint of products and improving the durability of
its end users’ equipment. They include the following development
work: fuel economy for customers (fuels, lubricants, additives),
competitiveness and new offers (lubricants, bitumens, special
fluids), anticipation of regulatory developments (marine lubricants,
aviation lubricants), and incorporation of bio-sourced molecules
(lubricants, racing fuels).

Fundamental research provides the ideas necessary for designing
and developing breakthrough products, which are one of the
objectives that Marketing & Services has set for R&D. International
secondments were put in place for the first time to incorporate the
best scientific expertise into Marketing & Services’ know-how.

The number of international scientific cooperations grew sharply in
2014, and several researchers of foreign nationalities were recruited
for the Solaize Research Center.

The Technical Center of Asia-Pacific, based in India, yielded results
for the first time in 2014, mainly for lubricants, but also for special
fluids, bitumens, fuel additives and fuels themselves. It is also the global


--- Page 68 ---

In 2014, the development of a new Excellium fuel formulas was
completed and the benefits for customers were demonstrated.
These developments focused on “engine cleanliness” and
incorporate a new detergent technology developed internally.
UTAC-CERAM Group’s assessment of the Excellium formula on
trucks, in compliance with the Energy Economy Certificate (CEE)
protocol, showed a 4% consumption savings.

The results produced by Excellium development work also served
as basis for the new Total Traction Premier formulation developed
for Total France.

In the field of refining specification additives, new block copolymers
were synthesized to improve the cold flow properties of distillates at
low temperatures.

The Fue! Economy range of lubricants continues to expand with
many new products added to comply with the specifications of
manufacturers targeted by the Total Lubricants business line in all
fields of application (automotive, marine and industries). New
marine lubricants for two-stroke engines are being developed to
anticipate changes in fuel (very low sulfur in coastal areas) and
emissions requirements. Research in lubricants also seeks to drive
international development and the growth of the volume of
lubricants sold. The number of manufacturers whose engines are
being installed on the research center's engine test benches for the
assessment of their lubricants is growing constantly with a peak for
German manufacturers in 2014.

To meet the challenges of competitiveness, sustainable logistics
and geographic development, researchers focused on optimizing
bitumen formulas for roads, undertaking studies on the possibility of
transporting bitumen in solid form and developing Styrelf formulas
in Russia. Work on the formulation and industrialization of a
specialty bitumen for industrial application was pursued successfully.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has selected the
proposed unleaded Avgas, which will be assessed comparatively
with three other competing proposals.

With a better understanding of the fluid catalytic production
process and its applications, new patent applications were filed.

Lastly, thanks to their know-how and responsiveness, the
researchers achieved success in racing fuels by developing

3.4. Environment

products suitable for the new Renault V6 Formula 1 engine,
particularly fuels containing biohydrocarbons which were
instrumental in the victories at the Canadian, Belgian and Hungarian
Grands Prix.

3.3.2. New Energies

New Energies’ R&D effort is focused on the solar value chain from
silicon to photovoltaic electricity management systems and on the
development of biotechnological methods of converting biomass
into products for the Group’s markets.

In the field of solar energy, R&D is striving to improve SunPower’s
methods of producing cells and modules, in order to reduce costs
while enhancing their efficiency and reliability. It is also preparing
future generation photovoltaic cells within the framework of several
strategic partnerships between TOTAL and renowned academic
research institutes. In particular, TOTAL is the founding partner of
the lle de France Photovoltaic Institute, an ambitious project set up
in the Paris-Saclay campus.

Downstream in the solar value chain, R&D is monitoring the
development of low-cost stationary storage technologies. It is also
preparing solutions for supplying solar power and associated
services to residential markets, by developing software tools and
algorithms for the intelligent management of domestic electricity
production and consumption, but also by integrating and testing
systems combining photovoltaics, storage, control of demand as
well as pilots for assessing and improving systems and algorithms
in contact with customers.

With regard to biotechnologies, the Group is developing methods
for converting sugars into biofuels and molecules of interest for
chemicals, as well as processes for the deconstruction of
lignocellulose into sugars. The Group has set up its own
laboratories, including a competence center on fermentation and a
joint laboratory with Marketing & Services devoted to bio-sourced
specialties, and a dedicated research team. This research team
manages a network of partnerships with research laboratories and
startups in the United States and in Europe. The Group's leading
partner is Amyris, a U.S. company listed on the NASDAQ, in which
the Group held a 17.23% stake as of December 31, 2014.

Environmental issues are important throughout the Group and are taken
into account in all R&D projects. R&D’s effort is to ensure optimum
management of environmental risk, particularly with regard to:

— water management, notably by reducing the use of water from
natural continental environments and by lowering emissions in
compliance with local, national and international regulations;

— reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy
efficiency and the monitoring of carbon capture and storage and
the potential effects of CO. on the natural environment;

— detection and reduction of discharges into the air and simulation
of their dissemination;

— prevention of soil contamination and regulatory compliance with
regard to historical aspects and the remediation of sites; and

— changes in the Group’s different products and management of
their life cycle, in particular in compliance with the Registration,
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Directive
(REACH).

Refer to point 2.2. of chapter 7 for more details.

3.5. R&D organization

The Group intends to increase R&D in all of its sectors through
cross-functional themes and technologies. Attention is paid to
synergies of R&D efforts between business units.

The Group has twenty-two R&D sites worldwide and has
developed approximately 1,000 partnerships with other industrial
groups and academic or highly specialized research institutes.
TOTAL also has a permanently renewed network of scientific
advisors worldwide who monitor and advise on matters of interest

4. Trends and outlook

4.1. Outlook

to the Group’s R&D activities. Long-term partnerships with
universities and academic laboratories, deemed strategic in Europe,
the United States, Japan and China, as well as innovative SMEs are
part of the Group’s approach.

Each segment is developing an active intellectual property activity,
aimed at protecting its innovations, allowing its activity to develop
without constraints as well as facilitating its partnerships. In 2014,
more than 300 new patent applications were filed by the Group.

In response to the recent fall in the oil price, TOTAL has launched
an ambitious mitigation plan. The plan includes significant reductions
to organic investments", operating costs and the exploration
budget, as well as an acceleration of its asset sale program.

The Group plans to lower its organic investments by more than
10% from $26.4 billion in 2014 to $23-24 billion in 2015, by
reducing investments in brownfield developments that have
become less profitable. For operating costs, the 3-year program
targeting savings of $2 billion in 2017 has been reinforced in the
Upstream segment from 2015. The initial target of $800 million has
been raised to $1.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 50%. The
exploration budget has been reduced by about 30%, to $1.9 billion
in 2015.

Having achieved its 2012-14 asset sale target of $15-20 billion,
TOTAL plans to accelerate its 2015-17 asset sale program of $10
billion by selling $5 billion of assets in 2015, in addition to benefiting
from the completion of about $4 billion of asset sales that were
already signed and pending at the start of the year.

In the Upstream segment, the Group is focused on the execution
and delivery of its major projects and plans eight start-ups this year,

4.2. Risks and uncertainties

of which three already started production in January. These start-ups,
plus the new ADCO volumes, will contribute to production growth
for the Group of more than 8% in 2015.

In addition, refining overcapacity remains an issue in Europe, and
the Group is progressing in its restructuring plans by launching a
capacity reduction program at its Lindsey refinery in the United Kingdom
and will announce a new plan for its refining activities in France in
the spring of 2015.

With the decline in oil prices, the petroleum industry has entered a
new cycle. In this context, TOTAL is implementing a strong and
immediate response generating $8 billion in cash in 2015, thereby
reducing its cash break-even point by 40 $/b without compromising
the priority to safety.

Finally, despite intensive investments made for future growth, the
Group’s balance sheet remains strong, allowing it access to
financial markets under very favorable conditions.

As it has demonstrated in the past, TOTAL will make the
adjustments necessary to successfully adapt to this period of low
prices, while at the same time being prepared to take advantage of
a recovery, for the benefit of its shareholders.

Due to the nature of its business, the Group’s activities remain subject
to the usual market risks (sensitivity to the environmental parameters
of the oil and financial markets), industrial and environmental risks
related to its operations, and to political or geopolitical risks
stemming from the global presence of most of its activities.

Risks relative to cash management operations and to interest rate
and foreign exchange financial instruments are managed according

to rules set by the Group’s General Management, which provide for
regular pooling of available cash balances, open positions and
management of the financial instruments.

Detailed information is given in the Risk Factors section (chapter 4)
of this Registration Document. For more information, also refer to
the Chairman's report in point 1.10. of chapter 5.

5. Significant changes

On January 29, 2015, TOTAL acquired a 10% stake in the new
ADCO concession in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) for a forty-
year period starting from January 1, 2015. It covers the fifteen main
onshore fields in Abu Dhabi and represents more than half of the
Emirate’s production. TOTAL has been appointed Asset Leader for
the Bu Hasa field and the Southeast group of fields (covering Sahil,
Asab, Shah, Qusahwira and Mender fields), which represent
approximately two-thirds of ADCO’s production. In 2015, ADCO’s
entire production is expected to be approximately 1.6 million barrels
per day (Mb/d), with an objective to increase output to 1.8 Mb/d
from 2017. As the first international company to enter the new ADCO.
concession in Abu Dhabi, TOTAL demonstrates its ability to access
resources under good conditions and create strong partnerships in
a strategic region with numerous development opportunities.

On February 2, 2015, TOTAL completed the sale of its adhesive
subsidiary Bostik to Arkema. The accounting effects of this sale,
which occurred after the close of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 will be reflected
in TOTAL S.A.’s intermediate Consolidated Financial Statements for
the first quarter of 2015.

Except for the events mentioned above in the Management Report
(chapter 3), in the Business overview (chapter 2), or in the
description of legal and arbitration procedures (point 4. of chapter
4), no significant changes in the Group’s financial or commercial
position have occurred since December 31, 2014, the end of the
last fiscal year for which audited financial statements have been
published by the Company.

1. Financial risks

Financial risks are detailed in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (point 7. of chapter 10).

1.1. Sensitivity to market environment

The financial performance of TOTAL is sensitive to a number of
factors, the most significant being crude oil and natural gas prices,
refining margins and exchange rates, in particular that of the dollar
versus the euro.

Generally, a rise in the price of crude oil has a positive effect on
earnings as a result of an increase in revenues from oil and gas
production. Conversely, a decline in crude oil prices reduces
revenues. For the year 2015, according to the scenarios retained,
the Group estimates that an increase or decrease of $10 per barrel
in the price of Brent crude would respectively increase or decrease
the annual adjusted net operating income by approximately $1.7 billion
and cash flow from operations by approximately $2 billion. The impact
of changes in crude oil prices on downstream operations depends
upon the speed at which the prices of finished products adjust

to reflect these changes. The Group estimates that an increase

or decrease in its European Refining Margin Indicator (ERMI) of

$1.00 per ton would increase or decrease annual adjusted
net operating income by approximately $0.05 billion and cash flow
from operations by approximately $0.07 billion.

All of the Group’s activities are, to various degrees, sensitive to
fluctuations in the dollar/euro exchange rate. The Group estimates
that a decrease of 0.10 dollars per euro (strengthening of the dollar
versus the euro) would increase adjusted net operating income by
approximately $0.2 billion, and vice versa, while the impact on cash
flow from operations is estimated to be not significant.

The Group’s results, particularly in the Chemicals activity, also
depend on the overall economic environment.

The year 2014 was marked by a sharp oil price decline in the
second half, which continued in early 2015. For more detailed
information on this oil price decline and its impact on the Group's
2014 results, financial position and outlook, refer to chapter 3.

Market Scenario Change Estimated impact Estimated impact

European refining margin (ERMI) 25 $/t +1 S/t 0.08 BS 0.05 BS

(a) Sensitivities revised once per year upon publication of the previous year's fourth quarter results. Indicated sensitivities are approximate and based upon TOTAL's current view of its 2015,
portfolio. Results may differ significantly from the estimates implied by the application of these sensitivities. The impact of the €-$ sensitivity on adjusted operating income attributable to
the Exploration & Production segment is 60%. The impact of the €-S sensitivity on net adjusted operating income attributable to the Refining & Chemicals segment is 90%.

1.2. Oil and gas market related risks

Due to the nature of its business, the Group has significant oil and
gas trading activities as part of its day-to-day operations in order to
optimize revenues from its oil and gas production and to obtain
favorable pricing to supply its refineries.

In its international oil trading business, the Group follows a policy of
not selling its future production. However, in connection with this
trading business, the Group, like most other oil companies, uses
energy derivative instruments to adjust its exposure to price fluctuations
of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, power and coal. The Group
also uses freight rate derivative contracts in its shipping business to
adjust its exposure to freight-rate fluctuations. To hedge against this
risk, the Group uses various instruments such as futures, forwards,
swaps and options on organized markets or over-the-counter markets.
The list of the different derivatives held by the Group in these markets
is detailed in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Trading & Shipping division measures its market risk exposure,
i.e. potential loss in fair values, on its crude oil, refined products and
freight rates trading activities using a value-at-risk technique. This
technique is based on an historical model and makes an assessment
of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market
values over a 24-hour period. The calculation of the range of potential
changes in fair values takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day
exposures and the set of historical price movements for the last
400 business days for all instruments and maturities in the global
trading activities. Options are systematically re-evaluated using
appropriate models.

The potential movement in fair values corresponds to a 97.5%
value-at-risk type confidence level. This means that the Group’s
portfolio result is likely to exceed the value-at-risk loss measure once
over 40 business days if the portfolio exposures were left unchanged.

2013 12.9 45 8.2 9.8
2012 16.1 49 9.5 7.2

As part of its gas, power and coal trading activity, the Group also
uses derivative instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps and
options in both organized and over-the-counter markets. In general,
the transactions are settled at maturity date through physical
delivery. The Gas & Power division measures its market risk
exposure, /.e. potential loss in fair values, on its trading business
using a value-at-risk technique. This technique is based on an

historical model and makes an assessment of the market risk arising
from possible future changes in market values over a one-day
period. The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair
values takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures
and the set of historical price movements for the past two years for

(M$) High Low Average Year end
2014 15.4 3.2 6.0 4.0
2013 11.4 3.0 5.8 6.2

The Group has implemented strict policies and procedures to manage
and monitor these market risks. These are based on the separation of
the control and front-office functions, and on an integrated information
system that enables real-time monitoring of trading activities.

Limits on trading positions are approved by the Group’s Executive
Committee and are monitored daily. To increase flexibility and

1.3. Financial markets related risks

encourage liquidity, hedging operations are performed with
numerous independent operators, including other oil companies,
major energy producers or consumers and financial institutions.
The Group has established counterparty limits and monitors
outstanding amounts with each counterparty on an ongoing basis.

As part of its financing and cash management activities, the Group
uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to changes in
interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These instruments are
mainly interest rate and currency swaps. The Group may also
occasionally use futures contracts and options. These operations
and their accounting treatment are detailed in Notes 1 paragraph
M, 20, 28 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risks relative to cash management operations and to interest rate
and foreign exchange financial instruments are managed according
to rules set by the Group’s senior management, which provide for
regular pooling of available cash balances, open positions and
management of the financial instruments by the Treasury Department.

Excess cash of the Group is deposited mainly in government
institutions, deposit banks, or major companies through deposits,
reverse repurchase agreements and purchase of commercial paper.
Liquidity positions and the management of financial instruments are
centralized by the Treasury Department, where they are managed
by a team specialized in foreign exchange and interest rate market
transactions.

The Cash Monitoring-Management Unit within the Treasury Department
monitors limits and positions per bank on a daily basis and results
of the Front Office. This unit also prepares marked-to-market
valuations of used financial instruments and, when necessary,
performs sensitivity analysis.

1.4. Counterparty risk

The Group has established standards for market transactions under
which bank counterparties must be approved in advance, based on
an assessment of the counterparty’s financial soundness (multi-criteria

analysis including a review of market prices and of the Credit Default
Swap (CDS), its ratings with Standard & Poor's and Moody's, which
must be of high quality, and its overall financial condition).

1.5. Currency exposure

An overall authorized credit limit is set for each bank and is allotted
among the subsidiaries and the Group's central treasury entities
according to their needs.

To reduce the risk of market value on its commitments, in particular
for swaps set as part of bonds issuance, the Treasury Department
also concluded margin call contracts with significant counterparties.

The Group generally seeks to minimize the currency exposure of
each entity to its functional currency (primarily the dollar, the euro,
the pound sterling and the Norwegian krone).

For currency exposure generated by commercial activity, the hedging
of revenues and costs in foreign currencies is typically performed
using currency operations on the spot market and, in some cases,
on the forward market. The Group rarely hedges future cash flows,
although it may use options to do so.

With respect to currency exposure linked to non-current assets,
the Group has a hedging policy of financing these assets in their
functional currency.

Net short-term currency exposure is periodically monitored against
limits set by the Group’s senior management.

The non-current debt described in Note 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements is generally raised by the Corporate treasury
entities either directly in dollars or in euros, or in other currencies
which are then exchanged for dollars or euros through swaps
issues to appropriately match general corporate needs. The proceeds
from these debt issuances are loaned to affiliates whose accounts
are kept in dollars or in euros. Thus, the net sensitivity of these
positions to currency exposure is not significant.

The Group's short-term currency swaps, the notional value of which
appears in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are
used to attempt to optimize the centralized cash management of the
Group. Thus, the sensitivity to currency fluctuations which may be
induced is likewise considered negligible.

1.6. Short-term interest rate exposure and cash

Cash balances, which are primarily composed of euros and dollars,
are managed according to the guidelines established by the

Group’s senior management (maintain an adequate level of liquidity,
optimize revenue from investments considering existing interest rate

1.7. Interest rate risk on non-current debt

yield curves, and minimize the cost of borrowing) over a less than
twelve-month horizon and on the basis of a daily interest rate
benchmark, primarily through short-term interest rate swaps and
short-term currency swaps, without modifying currency exposure.

The Group’s policy consists of incurring non-current debt primarily
at a floating rate, or, if the opportunity arises at the time of an issuance,
at a fixed rate. Debt is incurred in dollars or in euros according to
general corporate needs. Long-term interest rate and currency

swaps may be used to hedge bonds at their issuance in order

to create a variable or fixed rate synthetic debt. In order to partially
modify the interest rate structure of the long-term debt, TOTAL may
also enter into long-term interest rate swaps.

1.8. Sensitivity analysis on interest rate and foreign exchange risk

The tables below present the potential impact of an increase or
decrease of 10 basis points on the interest rate yield curves for

each of the currencies on the fair value of the current financial
instruments as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.

As a result of the policy for the management of currency exposure previously described, the Group’s sensitivity to currency exposure is primarily
influenced by the net equity of the subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro and the ruble, and to a lesser extent, the pound sterling

and the Norwegian krone.

This sensitivity is reflected in the historical evolution of the currency translation adjustment recorded in the statement of changes in consolidated
shareholders’ equity which, over the course of the last three years, is essentially related to the fluctuation of the euro, the ruble and the pound

sterling and is set forth in the table below:

1.9. Stock market risk

The Group holds interests in a number of publicly-traded companies
(see Notes 12 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
The market value of these holdings fluctuates due to various

1.10. Liquidity risk

factors, including stock market trends, valuations of the sectors
in which the companies operate, and the economic and financial
condition of each individual company.

TOTAL S.A. has confirmed lines of credit granted by international
banks, which are calculated to allow it to manage its short-term
liquidity needs as required.

As of December 31, 2014, these lines of credit amounted

to $10,514 million, of which $10,514 million was unused.

The agreements for the lines of credit granted to TOTAL S.A. do
not contain conditions related to the Company's financial ratios, to
its financial ratings from specialized agencies, or to the occurrence
of events that could have a material adverse effect on its financial
position. As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate amount of the

principal confirmed lines of credit granted by international banks to
Group companies, including TOTAL S.A., was $11,064 million, of
which $10,764 million was unused. The lines of credit granted to
Group companies other than TOTAL S.A. are not intended to finance
the Group’s general needs; they are intended to finance either the
general needs of the borrowing subsidiary or a specific project.

The following tables show the maturity of the financial assets and
liabilities of the Group as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
(see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition, the Group guarantees bank debt and finance lease
obligations of certain non-consolidated companies and equity
affiliates. A payment would be triggered by failure of the guaranteed
party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee, and no assets
are held as collateral for these guarantees. Maturity dates and
amounts are set forth in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements (“Guarantees given against borrowings”).

As of December 31
(Ms)

The Group also guarantees the current liabilities of certain
non-consolidated companies. Performance under these guarantees
would be triggered by a financial default of these entities. Maturity
dates and amounts are set forth in Note 23 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements (“Guarantees of current liabilities”).

The following table sets forth financial assets and liabilities related
to operating activities as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
(see Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Assets/(Liabilities) 2014 2013 2012
Accounts payable (24,150) (30,282) (28,563)

including financial instruments related to commodity contracts 2,502 1,278 899
Total (5,589) (5,134) (2,882)

These financial assets and liabilities mainly have a maturity date below one year.

1.11. Credit risk

Credit risk is defined as the risk of the counterparty to a contract failing to perform or pay the amounts due.

The Group is exposed to credit risks in its operating and financing activities. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is partially related
to financial assets recorded on its balance sheet, including energy derivative instruments that have a positive market value.

The following table presents the Group’s maximum credit risk exposure:

As of December 31
(Ms)

Assets/(Liabilities) 2014 2013 2012
Loans to equity affiliates (Note 12) 4,626 3,554 3,114
Loans and advances (Note 14) 3,326 3,575 2,912

Cash and cash equivalents (Note 27) 25,181 20,200 20,409
Total 62,241 62,825 64,106

The valuation allowance on loans and advances and on accounts
receivable and other operating receivables is detailed respectively
in Notes 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As part of its credit risk management related to operating and
financing activities, the Group has developed margin call contracts
with certain counterparties. As of December 31, 2014, the net
amount received as part of these margin calls was $1,437 million
(compared to $1,105 million as of December 31, 2013 and
$2,157 million as of December 31, 2012).

The Group has established a number of programs for the sale of trade
receivables, without recourse, with various banks, primarily to reduce
its exposure to such receivables. As a result of these programs the
Group retains no risk of payment default after the sale, but may
continue to service the customer accounts as part of a service

arrangement on behalf of the buyer and is required to pay to the buyer
payments it receives from the customers relating to the receivables
sold. As of December 31, 2014, the net value of receivables sold
amounted to $3,036 million. No financial asset or liability remains
recognized in the consolidated balance sheet after the date of sale.

Credit risk is managed by the Group’s business segments as follows:
Upstream segment
- Exploration & Production

Risks arising under contracts with government authorities or other
oil companies or under long-term supply contracts necessary for
the development of projects are evaluated during the project
approval process. The long-term aspect of these contracts and
the high-quality of the other parties lead to a low level of credit risk.


--- Page 79 ---

Risks related to commercial operations, other than those described
above (which are, in practice, directly monitored by subsidiaries),
are subject to procedures for establishing and reviewing credit.

Customer receivables are subject to provisions on a case-by-
case basis, based on prior history and management's assessment
of the facts and circumstances.

- Gas & Power

Gas & Power deals with counterparties in the energy, industrial
and financial sectors throughout the world. Financial institutions
providing credit risk coverage are highly rated international bank
and insurance groups.

Potential counterparties are subject to credit assessment and
approval before concluding transactions and are thereafter subject
to regular review, including re-appraisal and approval of the limits
previously granted.

The creditworthiness of counterparties is assessed based on an
analysis of quantitative and qualitative data regarding financial
standing and business risks, together with the review of any
relevant third party and market information, such as data published
by rating agencies. On this basis, credit limits are defined for
each potential counterparty and, where appropriate, transactions
are subject to specific authorizations.

Credit exposure, which is essentially an economic exposure or
an expected future physical exposure, is permanently monitored
and subject to sensitivity measures.

Credit risk is mitigated by the systematic use of industry standard
contractual frameworks that permit netting, enable requiring added
security in case of adverse change in the counterparty risk, and
allow for termination of the contract upon occurrence of certain
events of default.

Refining & Chemicals segment
- Refining & Chemicals

Credit risk is primarily related to commercial receivables.

Internal procedures of Refining & Chemicals include rules for the
management of credit describing the fundamentals of internal
control in this domain. Each division implements procedures for
managing and provisioning credit risk that differ based on the
size of the subsidiary and the market in which it operates.

The principal elements of these procedures are:

- implementation of credit limits with different authorization
procedures for possible credit overruns,

- use of insurance policies or specific guarantees (letters of credit),

- regular monitoring and assessment of overdue accounts (aging
balance), including collection procedures, and

- provisioning of bad debts on a customer-by-customer basis,
according to payment delays and local payment practices
(provisions may also be calculated based on statistics).

Counterparties are subject to credit assessment and approval
prior to any transaction being concluded. Regular reviews

are made for all active counterparties including a re-appraisal
and renewing of the granted credit limits. The limits of the
counterparties are assessed based on quantitative and qualitative
data regarding financial standing, together with the review of any
relevant third party and market information, such as that provided
by rating agencies and insurance companies.

- Trading & Shipping

Trading & Shipping deals with commercial counterparties and
financial institutions located throughout the world. Counterparties
to physical and derivative transactions are primarily entities
involved in the oil and gas industry or in the trading of energy
commodities, or financial institutions. Credit risk coverage is
concluded with financial institutions, international banks and
insurance groups selected in accordance with strict criteria.

Trading & Shipping has a strict policy of internal delegation of
authority governing establishment of country and counterparty
credit limits and approval of specific transactions. Credit
exposures contracted under these limits and approvals are
monitored on a daily basis.

Potential counterparties are subject to credit assessment and
approval prior to any transaction being concluded and all active
counterparties are subject to regular reviews, including re-appraisal
and approval of granted limits. The creditworthiness of counterparties
is assessed based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative
data regarding financial standing and business risks, together
with the review of any relevant third party and market information,
such as ratings published by Standard & Poor's, Moody's and
other agencies.

Contractual arrangements are structured so as to maximize the risk
mitigation benefits of netting between transactions wherever
possible and additional protective terms providing for the provision
of security in the event of financial deterioration and the termination
of transactions on the occurrence of defined default events are
used to the greatest permitted extent.

Credit risks in excess of approved levels are secured by means
of letters of credit and other guarantees, cash deposits and
insurance arrangements. In respect of derivative transactions,
risks are secured by margin call contracts wherever possible.

Marketing & Services segment

Internal procedures for the Marketing & Services division include
rules on credit risk that describe the basis of internal control in this
domain, including the separation of authority between commercial
and financial operations. Credit policies are defined at the local level,
complemented by the implementation of procedures to monitor
customer risk (credit committees at the subsidiary level, the creation
of credit limits for corporate customers, portfolio guarantees, etc.).

Each entity also implements monitoring of its outstanding receivables.
Risks related to credit may be mitigated or limited by subscription
of credit insurance and/or requiring security or guarantees.

Bad debts are provisioned on a case-by-case basis at a rate
determined by management based on an assessment of the risk
of credit loss.

2. Industrial and environmental risks

2.1. Types of risks

TOTAL is exposed to risks related to the safety and security
of its operations.

TOTAL engages in a broad range of industrial activities, including,
in particular, drilling, oil and gas production, processing,
transportation, refining and petrochemical activities, storage and
distribution of petroleum products, specialty chemicals and solar
energy. These activities involve a wide range of operational risks,
such as explosions, fires, accidents, equipment failures, leakage
of toxic products, emissions or discharges into the air, water or soil,
and related environmental and health risks. In the transportation
area, the type of risk depends not only on the hazardous nature of
the products transported, but also on the transportation methods
used (mainly maritime, river-maritime, rail, road and pipelines), the
volumes involved and the sensitivity of the regions through which
the transport passes (quality of infrastructure, population density,
environmental considerations). Moreover, most of the Group’s
activities will eventually require environmental site remediation,
closure and decommissioning after operations are discontinued.

The industrial events that could have the most significant impact
are primarily:

— amajor industrial accident (fire, explosion, leakage of highly
toxic products); and

— large-scale accidental pollution or pollution at a particularly
sensitive site.

Each of the described risks corresponds to events that could
potentially cause death, harm human health, damage property,
disrupt business activities or cause environmental damage. The
Group’s employees, contractors, residents living near the facilities
or customers can suffer injuries. Property damage can involve
the facilities of the Group as well as the property of third parties.
The seriousness of the consequences of these events varies
according to the vulnerability of the people, ecosystems and
business activities impacted, on the one hand, and the number
of people in the impact area and the location of the ecosystems
and business activities in relation to TOTAL's facilities or to the
trajectory of the products after the event, on the other hand.

Acts of terrorism against the Group’s plants and sites, pipelines,
transportation and computer systems could also severely disrupt
business activities and could cause harm to people, the
environment and property.

Like most industrial groups, TOTAL is affected by reports of
occupational illnesses, particularly those caused by past exposure
of the Group’s employees to asbestos. Asbestos exposure has
been subject to close monitoring at all of the Group’s business
segments. As of December 31, 2014, the Group estimates that the
ultimate cost of all pending or future asbestos-related claims is not
likely to have a material impact on the Group's financial position.

Certain segments or activities of the Group face specific additional risks.

TOTAL’s Upstream segment faces, notably, risks related to the
physical characteristics of oil and gas fields. These risks include
eruptions of oil or gas, discovery of hydrocarbon pockets with

abnormal pressure, crumbling of well openings, leaks that can harm
the environment and explosions or fires. These events, which may
cause death, injury or environmental damage, can also damage or
destroy oil or gas wells as well as equipment and other property,
lead to a disruption of the Group’s operations or reduce its production.
In addition, since exploration and production activities may take
place on sites that are ecologically sensitive (for example, in tropical
forests or in a marine environment), each site requires a risk-based
approach to avoid or minimize the impact on human health, flora and
fauna, the ecosystem and biodiversity. In certain situations where the
operator is not a Group entity, the Group may have reduced influence
and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage
and control these risks.

The activities of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services
business segments also entail additional health, safety and
environmental risks related to the overall life cycle of the products
manufactured, as well as the materials used in the manufacturing
process, such as catalysts, additives and monomers. These risks
can arise from the intrinsic characteristics of the products involved
(flammability, toxicity or long-term environmental impacts such as
greenhouse gas emissions), their use (including by customers),
emissions and discharges resulting from their manufacturing
process (such as greenhouse gas emissions), and from material
and waste disposal (recycling, regeneration or other processes,

or waste elimination).

Contracts signed by the Group's entities may provide for indemnification
obligations either by TOTAL in favor of the contractor or third parties
or by the contractor or third parties in favor of TOTAL if, for example,
an event occurs leading to death, personal injury or property or
environmental damage.

With respect to joint ventures in which an entity of the Group has an
interest and the assets of which are operated by such Group entity
under an operating agreement between the joint venture and such
entity, contractual terms generally provide that the operator assumes
full liability for damages caused by its gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

With respect to joint ventures in which an entity of the Group has an
interest but the assets of which are operated by a third party, contractual
terms generally provide that the operator assumes full liability for
damages caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In the absence of the operator's gross negligence or willful misconduct,
other liabilities are generally borne by the joint venture and the cost

thereof is assumed by the partners of the joint venture in proportion
to their respective ownership interests.

With respect to third-party providers of goods and services, the amount
and nature of the liability assumed by the third party depends on the
context and may be limited by contract. With respect to their customers,
the Group's entities ensure that their products meet applicable
specifications and abide by all applicable consumer protection laws.
Failure to do so could lead to personal injury, environmental harm
and loss of customers, which could negatively impact the Group's
results of operations, financial position and reputation.

Crisis management systems are necessary to respond
effectively to emergencies, avoid potential disruptions

in TOTAL’s business and operations and minimize impacts
on third parties and the environment.

TOTAL has crisis management plans in place to deal with emergencies.
However, these plans cannot exclude the risk that the Group's business
and operations may be severely disrupted in a crisis situation or ensure
the absence of impacts on third parties or the environment. TOTAL
also has implemented business continuity plans in order to continue or
resume operations following a shutdown or incident. An inability to
restore or replace critical capacity in a timely manner could prolong the
impact of any disruption and could have a material adverse effect on
the Group's business and operations. For more information on the
Group’s crisis management systems, see point 2.2.3. below.

TOTAL is subject to stringent environmental, health and safety
laws in numerous countries and may incur material costs to
comply with these laws and regulations.

TOTAL’s workforce and the public are exposed to risks inherent to
the Group's operations that potentially could lead to loss of life, injuries,
property damage or environmental damage and could result in
regulatory action and legal liability against the entities of the Group
and its officers as well as damage to the Group’s reputation.

TOTAL incurs, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures
to comply with increasingly complex laws and regulations aimed at
protecting health, safety and the environment.

These expenditures include:

— costs incurred to prevent, control, eliminate or reduce certain
types of air and water emissions, including those costs incurred
in connection with measures taken to address climate change;

— remedial measures related to environmental contamination or
accidents at various sites, including those owned by third parties;

— indemnification of individuals or entities claiming damages
caused by accidents or by the Group’s activities;

— increased production costs and costs related to changes in
product specifications; and

— costs related to the decommissioning of drilling platforms
and other facilities.

Such expenditures could have a material effect on the results
of operations of the Group and its financial position.

Furthermore, in countries where the Group operates or plans to
operate, the introduction of new laws and regulations, stricter
enforcement or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations
or the imposition of tougher license requirements may also cause
the Group's entities to incur higher costs resulting from actions
taken to comply with such laws and regulations, including:

— modifying operations;

installing complementary pollution control equipment;

implementing additional safety measures; and
— performing site clean-ups.

As a further result of, notably, the introduction of any new laws and
regulations, the Group could also be compelled to curtail, modify or
cease certain operations or implement temporary shutdowns of
facilities, which could diminish the Group’s productivity and have

a material adverse impact on its results of operations.

All TOTAL entities monitor legal and regulatory developments in order
to remain in compliance with local and international rules and standards
for the assessment and management of industrial and environmental
risks. With regard to the permanent shutdown of an activity, the
Group’s environmental contingencies and asset retirement obligations
are addressed in the “Asset retirement obligations” and “Provisions
for environmental contingencies” sections of the Group’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet (refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, chapter 10, point 7.). Future expenditures related to
asset retirement obligations are accounted for in accordance with
the accounting principles described in Note 1Q to the Consolidated
Financial Statements (chapter 10, point 7.).

Laws and regulations related to climate change and its
physical effects may adversely affect the Group’s business.

Growing public concern in a number of countries over greenhouse
gas emissions and climate change, as well as a multiplication of
stricter regulations in this area, could adversely affect the Group's
businesses and product sales, increase its operating costs and
reduce its profitability.

The regulations concerning the market for CO, emission allowances
in Europe, the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS),
entered a third phase on January 1, 2013. This phase marks the
end of the overall free allocation of emission allowances: certain
emissions, such as those related to electricity production, no longer
benefit from free allowances, while for others, free allowances have
been significantly reduced. Free allocations are now established
based on the emission level of the top-performing plants within the
same sector (“top 10 benchmark”) and lower-performing plants
must purchase, at market price, the necessary allowances to cover
their emissions over and above these free allocations. Moreover, the
Group’s plants will need to indirectly bear the cost of allowances for
all electricity consumed (including electricity generated internally at
its own facilities).

Given these new rules and the European Commission's decision to
apply a “cross-sectoral correction factor” (CSCF) that reduces the
total amount of free allocations for all sectors combined by an
average of 11.6% over phase 3 (2013-2020), the Group estimates
that approximately 30% of its emissions subject to the EU-ETS will
not be covered by free allowances during the 2013-2020 period.

The revision in 2014 to the list of “sectors exposed to carbon leakage”
confirmed that the refining sector in Europe is an exposed sector
and, as such, it may continue to benefit from free allowances.
However, performance for 2013 showed that this sector, which
produces significant amounts of COs, is almost the only sector with
a free allowance deficit exceeding 20%. This deficit resulted mainly
from effects of an ambitious sectoral benchmark and the CSCF,
which is expected to become more severe year by year, thereby
increasing the refining sector's deficit to more than 30% by 2020.

The Group has taken legal actions in relevant local courts having
jurisdiction for its concerned industrial sites to contest national
decisions granting free allowances. In addition, the courts of different
Member States brought the matter before the Court of Justice of
the European Union for a preliminary ruling on the procedures for
determining the free allowances.

The financial risk related to the foreseeable purchase of these
allowances on the market should remain low for the Group if prices
for emission allowances remain close to their current level (€7/t
COz). Nevertheless, due to important regulatory changes that
occurred in phase 3, such as the authorization given to the


--- Page 82 ---

allowance auction calendar (backloading), or due to possible future
regulatory changes, such as the establishment of a “market
reserve”, prices for CO, allowances could increase substantially,
which could cause a significant adverse impact on the results of the
Group's refining operations.

In addition, more of TOTAL’s future production could come from
unconventional sources in order to help meet the world’s growing
demand for energy. Since the energy intensity of oil and gas production

from unconventional sources can be higher than that of production
from conventional sources, the CO emissions produced by the
Group’s activities may increase. Therefore, TOTAL may need to
incur additional costs related to certain projects.

Finally, TOTAL’s businesses operate in varied locales where the
potential physical impacts of climate change, including changes in
weather patterns, are highly uncertain and may adversely impact
the results of the Group’s operations.

2.2. Management and monitoring of industrial and environmental risks

2.2.1. TOTAL’s policies regarding health,
safety and the environment

TOTAL has developed a “Safety Health Environment Quality Charter”
(refer to point 2. of chapter 7) that sets out the basic principles
applicable within the Group regarding the protection of people,
property and the environment. This charter is implemented at several
levels within the Group by means of its management systems.

Along these lines, TOTAL has developed safety, environmental and
quality management systems that it seeks to have certified or assessed
(e.g., standards such as the International Safety Rating System,
ISO 14001 and ISO 9001).

In most countries, TOTAL’s operations are subject to laws and
regulations concerning health, safety and environmental protection
to which TOTAL ensures compliance. The main laws and
regulations include:

1) In Europe: Integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC)
and large combustion plants directives (recast by the Industrial
emissions directive (IED)), Seveso directive, pressure equipment
directive, water framework directive, waste directive, ETS
directive (CO, allowances), Fuel Directive, Registration,
Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)
and Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) regulations.

2) In France: regulations on natural and technological risks.

8) In the United States: Occupational Safety and Health
Administration/Process safety management of highly hazardous
materials (QSHA/PSM), Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liablity Act (also Known as CERCLA or Superfund).

2.2.2. Assessment

As part of its policy, TOTAL performs regular assessments, following
various procedures, of risks and impacts in the areas of industrial
safety (particularly process safety), the environment and the protection
of workers and local residents, including:

— prior to approving new projects, investments, acquisitions
and disposals (refer to chapter 5, point 1.10.);

— periodically during operations (safety studies, environmental
impact assessments, health impact studies and Technological
Risk Prevention Plan - PPRT in France);

— prior to releasing new substances on the market (toxicological
and ecotoxicological studies and life cycle analyses); and

— based on the regulatory requirements of the countries where these
activities are carried out and generally accepted professional practices.

In countries where prior administrative authorization and supervision
is required, projects are not undertaken without the authorization of the
relevant authorities based on the studies provided to the authorities.

In particular, TOTAL has developed a common methodology
for analyzing technological risks that is being gradually applied
to all activities carried out by the companies of the Group
(refer to chapter 7, point 2.2.3.).

2.2.3. Management

TOTAL develops risk management measures based on risk and impact
assessments. These measures involve facility and structure design,
the reinforcement of safety devices and environmental remediation.

In addition to developing management systems as described above,
TOTAL strives to minimize industrial and environmental risks inherent
in its operations by conducting thorough inspections and audits,
training personnel and raising awareness among all those involved.

In addition, performance indicators (particularly in the areas of HSE)
and risk monitoring have been put in place, objectives have been set
and action plans have been implemented to achieve these objectives.

Although the emphasis is on preventing risks, TOTAL takes regular
steps to prepare for crisis management based on identified risk
scenarios.

The Group has a crisis management process that relies on a
permanent on-call system, regular exercises conducted at the
industrial sites of its main entities, a benchmark of the best
practices of international companies and training courses in crisis
management, as well as procedures, emergency booklets and
tools that can be used in the event of a crisis.

The organization set up in the event of a crisis is deployed at two
closely-coordinated levels:

— at the local level (country, site or entities), a crisis unit is responsible
for ensuring operational management and implementations of
emergency plans; and

— at the head office level, a crisis unit consisting of a multi-disciplinary
team is tasked with assessing the situation and overseeing crisis
management. This central unit provides the necessary expertise
and mobilizes additional resources to assist the local crisis unit
when necessary.

In addition, TOTAL has developed emergency plans and procedures
to respond to an oil spill or leak. These plans and procedures are
specific to each TOTAL affiliate and adapted to its organization,
activities and environment and are consistent with the Group’s plan.
They are reviewed regularly and tested through exercises (refer to
point 2.2.3. of chapter 7).


--- Page 83 ---

At the Group level, TOTAL has set up an organization structured
around the Plan to Mobilize Resources Against Pollution (PARAPOL)
alert scheme to facilitate crisis management and provide assistance
without geographical restriction by mobilizing both internal and
external resources in the event of pollution of marine, coastal or
inland waters. The PARAPOL procedure is made available to
entities of the Group and its main goal is to facilitate access to
internal experts and physical response resources.

Furthermore, the Company and its subsidiaries are currently
members of certain oil spill cooperatives that are able to provide
expertise, resources and equipment in all geographic areas where the
Group has operations, including, in particular, Oil Spill Response
Limited and Centre for Documentation, Research and Experimentation
on Accidental Water Pollution (CEDRE).

Following the blow-out on the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico
in 2010 (in which the Group was not involved), TOTAL created three
task forces in order to analyze risks and issue recommendations.

3. Other risks

3.1. Economic environment

The task forces have now finalized their work and the Group
continues to roll out solutions to minimize such risks. Detailed
information on TOTAL initiatives in the fields of safety and
protection of the environment is provided in chapter 7.

TOTAL believes that it is impossible to guarantee that the contingencies
or liabilities related to the above mentioned concerns will not have a
material impact on its business, assets and liabilities, consolidated
financial situation, cash flow or income in the future.

To manage the operational risks to which the Group is exposed,
TOTAL maintains worldwide third-party liability insurance coverage
for all its subsidiaries. TOTAL also maintains insurance to protect
against the risk of damage to Group property and/or business
interruption at its main refining and petrochemical sites. TOTAL’s
insurance and risk management policies are described in

point 5. of this chapter (“Insurance and risk management”).

The operating results and future rate of growth of the Group
are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices.

Prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely due to many
factors over which TOTAL has no control. These factors include:

— variations in global and regional supply and demand of energy;

— global and regional economic and political developments in
resource-producing regions, particularly in the Middle East,
Africa and South America;

— the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and other producing nations to influence global
production levels and prices;

— prices of unconventional energies as well as evolving approaches
for developing oil sands and shale oil, which may affect the
Group’s realized prices, notably under its long-term gas sales
contracts and asset valuations, particularly in North America;

— cost and availability of new technology;

— governmental regulations and actions;

— global economic and financial market conditions;
— war or other conflicts;

— changes in demographics, including population growth rates and
consumer preferences; and

— adverse weather conditions (such as hurricanes) that can disrupt
supplies or interrupt operations of the Group’s facilities.

Substantial or extended declines in oil and natural gas prices would
significantly and adversely affect TOTAL's results of operations by
reducing its profits. The year 2014 was marked by a sharp oil price

detailed information on this oil price decline and its impact on the
Group’s 2014 results, financial position and outlook, refer to chapter 3.
In addition, sensitivity to market environments are described above
and discussed in greater detail in point 1.1. of this chapter.

In addition to the adverse effect on revenues, margins and profitability
from any fall in oil and natural gas prices, a prolonged period of low
prices or other indicators could lead to a review of the Group’s
assets and oil and natural gas reserves. Such review would reflect
the Company's view based on estimates, assumptions and
judgments and could result in a reduction in the Group's reported
reserves and/or a charge for impairment that could have a significant
effect on the Group’s results in the period in which it occurs. Lower
oil and natural gas prices over prolonged periods may also reduce
the economic viability of projects planned or in development, impact
the asset sale program of the Group and reduce liquidity, thereby
decreasing the Group's ability to finance capital expenditures and/or
causing it to cancel or postpone investment projects. If TOTAL is
unable to follow through with investment projects, the Group’s
opportunities for future revenue and profitability growth would be
reduced, which could materially impact the Group's financial condition.

Conversely, in a high oil and gas price environment, the Group can
experience significant increases in cost and government take, and,
under some production-sharing contracts, the Group’s production
rights could be reduced. Higher prices can also reduce demand for
the Group’s products.

The Group’s earnings from its Refining & Chemicals and
Marketing & Services segments are primarily dependent upon the
supply and demand for refined products and the associated
margins on refined product sales, with the impact of changes in oil
and gas prices on earnings on these segments being dependent
upon the speed at which the prices of refined products adjust to


--- Page 84 ---

3.2. Risks related to oil and gas exploration and production

The Group’s long-term profitability depends on cost effective
discovery, acquisition and development of new reserves; if the
Group is unsuccessful, its results of operations and financial
condition would be materially and adversely affected.

A significant portion of the Group’s revenues and the majority

of its operating results are derived from the sale of oil and gas that
the Group extracts from underground reserves developed as part
of its Exploration & Production activities. The development of oil
and gas fields, the construction of facilities and the drilling of
production or injection wells is capital intensive and requires
advanced technology. Due to constantly changing market
conditions and difficult environmental challenges, cost projections
can be uncertain. In order for the Upstream segment to continue
to be profitable, the Group needs to replace its reserves with new
proved reserves. Furthermore, the Group needs to accomplish
such replacement in a manner that allows subsequent production
to be economically viable. However, TOTAL’ ability to discover
or acquire and develop new reserves successfully is uncertain
and can be negatively affected by a number of factors, including:

— the geological nature of oil and gas fields, notably unexpected
drilling conditions including pressure or irregularities in geological
formations;

— the risk of dry holes or failure to find expected commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons;

— the inability of service companies to deliver on contracted
services;

— the inability of the Group’s partners to execute or finance projects
in which the Group holds an interest;

— equipment failures, fires, blow-outs or accidents;

— the Group's inability to develop or implement new technologies
that enable access to previously inaccessible fields;

— the Group's inability to anticipate market changes in a timely
manner;

— adverse weather conditions;

— compliance with both anticipated and unanticipated governmental
requirements, including U.S. and EU regulations that may give a
competitive advantage to companies not subject to such regulations;

— shortages or delays in the availability or delivery of appropriate
equipment;

— industrial action;

— competition from oil and gas companies for the acquisition and
development of assets and licenses (refer to point 3.10. “Risks
related to Competition”);

— increased taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims; and
— disputes related to property titles.

Any of these factors could lead to cost overruns and impair the
Group’s ability to make discoveries and acquisitions or complete

a development project, or to make production economical. It is
impossible to guarantee that new reserves of oil and gas will be
discovered or acquired in sufficient quantities to replace the Group’s
reserves currently being developed, produced and marketed.

Furthermore, some of these factors may also affect the Group’s
projects and facilities further down the oil and gas chain. If TOTAL
fails to develop new reserves cost-effectively on an ongoing basis,
the Group's results of operations, including profits, and the Group’s
financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected.

The Group’s oil and gas reserves data are only estimates and
subsequent downward adjustments are possible. If actual
production from such reserves is lower than current estimates
indicate, the Group’s results of operations and financial
condition would be negatively impacted.

The Group’s proved reserves figures are estimates reflecting applicable
reporting regulations. Proved reserves are those reserves which, by
analysis of geosciences and engineering data, can be estimated
with reasonable certainty to be economically recoverable — from a
given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods and government regulations — prior
to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire,
unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless
of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
estimation. Reserves are estimated by teams of qualified, experienced
and trained geoscientists, petroleum engineers and project engineers,
who rigorously review and analyze in detail all available geosciences
and engineering data (e.g., seismic, electrical logs, cores, fluids,
pressures, flow rates, facilities parameters). This process involves
making subjective judgments, including with respect to the estimate
of hydrocarbons initially in place, initial production rates and recovery
efficiency, based on available geological, technical and economic data.
Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact measurements and
are subject to revision. In addition, they may be negatively impacted
by a variety of factors that are beyond the Group's control and that could
cause such estimates to be adjusted downward in the future, or cause
the Group’s actual production to be lower than its currently reported
proved reserves indicate. The main such factors include:

— adecline in the price of oil or gas, making reserves no longer
economically viable to exploit and therefore not classifiable as
proved;

— an increase in the price of oil or gas, which may reduce the
reserves to which the Group is entitled under production sharing
and risked service contracts and other contractual terms;

— changes in tax rules and other government regulations that make
reserves no longer economically viable to exploit; and

— the actual production performance of the Group’s reservoirs.

The Group’s proved reserves based on SEC rules were 11,523 Mboe
at December 31, 2014, based on the average monthly Brent price

of $101.3/b. If the Brent price were to continue to remain low in 2015
compared to 2014, proved reserves at year-end 2015 could decline.

The Group’s reserves estimates may therefore require substantial
downward revisions to the extent its subjective judgments prove
not to have been conservative enough based on the available
geosciences and engineering data, or the Group’s assumptions
regarding factors or variables that are beyond its control prove to
be incorrect over time. Any downward adjustment would indicate
lower future production amounts, which could adversely affect
the Group’s results of operations, including profits as well as its
financial condition.


--- Page 85 ---

3.3. Major projects and production growth

The Group’s production growth depends on the delivery
of its major development projects.

The Group’s targeted production growth relies heavily on the
successful execution of major development projects that are
increasingly complex and capital-intensive. These major projects
are subject to a number of challenges, including:

— negotiations with partners, governments, suppliers, customers
and others;

— cost overruns and delays related to the availability of skilled labor
or delays in manufacturing and delivery of critical equipment,

3.4. Equity affiliates

or shortages in the availability of such equipment;

— unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup
or cause unscheduled project downtime;

— the actual performance of the reservoir and natural field decline; and

— timely issuance or renewal of permits and licenses by
government agencies.

Poor delivery of any major project that underpins production
or production growth could adversely affect the Group's financial
performance.

Many of the Group’s projects are conducted by equity
affiliates. This may reduce the Group’s degree of control,
as well as its ability to identify and manage risks.

A significant and growing number of the Group’s projects are
conducted by equity affiliates. In cases where the Group’s company
is not the operator, such company may have limited influence over,
and control of, the behavior, performance and costs of the
partnership, its ability to manage risks may be limited and it may,
nevertheless, be prosecuted by regulators or claimants in the event

of an incident. Additionally, the partners of the Group may not

be able to meet their financial or other obligations to the projects,
which may threaten the viability of a given project. These partners
may also not have the financial capacity to fully indemnify the Group
in the event of an incident.

For additional information concerning equity affiliates, refer to Note
12 (“Equity affiliates: investments and loans”) to the Consolidated
Financial Statements (chapter 10, point 7.).

3.5. Risks related to economic or political factors

TOTAL has significant production and reserves located in
politically, economically and socially unstable areas, where the
likelihood of material disruption of the Group’s operations is
relatively high.

A significant portion of TOTAL’s oil and gas production and reserves
is located in countries outside of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). In recent years, a number
of these countries have experienced varying degrees of one or
more of the following: economic instability, political volatility, civil
war, violent conflict, social unrest, actions of terrorist groups and
the application of international economic sanctions. Any of these
conditions alone or in combination could disrupt the Group's
operations in any of these regions, causing substantial declines

in production or revisions to reserves estimates. In Africa, which
represented 31% of the Group’s 2014 combined liquids and gas
production, certain of the countries in which the Group has
production have recently suffered from some of these conditions,
including Nigeria, which has been the main contributing country

to the Group’s production of hydrocarbons since 2012, and Libya.
The Middle East, which represented 18% of the Group’s 2014
combined liquids and gas production, has in recent years suffered
increased political volatility in connection with violent conflict and
social unrest, including Syria, where European Union (EU) and U.S.
economic sanctions have prohibited TOTAL from producing oil and
gas since 2011, and Yemen. In South America, which represented
7% of the Group’s 2014 combined liquids and gas production,

certain of the countries in which TOTAL has production have
recently suffered from some of the above-mentioned conditions,
including Argentina and Venezuela. In Russia, where, as of
December 31, 2014, the Group held 19% of its proved reserves,
members of the international community have, since July 2014,
adopted economic sanctions against certain Russian persons and
entities, including various entities operating in the financial, energy
and defense sectors, in response to the situation in Ukraine (for
additional information, refer to point 3.9.1.3. of this chapter).
Furthermore, in addition to current production, TOTAL is also
exploring for and developing new reserves in other regions of the
world that are historically characterized by political, social and
economic instability, such as the Caspian Sea region where TOTAL
has large projects currently underway. The occurrence and
magnitude of incidents related to economic, social and political
instability are unpredictable. It is possible that they could have a
material adverse impact on the Group’s production and operations
in the future and/or cause certain investors to reduce their holdings
of TOTAL's securities.

TOTAL, like other major international energy companies, has a
geographically diverse portfolio of reserves and operational sites,
which allows it to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to
reduce its exposure to political and economic risks. However, there
can be no assurance that such events will not have a material
adverse impact on the Group.


--- Page 86 ---

TOTAL's activities are subject to intervention by the government
of host countries, which could have an adverse effect on the
Group’s results of operations.

TOTAL has significant exploration and production activities, and in
some cases refining, marketing or chemicals operations, in countries
whose governmental and regulatory framework is subject to
unexpected change and where the enforcement of contractual
rights is uncertain. In addition, the Group's exploration and production
activities in such countries are often done in conjunction with state-
owned entities, for example as part of a joint venture, where the
state has a significant degree of control. In recent years, in various
regions globally, TOTAL has seen governments and state-owned
enterprises imposing more stringent conditions on companies
pursuing exploration and production activities in their respective
countries, increasing the costs and uncertainties of the Group’s
business operations, which is a trend TOTAL expects to continue.

Potential increasing intervention by governments in such countries
can take a wide variety of forms, including:

— the award or denial of exploration and production interests;

— the imposition of specific drilling obligations;

— price and/or production quota controls and export limits;

— nationalization or expropriation of assets;

— unilateral cancellation or modification of license or contract rights;
— increases in taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims;

— the renegotiation of contracts;

— the imposition of increased local content requirements;

— payment delays; and

— currency exchange restrictions or currency devaluation.

Imposition of any of these factors by a host government where TOTAL
has substantial operations, including exploration, could cause the
Group to incur material costs or cause the Group’s production or
value of the Group’s assets to decrease, potentially having a
material adverse effect on its results of operations, including profits.

For example, the Nigerian government has been contemplating new
legislation to govern the petroleum industry which, if passed into law,
could have an impact on the existing and future activities of the Group
in that country through increased taxes and/or costs of operation and
could adversely affect financial returns from projects in that country.

3.6. Ethical misconduct and non compliance risks

Ethical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws by
employees of the Group could expose TOTAL to criminal and
civil penalties and be damaging to TOTAL’s reputation and
shareholder value.

The Group’s Code of Conduct, which applies to all of its employees,
defines the Group’s commitment to business integrity, compliance
with all applicable legal requirements and high ethical standards.
The Code also defines the behavior and actions expected of the
businesses and people of the Group wherever it operates. Ethical
misconduct or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations,
including non-compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption
laws, by TOTAL, its partners, agents or others that act on the
Group’s behalf, could expose TOTAL and its employees to criminal
and civil penalties and could be damaging to TOTAL’s reputation
and shareholder value. In addition, ethical misconduct or

non-compliance with applicable laws may lead the competent
authorities to impose other measures, such as the appointment of an
independent monitor in charge of reviewing the Group’s compliance
and internal control procedures and, if need be, recommending
improvements of such procedures. For an overview of the settlements
between TOTAL, the SEC and the Department of Justice (DoJ)
providing for the appointment of an independent monitor, refer to
point 4. of chapter 4 (Legal and arbitration proceedings — Iran),
point 1.10.2. of chapter 5 (Prevention of corruption risks)

and point 3.7. of chapter 7 (Fair operating practices).

The Group’s General Management has prioritized the deployment
throughout the Group of extensive ethics and compliance policies and
programs since 2009. For more information, refer to point 1.10. of
chapter 5 of this Registration Document.

3.7. Legal aspects of the Group’s activities

3.7.1. Legal aspects of the Upstream
segment’s activities

TOTAL’s Upstream segment conducts activities in various countries
that are subject to a broad range of regulations. These cover
virtually all aspects of exploration and production operations,
including leasehold rights, production rates, royalties, environmental
protection, exports, taxes and foreign exchange rates.

Licenses, permits and contracts governing the Group’s ownership
of oil and gas interests have terms that vary from country to country
and are generally granted by or entered into with a government
entity or a state-owned company and are sometimes entered into
with private owners. These arrangements usually take the form of
concessions or production sharing contracts.

In the framework of oil concession agreements, the oil company
owns the assets and the facilities and is entitled to the entire
production. In exchange, the operating risks, costs and investments
are the oil company’s responsibility and it agrees to remit to the
relevant host country, usually the owner of the subsoil resources, a
production-based royalty, income tax, and possibly other taxes that
may apply under local tax legislation.

The production sharing contract (PSC) involves a more complex
legal framework than the concession agreement: it defines the terms
and conditions of production sharing and sets the rules governing
the cooperation between the company or consortium in possession
of the license and the host country, which is generally represented
by a state-owned company. The latter can thus be involved in
operating decisions, cost accounting and production allocation.


--- Page 87 ---

The consortium agrees to undertake and finance all exploration,
development and production activities at its own risk. In exchange,
it is entitled to a portion of the production, known as “cost oil”, the
sale of which is intended to cover its incurred expenses (capital and
operating costs). The balance of production, known as “profit oil”,
is then shared in varying proportions, between the company or
consortium, on the one hand, and the host country or state-owned
company, on the other hand.

In some instances, concession agreements and PSCs coexist,
sometimes in the same country or even on the same block. Even
though there are other contractual models, TOTAL's license
portfolio is comprised mainly of concession agreements.

On most licenses, the partners and/or the authorities of the host
country, often assisted by international accounting firms, perform
joint venture and PSC cost audits and ensure the observance of
contractual obligations.

In some countries, TOTAL has also signed contracts called “risked
service contracts”, which are similar to PSCs. However, the profit
oil is replaced by a defined cash monetary remuneration, agreed by
contract, which depends notably on field performance parameters
such as the amount of barrels produced.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to
authorization granted by public authorities (licenses), which are
granted for specific and limited periods of time and include an
obligation to relinquish a large portion, or the entire portion in case
of failure, of the area covered by the license at the end of the
exploration period.

TOTAL pays taxes on income generated from its oil and gas
production and sales activities under its concessions, PSCs and
risked service contracts, as provided for by local regulations. In
addition, depending on the country, TOTAL’s production and sales
activities may be subject to a number of other taxes, fees and
withholdings, including special petroleum taxes and fees. The taxes
imposed on oil and gas production and sales activities is generally
substantially higher than those imposed on other industrial or
commercial businesses.

The legal framework of TOTAL's exploration and production
activities, established through concessions, licenses, permits and
contracts granted by or entered into with a government entity, a
state-owned company or, sometimes, private owners, is subject
to certain risks that, in certain cases, can reduce or challenge the
protections offered by this legal framework. In addition to the
uncertainties surrounding enforcement of contractual rights,

new regulations requiring detailed disclosure of payments made
by the Group’s companies to public entities in connection with

its mining operations (including hydrocarbons) may adversely
impact the activities of the Group, its results or its reputation.

3.7.2. Legal aspects of the Group’s
other activities

The activities of the Group’s Refining & Chemicals and
Marketing & Services segments are also subject to a wide range
of regulations.

In European countries and in the United States, sites and products
are subject to regulations concerning the protection of the
environment (water, air, soil, noise, protection of biodiversity, waste
management, impact studies, etc.), health (on-the-job safety,
chemical product risks) and safety (safety of personnel and residents,
maior risk facilities). Product quality and consumer protection are also
subject to regulations. Within the European Union, EU regulations
must be transposed into Member States’ national laws or directly
enforced. In such Member States, EU legislation and regulations
may be in addition to national and local government regulations. In
addition, in all Member States, industrial facilities operate pursuant
to licenses issued by competent local authorities that are based on
national laws and EU regulations. The United States features the
same complex regulatory environment, where local state rules must
be considered in addition to federal rules.

In other countries where the Group operates, legislation is often
modeled after EU and U.S. regulations, with certain regulations being
more fully developed depending on the country (e.g., regulations
pertaining to the protection of water, nature and health). TOTAL has
developed standards inspired by best practices existing in countries
with strong regulations. These standards are being progressively
deployed by the relevant entities of the Group depending on the
context. In addition, depending on the country where the Group
operates, its other activities are subject to specific sector requirements
that impose constraints with respect to, for example, strategic

oil reserves holding requirements and shipping capacities owned
or chartered.

3.7.3. Competition law

Competition laws apply to the Group’s companies in the vast
majority of countries in which it does business. Violations of
competition laws carry fines and expose the Group and its
employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits. Furthermore,

it is now common for persons or corporations allegedly injured
by violations of competition laws to sue for damages.

Some of the Group’s business segments have already been
implementing competition law conformity plans for a long time.
In 2012, a Group policy for compliance with competition law
and prevention of violations in this area was adopted (refer to
point 1.10. of chapter 5). Its implementation is based on a
dedicated organization, the involvement of hierarchies and staff,
and an alert procedure.


--- Page 88 ---

3.8. Critical IT system services and information security

Disruption of TOTAL’s critical IT services or breaches of
information security could adversely affect the Group’s
operations.

The businesses of the Group depend heavily on the reliability and
security of its information technology (“IT”) systems. If the integrity
of the IT systems were compromised due to, for example, technical
failure, or cyber attack, the Group’s business operations and assets
could sustain serious damage, material intellectual property could
be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury, environmental

harm and regulatory violations could occur, potentially having a
material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations,
including profits.

TOTAL's IT department has developed and distributed governance
and security rules that describe the recommended infrastructure,
organization and procedures to maintain information systems that
are appropriate to the organization’s needs and to limit information
security risks. These rules are implemented across the Group under
the responsibility of the various business segments.

3.9. Countries targeted by economic sanctions

TOTAL has activities in certain countries that are targeted by
economic sanctions. If the Group’s activities are not conducted
in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, TOTAL
could be sanctioned or otherwise penalized.

Various members of the international community have targeted
certain countries, including Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria and Russia,
with economic sanctions and other restrictive measures. This section
focuses on certain U.S. and European restrictions relevant to the
Group (refer to point 3.9.1.) and certain disclosure concerning the
Group's limited activities or presence in certain targeted countries
(refer to point 3.9.2.).

3.9.1. U.S. and European legal restrictions

The United States has adopted various laws and regulations
designed to restrict trade with Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, and
the U.S. Department of State has identified these countries as state
sponsors of terrorism. The European Union (“EU”) has similar
restrictions with respect to Iran and Syria. Since mid-2014, both
the United States and the EU have adopted economic sanctions
against various persons and entities in Russia in response to the
situation in Ukraine. A violation by the Group of applicable laws or
regulations could result in criminal and material financial penalties.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(referred to as “OFAC”) administers and enforces economic sanctions
programs against the countries identified as state sponsors of
terrorism, as well as other targeted countries, territories, entities
and individuals, including those engaged in activities related to
terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy
of the United States. The activities that are restricted depend on
the details of each particular sanctions program. Civil and criminal
penalties, which are imposed on a per transaction basis for
apparent violations, can be substantial. These OFAC sanctions
apply to U.S. persons, activities taking place in the United States,
and activities that are otherwise subject to U.S. jurisdiction.

TOTAL continues to closely monitor the possible impacts on all

of its activities of the different economic sanctions regimes. TOTAL
does not believe that its activities in targeted countries are in violation
of applicable international economic sanctions administered by

the United States, the European Union and other members of the
international community. TOTAL cannot assure that current or
future regulations or developments related to economic sanctions
will not have a negative impact on its business or reputation.

Set forth below is additional information concerning U.S.
and EU restrictions adopted against Iran, Syria and Russia.

3.9.1.1. Restrictions against Iran

With respect to Iran, the United States has adopted a number of
measures since 1996 that provide for the possible imposition of
sanctions against non-U.S. companies engaged in certain activities
in and with Iran, including in Iran’s energy sector. The United States
first adopted legislation in 1996 authorizing sanctions against non-
U.S. companies doing business in Iran and Libya (the Iran and
Libya Sanctions Act, referred to as “ILSA”). In 2006, ILSA was
amended to concern only business in Iran (then renamed the Iran
Sanctions Act, referred to as “ISA”). Pursuant to ISA, which has
been amended and expanded since 1996, the President of the
United States is authorized to initiate an investigation into the
activities of non-U.S. companies in lran’s energy sector and to
impose sanctions against persons found, amongst other activities,
to have knowingly made investments of $20 million or more in Iran’s
petroleum sector in any 12-month period. In May 1998, the U.S.
government waived the application of ISA sanctions for TOTAL’s
investment in the South Pars gas field. This waiver, which has

not been modified since it was granted, does not address any of
TOTAL's other activities in Iran. In each of the years between the
passage of ILSA and 2007, TOTAL made investments in Iran in
excess of $20 million (excluding the investments made as part

of the development of South Pars). These investments will not be
sanctioned by the U.S. authorities, provided that TOTAL meets.
certain commitments pursuant to a determination made by U.S.
authorities under a “Special Rule” on September 30, 2010,

as further described below. Since 2008, TOTAL’s position in

Iran essentially has consisted of being reimbursed for its past
investments as part of buyback contracts signed between 1995
and 1999 with respect to permits on which the Group is no longer
the operator. Since 2011, TOTAL has had no production in Iran.

ISA was amended in July 2010 by the Comprehensive Iran
Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010 (“CISADA’),
which expanded both the list of activities with Iran that could lead
to sanctions and the list of restrictive measures available. TOTAL
had already discontinued potentially sanctionable sales of refined
petroleum products to Iran prior to CISADA’s enactment. On
September 30, 2010, the U.S. State Department announced that
the U.S. government, pursuant to the “Special Rule” provision of
ISA added by CISADA that allows it to avoid making a determination
of sanctionability under ISA with respect to any party that provides


--- Page 89 ---

certain assurances, would not make such a determination with
respect to TOTAL. The U.S. State Department further indicated
that, as long as TOTAL acts in accordance with its commitments,
TOTAL will not be regarded as a company of concern for its past
lran-related activities.

Since the applicability of the “Special Rule” to TOTAL was announced
by the U.S. State Department, the United States has imposed a
number of additional measures targeting activities in Iran. TOTAL
does not conduct activities that it believes would be sanctionable
under these measures.

The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012
(“ITRA”) added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (“U.S. Exchange Act”), which requires TOTAL to
disclose whether it or any of its affiliates has engaged during the
calendar year in certain lran-related activities, including those
targeted under ISA, without regard to whether such activities are
sanctionable under ISA, and any transaction or dealing with the
Government of Iran that is not conducted pursuant to a specific
authorization of the U.S. government (refer to point 3.9.2.2., below).
For any annual report that contains responsive Section 13(r)
disclosure, an “Iran Notice” must be separately filed with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC
must notify the President and U.S. Congress, and the President
must initiate an investigation and make a sanctions determination
within 180 days after initiating the investigation. TOTAL believes that
its lran-related activities required to be disclosed by Section 13(r) are
not sanctionable, and TOTAL has not been informed that it is at risk
of possible imposition of sanctions for activities previously disclosed.

Moreover, many U.S. states have adopted legislation with respect
to Iran requiring, in certain conditions, state pension funds to divest
themselves of securities in any company with active business
operations in Iran and state contracts not to be awarded to such
companies. State insurance regulators have adopted similar initiatives
relating to investments by insurance companies in companies doing
business with the Iranian oil and gas, nuclear and defense sectors.
If TOTAL’s presence in Iran were determined to fall within the
prohibited scope of these laws, and TOTAL were not to qualify for
any available exemptions, certain U.S. institutions holding interests
in TOTAL may be required to sell their interests. If significant, sales
of securities resulting from such laws and/or regulatory initiatives
could have an adverse effect on the prices of TOTAL's securities.

The EU has also adopted sanctions measures with regard to Iran,
including a set of restrictive measures adopted in July and
October 2010. Among other things, the supply of key equipment
and technology in the following sectors of the oil and gas industry
in Iran are prohibited: refining, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG),
exploration and production. The prohibition extends to technical
assistance, training and financial assistance in connection with
such items. Extension of loans or credit to, acquisition of shares in,
entry into joint ventures with or other participation in enterprises in
Iran (or Iranian-owned enterprises outside of Iran) engaged in any
of the targeted sectors also is prohibited. Moreover, with respect
to restrictions on transfers of funds and on financial services,

any transfer of at least €400,000 or equivalent to or from an
Iranian individual or entity shall require a prior authorization of

the competent authorities of the EU Member States. TOTAL
conducts its activities in compliance with these EU measures.

On January 23, 2012, the Council of the EU prohibited the
purchase, import and transport of Iranian oil and petroleum and
petrochemical products by European persons and by entities

constituted under the laws of an EU Member State. Prior to that
date, TOTAL had ceased these now-prohibited activities.

TOTAL continues to closely monitor the Joint Plan of Action
announced late 2013 among Iran and the P5+1 countries

(China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States,
as well as Germany) regarding limits on Iran’s nuclear activities and
the suspension of certain United States and EU sanctions regarding
Iran. Negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 were extended in
November 2014 and are ongoing.

3.9.1.2. Restrictions against Syria

With respect to Syria, the EU adopted measures in May 2011

that prohibit the supply of certain equipment to Syria, as well as
certain financial and asset transactions with respect to a list of
named individuals and entities. These measures apply to European
persons and to entities constituted under the laws of an EU Member
State. In September 2011, the EU adopted further measures,
including, notably, a prohibition on the purchase, import or
transportation from Syria of crude oil and petroleum products.
Since early September 2011, the Group ceased to purchase
hydrocarbons from Syria. On December 1, 2011, the EU extended
sanctions against, among others, three state-owned Syrian oil firms,
including General Petroleum Corporation, TOTAL'’s co-contracting
partner in the production sharing agreement signed in 1988

(Deir Ez Zor licence) and the Tabiyeh contract. The United States
also has various measures regarding Syria. Since early

December 2011, the Group has ceased its activities that
contributed to oil and gas production in Syria.

8.9.1.3. Restrictions against Russia

Since July 2014, members of the international community have
adopted economic sanctions against certain Russian persons and
entities, including various entities operating in the financial, energy
and defense sectors, in response to the situation in Ukraine.

Among other things, OFAC has adopted economic sanctions
targeting OAO Novatek, a Russian company listed on the Moscow
Interbank Currency Exchange and the London Stock Exchange in
which the Group held an 18.24% interest as of December 31, 2014
through its subsidiary Total E&P Holdings Russia, and entities in
which OAO Novatek (individually or with other similarly targeted
persons or entities collectively) owns an interest of at least 50%.
The OFAC sanctions applicable to OAO Novatek prohibit U.S.
persons from transacting in, providing financing for or otherwise
dealing in debt issued after July 16, 2014 of greater than 90 days
maturity, including OAO Yamal LNG, which is jointly-owned by
OAO Novatek (60%), Total E&P Yamal (20%) and CNODC (20%),
a subsidiary of CNPC. Consequently, the use of the U.S. dollar

for such financing is effectively prohibited.

In order to comply with these sanctions, the financing plan for

the Yamal LNG project is being reviewed, and the project's partners
are engaged in efforts to develop a financing plan in line with the
applicable regulations.

TOTAL continues to closely monitor the different international
economic sanctions with respect to its activities in Russia.
Within this framework, the Group is filing the requests for prior
authorizations required by EU restrictive measures concerning
technical assistance, brokering services, financing and financial
assistance related to certain technologies. The Treasury
Department of the French Ministry of Finance, the competent


--- Page 90 ---

authority on the subject, issued authorizations specifically for the
projects of Yamal LNG, Kharyaga and Termokarstovoye. The United
States has also imposed export controls and restrictions on the export
of goods, services, and technologies for use in certain Russian
energy projects that may affect TOTAL's activities in Russia.

As of December 31, 2014, the Group held 19 % of its proved
reserves in Russia.

3.9.2. Cuba, Iran and Syria

Provided in this section is certain information concerning TOTAL’s
activities related to Iran in 2014 that is required to be disclosed
pursuant to Section 13(r) of the U.S. Exchange Act. In addition,
information for 2014 is provided concerning the various types

of payments made by Group affiliates to the government of any
country identified by the United States as a state sponsor of
terrorism (currently, Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan) or any entity
controlled by those governments. For more information on certain
U.S. and EU restrictions relevant to TOTAL in these jurisdictions,
see point 3.9.1. above.

3.9.2.1. Cuba

In 2014, Marketing & Services had limited marketing activities for
the sale of specialty products to entities in Cuba and paid taxes
of approximately $256,000 on such activities. Hutchinson,

a Refining & Chemicals affiliate, had limited sales in Cuba of
transmission belts for agricultural machinery via a government-
controlled intermediary that received a commission of
approximately €58,000 (approximately $63,0002). In addition,
Trading & Shipping purchased hydrocarbons pursuant to spot
contracts from a state-controlled entity for approximately

€124 million (approximately $134 million) and paid approximately
€7 million (approximately $8 million) to this entity via put option
transactions with this entity.

8.9.2.2. lran

Section 13(r) of the U.S. Exchange Act requires the Company to
disclose whether it or any of its affiliates engaged during the 2014
calendar year in certain lran-related activities. While neither TOTAL S.A.
nor any of its affiliates have engaged in any activity that would be
required to be disclosed pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C)
of Section 13(r)(1), affiliates of the Company may be deemed to
have engaged in certain transactions or dealings with the government
of Iran that would require disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D),
as discussed below.

Upstream

The Group has no exploration and production activities in Iran and
maintains a local office in Iran solely for non-operational functions.
Some payments are yet to be reimbursed to the Group with respect
to past expenditures and remuneration under buyback contracts
entered into between 1997 and 1999 with the National Iranian Oil
Company (“NIOC”) for the development of the South Pars 2&3 and
Dorood fields. With respect to these contracts, development
operations were completed in 2010 and the Group is no longer
involved in the operation of these fields. In 2014, Total E&P Iran

(1) Since the independance of the Republic of South Sudan on July 9, 2011, TOTAL is no longer present in Sudan.

(100%), Elf Petroleum Iran (99.8%), Total Sirri (100%) and

Total South Pars (99.8%) collectively made payments of
approximately €0.3 million (approximately $0.3 million) to (i)

the Iranian administration for taxes and social security contributions
concerning the personnel of the aforementioned local office and
residual buyback contract-related obligations, and (ii) Iranian public
entities for payments with respect to the maintenance of the
aforementioned local office (e.g., utilities, telecommunications).
TOTAL expects similar payments to be made by these affiliates in
2015. Neither revenues nor profits were recognized from the
aforementioned activities in 2014.

Total E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK”), a wholly-owned affiliate of TOTAL,
holds a 43.25% interest in a joint venture at the Bruce field in the
UK with BP (37.5%, operator), BHP Billiton Petroleum Great Britain
Ltd (16%) and Marubeni Oil & Gas (North Sea) Limited (3.75%).
This joint venture and TEP UK’s Frigg UK Association pipeline
(100%) are parties to agreements (the “Rhum Agreements”)
governing certain transportation, processing and operation
services provided to a joint venture at the Rhum field in the UK that
is co-owned by BP (60%, operator) and the Iranian Oil Company
UK Ltd (“IOC”), a subsidiary of NIOC (60%). To TOTAL’s knowledge,
provision of all services under the Rhum Agreements was initially
suspended in November 2010, when the Rhum field stopped
production following the adoption of EU sanctions, other than
critical safety-related services (i.e. monitoring and marine inspection
of the Rhum facilities), which were permitted by EU sanctions
regulations. On October 22, 2013, the UK government notified |OC
of its decision to apply a temporary management scheme to IOC's
interest in the Rhum field within the meaning of UK Regulations 3
and 5 of the Hydrocarbons (Temporary Management Scheme)
Regulations 2013 (the “Hydrocarbons Regulations”). Since that
date all correspondence in respect of the |OC’s interest in the Rhum
Agreements has been with the UK government in its capacity as
temporary manager of IOC’s interests and TEP UK has had no
contact with IOC in 2014 regarding the Rhum Agreements. On
December 6, 2013, the UK government authorized TEP UK, among
others, under Article 43a of EU Regulation 267/2012, as amended
by 1263/2012 and under Regulation 9 of the Hydrocarbons
Regulations, to carry out activities in relation to the operation and
production of the Rhum field. In addition, on September 4, 2013,
the U.S. Treasury Department issued a license to BP authorizing
BP and certain others to engage in various activities relating to the
operation and production of the Rhum field. Following receipt of all
necessary authorizations, the Rhum field resumed production on
October 26, 2014 with IOC’s interest in the Rhum field and the
Rhum Agreements subject to the UK government's temporary
management pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Regulations. Services
have been provided by TEP UK under the Rhum Agreements since
that date and TEP UK has received tariff income from BP and the
UK government (in its capacity as temporary manager of IOC’s
interest in the Rhum field) in accordance with the terms of the
Rhum Agreements. In 2014, these activities generated for TEP UK
gross revenue of approximately £1.7 million (approximately $2.5 million)
and net profit of approximately £670,000 (approximately $1 million).
TEP UK intends to continue such activities so long as they continue
to be permissible under UK and EU law and not be in breach of
applicable international economic sanctions.

Downstream

The Group does not purchase Iranian hydrocarbons or own or
operate any refineries or chemicals plants in Iran.

Until December 2012, at which time it sold its entire interest, the Group
held a 50% interest in the lubricants retail company Beh Total (now
named Beh Tam) along with Behran Oil (60%), a company controlled
by entities with ties to the government of Iran. As part of the sale of
the Group’s interest in Beh Tam, TOTAL S.A. agreed to license the
trademark “Total” to Beh Tam for an initial 3-year period for the sale
by Beh Tam of lubricants to domestic consumers in Iran.

Total E&P Iran (“TEPI”), a wholly-owned affiliate of TOTAL S.A., received,
on behalf of TOTAL S.A., royalty payments of approximately IRR 24
billion (approximately $86 million) from Beh Tam in 2014 for such
license. These payments were based on Beh Tam’s sales of lubricants
during the previous calendar year. Representatives of the Group
and Beh Tam met several times in 2014 to discuss the local lubricants
market and further discussions are expected to take place in the
future. Similar payments are expected to be received from Beh Tam
in 2015.

Total Marketing Middle East FZE (“TMME”), a wholly-owned affiliate
of the Group, sold lubricants to Beh Tam in 2014. The sale in 2014
of approximately 4,805 t of lubricants generated gross revenue of
approximately AED 47.6 million (approximately $13 million) and a
net profit of approximately AED 9.3 million (approximately

$2.5 million). TMME expects to continue such activity in 2015.

Total Ethiopia Ltd (“TEL”), an Ethiopian company held 99.99% by the
Group and the rest by three Group employees, paid approximately
ETB 154,000 (approximately $7,500) in 2014 to Merific Iran Gas Co,
an Ethiopian company majority-owned by entities affiliated with

the government of Iran, pursuant to a contract for the transport
and storage of LPG in Ethiopia purchased by TEL from international
markets. TEL stopped pursuing this activity in May 2014.

3.10. Risks related to competition

Total Deutschland GmbH (‘Total Deutschland”), a German company
wholly-owned by the Group, provided in 2014 fuel payment cards
to Iranian diplomatic missions in Germany for use in the Group’s
service stations. In 2014, these activities generated gross revenue
of approximately €2,350 (approximately $2,540) and a net profit of
less than €50 (less than $54). Total Deutschland terminated these
arrangements effective April 30, 2014.

Total Marketing Services (“TMS”), a French company wholly-owned
by TOTAL S.A. and six Group employees, provided in 2014 fuel
payment cards to the Iranian embassy in France for use in the Group’s
service stations. In 2014, these activities generated gross revenues
of approximately €30,200 (approximately $32,700) and net income
of approximately €1,100 (approximately $1,200). TMS expects to
continue this activity in 2015.

Caldeo, a French company wholly-owned by TMS, sold in 2014.
domestic heating oil to the Iranian embassy in France, which generated
gross revenues of approximately €6,300 (approximately $6,800)
and net income of approximately €300 (approximately $325).
Caldeo expects to continue this activity in 2015.

8.9.2.3. Syria

Since early December 2011, TOTAL has ceased its activities

that contribute to oil and gas production in Syria and maintains

a local office solely for non-operational functions. In 2014, TOTAL
made payments of approximately €0.35 million (approximately
$0.38 million) to Syrian government agencies in the form of taxes
and contributions for public services rendered in relation to the
maintenance of the aforementioned office and its personnel.

In late 2014, the Group initiated a downsizing of its Damascus
office and reduced its staff to a few employees.

TOTAL’s main competitors are comprised of national oil companies
and international oil companies. The evolution of the energy sector
has opened the door to new competitors, increased market price

volatility and called the viability of long-term contracts into question.

TOTAL is subject to competition in the acquisition of assets and
licenses for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas as
well as for the sale of manufactured products based on crude and
refined oil. In the gas sector, major producers increasingly compete
in the downstream value chain with established distribution
companies, including those that belong to the Group. Increased
competitive pressure could have a significant negative effect on the
prices, margins and market shares of the Group’s companies.

The pursuit of unconventional gas development, particularly in

the United States, has contributed to falling market prices and a
marked difference between spot and long-term contract prices.
The competitiveness of long-term contracts indexed to oil prices
could be affected if this discrepancy persists and if it should prove
difficult to invoke price revision clauses.

The major international oil companies in competition with TOTAL
include ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and BP. As of
December 31, 2014, TOTAL ranked fourth among these companies
in terms of market capitalization”).

4. Legal and arbitration proceedings

There are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, including
any proceeding that the Company is aware of, threatened with or even
pending (including the main legal proceedings described hereafter)
that could have, or could have had during the last twelve months,

4.1. Antitrust investigations

a material impact on the Group’s financial situation or profitability.

The main legal proceedings in which the Group’s companies
are involved are described below.

The principal antitrust proceedings in which the Group’s companies
are involved are described below.

4.1.1. Refining & Chemicals segment

As part of the spin-off of Arkema in 2006, TOTAL S.A. and certain
other Group companies agreed to grant Arkema for a period of ten
years a guarantee for potential monetary consequences related

to antitrust proceedings arising from events prior to the spin-off.
As of December 31, 2018, all public and civil proceedings covered
by the guarantee were definitively resolved in Europe and in the
United States. Despite the fact that Arkema has implemented
since 2001 compliance procedures that are designed to prevent
its employees from violating antitrust provisions, it is not possible
to exclude the possibility that the relevant authorities could
commence additional proceedings involving Arkema regarding
events prior to the spin-off.

4.1.2. Marketing & Services segment

— Following the appeal lodged by the Group’s companies against
the European Commission’s 2008 decision fining Total
Marketing Services an amount of €128.2 million in relation to
practices regarding a product line of the Marketing & Services
segment, which the company had already paid, and concerning

4.2. Grande Paroisse

which TOTAL S.A. was declared jointly liable as the parent
company, the relevant European court decided during the
third quarter of 2013 to reduce the fine imposed on Total
Marketing Services to €125.5 million without modifying

the liability of TOTAL S.A. as parent company. Appeals have
been lodged against this judgment.

— Inthe Netherlands, a civil proceeding was initiated against
TOTAL S.A., Total Marketing Services and other companies by
third parties alleging damages in connection with practices
already sanctioned by the European Commission. At this stage,
the plaintiffs have still not communicated the amount of their claim.

— Finally, in Italy, in 2018, a civil proceeding was initiated against
TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiary Total Aviazione Italia Srl before the
competent Italian civil court. The plaintiff claims against TOTAL S.A.,
its subsidiary and other third parties, damages that it estimates
to be nearly €908 million. This proceeding follows practices that
had been sanctioned by the Italian competition authority in 2006.
The proceeding has not progressed; the existence and the
assessment of the alleged damages in this proceeding involving
multiple defendants remain strongly contested.

Whatever the evolution of the proceedings described above, the Group
believes that their outcome should not have a material adverse
effect on the Group's financial situation or consolidated results.

An explosion occurred at the Grande Paroisse industrial site in the
city of Toulouse in France on September 21, 2001. Grande Paroisse,
a former subsidiary of Atofina which became a subsidiary of

Elf Aquitaine Fertilisants on December 31, 2004, as part of the
reorganization of the Chemicals segment, was principally engaged
in the production and sale of agricultural fertilizers. The explosion,
which involved a stockpile of ammonium nitrate pellets, destroyed a
portion of the site and caused the death of thirty-one people, including
twenty-one workers at the site, and injured many others. The explosion
also caused significant damage to certain property in part of the
city of Toulouse.

This plant has been closed and individual assistance packages
have been provided for employees. The site has been rehabilitated.

On December 14, 2006, Grande Paroisse signed, under the
supervision of the city of Toulouse, a deed whereby it donated the
former site of the AZF plant to the greater agglomeration of Toulouse
(CAGT) and the Caisse des dépdts et consignations and its subsidiary
ICADE. Under this deed, TOTAL S.A. guaranteed the site remediation

Obligations of Grande Paroisse and granted a €10 million endowment
to the InNaBioSanté research foundation as part of the setting up of a
cancer research center at the site by the city of Toulouse.

After having articulated several hypotheses, the Court-appointed
experts did not maintain in their final report filed on May 11, 2006,
that the accident was caused by pouring a large quantity of a
chlorine compound over ammonium nitrate. Instead, the experts
have retained a scenario where a container of chlorine compound
sweepings was poured between a layer of wet ammonium nitrate
covering the floor and a quantity of dry agricultural nitrate at a location
not far from the principal storage site. This is claimed to have
caused an explosion which then spread into the main storage site.
Grande Paroisse was investigated based on this new hypothesis
in 2006; Grande Paroisse is contesting this explanation, which it
believes to be based on elements that are not factually accurate.

On July 9, 2007, the investigating magistrate brought charges against
Grande Paroisse and the former Plant Manager before the Toulouse
Criminal Court. In late 2008, TOTAL S.A. and Mr. Thierry Desmarest,

(1) Arkema is used in this section to designate those companies of the Arkema group whose ultimate parent company is Arkema S.A. Arkema became an independent company after being


--- Page 93 ---

Chairman and CEO at the time of the event, were summoned to
appear in Court pursuant to a request by a victims association.

On November 19, 2009, the Toulouse Criminal Court acquitted
both the former Plant Manager, and Grande Paroisse due to the
lack of reliable evidence for the explosion. The Court also ruled that
the summonses against TOTAL S.A. and Mr. Thierry Desmarest
were inadmissible.

Due to the presumption of civil liability that applied to Grande
Paroisse, the Court declared Grande Paroisse civilly liable for the
damages caused by the explosion to the victims in its capacity
as custodian and operator of the plant.

The Prosecutor's office, together with certain third parties, appealed
the Toulouse Criminal Court verdict. In order to preserve its rights,
Grande Paroisse lodged a cross-appeal with respect to civil charges.

By its decision of September 24, 2012, the Court of Appeal of
Toulouse (Cour d’appel de Toulouse) upheld the lower court verdict
pursuant to which the summonses against TOTAL S.A. and

Mr. Thierry Desmarest were determined to be inadmissible.

This element of the decision has been appealed by certain third
parties before the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation).

The Court of Appeal considered, however, that the explosion was the
result of the chemical accident described by the court-appointed
experts. Accordingly, it convicted the former Plant Manager and
Grande Paroisse. This element of the decision has been appealed
by the former Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse before the French
Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has the effect of
suspending their criminal sentences. On January 13, 2015, the French
Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) fully quashed the decision of
September 24, 2012. The impugned decision is set aside and the
parties find themselves in the position they were in before the decision
was rendered. The case is referred back to the Court of Appeal of
Paris for a new criminal trial. The trial date has not yet been set.

A ccompensation mechanism for victims was set up immediately
following the explosion. €2.3 billion was paid for the compensation
of claims and related expenses amounts. A €10.3 million reserve
remains booked in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements
as of December 31, 2014.

4.3. Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee — Russian regions and Interneft

Blue Rapid, a Panamanian company, and the Russian Olympic
Committee filed a claim for damages with the Paris Commercial
Court against Elf Aquitaine, alleging a so-called non-completion

by a former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine of a contract related to an
exploration and production project in Russia negotiated in the early
1990s. Elf Aquitaine believed this claim to be unfounded and
opposed it. On January 12, 2009, the Commercial Court of Paris
rejected Blue Rapid’s claim against Elf Aquitaine and found that the
Russian Olympic Committee did not have standing in the matter.
Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee appealed this
decision. On June 30, 2011, the Court of Appeal of Paris dismissed
as inadmissible the claim of Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic
Committee against Elf Aquitaine, notably on the grounds of the
contract having lapsed. Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic
Committee appealed this decision to the French Supreme Court.

4.4. lran

In connection with the same facts, and fifteen years after the
termination of the exploration and production contract, a Russian
company, which was held not to be the contracting party to the
contract, and two regions of the Russian Federation that were not
even parties to the contract, launched an arbitration procedure
against the aforementioned former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine that
was liquidated in 2005, claiming alleged damages of $22.4 billion.
For the same reasons as those successfully adjudicated by Elf
Aquitaine against Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee,
the Group considers this claim to be unfounded as a matter of law
and fact. The Group has lodged a criminal complaint to denounce
the fraudulent claim of which the Group believes it is a victim and
has taken and reserved its rights to take other actions and
measures to defend its interests.

In 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
followed by the Department of Justice (DoJ) issued a formal order
directing an investigation in connection with the pursuit of business
in Iran by certain oil companies including, among others, TOTAL.

The inquiry concerned an agreement concluded by the Company
with consultants concerning gas fields in Iran and aimed at verifying
whether certain payments made under this agreement would have
benefited Iranian officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) and the Company's accounting obligations.

In late May 2013, and after several years of discussions, TOTAL reached
settlements with the U.S. authorities (a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
with the DoJ and a Cease and Desist Order with the SEC). These
settlements, which put an end to these investigations, were concluded
without admission of guilt and in exchange for TOTAL respecting a
number of obligations, including the payment of a fine ($245.2 million)
and civil compensation ($153 million) that occurred during the second
quarter of 2013. The reserve of $398.2 million that was booked in the

financial statements as of June 30, 2012, has been fully released. By
virtue of these settlements, TOTAL also accepted the appointment
of a French independent compliance monitor to review the Group’s
compliance program and to recommend possible improvements.
For more information, refer to point 1.10.2. of chapter 5 (Prevention
of corruption risks) and point 3.7. (Fair operating pratices).

With respect to the same facts, TOTAL and its late Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, who was President of the Middle East division
at the time of the facts, were placed under formal investigation in
France following a judicial inquiry initiated in 2006. In late May 2013,
the Prosecutor's office recommended that the case be sent to trial.
This position was reiterated by the Prosecutor's office in June 2014.
By order notified in October 2014, the investigating magistrate
decided to refer the case to trial.

At this point, the Company considers that the resolution of these
cases is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s
financial situation or consequences for its future planned operations.

4.5. Oil-for-Food Program

Several countries have launched investigations concerning
possible violations related to the United Nations (UN) Oil-for-Food
Program in Iraq.

Pursuant to a French criminal investigation, certain current or
former Group employees were placed under formal criminal
investigation for possible charges as accessories to the
misappropriation of corporate assets and as accessories to

the corruption of foreign public agents. In 2007, the criminal
investigation was closed and the case was transferred to the
Prosecutor's office. In 2009, the Prosecutor's office recommended
to the investigating magistrate that the case against the Group's
current and former employees and TOTAL’s late Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, formerly President of the Group’s
Exploration & Production division, not be pursued.

In early 2010, despite the recommendation of the Prosecutor's
Office, a new investigating magistrate, having taken over the case,
decided to indict TOTAL S.A. on bribery charges as well as
complicity and influence peddling. The indictment was brought

4.6. Italy

eight years after the beginning of the investigation without any
new evidence being introduced.

In October 2010, the Prosecutor's office recommended to the
investigating magistrate that the case against TOTAL S.A., the
Group’s former employees and TOTALs late Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer not be pursued. However, by ordinance notified in
early August 2011, the investigating magistrate on the matter
decided to send the case to trial. On July 8, 2013, TOTAL S.A.,
the Group's former employees and TOTAL’s late Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer were cleared of all charges by the Criminal
Court, which found that none of the offenses for which they

had been prosecuted were established. On July 18, 2013, the
Prosecutor's office appealed the parts of the Criminal Court’s
decision acquitting TOTAL S.A. and certain of the Group’s former
employees. TOTAL’s late Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s
acquittal issued on July 8, 2013 was irrevocable since the
Prosecutor's office did not appeal this part of the Criminal Court’s
decision. The appeal hearing is expected to start in October 2015.

As part of an investigation led by the Prosecutor of the Republic of
the Potenza Court, Total Italia and certain Group employees were
the subjects of an investigation related to certain calls for tenders that
Total Italia made for the preparation and development of an oil field.

The criminal investigation was closed in the first half of 2010.

4.7. Rivunion

In May 2012, the Judge of the preliminary hearing decided to dismiss
the charges against some of the Group’s employees and to refer
the case for trial for a reduced number of charges. The trial started
in September 2012.

On July 9, 2012, the Swiss Tribunal Fédéral (Switzerland’s Supreme
Court) rendered a decision against Rivunion, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, confirming a tax reassessment in the
amount of CHF 171 million (excluding interest for late payment).
According to the Tribunal, Rivunion was held liable as tax collector
for withholding taxes owed by the beneficiaries of taxable services.
Rivunion, in liquidation since March 13, 2002 and unable to recover
the amounts corresponding to the withholding taxes in order

4.8. Total Gabon

to meet its fiscal obligations, has been subject to insolvency
proceedings since November 1, 2012. On August 29, 2013,

the Swiss federal tax administration lodged a claim as part

of the insolvency proceedings of Rivunion, for an amount of

CHF 284 million, including CHF 171 million of principal as well as
interest for late payment. Rivunion’s insolvency proceedings was
terminated on December 4, 2014 and the company was removed
from the Geneva commercial register on December 11, 2014.

On February 14, 2014, Total Gabon received a tax re-assessment
notice from the Ministére de I’Economie et de la Prospective of the
Gabonese Republic accompanied by a partial tax collection notice,
following the tax audit of Total Gabon in relation to the years 2008
to 2010. The partial tax collection procedure was suspended on
March 5, 2014 further to the action that Total Gabon engaged
before the Tax Administration.

Discussions with the Gabonese authorities led to the termination
in early November 2014 of the tax assessment procedure to
which Total Gabon was subject. Net income for Total Gabon as
of September 30, 2014 includes the impact of the closing of this
procedure, following which Total Gabon obtained a tax clearance
for the relevant period, extended to and including the years 2011
to 2013.

4.9. Kashagan

In Kazakhstan, the start-up of production of the Kashagan field,

in which TOTAL holds an interest of 16.81%, occurred on
September 11, 2013. Following the detection of a gas leak from
the export pipeline, production was stopped on September 24, 2013.
Production was resumed but then stopped again shortly thereafter
following the detection of another leak. Pressure tests were performed
in a fully controlled environment revealing some other potential
leaks/cracks. The production of the field was stopped and a
thorough investigation was launched.

After the identification of a significant number of anomalies in the
oil and gas export lines, it was decided to replace both pipelines.

4.10. Djibouti

The remedial work will be conducted according to best international
oil and gas field practices and strict HSE requirements in order

to address, mitigate and remedy all problems prior to the restart

of production.

On December 13, 2014, the Republic of Kazakhstan and the co-
venturers of the consortium settled the disputes raised over the last
several years concerning a number of operational, financial and
environmental matters. This settlement agreement definitively
closed these proceedings without a significant impact on the
Group’s financial situation or consolidated results.

Following the confirmation of their conviction by a final judgment of
the facts regarding pollution that occurred in the port of Djibouti in
1997, Total Djibouti S.A. and Total Marketing Djibouti S.A. each
received in September 2014 an order to pay €53.8 million to the
Republic of Djibouti. The amounts were contested by the two
companies which, unable to deal with the liability, in accordance
with local law, filed declarations of insolvency with the court on
October 7, 2014. With respect to Total Djibouti S.A., the insolvency
proceeding comprised a recovery plan.

Following a judgment delivered on November 18, 2014, the
recovery plan proposed by Total Djibouti S.A. was rejected and
the two companies were put into liquidation.

Total Djibouti S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TOTAL S.A.,
fully holds the capital of Total Marketing Djibouti S.A.

5. Insurance and risk management

5.1. Organization

TOTAL has its own reinsurance company, Omnium Reinsurance
Company (ORC). ORC is integrated within the Group’s insurance
management and is used as a centralized global operations tool
for covering the Group companies’ insurable risks. It allows the
Group’s worldwide insurance program to be implemented in
compliance with the specific requirements of local regulations
applicable in the countries where the Group operates.

Some countries may require the purchase of insurance from a
local insurance company. If the local insurer accepts to cover the
subsidiary of the Group in compliance with its worldwide insurance
program, ORC negotiates a retrocession of the covered risks from
the local insurer. As a result, ORC enters into reinsurance contracts
with the subsidiaries’ local insurance companies, which transfer
most of the risk to ORC.

At the same time, ORC negotiates a reinsurance program at the
Group level with oil industry mutual insurance companies and
commercial reinsurance markets. ORC allows the Group to better
manage price variations in the insurance market by taking on a
greater or lesser amount of risk corresponding to the price trends
in the insurance market.

In 2014, the net amount of risk retained by ORC after reinsurance
was a maximum of $53 million per onshore third-party liability
insurance claim, or $77 million per offshore third-party liability
insurance claim on the one hand and $75 million per property
damage and/or business interruption insurance claim, on the
other hand. Accordingly, in the event of any loss giving rise to

an aggregate insurance claim, the effect on ORC would be limited
to its maximum retention of $152 million per occurrence.


--- Page 96 ---

5.2. Risk and insurance management policy

In this context, the Group risk and insurance management policy is
to work with the relevant internal department of each subsidiary to:

— define scenarios of major disaster risks (estimated maximum loss);

— assess the potential financial impact on the Group should a
catastrophic event occur;

5.3. Insurance policy

— help to implement measures to limit the probability that a
catastrophic event occurs and the financial consequences if such
event should occur; and

— manage the level of financial risk from such events to be either
covered internally by the Group or transferred to the insurance
market.

The Group has worldwide property insurance and third-party liability
coverage for all its subsidiaries. These programs are contracted with
first-class insurers (or reinsurers and oil and gas industry mutual
insurance companies through ORC).

The amounts insured depend on the financial risks defined in the
disaster scenarios and the coverage terms offered by the market
(available capacities and price conditions).

More specifically for:

— Third-party liability: since the maximum financial risk cannot be
evaluated by a systematic approach, the amounts insured are
based on market conditions and oil and gas industry practice.
In 2014, the Group’s third-party liability insurance for any liability
(including potential accidental environmental liabilities) was
capped at $900 million (onshore) and $800 million (offshore).

— Property damage and business interruption: the amounts insured
vary by sector and by site and are based on the estimated cost
and scenarios of reconstruction under maximum loss situations
and on insurance market conditions. The Group subscribed for
business interruption coverage in 2014 for its main refining and
petrochemical sites.

For example, for the Group’s highest risks (North Sea platforms
and main refineries and petrochemical plants), in 2014 the
insurance limit for the Group share of the installations was
approximately $1.7 billion for the Refining & Chemicals segment
and approximately $2 billion for the Upstream segment.

Deductibles for property damage and third-party liability fluctuate
between €0.1 and €10 million depending on the level of risk and
liability, and are borne by the relevant subsidiaries. For business
interruption, coverage is triggered sixty days after the occurrence
giving rise to the interruption. In addition, the main refineries and
petrochemical plants bear a combined retention for property damage
and business interruption of $50 million per insurance claim.

Other insurance contracts are bought by the Group in addition to
property damage and third-party liability coverage, mainly in connection
with car fleets, credit insurance and employee benefits. These risks
are mostly underwritten by outside insurance companies.

The above-described policy is given as an example of a situation
as of a given date and cannot be considered as representative of
future conditions. The Group’s insurance policy may be changed
at any time depending on the market conditions, specific
circumstances and on the General Management's assessment
of the risks incurred and the adequacy of their coverage.

TOTAL believes that its insurance coverage is in line with industry
practice and sufficient to cover normal risks in its operations.
However, the Group is not insured against all potential risks. In the
event of a major environmental disaster, for example, TOTAL’s
liability may exceed the maximum coverage provided by its third-
party liability insurance. The loss TOTAL could suffer in the event

of such disaster would depend on all the facts and circumstances
of the event and would be subject to a whole range of uncertainties,
including legal uncertainty as to the scope of liability for consequential
damages, which may include economic damage not directly
connected to the disaster. The Group cannot guarantee that it

will not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no guarantee,
particularly in the case of a major environmental disaster or
industrial accident, that such loss would not have a material
adverse effect on the Group.
