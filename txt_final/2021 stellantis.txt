MANAGEMENT REPORT
FCA-PSA Merger

On December 17, 2019, FCA and PSA entered into a combination agreement providing for the combination of FCA
and PSA through a cross-border merger, with FCA as the surviving legal entity in the merger (“Stellantis N.V.”).

On September 14, 2020, FCA and PSA agreed to amend the combination agreement. According to the combination
agreement amendment, the FCA Extraordinary Dividend, to be paid to former FCA shareholders was reduced to €2.9 billion,
with PSA’s 46 percent stake in Faurecia S.E. (“Faurecia’”’) planned to be distributed to all Stellantis shareholders promptly
after closing following approval of the Stellantis board and shareholders.

On January 4, 2021, PSA and FCA held their respective extraordinary general shareholder meetings in order to,
among other matters, approve the merger transaction. The respective shareholder meetings approved the merger. Following
the respective shareholder approvals and receipt of the final regulatory clearances, FCA and PSA completed the legal merger.

The conditions agreed to as part of the regulatory clearance did not have a material impact on the cash flows or
financial positions for the Company.

On January 17, 2021, the board of directors was appointed, the Stellantis articles of association became effective and
the combined company was renamed Stellantis. On this date, the Stellantis management and board of directors collectively
obtained the power and the ability to control the assets, liabilities and operations of both FCA and PSA. As such, under IFRS
3 - Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”), January 17, 2021 is the acquisition date for the business combination.

On January 29, 2021, the approximately €2.9 billion extraordinary distribution was paid to holders of FCA common
shares of record as of the close of business on Friday, January 15, 2021. Refer to Note 3, Scope of Consolidation, within the
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

Identification of the accounting acquirer

The merger was accounted for by Stellantis using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3,
which requires the identification of the acquirer and the acquiree for accounting purposes. Based on the assessment of the
indicators under IFRS 3 and consideration of all pertinent facts and circumstances, management determined that PSA is the
acquirer for accounting purposes and as such, the merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition. In identifying PSA
as the acquiring entity, notwithstanding that the merger was effected through an issuance of FCA shares, the most significant
indicators were (i) the composition of the combined group’s board, composed of eleven directors, six of whom were to be
nominated by PSA, PSA shareholders or PSA employees, or were current PSA executives, (ii) the combined group’s first
CEO, who is vested with the full authority to individually represent the combined group, and was the president of the PSA
Managing Board prior to the merger, and (iii) the payment of a premium by pre-merger shareholders of PSA. Refer to Note 3,
Scope of Consolidation, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional
information.

Faurecia Distribution

On January 25, 2021, an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders was convened in order to approve the
distribution by Stellantis to the holders of its common shares of up to 54,297,006 ordinary shares of Faurecia (an automotive
equipment supplier) and up to €308 million, which are the proceeds received by Peugeot S.A. in November 2020 from the
sale of certain ordinary shares of Faurecia. The distribution represented the legacy PSA ownership in Faurecia and
approximately 39 percent of the share capital of Faurecia and became unconditional on March 10, 2021, with (i) ex-date on
Monday, March 15, 2021; and (ii) record date on Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Holders of Stellantis common shares have been
entitled to: (i) 0.017029 ordinary shares of Faurecia; and (ii) €0.096677 for each common share of Stellantis they hold on the
record date for the Distribution. The distribution occurred on March 22, 2021, resulting in 53,130,574 ordinary shares of
Faurecia and €302 million in cash distributed. The Company lost control of Faurecia on January 11, 2021. Refer to Note 3,
Scope of consolidation, and to Note 27, Equity, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report for additional information on Faurecia deconsolidation and distribution.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

This Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared to give effect to completion of the
merger of PSA and FCA to create Stellantis, which was completed on January 17, 2021, as if it had been completed on
January 1, 2020. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information includes the unaudited pro forma
consolidated income statement for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the related explanatory notes (the
“Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information”). The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only with the aim to provide comparative period income statement information,
and does not necessarily represent what the actual results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on
January 1, 2020. Additionally, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not attempt to represent, or
be an indication of, the future results of operations or cash flows of Stellantis. No pro forma statement of financial position
has been presented as the effects of the merger have been reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position of
Stellantis as of December 31, 2021. Please refer to the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2021
included elsewhere within this report for additional information.

Refer to the section FCA - PSA merger included above for information on the reverse acquisition presentation of the
financial statements and to Note 3, Scope of Consolidation in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere
within this report for additional information on the merger.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information presented herein is derived from (i) the Consolidated
Income Statement of Stellantis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included elsewhere in this report, (ii) FCA’s
Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2020, contained in FCA’s Annual Report on Form 20-F
filed with the SEC on March 4, 2020, (iii) the consolidated statement of income included in the audited consolidated financial

The consolidated financial statements of Stellantis, PSA and FCA are prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. There is no effect on the consolidated financial statements
resulting from differences between IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The Unaudited
Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is prepared on a basis that is consistent with the accounting policies used in
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Stellantis as of and for year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
included elsewhere in this report.

Consolidated Financial Information to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are directly attributable to the merger
and factually supportable. Specifically, the pro forma adjustments relate to the following:

* The purchase price allocation, primarily to reflect adjustments to depreciation and amortization associated with
the acquired property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with a finite useful life, as well as a reduction
in the interest expense related to the fair value adjustment to financial liabilities.

+ The alignment of accounting policies of FCA to those applied by Stellantis.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Note 1 — Stellantis / PSA Historical Consolidated (as adjusted)

This column represents the Consolidated Income Statement of Stellantis for the year ended December 31, 2021 and
the PSA Historical Consolidated Income Statement (as adjusted) for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is derived
from the historical consolidated statement of income of PSA for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In accordance with IFRS 3, PSA was determined to be the acquirer for accounting purposes, therefore, the year
ended December 31, 2020 represents the continuing operations of PSA adjusted for the discontinuation of Faurecia. Refer to
Note 3, Scope of Consolidation, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere within this report for
additional information.

Note 2 — FCA Historical

This column represents FCA’s results for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 16, 2021, as derived from
FCA’s accounting records as well as the FCA consolidated income statement included in FCA’s audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. In order to conform to the presentation of Stellantis in its
Consolidated Income Statement for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included elsewhere within this report,
Results from investments related to equity method investments are reclassified to Share of the profit of equity method
investees, and Results from Investments other than equity method investments are reclassified to Net financial expenses.

Note 3 — Purchase Price Allocation

As noted in the introduction to this Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, the merger has been
accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3, with PSA identified as the accounting
acquirer (reverse acquisition accounting). The acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3 applies the fair value concepts
defined in IFRS 13 and requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business
combination be recognized by the acquirer at their fair values as of the merger date, which for accounting purposes was
January 17, 2021. As a result, the acquisition method of accounting has been applied and the assets and liabilities of FCA
have been recognized at the merger acquisition date at their respective fair values, with limited exceptions as permitted by
IFRS 3. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of FCA’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed has
been recorded as goodwill. Refer to Note 3, Scope of Consolidation, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere within this report for additional information.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information reflects the effects of the purchase accounting
adjustments, where applicable, on the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the years ended December 31,

2021 and 2020 as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2020.

The following tables provide a summary of the pro forma effects of the purchase price allocation adjustments in the
unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The pro forma adjustments are described in further detail below.

A. Intangible assets

The fair value of brands (Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Fiat, Maserati, Alfa Romeo and Mopar) was determined through an
income approach based on the relief from royalty method, which requires an estimate of future expected cash flows. The
useful life associated with the brands is determined to be indefinite. For capitalized development expenditures, the fair value
has been assessed according to a multi-criteria approach based on relief from royalty method and an excess-earning method.
The fair value for the Dealer network has been assessed using the replacement cost method. The fair value of reacquired
rights has been valued based on the discounted cash flows expected from the related agreement.

Amortization of intangible assets has been calculated on the fair value taking into account the estimated remaining
useful life of the acquired assets. The related change in amortization as a result of the fair value adjustment to intangible
assets was a net decrease in amortization expense of €40 million and €964 million for the period January | to January 16,
2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, of which €40 million and €960 million has been recorded
within Research and development costs in relation to capitalized research and development costs and other intangible assets,
respectively, and €8 million has been recorded within Selling, general and other costs in relation to the dealer network and (4)
million has been recorded within Cost of revenues in relation to reacquired rights for the year ended December 31, 2020.

15


--- Page 7 ---

B. Property, plant and equipment

The fair value of property, plant and equipment was determined primarily through the replacement cost method,
which requires an estimation of the physical, functional and economic obsolescence of the related assets. A market approach,
which requires the comparison of the subject assets to transactions involving comparable assets, was applied to determine the
fair value of land. The fair value of certain assets was determined through an income approach.

Depreciation has been calculated on the fair value taking into account the estimated remaining useful life of the
acquired assets. The related change in depreciation as a result of the fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment
was a decrease in depreciation expense of €47 million and €1,136 million for the period January | to January 16, 2021 and
for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, of which €45 million and €1,092 million has been recorded within Cost
of revenues and €2 million and €44 million has been recorded within Selling, general and other costs in the Unaudited Pro
Forma Consolidated Financial Information.

C. Financial liabilities

Purchase price adjustments were recognized to step up to fair value the financial liabilities based on quoted market
prices for listed debt and based on discounted cash flow models for debt that is not listed. The fair value adjustments to
financial liabilities resulted in a decrease in interest expense due to the decrease of the effective interest rate based on current
market conditions, of €21 million and €462 million for the period January | to January 16, 2021 and for the year ended
December 31, 2020, respectively, and has been recorded within Net financial income (expense) in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Financial Information.

D. Other

Primarily reflects:

* — the recognition of additional revenue of €2 million and €54 million for the period January 1 to January 16, 2021
and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, as a result of a step up to fair value of deferred revenue
relating to extended warranty service contracts, as well as additional finance costs of €4 million and €93 million
for the period January | to January 16, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, due to the
recognition of the fair value adjustments of the related liabilities.

«the reversal of the impact on cost of revenues of €7 million and €232 million for the period January | to January
16, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, of certain prepaid assets that were written off

as part of the purchase price allocation.

The step up in the value of inventories has not been recognized as a pro forma adjustment as this impact has been
recognized in Stellantis results for the year ended December 31, 2021.

E. Tax expense

Represents the tax effects on the pro forma adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated income
statement, calculated based on statutory tax rates applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

16


--- Page 8 ---

Note 4 — Other Adjustments
Other adjustments mainly include the following:

* the elimination of the intercompany transactions with Sevel in the Stellantis Consolidated Income Statement for
the year ended December 31, 2020 of €534 million. Sevel is a joint operation that was previously owned 50
percent each by both PSA and FCA. Upon completion of the merger, Stellantis holds 100 percent of Sevel,
which is fully consolidated from that date;

* the alignment of FCA’s accounting policies to Stellantis accounting policies resulting in a net decrease in Net
profit of €100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily relating to an increase in Research and
development expenditures expensed;

* the alignment of the classification of certain items to align to Stellantis’ income statement presentation.

History of Stellantis

Stellantis N.V. (“Stellantis”) was incorporated as a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) under
the laws of the Netherlands on April 1, 2014 under the name Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V (“FCA”).

In its current configuration, Stellantis is the result of the merger of FCA and PSA, each of which were leading
independent global automotive groups prior to the merger.

Fiat S.p.A., the predecessor to FCA, was founded as Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino on July 11, 1899 in Turin,
Italy as an automobile manufacturer. Fiat grew in Italy and internationally in the following decades both organically and
through the acquisition of several prominent brands and manufacturers including Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Ferrari.
In 2009, FCA US LLC, then known as Chrysler Group LLC (“FCA US”), acquired the principal operating assets of the
former Chrysler LLC as part of a government-sponsored restructuring of the North American automotive industry. Between
2009 and 2014, Fiat S.p.A. expanded its initial 20 percent ownership interest to 100 percent of the ownership of FCA US and
on October 12, 2014, Fiat S.p.A. completed a corporate reorganization resulting in the establishment of FCA as the parent
company of the FCA Group, with its principal executive offices in the United Kingdom. In January 2011, the separation of
Fiat S.p.A.’s non-automotive capital goods business was completed with the creation of Fiat Industrial, now known as CNH
Industrial N.V. In October 2015, the initial public offering of Ferrari N.V. was completed, followed by the spin-off of FCA’s
remaining interest in Ferrari to its shareholders in January 2016.

Peugeot S.A. began manufacturing and selling vehicles to consumers in 1896 and also expanded its automotive
business, particularly in the second half of the twentieth century. In 1974, PSA acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Citroén S.A. and then merged the two companies in 1976. In 1978, PSA acquired Chrysler Corporation’s stake in its
industrial and commercial subsidiaries in Europe, as well as Chrysler Financial Corporation’s European commercial
financing subsidiaries. In 1995, PSA Finance Holding, which provided financing for Peugeot and Citroén vehicle sales, was
transformed into a bank and subsequently renamed “Banque PSA Finance”. PSA acquired the Opel and Vauxhall subsidiaries
of General Motors (“GM”) on August 1, 2017. As contemplated by the business combination agreement for the merger of
FCA and PSA, on March 22, 2021, Stellantis distributed to shareholders its entire interest (approximately 39 percent) in
Faurecia, an automotive equipment supplier and formerly the automotive equipment division of PSA, to holders of Stellantis
common shares.

On December 17, 2019, FCA and PSA entered into a combination agreement (as amended, the “combination
agreement”) agreeing to merge the two groups. On January 16, 2021, PSA merged with and into FCA, with FCA as the
surviving legal entity in the merger. On January 17, 2021, the combined company was renamed Stellantis, the board of
directors was appointed and the Stellantis articles of association became effective. On this date, the Stellantis management
and board of directors collectively obtained the power and the ability to control the assets, liabilities and operations of both
FCA and PSA. As such, under IFRS 3 - Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”), January 17, 2021 is the acquisition date for the
business combination.

On January 18, 2021, Stellantis common shares began trading on Euronext Milan and Euronext Paris under the
symbol “STLA” and on January 19, 2021 on the NYSE under the symbol “STLA”. Until then, and since October 13, 2014,
the common shares of FCA were traded on the NYSE under the symbol “FCAU” and on Euronext Milan under the symbol
“FCA”,

The principal office of Stellantis is located at Taurusavenue 1, 2132LS, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands (telephone
number: +31 23 700 1511). Its agent for U.S. federal securities law purposes is Christopher J. Pardi, c/o FCA US LLC, 1000
Chrysler Drive, Auburn Hills, Michigan 48326.

Expected Merger Synergies

As a result of the merger, we expect that we will achieve significant synergies from the integration of the legacy
businesses, in particular in the following four areas:

* Technology, Platforms and Products. The sharing and convergence of platforms, modules and systems, along
with the optimization of R&D investments, with manufacturing processes and tooling, is expected to create
significant efficiencies, in particular, as investments will be amortized over the combined Company production;

+ Purchasing. Procurement savings are expected to result from leveraging the Company’s enlarged scale, leading
to lower product costs, improved price alignment and broader access to new suppliers;

+ Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”). Savings are expected from the integration of
functions such as sales and marketing, and the optimization of costs in regions where both businesses had a
well-established presence (i.e., Enlarged Europe and South America); and

+ All Other Functions. Synergies are expected from the optimization of other functions, including logistics, where
savings are expected from the optimization of logistics for new cars and the effect of the procurement volume

increase on the Company’s combined expenditures, as well as supply chain, quality and after-market operations.

In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company has achieved approximately €3.2 billion of net cash synergies.

Light trucks may be divided between vans (also known as light commercial vehicles, or “LCVs”), which typically
are used for the transportation of goods or groups of people, and pickup trucks, which are light motor vehicles with an open-
top rear cargo area. Minivans, also known as multi-purpose vehicles (“MPVs”) typically have seating for up to eight
passengers.

A vehicle is characterized as “all-new” if it is a new product with no prior model year, or if its vehicle platform is
significantly different from the platform used in the prior model year and/or it has had a full exterior renewal.

A vehicle is characterized as “significantly refreshed” if it continues its previous vehicle platform but has extensive
changes or upgrades from the prior model year.

Design and Manufacturing

We sell vehicles in the SUV, passenger car, truck and LCV markets. Our SUV and CUV portfolio includes the all-
new Grand Wagoneer, all-new Wagoneer, all-new Jeep Grand Cherokee, Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Citroén C5 Aircross, Dodge
Durango, DS 3 Crossback, Maserati Levante and Peugeot 3008. Our passenger car product portfolio includes vehicles such as

Citroén Berlingo, Opel/Vauxhall Combo and Ram ProMaster.

Historically, FCA had deployed World Class Manufacturing principles in its manufacturing operations, while PSA
implemented the PSA Excellence System at its production sites. In 2021, the systems were merged to create the Stellantis
Production Way (“SPW”). SPW is intended to achieve best in class performance as measured by health and safety, quality,
throughput, cost and environmental metrics, through empowerment of employees, enhancement of employee skill-sets, the
sharing of best practices and the improved and economical use of production assets.

Research and Development

Stellantis is continuing a commitment to research and development activities building on the legacy of both FCA
and PSA. Stellantis is engaged in research and development activities aimed at improving the design, performance, safety,
energy efficiency, reliability, consumer perception and sustainability of its products and services and to address the
challenges faced by the automotive industry, including environmental and safety regulations, emerging mobility trends,
connectivity, software and autonomous driving.

With respect to product development, Stellantis’ recent research initiatives have been mainly concentrated in the
areas of mobility electrification and clean energy, autonomous driving, and connectivity technologies. In 2021, Stellantis
announced its intent to shift to electrification for all of its brands by 2025 and is shifting its research and development
activities to focus on electrification and related technologies, as well as autonomous technology and vehicle connectivity.
Significant activity has also continued with a focus to reduce overall vehicle energy demand, fuel consumption and emissions
based on traditional technologies. Recent fuel consumption and emissions reduction activities have primarily focused on
powertrain technologies, including engines, transmissions, axles and drivelines, hybrid and electric propulsion and alternative
fuels.

New Strategic Initiatives
Modular Vehicle Platforms

In 2021, Stellantis announced a battery electric vehicle (“BEV”) platform strategy comprised of four platforms
intended to meet all customer and market needs. Each platform is designed to have a high level of flexibility (length and
width) and component sharing potential. The four platforms are:

«+ STLA Small, with a BEV range up to 500 kilometers/300 miles, designed for ultra-compact cars;

+ STLA Medium, with a BEV range up to 700 kilometers/440 miles, designed for compact to mid-size cars;

24


--- Page 16 ---

+ STLA Large, with a BEV range up to 800 kilometers/500 miles, designed for mid-size to full-size vehicles; and

+ STLA Frame, with a BEV range up to 800 kilometers/500 miles, designed for full-size SUV and pick-up trucks.

The platforms will share electrified components and be capable of adapting over time to evolutions in technology.
Full-Electric Propulsion Systems

A comprehensive strategy was also announced in 2021 for Stellantis electric powertrains centered on flexibility,
modularity and efficiency to be utilized on all four of the vehicle platforms. The strategy includes a family of three electric
drive modules (“EDM”) that combine the motor, gearbox and inverter, each designed to meet different performance needs.

The EDMs can be configured for front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive. A program of hardware
upgrades and over-the-air (“OTA”) software updates is expected to extend the life cycle of the propulsion systems and,
therefore, the vehicles. Stellantis intends to internally develop software and controls in order to maintain characteristics
unique to each brand.

Battery Cell Chemistry and Design

Development and research on battery technology is ongoing and it is planned that, by 2024, Stellantis vehicles will
be supported by two main battery chemistries:

. high energy-density (nickel-based); and
. a nickel cobalt-free alternative, offering a low, stable cost and a promising energy density.

By design, the two chemistries are intended to be upgradeable, with the ability for potential future developments,
such as cost reduction, range extensions and charging speed increases.

Autonomous Driving Technology

In July 2020, a second phase of the collaboration with Waymo (formerly the Google self-driving car project) was
announced. The first phase integrated Waymo’s self-driving technology into the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid as a development
platform for the autonomous fleets that Waymo is operating in several cities around the U.S. The second phase is expected to
focus on LCVs and to explore the potential of Level 4 automation for goods distribution.

A collaboration with Aptiv on the development of an SAE Level 2+ (hands-off the wheel) autonomous driving
system began in 2018. Testing on a fleet of vehicles with this capability has been completed and a launch is planned for 2022.

Stellantis and BMW engineers are working to develop an SAE Level 3 (hands-off the wheel, eyes-off the road)
capable autonomous driving platform. This joint work involves co-locating teams in Munich, Germany. Prototype vehicles
with early versions of the SAE Level 3 system have been running on public roads in Italy and the U.S., since 2020.

Connectivity and Software

In 2021, Stellantis announced the “STLA Brain”, a new electronic and software architecture targeted to launch across
its four battery electric vehicle platforms. The STLA Brain is a service-oriented architecture that is intended to be fully
integrated into the cloud and connects electronic control units within the vehicle with the vehicle’s computer. The STLA
Brain enables software developers to create and update features more quickly without having to update hardware. In
addition, STLA Brain is intended to be OTA capable, which will reduce costs and simplify maintenance.

In 2021, Stellantis entered into the “Mobile Drive” joint venture with Hon Hai Technology Group (“Foxconn”) and
began developing the “STLA Cockpit” smart cockpit solutions. The STLA Cockpit is intended to be layered on top of the

STLA Brain to deliver Al-based applications such as navigation, voice assistance, e-commerce, and payment services.

“STLA AutoDrive” autonomous driving capabilities are being developed in partnership with BMW and are also
intended to have the ability to be upgraded through OTA upgrades.

Hydrogen

Stellantis’ global Center of Competence Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in Russelsheim, Germany is developing fuel cell
electric vehicle technology. In the fuel cells, hydrogen is combined with air to produce electricity to drive an electric motor
where the only exhaust is pure water vapor. As a result, the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles offer a unique combination of
zero emissions, fast refueling and long driving range. In May 2021, Stellantis introduced its first hydrogen fuel cell-powered
LCV, the Opel Vivaro-e HYDROGEN. In addition, Stellantis has entered into partnerships with two suppliers, Faurecia and
Symbio, for development of the hydrogen storage system and the fuel cell system, respectively.

BEV Powertrain Technologies

Between 2019 and 2021, the full battery electric DS 3 Crossback E-Tense, Peugeot e-208 and e-2008, Opel Corsa-e
and Mokka-e and Citroén E-C4 were released in Europe. These models offer ranges of between 320 and 350 km based on
Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Testing Procedures (“WLTP”).

Beginning in 2020, we launched seven full battery electric LCV’s in Europe, including the Peugeot e-Partner, e-
Boxer and e-Expert. As of December 31, 2021, the full LCV portfolio under the Peugeot and Opel brands are offered in BEV
versions.

In early 2020, Citroén launched the fully electric AMI, an urban mobility object, which has a battery that can
recharge in three hours from a standard European electrical outlet. A BEV variant of the Fiat 500, the Fiat 500e, launched in
October 2020 and is manufactured for the European market at the Mirafiori plant in Turin, Italy. The Fiat 500e is offered in
electric ranges of 320 km and 180 km. The Fiat Ducato Electric was also unveiled in 2019 and launched in Europe for Model
Year 2021.

Stellantis intends to launch a total of 13 BEV nameplates in 2022 and 2023. By 2030, Stellantis targets to include a
BEV version of all of its passenger cars models sold in Europe and all passenger cars and light duty trucks models sold in the
US.

Hybrid Powertrain Technologies

At the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show, the plug-in hybrid variants of the Jeep Renegade and Jeep Compass
were presented. The electric units are integrated into the 1.3L turbo gasoline engine to increase efficiency and overall power
with the simultaneous action of the internal combustion engine and the electric motor delivering up to 240 hp.

Beginning in 2019, the DS7 Crossback E-Tense, Peugeot 3008 Hybrid, Peugeot 508 Hybrid and 508 SW Hybrid,
Opel Vauxhall Grandland X Hybrid and Citroén C5 Aircross SUV Hybrid were also launched. These vehicles are available
with two- and four-wheel drive, and have total power of 300hp in the four-wheel drive version and 225hp in the two-wheel
drive version. These vehicles offer ranges of up to 59km (4x4) and 56km (4x2) in full electric mode (WLTP).

In 2020, Maserati also took its first step on its electrification path with the new Maserati Ghibli mild hybrid equipped
with a 2.0L turbo with e-booster and 48-volt BSG. Also in 2020, the Jeep Renegade and Compass 4xe launched in the
European market with a range of up to 50 km on full electric propulsion at zero emission.

The Jeep hybrid lineup expanded for Model Year 2021 with the launch of the Jeep Wrangler 4xe for North America,
Europe and China markets. In 2021, the DS9 E-Tense, Peugeot 508 PSE, Peugeot 308 Hybrid, DS4 E-Tense, Opel Vauxhall
Astra Hybrid and Citroén C5 X Hybrid were also launched.

Battery Technology

In 2020, Automotive Cell Company (“ACC”), an equity method joint venture with Total/Saft, was formed for the
development and manufacture of high-performance batteries for the automotive industry. A research and development center
in Bordeaux and a pilot site in Nersac (France) were established by Automotive Cell Company to develop high-performance
lithium-ion technologies for electric car batteries. Production by the joint venture is planned to be launched in Douvrin
(France) in 2023. In September 2021, it was announced that Mercedes-Benz AG has agreed to join ACC as its third partner.

26


--- Page 18 ---

In October 2021, we entered into separate memoranda of understanding with LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI
to form joint ventures for the production of battery cells and modules for North America. Production by the joint venture
with LG Energy Solutions is targeted to begin in the first quarter of 2024. The joint venture with Samsung SDI is targeted to
begin production in 2025.

Vehicle Energy Demand

Stellantis research and development efforts regarding vehicle energy demand have been focused on reducing energy
loss, enhancing integration and improving overall vehicle efficiency.

Reductions in energy losses have been concentrated on weight reduction with the adoption of lightweight materials
for closures and structural components; aerodynamic drag improvements through static shape, aero shields, adjustable height
suspension and active front air dams; and lower rolling resistance tires. Additional development has also included reductions
in driveline energy loss, and the optimization of several electrical loads through the implementation of technologies.

Stellantis continues to undertake development activities on systems integration to find technical solutions for vehicle
energy demand. Internal combustion engines with 12v batteries are designed to be recharged by high efficiency alternators.
The HVAC systems on PHEV and BEVs are designed to integrate both the cabin and battery cooling systems with the
adoption of fully electric air conditioning and advanced thermal management systems to control cabin temperatures.

Intellectual Property

Stellantis owns a significant number of patents, trade secrets, licenses, trademarks and service marks, including, in
particular, the marks of its vehicle and component and production systems brands, which relate to its products and services.
We expect the number to grow as we continue to pursue technological innovations. We file patent applications in Europe, the
U.S. and around the world to protect technology and improvements considered important to our business. No single patent is
material to our business as a whole.

Property, Plant and Equipment

As of December 31, 2021, Stellantis manufacturing facilities (including vehicle and light commercial vehicle
assembly, powertrain and components plants, and excluding joint ventures), are primarily located in Enlarged Europe (mainly
in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico) and South America (Brazil and
Argentina). Stellantis companies have also historically owned other significant properties including parts distribution centers,
research laboratories, test tracks, warehouses and office buildings. The total carrying value of Stellantis’ property, plant and
equipment as of December 31, 2021 was €35.5 billion.

A number of Stellantis manufacturing facilities and equipment, including land and industrial buildings, plant and
machinery and other assets, were and are subject to mortgages and other security interests granted to secure indebtedness to
certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2021, property, plant and equipment reported as pledged as collateral for
loans amounted to approximately €1.4 billion, excluding Right-of-use assets (refer to Note 11, Property, plant and
equipment).

Stellantis was not aware of any environmental issues that would materially affect the utilization of fixed assets. See
Industrial Environmental Control.

Supply of Raw Materials, Parts and Components

Stellantis purchases a variety of components (including but not exclusively, mechanical, steel, electrical, electronic
and plastic components as well as castings and tires), raw materials, supplies, utilities, logistics and other services from
numerous suppliers. The purchase of raw materials, parts and components has historically accounted for 70-80 percent of
total Cost of revenues. Of these purchases, 10-20 percent relates to the cost of raw materials, including but not exclusively
steel, rubber, aluminum, resin, copper, lead, and precious metals (including platinum, palladium and rhodium).

27


--- Page 19 ---

Stellantis’ focus on quality improvement, cost reduction, product innovation and production flexibility requires the
Company to rely upon suppliers with a focus on quality and the ability to provide cost reductions. Stellantis has valued
relationships with suppliers, and works to establish closer ties with a significantly reduced number of suppliers by selecting
those that enjoy a leading position in the relevant markets. In addition, Stellantis sources some of the parts and components
for vehicles internally from Teksid. Subsequent to the sale of parts of Teksid's cast iron business, Stellantis entered into a
long-term supply agreement with the acquirer, Tupy S.A. Stellantis previously agreed to a multi-year supply agreement with
Marelli in connection with the sale of that business.

Stellantis experienced a loss of approximately 20 percent of its planned 2021 production as a result of unfilled
semiconductor orders. Stellantis also experienced a significant increase in the cost of raw materials which has partially been
mitigated with merger synergies and a shortage of certain key components in 2021, but did not otherwise experience any
major production losses as a result of material or parts shortages. Stellantis regularly sources some of its systems,
components, parts, equipment and tooling from a single provider or limited number of providers. As with unfilled
semiconductor orders in 2021, we are at risk of production delays and lost production should any supplier fail to deliver
goods and services on time. In addition, although we have recently entered into several significant agreements with battery
and raw material suppliers, as we implement our vehicle electrification strategy, our dependence on a significant supply of
battery components and related raw materials will also increase. See also “Risk Factors - We face risks associated with
increases in costs, disruptions of supply or shortages of raw materials, parts, components and systems used in our vehicles.’
and “Risk Factors - The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could continue to disrupt the manufacture and sale of our
products and the provision of our services and adversely impact our business.”

Supply of raw materials, parts and components can also be disrupted or interrupted by natural disasters. In such
circumstances, Stellantis works proactively with suppliers to identify material and part shortages and take steps to mitigate
their impact by deploying additional personnel, accessing alternative sources of supply and managing its production
schedules. Stellantis also continues to refine processes to identify emerging capacity constraints in the supplier tiers given the
ramp up in manufacturing volumes to meet volume targets. Furthermore, Stellantis continuously monitors supplier
performance according to key metrics such as part quality, delivery, performance, financial solvency and sustainability.

The number of employees as of December 31, 2019, was 113,967 for former PSA excluding Faurecia and 191,752
for former FCA, respectively.

Stellantis employees are free to join any trade union, provided they do so in accordance with local laws and the rules
of the related trade union. Local collective agreements are led by the regions and/or countries which take the global Company
polices into account and reflect local particularities.

An active dialogue has been maintained in 2021 with various employee representation bodies existing at a
transnational level, notably the European Works Councils for former PSA and former FCA employees whose mandates are

respected.
Trade Unions and Collective Bargaining
In 2021, approximately 87 percent of the workforce are covered by a collective agreement.

Stellantis is committed to enacting a high-quality collective agreements strategy, based on a sound understanding of
the Company, seeking out innovative solutions and demonstrating a capacity to reconcile the Company’s economic and social
challenges. During 2021, examples of innovative solutions include:

* The first Stellantis plant dedicated to BEV was established in the UK and a new agreement was signed to allow
the plant transformation to produce BEV and LCV.

* In France and Italy, the plants in Douvrin and Melfi have been converted to battery production instead of
internal combustion engine production.

* In Germany, agreement was reached with the trade unions to modernize the pension scheme.

In 2021, more than 450 collective agreements were in place worldwide and a majority of the Company workers were
covered by a collective bargaining agreement at sector or Company level. Stellantis adopts an open approach to communicate
with employees in countries where there is not an obligation for trade union implementation. As an example, in China, the
mechanism of Voice of Employees (VOE) has been set up to work as a proactive bridge between employees and
management. VOE representatives are consulted by the management over all important employee-related policy matters.
VOE representatives communicate to China employees about Stellantis strategies and latest news and disclosures.

The Company endorses the United Nations (“UN”) declaration on human rights and the International Labor
Organization’s declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work.

Sales Overview

New vehicle sales represent sales of vehicles primarily by dealers and distributors, or, directly by us in some cases,
to retail customers and fleet customers. Sales include mass-market and luxury vehicles manufactured at our plants, as well as
vehicles manufactured by joint ventures and third party contract manufacturers and distributed under our brands. Sales
figures exclude sales of vehicles that we contract manufacture for other OEMs. While vehicle sales are illustrative of our
competitive position and the demand for our vehicles, sales are not directly correlated to Net revenues, Cost of revenues or
other measures of financial performance in any given period, as such results were primarily driven by vehicle shipments to
dealers and distributors or to retail and fleet customers. For a discussion of our shipments, see FINANCIAL OVERVIEW—
Shipment Information. Sales and market shares for 2020 and 2019 reported in the tables below are the aggregation of FCA
and PSA while 2021 also includes FCA for the period from January | to January 16, prior to the merger. The following table

U.S. industry sales, including medium and heavy-duty vehicles, were 17.5 million units in 2019 and fell to 14.9
million units in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, then rising to 15.3 million units in 2021. The strong recovery in the
automotive sector in 2021 was supported by the general economic rebound after the pandemic with the size of the recovery
negatively impacted by unfilled semiconductor orders.

Our vehicle line-up in the North America segment primarily leveraged the brand recognition of the Jeep, Ram,
Dodge and Chrysler brands to offer utility vehicles, pickup trucks, cars and minivans under those brands. Vehicle sales and
profitability in the North America segment were generally weighted towards larger vehicles such as utility vehicles, trucks
and vans, consistent with overall industry sales trends in the North America segment, which have become increasingly
weighted towards utility vehicles and trucks in recent years.

The decrease in 2021 sales compared to 2020 resulted primarily from supply issues related to the ongoing unfilled
semiconductor orders and pandemic recovery, coupled with a pent-up demand for Jeep and Ram brand vehicles. Jeep
expanded its market coverage with the all-new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer in the premium vehicle segment, in addition
to introducing the all-new Jeep Grand Cherokee and the all-new Jeep Grand Cherokee L three row vehicle.

North America Distribution

In the North America segment, our vehicles are sold primarily to dealers in our dealer network for sale to retail
consumers and to fleet customers. Fleet sales in the commercial channel are typically more profitable than sales in the
government and daily rental channels since they more often involve customized vehicles with more optional features and
accessories; however, vehicle orders in the commercial channel are usually smaller in size than the orders made in the daily
rental channel. Fleet sales in the government channel are generally more profitable than fleet sales in the daily rental channel
primarily due to the mix of products included in each respective channel.

North America Dealer and Customer Financing

In the North America segment, on November 1, 2021, Stellantis closed a previously announced acquisition of First
Investors Financial Services Group, which has been renamed Stellantis Financial Services US Corp (“Stellantis Financial
Services”). Stellantis Financial Services will provide U.S. customers and dealers with a complete range of financing options
in the near-to-medium term, including retail loans, leases, and floorplan financing however as at today Stellantis relies upon
independent financial service providers, including Santander Consumer USA Inc. (“SCUSA”) to provide financing for
dealers and retail customers in the U.S. In February 2013, FCA entered into a private label financing agreement with SCUSA
(the “SCUSA Agreement”), under which SCUSA will continue to provide a wide range of wholesale and retail financial
services to dealers and retail customers in the U.S., under the Chrysler Capital brand name and covering the Chrysler, Jeep,
Dodge, Ram, Fiat and Alfa Romeo brands.

31


--- Page 23 ---

The SCUSA Agreement has a ten year term expiring in April 2023, subject to early termination in certain
circumstances, including the failure by a party to comply with certain of its ongoing obligations under the agreement. Under
the SCUSA Agreement, SCUSA has certain rights, including limited exclusivity to participate in specified minimum
percentages of certain retail financing rate subvention programs. SCUSA’s exclusivity rights will continue to be subject to
SCUSA maintaining certain performance standards and price competitiveness, based on minimum approval rates and market
benchmark rates to be determined through a steering committee process, as set out in the SCUSA Agreement.

On June 28, 2019, FCA US entered into an amendment (the “Amendment’’) to the SCUSA Agreement. The
Amendment modified certain terms of the agreement, with the remaining term unchanged through to April 2023 and, in
connection with its execution, SCUSA made a one-time, nonrefundable, non-contingent, cash payment of U.S.$60 million
(€53 million) to FCA US as part of a negotiated resolution of open matters. Refer to Note 26, Guarantees granted,
commitments and contingent liabilities, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

As of December 31, 2021, SCUSA provided wholesale lines of credit to approximately 9 percent of our dealers in
the U.S., while Ally Financial Inc. (“Ally”) was at 31 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 85
percent of the vehicles purchased by our U.S. retail customers were financed or leased, of which approximately 48 percent
financed or leased through SCUSA (34 percent) and Ally (14 percent). Alfa Romeo brand development within the U.S. was
also supported by dealer and retail customer financing with primary financial institutions. Additionally, we have
arrangements with a number of financial institutions to provide a variety of dealer and retail customer financing programs in
Canada.

In Mexico, we have a private label agreement with Inbursa Group for the former FCA brands in order to provide
dealer and retail customer financing programs. We also operate in Mexico through a partnership with Santander, to provide
retail financing to the Peugeot brand customers. Wholesale financing to dealer networks is provided by BPF Finance México
S.A. de C.V., SOFOM (a fully owned subsidiary of Banque PSA Finance) to Peugeot dealers in Mexico. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, approximately 26 percent of the vehicles purchased by our Mexican retail customers were financed or
leased through Santander Mexico.

We have decided to regroup all financing activities in Mexico for all Brands under the partnership with Inbursa. As a
consequence of such orientation, in November 2021, a share purchase agreement was signed by BPF with Grupo Financiero
Inbursa for the acquisition by the latter of the entire share capital of BPF Finance México S.A. de C.V., SOFOM.

(2) Excluding Maserati.

Automotive industry volumes within the countries in which the South America segment operates increased 13.9
percent from 2020 to 3.5 million vehicles (cars and light commercial vehicles) in 2021, which was primarily driven by the
impact of COVID-19 on the South America automotive industry in 2020. Overall there was a 1.2 percent increase in the
industry in Brazil, reflecting the unfilled semiconductor orders, which has affected the production capacity, and a 9.7 percent
increase in the industry in Argentina, reflecting the gradual recovery of sales and the country's economy.

Stellantis’ market share in South America increased 380 basis points from 19.1 percent in 2020 to 22.9 percent in
2021, primarily reflecting market share growth in Brazil, driven by all Stellantis brands, mainly Fiat, which led the Brazilian
market. In Brazil, overall market share increased 850 basis points to 32.0 percent in 2021 from 23.5 percent in 2020 while, in
Argentina, overall market share increased 350 basis points to 29.1 percent in 2021 from 25.6 percent in 2020.

Our vehicle line-up in South America leverages the brand recognition of Fiat, as well as the relatively urban
population of countries like Brazil, and offers vehicles in smaller segments, such as the Fiat Argo as well as the Fiat Mobi.
Fiat also led the pickup truck market in Brazil, with the all-new Fiat Strada and the Fiat Toro (both represent a total of 50.2
percent market share in the segment). Jeep led the SUV segment in Brazil with 22.2 percent market share primarily based on
the performance of the Jeep Renegade and the Jeep Compass. Peugeot and Citroén are conquering new consumers and grew,
respectively, 119.1 percent and 73.2 percent in sales compared to 2020.

South America Distribution

In South America, law in each country regulates retail vehicle distribution. In Brazil and Argentina, distribution is
done through dealers of each brand, although it is common for the same distributor to have several stores in order to serve
different brands. In other countries, distribution is done through multi-brands importers or dealers.

South America Dealer and Customer Financing

In the South America segment, we provide access to dealer and retail customer financing both through 100 percent
owned captive finance companies and also through strategic relationships with financial institutions.

33


--- Page 25 ---

We have two 100 percent owned captive finance companies in the South America segment that offer dealer and
retail customer financing: Banco Fidis S.A. (“Banco Fidis”) in Brazil and FCA Compajiia Financiera S.A. in Argentina and
two 50 percent owned joint ventures: Banco PSA Finance Brasil S.A. (with Santander) and PSA Finance Argentina
Compafia Financiera S.A. (with BBVA) that offer dealer and retail customer financing. In addition, in Brazil we have two
significant commercial partnerships with Banco Ital and Bradesco to provide financing to retail customers purchasing our
branded vehicles. Banco Itati is a leading vehicle retail financing company in Brazil and our partnership was renewed in
August 2013 for a ten-year term ending in 2023. Under this agreement, which applied only to our retail customers purchasing
Fiat branded vehicles, Banco Itat has exclusivity on our promotional campaigns and preferential rights on non-promotional
financing. We receive commissions in connection with each vehicle financing above a certain threshold. In July 2015, Fiat
Chrysler Automoveis Brasil (“FCA Brasil”) and Banco Fidis signed a ten-year partnership contract with Bradesco, one of the
leading Brazilian banks, through its affiliate Bradesco Financiamentos, whereby Bradesco Financiamentos finances retail
sales of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram vehicles in Brazil. Under this agreement, Bradesco has exclusivity on promotional
campaigns and FCA Brasil promotes Bradesco as FCA Brasil’s official financial partner. Banco Fidis is in charge of the
commercial management of this partnership and receives commissions for this partnership agreement and for acting as
banking agent, based on profitability and penetration.

In 2021, the automotive industry in Europe 30 is in line with 2020, still negatively impacted by COVID-19
pandemic and, especially in the second half, by semiconductors shortage.

The Company's overall market share in 2021 in Enlarged Europe 30 is in line with in 2020 at 22.1 percent, primarily
reflecting 0.4 percent volume increase with the main contribution of Jeep (increase of 5.3 percent) and Opel/Vauxhall
(increase of 2.3 percent). In 2021 Stellantis also maintained commercial vehicles market leadership with 33.7 percent.

In Enlarged Europe, our sales are largely weighted to passenger cars, with an estimation of 48.1 percent of total
vehicle sales in the small car segment for 2021, reflecting demand for smaller vehicles due to driving conditions prevalent in
many European cities and stringent environmental regulations.

Enlarged Europe Distribution

In Europe, our relationship with individual dealer entities may be represented by a number of contracts (typically,
we enter into one agreement per brand of vehicles to be sold), and the dealer can sell those vehicles through one or more
points of sale.

We sell our vehicles directly to independent and our owned dealer entities located in most European markets, as well
as to fleet customers (including government and rental). In other markets and in segments in which we do not have a
substantial presence, we have agreements with general distributors.

Stellantis has engaged during 2021 a transformation process by terminating its distribution contracts and at the same
time consulting its networks on the future distribution model. This process was undertaken in anticipation of implementing
new distribution schemes as of June 2023.

Enlarged Europe Dealer and Customer Financing

In the Enlarged Europe segment, dealer and retail customer financing is managed by FCA Bank, a 50 percent joint
venture with Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance S.A. (“CACF”) as for the former FCA brands (Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Dodge,
Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Chrysler, Maserati & Ram), and by BPF as for the former PSA brands (through two
partnerships described below). FCA Bank operates in Europe, including the five major markets of Italy, France, Germany,
Spain and the UK, and provides dealer and retail financing and, within selected countries, also rentals to support the former
FCA vehicle brands. FCA Bank provides its services to the Maserati luxury brand, as well as certain other OEMs, including
Ferrari. The joint venture with CACF was initially entered into in 2006 and was thereafter renewed with a term extended
through December 31, 2024. BPF operates through two 50 percent joint ventures under the umbrella of two major
partnerships in Europe, one with Group Santander Consumer Finance (“SCF”) for the Peugeot, Citroén and DS brands, and
one with BNP Paribas Personal Finance (“BNPP PF’’) for the Opel and Vauxhall brands. The partnership with SCF began in
2015 with an initial duration of 10 years and with BNPP PF in 2017 with an initial duration of 12 years.

35


--- Page 27 ---

On December 17, 2021, Stellantis announced the intention to reorganize its leasing activities in Europe with the
intention to create a European multi-brand operational leasing company with CACF (with each of Stellantis and CACF
holding a 50 percent interest) that would result from the combination of the leasing activities of Leasys, currently a 100
percent owned subsidiary of FCA Bank, and the activities of Free2Move Lease (“F2ML”), a business unit created within the
former Groupe PSA and which aims to develop the business to business (““B2B”) long-term leasing activity. In addition, the
joint ventures with BNPP PF and SCF are planned to be reorganized so the joint ventures with BNPP PF will operate
financing activities in Germany, Austria and in the UK and joint ventures with SCF will operate financing activities in
France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Poland, the Netherlands and through a commercial agreement with SCF in Portugal. The joint
ventures’ financing activities will cover all Stellantis brands.The proposed transactions are targeted to be signed in the first
quarter of 2022 and completed during the first half of 2023.

Sales activities within certain Eastern European countries are supported by private label agreements with local banks
covering both the wholesale and retail financing needs.

Maserati excluded from volumes and market share of the region.

In 2021, the total industry volume of Middle East & Africa demonstrated a solid growth of 19.3 percent, despite
volatility and sensitivity to the geopolitical environment and supply constraints, for instance, leading to the decrease of 4.6
percent in the Turkey market. As such, Stellantis increased its sales volumes by 3.8 percent with 411 thousand deliveries and
market share gains in most of the major countries.

Despite this dynamism, overall market share of the region reached 11.9 percent, down by 170 basis points as
compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to negative country mix, mainly Turkey, and availability of supply in the
second half of 2021 for Egypt and Turkey, where Stellantis confirmed its leadership reaching 23.3 percent and 29.7 percent,
respectively.

LCV sales increased by 22 percent, up to 105 thousand units, sustained by leadership in the vans segment, and the
launch of new offers in the pick up segment, such as the new Peugeot Landtrek.

Maserati excluded from volumes and market share.

The automotive industry in the China and India & Asia Pacific segment has shown a year-over-year growth, with
industry sales in the six key markets (China, India, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Asean & General Distributors (“AGD”)
increasing by 4.7 percent to 33.2 million units. The increase in demand was primarily driven by key markets recovering from
the impacts of COVID-19 that mainly affected 2020. In the later part of 2021, impacts from unfilled semiconductor orders
were also felt which slowed down the recovery rate and drove a year-over-year decline in Japan and South Korea. Markets
with increasing demand from 2020 to 2021 were China (4.0 percent), AGD (7.7 percent), India (27.0 percent) and Australia
(14.3 percent), while markets with decreasing demand were Japan (-3.5 percent) and South Korea (-9.2 percent).

We sell a range of vehicles in the China and India & Asia Pacific segment, including small and compact cars,
premium mid-size cars, sports utility vehicles and light commercial vehicles. Although our smallest segment by vehicle sales,
China and India & Asia Pacific segment represents a significant growth opportunity and we are invested in building
relationships with key partners in China and India to increase our manufacturing footprint and presence in the region. In the
China and India & Asia Pacific segment we also distribute vehicles that are manufactured in the U.S. and Europe through our
dealers and distributors.

China and India & Asia Pacific Distribution

In the key markets in the China and India & Asia Pacific segment (China, Australia, India, Japan, South Korean and
AGD), we sell our vehicles through 100 percent owned subsidiaries or through our joint ventures, GAC FCA JV and DPCA
JV to local independent dealers. The Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Automobile Sales Co (“DPCS”) markets the vehicles
produced by DPCA in China. We operate through national sales companies in Australia, Japan, India and South Korea. In
AGD and smaller markets, we have agreements with general distributors.

China and India & Asia Pacific Dealer and Customer Financing

In China, we operate a 100 percent owned captive finance company, FCA Automotive Finance Co., Ltd, which
supports our sales activities in China on a non-exclusive basis through dealer and retail customer financing. Cooperation
agreements are in place with third-party financial institutions to provide dealer network and retail customer financing in
India, South Korea, Australia and Japan.

We also operate two joint finance companies with the Dongfeng Motor Group (“Dongfeng”’), namely Dongfeng
Peugeot Citroén Auto Finance Company Ltd and Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Financial Leasing Co, which provide the
financing of the Dongfeng Peugeot and Dongfeng Citroén brands in China as well as leasing solutions.

Maserati

In 2021, Maserati debuted the new Levante Hybrid which became the Brand’s first hybrid SUV, after the successful
launch of its first hybrid vehicle, the Ghibli Hybrid in 2020. After revealing in 2020 the all-new Maserati MC20 super sport
car, equipped with the new Maserati-built Nettuno engine, deliveries started in September 2021. The flow of new product
will continue in 2022 with the all-new Grecale to be revealed in March 2022, with deliveries to start in mid-2022; followed
by the MC20 Retractable Hard Top and the reveal of the all-new GranTurismo, in internal combustion engine (“ICE”) and
BEV versions, in late 2022.

The following table shows the distribution of Maserati sales by geographic regions and as a percentage of total sales
for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:

As a percentage As a percentage As a percentage

(1) Italy, United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland.

In 2021, a total of 24.3 thousand Maserati vehicles were sold, showing an increase of 41.4 percent compared to 2020
as a result of strong sales performance in China, U.S., Europe and other key markets, surpassing the 6 percent increase of
industry volumes in the Maserati relevant segments.

FCA Bank provides access to dealer and retail customer financing for Maserati brand vehicles in Europe and our
100 percent owned captive finance company, FCA Automotive Finance Co. Ltd, provides dealer and retail financing on a
non-exclusive basis in China. In other regions, we rely on local agreements with financial services providers for the financing
of Maserati brand vehicles to dealers and end customers.

Cyclical Nature of the Business

As is typical in the automotive industry, Stellantis’ vehicle sales are highly sensitive to general economic conditions,
availability of low interest rate vehicle financing for dealers and retail customers and other external factors, including fuel
prices, and as a result could vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year. Retail consumers tend to delay the
purchase of a new vehicle when disposable income and consumer confidence is low. Moreover, increases in inflation may
lead to subsequent increases in the cost of borrowing and availability of affordable credit for vehicle financing, which may
further influence retail consumers to delay the purchase of a new vehicle. In addition, Stellantis’ vehicle production volumes
and related revenues could vary from month to month, sometimes due to plant shutdowns, which could occur for several
reasons including raw material or component unavailability, production changes from one model year to the next and actions
to balance vehicle supply and demand fluctuations and also to adjust dealer stock levels appropriately. Plant shutdowns,
whether associated with model year changeovers or other factors such as temporary supplier interruptions, could have a
negative impact on Stellantis’ revenues and working capital as Stellantis continues to pay suppliers under established terms
while Stellantis would not receive proceeds from vehicle sales. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity
Overview for additional information.

Legal Proceedings
Takata airbag inflators

Putative class action lawsuits were filed in March 2018 against FCA US LLC (“FCA US”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Stellantis, in the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of Florida and the Eastern District of Michigan,
asserting claims under federal and state laws alleging economic loss due to Takata airbag inflators installed in certain of our
vehicles.

Emissions Matters

On January 10, 2019, FCA US announced it had reached final settlements on civil environmental and consumer
claims with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(“DoJ”), the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”), the State of California, 49 other States and U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, for which we accrued €748 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately €350 million of the
amount accrued by FCA US, which was prior to the merger, was related to civil penalties to resolve differences over diesel
emissions requirements. A portion of the amount accrued, prior to the merger, was attributable to settlement of a putative
class action on behalf of consumers in connection with which FCA US agreed to pay an average of $2,800 per vehicle to
eligible customers affected by the recall. That settlement received final court approval on May 3, 2019. On April 9, 2021,
FCA US reached an agreement with substantially all of the approximately 3,200 consumers that exercised their right to opt
out of the class action settlement to settle their claims for an amount that is not material to the Company. As of December 31,
2021, our best estimate of a probable loss is reflected in the amount previously accrued prior to the merger.

In the U.S., we remain subject to a diesel emissions-related investigation by the DoJ, Criminal Division. In
September 2019, the DoJ filed criminal charges against an employee of FCA US for, among other things, fraud, conspiracy,
false statements and violations of the Clean Air Act primarily in connection with efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the
vehicles that were the subject of the civil settlements described above. In April 2021, two additional employees of a Stellantis
subsidiary were indicted by the DoJ on similar charges. The three employees were placed on administrative leave following
their indictments. We have continued discussions with the DoJ, Criminal Division to determine whether we can reach an
appropriate resolution of their investigation as it relates to FCA US. Resolution of the investigation may involve the payment
of penalties and other non-financial sanctions. While the outcome of these discussions is uncertain and we cannot predict
whether or when any settlement may be reached with the DoJ, Criminal Division, or the ultimate outcome of its investigation,
prior to the merger, we accrued approximately €200 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as our best
estimate of probable loss with regard to matters under discussion. In light of subsequent progress in our discussions with the
DoJ, Criminal Division, we have increased our accrual for this matter to approximately €266 million, which reflects our best
estimate at this time. We also remain subject to a number of related private lawsuits (the “Non Opt-Out Litigation”).

We have also received inquiries from other regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions as they examine the

on-road tailpipe emissions of several automakers’ vehicles and, when jurisdictionally appropriate, we continue to cooperate
with these governmental agencies and authorities.

In Europe, we have continued to work with the Italian Ministry of Transport (“MIT”) and the Dutch Vehicle
Regulator (“RDW”), the authorities that certified FCA diesel vehicles for sale in the European Union, and the UK Driver and
Vehicle Standards Agency in connection with their review of several diesel models.

We also responded to inquiries from the German authority, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (“KBA”), regarding emissions
test results for FCA diesel vehicles, and discussed the KBA reported test results, our emission control calibrations and the
features of the vehicles in question. After these initial discussions, the MIT, which has sole authority for regulatory
compliance of the vehicles it has certified, asserted its exclusive jurisdiction over the matters raised by the KBA, tested the
vehicles, determined that the vehicles complied with applicable European regulations and informed the KBA of its
determination. Thereafter, mediations were held under European Commission (“EC”) rules, between the MIT and the
German Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, which oversees the KBA, in an effort to resolve their differences.
The mediation concluded and no action was taken with respect to FCA. In May 2017, the EC announced its intention to open
an infringement procedure against Italy regarding Italy's alleged failure to respond to EC's concerns regarding certain FCA
emission control calibrations. The MIT responded to the EC's allegations by confirming that the vehicles' approval process
was properly performed. On December 2, 2021, the EC notified Italy of its position that Italy did not comply with its
obligation to enforce EU emission type approval rules.

In December 2019, the MIT notified FCA of communications with the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water
Management (“I&W”) regarding certain irregularities allegedly found by the RDW and the Dutch Center of Research TNO in
the emission levels of certain Jeep Grand Cherokee Euro 5 models and a vehicle model of another OEM containing a Euro 6
diesel engine supplied by FCA. In January 2020, the Dutch Parliament published a letter from the I&W summarizing the
conclusions of the RDW regarding those vehicles and engines and indicating an intention to order a recall and report their
findings to the Public Prosecutor, the EC and other Member States. FCA engaged with the RDW to present our positions and
cooperate to reach an appropriate resolution of this matter. FCA proposed certain updates to the relevant vehicles that have
been tested and approved by the RDW and are now being implemented. Nevertheless, this matter is still pending.

In addition, as part of the judicial investigation of several automakers in France, commencing in 2016 and 2017,
Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroén were placed under examination by the Judicial Court of Paris in June 2021 on
allegations of consumer fraud in connection with the sale of Euro 5 diesel vehicles in France between 2009 and 2015. In July
2021, FCA Italy was placed under examination by the same court for possible consumer fraud in connection with the sale of
Euro 6 diesel vehicles in France between 2014 and 2017. FCA Italy was also designated as a material witness in connection
with allegations of obstruction of the actions of an economy ministry antifraud inspector in 2016 and 2017. As is typical in a
French criminal inquiry, each of the companies were required to pay bail for the potential payment of damages and fines and
to ensure representation in court, and to provide a guarantee for the potential compensation of losses. None of these amounts
were, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company.

In July 2020, unannounced inspections took place at several of FCA’s sites in Germany, Italy and the UK at the
initiative of the Public Prosecutors of Frankfurt am Main and of Turin, as part of their investigations of potential violations of
diesel emissions regulations and consumer protection laws. We have also responded to limited inquiries from the Public
Prosecutor of Frankfurt relating to PSA vehicles and a PSA engine. We continue to cooperate with these investigations.

Several former FCA companies and our Dutch dealers have also been served with a purported class action filed in
the Netherlands by a Dutch foundation seeking monetary damages and vehicle buybacks in connection with alleged
emissions non-compliance of certain diesel vehicles. We are aware of similar claims in Portugal and the Netherlands
regarding PSA vehicles, and the UK regarding vehicles of our brands (both FCA and PSA). We have also received notice of
a purported securities class action in the Netherlands, alleging misrepresentations by FCA, now Stellantis. We are defending
approximately 6,000 individual consumer claims alleging emissions non-compliance of certain former FCA vehicles in
Germany. We are also defending a small number of similar claims in Austria.

In December 2018, the Korean Ministry of Environment (“MOE”) announced its determination that approximately
2,400 FCA vehicles imported into Korea during 2015, 2016 and 2017 were not emissions compliant and that the vehicles
with a subsequent update of the emission control calibrations voluntarily performed by FCA, although compliant, would have
required re-homologation of the vehicles concerned. In May 2019, the MOE revoked certification of the above-referenced
vehicles and announced an administrative fine for an amount not material to the Company. Our appeal of the MOE’s decision
was rejected and we are now pursuing jurisdictional appeals. In November 2021, the MOE issued notice of its intention to
impose a recall order, revocation of certification and an administrative fine on the basis of the alleged non-compliance of
approximately 2,400 other FCA vehicles. Our subsidiary in Seoul, Korea is also cooperating with local criminal authorities in
connection with their review of these matters and is appealing a decision of the Korean Fair Trade Commission imposing an
administrative fine for a purported breach of the Act on Fair Labeling and Advertisement in connection with the vehicles
imported into Korea between 2015 and 2017.

National Training Center

On January 27, 2021, FCA US announced an agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of
Michigan to resolve its investigation into past misconduct of certain former FCA US employees involving the UAW-Chrysler
National Training Center (“NTC”). Pursuant to the agreement, which received court approval on July 19, 2021, FCA US
agreed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to violate the Labor Management Relations Act and the payment of a
fine in an amount that is not material to the Company and which was accrued prior to the merger. FCA US also agreed to
implement an independent compliance monitor for three years with respect to the dissolution of the NTC and internal controls
as they relate to the trusts being implemented to replace the NTC.

Several putative class action lawsuits have been filed against FCA US in U.S. federal court alleging harm to UAW
workers as a result of these acts. Those actions have been dismissed both at the trial court stage and on appeal. Three
plaintiffs in these lawsuits also filed charges alleging unfair labor practices with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (the
“Board”). The Board issued a complaint regarding these allegations and sought a cease and desist order as well as the posting
of a notification with respect to the alleged practices, but subsequently dismissed the charges.

On July 20, 2020, a group of employees in FCA’s Toledo, Ohio Jeep plant filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Ohio against FCA US, the UAW and certain individuals claiming violations of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and civil conspiracy. On October 20, 2020, FCA US filed a motion to
dismiss. Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on June 25, 2021.

On October 16, 2020 and February 28, 2021, lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan, by groups of current and former employees making similar claims. We have filed motions to dismiss in both cases
and those motions remain pending.

General Motors Litigation

On November 20, 2019, General Motors LLC and General Motors Company (collectively, “GM”) filed a lawsuit in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against FCA US, FCA N.V., now Stellantis N.V., and certain
individuals, claiming violations of the RICO Act, unfair competition and civil conspiracy in connection with allegations that
FCA US made payments to UAW officials that corrupted the bargaining process with the UAW and as a result FCA US
enjoyed unfair labor costs and operational advantages that caused harm to GM. GM also claimed that FCA US had made
concessions to the UAW in collective bargaining that the UAW was then able to extract from GM through pattern bargaining
which increased costs to GM and that this was done by FCA US in an effort to force a merger between GM and FCAN.V..
The court dismissed GM’s lawsuit with prejudice. GM appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit and oral argument on that appeal was held on March 4, 2021 but no decision has been rendered.

Following dismissal of its Federal court case, GM filed an action against FCA US and FCA N.V., now Stellantis
N.V., in Michigan state court, making substantially the same claims as it made in the federal litigation. FCA US and FCA
N.V. filed a motion for summary disposition in the state court case and GM filed a motion to compel discovery. On October
15, 2021, the court granted Stellantis N.V. and FCA US’s motion for summary disposition. GM filed a motion for
reconsideration and on December 6, 2021, the court granted GM’s motion. GM filed a second amended complaint on
December 23, 2021. On February 4, 2022, the court denied our motion for a protective order and ordered that some
discovery would be allowed before the court rules on the pending motion for summary disposition.

Tigershark Engine

In addition, putative class action lawsuits have been filed against FCA US and consolidated into a single action in
U.S. District court in Michigan asserting claims under federal and state laws claiming manufacturing and design defects in
certain vehicles equipped with the 2.4L Tigershark engine, which has been installed in approximately 1.6 million vehicles
sold in the U.S. The claims allege excessive oil consumption and related excess emissions. In November 2021, we entered
into an agreement in principle to settle the litigation, contingent on court approval, for an amount that is not material to the

Company.

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters

At Stellantis, we engineer, manufacture and sell our products and offer our services around the world, subject to
requirements applicable to our products that relate to vehicle emissions, fuel economy, emission control software calibration
and on-board diagnostics, as well as those applicable to our manufacturing facilities that relate to stack emissions, the
treatment of waste, water and hazardous materials, prohibitions on soil contamination, and worker health and safety. Our
vehicles and the propulsion systems that power them must also comply with extensive regional, national and local laws and
regulations and industry self-regulations (including those that regulate end-of-life vehicles (“ELVs’) and the chemical
content of our parts). In addition, vehicle safety regulations are becoming increasingly strict.

We believe we are substantially in compliance with the relevant global regulatory requirements affecting our
facilities and products taken as a whole, although we may from time to time fail to meet a particular regulatory requirement.
We consistently monitor the relevant global regulatory requirements affecting our facilities and products and adjust our
operations and processes as we seek to remain in compliance. Compliance with these requirements involves significant costs
and risks. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate-Current and more
stringent future or incremental laws, regulations and governmental policies, including those regarding increased fuel
efficiency requirements and reduced greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions, have a significant effect on how we do business
and may increase our cost of compliance, result in additional liabilities and negatively affect our operations and results.” and
“Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate-We remain subject to ongoing
diesel emissions investigations by several governmental agencies and to a number of related private lawsuits, which may lead
to further claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions, and result in additional penalties, settlements or damage awards and
may also adversely affect our reputation with consumers.”

Automotive Tailpipe Emissions

Numerous laws and regulations place limits on vehicle emissions, including standards on tailpipe exhaust emissions
standards and evaporative emissions. These standards govern a category of emissions called “criteria emissions” that does not
include greenhouse gases (““GHGs”). Related laws impose requirements on how vehicles’ emission control software is
designed to ensure emissions are controlled in all driving conditions, as well as requirements to employ diagnostic software
to identify and diagnose problems with emission control components, which if undiagnosed could lead to higher emissions.
This diagnostic software is called an on-board diagnostic system (“OBD”).

All global jurisdictions require manufacturers to conduct pre- and post-production vehicle testing to demonstrate
compliance with these emissions limits for the useful life of a vehicle as a prerequisite to obtaining emission compliance
certification before any vehicle can be sold.

These requirements become more challenging each year, especially in light of increased global scrutiny of diesel
emission control software calibration and we expect these emissions and certification requirements will continue to become
even more rigorous worldwide.

North America Region

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has established federal Tier 3 emissions standards, and federal

law allows the California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) to also establish its Low Emission Vehicle (“LEV”) II] emission

standards. The stringencies of these parallel federal and state emissions standards are generally aligned.

EPA and CARB both review manufacturers’ emission control software design as part of their emission certification
evaluation, whereas EPA has delegated to CARB to administer OBD software requirements.

44


--- Page 36 ---

In addition to its LEV III emissions standards, CARB regulations also require that a specified percentage of cars and
certain light-duty trucks sold in California qualify as zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles
or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. As part of a joint September 2019 rule (“SAFE | Rule”) NHTSA concluded that its corporate
average fuel economy standards preempt California’s GHG regulation and zero emission vehicle (“ZEV”) program. In
addition, EPA withdrew its waiver for California’s GHG and ZEV program. In December 2021, NHTSA published a rule that
repeals the NHTSA component of the Safe 1 Rule. In April 2021, EPA announced its intent to reconsider its withdrawal of
California’s waiver. However, it has not announced the outcome of its reconsideration. Expected to be issued in early to
mid-2022, EPA’s decision on California’s waiver likely will reinstate California’s legal right to have and enforce its GHG
and ZEV programs.

To the extent allowed by the existing waiver, federal law further allows other states to adopt CARB’s LEV III
criteria emission, GHG and ZEV standards. Thirteen other states currently enforce California’s LEV III standards in lieu of
the federal EPA standards, and ten states have also adopted California’s ZEV requirements.

Manufacturers must comply with EPA’s and CARB’s criteria emission standards at a vehicle-level as well as a
sales-weighted fleet level, whereas CARB’s ZEV requirements, to the extent enforceable, are fleet-only standards.

For a discussion of inquiries into our compliance with certain regulations in the U.S., see Note 26, Guarantees
granted, commitments and contingent liabilities within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report. See also “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which we Operate-Current and
future more stringent or incremental laws, regulations and governmental policies, including those regarding increased fuel
efficiency requirements and reduced greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions, have a significant effect on how we do business
and may increase our cost of compliance and negatively affect our operations and results.”

Enlarged Europe Region

In Europe, emissions are regulated by the European Commission (“EC”) and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (“UNECE”). The EC imposes standardized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27
EU member states, while non-EU countries bound by the “1958 UN Agreement” (an agreement concerning the adoption of
uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted or used on wheeled vehicles
and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions) apply regulations under
the UNECE framework. EU Member States can provide tax incentives for the purchase of vehicles that meet emission
standards earlier than the compliance date. As a result, vehicles must meet emission requirements and receive specific
approval from an appropriate Member State authority before they can be sold in any EU Member State. These regulatory
requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer in-use surveillance program.

Euro 6 emission levels are in effect for all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles and require additional
technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines compared to prior Euro 5 standards. These new technologies have
put additional cost pressures on the already challenging European market for small and mid-size diesel-powered vehicles.
Further requirements of Euro 6 have been developed by the EC and are effective for all new passenger cars and light
commercial vehicles. In addition to WLTP, the new RDE test procedure to directly assess the regulated emissions of light
duty vehicles under real driving conditions is effective. More stringent test requirements related to RDE, as well as
requirements relating to On-board Fuel and/or Energy Consumption Monitoring Device for Fuel Consumption Monitoring, is
effective for all new passenger cars registered after January 1, 2021 and all new light commercial vehicles registered after
January 1, 2022.

For a discussion of inquiries from relevant governmental agencies in the European Union, see Note 26, Guarantees
granted, commitments and contingent liabilities within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report. See also “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which we Operate-We remain
subject to diesel emissions investigations by several governmental agencies and to a number of related private lawsuits, as
well as other claims and lawsuits which may lead to further enforcement actions, penalties or damage awards and may also
adversely affect our reputation with consumers”

South America Region

Certain countries in South America follow U.S. procedures, standards and OBD requirements, while others follow
the European procedures, standards and onboard diagnostic requirements described below under Enlarged Europe Region. In
Brazil, vehicle emission standards are regulated by the Ministry of the Environment and have been in place since 1988 for
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The next phase of regulations (PROCONVE L7) aligned with fuel efficiency
and safety standards in January 2022 and a second step (PROCONVE L8) will come into effect in January 2025 with fleet
target limits (US BIN methodology) and real driving emission limits. Argentina has implemented regulations that mirror the
European Commission Euro 5 standards for all new vehicles. In Chile, implementation of Euro 6 standards is set for 2022.

China and India & Asia Pacific Region

China 6 standards were released in 2016 and are required nationwide beginning in January 2021 with China 6a
thresholds and by July 2023 with China 6b thresholds. China 6a and 6b have more stringent tailpipe emissions thresholds
than Euro 6, implement OBD requirements similar to U.S. OBD and evaporative emission control requirements, and add real
driving emissions (“RDE”) and U.S. onboard refueling vapor recovery requirements. Some regions within China
implemented China 6b in 2019 such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Chengdu,
Chongqing and Tianjin. Beijing implemented China 6b at the beginning of 2020.

South Korea implemented regulations that are similar to California’s LEV III regulations beginning in 2016 and
became fully required in 2019 for all gasoline vehicles. Diesel vehicles are required to meet Euro 6 EU emissions
requirements. Japan adopted the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Testing Procedures (“WLTP”) without Extra High
phase in 2018 for new models and for all models beginning January 2021. WLTP is a global harmonized standard for
regulating GHG emissions, non-GHG pollutants, and fuel or energy consumption for light-duty vehicles and electric range
for battery electric vehicles or hybrids.

India implemented nationwide Bharat Stage VI (“BSVI”) Emission norms (equivalent to Euro 6) in April 2020.
Stage 2 of BSVI norms (with more stringent OBD limits, RDE and an in-use performance ratio) will be implemented
beginning April 2023. The conformity Factor (CF) for RDE has not been confirmed but a two stage implementation for RDE
CF (Stage 1 in April 2023 and Stage 2 in April 2024) is under discussion. Currently E5 fuel is the reference fuel for BSVI,
and there is a plan to change the fuel to E20 in April 2025.

In addition, Australia is developing a revised Regulatory Impact Statement to introduce mandatory Euro 6 standards
beginning in 2027 while Euro 5 standards are expected to remain in force until that time.

Automotive Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
North America Region

In the U.S., since the enactment of the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has enforced minimum CAFE for fleets of new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold
in the U.S. for each model year. CAFE standards apply to all domestic and imported passenger car and light-duty truck fleets
and currently require year-over-year increases in fuel economy through 2025. The requirement is scaled based on vehicle
footprint size. The CAFE standards require that passenger cars imported into the U.S. from outside of North America are
averaged separately from those manufactured within North America, and domestic cars and light duty trucks are also
considered separately.

In 2012, EPA promulgated its first GHG rule under the federal Clean Air Act, which required manufacturers to
comply with a similar footprint-based GHG standard, the stringency of which also increases year-over-year through 2025.
The GHG rule does not require separate domestic passenger car compliance reporting but, like the CAFE program, light
trucks are reported separately from passenger cars. The U.S. issued EPA’s GHG standards and NHTSA’s CAFE fuel
economy standards as a joint rule, and in so doing, allowed CARB to enforce its own GHG rule, so long as CARB did not
apply a different standard of stringency to EPA’s GHG rule. The CAFE statute specifically preempts states from enforcing a
fuel economy rule.

46


--- Page 38 ---

In 2018 EPA and NHTSA were required to conduct a “mid-term review” to evaluate the appropriateness of model
year 2022-2025 CAFE/GHG standards (the stringency of which had been established in 2016) as well as the original market-
and technology cost consumer tolerance-based assumptions the agencies made as a basis for those standards. This review
concluded that those standards were inappropriate, which required the U.S. government to adopt a new Joint Rule with new
GHG and CAFE standards. In late 2018, California withdrew its commitment to the federal government that California would
enforce its GHG rule to the identical stringency of the prevailing federal rule.

In September 2019, EPA and NHTSA issued the first two parts of a new rule, which the agencies called the Safer
Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicle Rule (the “SAFE Rule”). SAFE Rule Part | established that due to the significant similarity
of the determination of any vehicle’s fuel economy and associated GHG emissions, the CAFE statute preempts California’s
GHG and ZEV programs. In a parallel determination, EPA withdrew its permission for California to enforce its own GHG
and ZEV programs.

In April 2020, EPA and NHTSA issued SAFE Part 2, which established new and much less stringent GHG and
CAFE standards.

In August and September 2021, EPA and NHTSA published proposed GHG and fuel economy regulations,
respectively. These regulations impose GHG and fuel economy standards that are stricter than the SAFE 2 Rule’s standards.
EPA published its final GHG regulation in December 2021, which includes stricter standards for model years 2023 through
2026. We expect NHTSA to publish its final rule in the coming months. In addition, EPA is expected to reinstate
California’s legal right to have and enforce its GHG and ZEV programs.

In a related rulemaking, in 2016, NHTSA increased the base rate of its CAFE penalty from $5.50 to $14.00, which
applies to each tenth of a mile per gallon (“MPG”) that a manufacturer’s fleet-wide average MPG is below the CAFE
standard multiplied by the number of vehicles in the manufacturer’s fleet to arrive at an aggregate penalty for that model
year. On January 14, 2021, NHTSA published an interim final rule with immediate effect, the result of which would be to
apply the increased fine rate that resulted from the Second Circuit’s ruling to future model years. In particular, NHTSA’s rule
imposes a CAFE penalty base rate of $5.50 through 2021 Model Year and increases the CAFE penalty base rate to $14.00
prospectively from the 2022 Model Year. Several non-governmental organizations and state attorneys general have initiated
litigation to overturn NHTSA’s interim final rule. On August 20, 2021, NHTSA published a supplemental notice of proposed
rulemaking, announcing that it was considering withdrawing its January 2021 interim final rule. If NHTSA withdraws the
rule, the CAFE penalty base rate would increase from $5.50 to $14.00 beginning in the 2019 Model Year. For more
information, refer to Note 26, Guarantees granted, commitments and contingent liabilities in the Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this report. For heavy duty vehicles (>8,500 pound gross vehicle weight rating), the GHG
and fuel consumption standard is utility based (payload and towing) and is increasing in stringency through 2027.

The Canadian and Mexican markets have adopted GHG standards derived from the U.S. government’s footprint-
based structure and generally align with its technology-adoption compliance approach.

In 2012, Mexico adopted a fleet average target of 155.1-199.5 grams of CO, per kilometer. The annual target is
based on the footprint of each vehicle and since 2012 the stringency of the annual target has increased annually and will do so
until 2025, when it will reach 85-116.7 grams of CO) per kilometer. The Mexican government has also made available CO,
credits for the use of efficient technologies, including electric vehicles, off-cycle technologies and efficient air conditioning
systems.

Enlarged Europe Region

Each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific sales-weighted fleet average target for CO) emissions as related
to vehicle weight. This regulation sets an industry fleet average target of 95 grams of CO, per kilometer starting in 2020 for
passenger cars (130g/km until 2019). In order to promote the sale of ultra-efficient vehicles, automobile manufacturers that
sell vehicles emitting less than 50 grams of CO) per kilometer earn additional CO; credits from 2020 to 2022. Furthermore,
automobile manufacturers that make use of innovative technologies, or eco-innovations, which improve real-world fuel
economy but may not show in the test cycles, such as solar panels or LED lighting, may gain an average credit for the
manufacturer's fleet of up to seven grams of CO) per kilometer.

The EU has also adopted standards for regulating CO, emissions from LCVs. This regulation requires that new light
commercial vehicles (“LCVs”) meet a fleet average CO) target of 147 grams of CO) per kilometer.

In April 2019, the Regulation (EU) 2019/631 which sets new CO, emissions targets starting from 2025 and 2030
was adopted and requires a 15 percent reduction from 2021 levels in 2025 (both passenger cars and LCV), a 37.5 percent
reduction for passenger cars and a 31 percent reduction for LCV in 2030 from 2021 levels.

WLTP entered into force in September 2018 for all registered passenger cars and in September 2019 for all
registered LCVs. WLTP is expected to provide CO), emissions and fuel consumption values that are more representative of
real driving conditions.

The quantity of CO, emissions in 2022 will be affected not only by market evolution (such as the expected reduction
of diesel market share), but also by the commercialization of low-emission and electrified vehicles.

Other countries in Enlarged Europe region outside of the EU perimeter, such as Switzerland, have introduced
specific regulations aimed to reduce vehicle CO) emissions or fuel consumption. The United Kingdom is continuing to follow
the EU GHG policy for cars and vans post-Brexit, but the regulation improvements are currently under discussion that will
address future regulatory changes.

South America Region

In July 2018, the first regulations related to the Rota 2030 Program were enacted in Brazil. Rota 2030 is a long-term
program (three cycles of five years each) that replaced the Inovar Auto Program and establishes mandatory requirements for
vehicle commercialization in Brazil: (a) adhesion to Vehicle Labeling Program; (b) commitment to achieve a minimum level
of energy efficiency; and (c) commitment to achieve a minimum level of structural performance and driver assistance
technologies. The regulation for the next phase of Energy Efficiency (CO, /fuel efficiency) beginning in 2022 incorporates
three fleets split into passenger, large SUV and light commercial vehicle categories. Among other things, the rule rewards the
improvement of sugar cane ethanol combustion efficiency and also recognizes and provides credit flexibilities for
technologies that provide benefits in conditions that are not seen on the standardized government test cycles.

In Argentina, although there is no current mandatory greenhouse gas requirement, the government is in the process
of implementing a comparative labeling based on the European statements (NEDC cycle) and legal text was published at the
end of 2021, to be implemented in the second quarter of 2022.

In Chile, a federal law was published to establish an energy efficiency program. The technical rules and targets
must be defined by February 2022 and must target implementation in February 2024 for light vehicles.

China Region

Beginning in 2021, China adopted WLTP for conventional and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and a unique Chinese
test cycle is applied to battery electric vehicles in the same year. The 2021-2025 Phase V Corporate Average Fuel
Consumption (“CAFC”) rules were released in 2019 by the Chinese government with increasing stringency reaching a target
of 4.6 liters per 100 kilometers by 2025. The dual credit management rule for 2021-2023 was released in 2020, and the
2024-2025 CAFC and New Energy Vehicle (“NEV”) Credits are expected to be issued at a later date.

NEVs consist of plug-in electric hybrids, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles, which generate positive
NEV credits, improve CAFC performance and provide a volume multiplier in the CAFC calculation, subject to meeting
certain criteria. Currently, off-cycle credit flexibilities in China are available in the areas of high efficiency air conditioning
and regenerative braking technologies, subject to meeting certain standards.

In June 2020, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released administrative rules regarding
CAFC and NEV credits that became effective in January 2021. Non-compliance with the CAFC target in these administrative
tules can be offset through carry-forward CAFC credits, transfer of CAFC credits within affiliates, the OEMs use of its own
NEV credits, or the purchase of NEV credits. Non-compliance with the NEV target can only be offset by the purchase of
NEV credits. The homologation of new products that exceed CAFC targets will be suspended for OEMs that are unable to
offset CAFC and/or NEV deficits until the deficits are offset.

India & Asia Pacific Region

Certain markets within the India & Asia Pacific region have enacted fuel consumption and GHG targets. For
example, India began enforcing phase I CAFC targets (CO) ~130gm/km @ 1037 kg) starting in April 2017 with more
stringent phase II CAFC targets (CO, ~113gm/km @ 1082 kg) beginning in April 2022.

South Korea implemented a phase II of CAFE/CO) standards beginning in 2016. Phase III, with more stringent
targets, became effective in January 2021. Japan implemented a new fuel economy standard in 2020 that switched from
vehicle weight class average to corporate average fuel economy. In Australia, although there is no mandatory GHG standard,
the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries member companies implemented a voluntary CO, target for light vehicles
starting in 2020.

Management of end-of-life products

In European markets, pursuant to the EU End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (2000/53/EC) (the “EU ELV Directive”), all
vehicle manufacturers are required to set up a take-back network with dismantling partners to collect the vehicles from their
last owners or holders when such vehicles have reached the end of their lives, and recycle them. The EU has decided to
review the EU ELV Directive. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Association des Constructeurs
Européens d’Automobiles) is currently focusing on defining country-specific best-practice processes for the treatment of
ELVs in order to ensure better environmental results.

Vehicle Safety
North America Region

Under U.S. federal law, all vehicles sold in the U.S. must comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
(“FMVSS”) promulgated by NHTSA, and must be certified by their manufacturer as being in compliance with all such
standards at the time of the first purchase of the vehicle. In addition, if a vehicle contains a defect that is related to motor
vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable FMVSS, the manufacturer must notify NHTSA and vehicle owners and
provide a remedy at no cost. Moreover, the TREAD Act authorized NHTSA to promulgate regulations requiring Early
Warning Reporting (“EWR”). EWR requires manufacturers to provide NHTSA several categories of information, including
all claims which involve one or more fatalities or injuries; all incidents of which the manufacturer receives actual notice
which involve fatalities or injuries alleged or proven to have been caused by a possible defect in such manufacturer’s motor
vehicle or motor vehicle equipment in the U.S.; and all claims involving one or more fatalities in a foreign country when the
possible defect is in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment that is identical or substantially similar to a motor vehicle or
motor vehicle equipment offered for sale in the U.S., as well as aggregate data on property damage claims from alleged
defects in a motor vehicle or in motor vehicle equipment; warranty claims; consumer complaints and field reports about
alleged or possible defects. The rules also require reporting of customer satisfaction campaigns, consumer advisories, recalls,
or other activity involving the repair or replacement of motor vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment, even if not safety
related.

NHTSA has secured a voluntary commitment from manufacturers to equip future vehicles with automatic electronic
braking systems. The commitment will make these braking systems standard on virtually all light-duty cars and trucks with a
gross vehicle weight of 8,500 pounds or less beginning no later than September 1, 2022 and on virtually all trucks with a
gross vehicle weight between 8,501 pounds and 10,000 pounds beginning no later than September 1, 2025.

In September 2019, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Inc. and the Association of Global Automakers, Inc.,
which have combined to form the Alliance for Automobile Innovation, announced a voluntary commitment from auto
manufacturers to introduce technology including a combination of auditory and visual alerts to remind parents and caregivers
to check the back seat upon leaving a vehicle to help address the risk of pediatric heatstroke in children left in cars. The
commitment is to install such technology in essentially all new cars and trucks by the 2025 model year or sooner.

At times, organizations like NHTSA or the U.S. Insurance Institute of Highway Safety issue or reissue safety ratings
applicable to vehicles. In October 2019, NHTSA announced a plan to propose significant updates and upgrades to its New
Car Assessment Program, also known as the Five-star Safety Ratings Program. The details are not known at this time, but are
expected to include new test dummies, changes to the mandatory label, new test procedures and evaluation of new
technologies. Depending on the content of the final changes, this set of changes could impact the market competitiveness of
the affected vehicles.

In January 2017, NHTSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) designed to enable vehicle-to-vehicle
communication technology. Rulemaking in this area has been inactive since then, and any additional costs that would have
been associated with the NPRM are deferred for the foreseeable future. However, NHTSA has engaged with industry to
confirm continued interest in facilitating the growth of this technology.

Furthermore, NHTSA has issued non-binding guidelines for addressing cybersecurity issues in the design and
manufacture of new motor vehicles, as well as guidance for the investigation and validation of cybersecurity measures.

In November 2020, voters in the State of Massachusetts passed a ballot initiative appearing to conflict with NHTSA
cybersecurity guidelines and may require manufacturers to disable or compromise some of the cybersecurity measures they
have put in place. The complete effects of this new law are still under review. In the meantime, the Alliance for Automation
Innovation, an industry association to which Stellantis belongs, has filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin enforcement of the new
law and the litigation is pending.

A new FMVSS requiring artificial sound in electric and hybrid electric vehicles took effect for new motor vehicles
built on or after March 1, 2021. The artificial sound is intended to provide audible notice of the presence of the electric or
hybrid electric vehicle to persons with impaired vision.

In January 2018, Mexico issued an amendment to the Consumers' Protection Law (“CPL”) regarding safety
regulations based on U.S. standards. The CPL, among other things, includes a deadline for vehicle manufacturers to provide
to the Federal Consumer Protection Agency (i) the launch date and a detailed description of every safety campaign applicable
to vehicles sold in Mexico, (ii) mandatory recall campaigns, based on international agencies' investigations and guidelines,
(iii) mandatory repurchase, repair or replacement (with a new vehicle model having the same characteristics) of vehicles that
risk the consumer's safety, health or life or threatens the consumer's personal financial condition, and (iv) mandatory product
withdrawal, when the Federal Consumer Protection Agency determines that the vehicle could risk the consumer's safety,
health or life or affect the consumer's personal financial condition. The rules of the CPL became effective in December 2019
and in addition to the rules mentioned above, the consumer may also be eligible for compensation related to a recall.

Enlarged Europe

Vehicles sold in Europe are subject to vehicle safety regulations established by the EU or, in very limited cases and
aspects, by individual Member States. In 2009, the EU established a uniform legal framework for vehicle safety, repealing
more than 50 then-existing directives and replacing them with a single regulation known as the “General Safety
Regulation” (“GSR”) aimed at incorporating relevant United Nations standards. The incorporation of United Nations
standards commenced in 2012. In 2014, discussions began in Europe for a comprehensive upgrade to the GSR;
implementation of the upgraded GSR for new vehicles and vehicle types will begin in 2022. The updated GSR will lead to
the implementation of a variable suite of passive and active safety technologies, depending on vehicle type and classification.
The significant items for the most common vehicles include, other than the manufacturer’s certification for the cybersecurity
features and related application on vehicles, mandatory features such as advanced emergency braking, intelligent speed
assistance, emergency lane keeping, driver drowsiness and attention warning, advanced driver distraction warning, reversing
detection, event data recorder, protection of pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users, and an expanded scope of
front and side crash testing. Also included are the introduction of autonomous vehicle provisions, such as a driver availability
monitoring system or vehicle platooning. Effective in September 2020, Regulation (EU) 2018/858 improved the current legal
framework for EU type-approval and, in particular, has introduced new provisions on market surveillance. This new regime
on market surveillance specifies the obligations of the economic operators in the automotive supply chain (manufacturers,
manufacturer’s representatives, importers and distributors), the responsibilities of the enforcement authorities in the Member
States, and the measures to be taken when vehicles and related components on the market appear to be affected by serious
safety or environmental risks. In addition, in-vehicle emergency call systems became mandatory for new type-approved
vehicles in the EU, Israel and Turkey markets in 2018. In Russia, a similar in-vehicle emergency call system became
mandatory in 2015.

South America Region

Vehicles sold in the South America region are subject to different vehicle safety regulations according to each
country, generally based on European and United Nations standards. Brazil published a draft of its 10-year safety regulatory
roadmap in 2017, providing a staged approach to implementation of new testing requirements and active safety technology.
More costly active safety technologies will be scheduled for implementation after 2024. In July 2018, the first regulation
related to Rota 2030 was enacted. Rota 2030 is a long-term program (three cycles of five years each) which includes
principles related to mandatory safety for all vehicles sold in Brazil. These regulations were approved by the Brazilian
Congress and sanctioned by the Brazilian President in December 2018 as well as ordinary regulations to address certain
minimum requirements and other metrics.

China and India & Asia Pacific Regions

Many countries in the China and India & Asia Pacific regions, including Australia, China, India, Japan and South
Korea have adopted their own new car assessment program and vehicle safety regulations. As UN ECE1958 agreement
countries, Australia, Japan and South Korea accept UN ECE safety requirements and are harmonizing their regulations with
UN ECE. The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement allows for the sale in Korea of U.S. vehicles that are manufactured in the
US.

Most of the Chinese vehicle safety regulations are equivalent to UN ECE, but China has unique electric vehicle
safety regulations and has developed a roadmap of the autonomous driving and connectivity regulations. China published the
Regulation for Administration of Recall of Defective Vehicles effective in 2013 and the Implementation Provisions on the
Regulation for Administration of Recall of Defective Vehicles effective in 2016. In 2019, State Administration for Market
Regulation in China issued a notice requiring close supervision of defects reporting and recall of new energy vehicles. China
issued rules on emission recalls effective as of July 1, 2021. Further, from early 2021, various authorities have issued
administrative rules on cybersecurity and software update of vehicles which impose stricter technical requirements than the
UN requirements.

India has implemented vehicle crash regulations effective in 2019 for all models and pedestrian protection regulations
effective in 2020 for all models. Provision of important safety features such as Airbag on Driver side, Vehicle Rear Parking
Alert system, Safety Belt reminder for Driver and Co-Driver side, Speed Alert System and Manual Override for Door latches
have been mandatory for all models beginning in June 2019. Further, Fitment of Airbag on Co-Driver side was made
mandatory effective December 2021. Rules for vehicle recalls were also implemented, effective April 2021. Also, brake and
electronic stability control system regulations will be aligned to EU regulations beginning in 2022 for all models.

In Korea, the amended Motor Vehicle Management Act (““MVMA”), which changed the overall recall procedures for
automobiles, while also imposing heightened obligations on vehicle manufacturers, took effect on February 5, 2021. The
amended MVMA increased the upper limit of administrative surcharges imposed for delayed recalls, to an amount three
times higher than the previous cap. In addition, under the amended MVMA, if a delayed recall causes harm to a person’s life,
body or property, such person may file a claim for damages, including punitive damages of up to five times the amount of
actual damages. Under the amended MVMA, vehicle manufacturers are also subject to increased administrative and criminal
sanctions.

Industrial Environmental Control

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air
emissions, water discharges, waste management and related environmental effects, and environmental clean-up if waste
disposal was done outside of legal requirements. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund
remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal, or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain
circumstances, these laws impose liability for related damages to natural resources.

51


--- Page 43 ---

To best comply with these requirements, Stellantis imposes a self-governing environmental management system
(“EMS”) on its operations, which are designed to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of our manufacturing activities,
and conduct internal environmental audits at our facilities. This program formalizes our commitment to responsible
environmental management of our manufacturing methods and processes. At many of our facilities, we have adopted and are
certified under the EMS requirements set forth in the ISO 14001 standard (ISO is an international standard-setting
organization). For our facilities subject to EU environmental law, we have adopted EMAS (the European Eco-Management
and Audit Scheme), an EU regulation that entities can choose to voluntarily adopt; EMAS has both EMS and audit
requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of Stellantis manufacturing plants and other facilities had an ISO 14001
certified EMS in place.

Workplace Health and Safety

Stellantis implemented a self-governing occupational health and safety management system (“OHSMS”) on its
operations, which are designed to prevent or reduce the occupational injuries and incidents and conduct internal health and
safety audits at our facilities.

The goal of achieving zero accidents was formalized by internally-established OHSMS requirements, as well as
through the global adoption of the then-applicable Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (“OHSAS”) 18001
governing OHSMS standard. The International Organization for Standardization later adopted the OHSAS 18001 standard
into its more comprehensive ISO 45001. At December 31, 2021, approximately 70 of Stellantis’ manufacturing plants were
ISO 45001 certified.

Applicability of Banking Law and Regulation to Financial Services
Several of our finance companies are regulated as financial institutions in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

In Italy, FCA Bank S.p.A., an equity method joint venture, is subject to European Central Bank (“ECB”) and Bank of
Italy supervision. Within FCA Bank Group, two subsidiaries (the Austrian FCA Bank G.m.b.H. and the Portuguese FCA
Capital Portugal LF.LC., S.A.), are subject to the supervision of the ECB and of the local central banks. In Spain, FCA
Capital Espana EFC SA is subject to the supervision of the Bank of Spain. Certain other Stellantis subsidiaries are subject to
the supervision of the local Supervisory Financial or Banking Authority: Banco Fidis S.A. is subject to Brazilian Central
Bank supervision, FCA Compaijiia Financiera S.A., incorporated in Argentina, is subject to Argentinian Central Bank
supervision and FCA Automotive Finance Co., Ltd, is subject to the supervision of the Chinese Banking and Insurance
Regulatory Commission and People’s Bank of China.

In France, Banque PSA Finance S.A., a wholly owned consolidated entity, is subject to the supervision of the French
local supervisory banking authority (ACPR), and Compagnie pour la location de véhicules S.A.(CLV), Crédipar, PSA
Banque France S.A. and Opel Bank S.A. are subject to the supervision of ECB and the ACPR. In Germany, PSA Bank
Deutschland GmbH is subject to the supervision of the ECB and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). In
Italy, Banca PSA Italia S.p.A. is subject to ECB and Bank of Italy supervision. In Spain, PSA Financial Services Spain EFC
SA is subject to the supervision of the Bank of Spain. Banco PSA Finance Brasil S.A. is subject to Brazilian Central Bank
supervision. Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Auto Finance Company Ltd and Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Financial Leasing are
subject to the supervision of the Chinese Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and People’s Bank of China. With
the exception of Banque PSA Finance S.A, all of the above entities are joint ventures accounted by equity method.

In November 2021, Stellantis acquired a financial services company which conducts sales finance and consumer
lending activities in the U.S. market under the supervision of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and various
state regulatory agencies.

As a result of the regulation described above, these companies are, in certain circumstances, subject to requirements

in a wide range of areas including solvency, capital, reporting, customer protection and account administration, among other
matters.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the
information included under “ STELLANTIS OVERVIEW “and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties relating to
Stellantis, including, but not limited to, those described under ‘Cautionary Statements Concerning Forward Looking
Statements” and “Risk Factors”. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking
statements.

Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities
The trends, uncertainties and opportunities facing Stellantis are summarized below:

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operations have been, and continue to be, affected by the recent and
ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In
response to the pandemic, many governments in affected jurisdictions have imposed travel bans, quarantines, lockdowns and
other emergency public safety measures including closures of businesses.

The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in disruptions in our manufacturing operations and our supply chain, lower
capacity utilization, shutdowns at our facilities as well as unfavorable working capital movements (for example because
under our supply terms, during periods when our facilities were shutdown, we were required to pay suppliers for components
purchased in an earlier high volume environment), with an adverse impact on our results.

Given the dynamic nature of the outbreak, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition in the future remains highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time. New
strains of the virus continue to cause concern regarding the ability of vaccines to slow the pandemic and, relatedly,
governments continue to impose restrictions. With or without government restrictions, we might also experience supply
chain dysfunction, increased absenteeism in our production facilities and reduced demand for our products.

Impact of Unfilled Semiconductor Orders. Our operations have been, and continue to be, affected by a significant
semiconductor supply shortage as a result of unfilled orders that began in 2020, and increased chip delivery lead times, which
has resulted in reduced vehicle production volumes, and increased costs to source available semiconductors. Our overall
vehicle shipment volumes in 2021 were significantly impacted by unfulfilled semiconductor orders, representing a loss of
approximately 20 percent of our planned production. We expect that this trend will continue throughout 2022. To the extent
this unavailability of semiconductor chips continues or worsens, and we are unable to mitigate its effects, our ability to
deliver planned quantities of our vehicles will continue to be adversely affected.

Shipments and Sales. Vehicle shipments are generally driven by expectations of consumer demand for vehicles,
which is affected by economic conditions, availability and cost of dealer and customer financing and incentives offered to
retail customers, as discussed further below.

In our financial information presented in this report, we recognized revenue at the same time as the transfer of
control of goods sold. For new vehicles, this transfer generally corresponds to the date when the vehicles were made available
to independent dealers or, in the case of direct sales to end-customers through owned dealers, the delivery date of the vehicle
to end-customers.

Product Development and Technology. A key driver of consumer demand, and therefore our performance, is the
continued refresh, renewal and evolution of our vehicle portfolio, and we have announced commitments of significant capital
and resources toward the introduction of new vehicle platforms and new software technologies. In order to realize a return on
the significant investments we intend to make and to achieve competitive operating margins, we will have to continue
significant investment in new vehicle launches. We believe past efforts in developing common vehicle platforms and
powertrains have accelerated the time-to-market for many of our vehicle launches and over time resulted in cost savings. We
expect this positive trend to accelerate as a result of the merger and ongoing integration, as well as our announced plans to
converge on four vehicle platforms for future vehicle launches. However, achieving the benefits of integration and
particularly the convergence of platforms will require significant investments over the medium term.

53


--- Page 45 ---

The costs associated with product development, vehicle improvements and launches, impact our Net profit. In
addition, our ability to continue to make the necessary investments in product development, and recover the related costs,
depends in large part on the market acceptance and success of the new or significantly refreshed vehicles we introduce. New
launches are supported by marketing and profitability studies carried out several years prior to their actual launch, which
increases the risk of not meeting customer preferences, resulting in lower volumes than forecasted or selling at lower prices
and impacting profitability.

The research and development expenses presented in the financial information in this report include the cost of
scientific and technical activities, intellectual property rights, and the education and training necessary for the development,
production or implementation and marketing of new or substantially improved materials, methods, products, processes,
systems or services. Development expenditures were recognized as an intangible asset if we could demonstrate (i) our
intention to complete the intangible asset as well as the availability of technical, financial and other resources for this
purpose; (ii) that it was probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the development expenditure will flow to
the entity; and (iii) that the cost of the asset could be measured reliably. Capitalized development expenditures included
related borrowing costs.

Future developments in our product portfolio could lead to significant capitalization of development assets and
thereafter amortization of such assets. Our time to market is approximately 24 months, but varies depending on the specific
product, from the date the design is signed-off for tooling and production, after which the product goes into production,
resulting in an increase in amortization. Therefore, our operating results are impacted by the cyclicality of our research and
development expenditures based on our product plans and our ability to bring projects timely into production.

In order to meet expected changes in consumer demand and regulatory requirements, we intend to invest significant
resources in product development and research and development. New markets for alternative fuel source vehicles and
autonomous vehicles are also continuing to emerge and we expect both to invest resources in these areas and to optimize our
R&D investments as a result of the progressive integration of the former FCA and PSA businesses.

Vehicle Profitability. Our results of operations reflect the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which tends to vary
based upon a number of factors, including vehicle size and model, the content of those vehicles, brand positioning, and the
mix of internal-combustion, electric and hybrid engines. Vehicle profitability also depends on sales prices to dealers and fleet
customers, net of sales incentives, costs of materials and components, as well as transportation and warranty costs.

Our larger vehicles, such as UVs and pickup trucks, have historically been more profitable on a per vehicle basis
than smaller vehicles. In recent years, consumer preferences for certain larger vehicles, such as SUVs, have increased;
however, there is no guarantee this trend will continue.

Newly introduced internal-combustion models are generally more profitable than older models, and vehicles
equipped with additional options are generally more profitable than those with fewer options. As a result, our ability to offer
attractive vehicle options and upgrades is critical to our ability to increase our profitability on these vehicles. In addition, in
the U.S. and Europe, our vehicle sales to dealers for sale to their retail consumers are normally more profitable than our fleet
sales, in part because the retail consumers are more likely to prefer additional optional features while fleet customers
increasingly tend to concentrate purchases on smaller vehicles with fewer optional features, which have historically had a
lower profitability per unit.

Vehicles sold under certain brand and model names are generally more profitable when there is strong brand
recognition of those vehicles. In some cases this is tied to a long history of the brands and models, and in other cases to
customers identifying these vehicles as being more attractive and responsive to customer needs.

In addition, against a backdrop of significant technological development, changing consumer patterns and new
competitive forces, the cost of complying with tightening regulatory requirements could negatively impact our profitability.
Vehicle models that are equipped with BEV or PHEV powertrains tend to be less profitable than those equipped with
internal-combustion engines, with the significant costs of batteries largely accounting for this differential. Although battery
prices are expected to gradually decline in the coming years and are partially offset in some cases by governmental subsidies
and tax exemptions, we expect that in the near term the profitability of vehicles equipped with electric or PHEV engines will
continue to lag behind those equipped with internal-combustion engines.

Pricing. The automotive industry has historically experienced intense price competition resulting from the variety of
available competitive vehicles and excess global manufacturing capacity. Manufacturers have typically promoted products by
offering dealer, retail and fleet incentives, including cash rebates, option package discounts, and subsidized financing or
leasing programs, leading to increased price pressure and sharpened competition within the industry. We plan to continue to
use such incentives to price vehicles competitively and to manage demand and support inventory management profitability.

Production costs. Production costs include purchases (including costs related to the purchase of components and raw
materials), labor costs, depreciation, amortization, logistic and product warranty and recall campaign costs. We purchase a
variety of components, raw materials, supplies, utilities, logistics and other services from numerous suppliers. Fluctuations in
production costs are primarily related to the number of vehicles we produce and sell along with shifts in vehicle mix, as
newer models of vehicles generally have more technologically advanced components and enhancements and therefore higher
costs per unit.

Production costs may also be affected by fluctuations in raw material prices. For example, some of the batteries
integrated in our electric and hybrid models integrate rare raw materials, which are exposed to heightened shortage risks and
potentially rising procurement costs. The cost of raw materials has historically comprised 10-20 percent of our total purchases
described above, while the remaining 80-90 percent of our total purchases is made of components, conversion of raw
materials and overhead costs. In 2021, we experienced an increase in the cost of raw materials of approximately €2.2 billion.
To the extent the cost of raw materials continues to increase as a result of inflationary pressures, and we are unable to
mitigate its effects, our future profitability could be impacted.

We typically seek to manage these costs and minimize their volatility by using fixed price purchase contracts,
commercial negotiations and technical efficiencies.

Despite our efforts, our production costs related to raw materials and components have increased as a result of tariffs
introduced in recent years; uncertainty related to tariffs and trade policy in our larger markets including the U.S., the
European Union and China has made it more difficult to predict our raw material and components costs. Our production costs
have also increased as we have significantly enhanced the content of our vehicles as we renew and refresh our product
offerings. Over time, technological advancements and improved material sourcing may reduce the cost to us of the additional
enhancements. In addition, we seek to recover higher costs through pricing actions, but even when market conditions permit
this, there may be a time lag between the increase in our costs and our ability to realize improved pricing. Accordingly, our
results are typically adversely affected, at least in the short term, until price increases are accepted in the market.

Further, in many markets where our vehicles are sold, we are required to pay import duties on those vehicles, which
are included in production costs. We reflect these costs in the price charged to our customers to the extent market conditions
permit. However, for many of our vehicles, particularly in the mass-market vehicle segments, we cannot always pass along
increases in those duties to our dealers and distributors and remain competitive. Our ability to price our vehicles to recover
those increased costs has affected, and will continue to affect, our profitability.

Economic Conditions. Demand for new vehicles tends to reflect economic conditions in the various markets in
which we operate because retail sales depend on individual purchasing decisions, which in turn are affected by many factors
including inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence, and levels of disposable income. Fleet sales and sales of light
commercial vehicles are also influenced by economic conditions, which drive vehicle utilization and investment activity.
Further, demand for light commercial vehicles and pickup trucks is driven, in part, by construction and infrastructure
projects. Therefore, our performance is directly correlated with the macroeconomic trends in the markets in which we
operate.

Regulation. We are subject to a complex set of regulatory regimes throughout the world in which vehicle safety,
emissions and fuel economy regulations have become increasingly stringent and the related enforcement regimes increasingly
active. These developments may affect our vehicle sales as well as our profitability and reputation. We are subject to
applicable national and local regulations with which we must comply in order to continue operations in every market,
including a number of markets in which we derive substantial revenue. Developing, engineering and manufacturing vehicles
that meet these requirements and therefore may be sold in those markets requires a significant expenditure of management
time and financial resources.

We expect that, as a result of the continued integration of the former FCA and PSA businesses and our announced
plans to converge on four platforms for future vehicle launches, we will be able to deploy electrification technologies and
CO), abating technologies across our range of brands in a shorter timeframe and react more quickly to changes in regulation,
with anticipated savings in the compliance effort. However, these costs and the costs incurred to meet other regulatory
requirements may be difficult to pass through to customers, so the increased costs may affect our results of operations and
profitability.

Further, developments in regulatory requirements in China, the largest single market in the world in 2021, limit in
some respects, the product offerings we can pursue as we expand the scope of our operations in that country. Refer to “Risk
Factors-Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate- Current and more stringent future or
incremental laws, regulations and governmental policies, including those regarding increased fuel efficiency requirements
and reduced greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions, have a significant effect on how we do business and may increase our
cost of compliance, result in additional liabilities and negatively affect our operations and results.” for more information.

In addition, regulatory requirements in relation to CO, emissions from vehicles, such as the Corporate Average Fuel
Efficiency (CAFE) standards in the U.S., are increasingly stringent. In August 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit vacated a final rule published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) in July
2019 that had reversed NHTSA’s 2016 increase to the base rate of the CAFE penalty from $5.50 to $14.00. The base rate
applies to each tenth of a mile per gallon (“MPG”) that a manufacturer’s fleet-wide average MPG is below the CAFE
standard, and is multiplied by the number of vehicles in the manufacturer’s fleet to arrive at an aggregate penalty. In January
2021, NHTSA published an interim final rule with immediate effect, the result of which would be to apply the increased fine
rate that resulted from the Second Circuit’s ruling to future model years. In particular, NHTSA’s rule imposes a CAFE
penalty base rate of $5.50 through 2021 Model Year and increases the CAFE penalty base rate to $14.00 prospectively from
the 2022 Model Year. Several non-governmental organizations and state attorneys general have initiated litigation to overturn
NHTSA’s interim final rule. In August 2021, NHTSA published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, announcing
that it was considering withdrawing its January 2021 interim final rule. If NHTSA withdraws the rule, the CAFE penalty
base rate would increase from $5.50 to $14.00 beginning in the 2019 Model Year.

Merger integration. The combination of FCA and PSA was completed on January 17, 2021. The merger was
implemented by way of a legal cross-border merger of PSA with and into FCA. The merger has been accounted for using the
acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, with PSA being identified as the
acquirer for accounting purposes.

We expect that the continued integration of the FCA and PSA businesses will foster our innovation capability and
further drive development in new energy vehicles, sustainable mobility, autonomous driving and connectivity. The
integration process started immediately after the merger, and we expect that it will allow us to achieve savings, gains and
synergies in several areas, including technology, platforms and products, procurement, selling, general and administrative
expenses, logistics and other functions, and that such synergies will result in improved profitability. The integration process
involves inherent costs which have impacted and will continue to impact our results in the near term, although we expect that
those costs will be more than offset by the positive effects of the integration. Challenges in the integration process may arise
and the anticipated benefits of the integration may take longer than expected to be realized or not be realized at all.

Tariffs and Trade Policy. There has been a recent and significant increase in activity and speculation regarding
tariffs and duties between governments in various regions, in particular the United States and its trading partners, China and
the European Union, as well as between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Tariffs or duties may reduce
consumer demand and/or make our products less profitable. In addition, the availability and price at which we are able to
source components and raw materials globally may be adversely affected. New customs procedures between the European
Union and the United Kingdom, including full import controls for goods being imported from the European Union to the
United Kingdom that are expected to be gradually introduced by the United Kingdom throughout 2022, could also increase
our costs of manufacturing in the United Kingdom or importing vehicles to the United Kingdom that are manufactured in the
European Union, which may make our products less profitable in the United Kingdom.

Dealer and Customer Financing. Given that a large percentage of the vehicles we sell to dealers and retail customers
worldwide are financed, the availability and cost of financing is a significant factor affecting our vehicle shipment volumes
and Net revenues. Availability of customer financing could affect the vehicle mix, as customers who have access to greater
financing are able to purchase higher priced vehicles, whereas when customer financing is constrained, vehicle mix could
shift towards less expensive vehicles. The low interest rate environment in recent years has had the effect of reducing the
effective cost of vehicle ownership. While interest rates in the U.S. and Europe have been at historically low levels, the
availability and terms of financing will likely continue to change over time, impacting our results, and if recent and ongoing
increases in inflation in key markets persist, there could be an increase in the cost of borrowing and the availability of
affordable credit for vehicle financing.

Effects of Foreign Exchange Rates. We are affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (i) through translation
of foreign currency financial statements into Euro for consolidation, which we refer to as the translation impact, and (ii)
through transactions by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their own functional currencies, which we refer to as the
transaction impact. Given our presence in numerous countries outside the Eurozone, a strengthening of foreign currencies (in
particular of the U.S. Dollar, given the size of our U.S. operations) against the Euro generally would have a positive effect on
our financial results, which are reported in Euro, and on our operations in relation to sales in those countries of vehicles and
components produced in Europe. Foreign exchange rates, including the U.S. Dollar/Euro exchange rate, have fluctuated
significantly in 2021, and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, a significant portion of our operating cash flow is
expected to be generated in U.S. Dollars and, although a portion of our debt is denominated in U.S. Dollars, the majority of
our indebtedness is denominated in Euro. Given the mix of our debt and liquidity, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the
Euro generally would have a positive impact on our net cash position.

In order to reduce the impacts of foreign exchange rates, we historically hedged a percentage of certain exposures.

Shipment Information

As discussed in STELLANTIS OVERVIEW—Overview of Our Business, our activities were carried out through six
reportable segments: five regional reportable vehicle segments North America, South America, Enlarged Europe, Middle
East & Africa, and China and India & Asia Pacific) and the Maserati global luxury brand segment. The following table sets
forth vehicle shipment information by segment. Vehicle shipments are generally aligned with current period production
which is driven by plans to meet consumer demand. Revenue is recognized when control of our vehicles, services or parts has
been transferred and the Company’s performance obligations to customers has been satisfied. The Company has determined
that our customers from the sale of vehicles and service parts are generally dealers, distributors, fleet customers or directly to
retail customers. Transfer of control, and therefore revenue recognition, generally correspond to the date when the vehicles or
service parts were made available to the customer, or when the vehicles or service parts were released to the carrier
responsible for transporting them to the customer. New vehicle sales with guaranteed residual value guarantees provided by
the Company are recognized as revenue when control of the vehicle transferred to the customer, except in situations where
the Company issued a put option for which there is a significant economic incentive to exercise. The Company also sold
vehicles where, the contract included a put option whereby the customer could require the Company to repurchase the
vehicles. For these types of arrangements, the Company assessed whether a significant economic incentive did not exist for
the customer to exercise its put option, then revenue was recognized when control of the vehicle transferred to the fleet
customer. Refer to Note 2, Basis of preparation, within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report for further details on our revenue recognition policy.

For a description of our dealers and distributors see STELLANTIS OVERVIEW—Sales Overview. Accordingly, the

number of vehicles sold does not necessarily correspond to the number of vehicles shipped for which revenues were recorded
in any given period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We monitor our operations through the use of several non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”)
financial measures: Adjusted operating income, Industrial free cash flows and Industrial net financial position. We believe
that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding our operating results and enhance
the overall ability to assess our financial performance. They provide us with comparable measures which facilitate
management’s ability to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations
and other operational decisions. These and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which we operate, however,
these financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not intended to
be substitutes for measures of financial performance as prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), as well as IFRS as adopted by the
European Union.

Adjusted operating income: Adjusted operating income/(loss) excludes from Net profit/(loss) from continuing
operations adjustments comprising restructuring, impairments, asset write-offs, disposals of investments and unusual
operating income/(expense) that are considered rare or discrete events and are infrequent in nature, as inclusion of such items
is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance, and also excludes Net financial
expenses/(income), Tax expense/(benefit) and Share of the profit/(loss) of equity method investees.

Unusual operating income/(expense) are impacts from strategic decisions as well as events considered rare or
discrete and infrequent in nature, as inclusion of such items is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing
operating performance. Unusual operating income/(expense) includes, but may not be limited to:

+ Impacts from strategic decisions to rationalize Stellantis’ core operations,

+  Facility-related costs stemming from Stellantis’ plans to match production capacity and cost structure to market
demand, and

+ Convergence and integration costs directly related to significant acquisitions or mergers.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, Pro Forma Adjusted operating income includes the Adjusted operating
income of FCA for the period January | - January 16, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Pro Forma Adjusted
operating income includes the Adjusted operating income result of FCA for the period January 1 - December 31, 2020.

Adjusted operating income is used for internal reporting to assess performance and as part of the Company's
forecasting, budgeting and decision making processes as it provides additional transparency to the Company's core
operations. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful because it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of
the Company’s ongoing operating performance and allows management to view operating trends, perform analytical
comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among our segments. We also believe that Adjusted operating
income is useful for analysts and investors to understand how management assesses the Company’s ongoing operating
performance on a consistent basis. In addition, Adjusted operating income is one of the metrics used in the determination of
the annual performance bonus for the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and other eligible employees, including
members of the Top Executive Team.

Refer to the sections Company Results and Results by Segment below for further discussion and for a reconciliation
of this non-GAAP measure to Net profit from continuing operations, which is the most directly comparable measure included
in our Consolidated Income Statement. Adjusted operating income should not be considered as a substitute for Net profit
from continuing operations, cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under IFRS.

Industrial free cash flows: is our key cash flow metric and is calculated as Cash flows from operating activities less:
cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations; cash flows from operating activities related to financial
services, net of eliminations; investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities,
contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investments;
adjusted for: net intercompany payments between continuing operations and discontinued operations, proceeds from disposal
of assets and contributions to defined benefit pension plans, net of tax. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Pro Forma
Industrial free cash flows include the Industrial free cash flows of FCA for the period January | - January 16, 2021. The
timing of Industrial free cash flows may be affected by the timing of monetization of receivables and the payment of accounts
payables, as well as changes in other components of working capital, which can vary from period to period due to, among
other things, cash management initiatives and other factors, some of which may be outside of the Company’s control. In
addition, Industrial free cash flows is one of the metrics used in the determination of the annual performance bonus for the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company and other eligible employees, including members of the Top Executive Team.

Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources —Industrial free cash flows for further information and the reconciliation
of this non-GAAP measure to Cash flows from operating activities, which is the most directly comparable measure included
in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Industrial free cash flows should not be considered as a substitute for Net
profit from continuing operations, cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under IFRS.

Industrial net financial position is calculated as: Debt plus derivative financial liabilities related to industrial
activities less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial securities that are considered liquid, (iii) current financial
receivables from the Company or its jointly controlled financial services entities and (iv) derivative financial assets and
collateral deposits; therefore, debt, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets/liabilities pertaining to Stellantis’
financial services entities are excluded from the computation of the Industrial net financial position. Industrial net financial
position includes the Industrial net financial position classified as held for sale. We believe Industrial net financial position is
useful in providing a measure of the Company’s net cash, considering cash and cash equivalents and financial securities. Due
to different sources of cash flows used for the repayment of the financial debt between industrial activities and financial
services (by cash from operations for industrial activities and by collection of financial receivables for financial services) and
the different business structure and leverage implications, we provide a separate analysis of Net financial position between
industrial activities and financial services. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources —Industrial net financial position for
further information.

Cost of revenues includes purchases (including commodity and components costs), labor costs, depreciation,
amortization, logistics cost, product warranty and recall campaign costs.

The increase in Cost of revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to the impact of the merger, with
Cost of revenues of approximately €80.1 billion relating to the operations of FCA.

The increase in Pro Forma Cost of revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to improved vehicle
line mix and cost inflation across all segments and higher volumes in South America, partially offset by translation exchange
impacts, primarily in North America. Additionally, in 2021 Cost of revenues includes €732 million for the change in estimate
in warranty costs incurred after the contractual warranty period (refer to Note 21, Provision, within the Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information) and €522 million of reversal of fair value
adjustment recognized in purchase accounting on FCA inventory. In 2020 Cost of revenues included approximately €450
million of impairment charges of which €410 million related to FCA.

The decrease in Cost of revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily a result of lower volumes, mainly due to
the temporary suspension of production and demand disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The increase in Selling, general and other costs in 2021 as compared with 2020 primarily related to the impact of the
merger, with Selling, general and other costs of approximately €5.0 billion relating to the operations of the former FCA.

The Pro Forma Selling, general and other costs in 2021 were largely in line with 2020, with higher marketing

expense in North America and South America to support launches of new products being offset mainly by lower advertising
spending in Enlarged Europe.

--- Page 54 ---

The decrease in Selling, general and other costs in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a significant
reduction in selling expenses and cost-cutting initiatives with respect to general and administrative expenses in response to

the COVID-19 pandemic.

relating to the operations of FCA.

On a Pro Forma basis Research and development expenditures expensed in 2021 were in line with 2020. Temporary
cost cutting measures implemented in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased research and development
activity in connection with the acceleration of electrification and other initiatives in 2021 were substantially offset by the

realization of synergies.

The decrease in Research and development expenditures expensed during the year ended December 31, 2020

Impairments and write-off in Pro Forma capitalized development expenditures for 2020 included €503 million in
former FCA primarily as a result of (i) reduced volume expectations within the Enlarged Europe, South America and
Maserati segments, (ii) increase in the CAFE fine rate applicable starting with model year 2022 in the North America
segment and (iii) the decisions that were made regarding the planned utilization of certain assembly assets in the Maserati
segment. Impairment charges of €151 million in 2021 include primarily the impairment of certain legacy vehicle platforms in

The Company conducts research and development for new vehicles and technology to improve the performance,
safety, fuel efficiency, reliability, consumer perception and environmental impact of its vehicles. Research and development
costs consist primarily of material costs, services and personnel related expenses that support the development of new and
existing vehicles with powertrain technologies. For further details of research and development costs, see Trends,
Uncertainties and Opportunities—Product Development and Technology and Overview of Our Business - Research and
Development.

The increase in total Research and development expenditures in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily related to the
impact of the merger, with total Research and development expenditures of approximately €3.5 billion relating to the
operations of the former FCA.

Total Pro Forma Research and development expenditures in 2021 decreased compared with 2020 with temporary
cost cutting measures implemented in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased research and development
activity in connection with the acceleration of electrification and other initiatives in 2021 more than offset by the realization
of synergies.

The decrease in total Research and development expenditures in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily the result
of cost containment initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to research and development support

functions.

The increase in restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 relates was mainly
in Enlarged Europe as part of the integration and optimization of the operations.

The decrease in restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily
driven by significant decrease in termination costs for employees.

€ 734 € 94 124 Net financial expenses € 746 € 672 11.0 %

The increase in Net financial expenses in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily related to the impact of the merger, with
Net financial expenses of approximately €554 million relating to the operations of FCA. For the year ended December 31,
2020, Interest income and other financial income include a benefit of €57 million resulting from the remeasurement of the
financial liability recognized upon the commitment to repurchase 30.7 million Groupe PSA shares from Dongfeng Group in
the context of the merger with FCA. Refer to Note 6 - Net financial expenses and Note 27 - Equity within the Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

The increase in Pro Forma Net financial expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to the financial income
of €57 million recognized in 2020 as explained above. Excluding this gain, Net financial expenses were substantially in line

compared to 2020.

The decrease in Net financial expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the benefit of €57 million
recognized in 2020 resulting from the remeasurement of the financial liability described above.

13.3 % 17.3 % 15.5 % _ Effective tax rate 13.3 % 30.8 % -1,750 bps

The Pro Forma effective tax rate was 13.3 percent and 30.8 percent for the years ended December 31, 2021, and
2020, respectively. The change in the Pro Forma effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the
corresponding period in 2020, was primarily due to the €1.4 billion net tax benefit recognized during 2021 related to
recognition and utilization of previously unrecognized Deferred tax assets, primarily in France and Germany.

The effective tax rate was 13.3 percent and 17.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020,
respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the corresponding
period in 2020, was primarily related to €1.4 billion net tax benefit related to recognition and utilization of previously
unrecognized Deferred tax assets, primarily in France and Germany, offset partially by the unfavorable effective tax rate
impact of the inclusion of North America, as well as the current year unrecognized deferred tax assets, primarily in Italy and
Brazil.

During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the first Stellantis business plan was prepared, which provided
sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant portion of additional deferred tax assets should be recognized,
primarily in France and Germany, as discussed above.

The effective tax rate was 17.3 percent and 15.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019,
respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to a decrease in current
year deferred tax asset recognition, as well as a decrease in the France statutory tax rate, resulting in a reduced tax benefit for
foreign rate differential.

The change in the Share of the profit of equity method investees in 2021 compared to 2020, is primarily attributable
to (i) reduced losses from PSA joint ventures in China for €445 million, (ii) improved results from PSA financial services
joint ventures for €68 million and (iii) the impact of the merger, with the Share of the profit of equity method investees of
€317 million relating to the operations of FCA.

The increase in the Pro Forma Share of the profit of equity method investees in 2021 compared to 2020, was
primarily due to reduced losses from the joint ventures in China for €515 million and improvement in the results from

financial services joint ventures.

The decrease in the Share of the profit of equity method investees in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to
higher losses in joint ventures in China.

the merger, with Net profit from continuing operations of approximately €9.0 billion relating to the operations of FCA.

The increase in Pro Forma Net profit from continuing operations in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily related to
the improved operating performance and higher Share of the profit of equity method investees partially offset by increased

net financial and tax expense.

The decrease in the Net profit from continuing operations in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to lower
operating performance due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The increase in North America shipments in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the contribution of FCA
operations following the merger.

The decrease in North America Pro Forma shipments in 2021 compared to 2020 was mainly due to discontinuation
of Dodge Grand Caravan and Journey in the last six months of 2020, partially offset by 2021 Jeep and Wagoneer white-space
launches, as well as higher Ram pickup volumes.

The North America shipments in 2020 were slightly down as compared to 2019.
Net revenues

The increase in North America Net revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 was almost entirely due to the contribution
of FCA operations following the merger.

The increase in Middle East & Africa Net revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the

contribution of FCA operations following the merger.

The increase in Middle East & Africa Pro Forma Net revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 was mainly driven by
higher net pricing, including pricing actions for Turkish lira devaluation, and increased volumes, partially offset by negative

foreign exchange translation, mainly from Turkish lira.

The increase in Middle East & Africa Net revenue in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to higher

volumes in Turkey and Egypt.

We locally produce and distribute the Jeep Cherokee, Compass, Grand Commander and Commander PHEV through
the 50% owned GAC FCA JV. In January 2022, we announced a plan to increase our shareholding with GAC FCA JV from
50 percent to 75 percent, subject to the approval of the Chinese government.

We also locally manufacture vehicles under the Dongfeng Peugeot and Dongfeng Citroén brands in China through
the 50% owned DPCA JV, based in Wuhan, China. DPCS markets the vehicles produced by DPCA in China. The results of
these joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, with recognition of our share of the net income of the joint
venture in the line item “Share of the profit/(loss) of equity method investees” within the Consolidated Income Statement. We
also produce the Jeep Compass through our joint operation with FIAPL and we recognize our related interest in the joint
operation on a line by line basis. Until June 2020, vehicles under the DS brand have been manufactured and marketed in
China through CAPSA a 50% joint venture between PSA and the Changan group. Upon the sale of the 50 percent stake by
PSA in June 2020, Shenzhen Baoneng Motor Co. Ltd will continue to manufacture DS vehicles for the Company.

Shipments distributed by our consolidated subsidiaries, which include vehicles produced by FIAPL, are reported in
both consolidated and combined shipments. Shipments of the GAC FCA JV and DPCA JV are not included in consolidated
shipments and are only in combined shipments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Overview

We require significant liquidity in order to meet our obligations and fund the business. Short-term liquidity is
required to purchase raw materials, parts and components for vehicle production, as well as to fund selling, administrative,
research and development, and other expenses. In addition to our general working capital and operational needs, we expect to
use significant amounts of cash for the following purposes: (i) capital expenditures to support our existing and future
products, (ii) principal and interest payments under our financial obligations and (iii) pension and employee benefit
payments. We make capital investments in the regions in which we operate primarily related to initiatives to introduce new
products, including for electrification and autonomous driving, enhance manufacturing efficiency, improve capacity and for
maintenance, and for regulatory and environmental compliance.

Our business and results of operations depended on our ability to achieve certain minimum vehicle shipment
volumes. As is typical for an automotive manufacturer, we have significant fixed costs and, as such, changes in our vehicle
shipment volumes could have a significant effect on profitability and liquidity. We generally receive payment from dealers
and distributors shortly after shipment, whereas there is a lag between the time we receive parts and materials from our
suppliers and the time we are require to pay for them. Therefore, during periods of increasing vehicle shipments, there is
generally a corresponding positive impact on the Company’s cash flow and liquidity. Conversely, during periods in which
vehicle shipments decline, there is generally a corresponding negative impact on the Company’s cash flow and liquidity.
Delays in shipments of vehicles, including delays in shipments in order to address quality issues or components shortage,
tend to negatively affect the Company’s cash flow and liquidity. In addition, the timing of the Company’s collections of
receivables for export shipments of vehicles, fleet sales, as well as sales of powertrain systems and pre-assembled parts of
vehicles tend to be longer due to different payment terms. Although we regularly enter into factoring transactions for such
receivables in order to accelerate collections and transfer relevant risks to the factor, a change in vehicle shipment volumes
could cause fluctuations in the Company’s working capital. The increased internationalization of our product portfolio could
also affect our working capital requirements as there could be an increased requirement to ship vehicles to countries different
from where they are produced. In addition, working capital could be affected by the trend and seasonality of shipments of
vehicles with a buy-back commitment.

Management believes that the funds currently available to Stellantis at the date of this report, in addition to those
funds that would be generated from operating and financing activities, will enable the Company to meet its obligations and
fund its businesses including funding planned investments, working capital needs as well as fulfill the Company’s obligations
to repay its debts in the ordinary course of business.

Fidis S.p.A., 100 percent owned captive finance company, supports working capital needs in all regions at a
Company level (including the Maserati segment), as well as selected suppliers, through the offering of receivable and payable
financing activity (also known as factoring). In addition, Fidis S.p.A. provides financing to selected dealers in Italy.

Liquidity needs are met primarily through cash generated from operations, including the sale of vehicles, service and
parts to dealers, distributors and other consumers worldwide.

The operating cash management and liquidity investment of the Company is coordinated with the objective of
ensuring effective and efficient management of the Company’s funds. We raise capital in the financial markets through
various funding sources.

Certain notes issued by the Company and its treasury subsidiaries included covenants which could be affected by
circumstances related to certain subsidiaries in particular; there are cross-default clauses which could accelerate repayments
in the event that such subsidiaries failed to pay certain of their debt obligations.

Long-term liquidity requirements could involve some level of debt refinancing as outstanding debt becomes due or
the Company is required to make principal payments. We regularly evaluate opportunities to improve our liquidity position in
order to enhance financial flexibility and to achieve and maintain a liquidity and capital position consistent with that of other
companies in the Company’s industry.

However, any actual or perceived limitations of the Company’s liquidity may limit the ability or willingness of
counterparties, including dealers, consumers, suppliers, lenders and financial service providers, to do business with the
Company, or require the Company to restrict additional amounts of cash to provide collateral security for its obligations. The
Company’s liquidity levels are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Risk Factors.

(1) Financial securities are comprised of short term or marketable securities which represent temporary investments but do not satisfy all the requirements to be classified as cash
equivalents as they may be subject to risk of change in value (even if they are short-term in nature or marketable).

(2) The majority of our liquidity is available to our treasury operations in Europe and U.S.; however, liquidity is also available to certain subsidiaries which operate in other
countries. Cash held in such countries may be subject to restrictions on transfer depending on the foreign jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate. Based on our review
of such transfer restrictions in the countries in which we operate and maintain material cash balances, we do not believe such transfer restrictions had an adverse impact on
the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity requirements at the dates presented above.

(3) The aggregated Available Liquidity as of December 31, 2020, is the simple aggregation of FCA and PSA (excluding Faurecia) and does not reflect purchase accounting
adjustments required by IFRS.

Available liquidity of the Industrial Activities at December 31, 2021 increased €5.4 billion from December 31, 2020
(aggregated) primarily as a result of the €6.1 billion Industrial free cash flows of the period (on a pro-forma basis).

Our Available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations resulting from business and collection
payment cycles as well as to changes in foreign exchange conversion rates. Refer to the section — Cash Flows below for

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Management

Risk management activities are an essential business driver to ensure the achievement of Stellantis objectives and the
sustainability of the business plan in the medium to long term. The Company has adopted an integrated approach aimed at
strengthening the awareness, at every level of the organization, that adequate risk assessment and management can create and
preserve value for Stellantis. A structured process has been implemented to integrate risks identification, assessment,
monitoring and mitigation into business practices, and to provide Management with information necessary to take the
appropriate decisions for achieving the strategic objectives.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework

The Stellantis risk management framework is based on the principles of the 2017 COSO Framework "Enterprise
Risk Management (ERM) - Integrating with Strategy and Performance" and of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.

In alignment with the COSO principles, the Stellantis ERM framework integrates risk management processes into
the management of the Company’s business with the aim of implementing the strategy, improving the performance
measurement and creating long-term value.

The framework is integrated within the Stellantis organization and corporate governance and supports the protection
of corporate assets, the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, the reliability of financial information and the
compliance with laws and regulations.

Stellantis Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework consists of five key components:
1. ERM Governance Structure

The risk management process is implemented across the whole organization. The Company leverages a risk
management governance that involves several committees, regions and business functions, risk owners and ERM to manage
business risks and to define the most effective strategies for their mitigation.

A Global Risk management Committee (GRMC) has been established to promote a culture of proactive risk
management and monitoring throughout Stellantis and it is chaired by the Head of HR & Transformation. Other members are
representatives from the legal, finance, internal audit, risk management and business functions. The GRMC provides
guidance on the overall strategic Risk management decisions and defines the Company’s Risk Appetite.

2. Strategy Setting and Risk Appetite

The alignment of business objectives to strategy is achieved through Stellantis governance committees which
include senior management responsible for supporting risk governance. ERM is integrated into the strategic plan and business
objectives through the GRMC members that are part of the governance committees. Through an integrated approach
Stellantis governance committees support the Strategy Council that is ultimately responsible for risk management programs,
providing guidance and direction, reviewing and approving the overall global Enterprise Risk Assessment results and
ensuring accountability for effectively managing and mitigating significant risks. The Board of Directors has an oversight
role over Stellantis’ strategy and risk appetite.

Stellantis aligns its Risk Appetite to its business plan. Risk boundaries are set through Stellantis strategy, Code of
Conduct, budgets and policies. Stellantis objectives are consistent with the organization's risk appetite.

Stellantis’ risk appetite differs by risk category as shown below.

Compliance Risk of non-compliance with relevant regulations and laws, We hold ourselves, as well as our employees,
internal policies and procedures. responsible for acting with honesty, integrity and

respect, including complying with our Code of
Conduct, applicable laws and regulations
everywhere we do business.

3. Enterprise Risk Assessment

The Enterprise Risk Assessment (ERA) is performed annually to identify and prioritize the major risks based on
their criticality, with a bottom up approach, through interviews conducted with a representative range of regional and
business function managers. Risk scenarios and evaluation are carried out using likelihood, impact and control effectiveness
criteria. The results of the assessment are consolidated on a risk mapping and compared with risk thresholds to determine
priority and risk treatment methods. The risk mapping is then reviewed by executive leadership before presentation for
approval to the Strategy Council and final validation by the Audit Committee.

4. Risk Mitigation and Monitoring

Major risks are assigned to Risk Owners in charge of deploying the adequate risk mitigation measures. Progress
made in implementing mitigation actions is monitored by the ERM team and reported to the Strategy Council.

5. Risk Management Integration and Culture Dissemination

Management uses relevant information from both internal and external sources to support enterprise risk
management. To support the business in pursuing continuous risk management process improvement and to promote a
culture that proactively identify, evaluate and monitor risks, ERM relies on the support of a Compliance Champions network
responsible for building or updating annually the Risk Assessment of their Departments and supervising the relative risk
mitigation action plans.

Significant Risks Identified and Control Measures

Results of the annual Enterprise Risk Assessment were consolidated into a Stellantis report for review with members
of the GRMC before the presentation of the most significant risks to the Stellantis Strategy Council. Once validated, results
were discussed with the Audit Committee, assisting the Board of Directors in their responsibility for strategic oversight of
risk management activities. Risk mitigating actions will be monitored by ERM team and Compliance Champions.

Each significant risk was classified by risk categories and control measures and mitigating actions were defined for
each identified risk.

The list of risks, control measures and mitigating actions presented below is not exhaustive. The sequence in which

these risks and mitigating actions are described does not reflect any order of importance, likelihood of occurrence or control
measures effectiveness.

Control measures and comprehensive mitigation actions for key global risks were monitored throughout the year by
Stellantis senior leaders in the regions and in the business functions to ensure that these were relevant and sufficient, under
the oversight of the related global leaders. As needed, control measures and mitigation actions were enhanced to ensure risks
were appropriately addressed. This approach allowed Stellantis to address risk on a timely basis and ensure effectiveness of
the control measures taken.

The risk from the merger related to the successful realization of expected synergies was mitigated through the execution of
strategic programs, such as the rationalization of vehicle platforms, the electrification strategy and the brand portfolio
strategy.
Improvements in the overall Stellantis risk management process

Stellantis will continue to engage the business in key risk areas, benchmark processes with peer companies and

explore opportunities for improvement, in order to strengthen and improve ERM Governance, evaluate remediation plans and
define Key Risk Indicators for implementing quantitative metrics to measure and monitor risks in a more predictive way.

Risk Factors

As Stellantis, we face a variety of risks in our business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only
ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may
also become important factors that affect us.

Risks Related to Our Business, Strategy and Operations
We may continue to experience a negative impact on our operations as a result of unfilled semiconductor orders.

Our ability to manufacture vehicles depends on continued access to semiconductors and components that incorporate
semiconductors and we depend upon third parties to supply these semiconductors and related components. Many of the key
semiconductors used in our vehicles come from limited or single sources of supply.

In 2020, we began experiencing a significant semiconductor supply shortage as a result of unfilled orders, which has
resulted in increased chip delivery lead times, reduced vehicle production volumes, and increased costs to source available
semiconductors. Our overall vehicle shipment volumes in 2021 were significantly impacted by unfulfilled semiconductor
orders, representing a loss of approximately 20 percent of our planned production. We have continued to experience a
negative impact in early 2022 and expect conditions to improve, but remain challenging, throughout the year.

To the extent such unfilled orders continue or worsen, and we are unable to mitigate its effects, our ability to deliver
planned quantities of our vehicles will continue to be adversely affected, which may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” for further discussion of the effect that unfilled semiconductor orders has had on our operations.

We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.

Before the closing of the merger on January 16, 2021, FCA and PSA operated independently as separate companies.
The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies, growth
opportunities and other benefits from combining the businesses. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the merger is
subject to a number of uncertainties, including general competitive factors in the marketplace and whether we are able to
integrate the businesses of FCA and PSA in an efficient and effective manner and establish and implement effective
operational principles and procedures. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases
in our revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, and could materially impact our business, cash flows,
financial condition or results of operations. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated cost
savings, synergies, growth opportunities and other benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the merger may not be
realized fully, or at all, or may take longer than expected to realize.

We have devoted, and will need to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating
the business practices and operations of FCA and PSA. Potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration
process include complexities associated with managing our business, such as difficulty integrating manufacturing processes,
systems and technology, in a seamless manner, as well as integration of the FCA and PSA workforces. We have also incurred
significant costs associated with the transaction, including the migration of our headquarters to the Netherlands, and expect to
continue to incur significant costs in the future. In addition, the integration of FCA’s and PSA’s businesses may result in
additional and unforeseen expenses, capital investments and financial risks, such as the incurrence of unexpected write-offs,
the possible effect of adverse tax treatments and unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to FCA, PSA or the merger. All
of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger.

It is possible that the integration process could take longer or be more costly than anticipated or could result in the
loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies
that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with suppliers, customers and employees, achieve the anticipated
benefits of the merger or maintain quality standards. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated
benefits of the merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our
business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations, which may affect the value of our common shares.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could continue to disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products and the
provision of our services and adversely impact our business.

On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization,
leading to government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions, “stay-at-home” orders and similar mandates for many
individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. The impact of
COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, as well as restrictions on
business and individual activities, led to a global economic slowdown and a significant decrease in demand in the global
automotive market, followed by a dramatic but uneven increase in economic activity and automotive market demand when
restrictions were lifted.

COVID-19 related disruptions have had a significant negative impact on, and may continue to negatively impact, our
supply chain and the availability and price at which we are able to source components and raw materials globally, which
could reduce the number of vehicles we will be able to sell. We may not be able to pass on future increases in the price of
components and raw materials to our customers, which may adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, the
long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to financial distress for our suppliers or dealers, as a result of which
they may have to permanently discontinue or substantially reduce their operations. We expect that the economic uncertainty
and higher unemployment may result in higher defaults in our consumer financing portfolio and prolonged unemployment
may negatively impact demand for both new and used vehicles. These and other factors arising from the COVID-19
pandemic have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Further, as government restrictions on movement and business operations vary between jurisdictions and regions,
even if measures are not mandated by law or regulation, we may still elect to shut down some, or all, of our production sites
and other facilities, either in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 among our employees, or as a preventive measure to
contain the spread of the virus and protect the health of our workforce and their respective communities. Such restrictions on
movement and business operations may be reimposed by governments in response to future recurrences or “waves” of the
outbreak. For example, in late 2021 and early 2022, to combat the spread of the Omicron variant, several governments re-
imposed a range of restrictive measures. Future developments in the pandemic cannot be predicted.

In addition, future government-sponsored liquidity or stimulus programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may
not be available to our customers, suppliers, dealers, or the combined group, and if available, the terms may be unattractive or
may be insufficient to address the impact of COVID-19.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our results will depend on the scale, duration, severity and
geographic reach of future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The ultimate impact of the
COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the length and severity of restrictions on business and individuals, the pandemic’s impact
on customers, dealers, and suppliers, whether and how quickly normal economic conditions, operations and demand for
vehicles resume, any permanent behavioral changes that the pandemic may cause, including with respect to remote work, and
any future actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, whether government-mandated or elected by us.

The future impact of COVID-19 developments will be greater if the regions and markets that are most profitable for
us are particularly affected. See “Jf our vehicle shipment volumes deteriorate further, particularly shipments of pickup trucks
and larger sport utility vehicles in the U.S. market, and shipments of vehicles in the European market, our results of
operations and financial condition will suffer”. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate many of the other risks
described in this report, including, but not limited to, the general economic conditions in which we operate, increases in the
cost of raw materials and components and disruptions to our supply chain and liquidity.

93


--- Page 85 ---

If our vehicle shipment volumes deteriorate further, particularly shipments of pickup trucks and larger sport utility
vehicles in the U.S. market, and overall shipments of vehicles in the European market, our results of operations and
financial condition will suffer.

As is typical for automotive manufacturers, we have significant fixed costs primarily due to our substantial
investment in product development, property, plant and equipment and the requirements of collective bargaining agreements
and other applicable labor relations regulations. As a result, changes in certain vehicle shipment volumes could have a
disproportionately large effect on our profitability. Our overall vehicle shipments volumes were significantly impacted in
2021 and early 2022 due to unfilled semiconductor orders, representing a loss of approximately 20 percent of our planned
production in 2021. Although we have largely been able to maintain shipment volumes of pickup trucks and larger SUVs in
North America, overall volumes in Europe were significantly lower in 2021 than in 2020.

Our profitability in North America, a region which historically contributed a majority of FCA’s profit, is particularly
dependent on demand for pickup trucks and larger SUVs. Pickup trucks and larger SUVs have historically been more
profitable than other vehicles and accounted for approximately 82 percent of our total U.S. retail vehicle shipments in 2021.

A shift in consumer demand away from these vehicles within the North America region, and towards compact and mid-size
passenger cars, whether in response to higher fuel prices or other factors, could adversely affect our profitability. Dependence
on pickup trucks and larger SUVs in North America is expected to continue.

Historically, PSA’s operating results reflected a dependence on European markets, which increased with the purchase
of the Opel and Vauxhall brands in August 2017. In 2021, we generated a significant percentage of our profits and
approximately 39 percent of our revenues in the Enlarged Europe region. Therefore, we are significantly exposed to a
slowdown or downturn in economic conditions in Europe, as well as enhanced competition in, or a deterioration of, the
European vehicle market, that would trigger a decline in vehicle shipments in that market.

In addition, our larger vehicles, such as SUVs, tend to be priced higher and be more profitable on a per vehicle basis
than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle lines. In recent years, the profitability of these models has been
supported by strong consumer preference for SUVs, but there is no guarantee that this trend will continue in the future. For
additional information on factors affecting our vehicle profitability, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities — Vehicle Profitability”.

Moreover, we operate with negative working capital as we generally receive payment for vehicles within a few days
of shipment, whereas there is a lag between the time when parts and materials are received from suppliers and when we pay
for such parts and materials. Accordingly, in periods in which vehicle shipments decline materially, we may suffer a
significant negative impact on cash flow and liquidity as we continue to pay suppliers for components purchased in a high-
volume environment during a period in which we receive lower proceeds from vehicle shipments. If vehicle shipments
decline, or if they were to fall short of our assumptions, due to downturn in economic conditions, changes in consumer
confidence, geopolitical events, inability to produce sufficient quantities of certain vehicles, enhanced competition in certain
markets, loss of market share, limited access to financing or other factors, such decline or shortfall could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business may be adversely affected by global financial markets, general economic conditions, enforcement of
government incentive programs, and geopolitical volatility as well as other macro developments over which we have little
or no control.

With operations worldwide, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by
macroeconomic factors within the various countries in which we operate, including changes in gross domestic product, the
level of consumer and business confidence, changes in interest rates for, or availability of, consumer and business credit, the
rate of unemployment, foreign currency controls and changes in exchange rates, as well as geopolitical risks, such as
government instability, social unrest, the rise of nationalism and populism and disputes between sovereign states.

94


--- Page 86 ---

We are subject to other risks, such as increases in energy and fuel prices and fluctuations in prices of raw materials,
including as a result of tariffs or other protectionist measures, changes to vehicle purchase incentive programs, and
contractions in infrastructure spending in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, these factors may also have an
adverse effect on our ability to fully utilize our industrial capacity in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Unfavorable developments in any one or a combination of these risks (which may vary from country to country) could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to execute planned
strategies. For further discussion of risks related to the automotive industry, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Industry
in which We Operate’.

We have operations in a number of emerging markets, including Turkey, China, Brazil, Argentina, India and Russia
and are particularly susceptible to risks relating to local political conditions in these markets. For example, although it is not
expected to have a direct material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we cannot reliably
predict the direct or indirect impact that the current Russian military activities in the Ukraine or any related international
sanctions may have on our operations. We are also subject to import and/or export restrictions (including the imposition of
tariffs on raw materials and components we procure and on the vehicles we sell), and compliance with local laws and
regulations in these markets. For example, in Brazil, we have historically received certain tax benefits and other government
grants, that favorably affected our results of operations which, if not further extended, would expire at the end of 2025.
Expiration of these tax benefits and government grants without their renewal or any change in the amount of such tax benefits
or government grants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are also subject to other risks inherent to operating globally. For a discussion of certain tax-related risks related to
our operating globally, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Taxation—We and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws and
treaties of numerous jurisdictions. Future changes to such laws or treaties could adversely affect us and our subsidiaries and
our shareholders and holders of special voting shares. In addition, the interpretation of these laws and treaties is subject to
challenge by the relevant governmental authorities”. European developments in data and digital taxation may also negatively
affect some of our autonomous driving and infotainment connected services. Unfavorable developments in any one or a
combination of these risk areas (which may vary from country to country) could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to execute planned strategies.

Following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement
became effective on a provisional basis on January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021. Under the terms of the
EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, exports of motor vehicles and parts between the European Union and the United
Kingdom are exempt from tariffs, to the extent the goods comply with certain “rules of origin” (i.e. if the goods contain a
sufficient quantity of European Union or United Kingdom inputs). Despite the implementation of the EU-UK Trade and
Cooperation Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how Brexit will affect relations between the United
Kingdom and the EU and we continue to assess the full impact of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on our
operations and on our supply chain. The application of the rules of origin may result in increased costs for us or for our
suppliers (which, in turn, they would seek to pass on to us), and difficulties in the procurement of parts. In addition, the new
customs procedures set forth in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement result in increased complexity, with full
import controls for goods being imported from the European Union to the United Kingdom expected to be gradually
introduced by the United Kingdom throughout 2022. The introduction of full import controls for goods being imported from
the European Union to the United Kingdom could increase our costs of manufacturing in the United Kingdom or importing
vehicles to the United Kingdom that are manufactured in the European Union, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

While the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides clarity with respect to the intended relationship
between the European Union and the United Kingdom going forward, negotiations are expected to continue in relation to the
details of such relationship in certain areas which are not covered by the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The
long term effects of Brexit will depend on the effects of the implementation and application of the EU-UK Trade and
Cooperation Agreement and any other relevant agreements between the United Kingdom and European Union. The foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

95


--- Page 87 ---

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in activity and speculation regarding tariffs and other barriers to
trade imposed between governments in various regions, in particular the U.S. and its trading partners, China and the
European Union. For example, we manufacture a significant number of our vehicles outside the U.S. (particularly in Canada,
Mexico and Italy) for import into the U.S. We also manufacture vehicles in the U.S. that are exported to China. Tariffs or
duties that impact our products could reduce consumer demand, make our products less profitable or the cost of required raw
materials more expensive or delay or limit our access to these raw materials, each of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an escalation in tariff or duty activity
between the U.S. and its major trading partners could negatively impact global economic activity, which could in turn reduce
demand for our products.

Our future performance depends on our ability to offer innovative, attractive and relevant products.

Our success depends on, among other things, our ability to develop innovative, high-quality products that are
attractive to consumers and provide adequate profitability. We may not be able to effectively compete with other automakers
with regard to electrification, autonomous driving, mobility, artificial intelligence and other emerging trends in the industry.

In 2021, we announced plans to make significant investments in electrification and set aggressive targets for future
low emission vehicle shipments. If we are unable to deliver a broad portfolio of electrified vehicles that are competitively
priced and meet consumer demands, if consumers prefer our competitors’ electrified vehicles or if the adoption of electrified
vehicles develops slower than we expect, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. We face challenges developing electrified vehicles with increased vehicle range and battery energy
density and we may not successfully invest in new technologies that enable us to develop competitive electrified vehicles
relative to our peers. In addition, the availability of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles has fueled highly competitive pricing
among automakers in order to win market share, which may significantly and adversely affect profits with respect to the sale
of such vehicles. Furthermore, technological capabilities acquired through costly investment may prove short-lived, for
example, if technology and vehicle capability progresses more quickly than expected. Vehicle electrification may also
negatively affect after-sales revenues.

In certain cases, the technologies that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant
future technological advances by us, our partners and suppliers. These advances may not occur in a timely or feasible manner,
we may not obtain rights to use these technologies and the funds that we have budgeted or expended for these purposes may
not be adequate. Further, our competitors and others are pursuing similar and other competing technologies, and they may
acquire and implement similar or superior technologies sooner than we will or on an exclusive basis or at a significant cost
advantage. Even where we are able to develop competitive technologies, we may not be able to profit from such
developments as anticipated.

Further, as a result of the extended product development cycle and inherent difficulty in predicting consumer
acceptance, a vehicle that is expected to be attractive may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices
to be profitable. It can take several years to design and develop a new vehicle, and a number of factors may lengthen that
schedule. For example, if we determine that a safety or emissions defect, mechanical defect or non-compliance with
regulation exists with respect to a vehicle model prior to retail launch, the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until we
remedy the defect or non-compliance. Various elements may also contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle
designs, including competitors’ product introductions, fuel prices, general economic conditions and changes in consumer
preferences. In addition, vehicles we develop in order to comply with government regulations, particularly those related to
fuel efficiency, greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions standards, may not be attractive to consumers or may not generate
sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable.

If we fail to develop products that contain desirable technologies and are attractive to and accepted by consumers, the
residual value of our vehicles could be negatively impacted. In addition, the increasing pace of inclusion of new innovations
and technologies in our and our competitors’ vehicles could also negatively impact the residual value of our vehicles. A
deterioration in residual value could increase the cost that consumers pay to lease our vehicles or increase the amount of
subvention payments that we make to support our leasing programs.

The failure to develop and offer innovative, attractive and relevant products on a timely basis could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our success largely depends on the ability of our management team to operate and manage effectively and our ability to
attract and retain experienced management and employees.

Our success largely depends on the ability of our senior executives and other members of management to effectively
manage the company and individual areas of the business. Our management team is critical to the execution of our direction
and the implementation of our strategies. In particular, current employees may be dissatisfied with their roles within Stellantis
following the merger integration, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to retain management and other key
personnel. We may not be able to replace these individuals with persons of equivalent experience and capabilities.

Attracting and retaining qualified and experienced personnel in each of our regions is critical to our competitive
position in the automotive industry. For example, our ability to attract and retain qualified software engineers is critical to our
software strategy announced in December 2021.

An overall labor shortage, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors,
could further challenge our ability to attract and retain key personnel. If we are unable to find adequate replacements or to
attract, retain and incentivize senior executives, other key employees or new qualified personnel, such inability could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be unsuccessful in efforts to increase the growth of some of our brands that we believe have global appeal and
reach, which could have material adverse effects on our business.

Historically, FCA experienced challenges in expanding the product range and global sales of certain brands, in
particular, Alfa Romeo. PSA experienced challenges with respect to the visibility of its brands in China and Russia, which
led to reduced sales for PSA’s products in those markets. In addition, we may not be successful in positioning our DS brand
as a premium brand in light of competition from established premium brands that benefit from favorable reputations and
significant marketing budgets.

We intend to continue to focus on volume growth and margin expansion strategies, which include the renewal of key
products, the launch of white-space products, the implementation of various electrified powertrain applications and
partnerships relating to the development of autonomous driving technologies. Our strategies continue to require significant
investments in products, powertrains, production facilities, marketing and distribution networks. If we are unable to achieve
our volume growth and margin expansion goals, we may be unable to earn a sufficient return on these investments, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth and investment
strategy may also be adversely impacted by future potential developments of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “The coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic could continue to disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products and the provision of our services
and adversely impact our business.”

Labor laws and collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions could impact our ability to increase the efficiency
of our operations, and we may be subject to work stoppages in the event we are unable to agree on collective bargaining
agreement terms or have other disagreements.

Substantially all of our production employees are represented by trade unions, covered by collective bargaining
agreements or protected by applicable labor relations regulations that may restrict our ability to modify operations and reduce
personnel costs quickly in response to changes in market conditions and demand for our products. As of December 31, 2021,
approximately 87 percent of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. See the section “—Trade
Unions and Collective Bargaining” of this report for a description of these arrangements. These and other provisions in our
collective bargaining agreements may impede our ability to restructure our business successfully in order to compete more
effectively, especially with automakers whose employees are not represented by trade unions or are subject to less stringent
regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, we may be subject to work stoppages in the event that we and our labor unions are unable to agree on collective
bargaining agreement terms or have other disagreements. Any such work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our vehicles, our profitability may be affected.

We take steps to improve efficiency in our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics processes. This includes
planning production based on sales forecasts, and in particular producing certain vehicle models with specified features based
on forecasted dealer and end customer orders, which is expected to allow us to more efficiently and cost effectively manage
our supply chain. This practice may result in higher finished goods inventory in certain periods when we anticipate increased
dealer and end customer orders. Further, while it is expected that our analytical tools should enable us to align production
with dealer and end customer orders, if such orders do not meet our forecasts, our profitability on these vehicles may be
affected.

Our reliance on partnerships in order to offer consumers and dealers financing and leasing services exposes us to risks,
including that our competitors may be able to offer consumers and dealers financing and leasing services on better terms
than our consumers and dealers are able to obtain.

Our dealers enter into wholesale financing arrangements to purchase vehicles from us to hold in inventory and
facilitate retail sales, and retail consumers use a variety of finance and lease programs to acquire vehicles. Unlike many of our
competitors, we do not own and operate a wholly-owned finance company dedicated solely to our mass-market vehicle
operations in the majority of key markets in Europe, Asia and South America. In addition, although we are in the process of
establishing a captive finance company in the U.S., we do not yet have a fully operational wholly-owned provider in that
market. We instead partner with specialized financial services providers through joint ventures and commercial agreements
with third parties, including third party financial institutions, in order to provide financing to our dealers and retail
consumers. Our lack of a wholly-owned finance company in these key markets may increase the risk that our dealers and
retail consumers will not have access to sufficient financing on acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our vehicle
sales in the future.

Furthermore, many of our competitors are better able to implement financing programs designed to maximize vehicle
sales in a manner that optimizes profitability for them and their finance companies on an aggregate basis. Since our ability to
compete depends on access to appropriate sources of financing for dealers and retail consumers, our reliance on partnerships
in those markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Potential capital constraints may impair the financial services providers’ ability to provide competitive financing
products to our dealers and retail consumers. For example, any financial services provider, including our joint ventures and
controlled finance companies, will also face other demands on its capital, including the need or desire to satisfy funding
requirements for dealers or consumers of our competitors as well as liquidity issues relating to other investments.
Furthermore, they may be subject to regulatory changes that may increase their cost of capital or capital requirements.

To the extent that a financial services provider is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient financing at competitive
rates to our dealers and retail consumers, such dealers and retail consumers may not have sufficient access to financing to
purchase or lease vehicles. As a result, our vehicle sales and market share may suffer, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our establishment of a captive financial services company in the U.S. will subject us to the risks inherent in that business.

In 2021, we announced the completion of our acquisition of a financial services company in the U.S., and our intent to
grow it into a full-service captive finance arm, named Stellantis Financial Services US Corp., that will provide U.S.
customers, dealers and partners with a complete range of financing options. The growth and maintenance of a U.S. captive
financial services company will subject us to the risks inherent in such business, including reliance on public debt markets to
provide the capital necessary to support our financing programs, underwriting risk, default risk, compliance with laws and
regulations related to consumer lending and competition with other consumer finance companies and third-party financial
institutions.

We face risks related to changes in product distribution methods.

We are exposed to risks inherent in certain new methods of distribution, including the digitalization of points of sale
and, more broadly, the transformation of our sales network in order to respond to developing trends in the automotive
industry such as consumers’ shift towards online sales, and the use of digital tools that are altering the relationship between
brands and customers. Delays in the digital transformation of distribution methods, both at points of sale and in sales
networks, as well as increased costs, whether as a result of the transformation of our sales network or new distribution
methods, could impact our ability to effectively compete with other automakers. In addition, our employees may lack the
necessary skills or training to implement or utilize such new distribution methods. Changes in our product distribution
methods may also lengthen the timing or pattern of when we recognize revenue and increase our working capital
requirements. If there is a delay or failure to implement new distribution methods or such transitions are not successful, there
may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant security breach compromising the electronic control systems contained in our vehicles could damage our
reputation, disrupt our business and adversely impact our ability to compete.

Our vehicles, as well as vehicles manufactured by other original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), contain
complex systems that control various vehicle processes including engine, transmission, safety, steering, brakes, window and
door lock functions. These electronic control systems, which are increasingly connected to external cloud-based systems, are
susceptible to cybercrime, including threats of intentional disruptions, loss of control over the vehicle, loss of functionality or
services and theft of personal information. These disruptions are likely to increase in terms of sophistication and frequency as
the level of connectivity and autonomy in our vehicles increases. In addition, we may rely on third parties for connectivity
and automation technology and services, including for the collection of our customers’ data. These third parties could
unlawfully resell or otherwise misuse such information, or suffer data breaches. A significant malfunction, disruption or
security breach compromising the electronic control systems contained in our vehicles could damage our reputation, expose
us to significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

A significant malfunction, disruption or security breach compromising the operation of our information technology
systems could damage our reputation, disrupt our business and adversely impact our ability to compete.

Our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of our
information, data processing and telecommunications systems, including our vehicle design, manufacturing, inventory
tracking and billing and payment systems, as well as other central information systems and applications, employee
workstations and other IT equipment. Our vehicles are also increasingly connected to external cloud-based systems while our
industrial facilities have become more computerized. Our systems are susceptible to cybercrime and are regularly the target
of threats from third parties, which could result in data theft, loss of control of data processed in an external cloud,
compromised IT networks and stoppages in operations. In addition, the majority of our office personnel moved to a “remote
work” model in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and full- or part-time remote work is now expected to be a permanent
option for this personnel. Remote work relies heavily on the use of remote networking and online conferencing services,
which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks.

A significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of any one of our computer or data processing systems,
including through the exploitation of a weakness in our systems or the systems of our suppliers or service providers, could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage and keep our manufacturing and other operations running effectively,
and may damage our reputation. A malfunction or security breach that results in a wide or sustained disruption to our
business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to supporting our operations, our systems collect and store confidential and sensitive data, including
information about our business, consumers and employees. As technology continues to evolve, it is expected that we will
collect and store even more data in the future and that our systems will increasingly use remote communication features that
are sensitive to both willful and unintentional security breaches. Much of our value is derived from our confidential business
information, including vehicle design, proprietary technology and trade secrets, and to the extent the confidentiality of such
information is compromised, we may lose our competitive advantage and our vehicle shipments may suffer. We also collect,
retain and use personal information, including data gathered from consumers for product development and marketing
purposes, and data obtained from employees. In the event of a breach in security that allows third parties access to this
personal information, we will be subject to a variety of laws on a global basis that could require us to provide notification to
the data owners and subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement.

For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) has increased the
stringency of European Union data protection requirements and related penalties. Non-compliance with the GDPR can result
in fines of the higher of €20 million or four percent of annual worldwide revenue. In addition, the California Consumer
Privacy Act of 2018 became effective on January 1, 2020 and provides California residents with new data privacy rights.
Several other U.S. states, and additional countries where we do business, are considering adopting laws and regulations
imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Complying with any new data protection-related regulatory
requirements could force us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that has a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our reputation could also suffer in the event of a data breach, which could cause consumers to purchase their vehicles
from our competitors. Ultimately, any significant compromise in the integrity of our data security could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our reliance on joint arrangements in certain emerging markets may adversely affect the development of our business in
those regions.

We operate, or expect to expand our presence, in emerging markets, such as China and India, through partnerships
and joint ventures. For instance, we operate the GAC FCA joint venture with Guangzhou Automobiles Group Co., Ltd.,
which locally produces the Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Renegade, Jeep Compass, Jeep Grand Commander and Jeep Commander
PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) primarily for the Chinese market, expanding the portfolio of Jeep SUVs currently
available to Chinese consumers. Similarly, we operate a joint venture in China with Dongfeng Motor Group, namely
Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Automobile (“DPCA”), which manufactures vehicles under the Dongfeng Peugeot and Dongfeng
Citroén brands in China, and Dongfeng Peugeot Citroén Automobile Sales Co, which markets the vehicles produced by
DPCA in China. In India, we have a joint operation with TATA Motors Limited for the production of certain of our vehicles,
engines and transmissions and joint ventures with CK Birla Group for the manufacture of vehicles and powertrains.

Although our sales in the markets where these arrangements exist are currently limited, our ability to grow in these
markets is important to our strategy and any issues with these arrangements may adversely affect those growth prospects. Our
reliance on joint arrangements to enter or expand our presence in emerging markets may expose us to the risk of
disagreement with our joint arrangement partners and the need to divert management resources to oversee these
arrangements. Further, as these arrangements require cooperation with third party partners, these joint arrangements may not
be able to make decisions as quickly as we would if we were operating on our own or may take actions that are different from
what we would do on a standalone basis in light of the need to consider our partners’ interests. As a result, we may be less
able to respond timely to changes in market dynamics, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to the Industry in which We Operate

The automotive industry is highly competitive and cyclical, and we may suffer from those factors more than some of our
competitors.

Substantially all of our revenues are generated in the automotive industry, which is highly competitive and cyclical,
encompassing the production and distribution of passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and components and systems. We
face competition from other international passenger car and light commercial vehicle manufacturers and distributors and
components suppliers in Europe, North America, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. These
markets are all highly competitive in terms of product quality, innovation, the introduction of new technologies, response to
new regulatory requirements, pricing, fuel economy, reliability, safety, consumer service and financial or software services
offered. Some of our competitors are also better capitalized than we are and command larger market shares, which may
enable them to compete more effectively in these markets. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of new entrants in the
automotive market, which may have technological, marketing and other capabilities, or financial resources, that are superior
to ours and of other traditional automobile manufacturers and may disrupt the industry in a way that is detrimental to us. In
particular, we are exposed to risks from non-OEM startup technology companies that may enter into alliances with our
competitors and enable them to introduce disruptive solutions, as well as risks from startup OEMs that are increasingly able
to access public capital markets through initial public offerings or business combinations with special purpose acquisition
companies.

If our competitors are able to successfully integrate with one another or enter into significant partnerships with non-
OEM technology companies, or if new competitors emerge as a result of the increased flow of capital toward potentially
disruptive OEMs, and we are not able to adapt effectively to increased competition, our competitors’ integration or the
emergence of new significant competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

In the automotive business, sales to consumers and fleet customers are cyclical and subject to changes in the general
condition of the economy, the readiness of consumers and fleet customers to buy and their ability to obtain financing, as well
as the possible introduction of measures by governments to stimulate demand, particularly related to new technologies (for
example, technologies related to compliance with evolving emissions regulations). The automotive industry is characterized
by the constant renewal of product offerings through frequent launches of new models and the incorporation of new
technologies in those models. A negative trend in the automotive industry or our inability to adapt effectively to external
market conditions, coupled with more limited capital than our principal competitors, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Intense competition, excess global manufacturing capacity and the proliferation of new products being introduced in
key segments is expected to continue to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted vehicle prices and contribute to a
challenging pricing environment in the automotive industry for the foreseeable future. In the event that industry shipments
decrease and overcapacity intensifies, our competitors may attempt to make their vehicles more attractive or less expensive to
consumers by adding vehicle enhancements, providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, or by reducing vehicle
prices whether directly or by offering option package discounts, price rebates or other sales incentives in certain markets.
Manufacturers in countries that have lower production costs may also choose to export lower-cost automobiles to more
established markets. In addition, our profitability depends in part on our ability to adjust pricing to reflect increasing
technological costs (see “—Our future performance depends on our ability to offer innovative, attractive and fuel efficient
products”). An increase in any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

101


--- Page 93 ---

Vehicle retail sales depend heavily on affordable interest rates and availability of credit for vehicle financing and a
substantial increase in interest rates could adversely affect our business.

In certain regions, including Europe and North America, financing for new vehicle sales has been available at
relatively low interest rates for several years due to, among other things, expansive government monetary policies. If interest
rates rise, market rates for new vehicle financing will generally be expected to rise as well, which may make our vehicles less
affordable to retail consumers or steer consumers to less expensive vehicles that would be less profitable for us, adversely
affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if consumer interest rates increase substantially or if
financial service providers tighten lending standards or restrict their lending to certain classes of credit, consumers may not
desire or be able to obtain financing to purchase or lease our vehicles. If recent and ongoing increases in inflation in key
markets persist, there could be subsequent increases in the cost of borrowing and the availability of affordable credit for
vehicle financing. Furthermore, because purchasers of our vehicles may be relatively more sensitive to changes in the
availability and adequacy of financing and macroeconomic conditions, our vehicle sales may be disproportionately affected
by changes in financing conditions relative to the vehicle sales of our competitors. As a result, a substantial increase in
consumer interest rates or tightening of lending standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We face risks associated with increases in costs, disruptions of supply or shortages of raw materials, parts, components
and systems used in our vehicles.

We use a variety of raw materials in our business, including steel, aluminum, lead, polymers, elastomers, resin and
copper, and precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium, as well as electricity and natural gas. Also, as we
implement various electrified powertrain applications throughout our portfolio, we will also depend on a significant supply of
lithium, nickel and cobalt, which are used in lithium-ion batteries.

The prices for these raw materials fluctuate, and market conditions can affect our ability to manage our costs.
Increased market power of raw material suppliers may contribute to such prices increasing. Additionally, as production of
electric vehicles increases, we may face shortages of raw materials and lithium cells and be forced to pay higher prices to
obtain them. We may not be successful in managing our exposure to these risks. Substantial increases in the prices for raw
materials would increase our operating costs and could reduce profitability if the increased costs cannot be offset by higher
vehicle prices or productivity gains. In particular, certain raw materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers and
from a limited number of countries, particularly those needed in catalytic converters and lithium-ion batteries. From time to
time these may be susceptible to supply shortages or disruptions. In addition, our industrial efficiency will depend in part on
the optimization of the raw materials and components used in the manufacturing processes. If we fail to optimize these
processes, we may face increased production costs.

We are also exposed to the risk of price fluctuations and supply disruptions and shortages, including due to supplier
disputes, particularly with regard to warranty recovery claims, supplier financial distress, tight credit markets, trade
restrictions, tariffs, natural or man-made disasters, epidemics or pandemics of diseases, or production difficulties. For
example, we experienced a significant increase in the cost of raw materials and a shortage of certain key components in 2021.
More broadly, recent inflationary pressures in many of the markets in which we operate have resulted in increased wages,
fuel, freight and other costs. To the extent we are unable to recoup related cost increases through pricing actions, our profits
will decrease. In addition, even if we are able to increase prices, there may be a time lag between our cost increases and price
adjustments, which may cause volatility in our earnings and cash flows. To the extent such inflation continues, increases, or
both, it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.

It is not possible to guarantee that we will be able to maintain arrangements with suppliers that assure access to these
raw materials at reasonable prices in the future. Fluctuations in the price of parts and components can adversely affect our
costs and profitability, and any such effect may be material. Further, trade restrictions and tariffs may be imposed, leading to
increases in the cost of raw materials and delayed or limited access to purchases of raw materials, each of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

102


--- Page 94 ---

Any interruption in the supply or any increase in the cost of raw materials, parts, components and systems could
negatively impact our ability to achieve our vehicle shipment objectives and profitability and delay commercial launches. The
potential impact of an interruption is particularly high in instances where a part or component is sourced exclusively from a
single supplier. Long-term interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, components and systems may result in a
material impact on vehicle production, vehicle shipment objectives, and profitability. Cost increases which cannot be
recouped through increases in vehicle prices, or countered by productivity gains, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. This risk can increase during periods of economic uncertainty such as
the crisis resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19, or as a result of regional economic disruptions such as that experienced
in South America due to the deterioration in Argentina’s economic condition in recent years. With respect to the potential
impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our supply chain, see “—The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could continue to
disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products and the provision of our services and adversely impact our business.”

We are subject to risks related to natural and industrial disasters, terrorist attacks and climatic or other catastrophic
events.

Our production facilities and storage facilities for finished vehicles, as well as the production and storage facilities of
our key suppliers, are subject to risks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, other climatic
phenomena, environmental disasters and other events beyond our control, such as power loss and uncertainties arising out of
armed conflicts or terrorist attacks.

Any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of our facilities would likely disrupt our operations, delay
production, and adversely affect our product development schedules, shipments and revenue. For example, in 2011, the
earthquake off the coast of Fukushima in Japan disrupted part of PSA’s diesel engine production due to a supply shortage at
one of its Japanese suppliers.

In the last decade, seismic events affecting industrialized countries have demonstrated the risk of potential property
damage and business interruption that we are exposed to as a result of our global manufacturing footprint. We are also
exposed to industrial flood risk, with a number of our production sites identified by our industrial flood risk assessment as
potentially exposed to flood risk. The occurrence of a major incident at a single manufacturing site could compromise the
production and sale of several hundred thousand vehicles. In addition, any such catastrophic loss or significant damage could
result in significant expense to repair or replace the facility and could significantly curtail our research and development
efforts in the affected area, which could have a material adverse consequence on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Our key suppliers are similarly exposed to a potential catastrophic loss or significant damage to their facilities,
and any such loss or significant damage to a key supplier’s manufacturing facilities could disrupt our operations, delay
production, and adversely affect our product development schedules, shipments and revenue.

Measures taken to protect against climate change, and limit the impact of catastrophic climate events, such as
implementing an energy management plan, which sets out steps to reuse lost heat from industrial processes, making plants
more compact and reducing logistics-related CO, emissions, as well as using renewable energy, may also lead to increased
capital expenditures.

We are subject to risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate changes and credit risk.

We operate in numerous markets worldwide and are exposed to risks stemming from fluctuations in currency and
interest rates. The exposure to currency risk is mainly linked to differences in the geographic distribution of our
manufacturing and commercial activities, resulting in cash flows from sales being denominated in currencies different from
those of purchases or production activities. Additionally, a significant portion of our operating cash flow is generated in U.S.
Dollars and, although a portion of our debt is denominated in U.S. Dollars, the majority of our indebtedness is denominated
in Euro.

We use various forms of financing to cover funding requirements for our activities. Moreover, liquidity for industrial
activities is principally invested in variable and fixed rate or short-term financial instruments. Our financial services
businesses normally operate a matching policy to offset the impact of differences in rates of interest on the financed portfolio
and related liabilities. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates can affect our net revenues, finance costs and margins.

103


--- Page 95 ---

In addition, although we manage risks associated with fluctuations in currency and interest rates through financial
hedging instruments, fluctuations in currency or interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our financial services activities are also subject to the risk of insolvency of dealers and retail consumers and this risk
is expected to increase with the establishment of our U.S. captive financial service company. Despite our efforts to mitigate
such risks through the credit approval policies applied to dealers and retail consumers, we may not be able to successfully
mitigate such risks.

Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate

Current and more stringent future or incremental laws, regulations and governmental policies, including those regarding
increased fuel efficiency requirements and reduced greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions, have a significant effect on
how we do business and may increase our cost of compliance, result in additional liabilities and negatively affect our
operations and results.

As we seek to comply with government regulations, particularly those related to fuel efficiency, vehicle safety and
greenhouse gas and tailpipe emissions standards, we must devote significant financial and management resources, as well as
vehicle engineering and design attention, to these legal requirements. For example, we intend to make significant
investments, including through joint ventures, to secure the supply of batteries that are a critical requirement to support our
electrification strategy and fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas compliance plans.

In addition, government regulations are not harmonized across jurisdictions and the regulations and their
interpretations are subject to change on short notice. Greenhouse gas emissions standards also apply to our production
facilities in several jurisdictions in which we operate, which may require investments to upgrade facilities and increase
operating costs. In addition, a failure to decrease the energy consumption of plants may lead to penalties, each of which may
adversely affect our profitability. In addition, the European Union’s Green Deal could result in changes to laws and
regulations, including requiring, or incentivizing, financial institutions to reduce lending to industries responsible for
significant greenhouse gas emissions, which could result in an increase in the cost of our European financings.

Our production facilities are also subject to a broad range of additional requirements governing environmental, health
and safety matters, including those relating to registration, use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and discharges to
water and air (including emissions of sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds and other pollutants). A
failure to comply with such requirements, or additional requirements imposed in the future, may result in substantial
penalties, claims and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We may also incur substantial cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of environmental impacts that may
be associated with our current or former properties or operations.

Regulatory requirements in relation to CO, emissions from vehicles, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency
(CAFE) standards in the U.S., are increasingly stringent. In August 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
vacated a final rule published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) in July 2019 that had
reversed NHTSA’s 2016 increase to the base rate of the CAFE penalty from $5.50 to $14.00. The base rate applies to each
tenth of a mile per gallon (“MPG”) that a manufacturer’s fleet-wide average MPG is below the CAFE standard, and is
multiplied by the number of vehicles in the manufacturer’s fleet to arrive at an aggregate penalty. In January 2021, NHTSA
published an interim final rule with immediate effect, the result of which would be to apply the increased fine rate that
resulted from the Second Circuit’s ruling to future model years. In particular, NHTSA’s rule imposes a CAFE penalty base
rate of $5.50 through 2021 Model Year and increases the CAFE penalty base rate to $14.00 prospectively from the 2022
Model Year. Several non-governmental organizations and state attorneys general have initiated litigation to overturn
NHTSA’s interim final rule. In August 2021, NHTSA published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, announcing
that it was considering withdrawing its January 2021 interim final rule. If NHTSA withdraws the rule, the CAFE penalty
base rate would increase from $5.50 to $14.00 beginning in the 2019 Model Year.

104


--- Page 96 ---

An increasing number of cities globally have also introduced restricted traffic zones, which do not permit entry to
vehicles unless they meet strict emissions standards. As a result, consumer demand may shift towards vehicles that are able to
meet these standards, which in turn could lead to higher research and development costs and production costs for us. A failure
to comply with applicable emissions standards may lead to significant fines, vehicle recalls, the suspension of sales and third-
party claims and may adversely affect our reputation. We are particularly exposed to the risk of such penalties, given our sale
of light vehicles in markets where regulations on fuel consumption are very stringent, particularly in Europe. In addition, the
harmful effects of atmospheric pollutants, including greenhouse gases, on ecosystems and human health have become an area
of major public concern and media attention. As a result, we may suffer significant adverse reputational consequences, in
addition to penalties, in the event of non-compliance with applicable regulations.

The number and scope of regulatory requirements, along with the costs associated with compliance, are expected to
increase significantly in the future, particularly with respect to vehicle emissions. These costs could be difficult to pass
through to consumers, particularly if consumers are not prepared to pay more for lower-emission vehicles. For a further
discussion of the regulations applicable to us, see the section “Stellantis Overview—Environmental and Other Regulatory
Matters” in this report. For example, EU regulations governing passenger car and LCV fleet average CO, emissions have
recently become significantly more stringent, imposing material penalties if targets are exceeded. The increased cost of
producing lower-emitting vehicles may lead to lower margins and/or lower volumes of vehicles sold. Given the significant
portion of our sales in Europe, our vehicles will be particularly exposed to such regulatory changes, as well as other European
regulatory developments (including surcharges), which may have a serious impact on the number of cars we sell in this
region and therefore on our profitability.

In 2019 the EPA withdrew the Clean Air Act waiver that allowed California to enforce its own GHG standards for
cars and light-duty trucks and its zero emission vehicle ("ZEV") standards. The EPA announced in April 2021 that it is
reconsidering its withdrawal of the waiver and in early to mid-2022 the EPA is expected to issue a decision to reinstate
California’s legal right to have and enforce its GHG and ZEV programs. In addition, NHTSA is undertaking a review of
national fuel economy standards. Uncertainty regarding these regulations, and the outcome of these proceedings, may
increase our costs of compliance. Furthermore, some of our competitors may be capable of responding more swiftly to
increased regulatory requirements, or may bear lower compliance costs, thereby strengthening their competitive position
compared to ours. See “The automotive industry is highly competitive and cyclical, and we may suffer from those factors
more than some of our competitors”.

Most of our suppliers face similar environmental requirements and constraints. A failure by our suppliers to meet
applicable environmental laws or regulations may lead to a disruption of our supply chain or an increase in the cost of raw
materials and components used in production and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

We remain subject to ongoing diesel emissions investigations by several governmental agencies and to a number of related
private lawsuits, which may lead to further claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions, and result in additional penalties,
settlements or damage awards and may also adversely affect our reputation with consumers.

On January 10, 2019, FCA US announced it had reached final settlements on civil, environmental and consumer
claims with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(“DoJ”), the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”), the State of California, 49 other States and U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, for which we accrued €748 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately €350 million of the
amount accrued by FCA US, which was prior to the merger, was related to civil penalties to resolve differences over diesel
emissions requirements. A portion of the amount accrued, prior to the merger, was attributable to settlement of a putative
class action on behalf of consumers in connection with which FCA US agreed to pay an average of $2,800 per vehicle to
eligible customers affected by the recall. That settlement received final court approval on May 3, 2019. On April 9, 2021,
FCA US reached an agreement with substantially all of the approximately 3,200 consumers that exercised their right to opt
out of the class action settlement to settle their claims for an amount that is not material to the Company. As of December 31,
2021, our best estimate of a probable loss is reflected in the amount previously accrued prior to the merger.

105


--- Page 97 ---

In the U.S., we remain subject to a diesel emissions-related investigation by the DoJ, Criminal Division. In
September 2019, the DoJ filed criminal charges against an employee of FCA US for, among other things, fraud, conspiracy,
false statements and violations of the Clean Air Act primarily in connection with efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the
vehicles that were the subject of the civil settlements described above. In April 2021, two additional employees of a Stellantis
subsidiary were indicted by the DoJ on similar charges. The three employees were placed on administrative leave following
their indictments. We have continued discussions with the DoJ, Criminal Division to determine whether we can reach an
appropriate resolution of their investigation as it relates to FCA US. Resolution of the investigation may involve the payment
of penalties and other non-financial sanctions. While the outcome of these discussions is uncertain and we cannot predict
whether or when any settlement may be reached with the DoJ, Criminal Division, or the ultimate outcome of its investigation,
prior to the merger, we accrued approximately €200 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as our best
estimate of probable loss with regard to matters under discussion. In light of subsequent progress in our discussions with the
DoJ, Criminal Division, we have increased our accrual for this matter to approximately €266 million, which reflects our best
estimate at this time. We also remain subject to a number of related private lawsuits (the “Non Opt-Out Litigation”).

We have also received inquiries from other regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions as they examine the
on-road tailpipe emissions of several automakers’ vehicles and, when jurisdictionally appropriate, we continue to cooperate
with these governmental agencies and authorities.

In Europe, we have continued to work with the Italian Ministry of Transport (“MIT”) and the Dutch Vehicle
Regulator (“RDW”), the authorities that certified FCA diesel vehicles for sale in the European Union, and the UK Driver and
Vehicle Standards Agency in connection with their review of several diesel models.

We also responded to inquiries from the German authority, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (“KBA”), regarding emissions
test results for FCA diesel vehicles, and discussed the KBA reported test results, our emission control calibrations and the
features of the vehicles in question. After these initial discussions, the MIT, which has sole authority for regulatory
compliance of the vehicles it has certified, asserted its exclusive jurisdiction over the matters raised by the KBA, tested the
vehicles, determined that the vehicles complied with applicable European regulations and informed the KBA of its
determination. Thereafter, mediations were held under European Commission (“EC”) rules, between the MIT and the
German Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, which oversees the KBA, in an effort to resolve their differences.
The mediation concluded and no action was taken with respect to FCA. In May 2017, the EC announced its intention to open
an infringement procedure against Italy regarding Italy's alleged failure to respond to EC's concerns regarding certain FCA
emission control calibrations. The MIT responded to the EC's allegations by confirming that the vehicles' approval process
was properly performed. On December 2, 2021, the EC notified Italy of its position that Italy did not comply with its
obligation to enforce EU emission type approval rules.

In December 2019, the MIT notified FCA of communications with the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water
Management (“I&W”) regarding certain irregularities allegedly found by the RDW and the Dutch Center of Research TNO in
the emission levels of certain Jeep Grand Cherokee Euro 5 models and a vehicle model of another OEM containing a Euro 6
diesel engine supplied by FCA. In January 2020, the Dutch Parliament published a letter from the I&W summarizing the
conclusions of the RDW regarding those vehicles and engines and indicating an intention to order a recall and report their
findings to the Public Prosecutor, the EC and other Member States. FCA engaged with the RDW to present our positions and
cooperate to reach an appropriate resolution of this matter. FCA proposed certain updates to the relevant vehicles that have
been tested and approved by the RDW and are now being implemented. Nevertheless, this matter is still pending.

In addition, as part of the judicial investigation of several automakers in France, commencing in 2016 and 2017,
Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroén were placed under examination by the Judicial Court of Paris in June 2021 on
allegations of consumer fraud in connection with the sale of Euro 5 diesel vehicles in France between 2009 and 2015. In July
2021, FCA Italy was placed under examination by the same court for possible consumer fraud in connection with the sale of
Euro 6 diesel vehicles in France between 2014 and 2017. FCA Italy was also designated as a material witness in connection
with allegations of obstruction of the actions of an economy ministry antifraud inspector in 2016 and 2017. As is typical in a
French criminal inquiry, each of the companies were required to pay bail for the potential payment of damages and fines and
to ensure representation in court, and to provide a guarantee for the potential compensation of losses. None of these amounts
were, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company.

106


--- Page 98 ---

In July 2020, unannounced inspections took place at several of FCA’s sites in Germany, Italy and the UK at the
initiative of the Public Prosecutors of Frankfurt am Main and of Turin, as part of their investigations of potential violations of
diesel emissions regulations and consumer protection laws. We have also responded to limited inquiries from the Public
Prosecutor of Frankfurt relating to PSA vehicles and a PSA engine. We continue to cooperate with these investigations.

Several former FCA companies and our Dutch dealers have also been served with a purported class action filed in
the Netherlands by a Dutch foundation seeking monetary damages and vehicle buybacks in connection with alleged
emissions non-compliance of certain diesel vehicles. We are aware of similar claims in Portugal and the Netherlands
regarding PSA vehicles, and the UK regarding vehicles of our brands (both FCA and PSA). We have also received notice of
a purported securities class action in the Netherlands, alleging misrepresentations by FCA, now Stellantis. We are defending
approximately 6,000 individual consumer claims alleging emissions non-compliance of certain former FCA vehicles in
Germany. We are also defending a small number of similar claims in Austria.

In December 2018, the Korean Ministry of Environment (“MOE”) announced its determination that approximately
2,400 FCA vehicles imported into Korea during 2015, 2016 and 2017 were not emissions compliant and that the vehicles
with a subsequent update of the emission control calibrations voluntarily performed by FCA, although compliant, would have
required re-homologation of the vehicles concerned. In May 2019, the MOE revoked certification of the above-referenced
vehicles and announced an administrative fine for an amount not material to the Company. Our appeal of the MOE’s decision
was rejected and we are now pursuing jurisdictional appeals. In November 2021, the MOE issued notice of its intention to
impose a recall order, revocation of certification and an administrative fine on the basis of the alleged non-compliance of
approximately 2,400 other FCA vehicles. Our subsidiary in Seoul, Korea is also cooperating with local criminal authorities in
connection with their review of these matters and is appealing a decision of the Korean Fair Trade Commission imposing an
administrative fine for a purported breach of the Act on Fair Labeling and Advertisement in connection with the vehicles
imported into Korea between 2015 and 2017.

The results of the unresolved governmental inquiries and private litigation cannot be predicted at this time and these
inquiries and litigation may lead to further enforcement actions, penalties or damage awards, any of which may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that these matters and
their ultimate resolution may adversely affect our reputation with consumers, which may negatively impact demand for our
vehicles and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business operations and reputation may be impacted by various types of claims, lawsuits, and other contingencies.

We are involved in various disputes, claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to several
matters, including product liability, warranty, vehicle safety, emissions and fuel economy, product performance, asbestos,
personal injury, dealers, suppliers and other contractual relationships, alleged violations of law, environment, securities,
labor, antitrust, intellectual property, tax and other matters. We estimate such potential claims and contingent liabilities and,
where appropriate, record provisions to address these contingent liabilities. The ultimate outcome of the legal proceedings
pending against us is uncertain, and such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations. Furthermore, additional facts may come to light or we could, in the future, be subject to judgments or
enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, not all claims or potential losses
can be covered by insurance, and even if claims could be covered by insurance, we may not be able to obtain such insurance
on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such
claims. Further, publicity regarding such investigations and lawsuits, whether or not they have merit, may adversely affect
our reputation and the perception of our vehicles with retail customers, which may adversely affect demand for our vehicles,
and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For example, in November 2019, General Motors LLC and General Motors Company (collectively, “GM”’) filed a
lawsuit against FCA US, FCA N.V., now Stellantis N.V., and certain individuals, claiming violations of the RICO Act, unfair
competition and civil conspiracy in connection with allegations that FCA US made payments to UAW officials that corrupted
the bargaining process with the UAW and as a result FCA US enjoyed unfair labor costs and operational advantages that
caused harm to GM. GM also claimed that FCA US had made concessions to the UAW in collective bargaining that the
UAW was then able to extract from GM through pattern bargaining which increased costs to GM and that this was done by
FCA US in an effort to force a merger between GM and FCA N.V.. For more information regarding the GM litigation, refer
to Note 26, Guarantees granted, commitments and contingent liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this report.

In addition, we and other Brazilian taxpayers have had significant disputes with the Brazilian tax authorities
regarding the application of Brazilian tax law. We believe that it is more likely than not that there will be no significant
impact from these disputes. However, given the current economic conditions and uncertainty in Brazil, new tax laws or more
significant changes such as tax reform may be introduced and enacted. Changes to the application of existing tax laws may
also occur or the realization of accumulated tax benefits may be limited, delayed or denied. Any of these events could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For additional risks regarding certain proceedings, see “We remain subject to ongoing diesel emissions investigations
by several governmental agencies and to a number of related private lawsuits, which may lead to further claims, lawsuits and
enforcement actions, and result in additional penalties, settlements or damage awards and may also adversely affect our
reputation with consumers”.

We face risks related to quality and vehicle safety issues, which could lead to product recalls and warranty obligations that
may result in direct costs, and any resulting loss of vehicle sales could have material adverse effects on our business.

Our performance is, in part, dependent on complying with quality and safety standards, meeting customer
expectations and maintaining our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality vehicles. Given the global
nature of our business, these standards and expectations may vary according to the markets in which we operate. For
example, vehicle safety standards imposed by regulations are increasingly stringent. In addition, consumers’ focus on vehicle
safety may increase further with the advent of autonomous and connected cars. If we fail to meet or adhere to required
vehicle safety standards, we may face penalties, become subject to other claims or liabilities or be required to recall vehicles.

The automotive industry in general has experienced a sustained increase in recall activity to address performance,
compliance or safety-related issues. For example, in 2021, we voluntarily recalled more than 246,000 Ram Heavy Duty and
Chassis Cab pickup trucks to replace fuel pumps because of wear that can lead the vehicle to stall or prevent it from stalling.
Our costs related to vehicle recalls could increase in the future.

Recall costs substantially depend on the nature of the remedy and the number of vehicles affected and may arise
many years after a vehicle’s sale. Product recalls may also harm our reputation, force us to halt the sale of certain vehicles
and cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. Given the intense regulatory activity across the
automotive industry, ongoing compliance costs are expected to remain high. Any costs incurred, or lost vehicle sales,
resulting from product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if
we face consumer complaints, or receive information from vehicle rating services that calls into question the safety or
reliability of one of our vehicles and we do not issue a recall, or if we do not do so on a timely basis, our reputation may also
be harmed and we may lose future vehicle sales. We are also obligated under the terms of our warranty agreements to make
repairs or replace parts in our vehicles at our expense for a specified period of time. These factors, including any failure rate
that exceeds our assumptions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to corruption and bribery, as well as stakeholder expectations relating to
human rights in the supply chain and a failure to meet these legislative and stakeholder standards could lead to
enforcement actions, penalties or damage awards and may also adversely affect our reputation with consumers.

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to corruption and bribery, including those of the U.S., the United
Kingdom and France, which have an international reach and which cover the entirety of our value chain in all countries in
which we operate. We also have significant interactions with governments and governmental agencies in the areas of sales,
licensing, permits, regulatory, compliance, environmental matters and fleet sales among others. A failure to comply with laws
and regulations relating to corruption and bribery may lead to significant penalties and enforcement actions and could also
have a long-term impact on our presence in one, or more, of the markets in which such compliance failures have occurred.

In addition, our customers may have expectations relating to the production conditions and origin of the products
they purchase. Therefore, it is important for us to seek to demonstrate transparency across the entire supply chain, which may
result in additional costs being incurred. A failure by us, or any of our suppliers or subcontractors, to comply with
employment or other production standards and expectations may result in adverse consequences to our reputation, disruptions
to our supply chain and increased costs as a result of remedial measures needing to be undertaken to meet stakeholder
expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which may harm our business.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our
intellectual property rights, others may be able to compete against us using intellectual property that is the same as or similar
to our own. In addition, there can be no guarantee that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to provide us with a
competitive advantage against others who offer products similar to our products. For example, another OEM has produced a
vehicle closely resembling one of our Jeep models for sale in the U.S. We have brought proceedings to stop these practices,
and rulings have been in our favor enjoining import and sale of the vehicle in the U.S. In response, the OEM has created a
redesigned model, and has received rulings that the redesign does not infringe the Jeep model trade dress. We believe legal
error was made in these rulings and are seeking to enjoin this practice as well through the appeal process, but cannot be
certain of the final outcome. More generally, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing
our intellectual property and using our technology for their competitive advantage. Any such infringement could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The laws of some countries in which we operate do not offer the same protection of intellectual property rights as do
the laws of the U.S. or Europe. In addition, effective intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or limited in
certain countries, making it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement there. Our inability to
protect our intellectual property rights in some countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

It may be difficult to enforce U.S. judgments against us.

We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and a substantial portion of our assets are outside of the U.S.
Most of our directors and senior management and our independent auditors are resident outside the U.S., and all or a
substantial portion of their respective assets may be located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for U.S. investors
to effect service of process within the U.S. upon these persons. It may also be difficult for U.S. investors to enforce within the
U.S. judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any state thereof. In addition,
there is uncertainty as to whether the courts outside the U.S. would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained
against us or our directors and officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any
state thereof. Therefore, it may be difficult to enforce U.S. judgments against us, our directors and officers and our
independent auditors.

As an employer with a large workforce, we face risks related to the health and safety of our employees, as well as
reputational risk related to diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity.

We employ a significant number of people who are exposed to health and safety risks as a result of their employment.
Working conditions can cause stress or discomfort that can impact employees’ health and may result in adverse consequences
for our productivity. In addition, as an automotive manufacturer, a significant number of our employees are shift workers in
production facilities, involving physical demands which may lead to occupational injury or illness. The use or presence of
certain chemicals in production processes may adversely affect the health of our employees or create a safety risk. As a result,
we could be exposed to liability from claims brought by current or former employees and our reputation, productivity,
business, financial condition and results of operations may be affected.

Our stakeholders are expected to place increased emphasis on the importance of diversity, inclusion and equal
opportunity in the workplace, against a backdrop of developing legal requirements in these areas. We may suffer adverse
effects on our reputation if we fail to meet our stakeholders’ expectations, which could result in an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could
have an adverse effect on our business and the value of our common shares.

Effective internal controls, enable us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent
fraud. While we have devoted, and will need to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to
complying with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as amended (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), there is no assurance that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur or that we
will be successful in adequately remediating any such material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. Furthermore, as we
transform our business, our internal controls may become more complex, and we may require significantly more resources to
ensure internal controls remain effective.

Prior to the closing of the merger, PSA was not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s requirements to design and
maintain and to report on its internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we are redesigning and integrating the
internal control over the financial reporting framework for PSA operations. If we are unable to establish and implement
effective internal controls over these operations in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or if we otherwise fail to
maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, this could have an adverse
effect on our business and reputation, and we may be subject to investigation by regulatory authorities. This could also result
in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may in turn have an adverse
effect on the value of our common shares.

Given the size, complexity and magnitude of the merger, management concluded there was insufficient time to
complete its assessment of the internal control over financial reporting related to PSA, and, therefore, PSA internal control
over financial reporting was excluded from our report on internal control over financial reporting. Focusing on those controls
that relate exclusively to ongoing FCA operations, the evaluation undertaken by management and our independent registered
public accountants pursuant to Section 404 concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2021.

Risks Related to Our Liquidity and Existing Indebtedness

Limitations on our liquidity and access to funding, as well as our significant outstanding indebtedness, may restrict our
financial and operating flexibility and our ability to execute our business strategies, obtain additional funding on
competitive terms and improve our financial condition and results of operations.

Our performance depends on, among other things, our ability to finance debt repayment obligations and planned
investments from operating cash flow, available liquidity, the renewal or refinancing of existing bank loans and/or facilities
and possible access to capital markets or other sources of financing. Our indebtedness may have important consequences on
our operations and financial results, including:

110


--- Page 102 ---

* we may not be able to secure additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements or general corporate purposes;

* we may need to use a portion of our projected future cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on
our indebtedness, which may reduce the amount of funds available to us for other purposes, including product
development; and

* — we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, which may make us more vulnerable to a
downturn in general economic conditions or our business.

The COVID-19 pandemic put significant pressure on FCA’s and PSA’s liquidity, leading to an increase in our overall
level of indebtedness, which could increase the aforementioned risks. In addition, while our credit ratings are investment
grade, any deterioration of our credit ratings may significantly affect our funding and prospects.

We could, therefore, find ourselves in the position of having to seek additional financing or having to refinance
existing debt, including in unfavorable market conditions, with limited availability of funding and a general increase in
funding costs. In addition, should a general increase in market borrowing rates arise because of current inflationary pressures,
the cost of our future debt may increase. Any limitations on our liquidity, due to a further decrease in vehicle shipments, the
amount of, or restrictions in, our existing indebtedness, conditions in the credit markets, our perceived creditworthiness,
general economic conditions or otherwise, may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies and impair our
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actual or perceived limitations of our liquidity may limit the
ability or willingness of counterparties, including dealers, consumers, suppliers, lenders and financial service providers, to do
business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be exposed to shortfalls in our pension plans which may increase our pension expenses and required
contributions and, as a result, could constrain liquidity and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations.

Certain of our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded. For example, as of December 31, 2021, our
defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by approximately €4.2 billion and may be subject to significant minimum
contributions in future years. Our pension funding obligations may increase significantly if the investment performance of
plan assets does not keep pace with benefit payment obligations. Mandatory funding obligations may increase because of
lower than anticipated returns on plan assets, whether as a result of overall weak market performance or particular investment
decisions, changes in the level of interest rates used to determine required funding levels, changes in the level of benefits
provided for by the plans, or any changes in applicable law related to funding requirements. Our defined benefit plans
currently hold significant investments in equity and fixed income securities, as well as investments in less liquid instruments
such as private equity, real estate and certain hedge funds. Due to the complexity and magnitude of certain investments,
additional risks may exist, including the effects of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market capacity to
complete a particular investment strategy and an inherent divergence in objectives between the ability to manage risk in the
short term and the ability to quickly re-balance illiquid and long-term investments.

To determine the appropriate level of funding and contributions to our defined benefit plans, as well as the
investment strategy for the plans, we are required to make various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan
assets and a discount rate used to measure the obligations under defined benefit pension plans. Interest rate increases
generally will result in a decline in the value of investments in fixed income securities and the present value of the
obligations. Conversely, interest rate decreases will generally increase the value of investments in fixed income securities and
the present value of the obligations. See Note 2, Basis of preparation-Significant accounting policies—Employee benefits
within the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

Any reduction in the discount rate or the value of plan assets, or any increase in the present value of obligations, may
increase our pension expenses and required contributions and, as a result, could constrain liquidity and materially adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to make required minimum funding contributions to our
U.S. pension plans, it could be subject to reportable event disclosure to the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, as
well as interest and excise taxes calculated based upon the amount of any funding deficiency.

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Shares

Our maintenance of three exchange listings may adversely affect liquidity in the market for our common shares and result
in pricing differentials of Stellantis common shares between the three exchanges.

Our common shares are currently traded on the NYSE, Euronext Milan and Euronext Paris. The tripartite listing of
our common shares may adversely affect the liquidity of the shares in one or several markets. In addition, the tripartite listing
of our common shares may result in price differentials between the exchanges. Differences in the trading schedules, as well
as volatility in the exchange rate of the trading currencies, among other factors, may result in different trading prices for our
common shares on the three exchanges.

Our loyalty voting structure may concentrate voting power in a small number of our shareholders and such concentration
may increase over time.

Shareholders who hold our common shares for an uninterrupted period of at least three years may elect to receive one
special voting share in addition to each common share held, provided that such shares have been registered in the Loyalty
Register upon application by the relevant holder. If our shareholders holding a significant number of common shares for an
uninterrupted period of at least three years elect to receive special voting shares, a relatively large proportion of voting power
could be concentrated in a relatively small number of shareholders who would have significant influence over Stellantis. As a
result, the ability of other shareholders to influence decisions would be reduced.

The loyalty voting structure may affect the liquidity of our common shares and reduce our share price.

Our loyalty voting structure could reduce the liquidity of our common shares and adversely affect the trading prices
of our common shares. The loyalty voting structure is intended to reward our shareholders for maintaining long-term share
ownership by granting persons holding shares continuously for at least three years the option to elect to receive special voting
shares. Special voting shares cannot be traded and, immediately prior to the transfer of our common shares from the Loyalty
Register, any corresponding special voting shares will be transferred to us for no consideration (om niet). This loyalty voting
structure is designed to encourage a stable shareholder base and, conversely, it may deter trading by those shareholders who
are interested in gaining or retaining special voting shares. Therefore, the loyalty voting structure may reduce liquidity in our
common shares and adversely affect their trading price.

The loyalty voting structure may prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to change our management and hinder
efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common shares may be lower as a result.

Our loyalty voting structure may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of
us, even if a change of control were considered favorably by shareholders holding a majority of our common shares. As a
result of the loyalty voting structure, a relatively large proportion of voting power could be concentrated in a relatively small
number of shareholders, which may make it more difficult for third parties to seek to acquire control of us by purchasing
shares that do not benefit from the additional voting power of the special voting shares. The possibility or expectation of a
change of control transaction typically leads to higher trading prices and conversely, if that possibility is low, trading prices
may be lower. The loyalty voting structure may also prevent or discourage shareholders’ initiatives aimed at changing our
management.

Resales of Stellantis common shares following the merger may cause the market value of Stellantis common shares to
decline.

Several reference shareholders of Stellantis are subject to restrictions on share sales for a three-year period following
the merger, but will be free to sell once those restrictions expire. Furthermore, Dongfeng, which owned 3.17 percent of our
issued common shares as of February 22, 2022, is not subject to any resale restrictions on its Stellantis common shares. All
other shareholders, which own the majority of our common shares, are not subject to any resale restrictions. The resale of
such shares in the public market from time to time, particularly on the part of Dongfeng, or on the part of any reference
shareholder following expiration of the lock-up, or the perception that such resales may occur could have the effect of
depressing the market value for Stellantis common shares.

Risks Related to Taxation

The French tax authorities may deny, revoke or disregard in whole or in part the rulings confirming the neutral tax
treatment of the merger for former PSA and the transfer of tax losses carried forward by the legacy PSA French tax
consolidated group.

Several tax ruling requests have been granted by the French tax authorities regarding certain tax consequences of the
merger.

In particular, the French tax authorities have confirmed that the merger will fulfill the conditions to benefit from the
favorable corporate income tax regime set forth in Article 210 A of the French Tax Code (which mainly provides for a
deferral of taxation of the capital gains realized by PSA as a result of the transfer of all its assets and liabilities pursuant to the
merger).

Such tax regimes and tax rulings are subject to certain conditions being met and are based on certain declarations,
representations and undertakings given by us to the French tax authorities. If the French tax authorities consider that the
relevant declarations, representations, conditions or undertakings were not correct or are not complied with, they could
revoke or disregard the rulings that have been granted in respect of the merger.

In addition, as required by law, a tax ruling request has also been filed with the French tax authorities in order to
allow for the transfer of a large majority of the French tax losses carried forward of the former PSA French tax consolidated
group to our French permanent establishment and for the carry-forward of French tax losses transferred to our French
permanent establishment against future profits of our French permanent establishment and certain companies of the former
PSA French tax consolidated group pursuant to Articles 223 I-6 and 1649 nonies of the French Tax Code. As of the date of
this report, this ruling has not yet been granted by the French tax authorities but, subject to the approval of the French tax
authorities, a large portion of PSA’s French tax losses are expected to be preserved.

If the French tax authorities consider that the applicable conditions to allow for the transfer of French tax losses
carried forward of the former PSA French tax consolidation are not fulfilled, the French tax authorities could deny the benefit
of such transfer and therefore refuse to grant the requested ruling or agree on a partial transfer only. If this ruling is granted,
the French tax authorities could also revoke or disregard this ruling on the basis that the relevant declarations, representations
and undertakings are not correct or complied with or if the conditions provided under French tax law are not met.

A decision by the French tax authorities to deny, revoke or disregard the tax rulings in the future would likely result
in significant adverse tax consequences to us that could have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial
position. If the requested tax rulings are denied or revoked, the main adverse tax consequences for us would be that (i) all
unrealized capital gains at the level of former PSA at the time of the merger would be taxed; and (ii) the tax losses carried
forward at the level of former PSA would not be transferred to our French permanent establishment or would be forfeited.

We operate so as to be treated exclusively as a resident of the Netherlands for tax purposes after the transfer of our tax
residency to the Netherlands, but the tax authorities of other jurisdictions may treat us as also being a resident of another
jurisdiction for tax purposes.

Since we are incorporated under Dutch law, we are considered to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch corporate
income tax and Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes. In addition, with effect from January 17, 2021 and taking into
account the sanitary restrictions and limitations applicable under the current COVID-19 crisis, we have operated so as to
maintain our management and organizational structure in such a manner that we (i) should be regarded to have our residence
for tax purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, withholding tax and tax treaty eligibility purposes) exclusively in the
Netherlands, (ii) should not be regarded as a tax resident of any other jurisdiction (and in particular of France or Italy) either
for domestic law purposes or for the purposes of any applicable tax treaty (notably any applicable tax treaty with the
Netherlands) and (iii) should be deemed resident only in the Netherlands, including for the purposes of the France-
Netherlands and Italy-Netherlands tax treaties. We also hold permanent establishments in France and Italy.

However, the determination of our tax residency primarily depends upon our place of effective management, which is

a question of fact based on all circumstances. Because the determination of our residency is highly fact sensitive, no
assurance can be given regarding the final determination of our tax residency.

113


--- Page 105 ---

If we were concurrently resident in the Netherlands and in another jurisdiction (applying the tax residency rules of
that jurisdiction), we may be treated as being tax resident in both jurisdictions, unless such other jurisdiction has a double tax
treaty with the Netherlands that includes either (i) a tie-breaker provision which allocates exclusive residence to one
jurisdiction only or (ii) a rule providing that the residency needs to be determined based on a mutual agreement procedure and
the jurisdictions involved agree (or, as the case may be, are compelled to agree through arbitration) that we are resident in one
jurisdiction exclusively for treaty purposes. In the latter case, if no agreement is reached in respect of the determination of the
residency, the treaty may not apply and we could be treated as being tax resident in both jurisdictions.

A failure to achieve or maintain exclusive tax residency in the Netherlands could result in significant adverse tax
consequences to us, our subsidiaries and our shareholders and could result in tax consequences for our shareholders that
differ from those described in the section entitled “Taxation”. The impact of this risk would differ based on the views taken
by each relevant tax authority and, in respect of the taxation of shareholders and holders of special voting shares, on the
specific situation of each shareholder or each holder of special voting shares.

We may not qualify for benefits under the tax treaties entered into between the Netherlands and other countries.

With effect from January 17, 2021, and taking into account the sanitary restrictions and limitations applicable under
the current COVID-19 crisis, we operate in a manner such that we should be eligible for benefits under the tax treaties
entered into between the Netherlands and other countries, notably France, Italy and the U.S. However, our ability to qualify
for such benefits depends upon (i) being treated as a Dutch tax resident for purposes of the relevant tax treaty, (ii) the
fulfillment of the requirements contained in each applicable treaty as modified by the Multilateral Convention to Implement
Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (including, but not limited to, any principal purpose
test clause) and applicable domestic laws, (iii) the facts and circumstances surrounding our operations and management and
(iv) the interpretation of the relevant tax authorities and courts.

Our failure to qualify for benefits under the tax treaties entered into between the Netherlands and other countries
could result in significant adverse tax consequences to us, our subsidiaries and our shareholders and could result in tax
consequences for our shareholders that differ from those described in the section entitled “Taxation”.

The tax consequences of the Loyalty Voting Structure are uncertain.

No statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the receipt, ownership, or disposition of
special voting shares should be treated for French, Italian, UK, or U.S. tax purposes, and as a result, the tax consequences in
those jurisdictions are uncertain.

In addition, the fair market value of the special voting shares, which may be relevant to the tax consequences, is a
factual determination and is not governed by any guidance that directly addresses such a situation. Because, among other
things, the special voting shares are not transferable and a shareholder will receive amounts in respect of the special voting
shares only if we are liquidated, we believe and intend to take the position that the value of each special voting share is
minimal. However, the relevant tax authorities could assert that the value of the special voting shares as determined by us is
incorrect, which could result in significant adverse tax consequences to shareholders holding special voting shares.

The tax treatment of the loyalty voting structure is unclear and shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors in
respect of the consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of special voting shares. See “Taxation” for further
discussion.

There may be potential Passive Foreign Investment Company tax considerations for U.S. Shareholders.

We would be a “passive foreign investment company” (a ““PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect
to a U.S. shareholder (as defined in ““Taxation—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences’’) if for any taxable year in
which such U.S. shareholder held our common shares, after the application of applicable “look-through rules” (i) 75% or
more of our gross income for the taxable year consists of “passive income” (including dividends, interest, gains from the sale
or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated
parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business, as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations), or (ii) at
least 50% of our assets for the taxable year (averaged over the year and determined based upon value) produce or are held for
the production of “passive income”.

114


--- Page 106 ---

U.S. persons who own shares of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with
respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the dividends they receive from the PFIC, and the gain, if any, they derive from
the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC.

In particular, if we were treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year during which a
U.S. shareholder owned our common shares, then any gain realized by the U.S. shareholder on the sale or other disposition of
our common shares would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead, a U.S. shareholder would be treated as if it had
realized such gain ratably over its holding period for our common shares. Amounts allocated to the year of disposition and to
years before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income and amounts allocated to each other taxable year would
be taxed at the highest tax rate applicable to individuals or corporations, as appropriate, in effect for each such year to which
the gain was allocated, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. Similar treatment
may apply to certain “excess distributions” as defined in the Code.

While we believe our common shares are not stock of a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, this conclusion is
a factual determination made annually and thus may be subject to change. Moreover, we may become a PFIC in future
taxable years if there were to be changes in our assets, income or operations. In addition, because the determination of
whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC is primarily factual and because there is little administrative or judicial authority on
which to rely to make a determination, the IRS may take the position that we are a PFIC. See “Taxation” for a further
discussion.

The IRS may not agree with the determination that we should not be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and adverse tax consequences could result to us and our shareholders if the IRS were to successfully
challenge such determination.

Section 7874 of the Code provides that, under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. corporation will be treated as a U.S.
“domestic” corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In particular, certain mergers of foreign corporations with U.S.
subsidiaries can, in certain circumstances, implicate these rules.We do not believe we should be treated as a U.S. “domestic”
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the relevant law is not entirely clear, is subject to detailed but
relatively new regulations (the application of which is uncertain in various respects, and whose interaction with general
principles of U.S. tax law remains untested) and is subject to various other uncertainties. Therefore, the IRS could assert that
we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant
to Code Section 7874. In addition, changes to Section 7874 of the Code or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, or interpretations thereof, could affect our status as a foreign corporation. Such changes could potentially have
retroactive effect.

If the IRS successfully challenged our status as a foreign corporation, significant adverse tax consequences would
result for us and for certain of our shareholders. For example, if we were treated as a domestic corporation in the U.S., we
would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our worldwide income as if we were a U.S. domestic corporation, and
dividends we pay to non-U.S. shareholders would generally be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, among other adverse
tax consequences. If we were treated as a U.S. domestic corporation, such treatment could materially increase our U.S.
federal income tax liability.

The closing of the merger was not conditioned on our not being treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes or upon a receipt of an opinion of counsel to that effect. In addition, neither former FCA nor former PSA
requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, while we do
not believe we will be treated as a domestic corporation, no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree, or that if it
challenges such treatment, it will not succeed.

If we fail to maintain a permanent establishment in France, we could experience adverse tax consequences..
We maintain a permanent establishment in France to which the assets and liabilities of former PSA were allocated
upon the merger for French tax purposes. However, no assurance can be given regarding the existence of a permanent

establishment in France and the allocation of each asset and liability to such permanent establishment because such
determination is highly fact sensitive and may vary in case of future changes in our management and organizational structure.

If we were to fail to maintain a permanent establishment in France, the main adverse tax consequences would be that
(i) all unrealized capital gains at the level of the permanent establishment at that time would be taxed and (ii) the tax losses
carried forward that may still be available at that time would be forfeited. In addition, if, in the future, any of former PSA’s
assets and liabilities cease to be allocated to such establishment, this may result in (i) Stellantis being taxed in France on
unrealized capital gains or profits with respect to the assets and liabilities deemed transferred outside of France and (ii) a
portion of the tax losses carried forward that may still be available at that time being forfeited.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws and treaties of numerous jurisdictions. Future changes to such laws or
treaties could adversely affect us and our subsidiaries and our shareholders and holders of special voting shares. In
addition, the interpretation of these laws and treaties is subject to challenge by the relevant governmental authorities.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws, regulations and treaties in the Netherlands, France, Italy, the U.S. and
the numerous other jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate. These laws, regulations and treaties could change on
a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such change could adversely affect us and our subsidiaries and our shareholders
and holders of special voting shares.

Furthermore, these laws, regulations and treaties are inherently complex and we and our subsidiaries will be
obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws, regulations and treaties to us and our
subsidiaries and our operations and businesses. The interpretation and application of these laws, regulations and treaties could
differ from that of the relevant governmental authority, which could result in administrative or judicial procedures, actions or
sanctions, which could be material.
