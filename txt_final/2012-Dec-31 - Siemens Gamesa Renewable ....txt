1. EVOLUTION OF THE COMPANY DURING THE YEAR

COMPLIANCE WITH 2012 TARGETS‘AND LAUNCH OF THE BUSINESS PLAN 2013-2015
ORIENTED TOWARDS PROFITABLE PERFORMANCE AND CREATION OF VALUE IN AN
ENVIRONMENT OF LOWER GROWTH

In a complex financial environment and operating in a highly competitive market, Gamesa
Corporacion Tecnolégica” ended 2012 with normalised financial results in line with the
committed guidelines for the year: 2,119 MWe, a positive normalised EBIT for the group and
wind turbines® and a net financial debt totalling EUR 495 million, after generating EUR 690
million in net free cash flow over the latest quarter of the year and EUR 216 million during the
year. The Group's net profit has nevertheless been impacted by special items for a net total of
EUR 600 million, which is the result of the alignment of the Company's balance sheet to the
new market reality and to the business plan 2013-2015, a plan that was presented and
implemented during the fourth quarter of 2012.

Main consolidated figures for’ 2012
o Sales: EUR 2,844 million (-6.2% y/y)
o Normalised EBIT: EUR 5 million
o Net recurring profit EUR -59 million
o Special items: EUR 600 million (net amount)
co Net profit: EUR -659 million
o Net Financial Debt: EUR 495 million
Main Wind Turbine figures 2012
o MWe sold: 2,119 (-24.4% a/a)
o Recurring EBIT margin: 0.9%
© Orders® signed in 4Q 2012: 571 MW
o Order book at 31/12/2012: 1,657 MW

Group sales totalled EUR 2,844 million, 6.2% less than 2011 sales, result of the strategy of
aligning manufacturing to deliveries and collections in the wind turbine activity, in an
environment of declining demand. This slowdown is due to the weakness of developed economies
and to regulatory changes and network limitations in emerging markets such as India and China. Wind
turbines ended to the year with a sales volume of 2,119 MWe, 24% lower than the volume in 2011. To
the contrary, the operations and maintenance segment grew, despite the weak economic
environment, attaining sales totalling EURO 344 million, 23% higher than 2011 sales and ended 2012
at 19,111 MW under maintenance, 17% higher than the NW under maintenance in December 2011

REPORT

(16,300 MW). As a result, total sales of wind turbines fell by 13% year-on-year to EUR 2,492
million.

In a complex market in which demand is expected to decline in 2013, the commercial diversification
strategy continues to give positive results with the signature of firm contracts for delivery in 2013
and future years for a total of 571 MW during the fourth quarter of 2012, raising the total number of
orders received during the year totalling 2,176 MW. This allows ending the year with a firm portfolio
of 1,657 MW, 4% higher than the portfolio in December 2011 and with a coverage of sales volume
2013 exceeding 50%. In this connection, it should be noted that the Company's solid position in
growth markets, especially in Latin America, which contributes 47% to the order volume received
during the year and which is becoming the main growth motor for global demand for wind turbines
over the next three years. This position has allowed the partial offset of the decline in orders from
markets such as China, India and Europe, whose joint contribution reached 71% of total orders
received in 2011.

MANAGEMENT
REPORT

Among sales activity in 2012, the signing of the first contract for a multi-MW platform is notable:
four 4.5 MW G128 units for the Simo plant in Finland. This contract also gives rise to the Company's
entry into the Finnish market, reinforcing Gamesa's commercial presence in the north of Europe. The
sales contract includes a 10-year operations and maintenance (O&M) agreement, extendable for a
urther 5 years, and a framework agreement for the sale of an additional 117MW of G128-4.5MW. Part
of this framework agreement will materialise in firm orders before the end of 2012 for 54MW to be
delivered in 2013/2014.

The reduction of the wind turbine activity, together with continuous price pressures, and the cost of
launching new 2 MW and multi-MW platforms have had a clear impact on the Divisions
profitability, which has lost 3% in recurring EBIT margin during the year. Wind turbines thus
ends the year with a recurring EBIT of EUR 22 million, equivalent to a 0.9% margin. However, the
quarterly evolution shows a positive trend, reflecting the initial impact of the cost savings measures
that were put into place over the course of the year. The EBIT margin in the fourth quarter of 2012
thus reached 3.3% of sales and exceeds the margin in the fourth quarter of 2011 by 1%, as may be
seen in the accompanying graph.

The profitability of Plants also suffered an impairment in the markets in which it operates,
especially in the United States and countries in Southern Europe, ending 2012 with recurring
operating losses of EUR 48 million. These losses arose despite the significant increase in the
activity with deliveries of 694 MW in 2012, almost 4 times more than the deliveries in 2011. The
deterioration of the market has been especially significant in the United States, a market without which
Gamesa Energia would have generated a recurring EBIT of EUR 25 million in 2012.

This deterioration of the market conditions in the United States, due to low gas prices and regulatory
volatility, has led Gamesa to interrupt its activity and sell its development business in that market and
this activity is now classified as an asset held-for-sale with a carrying value of EUR 104 million.
However, Gamesa maintains its wind turbine manufacturing and sales operations and O&M services
in the United States.

Evolution of gas prices in the future and the volatility of demand support the decision to
abandon the promotion and development activity in the United States.

As a result of the impact of the weakness and complexity of the market on the profits of Wind Turbines
and Plants, Gamesa Corporacién Tecnoldgica ends 2012 with a normalised EBIT, before
extraordinary items, of EUR 5 million, significantly lower than the EBIT attained in 2011.

In order to regain the path towards profitability and the creation of value in a market with slower
growth, and after the creation in the first half of 2012 of a new management team with extensive
industrial experience in the automobile sector, Gamesa defines a new business plan for the
coming three years, BP 2013- 2015. This plan started to be implemented during the fourth quarter of
2012, during which material advances were made in two areas of the plan: financial deleveraging
and resizing of the operating structure.

As regards financial deleveraging, and in line with the commitments acquired, Gamesa ends 2012
with net financial debt totalling EUR 495 million after generating EUR 690 million in net cash flow
in the fourth quarter, EUR 216 million in 2012, and complying with bank covenants.

The strong cash generation is supported by a material reduction of working capital for both Wind
Turbines and Plants and on investment controls, all in line with the operating strategy included in the
new business plan.

Wind Turbines reduced its working capital as a ratio of sales by up to 12%, compared with the
24% at which 2011 ended and the 27% seen in the third quarter of 2012. This reduction was the
result, among other things, of a level of installations (2,625 MW) and deliveries (2,495 MW) that
exceeded the level of MWe sold. The Plants unit delivered 694 MW in 2012, compared with 177 MW.
delivered in 2011, and 440 MW were delivered during the fourth quarter of 2012, and its working
capital fell to EUR 188 million® compared with EUR 670 million in 2011 and EUR 784 million
during the third quarter of 2012.

As part of the strategy of focusing investments in accordance with the size of the business and the
need to optimise the cost of energy to benefit customers, Gamesa ended 2012 with investments is
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totalling EUR 190 million, 17% less than
the investments made in 2011. This investment plan includes the adaptation of the manufacturing
capacity to the new 2 MW and 4.5 MW platforms, the development of an industrial presence in India
and Brazil or the development of the first offshore prototype.

Expected development of the Group’s NFD

° Working capital of Gamesa Energia before discontinuing operations in the United States. The share capital of
Energia after discontinuing the plant promotion and sale activity in the United States totals EUR 158 million.

As part of the resizing of the business’ operating structure in accordance with an efficient business
model and a market with slower growth, Gamesa has implemented measures to reduce costs, with
a scope of 90% of the target established for 2013. The agreements reached during the fourth
quarter in all geographic areas to adapt the payroll and outside personnel to the new size of the
business. These agreements lead to a reduction of 1,418 jobs in the fourth quarter and 2,218 in 2012,
and these reductions are associated with gross annualised savings of EUR 98 million’, and with a
restructuring expense totalling EUR 24 million. In addition, the R&D resources have been
concentrated in Spain and multidisciplinary teams have been created to integrate with technological
and quality teams in manufacturing units, thereby improving their operating excellence.

The launch of the BP 2013-2015, has also required an adaptation of the Company's balance sheet
to the new size of the organisation, the new operating model and product strategy, and also a
market with slower growth. This adaptation has translated into a series of balance sheet
adjustments with a net total impact on the income statement of EUR 600 million. The breakdown,
which is explained in the financial section, is set out below.

(43%), a position which, together with the existing lines of financing totalling EUR 2,200 million will
allow the Company to organically implement the plan, without any need to carry out share capital
increases.

MANAGEMENT
REPORT

Gamesa thus ended 2012 complying with the normalised targets indicated to the market - a
sales volume of 2,119 MWe, positive Group and Wind Turbine EBIT and a NFD of EUR 495 million,
2.5x the Group's EBITDA -, thereby complying with the bank covenants and setting the
foundation for the implementation of the new BP 2013-2015.

Wind Turbines
Main Factors

Gamesa's 2012 profits are a reflection of the complex environment affecting the wind energy
sector, with a reduction of demand and price pressure in the markets that historically have had
the highest potential for the development of wind energy.

Gamesa's Wind Turbine unit ended 2012 with:

e¢ 2,119 MWe of Wind turbines sold, above the guidance (2,000 MW) although 24% less than
in 2011.

e Arecurring EBIT totalling EUR +22 million (0.9% of sales), as a result of the lower volume
(less absorption of fixed costs) and price pressure. The EBIT taking into consideration
restructuring costs was EUR -498 million

« and working capital was 12% of sales, less than the figure seen in 2011 (24%) and market
guidance (15-20%), as a result of a reduction of inventories, the management of receivables
and payables and the impact of write-downs

Wind Turbine activity in 2012 breaks down as follows:

MWe sold 2,802 | 2,119 | -24%

The significant reduction in MW under degree of completion arrangements in 2012 is notable (-
192 MW vs. 2011), as a result of an increased focus on the policy of aligning production to deliveries
and to assembly and project launch milestones.

As Gamesa has been announcing, the Company has a solid diversification of sales:

.

Latin America and South America is presented as the region with the highest
contribution to sales (32%), becoming the primary growth motor for the activity (Mexico,
Brazil, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Puerto Rico)

USA represents 20% of total sales in the period, mainly associated with the sale
agreement concluded by Gamesa Energia with Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp

Europe and the rest of the world contributes 27% to sales, mainly driven by the deliveries
during the second half of the year in Italy and the United Kingdom

As Gamesa has been announcing, the contribution made by China and India to sales in
2012 is impacted by the lengthening of the process for approving wind energy projects
and to changes in the energy incentives in India, accompanied by an increase in the cost of
financing in that country. China thus represents only 10% of sales, while India contributes
12%.

China 23% 10%

India 19% 12%

Latin and South America 15% 32%

Europe and rest of the world 29% 27%

TOTAL 100% 100%
Furthermore, Gamesa's 2.0 MW segment as a whole represents 88% of the MWe sold in 2012

compared with 79% in 2011. Gamesa's 850 KW platform contributes 11% to the MWe sold.

Audited figures

Sales in 2012 underwent a -13% decline with respect to 2011, with an increase in average revenue
per MW as a result of the geographic mix of sales, the growing weight of the Gamesa 2 MW platform,
the launch of the G97-2 MW turbine and the wider scope of the projects with a higher weight of
projects involving civil works. The contribution of the Services Unit to sales was EUR 344 million

compared with EUR 279 million in 2011.

Gamesa ends 2012 with recurring operating results (EBIT) during the period totalling EUR 22
million. Compared with 2011, the EBIT fell as a result of less activity (less absorption of fixed

MANAGEMENT
REPORT

costs), price and cost pressure associated with the industrialisation of new products, partially
offset by a reduction in fixed costs and productivity improvements. Considering the restructuring
costs recognised in 2012, EBIT amounted to EUR -498 million. There has been a progressive
recovery of the recurring EBIT margin over the course of 2012, and the ratio was 3.3% in 4Q in
2012 vs. 2.2% in 4Q 2011, as a result of the plan to reduce fixed costs launched through the Strategic
Plan 2013-2015.

The provision for warranties (excluded special effects) remains at around 3.5% of wind turbine
sales.

Gamesa ends 2012 with working capital at 12% of sales, which is lower than in 2011 (24%),
mainly as a result of the reduction of inventories (finished products, raw materials, services),
the management of payments made and received during the period and the impact of the write-
downs recorded in 4Q.

In addition, Gamesa continues to focus on strict control of its investments and the solidity of
the Company's balance sheet. Gamesa thus invested EUR 190 million, less than in the same period
of 2011 (EUR 229 million)

Gamesa focuses investments in 2012:

o Investment in R&D associated with new products and platforms (G97-2.0 MW, G114-2.0
MW, Gamesa 4.5 MW and offshore)

o Blade plant in India for the Gamesa 850 KW and Gamesa 2 MW platforms.
o Adaptation of production capacity to the G97-2.0 MW.
o Investment associated with the manufacture of the Gamesa 4.5 MW platform.

o Implementation in Brazil

Thus, Gamesa ends 2012 with net financial debt totalling EUR 243 MM in the Wind Turbine area,
which is EUR 322 million in 4Q, associated with the containment of the level of working capital and the
investments recorded during the year.

Wind Farms
Main Factors

During 2012, Gamesa delivered 694 MW in Germany, France, Poland, Spain, USA and Mexico.
In addition, the Plant Promotion and Sale Unit concluded new sales agreements for a total of 555 MW
during the period in the United States, Mexico, France, Greece, Spain and Germany.

At December 2012 Gamesa's portfolio of wind energy plants totals 18,168 MW throughout the
world.

MANAGEMENT
REPORT

During the fourth quarter of 2012 promotions have been written-down, mainly in the United States and
in Spain due to the regulatory changes approved in those countries. These write-downs, together with
the 694 MW in deliveries, explain the change in the portfolio of energy plants during the year.

Gamesa maintains in its portfolio 400 MW in the final stages of construction and launch,
significantly less than the figure recorded in 2011 as a result of the new business model implemented
by Gamesa Energia (no consumption of financing).

It should be noted that of the total MW with PEM (287 MW), 176 MW relate to assets for sale in the

USA, 78 MW to plants in Europe + RoW (with more than 40% of the plants with the final
customer) and 33 MW in R&D plants.

Results for wind energy plants in 2012

The results of the wind energy plant unit in 2012 reflect:
e Ahigh level of activity (694 MW delivered)
e¢ The impact of the change in market conditions, especially in the United States and
southern Europe in
o Profitability of sales agreements in 2012.
o Non-recurring provisions valued at EUR 111 million.
o Discontinuation of Gamesa Energia USA as a result of the low gas prices and
regulatory volatility.

In this connection, the Wind Energy Plant Promotion and Sale unit ends 2012 with sales
totalling EUR 996 million and recurring EBIT of EUR -48 million (considering Gamesa Energia
USA as a continuing operation), and the losses derive from the deterioration of conditions
mentioned above. Considering the restructuring costs, EBIT amounted to EUR -144 million.

Excluding the contribution of Gamesa Energia USA, the Wind Energy Plant Promotion and Sale
unit recognised sales in 2012 totalling EUR 418 million and recurring EBIT of EUR 25 million.

The new operating model for Gamesa Energia without consumption of financing (using external
financing vehicles and payment milestones that are similar to the sale of machinery) has had a
positive effect on the evolution of working capital and debt. The Wind Energy Plant Promotion
and Sale Unit ends 2012 with net financial debt of EUR 252 million, in line with the annual forecast
and much lower than the debt recorded in 3Q 2011 (EUR 620 million) and at the end of 2011 (EUR
438 million)

Special items

In the context of a complex environment current affecting the world economy in general and the wind
energy industry in particular, which gives rise to lower growth expectations, on 25 October Gamesa
presented a new Business Plan for the period 2013-2015. Among other things, the aforementioned
business plan contemplates the following measures, with an effect on the consolidated financial
statements:

- Rationalization of fixed expenses. Lower fixed expense structure by reducing payroll which
allows for a structural size that is in line with the market situation and eliminate inefficiencies, as
well as the closing of offices and service centres.

- Adaptation of the currently oversized production capacity to projected demand, at least in
the short and medium term, and to the new platforms and the new product range, in line with
existing and projected demand in the market. This orientation could mean the closing of
manufacturing centres after 2012, taking into account the evolution of demand and the local
regulatory requirements.

- Development of the “Make/Buy” strategy applied to all components as a basis for the industrial
proposal through which the external supply of capital intensive components (such as the blades)
will accelerate.

- Strategy of new manufacturing processes, among which the process of manufacturing blades
through fibreglass injection is notable.

- Product strategy, consisting of two basic platforms, to address the evolution of the 2 MW to
2.5MW and the 4.5MW to the 5.5MW platforms. The latter has common elements for "on-shore"
and "off-shore" platforms.

- New model to reduce inventories of work in progress and finished products and the
optimisation of inventories of raw materials, as well as the inventory associated with
Operations and Maintenance as a result, among other things, of the change in the mix of sales
towards higher added value services. There will be a definitive reduction in working capital that will
make it possible to strengthen the balance sheet.

- Discontinuation of the development and sale of wind energy plants in the United States due
to the regulatory uncertainty and volatility in that country, within the framework of the new strategic
orientation of the Energy business model that gives rise to a focus on key markets and sales
channels that do not consume financing.

- Maximum utilization of the supply and manufacturing chains in Spain and China, with a
continuous focus on improving competitiveness in both operations and the assembly of nacelles in
all key regions.

The objectives and action plans deriving from the above considerations have had an impact on
certain assets forming part of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and
other items.

In addition, although not directly linked to the New Business Plan, in 2012 there have been regulatory
changes (i.e. Spain) that have had an impact on the Group's assets and certain events and projects
in progress, which have required a series of provisions for guarantees and other risks.

2. FORESEEABLE DEVELOPMENT

Outlook

During 2013 Gamesa will continue to work on all of the aspects established in its business plane,
oriented towards attaining profitable performance in an environment of lower growth.

During the first quarter of 2013, Gamesa expects to complete the launch of the measures to
adjust fixed costs oriented towards attaining a gross reduction of EUR 100 million in 2013 compared
with the fixed costs in 2011 or EUR 386 million. During January and February 2013 Gamesa has
continued with the measures to reduce the payroll and external personnel already planned and which
have resulted in the termination of 278 employees, mainly at Gamesa USA. Gamesa ended the
month of February with 6,432 employees, 28% less than at the end of 2011.

9 additional centres were also closed and overheads were reduced by renegotiating leases and
relocating to lower-cost premises. Gamesa also started to optimise warehouses into a single
logistics headquarters.

The launch of 100% of the fixed cost reduction measures during the first quarter of 2013 should not,
however, be understood to be a closed process. The size of the structure in the future is subject to
the evolution of market and demand conditions, and it is possible to define new measures
provided that they are necessary to recover the profitability established in the plan.

As part of the programme to optimise variable costs, which is key to attaining operating excellence,
Gamesa will focus its efforts on the supply chain and on internal manufacturing processes in
2013. The scope of the 2 MW platform cost improvement programme (9/15) exceeds initial
expectations, which will help to offset the continues pressure on prices. The latest Bloomberg
New Energy Finance prices corroborates the opinion of Gamesa regarding a lack of visibility regarding
the short and long-term development of demand and continuous pressure on prices. Compared with
the index prepared in July 2012, prices fell by 4% and they are now 27% below the peak price attained
in 2008. Similarly, the upward pressure momentarily applied to the new platforms seems to have
become a slight decline for deliveries during the second half of 2013, as may be seen in the
accompanying graph.

MANAGEMENT
REPORT

As part of the supply chain, Gamesa develops multi-pronged actions in order to decrease
manufacturing/purchase costs for large components. Among these actions are the exchange of
technological and manufacturing knowledge with strategic suppliers in order to reduce the
internal and external manufacturing cost. Gamesa is also diversifying its supplier base to low cost
markets, while maintaining its quality requirements. This is also allowing the group to not only directly
reduce the cost of supplies, but also indirectly by increasing the negotiating power of the most
established suppliers.

The process of manufacturing blades using an injection process, with estimated savings to be
25% in 2015, has already been launched in India, and the manufacture of the new products in
Europe with planned delivery in 2013 and 2014 is being planned based on the new process.

As part of the design for manufacturing strategy, Gamesa has also developed a new tower
design that allows a material reduction in the weight/cost of the tower by up to 10% -12% in
2015.

Finally, new transport and tooling systems are being defined that are necessary to offset the higher
cost of logistics due to commercial diversification and the increased complexity of the projects.

The second pillar of BP 2013-2015, after operating excellence, is to maintain a presence in the entire
wind energy value chain, whose objective is to optimise the cost of energy through technological
leadership, and this area has advanced as planned. In January, the new business model for the
wind energy plant promotion and development activity, obtained a principal of agreement for
the development of 183 MW in Germany, and this agreement is expected to be finalised in a firm
contract over the coming months.

In the Wind Turbine division, the development of new products based on two platforms 2-2.5 and 5.5-
5x is intended to provide a higher TIR/VAN to our customers and has also advanced as planned, as
shown in the accompanying product map tables.

During the attainment of the objective to optimise our customer's cost of energy (better project
TIR/VAN), the multi-MW 5-5.5 MW platform plays a fundamental role, especially in Northern Europe:

. Markets with space limitations,

. Markets in which initial development has been carried out for the Multi-MW platform.
. Refurbishing markets without network limitations,

. Markets in which higher towers are necessary (forest areas)

The evolution of the operating and maintenance service unit continues to be aligned with the
business plan and the objective of increasing the contribution of added value products and
higher margins whose benefits revert to both the customer and Gamesa. Although the post-warranty
retention rate remains at 76%, there has been an improvement in the latest contracts, and the
maintenance periods also increases. In this connection, the 264 MW maintenance contract in the
United States or the sales contracts for the multi-MW platform contracts in December 2012 (72 MW in
total) are notable, which include 10-year O&M contracts and a possible 5-year extension in the case of
the multi-MW platform.

While the internal action covered by the plan develop in accordance with Company projections,
Gamesa maintains its perspectives for demand during the period, which is 12% lower than
2013, as a result of the US market situation and a recovery in 2014.

Emerging markets became the motor of growth in demand for wind energy facilities in the
period 2013-2015. It should be noted that the demand from these markets is not due to environmental
commitments but rather to an energy need that the current generation systems do not cover or to the
need to reduce dependence on a single resource. In this connection and as is shown in the
accompanying table, the average 10% energy shortfall in India or the situation in Brazil, which is totally
dependent on hydroelectric production (70% of the country's capacity) or in China, which is largely
dependent on coal, should be noted. In addition, several of these countries have sufficiently strong
wind resources to make wind energy more competitive, in many cases, than gas, as is the case in
certain regions of Mexico and Brazil.

Gamesa is among the top manufacturers in both Brazil, Mexico and India by volume
of accumulated installations in December, a market share and position that is
expected to be reinforced during 2012, based on the portfolio of firm projects and
those under discussion.

i. Mexico (1 with 46% of the market)
ii. India (4 with 10% of the market)

iii. Brazil ( 9% of installations in 2012)

This position, together with a diversified commercial presence has allowed Gamesa to end the year
with a stable order book (+4 year-on-year) in a declining demand environment (-12% expected in
2013). This, and the solid advances made with respect to the fixed cost reduction measures and the
improvement of variable costs, allow the targets established in the 2013 business plan to be
confirmed, despite the complexity and uncertainty that characterises the market.

MANAGEMENT
REPORT

Conclusions

Gamesa ends 2012 with a solid position to develop the actions set out in the Business Plan
2013-2015 without any need to seek additional financing, with net financial debt of EUR 495
million, complying with the bank covenants and with access to EUR 2,200 million in financing.

The plan is advancing in accordance with plans from the launch in the fourth quarter of 2012, and
the action that is necessary to attain EUR 100 million in fixed cost savings, 2013 vs. 2011. In
December 2012 2,218 internal and external employees had left and in January and February 2013 a
further 278 positions were eliminated, resulting in a total internal and payroll reduction of 28%
compared with that which existed at the start of 2012. Together with a reduction in employees, 33
centres had been closed, consisting of offices, O&M centres and manufacturing plants, at the
presentation date, and leases have been renegotiated and operations were located. Similarly, and as
was announced during the presentation of the BP 2013-2015, R&D resources have been grouped
together in Spain and multi-disciplinary teams have been created and are key to attaining operating
excellence.

The scope of improvements in the variable costs for the 2 MW platform exceeds initial
projections, with the objective of obtaining a 5% annual improvement up to 2015. This increased
scope should allow Gamesa to maintain its objectives relating to improving the contribution margin
established for 2015, despite the continued price pressure.

Together with the pillars of operating excellence, specified in the reduction of fixed costs and the
optimisation of variable costs, an a solid balance sheet, demonstrated by the financial deleveraging,
Gamesa has also advanced with respect to defined changes in its manner of operating throughout the
wind energy value change with the launch of the new wind energy plant model, without consuming
inancing, the launch of new product 2-2.5 MW and 5-5.5 MW platforms and the emphasis on new
value added O&M contracts.

Finally, it is important to note the importance of the commercial diversification strategy implemented in
BP 2011-2013 and the Company's presence in emerging markets, especially in Latin America. These
are the factors that have allowed Gamesa to end 2012 with an order book covering 1,657 MW, 4%
higher than the order book in December 2011, despite the slowdown of demand and with target
sales volume for 2013 being covered by more than 50%. This coverage and the progress with
respect to savings of fixed costs support the confidence regarding the attainment of the
objectives established for the year, despite the complexity of the market.

3. MAIN BUSINESS RISKS

Gamesa Group is exposed to certain financial risks that it manages by grouping together risk
identification, measurement, concentration limitation and oversight systems. Gamesa's Corporate
Division and the business units coordinate the management and limitation of financial risks through
the policies approved at the highest executive level, in accordance with the established rules, policies
and procedures. The identification, assessment and hedging of financial risks are the responsibility of
each business unit.

The risk associated with changes in exchange rates assumed for Gamesa's transactions involve the
purchase and sale of products and services relating to its activity that are denominated in various

currencies.

To mitigate this risk, Gamesa has obtained financial hedging instruments from financial institutions.

4. USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Gamesa Group uses financial hedges that allow it to mitigate risks involving exchange rates, interest
rates, and equity volatility that could affect the Company's estimated results based on estimates of
expected transactions in its various areas of activity.

5. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

We refer to Note 37 of the Consolidated Notes to the Annual Accounts and Note 21 of the Notes to the
Individual Annual Accounts.

6. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

Technological development is established within a multi-year framework that is rolled out in the Annual
Technological Development Plan, in which activities and deliverables are established for each year in
question and to which a budget is finally assigned.

In 2012 the main addition to “Research and Development Expenditure” under intangible assets was
due to the development by Gamesa Innovation and Technology, S.L. of new wind turbine models and
to the optimisation of the performance of their components amounting, in total for the entire Group, to
approximately EUR 74,904 thousand (approximately EUR 68,112 thousand in 2011):

During 2012, and within the framework of the new Business Plan 2013-2015 (Note 1 of the Notes to
the Consolidated accounts), there have been significant changes of a marked technological character,
among other things, regarding the new strategic orientation for the evolution of the new products and
platforms such as new manufacturing processes. This change, both in products and technology, gave
tise to Gamesa having recorded EUR 127 million for impairment, recorded under the heading "Net
asset impairment losses" in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2012.

he aforementioned impairment fundamentally relates to those development expenses incurred to
date and specifically to projects relating to a certain Multi-MW blade design and off-shore platforms up
until the business plan (Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Notes to the Accounts).

7. TREASURY SHARE OPERATIONS

At 31 December 2012 Gamesa maintains a total of 3,098,208 treasury shares representing 1.22% of
share capital.

The total cost for these treasury shares totals EUR 7,157 thousand, each with a par value of EUR
2.310.

A more detailed explanation of transactions involving treasury shares is set out in Note 18 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 12.c of the Notes to the Individual Financial
Statements).
