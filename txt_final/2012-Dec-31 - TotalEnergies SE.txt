Business overview
History and strategy of TOTAL

1. History and strategy of TOTAL

1.1. History and development

TOTAL S.A., a French société anonyme (limited company)
incorporated in France on March 28, 1924, together with its
subsidiaries and affiliates, is the fifth largest publicly-traded
integrated international oil and gas company in the world").

With operations in more than 130 countries, TOTAL has activities
in every sector of the oil industry: including in the upstream (oil and
gas exploration, development and production, liquefied natural gas)
and downstream (refining, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals,

the trading and shipping of crude oil and petroleum products,
marketing). In addition, TOTAL has equity stakes in coal mines and
operates in the power generation and renewable energy sectors.

1.2. Strategy

TOTAL's activities lie at the heart of the two biggest challenges
facing the world now and in future: energy supply and environmental
protection. The Group's responsibility as an energy producer

is to provide optimum, sustainable management of these

twin imperatives.

TOTAL's strategy, the implementation of which is based on a model
for sustainable growth combining the acceptability of operations
with a sustained, profitable investment program, aims at:

- expanding hydrocarbon exploration and production activities
and strengthening its worldwide position as one of the global
leaders in the natural gas and LNG markets;

(1) Based on market capitalization (in dollars) as of December 31, 2012.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

TOTAL began its Upstream operations in the Middle East in 1924.
Since that time, the Company has grown and expanded its
operations worldwide. In early 1999, the Company acquired control
of PetroFina S.A. (hereafter referred to as “PetroFina” or “Fina”) and
in early 2000, the Company acquired control of Elf Aquitaine S.A.
(hereafter referred to as “Elf Aquitaine” or “Elf”).

The Company's Corporate name is TOTAL S.A.

The Company's registered office is 2, place Jean Millier, La Défense 6,
92400 Courbevoie, France.

The telephone number is +33 1 47 44 45 46 and the website
address is total.com.

TOTAL S.A. is registered in France at the Nanterre Trade Register
under the registration number 542 051 180.

progressively expanding energy solutions and developing
new energies to complement oil and gas;

adapting its refining and petrochemical base to market changes,
focusing on a small number of large, competitive platforms and
maximizing the advantages of integration;

developing its petroleum product marketing business, in
particular in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, while maintaining
the competitiveness of its operations in mature areas; and

pursuing research and development to develop “clean” sources
of energy, contributing to the moderation of the demand for
energy, and participating in the effort against climate change.

2. Upstream segment

TOTAL's Upstream segment includes the activities of Exploration
& Production and Gas & Power. The Group has exploration and
production activities in more than fifty countries and produces

oil or gas in approximately thirty countries. Gas & Power conducts
activities downstream from production related to natural gas,
liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),

as well as power generation and trading, and other activities.

Effective July 1, 2012, the Upstream segment no longer includes
the activities of New Energies, which are now reported with
Marketing & Services. As a result, certain information has been
restated according to the new organization.

* 2.3 Mboe/d of hydrocarbons produced in 2012

For the full year 2012, adjusted net operating income from

the Upstream segment was €11,186 million compared with
€10,602 million in 2011, an increase of 6%. Expressed in dollars,
adjusted net operating income from the Upstream segment

was $14.4 billion, a decrease of 3% compared with 2011, explained
mainly by the decrease in hydrocarbon production, since the
increase in technical costs (as discussed below) was largely offset
by the decrease in the effective tax rate for the Upstream segment.

Business overview
Upstream

2.1. Exploration & Production

2.1.1. Exploration and development

TOTAL's Upstream segment aims at continuing to combine long-term
growth and profitability at the level of the best in the industry.

TOTAL evaluates exploration opportunities based on a variety of
geological, technical, political and economic factors (including taxes
and license terms), and on projected oil and gas prices. Discoveries
and extensions of existing fields accounted for approximately 77%
of the 2,016 Mboe added to the Upstream segment's proved
reserves during the three-year period ended December 31, 2012
(before deducting production and sales of reserves in place and
adding any acquisitions of reserves in place during this period).

The remaining 23% comes from revisions of previous estimates.
The level of revisions during this three-year period was significantly
impacted by the effects of the increase of the reference oil price
(from $59.91/b in 2009 to $111.13/b in 2012 for Brent crude)

and the decrease of the U.S. onshore gas price (from $4.21/MBtu
in 2011 to $2.85/MBtu in 2012 for Henry Hub), which together
induced a substantial negative revision.

In 2012, the exploration investments of consolidated subsidiaries
amounted to €2,634 million (including exploration bonuses
included in the unproved property acquisition costs). Exploration
investments were made primarily in Angola, the United Kingdom,
the United States, Norway, lraq, Nigeria, Brazil, Malaysia, the
Republic of Congo and French Guiana. In 2011, the exploration
investments of consolidated subsidiaries amounted to €1,629 million
(including exploration bonuses included in the unproved property
acquisition costs). The main exploration investments were made in
Norway, the United Kingdom, Angola, Brazil, Azerbaijan, Indonesia,
Brunei, Kenya, French Guiana and Nigeria. In 2010, the exploration
investments of consolidated subsidiaries amounted to €1,472 million
(including exploration bonuses included in the unproved property
acquisition costs) notably in Angola, Norway, Brazil, the United
Kingdom, the United States, Indonesia, Nigeria and Brunei.

The Group's consolidated Exploration & Production subsidiaries’
development investments amounted to €14 billion in 2012, primarily
in Angola, Norway, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, the United Kingdom,
Gabon, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, the Republic of the Congo, the
United States and Russia. The Group's consolidated Exploration

& Production subsidiaries’ development investments amounted to
€10 billion in 2011, primarily in Angola, Nigeria, Norway, Kazakhstan,
the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Gabon, Indonesia, the
Republic of the Congo, the United States and Thailand. The Group's
consolidated Exploration & Production subsidiaries’ development
investments amounted to €8 billion in 2010, mostly in Angola, Nigeria,
Kazakhstan, Norway, Indonesia, the Republic of the Congo, the United
Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Thailand, Gabon and Australia.

2.1.2. Reserves

The definitions used for proved, proved developed and proved
undeveloped oil and gas reserves are in accordance with the
United States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 4-10
of Regulation S-X as amended by the SEC Modernization of Oil
and Gas Reporting release issued on December 31, 2008. Proved
reserves are estimated using geological and engineering data to
determine with reasonable certainty whether the crude oil or natural
gas in known reservoirs is recoverable under existing regulatory,
economic and operating conditions.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

TOTAL's oil and gas reserves are consolidated annually, taking

into account, among other factors, levels of production, field
reassessments, additional reserves from discoveries and acquisitions,
disposal of reserves and other economic factors. Unless otherwise
indicated, any reference to TOTAL's proved reserves, proved
developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves and production
reflects the Group's entire share of such reserves or such
production. TOTAL's worldwide proved reserves include the proved
reserves of its consolidated subsidiaries as well as its proportionate
share of the proved reserves of equity affiliates. For further
information concerning changes in TOTAL's proved reserves

for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, see
“Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)” in Chapter 10.

The reserves estimation process involves making subjective
judgments. Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact
measurements and are subject to revision under well-established
control procedures.

The reserves booking process requires, among other things:

— internal peer reviews of technical evaluations to ensure
that the SEC definitions and guidance are followed; and

- that management makes significant funding commitments
towards the development of the reserves prior to booking.

For further information regarding the preparation of reserves
estimates, see “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)”
in Chapter 10.

2.1.3. Proved reserves

In accordance with the amended Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X,
proved reserves for the years ended on or after December 31, 2009,
are calculated using a 12-month average price determined as the
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price
for each month of the relevant year unless prices are defined by
contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future
conditions. The reference prices for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were,
respectively, $111.13/b, $110.96/b, and $79.02/b for Brent crude.

As of December 31, 2012, TOTAL's combined proved reserves of
oil and gas were 11,368 Mboe (51% of which were proved developed
reserves). Liquids (crude oil, condensates, natural gas liquids and
bitumen) represented approximately 50% of these reserves and
natural gas the remaining 50%. These reserves were located in
Europe (mainly in Norway and the United Kingdom), in Africa
(mainly in Angola, Gabon, Libya, Nigeria and the Republic of the
Congo), in the Americas (mainly in Canada, Argentina and Venezuela),
in the Middle East (mainly in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and
Yemen), and in Asia (mainly in Australia, Kazakhstan and Russia).

As of December 31, 2011, TOTAL's combined proved reserves

of oil and gas were 11,423 Mboe (53% of which were proved
developed reserves). Liquids (crude oil, natural gas liquids and
bitumen) represented approximately 51% of these reserves

and natural gas the remaining 49%. These reserves were located
in Europe (mainly in Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom),

in Africa (mainly in Angola, Gabon, Libya, Nigeria and the Republic
of the Congo), in the Americas (mainly in Canada, the United States,
Argentina and Venezuela), in the Middle East (mainly in Qatar,

the United Arab Emirates and Yemen), and in Asia (mainly in
Australia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Russia).


--- Page 5 ---

As of December 31, 2010, TOTAL'’s combined proved reserves of oil
and gas were 10,695 Mboe (53% of which were proved developed
reserves). Liquids (crude oil, natural gas liquids and bitumen)
represented approximately 56% of these reserves and natural gas

the remaining 44%. These reserves were located in Europe

(mainly in Norway and the United Kingdom), in Africa (mainly in Angola,
Gabon, Libya, Nigeria and the Republic of the Congo), in the Americas
(mainly in Canada, the United States, Argentina and Venezuela),

in the Middle East (mainly in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates

and Yemen), and in Asia (mainly in Indonesia and Kazakhstan).

2.1.4. Sensitivity to oil and gas prices

Changes in the price used as a reference for the proved reserves
estimation result in non-proportionate inverse changes in proved
reserves associated with production sharing and risked service
contracts (which together represent approximately 25% of TOTAL’s
reserves as of December 31, 2012). Under such contracts, TOTAL
is entitled to a portion of the production, the sale of which is meant
to cover expenses incurred by the Group. As oil prices increase,
fewer barrels are necessary to cover the same amount of expenses.
Moreover, the number of barrels retrievable under these contracts
may vary according to criteria such as cumulative production, the rate
of return on investment or the income-cumulative expenses ratio.
This decrease is partly offset by an extension of the duration over
which fields can be produced economically. However, the increase
in reserves due to extended field life resulting from higher prices

is generally less than the decrease in reserves under production
sharing or risked service contracts due to such higher prices.

As a result, higher prices lead to a decrease in TOTAL's reserves.

Furthermore, changes in the price used as a reference for the proved
reserves estimation impact the volume of royalties in Canada and thus
TOTAL's share of proved reserves.

Lastly, for any type of contract, a decrease of the reference price
of petroleum products may involve a significant reduction of proved
reserves.

2.1.5. Production

For the full year 2012, average daily oil and gas production was
2,300 kboe/d compared to 2,346 kboe/d in 2011. Liquids accounted
for approximately 53% and natural gas for approximately 47%

of TOTAL's combined liquids and natural gas production in 2012.

The table on the next page sets forth by geographic area TOTAL’s
average daily production of liquids and natural gas for each of the
last three years.

Consistent with industry practice, TOTAL often holds a percentage
interest in its fields rather than a 100% interest, with the balance
being held by joint venture partners (which may include other
international oil companies, state-owned oil companies or government
entities). TOTAL frequently acts as operator (the party responsible
for technical production) on acreage in which it holds an interest.
See the table “Presentation of production activities by geographic area”
on the following pages for a description of TOTAL's producing assets.

Business overview y )
Upstream

As in 2011 and 2010, substantially all of the liquids production
from TOTAL's Upstream segment in 2012 was marketed by the
Trading & Shipping division of TOTAL's Refining & Chemicals
segment (see table “Trading division’s supply and sales of crude oil”
on paragraph 3.2.1. of the present Chapter).

The majority of TOTAL's natural gas production is sold under long
term contracts. However, its North American production, and part
of its production from the United Kingdom, Norway and Argentina,
is sold on the spot market. The long-term contracts under which
TOTAL sells its natural gas usually provide for a price related to,
among other factors, average crude oil and other petroleum product
prices, as well as, in some cases, a cost-of-living index. Though
the price of natural gas tends to fluctuate in line with crude oil
prices, a slight delay may occur before changes in crude oil prices
are reflected in long-term natural gas prices. Due to the interaction
between the contract price of natural gas and crude oil prices,
contract prices are not usually affected by short-term market
fluctuations in the spot price of natural gas.

Some of TOTAL's long-term contracts, notably in Argentina,
Indonesia, Nigeria, Norway, Qatar and Russia, specify the delivery
of quantities of natural gas that may or may not be fixed and
determinable. Such delivery commitments vary substantially, both
in duration and in scope, from contract to contract throughout

the world. For example, in some cases, contracts require delivery
of natural gas on an as-needed basis, and, in other cases, contracts call
for the delivery of varied amounts of natural gas over different periods
of time. Nevertheless, TOTAL estimates the fixed and determinable
quantity of gas to be delivered over the period 2013-2015 to be
4,070 Bcf. The Group expects to satisfy most of these obligations
through the production of its proved reserves of natural gas, with,

if needed, additional sourcing from spot market purchases (see
Chapter 10, “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)”
of this Registration Document).

Business overview
Upstream

2.1.7.1 Africa

In 2012, TOTAL’s production in Africa was 713 kboe/d,
representing 31% of the Group’s overall production,
compared to 659 kboe/d in 2011 and 756 kboe/d in 2010.

In Algeria, TOTAL's production was 23 kboe/d in 2012, compared
to 33 kboe/d in 2011 and 41 kboe/d in 2010. These declines

in production were mainly due to the sale in July 2011 of TOTAL's
48.83% share in CEPSA. All of the Group's production in Algeria
now comes from the Tin Fouyé Tabenkort (TFT) field (35%).
TOTAL also has stakes of 37.75% and 47% in the Timimoun

and Ahnet gas development projects, respectively.

- On the TFT field, plateau production was maintained at 170 kboe/d.

Pursuant to the ALNAFT national agency approval, at end 2010,
of the development plan, the Timimoun Group, the operator of
the development and the exploitation of the field, has been
created. The answers for the main tendering for the construction
of the facility are being processed. A 3D seismic survey has started
at year end 2012. Commercial gas production is scheduled to
start up by the end of 2016, with anticipated plateau production
of 1.6 Bm*/y (160 Mcf/d).

Under the Ahnet project, the technical section of a development
plan was submitted to the authorities in July 2011. Discussions
are underway with the project partners and the authorities.

The anticipated plateau production is 4 Bm%/y (400 Mcf/d)

as from the end of 2017.

In Angola, the Group's production was 179 kboe/d in 2012, compared
with 135 kboe/d in 2011 and 163 kboe/d in 2010. Production
comes mainly from Blocks 0, 14 and 17. Highlights of 2010

to 2012 included the launch of the CLOV project in August 2010,
the start-up of production on Pazflor in August 2011, several
discoveries on Blocks 15/06 and 17/06 and, finally, the acquisition
of interests in Blocks 25, 39 and 40 in the Kwanza basin.

— Deep-offshore Block 17 (40%, operator) is TOTAL's principal
asset in Angola. It is composed of four major zones: Girassol,
Dalia, Pazflor, which are all in production, and CLOV, which
is currently being developed.

Production on Pazflor, which comprises the Perpetua, Zinia,
Hortensia and Acacia fields and which started in August 2011,
was 196 kb/d in 2012.

The development of CLOV started in 2010 and will result in the
installation of a fourth floating production, storage and offloading
units (FPSOs) with a production capacity of 160 kb/d. Start-up
of production is expected in 2014.

On Block 14 (20%), production on the Tombua-Landana field
started in 2009 and adds to production from the Benguela-
Belize-Lobito-Tomboco and Kuito fields.

The development of the Lianzi (10%) field was approved in 2012.
Located in the offshore unitization zone between Angola and the
Republic of Congo, this field will be developed by

a connection with the existing Benguela-Belize-Lobito-Tomboco
platform (Block 14). Production start-up is expected in 2015.

On Block 0, the development of Mafumeira Sul (10%) was
approved by the partners and the authorities. This project is the
second phase of the development of the Mafumeira field.

The first oil is expected in 2015.

On the ultra-deep offshore Block 32 (30%, operator), exploration
work continues and the basic engineering studies are underway
for the Kaombo project. These studies are expected to permit
the development of the discoveries made in the southeast portion
of the block through two FPSOs with an estimated capacity

of 100 kb/d each. The calls for tender have been issued and

the final decision on investment should be made in 2013.

On Block 15/06 (15%), the development of a first production
hub including the discoveries located in the northwest portion
of the block began in early 2012.

TOTAL has operations on exploration Blocks 33 (65%, operator),
17/06 (30%, operator), 25 (35%, operator), 39 (15%) and 40 (50%,
operator). The Group plans to drill for pre-salt targets in Blocks 25,
39 and 40.

TOTAL is also developing in LNG through the Angola LNG project
(13.6%), which includes a gas liquefaction plant near Soyo. The plant
will be supplied in particular by the gas associated with production
from Blocks 0, 14, 15, 17 and 18. Construction work is now complete
and start-up is expected mid-2013.

In Cameroon, TOTAL finalized in April 2011 the sale of its entire 75.8%
stake in its Upstream subsidiary Total E&P Cameroun. Since that time,
the Group no longer owns any exploration or production assets in

the country. Production was 3 kboe/d in 2011 and 9 kboe/d in 2010.

In Céte d’lvoire, TOTAL is active in four deep offshore exploration
licenses.

TOTAL is the operator of the Cl-100 (60%) license and, since
February 2012, the Cl-514 (64%) license and also holds, since February
2012, a stake in the Cl-515 (45%) and Cl-516 (45%) licenses.

A comprehensive 3D seismic survey was conducted on the

Cl-100 license, and the first exploration drilling started at the
beginning of January 2013. The 2,000 km? license is located
approximately 100 km southeast of Abidjan in water depths

ranging from 1,500 m to 3,100 m.

A 3D seismic survey campaign, covering the whole of the three
licenses Cl-514, Cl-515 and Cl-516, was completed in December
2012. The data are currently being interpreted.

In Egypt, TOTAL signed a concession agreement in 2010 and became
operator of Block 4 (East El Burullus Offshore). In January 2013,
TOTAL sold a 40% interest in Block 4, but continues to operate

this license with a 50% stake. The license, located in the Nile river
basin where a number of gas discoveries have been made, covers
a 4-year initial exploration period and includes a commitment to carrying
out 3D seismic work and drilling exploration wells. Following the
3,374 km? 3D seismic survey shot in 2011, drilling is under preparation
and should start in 2013.

In Gabon, the Group's production was 57 kboe/d in 2012 compared
to 58 kboe/d in 2011 and 67 kboe/d in 2010. The Group's exploration
and production activities in Gabon are mainly carried out by Total

Gabon", one of the Group's oldest subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa.

— Under the Anguille field redevelopment project, the AGM North
platform, from which twenty-one additional development wells are
to be drilled, was installed in January 2012. The drilling campaign
started early in the second quarter of 2012 and production from
this platform, which should represent 20 kboe/d, is expected
to start in 2013.

(1) Total Gabon is a Gabonese company whose shares are listed on Euronext Paris. TOTAL holds 58.28%, the Republic of Gabon holds 25% and the public float is 16.72%.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012


--- Page 13 ---

- On the deep-offshore Diaba license, Total Gabon, the operator,
sold off in June 2012 part of its interest, which now stands
at 42.5%. A 6,000 km? 3D seismic survey was shot, processed
and interpreted in 2010. Initial exploration drilling is planned
for the first half of 2013.

Total Gabon farmed into the onshore Mutamba-lroru (50%),

DE7 (30%), and Nziembou (20%) exploration licenses in 2010.
Following negative exploration drilling on license DE7, Total Gabon
relinquished the license in 2011. After reprocessing the existing
seismic data, the Nguongui-updip well was drilled on the Mutamba-
lroru license in 2012 and revealed the presence of hydrocarbons.
The commercial viability of this discovery will be investigated
further. A 2D seismic survey was made on the Nziembou license
in 2012, and an exploration well is due to be drilled in 2014.

In Kenya, TOTAL acquired in September 2011 a 40% stake in five
offshore licenses in the Lamu basin (L5, L7, L11a, L11b and L12),
representing a total surface area of more than 30,600 km? in water
depths ranging from 100 m to 3,000 m. Following a 3,500 km? 3D
seismic survey in the initial exploration period, 25% of the surface area
of the five blocks has been relinquished and the decision was made to
drill two exploration wells in 2013 on Blocks L7 and L11b. In June 2012,
the Group also acquired the L22 offshore license (100%, operator),
located in the same basin and covering a surface area of more than
10,000 km? in water depths ranging from 2,000 m to 3,500 m.

In Libya, the Group's production was 62 kb/d in 2012, compared
to 20 kb/d in 2011 and 55 kb/d in 2010. TOTAL is present in

the following contract zones: 15, 16 & 32 (75%!"), 70 & 87 (75%!"),
129 & 130 (30%""), 130 & 131 (24%""), and Block NC 191
(100%), operator).

In 2012, production recovered the level preceding the events of 2011
in the country that had caused the interruption of production in late
February 2011.

- In offshore zones 15, 16 and 32, production resumed in September
2011 and quickly reached its former level. The drilling of two wells
is expected to start in the second quarter of 2013.

In onshore zones 70 and 87, production resumed in January 2012.
It gradually ramped back up to plateau level. In addition, the Group
is continuing the development of the Dahra and Garian fields,
where production is expected to start at the beginning of 2014.

In onshore zones 129, 130 and 131, production resumed in October
2011. A return to plateau level production occurred in 2012.

The seismic campaign started before the events and will be
pursued in 2013.

In the onshore Murzuk basin, following a successful appraisal
well drilled on the discovery made on a portion of Block NC 191,
a development plan was submitted to the authorities in 2009.
After the interruption related to the events of 2011 in the country,
discussions with the authorities have restarted.

In Madagascar, TOTAL acquired in 2008 a 60% stake in the
Bemolanga 3102 license (operator) to appraise the license’s oil
sand accumulations. The exploitation of oil sand accumulations

is no longer a consideration, TOTAL is focusing on exploration
for conventional hydrocarbons. The conventional exploration

of the block is expected to continue in 2013 with a 2D seismic
survey following the approval of an additional two-year extension
by the local authorities of the exploration phase.

(1) TOTALS stake in the foreign consortium.

Business overview
Upstream

In Mauritania, TOTAL has exploration operations on the Ta7 and Ta8
licenses (60%, operator) located in the Taoudenni basin. In January
2012, TOTAL acquired interests in two exploration licenses (90%,
operator): Block C9 in ultra-deep offshore, and Block Ta29 onshore
in the Taoudenni basin.

Following a 2D seismic survey shot in 2011 on license Ta7,
a well has been prepared and drilling operations started in
February 2013.

On the Ta8 license, drilling of the exploration well ended in 2010.
Results from the well were disappointing.

A 900 km? 2D seismic shot was taken on Block Ta29 in 2012.

On Block C9, a 3D seismic campaign started at the end of
January 2013.

In Morocco, an authorization of recognition was allocated in December
2011 to TOTAL and the ONHYM (National Bureau of Petroleum and
Mines) for an offshore zone of 100,000 km2. In the 2012, the Group
led geological studies and realized a seabed survey. In December 2012,
the authorization of recognition was extended of one year and 3 D
seismic survey shot of 5,000 km? started at the end of 2012.

In Mozambique, TOTAL acquired a 40% stake in the contract

to share the production of the offshore Blocks 3 and 6 in
September 2012. Located in the prolific Rovuma basin, these two
blocks cover a total surface area of 15,250 km? in water depths
ranging from 0 m to 2,500 m. An exploration well was drilled in
2012. The results are currently being analyzed.

In Nigeria, the Group's production was 279 kboe/d in 2012, compared
to 287 kboe/d in 2011 and 301 kboe/d in 2010. This level of production
makes of Nigeria the first contributing country for the productions of
the Group in 2012. TOTAL has been present in Nigeria since 1962.
It operates seven production licenses (OML) out of the thirty-eight in
which it has a stake, and two exploration licenses (OPL) out of the five
in which it has a stake. TOTAL is also the operator of the exploration
Block 1 in the Joint Development Zone (JDZ administered jointly by
Nigeria and Sao Tomé and Principe). The Group is also active in LNG
through Nigeria LNG and the Brass LNG project. Regarding recent
variations in the mining fields:

- In November 2012, TOTAL announced the signing of an agreement
to sell its 20% stake in Block OML 138, which includes the Usan
field. The agreement is subject to approval by the relevant authorities.

In 2011, TOTAL (operator) increased its stake from 45.9% to 48.6%
in Block 1 of the JDZ.

The divestment of the 10% Group's stakes held through the joint

venture operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC)
in Blocks OML 26 and 42 was finalized in 2011, and in Blocks OML
30, 34 and 40 in 2012. Blocks OML 4, 38 and 41 were sold in 2010.

TOTAL owns 15% of the Nigeria LNG gas liquefaction plant,
located on Bonny Island, with an overall LNG capacity of 22Mt/y.

With respect to the Brass LNG gas liquefaction plant project (17%),
preliminary work continued in 2012 prior to launching the construction of
two trains, each with a capacity of 5 Mt/y. Calls for tenders for the
construction of the plant and loading facilities are underway.

TOTAL continues its efforts to strengthen its ability to supply gas to
the LNG projects in which it owns a stake and to meet the growing
domestic demand for gas:

Business overview
Upstream

- As part of its joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Company (NNPC), TOTAL pursued the project to increase the gas
production capacity of the OML 58 license (40%, operator) from
370 Mcf/d to 550 Mcf/d. The second phase of this project will be
the development of additional reserves.

A drilling incident on OML 58 in late March 2012 resulted in the
facilities being stopped. The incident was resolved and production
gradually ramped up as of June 2012. The facilities were stopped
again and secured in October 2012 due to exceptionally high
rainfall. Production resumed in November 2012.

On the OML 112/117 licenses (40%), TOTAL continued
development studies in 2012 for the Ima gas field.

On the OML 99 license (40%, operator), engineering work is
underway to develop the Ikike field, where production is expected
to start in 2016 (estimated capacity: 55 kboe/d).

On the OML 102 license (40%, operator), TOTAL continues to
develop the Ofon phase 2 project, which was launched in 2011,
with an expected capacity of 60 kboe/d and production start-up
scheduled end of 2014. In 2011, the Group also discovered
Etisong North, located 15 km of the currently-producing Ofon
field. The exploration campaign continued in 2012 with the drilling
of the Eben well, which is also south of Ofon. The positive results
produced by this well further enhance the appeal of the future
Etisong-Eben development hub as a satellite of the Ofon field.

On the deep water acreage, TOTAL drilled three exploration wells
in 2012: Obo and Enitimi on JDZ Block 1, and Owowo West on
OPL 223. Results are under study.

On the OML 130 license (24%, operator), the Akpo field reached
plateau production of 225 kboe/d in 2010. The Group is actively
working on the Egina field (capacity of 200 kboe/d), for which a
development plan has been approved by the relevant authorities.
Calls for tender are underway and the contracts should be signed
in the second quarter of 2013.

On the OML 138 license (20%, operator), TOTAL started production
on the Usan offshore field in February 2012 (180 kb/d, capacity
of the FPSO), which reached a level of 120 kboe/d at the end of
2012. As described above, on November 2012, TOTAL signed
an agreement on the sale of its 20% stake in Block OML 138.
This agreement is subject to approval by the relevant authorities,
expected in 2013.

The production that is not operated by the Group in Nigeria comes
mainly from the SPDC association, in which TOTAL holds a 10%
stake. Gas production by the SPDC association in 2011 remained
strong due to the contribution made by the Gbaran-Ubie project,
which started up in 2010. However, the sharp increase of oil
bunkering in 2012 had an impact on onshore production, as well
as on the integrity of the facilities and the environment. TOTAL also
holds a 12.5% interests in Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production
Company (SNEPCO) association, wich operates notably on the
OML 118 license. On this license, the Bonga field contributed
approximately 15 kboe/d to the Group's production in 2012.

On the operated deep water acreage, the Bonga Northwest
development project was progressed in 2012 on the OML
licence (12.5%).

In Uganda, TOTAL finalized in February 2012 its farm-in for an
interest of 33.33% covering the EA-1, EA-1A and EA-2 licenses as
well as the new Kanywataba license and the Kingfisher production
license. All of these licenses are located in the Lake Albert region,
where oil resources have already been discovered.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

TOTAL is the operator of EA-1 and EA-1A and a partner on the other
licenses. TOTAL and its partners are embarking on an exploration
and appraisal program from 2012 onwards.

- The Kanywataba exploration well was drilled in June 2012 and
produced negative results. The license expired in August 2012
and was returned to the authorities.

The EA-1A license expired in February 2013, following a campaign
of several exploration drillings.

On the appraisal license EA-1, a campaign of appraisal

wells, production tests and a 3D seismic survey are planned
for 2012-2014. Five development plans will be submitted to the
authorities before the end of 2013 (Ngiri, Jobi-Rii, Mpyo, Gunya
and Jobi East).

On the appraisal license EA-2, the campaign of appraisal wells
and production tests started in 2012 will continue in 2013.
Several development plans will be submitted to the authorities
before the end of 2013 (Waraga, Kasamene, Wahrindi, Kigogole,
Ngege, Ngara and Nsoga).

The development plan of the EA-3 production license of the Kingfisher
field was finalized by the operator in November 2012 and submitted
to the authorities for approval.

In the Republic of Congo, the Group's production was 113 kboe/d
in 2012, compared to 123 kboe/d in 2011 and 120 kboe/d in 2010.

- The development of the Lianzi field (26.75%) was approved in 2012.
Located in the offshore unitization zone between Angola and
the Republic of Congo, this field will be developed by a tieback
to the existing Benguela-Belize-Lobito-Tomboco platform (Block
14 in Angola). Production start-up is expected in 2015.

— The Moho Bilondo offshore field (53.5%, operator), reached plateau
production of 90 kboe/d in mid-2010. The field has now started
its decline.

The existence of additional resources in the southern portion
of the license was confirmed in 2010, creating the prospects
for additional development of the existing facilities (‘Phase 1b").
The basic engineering studies were finished in 2012.

A series of agreements on the contractual and fiscal conditions
applicable to the Moho Bilondo license were signed with the
authorities in July 2012 and approved by a law passed in October
2012, triggering the development of the northern portion of the
license, the potential of which was bolstered by appraisal and
exploration wells drilled in 2008 and 2009 (Moho North project).
The basic engineering studies were finished in 2012.

The Phase 1b and Moho North projects have been launched

in March 2013, with production start-up planned in 2015 and 2016
respectively. The estimated production capacities are about 140 kboe/d
in 2017 (“Phase 1b" 40 kboe/d, “Moho Nord” 100 kboe/d).

— Production on Libondo (65%, operator), which is part of the Kombi-
Likalala-Libondo operating license, started up in March 2011.
Plateau production reached 12 kboe/d in 2011. A substantial portion
of the equipment was sourced locally in Pointe-Noire through
the redevelopment of a construction site that had been idle for
several years.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, following the Presidential
decree approving TOTAL's entry in 2011 as operator with a 60%
interest in Block III of the Graben Albertine, the exploration permit
was issued in January 2012 by the Minister of Hydrocarbons for

a period of three years and subsequently extended by an additional
year due to the postponement of the works resulting from the general


--- Page 15 ---

security situation in the eastern part of the country. This block is
located in the Lake Albert region. TOTAL acquired an additional
6.66% of this block in March 2012. The prospecting program is limited
to the northern portion of the license, which is outside the Virunga park.
A helicopter acquisition of gravimetric and magnetic data was
completed in August 2012.

In the Republic of South Sudan, TOTAL holds an interest in Block
B and is working with state authorities to resume exploration activities
on this zone. Since the independence of the Republic of South
Sudan on July 9, 2011, TOTAL is no longer present in Sudan.

2.1.7.2. North America

In 2012, TOTAL’s production in North America was 69 kboe/d,
representing 3% of the Group’s overall production, compared
to 67 kboe/d in 2011 and 65 kboe/d in 2010.

In Canada, TOTAL signed in March 2011 a partnership with Suncor
related to the Fort Hills and Joslyn mining projects and the Voyageur
upgrader. This partnership allows TOTAL to reorganize around

two major hubs the different oil sands assets that it has acquired
over the last few years: on the one hand, a Steam Assisted Gravity
Drainage (SAGD) hub focused on Surmont's (50%) ongoing
development and, on the other hand, a mining and upgrading hub,
which includes the TOTAL-operated Joslyn (38.25%) and
Suncor-operated Fort Hills (89.2%) mining projects and the
Suncor-operated Voyageur upgrader (49%) project. The Group also
has a 50% stake in the Northern Lights mining project (operator)
and 100% of a number of oil sands leases acquired through several
auction sales. The Group's production was 12 kboe/d in 2012,
compared to 11 kboe/d in 2011 and 10 kboe/d in 2010.

- On the Surmont lease, gross commercial production in SAGD
mode of the first development phase in 2012 was around
25 kboe/d of bitumen from forty well pairs. The operator plans
to drill additional wells in 2013 and to continue to convert the
activation method on the existing wells from gas lift to electric
submersible pump (ESP) in order to improve production.
In addition, a project to debottleneck the steam has been
initiated which will allow to increase the production of Phase 1.

In early 2010, the partners of the project decided to launch the
construction of the second development phase. The goal of
production start-up from Surmont Phase 2 has been set for

2015 and overall production capacity from the field is expected
to increase to 130 kboe/d. In April 2011, the authorities issued a
license permitting production (phases 1 and 2) of up to 136 kboe/d.

The Joslyn license is expected to be exploited using mining
techniques. After the public hearings in 2010 and the 2011
provincial and federal Canadian authorities approval for a project
of 100 kboe/d, the engineering studies including a review of the
design to optimize the production of the Joslyn North Mine project
are underway. On-site preliminary works were launched (surface
waters drainage and civil engineering).

TOTAL closed in September 2010 the acquisition of UTS and its
main asset: a 20% stake in the Fort Hills lease. In 2011, as part of
their partnership, TOTAL acquired from Suncor an additional 19.2%
stake in the lease, thereby increasing its stake to 39.2%. The
pre-project studies and site preparation work are underway. The
Fort Hills mining project has already been approved by the authorities
for a first development phase with a capacity of 180 kboe/d.
After the completion of the pre-project studies in June 2012,

the basic engineering studies are now in progress, with a final
decision on investment expected for 2013. Some contracts for
detailed engineering works have already been awarded.

Business overview
Upstream

— TOTAL also acquired in December 2010 a 49% interest in the
Voyageur upgrader project, which is operated by Suncor, located
in the Canadian province of Alberta and intended to upgrade
bitumen from the Fort Hills and Joslyn mines. In 2012, the estimate
of this project's cost and the evolution of North American oil markets
modified its strategic and economic perspectives. As a consequence,
the partners, TOTAL and Suncor, launched a joint strategic review
of the development plan for the Voyageur upgrader. This detailed
review included, notably, the optimization of the development
plan, production evacuation logistics studies and implications
of possible evolutions of the project. Pending the finalization of
this review, development spending on the project was minimized
during this period and until a joint decision on the future development
of this project by both partners, TOTAL and Suncor.

On March 27, 2013, TOTAL entered into an agreement for the
sale to Suncor Energy Inc. of its 49% interest in the Voyageur
upgrader project. The mining developments of Fort Hills and
Joslyn are not affected by this transaction and continue
according to the production evacuation logistics studies jointly
conducted with Suncor (see Chapter 7, point 6.).

- The Group also holds a 50% stake in the Northern Lights project,
which is expected to be developed through mining techniques.

In the United States, the Group's production was 57 kboe/d in
2012, compared to 56 kboe/d in 2011 and 55 kboe/d in 2010.

— In the Gulf of Mexico:

- The deep-offshore Tahiti oil field (17%) reached peak production

of 135 kboe/d in 2009. Phase 2, which was launched in

September 2010, comprises drilling four injection wells and two

producing wells. The injection of water, which attempts to limit

the decline of the wells, started in February 2012. The second

producing well is currently being drilled.

The Chinook 4 well in the deep offshore Chinook project (83.33%)

started production in the third quarter of 2012. More drilling

operations are planned, including one well underway (Chinook 5).

The TOTAL (40%) - Cobalt (60%, operator) alliance’s exploratory

drilling campaign was launched in 2009 and the drilling of the

first three wells produced disappointing results. This campaign

was interrupted due to the U.S. government's moratorium

on deep offshore drilling operations in 2010 and resumed

in 2012 with the drilling of the Ligurian 2 and North Platte wells.

Asignificant discovery of oil was made in the latter

in December 2012. Appraisal works are planned.

- In 2010, the Group disposed of its equity stakes in the
Matterhorn and Virgo operated fields.

Following the signature of an agreement in late 2009, a joint
venture was set up with Chesapeake to produce shale gas

in the Barnett Shale Basin in Texas. Under this joint venture,
TOTAL owns 25% of Chesapeake'’s portfolio in the area. In 2011,
approximately 300 additional wells were drilled, enabling gas
production to reach 1.4 Bef/d at the end of 2011. Following the
drop in gas prices in the United States, drilling activity was sharply
reduced in 2012, with around 100 wells being drilled. The hook-up of
certain wells drilled in 2011 helped to maintain production in 2012.

At the end of 2011, TOTAL signed an agreement with Chesapeake
and EnerVest to enter into a joint venture. Pursuant to the agreement,
TOTAL acquired a 25% share in Chesapeake's and EnerVest's
liquid-rich area of the Utica shale play in Ohio. More than

100 wells were drilled in 2012 and forty-seven were connected
and started producing.

Engineers from TOTAL are assigned to the teams led by Chesapeake.

Business overview
Upstream

The Group holds a 50% stake in American Shale Oil LLC (AMSO)
to develop in situ shale oil technology. The pilot to develop this
technology is underway in Colorado.

In March 2012, TOTAL entered a 50/50 joint venture with
Red Leaf Resources for the ex-situ development of oil shale
and agreed to fund a production pilot before any larger-scale
development.

In October 2012, TOTAL finalized an agreement to buy about
30,000 additional acres in Colorado and Utah, with a view

to developing in situ shale oil techniques (AMSO technique)
or ex-situ techniques (Red Leaf technique).

In Mexico, TOTAL is conducting various studies with state-owned
PEMEX under a general technical cooperation agreement renewed
in July 2011 for a period of five years.

2.1.7.3. South America

In 2012, TOTAL’s production in South America was 182 kboe/d,
representing 8% of the Group’s overall production, compared
to 188 kboe/d in 2011 and 179 kboe/d in 2010.

In Argentina, where TOTAL has been present since 1978, the
Group operated 30%!" of the country’s gas production in 2012. The
Group's production was 83 kboe/d in 2012, compared to

86 kboe/d in 2011 and 83 kboe/d in 2010.

- In Tierra del Fuego, the Group notably operates the Carina and
Aries offshore fields (37.5%). Further to the re-appraisal of the
reserves of the Carina field, two additional wells are expected
to be drilled from the existing platform. These wells should allow
production levels from the facilities operated by the Group in
Tierra del Fuego to be maintained at about 615 Mef/d until
the Vega Pleyade field (37.5%, operator) starts up in 2015.

In the Neuquén basin, TOTAL started a drilling campaign in 2011
on its mining licenses in order to assess their shale gas and oil
potential. In 2012, this campaign, which started on the Aguada
Pichana license (27.3%, operator), was extended to all the
blocks operated by the Group: San Roque (24.7%, operator),
Rincon la Ceniza and La Escalonada (85%, operator), Aguada de
Castro (42.5%, operator), and Pampa de las Yeguas I! (42.5%,
operator), as well as to the blocks operated by third parties:
Cerro Las Minas (40%), Cerro Partido (45%), Rincén

de Aranda (45%) and Veta Escondida (45%). The first results

of the production tests on the wells drilled during this campaign
are positive and analyses are underway. The conventional
production continues on the Group's assets in this basin.

In Bolivia, the Group's production, primarily gas, amounted to

27 kboe/d in 2012, compared to 25 kboe/d in 2011 and 20 kboe/d
in 2010. TOTAL has stakes in six licenses: three producing
licenses, San Alberto and San Antonio (15%) and Block XX Tarija
Oeste (41%), and three licenses in the exploration or appraisal
phase, Aquio and Ipati (80%, operator) and Rio Hondo (50%).

- Production started up in February 2011 on the gas and
condensates Itati field located on Block XX Tarija Oeste; it is
routed to the existing facilities of the neighboring San Alberto
field. In early 2011, TOTAL decreased its stake to 41% in Block
XX Tarija Oeste after divesting 34% and is no longer the operator.
The development of phase 2, which was approved by the local
authorities in 2011, continued in 2012 and is expected to

increase the field's production by 1.5 Mmé/d to 4.5 Mmé/d
over the course of 2013.

In 2004, TOTAL discovered the Incahuasi gas field on the Ipati
Block. In 2011, an appraisal well confirmed the extension of

the discovery northwards onto the adjacent Aquio Block. TOTAL
consequently filed a declaration of commerciality for the Aquio
and Ipati Blocks, which was approved by the local authorities

in 2011. Additional appraisal work is underway, notably with

the drilling of a second well on the Ipati Block, which started

in January 2012 with encouraging results. In December 2012,
TOTAL submitted to the Bolivian authorities a Phase 1
development plan, including two wells tied to a central processing
plant of 6.5 Mm&/d for which calls for tenders have been launched.
A third appraisal well should be drilled in 2013 which will be tied
back to the Phase 1 project in case of success.

In Brazil, TOTAL has equity stakes in three exploration blocks:
Blocks BC-2 (41.2%) and BM-C-14 (50%) in the Campos basin,
and Block BM-S-54 (20%) in the Santos basin.

The Xerelete field is mainly located on Block BC-2, with an
extension on Block BM-C-14. In 2012 TOTAL became the
operator of the field. Following seismic reprocessing, a pre-salt
prospect was found under the Xerelete discovery made in 2001
at a water depth of 2,400 m. Further to approval by the
authorities, TOTAL expects to resume drilling activity on

the block at the end of 2013.

On Block BM-S-54, a first well was drilled in the pre-salt at the
end of 2010 on the Gato do Mato structure, and a significant oil
column was found. Between October 2011 and July 2012, an
exploration/delineation campaign was conducted on the block,
enabling a second structure (Epitonium) identified on Block BM-S-54
to be drilled, the productivity of the well drilled in 2010 to be tested
and an appraisal well to be drilled in the northern part of the Gato
do Mato structure. The encouraging results achieved on Gato
do Mato are currently being analyzed in order to define the next
steps in the appraisal of the field.

In Colombia, where TOTAL has had operations since 1973, the
Group's production was 6 kboe/d in 2012, compared to 11 kboe/d
in 2011 and 18 kboe/d in 2010. The drop in production in 2011
was due in particular to TOTAL’s disposal of its interest in CEPSA,
which was finalized in July 2011. The drop in production in 2012
was due to the sale in October 2012 of the Group’s 100% owned
subsidiary, TEPMA BV, which held an interest in the Cusiana field.
This operation also involved the disposal of stakes in the OAM

and ODC pipelines.

In 2011, TOTAL sold 10% of its stake in the Ocensa oil pipeline,
thereby reducing its holding to 5.2%.

Following the discovery of Huron-1 in 2009 on the Niscota (50%)
exploration license and a 3D seismic survey of this discovery in
2010, the first appraisal well, Huron-2, also found hydrocarbons.
and should be tested during the second quarter of 2013.

The drilling of a second appraisal well, Huron-3, is in progress.
The conceptual development studies have started for a declaration
of commerciality in late 2013.

In French Guiana, TOTAL owns a 25% stake in the Guyane
Maritime license. The license, located about 150 km off the coast,
covers an area of approximately 24,100 km? in water depths ranging

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012


--- Page 17 ---

from 200 m to 3,000 m. At the end of 2011, the authorities
extended the research permit until May 31, 2016.

After a 2,500 km? 3D seismic survey of the eastern portion of the
block in 2009 and 2010, drilling started in 2011 of the GM-ES-1
well, about 170 km northeast of Cayenne on the Zaedyus prospect,
at a water depth of more than 2,000 m. This well revealed two
hydrocarbon columns in the gravelly reservoirs.

Two 3D seismic survey campaigns covering a total surface area

of more than 5,000 km? were conducted in the center and extreme
eastern portions of the block in 2012. The results of the GM-ES-2
appraisal well are disappointing, but they do not call the potential
of the license into question. Drilling started on the GM-ES-3
exploration well at the end of 2012, and could be followed

by two more exploration wells in 2013 and 2014.

In Trinidad and Tobago, where TOTAL has had operations since
1996, the Group's production was 16 kboe/d in 2012, compared
to 12 kboe/d in 2011 and 3 kboe/d in 2010. TOTAL holds a 30%
stake in the offshore Angostura field located on Block 2C and

an 8.5% stake in the adjacent exploration Block 3A. Production
started up in May 2011 on Phase 2, which corresponds to the gas
development phase. The process to sell the companies owning
these two assets was engaged in April 2012, with a sale anticipated
in the first half of 2013.

In Uruguay, TOTAL acquired Block 14, located about 250 km
offshore, in an auction sale in March 2012. The license covers
an area of approximately 6,700 km? in water depths ranging from
2,000 m to 3,500 m. Under the terms of the contract to share
production, signed in October 2012, TOTAL agreed to conduct
a 3D seismic survey of the entire block, which started in
November 2012, and to drill one well in the first three-year
exploration phase.

In Venezuela, where TOTAL has had operations since 1980,
the Group's production was 50 kboe/d in 2012, compared to
54 kboe/d in 2011 and 55 kboe/d in 2010. TOTAL has equity
stakes in PetroCedefo (30.3%), which produces and upgrades
extra heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt, in Yucal Placer (69.5%),
which produces gas dedicated to the domestic market,

and in the offshore exploration Block 4, located in Plataforma
Deltana (49%). The development phase of the southern zone of
the PetroCedefo field started in the second half of 2011. Pursuant
to an amendment to the gas sale contract, a new development
phase of the Yucal Placer field, which will boost the production
capacity from 100 Mcf/d to 300 Mef/d, started in June 2012.

2.1.7.4. Asia-Pacific

In 2012, TOTAL’s production in Asia-Pacific was 221 kboe/d,
representing 10% of the Group’s overall production, compared
to 231 kboe/d in 2011 and 248 kboe/d in 2010.

In Australia, where TOTAL has held leasehold rights since 2005,
the Group owns 30% of the Ichthys project, 27.5% of the Gladstone
LNG project and seven offshore exploration licenses, including
three that it operates, off the northwest coast in the Browse and
Bonaparte basins. The Group's production was 5 kboe/d in 2012,
compared to 4 kboe/d in 2011 and 1 kboe/d in 2010.

— At the start of 2013, TOTAL acquired an additional 6% in the
Ichthys project, increasing its stake to 30%. This project,
launched in early 2012, is aimed at the development of the
Ichthys gas and condensates field, located in the Browse basin.
This development includes a floating platform designed for gas
production, treatment and export, an FPSO (with a maximum

Business overview
Upstream

capacity of 100 kb/d of condensates) to stabilize and export
condensates, an 889 km gas pipeline and an onshore
liquefaction plant (capacities of 8.4 Mt/y of LNG and 1.6 Mt/y
of NGL) located in Darwin. The LNG has already been sold
under long-term contracts mainly to Asian buyers. Production
Start-up is expected at year-end 2016.

In late 2010, TOTAL acquired a 20% stake in the GLNG project,
followed by an additional 7.5% stake in March 2011. This
integrated gas production, transport and liquefaction project

is based on the development of coal gas from the Fairview,
Roma, Scotia and Arcadia fields. The final investment decision
was made in early 2011 and start-up is expected in 2015.

LNG production is expected to eventually reach 7.2 Mt/y.

The upstream development of the project and the construction
of the pipeline are underway.

— Two wells were drilled in 2011 on the WA-403 license
(60%, operator). As one well demonstrated the presence
of hydrocarbons, additional appraisal work will take place
on this Block (3D seismic) in the coming years.

- At the end of 2012, TOTAL reduced its exposure on the WA-408
license (60%, operator) by disposing of 50% of its stake to partners.
Three new exploration wells are planned, the first of which started
in December 2012.

In 2012, TOTAL signed an agreement to enter four shale gas
exploration licenses in the South Georgina basin in the center of the
country. Under the terms of the agreement, TOTAL can increase its
stake to 68% and become the operator in the event of development,
which remains subject to approval by the authorities.

In Brunei, where TOTAL has been present since 1986, the Group
operates the offshore Maharaja Lela Jamalulalam gas and condensates
field located on Block B (37.5%). The Group's production was

12 kboe/d in 2012, compared to 13 kboe/d in 2011 and 14 kboe/d
in 2010. The gas is delivered to the Brunei LNG liquefaction plant.

On Block B, the drilling campaign that started in 2009 continued
until 2011. Two of the wells were connected to production facilities
in 2010 and 2011. The other wells, which were exploratory,
revealed new reserves in the southern portion of the field.

A ten-year extension of the mining rights period was granted

in December 2011 by the Brunei government, which has allowed
a project to be launched to develop new reserves which will bring
additional gas production, with deliveries to the Brunei LNG
liquefaction plant starting in 2015.

On deep-offshore exploration Block CA1 (54%, operator), formerly
Block J, exploration operations that were suspended in May 2003
due to a border dispute between Brunei and Malaysia resumed in
September 2010. A new seismic survey started before the summer
of 2011 and an initial campaign of three drilling operations started in
October 2011. This campaign, which continued until October 2012,
was disappointing, despite the identification of some layers containing
hydrocarbons. Surveys to re-appraise the block's potential are
underway and should result in a new exploration strategy.

In China, the Group has had operations since 2006 on the
South Sulige Block, located in the Ordos basin in the Inner
Mongolia province. Following appraisal work by TOTAL, China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and TOTAL agreed

to a development plan pursuant to which CNPC is the operator
and TOTAL has a 49% stake.

The authorities gave the operator permission to undertake
preliminary development work in the spring of 2011.

Business overview
Upstream

The first development wells have been drilled and the facilities
are presently in the test phase.

TOTAL is discussing with Sinopec a joint study agreement on the
potential of the shale gas in a zone of around 4,000 km? near
Nanjing, on which Sinopec plans to conduct seismic and drilling
operations. An agreement could be negotiated with the authorities
to exploit these unconventional resources at a later stage.

In Indonesia, where TOTAL has had operations since 1968,
the Group’s production was 132 kboe/d in 2012, compared
to 158 kboe/d in 2011 and 178 kboe/d in 2010.

TOTAL's operations in Indonesia are primarily concentrated on

the Mahakam permit (60%, operator), which covers in particular the
Peciko and Tunu gas fields. TOTAL also has a stake in the Sisi-Nubi
gas field (47.9%, operator). TOTAL delivers most of its natural gas
production to the Bontang LNG plant operated by the Indonesian
company PT Badak. The overall capacity of the eight liquefaction
trains of the Bontang plant is 22 Mt/y.

In 2012, gas production operated by TOTAL decreased to 1,871 Mcf/d
from 2,227 Mcf/d in 2011 due to the maturity of most of the fields
on the Mahakam field, which is now in decline. The gas operated
and delivered by TOTAL accounted for nearly 79% of Bontang
LNG's supply. Operated condensates and oil production from

the Handil and Bekapai fields are added to this gas production.

— On the Mahakam permit:

- On the Tunu field in 2012, additional wells were drilled in the main
reservoir and development wells targeted shallow gas reservoirs.

- On the Peciko field, Phase 7 drilling, which started in 2009,
is continuing.

- On South Mahakam, which contains the Stupa, West Stupa and
East Mandu condensate gas fields, production started at the
end of October 2012. Other development wells are being drilled.

- On the Sisi-Nubi field, which began production in 2007, drilling
operations continue within the framework of a second phase
of development. The gas from Sisi-Nubi is produced through
Tunu's processing facilities.

— On the Sebuku license (15%), the development of the Ruby gas
field started in February 2011. Production start-up is scheduled
for the end of 2013, with an estimated capacity of 100 Mcf/d.

- On the Sageri exploration Block (50%), the first exploration well
(Lempuk-1X), completed in early 2012, produced negative results.

— In October 2012, TOTAL acquired a 100% stake in the exploration
Block Bengkulu | - Mentawai in the offshore Bengkulu basin,
southwest of Sumatra.

- In October 2012, the Group also acquired a 100% stake in the
exploration Block Telen, in the offshore Kutai basin in the East
Kalimantan province.

— In May 2011, TOTAL acquired a 100% stake in the onshore and
offshore exploration Block South West Bird's Head, located in
the Salawati basin in the province of West Papua. The preparatory
work on the Anggrek Hitam 1 exploration well started at the end
of 2012 and drilling start up is planned for April 2013.

— In December 2011, the Group signed an agreement for a 18.4%
stake in a coal bed methane (CBM) block on Kutai Il in East
Kalimantan province. This supplements the 50% stake acquired
in March 2011 on the similar Kutai Timur Block. The first wells
and core drilling operations are planned for 2013.

Finally, TOTAL conducted surveys of several other exploration
blocks in which it holds an interest: Amborip VI (24.5%), Arafura
Sea (24.5%), Sadang (30%), South East Mahakam (50%,
operator), South Mandar (33%) and South Sageri (45%).

In Malaysia, TOTAL signed a production sharing agreement in
2008 for the offshore exploration Blocks PM303 and PM324.
TOTAL withdrew from the PM303 offshore exploration Block in early
2011 following seismic surveys. Exploration operations continued
on Block PM 324 (50%, operator) and the first high-pressure/high-
temperature drilling started in October 2011. The drilling continued
under difficult technical conditions until September 2012.

In geological terms, the results were disappointing. Surveys are
underway to continue the appraisal of the block’s potential.

TOTAL also signed in November 2010 a new production sharing
agreement for the deep offshore exploration Block SK 317 B
(85%, operator) located off the state of Sarawak. The interpretation
of the 3D seismic data is underway and could result in the drilling
of an exploration well in 2013.

In Myanmar, the Group's production was 16 kboe/d in 2012,
compared to 15 kboe/d in 2011 and 14 kboe/d in 2010. TOTAL

is the operator of the Yadana field (31.2%), which is located on
offshore Blocks M5 and M6. This field produces gas that is delivered
mainly to PTT (the Thai state-owned company) for use in Thai
power plants as well as the domestic market via two pipelines that
were built and are operated by MOGE, a state-owned company.

In September 2012, TOTAL entered into an agreement to take a

40% share of a production sharing agreement on the M-11 offshore
Block in the Martaban basin. The acquisition was approved by

the authorities at the start of 2013. The drilling of an exploration
well is planned for 2013.

In Papua New Guinea, TOTAL acquired in October 2012, subject
to the authorities’ approval, a 40% stake, in the PPL234 and PPL244
offshore permits, 50% in the PRL10 offshore permit and an option
for 35% of the PPL338 and PPL339 onshore permits. The program
includes the drilling of two exploration wells in 2013.

In the Philippines, TOTAL has held a 75% stake in the SC56
license in the southern Sulu Sea since September 2012. The
program of operations includes the refurbishment of the oldest
seismic lines and a new seismic campaign wich was realized
at the beginning of year 2013.

In Thailand, the Group's production, which was 55 kboe/d in 2012,
compared to 41 kboe/d in 2011 and 2010, comes from the Bongkot
(33.33%) offshore gas and condensates field. PTT purchases all

of the natural gas and condensates production from this field.

- In the northern portion of the Bongkot field, new investments
are in progress to allow gas demand to be met and plateau
production to be maintained:

- phase 3J (two well platforms) was launched in late 2010
and started up as scheduled in 2012;

- phase 3K (two well platforms) was approved in September 2011
with start-up scheduled for 2013;

- phase 3L (two well platforms) was approved in
September 2012 with start-up scheduled for 2015; and

- the second low-pressure compressor installation phase to increase
gas production was completed in the first quarter of 2012.

- The southern portion of the field (Greater Bongkot South)
is also being developed in several phases. This development is
designed to include a processing platform, a residential platform

and thirteen production platforms. Production of the first phase
(phase 4A), with a capacity of 350 Mcf/d, started in June 2012.

In Vietnam, TOTAL holds a 35% stake in the production sharing
contract for the offshore 15-1/05 exploration Block following an
agreement signed in 2007 with PetroVietnam. TOTAL has put its
share up for sale.

In 2009, TOTAL and PetroVietnam signed a production sharing

agreement for the onshore Blocks DBSCL-02 and DBSCL-03 (75%,
operator). Based on the seismic information obtained in 2009 and 2010,
the partners have decided not to continue the exploration work and
the license was returned to the authorities when it expired in April 2012.

2.1.7.5. Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)

In 2012, TOTAL’s production in the CIS was 195 kboe/d,
representing 8% of the Group’s overall production,
compared to 119 kboe/d in 2011 and 23 kboe/d in 2010.

In Azerbaijan, where TOTAL has had operations since 1996, on
the field of Shah Deniz (10%), production was 16 kboe/d in 2012
and continues to progress regularly from one year to the next since
2010. TOTAL also holds a 10% stake of the South Caucasus
Pipeline (SCP) gas pipeline that transports the gas produced

in Shah Deniz to the Turkish and Georgian markets. TOTAL also
holds a 5% stake of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline,
which connects Baku and the Mediterranean Sea and evacuates
among others the condensates of Shah Deniz’s gas.

Gas deliveries to Turkey and Georgia continued throughout 2012,
at a lower pace for Turkey due to weaker demand than expected.
Conversely, state-owned SOCAR continued to take greater
quantities of gas than provided for by the agreement.

Development studies and business negotiations for the sale of
additional gas needed to launch a second development phase in
Shah Deniz field continued in 2012. In October 2011, SOCAR and
Botas, a Turkish state-owned company, signed an agreement on the
sale of additional gas volumes and the transfer conditions for volumes
intended for the European market. The front end engineering and
design (FEED) for the second phase were officially launched at the
end of the first quarter of 2012. Negotiations and investigations into
the means of transporting the gas from Shah Deniz to Europe are
continuing at the same time. The goal is to reach a final decision on
the investment in 2013 concerning the second development phase.

In 2009, TOTAL and SOCAR signed an exploration, development
and production sharing agreement for a license located on the
Absheron Block in the Caspian Sea. TOTAL (40%) is the operator
during the exploration phase and a joint operating company will
manage operations during the development and production phase.
In September 2011, the first exploration well revealed a significant
accumulation of gas that was tested in the first quarter of 2012.

A discovery and commerciality declaration was filed in June 2012.
Operations on the well continued with the drilling of a sidetrack to
the north of the structure, which was completed in September 2012
with positive results. The field's development plan is under
preparation and will be submitted to SOCAR for approval in the
coming years, as required by the production sharing contract.

In Kazakhstan, TOTAL has owned since 1992 a 16.81% stake in the
North Caspian license, which covers the Kashagan field in particular.

The Kashagan project is expected to develop the field in several
phases. The development plan for the first phase (300 kb/d) was
approved in February 2004 by the Kazakh authorities, permitting

work to begin on the field. The consortium plans a start-up of
production in 2013.

In May 2012, the members of the North Caspian Sea Production
Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA) consortium and the Kazakh
authorities signed agreements to settle a number of issues
regarding the contractual conditions of the first phase.

In November 2012, TOTAL acquired a 75% share in the North
and South Nurmunai onshore exploration blocks. These two blocks
cover 14,500 km? and are located in the southwest of the country.

In Russia, where TOTAL has had operations through its subsidiary
since 1991, the Group's production, which was 179 kboe/d

in 2012 compared to 105 kboe/d in 2011 and 10 kboe/d in 2010,
comes from the Kharyaga field (40%, operator) and TOTAL’s

stake in Novatek (15.34%).

- In March 2012, the partners in the first development phase
of the Shtokman project through Shtokman Development AG
(TOTAL, 25%) decided to assess the feasibility of a project
focusing exclusively on the production of Liquefied Natural Gas
(LNG). An analysis of the Shtokman project revealed that the
technical solutions initially chosen to produce 23.7 Gm*/y
of gas, half of which to be exported to Europe by pipeline
and the other half to be shipped as LNG, involved capital outlay
and operational costs that were too high to achieve acceptable
profitability. The 2007 agreement between TOTAL and Gazprom
expired on July 1, 2012, but technical discussions are ongoing
between the two companies in order to agree on an economically
viable development.

TOTAL and the Russian company Novatek, listed in Moscow
and London, signed a strategic partnership agreement pursuant
to which TOTAL acquired a 12.09% stake in Novatek in April 2011,
with the intention of both parties for TOTAL to increase its
participation to 19.40% within three years. In December 2011,
TOTAL increased its stake in Novatek by 2% to 14.09%. Since
April 2012, TOTAL has increased its stake in Novatek to reach
15.34% at year-end 2012.

TOTAL and its partner Novatek made the final investment decision
to develop the Termokarstovoye field (capacity 65 kboe/d) at the end
of 2011. This onshore deposit of gas and condensates is located

in the Yamalo-Nenets district. The development and production
license for the Termokarstovoye field is owned by ZAO Terneftegas,
a joint venture between Novatek (51%) and TOTAL (49%).

In October 2011, TOTAL (20%) and Novatek signed the final
agreements for the joint development of the Yamal LNG project.
The Yamal LNG project covers the development of the South
Tambey gas and condensates field, located on the Yamal Peninsula
in the Arctic. The FEED studies were completed at the end of
2012, certain calls for tender have been issued and the final
investment decision could be made in 2013.

On the Kharyaga field, work related to the development plan of
phase 3 is ongoing. This development plan is intended to maintain
plateau production above the 30 kboe/d level reached in late
2009. TOTAL sold 10% of the field to state-owned Zarubezhneft
in January 2010, thereby decreasing its interest to 40%.

In 2009, TOTAL signed an agreement setting forth the principles
of a partnership with KazMunaiGas (KMG) for the development
of the Khvalynskoye gas and condensates field, located offshore
in the Caspian Sea on the border between Kazakhstan and
Russia, under Russian jurisdiction. Pursuant to this agreement,

TOTAL is planning to acquire a 17% share from KMG. This.
transaction will be subject to approval by the authorities.

In Tajikistan, TOTAL signed an agreement in December 2012
with a view to acquiring a 33.3% stake in the Bocktar PSC.
This transaction is subject to approval by the authorities.

2.1.7.6. Europe

In 2012, TOTAL’s production in Europe was 427 kboe/d,
representing 19% of the Group’s overall production, compared
to 512 kboe/d in 2011 and 580 kboe/d in 2010.

In Bulgaria, the Khan Asparuh license (100%, operator), which
covers 14,220 km? in the Black Sea, was awarded to TOTAL in

July 2012 and a concession agreement was signed in August 2012.
TOTAL has agreed to collect the seismic data and to drill two wells
during the five-year term of the contract. An agreement to divest
30% stakes to OMV and Repsol was concluded in November 2012.
Under the terms of this agreement, OMV will be the operator in the
seismic phase and will then hand over the operatorship to TOTAL.

In Cyprus, TOTAL is present on two deep offshore exploration licenses
for Blocks 10 and 11, which were obtained in the second offshore
exploration round launched by the Cypriot government in 2012.

TOTAL signed two production-sharing contracts at the beginning

of 2013 for these blocks which extend over 2,572 km? and 2,958 km?,
respectively, and are located in the southwest of Cyprus, in water
depths ranging from 1,000 m to 2,500 m. The exploration of these
blocks will begin with seismic surveys.

In Denmark, TOTAL has owned since 2010 an 80% stake in and the
operatorship for licenses 1/10 (Nordjylland) and 2/10 (Nordsjaelland,
formerly Frederoskilde). These onshore licenses, the shale gas
potential of which has yet to be assessed, cover areas of 3,000 km?
and 2,300 km2, respectively. Following geoscience surveys on license
1/10 in 2011, the decision was made to drill a well. Initially planned
for 2013, this well is expected to be delayed due to additional
environmental studies requested by the local authorities.
Geoscience surveys are ongoing on license 2/10.

In France, the Group's production was 13 kboe/d in 2012,
compared to 18 kboe/d in 2011 and 21 kboe/d in 2010. TOTAL’s
major assets are the Lacq (100%) and Meillon (100%) gas fields,
located in the southwest part of the country.

On the Lacg field, operated since 1957, a carbon capture and storage
pilot was commissioned in January 2010. In connection with

this project, a boiler has been modified to operate in an oxy-fuel
combustion environment and the carbon dioxide emitted is captured
and re-injected in the depleted Rousse field. As part of TOTAL’s
Sustainable Development policy, this project will allow the Group

to assess one of the technological possibilities for reducing carbon
dioxide emissions. Most of the objectives of the experiment having
been reached, the injection of carbon dioxide, came to an end in
the first quarter 2013. For additional information, see Chapter 12.

Agreements were signed in December 2011 for the sale of the
Itteville, Vert-le-Grand, Vert-le-Petit, La Croix Blanche, Dommartin
Lettrée and Vic-Bilh assets. The operation of these concessions
and the production rights were transferred in January 2012.
Agreements for the sale of the Lacq, Lagrave and Pécorade
assets were also signed in February 2012. These agreements
remain subjet to approval by the authorities, expected in 2013.

The Montélimar exclusive exploration license, awarded to TOTAL
in 2010 to assess, in particular, the shale gas potential of the area,

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

was revoked by the government in October 2011. This revocation
stemmed from the law of July 13, 2011, prohibiting the exploration
and extraction of hydrocarbons by drilling followed by hydraulic
fracturing. The Group had submitted the required report to the
government, in which it undertook not to use hydraulic fracturing

in light of the current prohibition. An appeal has therefore been filed
in December 2011 with the administrative court requesting that
the judge cancel the revocation of the license.

In Italy, the Tempa Rossa field (75%, operator), discovered in 1989
and located on the unitized Gorgoglione concession (Basilicate
region), is one of the Group principal exploration and production
assets in the country. In March 2013, TOTAL has finalized an
agreement to sell a 25% interest in the Tempa Rossa fields.

The transfer of interests will take effect after the Italian authorities
have approved the transactions.

In 2011, Total Italia acquired an additional 25% stake in the Tempa
Rossa field, thereby increasing its share to 75%, as well as an interest
in two exploration licenses. Although preparation work started in
early August 2008, the proceedings initiated by the Prosecutor

of the Potenza Court against Total Italia led to a freeze in the
preparation work (for additional information, see paragraph 5.,
Chapter 7, Legal and arbitration proceedings). New calls for tenders
were launched related to certain contracts that had been cancelled.

Drilling of the Gorgoglione 2 appraisal well that started in June 2010
reached its final depth and was tested in 2012, confirming the results
of the previous wells. The final investment decision was made

in July 2012, following the approval of the state and regional
authorities. The extension plan for the Tarente refinery export system,
needed for the development of the Tempa Rossa field, was approved
at the end of 2011. Start-up of production is expected in 2016 with
a capacity of 55 kboe/d.

In Norway, where the Group has had operations since the mid-
1960s, TOTAL has equity stakes in ninety-one production licenses
on the Norwegian continental shelf, twenty-three of which it
operates. In 2012, the Group's production was 275 kboe/d,
compared to 287 kboe/d in 2011 and 310 kboe/d in 2010.

90 kboe/d is from the Greater Ekofisk Area located in the southern
sector of the North Sea, 106 kboe/d comes from the central and
northern portions of the North Sea and 79 kboe/d comes from
the Haltenbanken region and the Barents Sea.

- In the Norwegian North Sea, where a numerous of development
projects have just been launched, the most substantial
contribution to the Group's production, for the most part
non-operated, comes from the Greater Ekofisk Area
(e.g., Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla).

- Several projects are underway on the Greater Ekofisk Area,
located in the south. The Group owns a 39.9% stake in the
Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields. The Ekofisk South and Eldfisk 2
projects, each with a capacity of 70 kboe/d, were launched
in June 2011 following approval of the development and
operation plans by the authorities. The production is scheduled
to start in 2014 for Ekofisk South and in 2015 for Eldfisk 2.
The project relating to the construction and installation of the
new Ekofisk accommodation and field services center platform
is now in its third year.

- On the Greater Hild Area, located in the north and in which the
Group has a 51% stake (operator), the Martin Linge development
scheme (capacity of 80 kboe/d, formerly known as Hild) was.
selected at the end of 2010 and approved by the authorities in
2012, with production start-up scheduled for 2016.

- The Islay field, operated by the Group and fully owned by

TOTAL, was put into production in April 2012. The Islay field

extends on each side of the Norwegian/Great Britain border

and the Group's interest in the Norwegian part is 5.51%.

Anumber of successful exploration and appraisal activities

were carried out in the North Sea in the 2010-2012 period.

These activities have led to the launch of several development

projects, some of them are already finalized, others are underway

or are expected to be approved soon by the authorities:

. In the central section of the North Sea, on license PL102C
(40%, operator), a fast-track development project had been
launched for the Atla field (formerly known as David), which was
discovered in 2010. Gas production started in October 2012,
less than two years after the discovery of the field.

. Gas production on the Beta West field (10%), a satellite
of Sleipner, located in the central section of the North Sea,
started in April 2011.

. In the Visund area of the Nordic North Sea on license PL120
(7.7%), the Visund South fast-track development project for
the Pan/Pandora discoveries was completed in the fourth
quarter of 2012. Production started up in November 2012.
Visund North, a second fast-track development project, was
launched at the end of 2011 to redevelop the northern portion
of the Visund field and provide development infrastructure for
the nearby exploration prospects and discoveries (Titan) inside
the license. Production is scheduled to start at the end of 2013.
The authorities approved the extension of the PL20 license
(Visund) until the end of 2034.

. The Stjerne project was launched in 2011 to develop the Katla
structure discovered in 2009, located on license PL104 (14.7%)
south of Oseberg in the Nordic North Sea. Start-up of
production is expected in 2013.

. The fast-track development project of the Vigdis North East
structure (PLO89, sold as part of the 2012 transaction with
ExxonMobil described below), which was discovered in 2009
and is located south of Snorre, was launched in 2011.

. Apositive appraisal well was drilled in 2010 on the southern
slope of the Dagny structure (88%) north of Sleipner.

The development project was sanctioned at the end of 2012
and the plan of development and operation (PDO) submitted
to the authorities, with an approval expected for mid-2013.
Production is scheduled to start in 2017.

- In the Norwegian Sea, the Haltenbanken area includes
the Tyrihans (23.2%), Linnorm (20%), Mikkel (7.7%) and Kristin
(6%) fields as well as the Asgard (7.7%) field and its satellites
Yttergryta (24.5%) and Morvin (6%). Morvin started up in
August 2010 as planned, with two producing wells.

The Asgard sub-sea compression project, which will increase
hydrocarbon recovery on the Asgard and Mikkel fields, was
approved by the Norwegian authorities in 2012. All the main
contracts have been awarded.

On the Linnorm gas field, the Onyx South exploration well is
expected to be drilled in 2013. Gas from Linnorm will be exported
from the Nyhamna onshore terminal through a new pipeline
(Polarled project).

The Polarled project (5.11%) was sanctioned in December 2012
and the development plan was submitted to the Norwegian
authorities in January 2013. The project consists in the installation
of a 481 km long pipeline from the Aasta Hansen field to the
Nyhamna terminal and in the expansion of the terminal.

In the Barents Sea, LNG production on Snohvit (18.4%) started
in 2007. This project included the development of the Snahvit,
Albatross and Askeladd natural gas fields, and the construction
of the associated liquefaction facilities (capacity of 4.2 Mt/y).

A project has been launched in 2012 with the objective of
improving the performances of the plant.

Several exploration wells were successfully drilled over
the 2011-2012 period:

- In October 2012, TOTAL drilled a positive exploration well

on the Garantiana structure (40%, operator) on license PL554
in the Nordic North Sea. The drilling of additional exploration
and appraisal wells in the license is currently under study.

In July 2012, TOTAL announced a major gas and condensate
discovery on the King Lear prospect in licenses 146 and 333
in the southern Norwegian North Sea (22.2%). An appraisal
well is planned to be drilled in 2014.

In 2011, TOTAL successfully drilled an exploration well on

the Alve North structure on license PL127 (50%, operator)
near the Norne field. Preliminary studies have been performed.
The data from a new seismic campaign is being interpreted.

In 2011, TOTAL drilled a positive exploration well on the Norvarg
structure in the Barents Sea on license PL535 (40%, operator),
which was awarded during the twentieth licensing round.

The preliminary development studies have been completed
and an appraisal well should be drilled in 2013.

The Group improved its asset portfolio in Norway by obtaining
new licenses and divesting a number of non-strategic assets:

- Inthe beginning of 2013, TOTAL obtained eight new licences
of which four as operator at the occasion of licensing round
APA 2012 (Awards in Predefined Areas). All these licenses are
localized in the Nowergian North sea: PL661 (60%, operator),
PL662 (60%, operator) and PL667 (50%, operator) in the Ekofisk
area, PL675 (40%) and PL676S (20%) in the central part, and
PL190B (10%), PL684 (5%) and PL685 (40%, operator) in the north.

In October 2012, TOTAL and ExxonMobil exchanged interests in
arange of producing and undeveloped assets already in production
or on the verge of being developed. In exchange for its interests
in the PLO89 license (5.6%) and in the Sygna (2.52%), Statfjord
Ost (2.8%) and Snorre (6.18%) fields, TOTAL received the interest
held by ExxonMobil in the Oseberg field (4.7%), the Oseberg
gas transportation system (4.33%) and the PLO29c (100%) and
PLO29b (30%) licenses, which contain part of the Dagny field.
The agreement was finalized and approved by the Norwegian
authorities in the fourth quarter of 2012. TOTAL's share of the
PL104 license is 14.7% and it holds a 38% stake in the Dagny
structure. TOTAL no longer holds a stake in license PLO89.

At the beginning of 2012, during licensing round APA 2011,
TOTAL obtained eight new licenses including five as operator.

In 2011, TOTAL obtained four new exploration licenses during
licensing round APA 2010, including one as operator. The Group
also acquired in 2011 a 40% stake and the role of operator

of license PL554, north of Visund. The exploration well drilled

on this license in 2012 resulted in the discovery of Garantiana.

In June 2011, TOTAL announced that it had signed an agreement
for the planned sale of its entire stake in Gassled (6.4%) and the
associated entities. The sale became effective at the end of 2011.

In 2010, the Group divested its stake in the Valhall and Hod fields.

Business overview
Upstream

In the Netherlands, TOTAL has had natural gas exploration and
production operations since 1964 and currently owns twenty-four
offshore production licenses, including twenty that it operates,
and two offshore exploration licenses, E17c (16.92%) and Kic
(30%). The Group's production was 33 kboe/d in 2012, compared
to 38 kboe/d in 2011 and 42 kboe/d in 2010.

- The L4-D field (55.66%, operator) started production in
November 2012.

- A3D seismic survey of several offshore permits covering an area
of 3,500 km? was conducted between May and
September 2012. The interpretation of the results of this
campaign is expected at the end of 2013.

- The K4-Z development project (50%, operator) began in 2011.
This development is comprised of two sub-sea wells connected
to the existing production and transport facilities. Start-up of
production is expected in 2013.

- The K5-CU development project (49%, operator) was launched
in 2009 and production started up in early 2011. This development
includes four wells supported by a platform that was installed in
2010 and connected to the K5-A platform by a 15 km gas pipeline.

In late 2010, TOTAL disposed of 18.19% of its equity stake in
the NOGAT gas pipeline and decreased its stake to 5%.

In Poland, at the beginning of 2012, TOTAL signed an agreement
to acquire a 49% stake in the Chelm and Werbkowice exploration
concessions in order to assess their shale gas potential. A well was
drilled and tested on the Chelm permit. The results from the well are
being analyzed. TOTAL asked the authorities to relinquish the
Werbkowice permit in September 2012 since it did not meet
expectations.

In the United Kingdom, where TOTAL has had operations since
1962, the Group's production was 106 kboe/d in 2012, compared
to 169 kboe/d in 2011 and 207 kboe/d in 2010. About 90% of
production comes from operated fields located in two major zones:
the Alwyn zone in the northern North Sea, and the Elgin/Franklin
zone in the Central Graben. In 2012, the shutdown of the Elgin,
Franklin and West Franklin fields due to a gas leak from well G4

in Elgin severely impacted production.

- On the Alwyn zone (100%), start-up of satellite fields or new
reservoir compartments allowed production to be maintained.
Wells N54, N53 and N82 started production in May 2012,
September 2011 and February 2010, respectively.

On the Dunbar field (100%), a new drilling survey (Dunbar phase
IV) should begin in the middle of 2013 including three work overs
and six new wells.

The production on the Islay field (94.49%, gas and condensates)
started in April 2012.

In February 2012, TOTAL finalized the divestment of its stake
in the Otter field.

In October 2011, the decision was made to redevelop the
Brent South West formation in Alwyn by drilling two wells:

one production well, which was started in August 2012, and
one water injection well, which is expected to be drilled during
the second semester 2013.

— In Central Graben, at the end of 2011, TOTAL increased its stake
in Elgin Franklin Oil & Gas (EFOG), a company through which it holds
a stake in the Elgin and Franklin fields (46.2%, operator), from 77.5%
to 100%. Following a gas leak on the Elgin field on March 25, 2012,

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

the production on the Elgin, Franklin and West Franklin fields was
stopped and the personnel of the site were evacuated.

In May 2012, TOTAL confirmed that the leak from well G4 had
been successfully stopped and at the end of October 2012,
well G4 was definitively secured by installing five cement plugs.

The enquiry led by TOTAL permitted the clear identification
of the causes of the accident and the definition of new criteria
for well integrity to allow the restart of the production

of Elgin/Franklin in total security.

The production on the Elgin/Franklin area restarted on March 9,
2018, following the approval of the safety case by the UK Health
and Safety Executive (HSE). Production is resuming gradually,
and is expected to soon reach close to 70 kboe/d (approximately
30 kboe/d in TOTAL's share), corresponding to approximately
50% of the production potential from the fields.

In order to recover by 2015 the production level that existed
before the Elgin incident, a redevelopment project envisaging
drilling of new infill wells on Elgin and Franklin is currently under
study.

In addition, the West Franklin Phase II development project
remains ongoing with production start-up scheduled for 2014.

- In addition to Alwyn and the Central Graben, a third area, West of
Shetland, is undergoing development. This area covers the Laggan
and Tormore fields, in which TOTAL acquired an 80% stake in
early 2010.

The decision to develop these two fields was made in March 2010

and production is scheduled to start in 2014 with an expected

capacity of 90 kboe/d. The joint development scheme includes:

- sub-sea production facilities,

- off-gas treatment (gas and condensates) at a plant located near
‘the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands, 150 km away, and

- anew pipeline connected to the Frigg gas pipeline (FUKA) for
the export of gas to the Saint Fergus terminal.

In early 2011, a gas and condensate discovery was made on the
Edradour license (75%, operator), near Laggan and Tormore.
The development of Edradour East by using the infrastructures
in place was decided in the end of December 2012.

In 2010, the Group's stake in the P967 license (operator), which
includes the Tobermory gas discovery, increased to 50% from
43.75%. This license is located north of Laggan/Tormore.

TOTAL also holds a stake in three assets operated by other
parties: the Bruce (43.25%), Keith (25%), and Markham (7.35%)
fields. The Group's stakes in other fields operated by third parties
(Seymour, Alba, Armada, Maria, Moira, Mungo/Monan and
Everest) were sold off in 2012.

Nine new licenses (three in the Northern North Sea, three in Central
Graben and three in West Shetland) were awarded to TOTAL in the
twenty-seventh exploration round, the results of which were
announced on October 25, 2012.

2.1.7.7. Middle-East

TOTAL’s production in the Middle East in 2012 was 493
kboe/d, representing 21% of the Group’s overall production,
compared to 570 kboe/d in 2011 and 527 kboe/d in 2010.

In the United Arab Emirates, where TOTAL has had operations
since 1939, the Group's production was 246 kboe/d in 2012,
compared to 240 kboe/d in 2011 and 222 kboe/d in 2010. In 2012,


--- Page 23 ---

the country maintained a steady rhythm of production, which led
to a slight increase of TOTAL's share of production. The increase
in production in 2011 was mainly due to higher production by
Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) and
Abu Dhabi Marine (ADMA).

TOTAL holds a 75% stake (operator) in the Abu Al Bu Khoosh field,
a 9.5% stake in ADCO, which operates the five major onshore
fields in Abu Dhabi, and a 13.3% stake in ADMA, which operates.
two offshore fields. TOTAL also has a 15% stake in Abu Dhabi Gas
Industries (GASCO), which produces NGL and condensates from
the associated gas produced by ADCO, and a 5% stake in Abu
Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (ADGAS), which produces LNG,
NGL and condensates.

The ADCO license expires in January 2014. In 2012, the Abu Dhabi
authorities started the discussions to define the future of ADCO
beyond that date.

In early 2011, TOTAL and IPIC, a government-owned entity in Abu
Dhabi, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a view
to developing projects of common interest in the Upstream oil and
gas sectors. The analyses continue.

The Group has a 24.5% stake in Dolphin Energy Ltd. alongside
Mubadala, a company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi,
to market gas produced primarily in Qatar to the United Arab Emirates.

The Group also owns 33.33% of Ruwais Fertilizer Industries (FERTIL),
which produces urea. FERTIL 2, a new project, was launched in
2009 to build a new granulated urea unit with a capacity of 3,500 t/d
(1.2 Mt/y). This project is currently being started and is expected to
permit FERTIL to double its production to reach 2 Mt/y by mid-2013.

In Iraq, TOTAL holds an 18.75% stake in the development and
production contract of the Halfaya field in the Missan province.
Production of phase 1 of the project (capacity of 100 kb/d) started
in June 2012 and was 12 kboe/d over the last six months of 2012
(6 kboe/d on overage over the year). The definitive development
plan (estimated capacity of 535 kb/d) was submitted to the
authorities in the beginning of 2013.

In mid-2012, TOTAL finalized the acquisition of a 35% stake in

the Safen (TOTAL will become the operator when a discovery is
declared) and Harir exploration Blocks (respectively covering 424 km?
and 705 km?, northeast of Erbil), and a 20% stake in the Taza Block
(505 km?, southwest of Souleimaniye). The drilling of the Harir 1 well
was completed in the beginning of 2013 and the drilling of the Taza 1
well is in progress. Two new wells are scheduled in 2013.

In Iran, the Group has had no production since 2010. The 2010
production of 2 kb/d came from remaining payments under buyback
contracts. For additional information, see Chapter 4 (Risk Factors).

In Oman, the Group's production in 2012 was 37 kboe/d, stable
compared to 2011 and 2010. The Group produces oil primarily on
Block 6 (4%) as well as on Block 53 (2%)®!, and it produces
Liquefied Natural Gas through its stake in the Oman LNG
(5.54%)/Qalhat LNG (2.04%) liquefaction plant®),which has a
capacity of 10.5 Mt/y.

In Qatar, where TOTAL has had operations since 1936, the Group's
production in 2012 was 139 kboe/d, compared to 155 kboe/d in
2011 and 164 kboe/d in 2010. The Group has equity stakes in the

Business overview
Upstream

Al Khalij field (100%), the NFB Block (20%) in the North field and the
Qatargas 1 liquefaction plant (10%). The Group also holds a 16.7%
in Qatargas 2 train 5.

— In November 2012, TOTAL and Qatar Petroleum signed a new
agreement to continue their partnership on the Al Khalij field for
an additional 25-year period. Under the terms of this protocol,
as from 2014, TOTAL will remain the operator with a 40% stake
and Qatar Petroleum will hold a 60% stake.

- The production contract for the Dolphin gas project, signed in
2001 with state-owned Qatar Petroleum, provides for the sale
of 2 Bef/d of gas from the North Field for a 25-year period. The
gas is processed in the Dolphin plant in Ras Laffan and exported
to the United Arab Emirates through a 360 km gas pipeline.

— Production of Qatargas 2 train 5, which started in 2009, is 8 Mt/year.
TOTAL has been a shareholder in this train since 2006. An agreement
to share the two liquefaction trains of the Qatargas project
(trains 4 and 5) was signed in 2011. The agreement provides
for a 50/50 split of the physical production of the two trains
as well as the associated operating costs and capital outlay.

In addition, TOTAL began to off-take part of the LNG produced
in compliance with the contracts signed in 2006, which provide
for the purchase of 5.2 Mt/y of LNG from Qatargas 2 by the Group.

The Group became a partner in the offshore BC exploration permit
(25%) in May 2011.

In Syria, TOTAL has interests in the Deir Ez Zor permit through its
50% stake in DEZPC (100%, operator) and through the Tabiyeh
contract, which came into effect in October 2009. The Group had no
production in 2012 compared to 53 kboe/d in 2011 and 39 kboe/d
in 2010. TOTAL suspended its activities contributing to the production
of hydrocarbons in Syria in December 2011, in compliance with the
European Union's regulations regarding this country. For additional
information, see Chapter 4 (Risk Factors).

In Yemen, where TOTAL has had operations since 1987,
production was 65 kboe/d in 2012, compared to 86 kboe/d
in 2011 and 66 kboe/d in 2010.

TOTAL has an equity stake in the Yemen LNG project (39.62%).

As part of this project, the Balhaf liquefaction plant on the southern
coast of Yemen is supplied with the gas produced on Block 18,
located near Marib in the center of the country, through a 320 km gas
pipeline. The first LNG train was commissioned in October 2009 and
the second came online in April 2010. The plant's nominal capacity

is 6.7 Mt of LNG per year. 2012 witnessed eight sabotage attacks

‘on the pipeline, which resulted in production losses of nearly 24%.

TOTAL also has stakes in two oil basins, as the operator of Block
10 (Masila Basin, East Shabwa license, 28.57%) and as a partner
on Block 5 (Marib basin, Jannah license, 15%).

TOTAL owns stakes in five onshore exploration licenses: Blocks 69
and 71 (40%), Block 70 (60.1%, operated by TOTAL since July 2010),
and Block 72 (36%, operated by TOTAL since October 2011).

In December 2012, TOTAL's acquisition of a 40% interest in the
Block 3 exploration license, which it will operate, became effective.

(1) TOTAL has a direct interest of 4.00% in Petroleum Development Oman LLC, operator of Block 6, in wich TOTAL has an indirect interest of 4.00% via Pohol (equity affiliate).

(2) TOTAL has indirect interest of 2.00% in Block 53.

2.2. Gas & Power

Gas & Power's primary objective is to contribute to the growth of
the Group by ensuring sales outlets for its current and future natural
gas reserves and production.

In order to optimize these gas resources, particularly liquefied natural
gas (LNG), Gas & Power's activities include trading and marketing

of natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and
electricity, as well as shipping. Gas & Power also has stakes in
infrastructure companies (re-gasification terminals, natural gas transport
and storage, power plants) necessary to implement its strategy.

Gas & Power also manages a coal business line, handling
everything from production to marketing.

2.2.1. Liquefied Natural Gas

A pioneer in the LNG industry, TOTAL today is one of the world’s
leading players" in the sector and has sound and diversified
positions both in the upstream and downstream portions of

the LNG chain. LNG development is key to the Group's strategy,
with TOTAL strengthening its positions in most major production
Zones and markets.

Through its stakes in liquefaction plants® located in Qatar,

the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Nigeria, Norway and Yemen,
and its gas supply agreement with the Bontang LNG plant in
Indonesia, TOTAL markets LNG in all worldwide markets.

In 2012, TOTAL sold 11.4 Mt of LNG, a decrease of 13% compared
to 2011 LNG sales (13.2 Mt) and 7% compared to 2010 sales
(12.3 Mt). This decrease is due in particular to the decline of the
Bontang LNG plant production and to the force majeure events
reported by the Yemen LNG project in 2012. The planned start-up
of the Angola LNG plant in 2013, together with the Group’s
liquefaction projects in Australia, Russia and Nigeria are expected
to allow for growth in the coming years.

Gas & Power is responsible for LNG operations downstream from
liquefaction plants. It is in charge of LNG marketing to third parties
on behalf of Exploration & Production, developing the Group's LNG
portfolio for its trading, marketing and transport operations as well
as re-gasification terminals.

In Nigeria, TOTAL holds a 15% interest in the Nigeria LNG plant.
The Group signed an LNG purchase agreement, initially intended
for deliveries to the United States and Europe, for an initial 0.23 Mt/y
over a 23-year period starting in 2006, to which an additional

0.94 Mt/y was added when the sixth train came on stream in 2007.

TOTAL also holds a 17% stake in the Brass LNG project, which calls
for the construction of two liquefaction trains, each with a capacity
of 5 Mt/y. In conjunction with this acquisition, TOTAL signed a
preliminary agreement with Brass LNG Ltd setting forth the principal
terms of an LNG purchase agreement for approximately one-sixth
of the plant's capacity over a 20-year period. This contract is
subject to the final investment decision for the project.

In Norway, as part of the Snahvit project, in which the Group holds
an 18.4% stake, TOTAL signed in 2004 a purchase agreement for
0.78 Mt/y of LNG over a 15-year period primarily intended for North
America and Europe. LNG deliveries started in 2007.

(1) Company data, based on upstream and downstream LNG portfolios.

Business overview
Upstream

In Qatar, TOTAL signed purchase agreements in 2006 for 5.2 Mt/y
of LNG from train 5 (16.7%) of Qatargas 2 over a 25-year period.
This LNG is marketed mainly in France, the United Kingdom and
North America. LNG deliveries started in 2009.

In Yemen, TOTAL signed an agreement with Yemen LNG Ltd
(39.62%) in 2005 to purchase 2 Mt/y of LNG over a 20-year period,
starting in 2009, which is initially intended for delivery in the United
States and Europe. LNG deliveries started in 2009.

Since 2009, part of the volume purchased by the Group pursuant
to its long-term contracts related to the LNG projects mentioned
above has been diverted to markets in Asia.

In Australia, TOTAL increased its stake in the Ichthys LNG project
from 24% to 30% in early 2013. This project was launched at the
beginning of 2012 and calls for the construction of two LNG trains,
each with a capacity of 4.2 Mt/y. In conjunction with this
acquisition, TOTAL signed an LNG purchase agreement for 0.9 Mt/y
over a 15-year period. Deliveries are expected to start in 2017.

In Angola, TOTAL is involved in the Angola LNG liquefaction project
(13.6%), which includes a 5.2 Mt/y train. The start-up of the project
is planned for mid-2013. A subsidiary of Angola LNG Ltd, Angola
LNG Marketing, in which TOTAL holds an 8.6% stake, was created
in London in July 2012. This subsidiary acts as an intermediary

in charge of marketing LNG volumes from the project.

In the United States, TOTAL entered into an agreement with Kogas
in 2012 for the purchase of 0.7 Mt/y of LNG, over a 20-year period,
from train 3 of the Sabine Pass gas terminal (Louisiana). LNG
deliveries are expected to start in 2017. This contract is conditional
to the final investment decision for the project.

In parallel to this, TOTAL also entered into an agreement with
Sabine Pass Liquefaction LLC for the purchase over a 20-year
period of 2 Mt/y of LNG from train 5 of the Sabine Pass terminal.
LNG deliveries will begin on the date on which train 5 is
commissioned, which is scheduled for 2018. This agreement

is conditional on, among other things, export and construction
permits being obtained by Cheniere for the construction of train
five and the final investment decision for the project.

In addition, TOTAL has signed certain sale agreements for LNG
from the Group's global LNG portfolio:

In China, TOTAL signed an LNG sale agreement with China
National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC). Under this agreement,
which became effective in 2010, TOTAL supplies up to 1 Mt/y
of LNG to CNOOC over a 15-year period.

In South Korea, TOTAL signed an LNG sale agreement in 2011
with Kogas. Under this agreement, TOTAL will deliver up to 2 Mt/y
of LNG to Kogas between 2014 and 2031.

With regard to LNG transport operations, TOTAL has been

the direct long-term charterer since 2004 of the Arctic Lady,

a 145,000 m® LNG tanker that ships TOTAL's share of production
from the Snohvit liquefaction plant in Norway. In November 2011,
TOTAL signed a second long-term contract for the chartering

of a 165,000 m8 LNG tanker, the Meridian Spirit (former Maersk
Meridian), in order to strengthen its transport capacities with
regard to its lifting commitments in Norway.

(2) Exploration & Production is in charge of the Group's natural gas liquefaction and production operations.

Business overview
Upstream

The Group also holds a 30% stake in Gaztransport & Technigaz
(GTT), which focuses mainly on the design and engineering of
membrane cryogenic tanks for LNG tankers. At year-end 2012,
out of a worldwide tonnage estimated at 388 LNG tankers",
260 active LNG tankers were equipped with membrane tanks
built under GTT licenses.

2.2.2. Trading

In 2012, TOTAL continued to pursue its strategy of developing its
operations downstream from natural gas and LNG production. The
aim of this strategy is to optimize access for the Group's current and
future production to traditional markets (with long-term contracts) and
to markets open to international competition (with short-term contracts
and spot sales). In the context of deregulated markets, which allow
customers to more freely access suppliers, in turn leading to marketing
arrangements that are more flexible than traditional long-term contracts,
TOTAL is developing trading, marketing and logistics businesses

to offer its natural gas and LNG production directly to customers.

In parallel, the Group has operations in electricity trading and LPG
as well as coal marketing. Furthermore, TOTAL began to market
in 2011 the petcoke production of the Port Arthur refinery

(United States) on the international market.

Gas & Power's trading teams are located in London, Houston,
Geneva and Singapore and conduct most of their business through
the Group's wholly-owned subsidiaries Total Gas & Power and
Total Gas & Power North America.

2.2.2.1. Gas and electricity

TOTAL has gas and electricity trading operations in Europe and
North America with a view to selling the Group's production and
supplying its marketing subsidiaries.

In Europe, TOTAL marketed 1,488 Bcf (42.1 Bm’) of natural gas
in 2012, including approximately 11% coming from the Group's
production, compared to 1,500 Bef (42.5 Bm’) in 2011 and

1,278 Bef (36.2 Bm*) in 2010. In addition, TOTAL marketed mainly
from external resources 53.3 TWh of electricity in 2012 compared
to 24.2 TWh in 2011 and 27.1 TWh in 2010.

In North America, TOTAL marketed from its own production or
external resources 1,256 Bef (86 Bm‘) of natural gas in 2012, compared
to 1,694 Bef (48 Bm’) in 2011 and 1,798 Bef (61 Bm’) in 2010.

2.2.2.2. LNG

TOTAL has LNG trading operations through spot sales and
fixed-term contracts as described in section 2.2.1. Since 2009,
new purchase agreements from the Qatargas 2 and Yemen LNG
projects and new sale agreements in China, India, Japan, South
Korea and Thailand have substantially developed the Group's LNG
marketing operations, particularly in Asia's most buoyant markets.
This spot and fixed-term LNG portfolio allows TOTAL to supply
gas to its main customers worldwide, while retaining a sufficient
degree of flexibility to react to market opportunities.

In 2012, TOTAL purchased eighty-seven contractual cargoes and
eight spot cargos from Qatar, Yemen, Nigeria, Norway, Russia and
Egypt, compared to ninety-nine and ten, respectively, in 2011 and
ninety-four and twelve, respectively, in 2010. This decrease is due in

(1) Gaztransport & Technigaz data.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

particular to the force majeure events reported by the Yemen LNG
project and the Snahvit project in 2012.

2.2.2.3. LPG

In 2012, TOTAL traded and sold approximately 6.0 Mt of LPG
(butane and propane) worldwide, compared to 5.7 Mt in 2011

and 4.5 Mt in 2010. Approximately 20% of these quantities came
from fields or refineries operated by the Group. LPG trading
involved the use of eleven time-charters, representing 220 voyages
in 2012, and approximately seventy-three spot charters.

2.2.2.4. Coal

In 2012, TOTAL marketed 8.5 Mt of coal in the international market,
compared to 7.5 Mt in 2011 and 7.3 Mt in 2010. More than 80%
of this coal comes from South Africa. Approximately 70% of the
volume was sold in Asia, where coal is used primarily to generate
electricity. The remaining volume was marketed in Europe.

2.2.2.5. Petcoke

In 2011, TOTAL began to market the petcoke produced by the coker
at the Port Arthur refinery. Approximately 1.1 Mt of petcoke was sold
on the international market in 2012, compared to 0.6 Mt in 2011,
to cement plants and electricity producers mainly in Mexico, Brazil,
Turkey, China, Dominican Republic and other Latin Americas.

2.2.3. Marketing

To unlock value from the Group’s production, TOTAL is developing
gas, electricity and coal marketing operations with end users in the
United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. At the end of 2012,
the Group enlarged its European marketing coverage by creating
two marketing affiliates: Total Gas & Power North Europe in Belgium,
and Total Gas & Power Nederland B.V. in the Netherlands.

In the United Kingdom, TOTAL markets gas and electricity

to the industrial and commercial segments through its subsidiary
Total Gas & Power Ltd. In 2012, volumes of gas sold amounted

to 146 Bef (4.2 Bm®), compared to 162 Bef (4.6 Bm*) in 2011 and
173 Bef (4.9 Bm*) in 2010. Sales of electricity totaled approximately
3.9 TWh in 2012, compared to 4.1 Twh in 2011 and in 2010.

In France, TOTAL markets natural gas through its subsidiary Total
Energie Gaz (TEGAZ), the overall sales of which were 176 Bef (5.0 Bm’)
in 2012, compared to 208 Bef (5.9 Bm’) in 2011 and 226 Bef (6.4 Bm®)
in 2010. The Group also markets coal to its French customers.
through its subsidiary CDF Energie, with sales of approximately
0.975 Mt in 2012, compared to 1.2 Mt in 2011 and 1.3 Mt in 2010.

In Spain, TOTAL markets natural gas to the industrial and commercial
segments through Cepsa Gas Comercializadora, in which it holds
a 35% stake. In 2012, volumes of gas sold amounted to 101 Bef
(2.9 Bm), compared to 2.4 Bms in both 2011 and 2010.

In Germany, Total Energie created a marketing subsidiary in 2010,
Total Energy Gas GmbH, which began commercial operations

in 2011. In 2012, this subsidiary marketed 0.15 Bm® of gas

to industrial and commercial customers.

The Group also holds stakes in the marketing companies that
are associated with the Altamira and Hazira LNG re-gasification
terminals located in Mexico and India, respectively.

2.2.4. Gas facil

les

TOTAL develops natural gas transport networks, gas storage
facilities (both liquid and gaseous) and LNG re-gasification terminals
downstream from its natural gas and LNG production.

2.2.4.1. Transport of natural gas

In France, TIGF (Transport Infrastructures Gaz France) comprises
the Group's transport operations located in the southwest. This.
wholly-owned subsidiary operates

a regulated transport network of 5,000 km of gas pipelines. As part
of the development of Franco-Spanish interconnections, TOTAL
decided in 2011 to complete the Euskadour (France-Spain link)
project with commissioning scheduled in 2015. This decision
followed the decisions made in 2010 to invest in the Artére du
Béarn and Girland gas pipeline projects (reinforcement of Artére

de Guyenne), with commissioning scheduled in 2013.

In addition, in 2012 TIGF continued to implement the Third Energy
Package adopted by the European Union in July 2009, which entails
splitting network operations from production and supply operations.

New conditions in the European gas market and, in particular,

the plan for reorganization of gas transmissions launched by Europe
in 2012, have caused TOTAL to seek buyers capable of ensuring
TIGF's long-term development. On February 5, 2013, TOTAL has
entered into exclusive negotiations with a consortium comprising
Snam, EDF and GIC that has submitted a firm offer to acquire all
outstanding shares of TIGF.

In South America, TOTAL owns interests in several natural gas
transport companies in Argentina, Chile and Brazil. These assets
represent a total integrated network of approximately 9,500 km of
pipelines serving the Argentinean, Chilean and Brazilian markets from
gas-producing basins in Bolivia and Argentina, where the Group
has natural gas reserves. These natural gas transport companies
face a difficult operational and financial environment in Argentina
stemming from the absence of an increase in transport tariffs

and restrictions imposed on gas exports. However, GasAndes,

a company in which TOTAL holds a 56.5% stake, successfully
negotiated positive financial arrangements with all its customers.

2.2.4.2. Storage of natural gas and LPG

In France, the Group's storage operations located in the southwest
are grouped under TIGF. This subsidiary operates two storage units
under a negotiated legal regime with a usable capacity of 95 Bcf
(2.7 Bm).

Through its 29.5% stake in Géométhane, TOTAL owns natural
gas storage in a salt cavern in Manosque with a capacity of

10.5 Bef (0.3 Bm®). A 7 Bef (0.2 Bm’) increase in storage capacity
is scheduled to be commissioned in 2017-2018.

In India, TOTAL holds a 50% stake in South Asian LPG Limited
(SALPG), a company that operates an underground import and
storage LPG terminal located on the east coast of the country.
This cavern, the first of its kind in India, has a storage capacity
of 60 kt. In 2012, inbound vessels transported 950 kt of LPG,
compared to 850 kt in 2011 and 779 kt in 2010.

Upstream

2.2.4.3. LNG re-gasification

TOTAL has entered into agreements to obtain long-term access

to LNG re-gasification capacity on the three continents that are the
largest consumers of natural gas: North America (the United States
and Mexico), Europe (France and the United Kingdom), and Asia
(India). This diversified presence allows the Group to access new
liquefaction projects by becoming a long-term buyer of a portion
of the LNG produced at these plants, thereby strengthening its
LNG supply portfolio.

In France, TOTAL holds a 27.54% stake in the Company Fosmax,
formerly called Société du Terminal Méthanier de Fos Cavaou,
and has, through its subsidiary Total Gas & Power Ltd.,

a re-gasification capacity of 2.25 Bm‘/y. The terminal received
fifty-six vessels in 2012, compared to fifty-nine in 2011.

In 2011, TOTAL acquired a 9.99% stake in Dunkerque LNG in order
to develop a methane terminal project with a capacity of 13 Bm*/y.
Trade agreements have also been signed which allow TOTAL to reserve
up to 2 Bm%/y of re-gasification capacity over a 20-year period. The
project is underway and commissioning of the terminal is scheduled
for the end of 2015.

In the United Kingdom, through its equity interest in the

Qatargas 2 project, TOTAL holds an 8.35% stake in the South
Hook LNG re-gasification terminal and an equivalent right of use

to the terminal. Phase 2 of the terminal was commissioned in 2010,
which increased the terminal's total capacity to 742 Bef/y (21 Bm*/y).
In 2012, the terminal re-gasified sixty-eight cargoes from Qatar,
compared to nearly one hundred in 2011.

In Mexico, TOTAL sold in 2011 its entire stake in the Altamira
re-gasification terminal, but it retained a 25% reservation of the
terminal's capacity (.e., 59 Bcf/y, or 1.7 Bm*/y) through its 25%
stake in Gas del Litoral.

In the United States, TOTAL has reserved a re-gasification capacity
of approximately 353 Bef/y (10 Bm*/y) at the Sabine Pass terminal
(Louisiana) for a 20-year period ending in 2029. In April 2012,

the Sabine Pass terminal received the authorization to export LNG
from four trains of liquefaction, which would involve converting

the re-gasification plants into liquefaction plants. As a result, TOTAL
negotiated financial compensation with Cheniere, the terminal's
operator, in the event that the capacity reserved by TOTAL for
re-gasification is restricted before 2029 as a result of the conversion
of the terminal.

In India, TOTAL holds a 26% stake in the Hazira terminal, which

in 2013 is expected to have a natural gas re-gasification capacity
of 244 Bcf/y (6.9 Bm*/y). The terminal, located on the west coast
of India in the Gujarat state, is a merchant terminal with operations
that cover both LNG re-gasification and gas marketing. After a year
of sluggish activity in 2010, the terminal's full capacities are under
contract for 2011 and 2012 as well as 2013. The Indian market's
strong growth prospects have led to plans for an investment
decision in 2013 aimed at increasing the terminal's capacity

to at least 343 Bef/y (9.7 Bm‘/y) by 2017.

2.2.5. Electricity generation
In a context of increasing global demand for electricity, TOTAL has

developed expertise in the power generation sector, especially
through cogeneration and combined-cycle power plant projects.

In Abu Dhabi, the Taweelah A1 plant combines electricity generation
and water desalination. It is owned by Gulf Total Tractebel Power
Cy, in which TOTAL holds a 20% stake. The Taweelah A1 power
plant, in operation since 2003, currently has net power generation
capacity of 1,600 MW and water desalination capacity of 385,000 m°
per day. The plant's production is sold to Abu Dhabi Water and
Electricity Company (ADWEC) as part of a long-term agreement.

In Nigeria, TOTAL and its partner, the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), own interests in two
gas-fired power plant projects that are part of the government's
objectives to develop power generation and increase the share
of natural gas production for domestic use:

- The Afam VI project, part of the Shell Petroleum Development
Company (SPDC) joint venture in which TOTAL holds a 10%
stake, concerns the development of a 630 MW combined-cycle
power plant in production since the end of 2010;

- The development of a new 417 MW combined-cycle power plant
near the city of Obite (Niger Delta) in connection with the OML 58
gas project, part of the joint venture between NNPC and TOTAL.
(40%, operator). A final investment decision is expected in 2014
and commissioning is scheduled in 2015 in open-cycle and 2016
in closed-cycle. The power plant will be connected to the existing
power grid through a new 108 km high-voltage transmission line.

In Thailand, TOTAL owns 28% of Eastern Power and Electric
Company Ltd, which operates the combined-cycle gas power plant
in Bang Bo, with a capacity of 350 MW, in operation since 2003.
The plant's production is sold to the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand under a long-term agreement.

2.2.6. Coal production

For nearly thirty years, TOTAL has produced and exported coal
from South Africa primarily to Europe and Asia. In 2012, TOTAL,
produced 4.4 Mt of coal.

The subsidiary Total Coal South Africa (TCSA) owns and operates
five mines in South Africa. The Group continues to study other
projects aimed at developing its mining resources.

The South African coal produced by TCSA or bought from
third-parties’ mines is either marketed locally or exported through
the port of Richard's Bay, in which TOTAL holds a 5.7% interest.

3. Refining & Chemicals segment

In October 2011, the Group announced a proposed reorganization
of its Downstream and Chemicals segments. The reorganization
became effective on January 1, 2012, with the creation of a
Refining & Chemicals segment, a large industrial group that
encompasses refining, petrochemicals, fertilizers and specialty
chemicals operations. This segment also includes oil trading and
shipping activities. As a result, certain information has been
restated according to the new organization.

{@)_ Including TOTAL's share in CEPSA,
through July 31, 2011, and in TotalErg.

3.1. Refining & Chemicals

Refining & Chemicals includes the Group's refining, petrochemicals,
fertilizers and specialty chemicals businesses. The petrochemicals
business includes base petrochemicals (olefins and aromatics)

and polymer derivatives (polyolefins and polystyrene). The specialty
chemicals business includes elastomer processing, adhesives and
electroplating chemistry. TOTAL is one of the world’s ten largest
integrated producers".

In a context of growing worldwide demand for oil and petrochemicals
driven by non-OECD countries, the strategy of Refining & Chemicals,
in addition to the priority placed on safety and environmental
protection, involves adapting production capacities to changes in
demand in Europe and the United States by focusing on integrated
platforms, and expanding in Asia and the Middle East in order to
access, in particular, dedicated oil and gas resources and to benefit
from market growth. This strategy is underpinned by an effort

(1) Based on publicly available information, 2011 consolidated sales.

In 2012, refinery throughput decreased by 4% compared to 2011,
reflecting essentially the portfolio effect relating to the sale of the
Group's interest in CEPSA at the end of July 2011 and the closure
of the Rome refinery at the end of the third quarter 2012. Excluding
these portfolio effects, throughput increased by 4% due to
increased availability of the Group's refineries. As in 2011, 2012
was marked by higher levels of planned maintenance at European
refineries, in particular the temporary shut-down of the Normandy
refinery during the upgrading project at the end of 2012, as well as
scheduled maintenance at the Provence and Feyzin refineries.

For 2012, the ERMI was 36.0 $/t, more than double the average
during 2011.

Adjusted net operating income from the Refining & Chemicals
segment in 2012 was €1,414 million, an increase of 67%
compared to €848 million in 2011. Expressed in dollars, adjusted
net operating income was $1.8 billion, an increase of 54%
compared to 2011. This increase is mainly due to the positive effect
of improved refining margins in Europe, noting that throughput at
the Group's refineries decreased on a global basis by 4% between
the two periods, and the petrochemical environment weakened,
particularly in Europe and in polymers. The decrease in adjusted net
operating income for the Specialty Chemicals is attributable entirely
to the sale of the resins business in mid-2011.

The ROACE® for the Refining & Chemicals segment was 9% for 2012,
compared to 5% for 2011.

Business overview
Refining & Chemicals

Refining & Chemicals manages the refining operations located
in Europe (excluding the joint venture TotalErg in Italy), the United
States, the Middle East and Asia, for a capacity of 1,953 kb/d
at year-end 2012 (.e., 95% of the Group's total capacity").

The petrochemicals businesses (production and marketing of
base petrochemicals and polymer derivatives) are located mainly
in Europe, the United States, Qatar and in South Korea. Most

of these sites are either adjacent or connected by pipelines to
Group refineries. As a result, TOTAL's petrochemical operations
are integrated within its refining operations.

The goal of the Refining & Petrochemicals business is to improve
the profitability of its operations, including in particular by implementing
synergies related to refining-petrochemicals integration, and to
improve operational efficiency (plant availability, cost control,
energy efficiency) in order to take full advantage of its assets.

In March 2012, TOTAL finalized the acquisition of 35% of Fina
Antwerp Olefins, Europe's second largest base petrochemicals
(monomers) production plant®. The acquisition will open new
opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of the platform
in Antwerp and to pursue its integration, which is one of the
foundations of TOTAL's strategy.

In July 2011, TOTAL closed the sale to IPIC of its 48.83% stake in
CEPSA as part of a public takeover bid on the entire share capital
of CEPSA. With respect to refining operations, this sale concerned
mainly four Spanish refineries (Huelva, Algeciras, Tenerife, Tarragona)
and, with respect to petrochemicals operations, aromatics and
their derivatives.

3.1.1.1. Europe
TOTAL is the largest refiner in Western Europe®.

In Western Europe, TOTAL's refining capacity was 1,742 kb/d

in 2012, compared to 1,787 kb/d in 2011 and 2,135 kb/d in 2010,
accounting for 85% of the Group's overall refining capacity.

The decrease in 2012 was due primarily to the shutdown of the
Rome refinery, while the decrease in 2011 stemmed mainly from
the sale of the Group's stake in CEPSA. The Group operates eight
refineries in Western Europe (one in Antwerp, Belgium, five in France
in Donges, Feyzin, Gonfreville, Grandpuits and La Méde, one in
Immingham in the United Kingdom and one in Leuna, Germany)
and owns stakes in the Schwedt refinery in Germany, the Zeeland
refinery in the Netherlands and the Trecate refinery in Italy through
its interest in TotalErg.

The main petrochemical sites are located in Belgium, in Antwerp
(steam crackers, polyethylene, aromatics) and Feluy (polyolefins,
polystyrene), and in France, in Carling (steam cracker, polyethylene,
polystyrene, aromatics), Feyzin (steam cracker, aromatics),
Gonfreville (steam crackers, styrene, polyolefins, polystyrene,
aromatics) and Lavéra (steam cracker, polypropylene, aromatics).
Europe accounts for 56% of the Group’s petrochemicals capacity,
i.e. 11,803 kt in 2012, compared to 11,013 kt in 2011 and 12,721 kt
in 2010. The increase in 2012 was due mainly to the acquisition of
35% of Fina Antwerp Olefins (discussed above), while the decrease in
2011 was due mainly to the sale of the Group's stake in CEPSA.

- In France, the Group owns five refineries and continues to adapt
its refining capacities and shift the production emphasis to diesel
due to the structural decline in the demand for petroleum
products in Europe and an increase in gasoline surpluses.

Since 2010, TOTAL has been implementing its project to
repurpose the Flanders site. The shutdown of the refining
business results in the gradual dismantling of the units. The
Group has commenced repurposing the site through the creation
of four areas: a technical support center, a refining jobs training
school, an oil depot, and a department whose role is to support
the general revitalization of the site.

In 2010, the Group divested its minority interest (40%) in the
Société de la Raffinerie de Dunkerque (SRD), a company that
specializes in bitumen and base oil production.

In addition, the industrial plan intended to reconfigure the
Normandy refinery is ongoing. The project is intended to upgrade
the refinery and shift the production emphasis to diesel. For this
purpose, the investments resulted in the eventual reduction of
the annual distillation capacity to 12 Mt from 16 Mt, upsizing the
hydrocracker unit for heavy diesel cuts and improving energy
efficiency by lowering carbon dioxide emissions. The new design
should be operational early 2014.

In parallel, the project to modernize the Normandy platform's
petrochemical operations was completed in early 2012. This

project did notably improve the energy efficiency of the steam
cracker and the high-density polyethylene unit.

In Belgium and the Netherlands, the Group is studying a
project intended to increase the conversion capacities of the
Antwerp and Zeeland refineries. This project would make the
refineries more complementary and allow the residual gases
produced by the Antwerp refinery to be used as feedstock
for the petrochemical steam crackers. In addition, in Feluy,
TOTAL is building a new-generation expandable polystyrene
manufacturing plant targeted for the fast-growing insulation
market, with start-up scheduled for first half 2013.

In the United Kingdom, the commissioning in 2011 of the
hydrodesulphurization (HDS) unit at the Lindsey refinery allowed
the refinery to increase its crude processing flexibility (up to 70%
of high-sulphur crudes, compared to 10% previously) and its
low-sulphur diesel production. After announcing in 2010 that it
would put the Lindsey refinery up for sale as part of the sale of
downstream activities in the United Kingdom, the Group, after
receiving no offer meeting its requirements, decided in early 2012
to keep it in its portfolio.

In Italy, TotalErg (49%) holds a 25.9% stake in the Trecate
refinery. The Rome refinery, which was wholly-owned by TotalErg,
was turned into a depot in October 2012.

3.1.1.2. North America

The main sites are located in Texas, in Port Arthur (refinery,
steam cracker), Bayport (polyethylene) and La Porte (polypropylene),
and in Carville, Louisiana (styrene, polystyrene).

In 2008, TOTAL launched a program to upgrade the Port Arthur
refinery that included the construction of a desulphurization unit
commissioned in 2010, a vacuum distillation unit, a deep-conversion
unit (coker) and other associated units, which were successfully
commissioned in 2011. This upgrade enables the refinery to process
more heavy and high-sulphur crudes and to increase production

of lighter products, in particular low-sulphur distillates.

In 2011, TOTAL and BASF purchased Shell's stakes in Sabina,

a butane processing plant, which they transferred to BTP (40%),
their joint subsidiary that owns the Port Arthur steam cracker.

This new structure increases synergies between the refinery and
the steam cracker, which are located on the same site in Port Arthur.
Furthermore, from April 2013, the BTP cracker will be able to produce
up to 35% of its ethylene from ethane and 35% from butane, which will
allow it to benefit from favorable market conditions in the United States.

3.1.1.3. Asia and the Middle East

TOTAL is continuing to expand in growth areas and is developing
sites in countries with favorable access to raw materials.

In Saudi Arabia, TOTAL and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi
Aramco) created a joint venture in 2008, Saudi Aramco Total Refining
and Petrochemical Company (SATORP) held by Saudi Aramco.
(62.5%) and TOTAL (37.5%), to build a 400 kb/d refinery in Jubail.
TOTAL and Saudi Aramco each plan to retain a 37.5% interest,

with the remaining 25% expected to be listed on the Saudi stock
exchange. The main contracts for the construction of the refinery
were signed in mid-2009, concurrent with the start-up of work.
Gradual commissioning of the different units is expected in 2013.

The configuration of this refinery is designed for processing heavy
crudes produced in Arabia and selling fuels and other light products
that meet strict specifications and that are mainly intended for
export. The refinery is also integrated with the petrochemical

units: a 700 kt/y paraxylene unit, a 200 kt/y propylene unit,

and a 140 kt/y benzene unit.

In China, TOTAL holds a 22.4% stake in WEPEC, a company that
operates a refinery located in Dalian and produces also polypropylene.

The Group is also active through its polystyrene plant in Foshan
(Guangzhou region), the capacity of which doubled to 200 kt/y
at the beginning of 2011. TOTAL decided to build a new 200 kt/y
polystyrene plant in Ningbo in the Shanghai region that is
scheduled to start up in 2014.

In South Korea, TOTAL holds a 50% stake in Samsung Total
Petrochemicals Co., Ltd., which operates the petrochemical site
located in Daesan (condensate splitter, steam cracker, styrene,
paraxylene, polyolefins). The joint venture completed in mid-2011
the first debottlenecking phase of the units at the Daesan site,

with the aim of bringing them to full capacity. This first phase
included increasing the capacity of the steam cracker to 1,000 kt/y
and the polyolefin units to 1,150 kt/y. A second phase took place
in September 2012 and involved increasing the capacity of the
paraxylene unit to 700 kt/y.

In addition, to keep up with growth in the Asian markets, two major
investments have been approved for planned start-up in 2014:
anew 240 kt/y EVA") unit and a new aromatic unit with a capacity
of 1.5 Mt/y of paraxylene and benzene, the raw material of which
will be supplied by a new condensate splitter that will also produce
kerosene (1.5 Mt/y) and diesel (1.0 Mt/y). As a result, the site's
paraxylene production capacity will be increased to 1.8 Mt/y.
Overall, these projects should result in the plant doubling its
production capacity between 2011 and 2015.

In Qatar, the Group holds interests” in two steam crackers
(Qapco, Ras Laffan) and four polyethylene lines (Qapco, Qatofin).

A linear low-density polyethylene plant with a capacity of 450 kt/y,
which is operated by Qatofin in Messaied, started up in 2009.

An ethane-based steam cracker in Ras Laffan, designed to produce
1.3 Mt/y of ethylene, started up in 2010. The new 300 kt/y low-density
polyethylene line operated by Qapco was commissioned in the third
quarter 2012.

TOTAL holds a 10% stake in the Ras Laffan condensate refinery,
which has a capacity of 146 kb/d. Plans to double the refinery’s
capacity are being studied.

(2) TOTAL interests: Qapco 20%; Qatofin 49%; Ras Laffan Olefin Cracker 22.5% along with Qatar Petroleum.

3.1.1.8. Development of fuel and polymer
production technologies not based on
hydrocarbons

In addition to optimizing existing processes, TOTAL is exploring
new ways for valorizing carbon resources, conventional or otherwise.
A number of innovative projects are being examined, and entail
defining access to the resource (nature, location, supply method,
transport), the nature of the molecules and targeted markets

(fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals),

and the most appropriate, efficient and environmentally-friendly
conversion processes.

3.1.1.8.1. Coal to polymers

TOTAL has developed know-how in the various processes used

to convert coal into higher value products by gasification.

These efforts allow a better understanding of the technological
issues specific to each process, such as Fischer-Tropsch, methanol,
di-methyl ether (DME) and methane, particularly in terms of energy
optimization, water consumption and carbon capture.

TOTAL has been involved in the feasibility of a coal to olefin (CTO)
conversion project, in partnership with the China Power Investment
utility company. This project includes the innovative methanol-to-olefins
(MTO/OCP) process tested on a demonstration unit basis in Feluy
(Belgium), and would be located in Inner Mongolia (China).

In parallel, TOTAL pursues a program to develop new carbon
capture and storage technologies to reduce the environmental
footprint of the Group's industrial projects based on fossil energy.

In partnership with the French IFP Energies Nouvelles (French
Institute for Oil and Alternative Energies), TOTAL is involved in

an R&D program related to chemical looping combustion, an
innovative process to burn solid and gas feedstock that includes
carbon capture at a very low energy cost. In 2010, this partnership
resulted in the construction of a pilot at the Solaize site in France.

3.1.1.8.2. Biomass to polymers

TOTAL is involved in the development of processes dedicated or
related to the conversion of biomass to polymers. The main area
of focus is the development of a poly (lactic acid) (PLA) production
technology through Futerro, a joint venture with Galactic, a lactic
acid producer as well as developing a technology for dehydration
of bio-alcohols into olefins (monomers for the manufacture of large
conventional polymers), in collaboration with IFPen/Axens.

3.1.1.8.3. Biomass to fuels

TOTAL is a member of the BioTFuel consortium, the objective

of which is to develop a chain for converting lignocellulose into
fungible, sulphur-free liquid products through gasification and
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. To benefit from economies of scale,

it will be possible to convert lignocellulosic feedstock into a blend
with fossil resources. This development involves an initial pilot
demonstration phase.

TOTAL has also been involved in the Swedish BioDME project,
which aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the entire chain,

from DME production through gasification of biomass (black liquor,
residue from the paper industry) to logistics and tests on a fleet of
fourteen dedicated trucks. Although the European program ended
in late 2012, the tests on the fleet of trucks are continuing in 2013.

More generally, TOTAL is paying close attention to the emergence
of the first second-generation biofuel production plants.

In 2012, the Group incorporated:

- in gasoline, 531 kt of ethanol") at its European refineries and
several oil depots”), compared to 494 kt in 2011 and 464 kt in
2010, and

- in diesel, 1,927 kt of VOME® at its European refineries and several
oil depots®, compared to 1,859 kt in 2011 and 1,737 kt in 2010".

(1) Including ethanol from ETBE (Ethy/-tertio-butyl-ether) and biomethanol from bio-MTBE (Methy|-tertio-butyl-ether), expressed in ethanol equivalent. Reference for bio content of ETBE

and bio-MTBE is the RED directive.

3.1.2. Fertilizers

Through its French subsidiary GPN, TOTAL manufactures and
markets mostly nitrogen fertilizers made from natural gas.

In 2012, GPN’s production was limited by the unavailability of
the Rouen ammonia plant during primarily the first half of the year.
This lack of availability had a negative impact on GPN's results.

In recent years, GPN’s manufacturing system was updated through
two investments: the construction of a nitric acid plant in Rouen,
which started up in the second half of 2009, and a urea plant in
Grandpuits, where production is stabilizing. This additional urea
production will enable GPN to position itself in the growing markets
of products that contribute to reducing nitrogen oxide emissions,
including Adblue® for transportation applications.

In January 2012, the Group finalized the divestment of its stake in
Pec-Rhin. GPN's mines and quarries business at the Mazingarbe
site was divested in January 2011.

These actions are intended to improve the competitiveness of GPN
by concentrating its operations on two sites with updated facilities
and a production capacity above the European average.

TOTAL announced in February 2013 that it had received a firm
offer from the Borealis Group for its fertilizing businesses in Europe.
This offer will now be presented to the employees representatives
concerned, as part of the information and consultation procedures.

3.1.3. Specialty chemicals

The specialty chemicals businesses include elastomer processing
(Hutchinson), adhesives (Bostik) and electroplating chemistry
(Atotech). They serve the automotive, construction, electronics,
aerospace and convenience goods markets, for which marketing,
innovation and customer service are key drivers. TOTAL markets
specialty products in more than sixty countries and intends to
develop by combining organic growth and targeted acquisitions.
This development is focused on high-growth markets and the
marketing of innovative products with high added value that meet
the Group’s Sustainable Development approach.

In 2012, the specialty chemicals businesses enjoyed a favorable
business environment due to the resilience of the North American
market and continued growth in emerging countries, despite such
growth slowing down during the year. Although the situation
deteriorated in Europe, it had no notable impact on earnings.

In this context and on a like-for-like basis (excluding Resins), 2012
sales were €5.7 billion, a 7% increase compared to 2011.

The Hutchinson consumer goods business (Mapa® and Spontex®)
was divested in spring 2010.

The Cray Valley coating resins and Sartomer photocure resins
businesses were divested in July 2011. Sales for the divested
lines of business were €860 million in 2010. The hydrocarbon

and structural resins business lines were kept and have been
incorporated into the Petrochemicals division.

(1) Based on publicly available information, 2012 consolidated sales.

3.1.3.1. Elastomer processing

Hutchinson manufactures and markets products derived from
elastomer processing that are principally intended for the automotive,
aerospace and defense industries.

to significantly increased sales on the North American market
and increased sales on the Latin American and Chinese markets.
Sales in Europe fell slightly (-3%) compared to 2011. On the
industrial markets, turnover increased 7% as a result of increased
sales in the civil aviation, railway and offshore oil markets.

To strengthen its position in the aerospace industry, in early 2011
Hutchinson acquired Kaefer, a German company specializing in
aircraft interior equipment (e.g., insulation, ventilation ducts) and,

at the end of 2012, the Canadian company Marquez specializing in
air-conditioning circuits. In the automotive sector, in 2011, Hutchinson
acquired Keum-Ah, a South Korean company specializing in fluid
transfer systems. In 2012, Hutchinson announced the divestment

of 30% of its automobile brake hose business in Palamos (Spain)
through the creation of a joint venture with Japanese company Nichirin,
one of the world leaders in this segment. Additionally, Hutchinson
closed the Oyartzun production plant in Spain at the end of 2012.

Hutchinson continues to develop in strong growth potential
markets and among the most dynamic strongest customers.
Hutchinson continuously strives to innovate, offering its customers
high-performance materials and high-value added solutions
capable of performing the most demanding functions.

3.1.3.2. Adhesives

Bostik is one of the world leaders in the adhesive sector and has
significant positions in the industrial, hygiene and construction markets,
complemented by both consumer and professional distribution channels.

Bostik has fourty-nine production sites worldwide, including twenty
in Europe, nine in North America, eight in Asia, six in Australia-New
Zealand, four in South America and two in Africa.

Bostik continues to strengthen its technological position in the
construction and industrial sectors, accelerate its program for
innovation focused on Sustainable Development, pursue its expansion
in high-growth countries and improve its operational performance.

After the start-up of a new production unit in Vietnam in 2011,

in 2012 Bostik commissioned a new production unit in Egypt and
a third production unit in China, located at Changshu, which is.
expected to be Bostik’s largest plant worldwide, and opened
anew regional technology center for Asia in Shanghai.


--- Page 37 ---

In the United States, Bostik acquired StarQuartz in 2011, increasing
its range of construction adhesives. Bostik is strengthening its
position in growth areas with the acquisition in 2012 of Usina Fortaleza,
a Brazilian company specializing in construction adhesives.

In France, Bostik announced in late 2011 an investment in a new
specialty polyester adhesive production workshop in Ribécourt
and, in October 2012, an investment in a new worldwide and
regional R&D center near Compiégne. In addition, Bostik continued
to rationalize its industrial base with the closure of the Ibos site in
France at year-end 2011 and the announcement in the fourth
quarter of 2012 of the shutdown of production, in mid-2013,

at the sites in Dublin, Ireland, and Barcelona, Spain.

3.1.3.3. Electroplating

Atotech is the second largest company in the electroplating sector

Business overview
Refining & Chemicals

Trading operates extensively on physical and derivatives markets,
both organized and over the counter. In connection with its trading
activities, TOTAL, like most other oil companies, uses derivative
energy instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options)

to adjust its exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil

and refined products. These transactions are entered into with
various counterparties.

For additional information concerning Trading & Shipping’s
derivatives, see Notes 30 (Financial instruments related to

commodity contracts) and 31 (Market risks) to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

All of TOTAL's trading activities are subject to strict internal controls
and trading limits.

In 2012, the oil market remained tight, with a slight increase in oil
prices during the year and crude oil prices firmly in backwardation".
Freight rates improved slightly in 2012, despite the ever growing
availability in charter capacities.

An overview of global oil markets in 2012 is set forth below.

Despite the challenging economic environment, oil demand underwent
sound growth in 2012 (+1.0 Mb/d according to estimations),
especially gasoil (+0.3 Mb/d) and gasoline (+0.5 Mb/d). Growth

was concentrated in Asia (+0.9 Mbd), while demand shrank

in the Atlantic Basin.

The new economic sanctions imposed against Iran in 2012
deprived the market of 0.7 Mb/d of crude supply on average.

In spite of an otherwise abundant crude supply, the loss of Iranian
crude oil sparked tensions during the first half of 2012 with certain
countries restructuring their supplies and stockpiling (especially

in China). The loss of Iran’s crude supply was exacerbated by
production losses in other OPEC and non-OPEC countries.
Despite such production losses, OPEC crude oil production was
estimated to have risen in 2012 by approximately +1.8 Mb/d,
fuelled by the resumption of Libyan production and the production
efforts of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
Non-OPEC production only rose by +0.6 Mb/d in 2012, driven
upward by North America (+1.0 Mb/d), while production was down
in most other regions. In particular, various problems affected
supplies from Yemen (attacks on oil infrastructures), Syria
(embargo), Sudan (disputes on transport tariffs), United Kingdom
(accidents) and Brazil (accidents). NGL production (natural gas
liquids) has increased according to estimations (+0.3 Mb/d), but
biofuel production stagnated due to problems in Brazil.

After a relatively stable January 2012, the dated Brent price
followed the trend spawned in Q4 2011 by quickly climbing from
$110/b on January 31 to culminate in the year's highest price

of $128/b on March 8. The price then fell steadily to $89/b around
June 25, due to abundant supply in the market and a rapid
increase in inventories. Prices took off again during Q3 2012
following a major fall in stock levels, reaching $118/b on August 23

(the year’s second highest price). Prices subsequently eased
off before stabilizing around $110/b at the end of the year.

Global refining capacity rose overall by approximately +1.1 Mb/d,
boosting refinery throughput by +1.0 Mb/d. Refiners faced an
especially high level of unscheduled shutdowns, but that did not
prevent them from increasing their utilization rates, particularly

in Europe and the United States. Product supply remained tight,
and OECD oil industry inventories fell to their lowest level in seven
years by the end of June. Such tensions increased the price
differential between diesel fuel and crude oil.

2012 was once again marked by a widening of the price differential
between WTI crude (West Texas Intermediate, confined to the
central United States) and Brent crude (delivered in the North Sea
and accessible internationally). Brent crude especially came under
tension due to extended maintenance at the Buzzard field in the
North Sea and regular cargo exports to South Korea. In 2012,
WTI continued to experience downward pressure from a rise in
local production and exports from Canada, the combination of
which exceeded local refining capacity requirements and pipeline
capacities to American refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. WTI prices
fell during 2012, while Brent prices continued to rise, thereby
widening their price differential.

3.2.2. Shipping

The transportation of crude oil and refined products necessary

to develop the Group's activities is arranged by Shipping. These
needs are met through transactions on the spot market and the
development of a balanced time charter policy. Shipping’s rigorous
safety policy is due mainly to the strict selection of the vessels
that it charters. Like a certain number of other oil companies

and shipowners, the Group uses freight rate derivative contracts
to adjust its exposure to freight rate fluctuations.

(1) “Backwardation” is a term used to describe an energy market in which the anticipated value of the spot price in the future is lower than the current spot price.

The reverse situation is described as “contango”,

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

In 2012, Shipping chartered more than 3,000 voyages to transport
approximately 115 Mt of crude oil and refined products. As of
December 31, 2012, it employed a fleet of fifty-one vessels, none

of which were single-hulled, that were chartered under long-term
or medium-term agreements (including ten LPG carriers). The fleet
has an average age of approximately five years.

The year 2012 was difficult for the oil shipping business with
heightened activity levels during the first half of the year in strong
contrast to those of the second half of the year. At the same time,
marine fuel attained record-breaking levels with a strong knock-on
effect on transport costs.

In the first half of 2012, VLCC crude transportation increased by
nearly 10% compared to the first half of 2011 due to high exports
from the Persian Gulf to the United States and stockpiling in China.
At the same time, growth of the fleet was offset by the large number
of delayed deliveries and the high demolition rate. The balance
between supply and demand improved, allowing rates

to rise substantially.

The situation worsened considerably during the second half of

the year, mirroring the same situation witnessed in 2011. Following
the loss of the economic effects felt during the first half of the year,
charter rates plummeted at the beginning of the summer, leaving
the crude transportation market at a historic low.

With regard to the product tanker market, the situation has generally
improved compared to 2011. Arbitrage in favor of longer routes,
especially to Asia, has been beneficial for larger-sized vessels.

In October 2011, the Group announced a proposed reorganization
of its Downstream and Chemicals segments. The reorganization
became effective on January 1, 2012, with the creation of a
Marketing & Services segment which is dedicated to worldwide
supply and marketing activities in the oil products field. Since

July 1, 2012, it includes the activities of New Energies. As a result,
certain information has been restated according to the new
organization.

The number of prototype electric vehicle fueling stations (fast
charge) is also increasing. Today, TOTAL has around twenty
charging stations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany
and France.

4.2. New Energies

New Energies is developing renewables that will complement
hydrocarbons so as to meet the increasing global demand for
energy. In meeting this objective, the Group has two main focuses:
solar energy, which benefits from unlimited energetic resources
and is expected to play a key role by 2030, in particular in certain
geographical zones where the Group has a significant presence,
and the transformation of biomass, which aims to develop new
bio-sourced product solutions for the Group's downstream markets,
Marketing & Services and Refining & Chemicals. An active watch

is kept on other technologies, such as marine energy.

4.2.1. Solar energy

TOTAL is developing upstream operations through industrial
production and downstream marketing activities in the photovoltaic
sector based on crystalline silicon technology. The Group is also
pursuing R&D in this field through several partnerships, as well

as in the concentrated solar power field.

4.2.1.1. Solar photovoltaic

The photovoltaic industry has undergone significant changes since
2011, with the disappearance of numerous players and cuts in
subsidy programs prompted by the collapse of prices and excess
production capacity. The competitiveness of photovoltaic solar
energy has been strengthened by the significant drop in the cost
of modules over the past eighteen months, which should cause

its share of the energy mix rise while helping to cut greenhouse
gas emissions at the same time.

4.2.1.1.1. SunPower

TOTAL now holds 66% of SunPower, a U.S. company based

in San Jose, California, and listed on NASDAQ (NASDAQ: SPWR),
following a friendly takeover bid in June 2011 and a capital increase
in January 2012 in conjunction with SunPower's integration of
Tenesol, TOTAL's long-established solar subsidiary present mainly
in Europe and Africa.

SunPower is an integrated player that designs, manufactures
and supplies the highest-efficiency solar panels in the market. It is
active throughout the solar chain, from cell production based on
crystalline silicon to the design and construction of turnkey large
power plants, passing by the commercialization of solar solutions
for residential and commercial markets.

Upstream, SunPower manufactures all of its cells in Asia (Philippines,
Malaysia) and has a total production capacity of 1,200 MW/y.

The company is continuing to adjust its production capacity while
maintaining its technological leadership. The cells are assembled
into modules, or solar panels, in plants located in Asia, North America,
Europe and South Africa.

Downstream, SunPower is present in most major geographic markets
(United States, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa), with operations.
ranging from residential roof tiles to large solar power plants.

Business overview
Marketing & Services

In 2012, TOTAL launched a program of six experimental pilot
schemes of multi-energy and energy services offers designed
to encourage reductions in consumption, to develop hybrid
fuel/photovoltaic technical solutions and to facilitate access
to energy in rural Africa.

4.2.1.1.2. Photovoltech

TOTAL holds a 50% interest in Photovoltech, a Belgian company
specialized in manufacturing multicrystalline photovoltaic cells.
Against the crisis context, the company, which suffered structural
losses, is in the process of closing down.

4.2.1.1.3. Other assets

The overseas activities previously operated by Tenesol are now
managed by Sunzil, in which TOTAL holds a 50% stake.

Elsewhere, the Group is continuing its projects to display solar
application solutions as part of decentralized rural electrification projects
in a number of countries, including in South Africa via Kwazulu
Energy Services Company (KES), in which TOTAL holds a 35% stake.

4.2.1.2. Concentrated solar power

TOTAL won in 2010 the call for tenders for the construction and
25-year operation of a 109 MW concentrated solar power plant in
Abu Dhabi. The Shams project (20%) is being carried out

in partnership with Masdar through the Abu Dhabi Future Energy
Company (ADFEC). Construction work started in July 2010 and
the plant started up in early 2013. The production will be sold

to Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Company (ADWEC).

4.2.1.3. New solar technologies

In order to strengthen its technological leadership in the crystalline
silicon field, TOTAL invests considerable efforts in R&D programs
through a partnership network with major laboratories and
international research institutes in France and abroad operated

by mixed research teams.

They are tasked with optimizing the photovoltaic solar chain (silicon,
wafers, cells, modules and systems) by cutting production costs
and multiplying its applications, while increasing the efficiency

of the components in terms of electric conversion.

The IMEC (Interuniversity MicroElectronics Center — Belgium)
research center hosts an R&D team from TOTAL and is involved
in research programs looking into the reduction of quantities

of silicon required by cells and the improvement of their efficiency.

TOTAL is also conducting researches into next-generation
photovoltaic cells and modules through a partnership with the
Ecole Polytechnique’s Laboratory of physics of interfaces and thin
layers which is specialized in plasma-deposition processes at low
temperatures. Following on from this partnership, in March 2012,
TOTAL and EDF, the CNRS and the Ecole Polytechnique announced
the creation of the IPVF (Institut photovoltaique d’lle-de-France),
created to become one of the top five worldwide centers conducting
research into latest-generation photovoltaic devices.

Another team from TOTAL is collaborating with scientists from
the LAAS-CNRS (Laboratoire d’Analyse et d’Architecture des
Systémes) in Toulouse, France, on improving module energy
performance through a system-based approach.

Business overview
Marketing & Services

With respect to electricity storage, TOTAL continues its research
program started in 2009 with a laboratory from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States to develop a new
battery technology. TOTAL also invested in 2011 in the Ambri
start-up which comes from the same laboratory.

The difficulties experienced in improving the technology developed
by AEP Polysilicon Corporation (AEP) (30%) to produce solar-quality
silicon resulted in the project being abandoned and the industrial
pilot being shut down. The Konarka Technologies Inc. start-up
(25%) did not succeed in raising the capital needed to the
continuation of its activities is being wound up.

4.2.2. Biotechnologies and the conversion
of biomass

TOTAL is exploring a number of avenues for developing biomass
transformation, which vary depending on the resource used,
markets targeted (fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, specialty
chemicals, etc.) and the nature of the conversion processes.
New Energies has chosen to target one out of the two primary
conversion processes: biochemicals.

Since 2010, TOTAL has been pursuing its strategic biotechnologies
partnership with Amyris Inc., an American company (NASDAQ:
AMRS) specializing in this domain. The Group holds an 18.5%
stake in the company as of December 31, 2012, and entered into
a collaboration agreement regarding research, development,
production and commercialization of new bio-based molecules
that will be used in the upstream markets of oil and green

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

chemicals. A common R&D team will be implemented. Amyris
owns a cutting-edge industrial synthetic biological platform
designed to create and optimize micro-organisms that can convert
sugars into molecules of interest through fermentation. Amyris also
owns a research laboratory and pilot units in California as well as
in Brazil. Amyris started its industrial production facility in Paraiso,
Brazil, at the beginning of 2013.

In addition, the Group continues to develop a network of R&D
partnerships in technology segments that are complementary
with Amyris’ platform (deconstruction of lignocelluloses,

new biosynthesis processes, tools for metabolism engineering
and processes linked to biochemicals routes), including with
the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBE!) (United States), Novogy
(United States), the University of Wageningen (Holland) and
the Toulouse White Biotechnology consortium (TWB) (France).

The Group is also assessing the potential of phototrophic processes
and bio-engineering of microalgae. It entered into a partnership
with Cellectis S.A. to conduct exploratory research on this field.
The Group also takes part in the AlgaePark consortium (Netherland).

4.2.3. Other renewable energies

In wind power, TOTAL owns a 12 MW wind farm in Mardyck
(near Dunkirk, France), which was commissioned in 2003.

In marine energy, TOTAL holds a 26.6% share in Scotrenewables
Tidal Power, located in the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Tests are
being conducted on a 250 kW prototype. A 2 MW commercial
model is being developed.

Refining & Chemicals 1,944 1,910 2,124
Marketing & Services 1,301 1,834 1,019
Corporate 80 135 81
Total 22,943 24,541 16,273

Organic capital expenditure, including net investment in equity
affiliates and non-consolidated subsidiaries, amounted to

$23.8 billion in 2012 (€18.5 billion), compared with $20.6 billion
in 2011 (€14.8 billion). In addition to this, $4 billion (€3.1 billion)
was invested in acquisitions.

TOTAL investment (including acquisitions) therefore decreased
from $34.2 billion (€24.5 billion) in 2011 to $29.5 billion (€22.9
billion) in 2012. The decrease in capital expenditure comes mainly
from the Upstream and Marketing & Services segments. While
continuing to develop its major Exploration & Production projects
in 2012, the Group significantly reduced the amount spent on
acquisitions, which came to $4 billion in 2012 compared with
more than $12 billion in 2011. These acquisitions were primarily

in the Upstream Segment, and included in particular the acquisition
of interests in exploration and production licenses in Uganda,

an additional 1.3% stake in Novatek, various exploration licenses
and the carry agreement in the Utica shale gas and condensates
field in the United States. In the Refining & Chemicals segment,
the Group also acquired a minority interest in Fina Antwerp Olefins.

5.2. Major investments anticipated

For the year 2013, TOTAL announced an organic capital
expenditure budget® of $28 billion, over 80% of which is dedicated
to the Upstream segment. A $23 billion capital expenditure in the
Upstream segment is expected to be mainly dedicated to major
development projects, including GLNG in Australia, Surmont

in Canada, the Ekofisk and Eldkisk areas in Norway, Kashagan in
Kazakhstan, the Laggan Tormore projects in the United Kingdom,
CLOV in Angola, Ofon II in Nigeria and Moho North in Congo.
Approximately 30% of the Upstream segments overall capital
expenditure budget is expected to be dedicated to maintenance
and integrity work on assets already in production and 70% is
intended for future projects and exploration.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, the nearly $3 billion capital
expenditure budget is expected to be dedicated to the refining,
petrochemicals and specialty chemicals businesses. In particular,
2013 is expected to be marked by the ongoing construction and
start-up of the Jubail refinery in Saudi Arabia. A significant portion
of the segment's budget will also be allocated to maintenance
and safety, which are vital to this type of industrial activity.

In addition to these acquisitions, capital expenditure in the Upstream
segment was mainly intended to develop new hydrocarbon production
facilities, exploration operations and acquisition of new licenses.

In 2012, development expenditure was devoted primarily to the
following projects: GLNG and Ichthys in Australia, Surmont in
Canada, the Ekofisk and Eldfisk areas in Norway and the Mahakam
area in Indonesia, Kashagan in Kazakhstan; the Laggan Tormore
projects in the United Kingdom, CLOV in Angola; Anguille and
Mandji in Gabon and Ofon II in Nigeria.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, capital expenditure was
devoted to the maintenance of facilities and safety and to projects
to increase the production of lighter products, add desulphurization
capacities, adapt the refining base to new specifications and improve
energy efficiency. 2012 was marked by the upgrading project

at the Normandy refinery in France and ongoing construction

of the Jubail refinery in Saudi Arabia.

In the Marketing & Services segment, capital expenditure in 2012
was mainly dedicated to the network, logistics and specialty
production and storage facilities.

In 2012, asset sales totaled $5.9 billion compared with nearly

$11 billion in 2011, comprised essentially of sales of the remainder
of the Group's shares of Sanofi, a stake in the Gassled pipeline

in Norway, Upstream assets in Nigeria, the United Kingdom,
Colombia and France, as well as interests in Pec-Rhin

and Geostock in France and in Composites One in the US.

The Marketing & Services segment has a nearly $2 billion capital
expenditure budget for 2013 to finance, in particular, the service
station network, logistics, specialty production and storage facilities
(lubricants, LPG, etc.) and the development of its activities in New
Energies. Most of the Marketing & Services budget will be allocated
to growth areas (Africa, Middle East, Asia and Latin America).

Beyond 2013, TOTAL plans to make sustained investments to support
the growth of its activities, prioritizing the Upstream segment.

TOTAL self-finances most of its capital expenditure from cash
flow from operations (see the consolidated statement of cash flow,
Chapter 9, point 5.), which is essentially increased by accessing
the bond market on a regular basis, when conditions on the
financial markets are favorable (see Note 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Chapter 9, point 7.). However, capital
expenditure for joint ventures between TOTAL and external
partners are generally funded through project financing.

For 2013, the Group has also announced that it wishes to divest
certain assets from its portfolio, and its budget provides for asset
disposals worth over $6 billion more than planned acquisitions.

(1) Major acquisitions and disposals for fiscal years 2010-2012 are detailed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Registration Document.

(2) Based on average exchange rates for 2012 of $1.2848/€.

Summary of results and financial position

1. Summary of results and financial position

1.1. Overview of the 2012 fiscal year for TOTAL

The year 2012 was marked by an economic slowdown that damped
the oil demand from OECD countries. The dynamism of emerging
countries and the needs brought about by the Fukushima accident
in Japan however sustained the overall growth of the demand

for oil products, particularly in Asia at the year end. Market supplies
remained adequate mainly due to the increase in non-conventional
il production in North America, whereas the persistence of geopolitical
factors put a strain on the supply. The average price of Brent
therefore remained stable, standing at $111.7/b in 2012 against
$111.3/b in 2011.

Gas spot prices remained stable in Europe and Asia in 2012,
sustained by the demand on Asian markets. However, spot prices
for gas in the United States dropped to very low levels due to the
abundant supply of natural gas following the development of shale
gas, further strengthened by associated gas production from the
production of unconventional liquids.

The further progressive decline in European refining capacity
combined with very high level of maintenance downtime in the global
refining industry limited the overcapacity observed since 2009,
thereby causing refining margins to rebound from $17/t in 2011 to $36/t
in 20120. Margins in petrochemicals in Europe declined on average
over the year due to the drop in demand caused by the economic
slowdown. On the other hand, in the United States, the petrochemicals
segment benefited from the decrease in the prices of ethane

and liquefied petroleum gases, driving a rebound in margins.

In this environment, TOTAL's adjusted net income amounted

to €12.4 billion, up from the year 2011. This result essentially
reflects the good performance of the segments, in an environment
conducive to the Upstream segment and marked by a temporary
but significant rebound in refining margins in the downstream
segment. The Upstream segment’s adjusted net operating income
reached €11.2 billion in 2012, a 6% increase from the previous
year, supported mainly by the change in the €-$ exchange rate.
The Refining & Chemicals segment reported a 67% increase

in its adjusted net operating income. This increase is primarily due
to the increase in refining margins. Lastly, the Marketing & Services
segment recorded a 3% increase in income compared with 2011.

The year 2012 was marked by a significant decline in acquisitions
compared with 2011, and asset sales of $6 billion reflecting

the Group's intention to optimize and simplify its portfolio,

by developing its Upstream assets with high growth potential.

TOTAL benefited from the rise in its operating cash flow and

the drop in acquisitions to fund its investments while increasing

its dividend by nearly 3% to €2.34 per share, which will be submitted
for approval to the Shareholders’ Meeting on May 17, 2013. The balance
sheet was further strengthened with a ratio of net debt to equity

of 21% at the end of 2012 compared with 23% at the end of 2011.

In terms of operations, the Group had to deal with accidents
in the North Sea and Nigeria in 2012, as well as safety issues in its
facilities in Yemen which affected its productions. With responsibility

(1) Based on TOTAL's “European Refining Margin Indicator’
(2) Total Recordable Injury Rate.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

and transparency, TOTAL reasserted the utmost priority it gives

to the safety of operations and its commitment to environmental
protection. It improved its safety performance further, with an 18%
drop in the Group-wide TRIR® compared with 2011.

In the Upstream segment, four major discoveries in Argentina,

the United States in the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria and Norway were
made as a result of the Group's bolder exploration strategy.

The year 2012 also witnessed successful production start-ups
especially in the fields of Usan, Islay, Bongkot South, Halfaya and
South Mahakam. New major projects, such as Ofon Il, Hild and
Tempa Rossa, were launched in order to secure growth in the years
to come. In 2012, the Group also extended its oil and gas acreage
by obtaining licenses in promising exploration areas, particularly

in Iraq, Bulgaria, Uruguay, Kenya and Kazakhstan.

At the same time, TOTAL disposed of certain mature or non-strategic
Upstream assets, such as stakes in pipelines in Norway, its production
subsidiary in Columbia or minority stakes in assets in Nigeria and
the North Sea. It also announced the sale of its stakes in the OML
138 offshore Block in Nigeria including the Usan field.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, TOTAL set out its strategy

of increasing the competitive performance of its activities to boost
the segments profitability from 6% in 2010 to 13% in 2015 in the
market environment of 2010, scaling down its exposure to mature
zones, mainly Europe, and bolstering its presence in high-growth
areas. Thus, the year 2012 witnessed advances in the modernization
of the refinery in Normandy, France, and the construction of the Jubail
refinery in Saudi Arabia slated to start production in 2013.

In the Marketing & Services segment, the Group restructured

its organization in 2012 in order to achieve its ambitions for growth.
It consolidated its leading position in the African continent and

in the Middle-East notably with the development of its activities

in Jordan and its sale of specialty products. In Europe, it continued
to optimize its activities by deploying its new concept of Total Access
in 300 service stations by the end of 2012. In the New Energies
segment, TOTAL stepped up its efforts to enhance its competitiveness
in the field of photovoltaic solar energy against a backdrop of profound
changes in the industry, and at the end of 2012, it announced the
commercial success of its subsidiary SunPower with the sale of the
Antelope Valley project in the United States.

The process initiated in 2004 to increase R&D budgets continued

with expenditures of €805 million in 2012, up 4% compared with 2011,
with the aim, in particular, of the continued improvement of the Group's
technological expertise in the development of oil and gas resources
and the development of solar, biomass, carbon capture and storage
technologies in order to contribute to changes in the global energy mix.

Finally, in 2012, TOTAL reasserted the priority on safety and

the environment as part of its operations throughout its business.
For all of its projects conducted in a large number of countries,
the Group puts an emphasis on Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) challenges and the development of the local economies.

1.2.1. Sales

Consolidated sales increased by 8% to € 200,061 million in 2012
from €184,693 million in 2011.

1.2.2. Operating income

On average, the oil market environment was stable compared

to the previous year. For 2012, the average Brent price remained
around 111.7 $/b and the average realized price of gas for the
Group increased by 3% to 6.74 $/Mbtu, compared to 6.53 $/Mbtu
in 2011. In the downstream, the ERMI increased to 36.0 $/t

on average for 2012, compared to 17.4 $/t in 2011.

The euro-dollar exchange rate averaged 1.28 $/€ in 2012
compared to 1.39 $/€ in 2011.

In this environment, the adjusted operating income from the business
segments was €24,986 million, an increase of 2% compared

to 2011". Expressed in dollars”), the adjusted operating income

for the business segments was $32.1 billion, a decrease of 6%
compared to 2011, essentially due to lower Upstream results which
were partially offset by improved results from Refining & Chemicals
and Marketing & Services.

The effective tax rate®, for the business segments was 55.2%

in 2012 compared to 57.9% in 2011, essentially due to a decrease
in the effective tax rate for Upstream and the increased contribution
of downstream activities to the Group results.

Adjusted net operating income from the business segments was
€13,437 million compared to €12,263 million in 2011, an increase
of 10%.

Expressed in dollars, adjusted net operating income from the business
segments increased by 1%. The fact that adjusted net operating
income from the business segments increased in 2012 while the
adjusted operating income from the business segments decreased
compared to 2011 is explained mainly by the decrease in the effective
tax rates in the two periods and an increase in the contribution

of equity affiliates to adjusted results.

1.2.3. Net income (Group share)

Adjusted net income was €12,361 million in 2012, an increase
of 8% compared to €11,424 million in 2011. Expressed in dollars,
adjusted net income of $15.9 billion was stable compared to 2011.

Adjusted net income excludes the after-tax inventory effect, special
items and the effect of changes in fair value:

- The after-tax inventory effect had a negative impact on net income
of €157 milion in 2012 and a positive impact of €834 million in 2011.

- Changes in fair value had a negative impact on net income of
€7 million in 2012 and a positive impact of €32 million in 2011.

- Special items had a negative impact on net income of €1,503 million
in 2012, comprised essentially of an impairment of assets in
the Barnett in the US, provisions for abandonment costs relating
to Elgin in the UK, a one-off tax of 4% on petroleum stocks
in France, an impairment of chemicals assets in Europe, and
a provision relating to a settlement agreement in progress with
the SEC and Dod in the US. These special items were partially
offset by gains on asset sales. In 2011, special items had
a negative impact of €14 million.

Net income (Group share) was €10,694 million compared

to €12,276 million. The effective tax rate for the Group was 56.2%
in 2012 compared to 58.4% in 2011. On December 31, 2012,
there were 2,270.4 million fully-diluted shares compared to 2,263.8
million on December 31, 2011.

In 2012, adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share, based on 2,266.6
million fully-diluted weighted-average shares, was €5.45, an increase
of 8% compared to €5.06 in 2011.

Expressed in dollars, adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share was
$7.01 compared to $7.05 in 2011, a decrease of 1%.

1.2.4. Investments - divestments

Investments, excluding acquisitions and including changes in
non-current loans, were €18.5 billion ($23.8 billion) in 2012 compared
to €14.8 billion ($20.6 billion) in 2011, due to an increase in investments
relating to new Upstream projects under development.

Acquisitions were €3.1 billion ($4.0 billion) in 2012, comprised
essentially of the acquisition of interests in exploration and production
licenses in Uganda, an additional 1.3% stake in Novatek“!, various

(1) Special items affecting operating income from the business segments had a negative impact of €2,342 milion in 2012 and a negative impact of €873 milion in 2011.
(2) Dollar amounts represent euro amounts converted at the average €-$ exchange rate for the period: 1.2848 $/€ for the full year 2012; 1.3920 $/€ for the full year 2011; 1.3257 $/€ for the full year 2010.

Summary of results and financial position

Expressed in dollars, net investments in 2012 decreased 1%, mainly
due to a significant decrease in acquisitions compared to 2011.

of 6%. Expressed in dollars, adjusted net operating income from

the Upstream segment was $14.4 billion, a decrease of 3% compared
to 2011 explained mainly by the decrease in hydrocarbon production,
since the increase technical costs (as discussed below) was largely
offset by the decrease in the effective tax rate for the Upstream.

Technical costs for consolidated subsidiaries, in accordance

with ASC 9328, were 22.8 $/boe in 2012, compared to 18.9 $/boe

In 2012, refinery throughput decreased by 4% compared to 2011, reflecting essentially the portfolio effect relating to the sale of the Group's
interest in CEPSA at the end of July 2011 and the closure of the Rome refinery at the end of the third quarter 2012. Excluding these portfolio
effects, throughput increased by 4% due to increased availability of the Group's refineries. As in 2011, 2012 was marked by higher levels

of planned maintenance at European refineries, in particular the temporary shut-down of the Normandy refinery during the upgrading project
at the end of 2012, as well as scheduled maintenance at the Provence and Feyzin refineries.

compared with 23.0% on December 31, 2011.

2.3. Borrowing requirements and funding structure

The Group's policy consists of incurring non-current debt primarily
at a floating rate, or, if the opportunity arises at the time of an issuance,
at a fixed rate. Debt is incurred in dollars, euros or Canadian dollars
according to general Corporate needs. Long-term interest rate

and currency swaps may be used to hedge bonds at their issuance
in order to create a variable or fixed rate synthetic debt. In order

to partially modify the interest rate structure of the long-term debt,
TOTAL may also enter into long-term interest rate swaps.

The non-current debt is generally raised by the Corporate treasury
entities either directly in dollars, euros or Canadian dollars, or in other
currencies which are then exchanged for dollars, euros or Canadian
dollars through swap issues to appropriately match general
Corporate needs.

The Group has established standards for market transactions under
which bank counterparties must be approved in advance, based
on an assessment of the counterparty's financial soundness
(multi-criteria analysis including a review of the market capitalization
and of the Credit Default Swap (CDS), its ratings with Standard &
Poor's and Moody's, which must be of high quality, and its overall
financial condition).

(1) Cash flow from operations at replacement cost before changes in working capital
(2) Net cash flow = cash flow from operations + divestments - gross investments.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

An overall authorized credit limit is set for each bank and is allotted
among the subsidiaries and the Group's central treasury entities
according to their needs.

To reduce the market values risk on its commitments, in particular
for swaps set as part of bonds issuance, the Group also developed a
system of margin call that is implemented with significant counterparties.

2.4. External financing available

As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate amount of the major
confirmed credit facilities granted by international banks to Group
companies (including TOTAL S.A.) was $11,328 million (compared
with $11,447 million on December 31, 2011), of which $10,921 million
were unused ($11,154 million unused on December 31, 2011).

TOTAL S.A. has confirmed credit facilities granted by international
banks, which allow the Company to fund a significant cash reserve.
As of December 31, 2012, these credit facilities amounted to $10,519
million (compared with $10,139 million on December 31, 2011), of
which $10,463 million were unused (compared with $10,096 million
unused on December 31, 2011).

2.5. Anticipated sources of financing

Investments, working capital and dividend payments are financed
essentially by the cash flow generated from operating activities,
asset disposals and, if necessary, by net borrowings.

3. Research & Development

In 2012, Research & Development (R&D) expenses amounted

to €805 million, compared with €776 million in 2011 and €715 million
in 2010. The process initiated in 2004 to increase R&D budgets
continued in 2012.

The portfolio managed by the entity tasked with developing SMEs
specialized in innovative energy technologies and cleantechs has
grown regularly since 2009.

In 2012, 4,110 people were dedicated to R&D activities, compared
with 3,946 in 2011 and 4,087 in 2010. This is mainly due to changes
in the scope of the Group's activities.

There are six major R&D focuses at TOTAL:

- developing knowledge, tools and technological mastery to discover
and profitably operate complex oil and gas resources to help meet
the global demand for energy;

- developing and industrializing solar, biomass and carbon capture
and storage technologies to help prepare for future energy needs;

developing practical, innovative and competitive materials

and products that meet customers’ specific needs, contribute

to the emergence of new features and systems, enable current
materials to be replaced by materials showing higher performance
for users, and address the challenges of improved energy efficiency,
lower environmental impact and toxicity, better management

of their life cycle and waste recovery;

- developing, industrializing and improving first-level competitive
processes for the conversion of oil, coal and biomass resources.
to adapt to changes in resources and markets, improve reliability
and safety, achieve better energy efficiency, reduce the environmental
footprint and maintain the Group's economic margins in the long term;

Management Report
Research & Development

The agreements for the lines of credit granted to TOTAL S.A. do not
contain conditions related to the Company's financial ratios, to its
financial ratings from specialized agencies, or to the occurrence of
events that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position.

Credit facilities granted to Group companies other than TOTAL S.A.
are not intended to finance the Group’s general needs; they are
intended to finance either the general needs of the borrowing
subsidiary or a specific project.

As of December 31, 2012, no restrictions applied to the use
of the Group companies’ capital (including TOTAL S.A.) that could
significantly impact the Group's activities, directly or indirectly.

For the coming years and based on the current financing conditions,
the Company intends to maintain this method of financing the Group's
investments and activities.

— understanding and measuring the impacts of the Group's operations
and products on ecosystems (water, soil, air, biodiversity) to improve
environmental safety, as part of the regulation in place, and reduce
their environmental footprint to achieve sustainability in the Group's
operations; and

— mastering and using innovative technologies such as biotechnologies,
materials sciences, nanotechnologies, high-performance computing,
information and communications technologies and new analytic
techniques.

These issues are addressed synergistically within a portfolio of projects.
Different aspects may be looked at independently by different divisions.

Management Report
Research & Development

3.1. Upstream

3.1.1. Exploration & Production

In addition to continuously optimizing the development of deep-
offshore projects and gas resources, TOTAL continues to improve
its computing, exploration, seismic acquisition and processing tools
in the long term as well as those for the initial appraisal of hydrocarbon
reservoirs and simulation of field evolution during operations,
especially for tight, very deep or carbonated reservoirs.

R&D activity has been intensified in the shale gas and oil sector,
with a strong focus on water management throughout the production
cycle and the search for alternatives to hydraulic fracking.

In 2012, the Group decided to join the consortium that is developing
the Intersect simulator. The Group also launched a major effort to
develop exploration and operational technologies in very cold regions.

Enhancing oil recovery from mature reservoirs and recovery of heavy
cil and bitumen with lesser environmental impacts are also subjects

3.2. Refining & Chemicals

3.2.1. Refining & Petrochemicals

R&D in the realm of refining and petrochemicals came under review
in 2012 as part of the reorganization of the Group. The priorities are:

- to make the best possible use of synergy between industrial units;

to maximize value creation, by benefiting from diversified resources;

to continuously improve the safety, performance and energy
efficiency of processes through a better understanding of the
mechanisms involved and the relations between the structure
and the properties of the loads and products;

to propose a differentiated variety of products to meet the market's
needs, and in particular for fuels and polymers;

to give the Group the means of meeting the environmental
obligations of its units and products, as part of its drive for
continuous improvement.

In Refining & Chemicals, TOTAL is preparing for the emergence of
tomorrow's resources, including non-conventional oil and biomass,
and develops products that meet the market's needs, such

as higher-performance and energy-saving fuels and base oils.

Several R&D projects are ongoing in the field of the production
of second-generation biofuels, in partnerships with industrial
manufacturers (the BioTfueL project) or universities.

Sustained efforts are also being made to continuously improve
the performance of processes and to improve the results of the
manufacturing sites.

The development of new grades of polymers remains a cornerstone
of the Petrochemicals strategy. Futerro, the joint venture formed

by Galactic and TOTAL, is the technological leader in the polylactic acid
(PLA) production chain, from monomer production to polymer recycling.

The optimization of the UOP-Total olefin production process from
methanol (MTO/OCP) has reached its objectives. An industrial
project is currently being examined and efforts continue to support
the licensing of this technology.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

involving major research. In particular, new technologies for the
exploitation of oil shales by pyrolysis are being developed.

The oxycombustion CO, capture and storage project in the depleted
Rousse reservoir in Lacg (France) is about to reach the end

of the active reinjection phase, before progressing to the monitoring
phase. The Group now has a strong command of the methods
used to characterize reservoirs for this type of injection. New projects
will look into new and more economical capturing solutions.

Finally, water management and the production of hydrocarbons are
also the subject of increased R&D activities.

3.1.2 Gas & Power

The program to develop new LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) solutions
is continuing.

Finally, through Hutchinson, Bostik and Atotech in the Refining &
Chemicals segment, Petrochemicals is involved in “Materials Sciences”
projects aimed at developing and bringing to light the division's skills
and innovations in the field of materials. The third generation

of the “Total Car Concept” project aims to demonstrate the benefits
of these technologies.

3.2.2. Specialty Chemicals

R&D has strategic importance for the Specialty Chemicals. It is closely
linked to the needs of subsidiaries and industrial customers.

Hutchinson is continuing to pursue its four main areas of research:
energy efficiency, mass reduction, electrification and control, comfort
and safety. Hutchinson develops products and technologies on the
strength of its capacity to formulate original and advanced materials
and its command of the systems in which its products are integrated.
Significant developments have been made in chemical analysis

and digital simulation.

Bostik is focusing its research activities on three technology platforms:
hot-melt adhesives, reactive elastomers and hydraulic polymer-binder
systems. Based on these technologies, R&D is developing practical,
sustainable assembly solutions that meet the needs of markets in
terms of energy efficiency (construction, transport), material
efficiency (health, industry) and environmental impacts throughout
their life cycle.

Atotech is one of the world leaders for integrated production
systems (chemicals, equipment, know-how and service) for industrial
surface finishing and the manufacturing of integrated circuits.
Given the environmental challenges related to electroplating, nearly
half of Atotech’s R&D projects are intended to develop cleaner
technologies and create conditions for the Sustainable
Development of these industries.

3.3. Marketing & Services

3.3.1. Marketing & Services

The Marketing & Services R&D strategy and organization came
under review in 2012 in line with the organization and the challenges
facing the sector.

The priorities are:

the development of fuels, specification and high-performance
additives and heating fuels that meet the market’s needs, such
as the changes in environmental regulations and the adaptation
to new resources, including those from the biomass;

the development of new families of bitumen, by working on
its properties and issues of logistics and product applications;

the development of advanced lubricants for a broad range
of sectors and customers;

the development of analytical and screening methods that
optimize the product development process.

3.4. Environment

Environmental issues are important throughout the Group and are
taken into account in all R&D projects. They involve environmental
risk management, including in particular:

- water management, notably by reducing the use of water from
natural continental environments and by lowering emissions
in compliance with the regulations in force;

- reduction of greenhouse gases through the improvement of energy
efficiency and carbon capture and storage;

3.5. R&D organization

The Group intends to increase R&D in all of its business units through
cross-functional themes and technologies. Attention is paid to
synergies of R&D efforts between business units.

The Group has twenty-one R&D sites worldwide and has developed
approximately 600 partnerships with other industrial groups and
academic or highly specialized research institutes. TOTAL also has
a permanently renewed network of scientific advisors worldwide that
monitor and advise on matters of interest to the Group’s R&D

Management Report
Research & Development

Moreover, know-how in the realm of engine tests and analytical
product characterization is also deemed to be critical.

3.3.2. New Energies

R&D efforts in New Energies cover both the production processes
of SunPower cells, which aim to speed up the reduction of production
costs, and the future generations of photovoltaic cells, as part

of several partnerships with recognized academic research institutes
and start-ups. In particular, TOTAL is a partner in the important
institutional project, IPVF, launched by the Université Paris-Saclay.

Energy production from biomass is the other major R&D challenge
in the development of New Energies. Through its own biotechnology
research team, the Group is taking part in a program to develop
several production processes using biomass, and in biotechnological
projects to transform the biomass into advanced biofuels or molecules
that can be used in chemical applications. The Group's main
partnership is with Amyris, in which the Group holds a stake.

— detection and reduction of emissions into the air and simulation
of their dissemination;

- prevention of soil contamination and regulatory compliance
with regard to historical aspects and the rehabilitation of sites;

- changes in the Group's different products and management of
their life cycle, in particular in compliance with the REACH Directive.

activities. Long-term partnerships with universities and academic
laboratories, deemed strategic in Europe, the United States, Japan
and China, as well as innovative small businesses are part of the
Group's approach.

Each segment is developing an active intellectual property activity,
aimed at protecting its innovations, allowing its activity to develop
without constraints as well as facilitating its partnerships. In 2012,
more than 250 new patent applications were issued by the Group.

Management Report
Trends and outlook

4. Trends and outlook

4.1. Outlook

To create profitable and sustainable growth, TOTAL invests in
value-creating projects and optimizes its portfolio, in particular by
divesting non-core assets and subsidiaries with limited growth
potential or those in which the Group has a low working interest.

The net investment budget of TOTAL for 2013 is $22 billion, stable
compared to 2011 and 2012. In executing its 2012-14 asset sale
program of $15-20 billion, the Group sold $6 billion of assets in 2012
and anticipates reaching the low-end of its target range by the end
of 2013 with the closing of the Usan sale and other divestments
already in progress. The organic investment budget for 2013 is $28
billion, more than 80% of which will be dedicated to Upstream,
principally for highly competitive and profitable projects scheduled
to start-up before 2017.

The Group also confirms its commitment with respect to R&D with
a budget of about $1.3 billion in 2013.

In the Upstream, TOTAL confirms its production growth targets for
2015, 3% per year on average over the period 2011-2015, and for
2017, a potential of 3 Mboe/d, all based on improved visibility.
TOTAL is focused on delivering its projects on time and in budget.
In 2013, production growth should be fueled by 2012 start-ups as
well as anticipated 2013 start-ups, including Anguille in Gabon,
Angola LNG, Kashagan in Kazakhstan, and the extension of OML
58 in Nigeria. In addition, the Group continues to work in

4.2. Risks and uncertainties

Due to the nature of its business, the Group's activities remain
subject to the usual market risks (sensitivity to the environmental
parameters of the oil and financial markets), industrial and environmental
risks related to its operations, and to political or geopolitical

risks stemming from the global presence of most of its activities.

Risks relative to cash management operations and to interest rate
and foreign exchange financial instruments are managed according

cooperation with the UK authorities towards a safe and progressive
restart of Elgin-Franklin during the first quarter 2013. Visibility on the
Group's production growth targets will be further enhanced this year
by the launch of additional major projects, notably in West Africa.

The exploration budget has been increased to $2.8 billion for 2013,
and the high-potential exploration program for 2013 reflects the new
dynamic of the Group, with prospects to be drilled in Céte d'Ivoire,
Gabon, Kenya, and Brazil.

In Refining & Chemicals, the restructuring in progress should yield
productivity gains and provide synergies in 2013, and in turn contribute
to increased profitability, in line with the objective of a segment
ROACE of 13% in 2015. The year 2013 also should be highlighted
by the start-up of Jubail in Saudi Arabia. This fully-integrated refinery
will have a 400 kb/d capacity for heavy crude and will provide
refined products to growth markets like the Middle East and Asia.

Marketing & Services seeks to continue to strengthen its worldwide
positions and to capitalize on its ability to respond to its customers’
needs. New Energies will pursue its productivity, development,

and innovation programs to increase its contribution.

The Group confirms its commitment in favor of a competitive policy
for returns to shareholders, in keeping with its objective of
sustainable growth.

4 Risk factors
Financial risks

1. Financial risks

Financial risks are detailed in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (point 7., Chapter 9).

1.1. Sensitivity to market environment

The financial performance of TOTAL is sensitive to a number of
factors, the most significant being crude oil and natural gas prices,
refining margins and exchange rates, in particular that of the dollar
versus the euro.

Generally, a rise in the price of crude oil has a positive effect on
earnings as a result of an increase in revenues from oil and gas
production. Conversely, a decline in crude oil prices reduces
revenues. For the year 2013, according to the scenarios retained,
the Group estimates that an increase or decrease of $1.00 per
barrel in the price of Brent crude would respectively increase or
decrease the annual adjusted net operating income by
approximately €0.11 billion ($0.14 billion’). The impact of changes
in crude oil prices on downstream operations depends upon

the speed at which the prices of finished products adjust to reflect
these changes. The Group estimates that an increase or decrease
in European refining margins (ERMI) of $1.00 per ton would
increase or decrease the annual adjusted net operating income
by approximately €0.05 billion ($0.06 billion").

All of the Group's activities are, to various degrees, sensitive to
fluctuations in the dollar/euro exchange rate. The Group estimates
that a strengthening or weakening of the dollar against the euro

by $0.10 per euro would respectively improve or reduce the annual
adjusted net operating income, expressed in euro, by
approximately €0.95 billion.

The Group's results, particularly in the Chemicals activity, also

1.2. Oil and gas market related risks

Due to the nature of its business, the Group has significant oil and
gas trading activities as part of its day-to-day operations in order
to optimize revenues from its oil and gas production and to obtain
favorable pricing to supply its refineries.

In its international oil trading business, the Group follows a policy

of not selling its future production. However, in connection with this
trading business, the Group, like most other oil companies, uses
energy derivative instruments to adjust its exposure to price
fluctuations of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, power and
coal. The Group also uses freight rate derivative contracts in its
shipping business to adjust its exposure to freight-rate fluctuations.
To hedge against this risk, the Group uses various instruments such
as futures, forwards, swaps and options on organized markets

or over-the-counter markets. The list of the different derivatives held
by the Group in these markets is detailed in Note 30 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) Calculated with a base case exchange rate of $1.30 per €1.00.

The Trading & Shipping division measures its market risk exposure,
i.e. potential loss in fair values, on its crude oil, refined products
and freight rates trading activities using a value-at-risk technique.
This technique is based on an historical model and makes an
assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes
in market values over a 24-hour period. The calculation of the range
of potential changes in fair values takes into account a snapshot of
the end-of-day exposures and the set of historical price movements
for the last 400 business days for all instruments and maturities in
the global trading activities. Options are systematically re-evaluated
using appropriate models.

The potential movement in fair values corresponds to a 97.5%
value-at-risk type confidence level. This means that the Group's
portfolio result is likely to exceed the value-at-risk loss measure
once over 40 business days if the portfolio exposures were left
unchanged.

1.3. Financial markets related risks

As part of its financing and cash management activities, the Group
uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to changes in
interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These instruments are
mainly interest rate and currency swaps. The Group may also
occasionally use futures contracts and options. These operations
and their accounting treatment are detailed in Notes 1 paragraph
M, 20, 28 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

numerous independent operators, including other oil companies,
major energy producers or consumers and financial institutions.
The Group has established counterparty limits and monitors
outstanding amounts with each counterparty on an ongoing basis.

Excess cash of the Group is deposited mainly in government
institutions, deposit banks, or major companies through deposits,
reverse repurchase agreements and purchase of commercial paper.
Liquidity positions and the management of financial instruments are
centralized by the Treasury Department, where they are managed
by a team specialized in foreign exchange and interest rate market
transactions.

The Cash Monitoring-Management Unit within the Treasury
Department monitors limits and positions per bank on a daily basis
and results of the Front Office. This unit also prepares
marked-to-market valuations of used financial instruments and,
when necessary, performs sensitivity analysis.

1.4. Counterparty risk

The Group has established standards for market transactions under
which bank counterparties must be approved in advance, based
on an assessment of the counterparty's financial soundness
(multi-criteria analysis including a review of market prices and

of the Credit Default Swap (CDS), its ratings with Standard & Poor's
and Moody's, which must be of high quality, and its overall

financial condition).

1.5. Currency exposure

The Group seeks to minimize the currency exposure of each entity
to its functional currency (primarily the euro, the dollar, the
Canadian dollar, the pound sterling and the Norwegian krone).

For currency exposure generated by commercial activity, the
hedging of revenues and costs in foreign currencies is typically
performed using currency operations on the spot market and,

in some cases, on the forward market. The Group rarely hedges.
future cash flows, although it may use options to do so.

With respect to currency exposure linked to non-current assets
booked in a currency other than the euro, the Group has a policy
of reducing the related currency exposure by financing these
assets in the same currency.

Net short-term currency exposure is periodically monitored against
limits set by the Group's senior management.

An overall authorized credit limit is set for each bank and is allotted
among the subsidiaries and the Group's central treasury entities
according to their needs.

To reduce the market values risk on its commitments, in particular
for swaps set as part of bonds issuance, the Treasury Department
also developed a system of margin call that is gradually implemented
with significant counterparties.

The non-current debt described in Note 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements is generally raised by the Corporate treasury
entities either directly in dollars, in euros or in Canadian dollars,

or in other currencies which are then exchanged for dollars or euros
through swaps issues to appropriately match general Corporate
needs. The proceeds from these debt issuances are loaned to
affiliates whose accounts are kept in dollars, in Canadian dollars

or in euros. Thus, the net sensitivity of these positions to currency
exposure is not significant.

The Group's short-term currency swaps, the notional value of which
appears in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

are used to attempt to optimize the centralized cash management
of the Group. Thus, the sensitivity to currency fluctuations which
may be induced is likewise considered negligible.

The Group's policy consists of incurring non-current debt primarily
at a floating rate, or, if the opportunity arises at the time of an
issuance, at a fixed rate. Debt is incurred in dollars, in euros or in
Canadian dollars according to general corporate needs of the Group.

As a result of the policy for the management of currency exposure previously described, the Group's sensitivity to currency exposure
is primarily influenced by the net equity of the subsidiaries whose functional currency is the dollar and, to a lesser extent, the pound sterling,

the Norwegian krone and the Canadian dollar.

This sensitivity is reflected in the historical evolution of the currency translation adjustment recorded in the statement of changes
in shareholders’ equity which, in the course of the last three fiscal years, is essentially related to the fluctuation of dollar and pound sterling

and is set forth in the table below:

As a result of this policy, the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on consolidated income, as illustrated in Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, has not been significant over the last three years despite the considerable fluctuation of the dollar

(again of €26 million in 2012, a gain of €118 million in 2011, nil result in 2010).

1.9. Stock market risk

The Group holds interests in a number of publicly-traded companies (see Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
The market value of these holdings fluctuates due to various factors, including stock market trends, valuations of the sectors in which the

companies operate, and the economic and financial condition of each individual company.

1.10. Liquidity risk

TOTAL S.A. has confirmed lines of credit granted by international
banks, which are calculated to allow it to manage its short-term
liquidity needs as required.

As of December 31, 2012, these lines of credit amounted to $10,519
million, of which $10,463 million was unused. The agreements for
the lines of credit granted to TOTAL S.A. do not contain conditions
related to the Company's financial ratios, to its financial ratings from
specialized agencies, or to the occurrence of events that could

have a material adverse effect on its financial position. As of
December 31, 2012, the aggregate amount of the principal
confirmed lines of credit granted by international banks to Group
companies, including TOTAL S.A., was $11,328 million, of which
$10,921 million was unused. The lines of credit granted to Group
companies other than TOTAL S.A. are not intended to finance the
Group's general needs; they are intended to finance either the
general needs of the borrowing subsidiary or a specific project.

As part of its credit risk management related to operating and
financing activities, the Group has developed margin call contracts
with certain counterparties. As of December 31, 2012, the net
amount received as part of these margin calls was €1,635 million
(against €1,682 million as of December 31, 2011 and

€1,560 million as of December 31, 2010).

Credit risk is managed by the Group's business segments
as follows:

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

Upstream segment
- Exploration & Production

Risks arising under contracts with government authorities or other
oil companies or under long-term supply contracts necessary for
the development of projects are evaluated during the project
approval process. The long-term aspect of these contracts and the
high-quality of the other parties lead to a low level of credit risk.

Risks related to commercial operations, other than those described
above (which are, in practice, directly monitored by subsidiaries),
are subject to procedures for establishing and reviewing credit.


--- Page 71 ---

Customer receivables are subject to provisions on a case-by-case
basis, based on prior history and management's assessment of the
facts and circumstances.

- Gas & Power

Gas & Power deals with counterparties in the energy, industrial
and financial sectors throughout the world. Financial institutions
providing credit risk coverage are highly rated international bank
and insurance groups.

Potential counterparties are subject to credit assessment and
approval before concluding transactions and are thereafter subject
to regular review, including re-appraisal and approval of the limits
previously granted.

The creditworthiness of counterparties is assessed based on

an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data regarding financial
standing and business risks, together with the review of any
relevant third party and market information, such as data published
by rating agencies. On this basis, credit limits are defined for each
potential counterparty and, where appropriate, transactions are
subject to specific authorizations.

Credit exposure, which is essentially an economic exposure or
an expected future physical exposure, is permanently monitored
and subject to sensitivity measures.

Credit risk is mitigated by the systematic use of industry standard
contractual frameworks that permit netting, enable requiring added
security in case of adverse change in the counterparty risk, and
allow for termination of the contract upon occurrence of certain
events of default.

Refining & Chemicals segment
- Refining & Chemicals

Credit risk is primarily related to commercial receivables. Each
business unit implements procedures for managing and
provisioning credit risk that differ based on the size of the subsidiary
and the market in which it operates. The principal elements of these
procedures are:

— implementation of credit limits with different authorization
procedures for possible credit overruns;

- use of insurance policies or specific guarantees (letters of credit);

- regular monitoring and assessment of overdue accounts
(aging balance), including collection procedures; and

- provisioning of bad debts on a customer-by-customer basis,
according to payment delays and local payment practices
(provisions may also be calculated based on statistics).

- Trading & Shipping

Trading & Shipping deals with commercial counterparties and
financial institutions located throughout the world. Counterparties
to physical and derivative transactions are primarily entities involved
in the oil and gas industry or in the trading of energy commodities,
or financial institutions. Credit risk coverage is concluded with
financial institutions, international banks and insurance groups
selected in accordance with strict criteria.

Risk factors
Financial risks

Trading & Shipping has a strict policy of internal delegation of
authority governing establishment of country and counterparty
credit limits and approval of specific transactions. Credit exposures
contracted under these limits and approvals are monitored on a
daily basis.

Potential counterparties are subject to credit assessment and
approval prior to any transaction being concluded and all active
counterparties are subject to regular reviews, including re-appraisal
and approval of granted limits. The creditworthiness of counterparties
is assessed based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative
data regarding financial standing and business risks, together with
the review of any relevant third party and market information, such
as ratings published by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors
Service and other agencies.

Contractual arrangements are structured so as to maximize the risk
mitigation benefits of netting between transactions wherever
possible and additional protective terms providing for the provision
of security in the event of financial deterioration and the termination
of transactions on the occurrence of defined default events are
used to the greatest permitted extent.

Credit risks in excess of approved levels are secured by means of
letters of credit and other guarantees, cash deposits and insurance
arrangements. In respect of derivative transactions, risks are
secured by margin call contracts wherever possible.

Marketing & Services segment

Internal procedures for Marketing & Services business unit include
rules on credit risk that describe the basis of internal control in this
domain, including the separation of authority between commercial
and financial operations. Credit policies are defined at the local
level, complemented by the implementation of procedures to
monitor customer risk (credit Committees at the subsidiary level,
the creation of credit limits for Corporate customers, portfolio
guarantees, etc.).

Each entity also implements monitoring of its outstanding
receivables. Risks related to credit may be mitigated or limited
by subscription of credit insurance and/or requiring security
or guarantees.

Bad debts are provisioned on a case-by-case basis at a rate
determined by management based on an assessment of the risk
of credit loss.

2. Industrial and environmental risks

2.1. Types of risks

TOTAL is exposed to risks related to the safety and security
of its operations.

TOTAL engages in a broad scope of activities, which include
drilling, oil and gas production, processing, transportation, refining
and petrochemical activities, storage and distribution of petroleum
products, and production of base and specialty chemicals, and
involve a wide range of operational risks. These risks include
explosions, fires, accidents, equipment failures, leakage of toxic
products, emissions or discharges into the air, water or soil, and
related environmental and health risks. In the transportation area,

the type of risk depends not only on the hazardous nature of the
products transported, but also on the transportation methods used
(mainly maritime, river-maritime, pipelines, rail and road), the
volumes involved, and the sensitivity of the regions through which
the transport passes (quality of infrastructure, population density,
environmental considerations). Most of the Group's activities

will also eventually require environmental site remediation, closure
and decommissioning after production is discontinued.

The following table shows a correlation between TOTAL's operations
and the most significant industrial and environmental risks:

Activity/Risk Fire, Leakage Accidental Pollution Consumer Emissions into

Transport of petroleum products and chemicals x x x x - x
Refining, petrochemicals x x x x x x

Specialty chemicals x x x x x x

The industrial events that could have the most significant impact
are primarily:

— a maior industrial accident (fire, explosion, leakage of highly
toxic products);

- large-scale accidental pollution.

All the risks described correspond to events that could potentially
cause death, damage property, disrupt business activities, cause
environmental damage or harm human health. Group’s employees,
contractors, residents living near the facilities or customers can
suffer injuries. Property damage can involve the facilities of the
Group as well as the property of third parties. The seriousness of
the consequences of these events varies according to the
vulnerability of the people, ecosystems and business activities
impacted, on the one hand, and the number of people in

the impact area and the location of the ecosystems and business
activities in relation to TOTAL’s facilities or to the trajectory of the
products after the event, on the other hand.

Acts of terrorism against the Group's plants and sites, pipelines,
transportation or computer systems could also severely disrupt
business and operations and could cause harm to people and
property damage.

Like most industrial groups, TOTAL is concerned by reports of
occupational illnesses, particularly those caused by past exposure
of the Group's employees to asbestos. Asbestos exposure has
been subject to close monitoring at all of the Group's business
segments. As of December 31, 2012, the Group estimates that
the ultimate cost of all pending or future asbestos-related claims is
not likely to have a material impact on the Group's financial position.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

Certain segments or activities face specific additional risks.

TOTAL's Upstream segment activities face risks related to the
physical characteristics of oil or gas fields. These risks include
eruptions of oil or gas, discovery of hydrocarbon pockets with
abnormal pressure, crumbling of well openings, leaks that can harm
the environment and explosions or fires. These events, which may
cause injury, death or environmental damage, can also damage

or destroy oil or gas wells as well as equipment and other property,
lead to a disruption of the Group's operations or reduce its production.
In addition, since exploration and production activities may take
place on sites that are ecologically sensitive (for example, in tropical
forests or in a marine environment), each site requires a risk-based
approach to avoid or minimize the impact on human health, flora
and fauna, the ecosystem and biodiversity. In certain situations
where the operator is not a Group entity, the Group may have
reduced influence and control over third parties, which may limit

its ability to manage and control these risks.

The activities of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services
business segments also entail additional health, safety and
environmental risks related to the overall life cycle of the products
manufactured, as well as the raw materials used in the manufacturing
process, such as catalysts, additives and monomers. These risks
can arise from the intrinsic characteristics of the products involved
(flammability, toxicity, or long-term environmental impacts such as
greenhouse gas emissions), their use (including by customers),
emissions and discharges resulting from their manufacturing process,
and from recycling or disposing of materials and wastes at the end
of their useful life.


--- Page 73 ---

Contracts signed by the Group's entities may provide for
indemnification obligations either by TOTAL in favor of third parties
or by third parties for the benefit of TOTAL if, for example, an event
occurs leading to death, personal injury, property damage or
discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. With
respect to joint ventures the assets of which are operated by an
entity of the Group, contractual terms generally provide that this
entity assumes liability for damage caused by its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. With respect to joint ventures in which an
entity of the Group has an interest but the assets of which are
operated by others, contractual terms generally provide that the
operator assumes liability for damages caused by its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. All other liabilities of these types
of joint venture are generally assumed by the partners in proportion
to their respective ownership interests. With respect to third party
providers of goods and services, the amount and nature of the
liability assumed by the third party depends on the context and
may be limited by contract. With respect to their customers, the
Group's entities seek to ensure that their products meet applicable
specifications and abide by all applicable consumer protection
laws. Failure to do so could lead to personal injury, environmental
harm, regulatory violations and loss of customers, and could
negatively impact the Group's results of operations, financial
condition and reputation.

To manage these risks, TOTAL maintains worldwide third-party
liability insurance coverage for all its subsidiaries. TOTAL also
maintains insurance to protect against the risk of damage to Group
property and/or business interruption at its main refining and
petrochemical sites. TOTAL's insurance and risk management
policies are described in point 4. of this Chapter (“Insurance and
risk management”).

Cri management systems are necessary to respond
effectively to emergencies and to avoid potential disruptions
in TOTAL’s business and operations.

TOTAL has crisis management plans in place to deal with
emergencies, such as the leak in the Elgin field in the North Sea
(see Chapter 12, paragraph 2.2.3.). If TOTAL does not respond

to such emergencies in an appropriate manner, its business and
operations could be severely disrupted. TOTAL also has
implemented business continuity plans in order to continue or
resume operations following a shutdown or incident (see paragraph
2.2.3. below). An inability to timely restore or replace critical
capacity could prolong the impact of any disruption and could have
a material adverse effect on the Group's business and operations.

TOTAL is subject to stringent environmental, health and safety
laws in numerous countries and may incur material costs
to comply with these laws and regulations.

TOTAL's workforce and the public are exposed to risks inherent to
the Group's operations that potentially could lead to loss of life,
injuries, property damage or environmental damage and could result
in regulatory action and legal liability against the entities of the
Group and damage to its reputation.

TOTAL incurs, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures
to comply with increasingly complex laws and regulations aimed at
protecting worker health and safety and the natural environment.

These expenditures include:

— costs incurred to prevent, control, eliminate or reduce certain
types of air and water emissions, including those costs incurred
in connection with government action to address climate change;

Risk factors
Industrial and environmental risks

— remedial measures related to environmental contamination or
accidents at various sites, including those owned by third parties;

— compensation of persons claiming damages caused by the Group's
activities or accidents;

- increased production costs or costs related to changes in product
specifications or sales; and

- costs related to the decommissioning of drilling platforms
and other facilities.

If the Group's financial reserves prove inadequate, such expenditures.
incurred could have a material effect on the results of operations of
the Group and its financial position.

Furthermore, in countries where the Group operates or plans to
operate, the introduction of new laws and regulations, stricter
enforcement or news interpretations of existing laws and regulations
or the imposition of tougher license requirements may also cause
the Group's entities to incur higher costs resulting from actions
taken to comply with such laws and regulations, including:

— modifying operations;

— installing pollution control equipment;

implementing additional safety measures; and
- performing site clean-ups.

As a further result of the introduction of any new laws and
regulations or other factors, the Group could also be compelled to
curtail, modify or cease certain operations or implement temporary
shutdowns of facilities, which could diminish the Group's
productivity and materially and adversely impact its results of
operations, including its profits.

All TOTAL entities monitor legal and regulatory developments in
order to remain in compliance with local and international rules and
standards for the assessment and management of industrial

and environmental risks. With regard to the permanent shutdown
of an activity, the Group's environmental contingencies and asset
retirement obligations are addressed in the “Asset retirement
obligation” and “Provisions for environmental contingencies” sections
of the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, Chapter 9, point 7.). Future
expenditures related to asset retirement obligations are accounted
for in accordance with the accounting principles described in Note
1Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Chapter 9, point 7.).

Laws and regulations related to climate change and its physical
effects may adversely affect the Group’s business.

Growing public concern in a number of countries over greenhouse
gas emissions and climate change, as well as a multiplication of
stricter regulations in this area, could adversely affect the Group's
businesses and product sales, increase its operating costs and
reduce its profitability.

The regulation concerning the market for CO, emission allowances
in Europe, EU-ETS (European Trading Scheme), entered a third
phase on January 1, 2013. This phase marks the end of the overall
free allocation of emission allowances, particularly for electricity
production plants, which no longer benefit from free allowances,
and establishes allowance auctioning by the States. The Group is
impacted in Europe by this new phase of the regulation, especially
for its refining and petrochemicals facilities and, to a lesser extent,
its Upstream operations. In phase 3, free allocations are limited to
those resulting from a calculation based on a benchmark within the

Registration Document 2012. TOTAL

Industrial and environmental risks

same industrial sector. This benchmark is set on the basis of the
top 10% most efficient installations in terms of emissions.
Installations other than the top 10% must have missing allowances
bought at market price. Moreover, the Group's plants will need to
indirectly bear the cost of allowances for all electricity consumed,
including electricity generated internally at its own facilities.
Although the allocations of free allowances for phase 3 have not yet
been made public, the Group believes that it will continue to receive
free allowances that will cover approximately 80% of its emissions
subject to the EU-ETS during the 2013-2020 period. Given the
amount of free allocations at the beginning of the period and the
ability to use in phase 3 its surplus allowances purchased or
received in phase 2, the Group's exposure should be limited during
the period in question.

In addition, more of TOTAL's future production is expected to come
from unconventional sources in order to help meet the world’s
growing demand for energy. Since energy intensity of oil and gas
production from unconventional sources can be higher than that

of production from conventional sources, the CO emissions
produced by the Group's activities may increase. Therefore,

TOTAL may incur additional costs from delayed projects or reduced
production from certain projects.

In addition, TOTAL's business operates in varied locales where

the potential physical impacts of climate change, including changes
in weather patterns, are highly uncertain and may adversely impact
the results of the Group's operations.

2.2. Management and monitoring of industrial and environmental risks

2.2.1. TOTAL policies regarding health,
safety and the environment

TOTAL has developed a “Health Safety Environment Quality
Charter” (Chapter 12, point 2.) which sets out the basic principles
applicable within the Group regarding the protection of people,
property and the environment. This charter is rolled out at several
levels within the Group by means of management systems.

Along these lines, TOTAL has developed efficient organizations as
well as safety, environmental and quality management systems,
which it makes every effort to have certified or assessed (standards
such as the International Safety Rating System, ISO 14001 and
ISO 9001). For example, in 2010, TOTAL received ISO 9001
certification for “development and management of the database

of technical businesses” in Exploration and Production.

In most countries, TOTAL's operations are subject to laws
and regulations concerning environmental protection and Industrial
Safety. The main laws and regulations are:

1) In Europe: IPPC- Large Combustion Plants Directives (recasted
by IED Directive), SEVESO Directive, Pressure Equipment
Directive, Water Framework Directive, Waste Directive,

ETS Directive (CO, quotas), Fuel Directive, REACH and
CLP Regulations.

a)

In France: laws and regulations on natural and technological
risks also apply to several sites.

2

In the United States: several activities are subject to the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA")
Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Materials
and the Superfund Act.

TOTAL ensures compliance with applicable laws and regulations,
including in particular the REACH regulation, the purpose of which
is to protect the health and safety of the employees, producers and
users of chemicals and chemical substances, such as by providing
detailed information through safety data sheets (SDS/ESDS) (see also
Chapter 12, point 2.).

2.2.2. Assessment

As part of its policy, TOTAL systematically assesses risks and impacts
in the areas of industrial safety (particularly technological risks),
the environment and the protection of workers and local residents:

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

prior to approving new projects, investments, acquisitions
and disposals;

periodically during operations (safety studies, environmental
impact studies, health impact studies and risk prevention plan
in France as part of the 2003 legislation on the prevention of
major technological risks);

prior to releasing new substances on the market (toxicological
and ecotoxicological studies and life cycle analyses); and

based on the regulatory requirements of the countries
where these activities are carried out and generally accepted
professional practices.

In countries where prior administrative authorization and
supervision is required, projects are not undertaken without the
authorization of the relevant authorities based on the studies
provided to the authorities.

In particular, TOTAL has developed a common methodology
for analyzing technological risks which must gradually be applied
to all activities carried out by the Group’s companies.

2.2.3. Management

TOTAL develops risk management measures based on risk and
impact assessments. These measures involve facility and structure
design, the reinforcement of safety devices and remedies of
environmental degradations.

In addition to developing organizations and management systems
as described above, TOTAL strives to minimize industrial and
environmental risks inherent in its operations by conducting
thorough inspections and audits, training personnel and raising
awareness among all those involved.

In addition, performance indicators (in the areas of HSE) and risk
monitoring have been put in place, objectives have been set and
action plans have been implemented to achieve these objectives.

Although the emphasis is on preventing risks, TOTAL takes
regular steps to prepare for crisis management based on the risk
scenarios identified.

In particular, TOTAL has developed emergency plans and procedures
to respond to an oil spill or leak. These plans and procedures are
specific to each TOTAL affiliate and adapted to its organization,


--- Page 75 ---

activities and environment and are consistent with the Group plan.
They are reviewed regularly and tested through exercises (see
Chapter 12, point 2).

At the Group level, TOTAL has set up the alert scheme PARAPOL.
(Plan to Mobilize Resources Against Pollution) to facilitate crisis
management and provide assistance by mobilizing both internal
and external resources in the event of pollution of marine, coastal
or inland waters, without geographical restriction. The PARAPOL
procedure is made available to TOTAL subsidiaries and its main
goal is to facilitate access to internal experts and physical response
resources.

Furthermore, TOTAL and its subsidiaries are currently members.

of certain oil spill cooperatives that are able to provide expertise,
resources and equipment in all geographic areas where TOTAL has
operations, including in particular Oil Spill Response Limited, the
CEDRE (Center for Documentation, Research and Experimentation
on Accidental Water Pollution) and Clean Caribbean & Americas.

Following the blow-out on the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico
in 2010 (in which the Group was not involved), TOTAL created three
Task Forces in order to analyze risks and issue recommendations.

In Exploration & Production, Task Force 1 reviewed the safety
aspects of deep offshore drilling operations (well architecture,
design of blow-out preventers, training of personnel based on

3. Other risks

3.1. Economic environment
The operating results and future rate of growth of the Group
are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices.

Prices for oil and natural gas historically have fluctuated widely due to
many factors over which TOTAL has no control. These factors include:

- global and regional economic and political developments in
resource-producing regions, particularly in the Middle East, Africa
and South America;

- global and regional supply and demand;

the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and other producing nations to influence global
production levels and prices;

— prices of unconventional energies as well as changes in the
valorization of oil sands, which may affect the Group's realized
prices, notably under its long-term gas sales contracts and asset
valuations, notably in North America;

- cost and availability of new technology;

- governmental regulations and actions;

- global economic and financial market conditions;
— war or other conflicts;

- changes in demographics, including population growth rates
and consumer preferences; and

lessons learned from serious accidents that have occurred recently
in the industry). Its efforts have led to the implementation of even
more stringent controls and audits on drilling operations.

Task Force 2, in coordination with the Global Industry Response
Group (GIRG) created by the OGP (International Association of

Oil and Gas Producers), is studying deep offshore oil capture and
containment operations in case of a pollution event in deep waters.
Capture devices will be available in several regions of the world
where TOTAL has a strong presence in exploration-production.

Task Force 3 involved plans to fight accidental spills in order to
strengthen the Group's ability to respond to major accidental
pollution, such as a blow-out or a total loss of containment from

an FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading facility).

This initiative has led, in particular, to a sharp increase in the volume
of dispersants available within the Group.

The task forces finalized most of their work in 2012, and the Group
has continued deploying solutions to minimize such risks. Detailed
information on TOTAL's initiatives in the fields of safety and
protection of the environment is provided in Chapter 12.

The Group believes that it is impossible to guarantee that the
contingencies or liabilities related to the above mentioned concerns
will not have a material impact on its business, assets and liabilities,
consolidated financial situation, cash flow or income in the future.

- adverse weather conditions (such as hurricanes) that can disrupt
supplies or interrupt operations of the Group's facilities.

Substantial or extended declines in oil and natural gas prices would
adversely affect TOTAL's results of operations by reducing its
profits. Sensitivity to market environment are described above and
discussed in greater detail in point 1.1. of this Chapter 4.

In addition to the adverse effect on revenues, margins and
profitability from any fall in oil and natural gas prices, a prolonged
period of low prices or other indicators could lead to a review of the
Group's properties and oil and natural gas reserves. Such review
would reflect the Company's view based on estimates,
assumptions and judgments and could result in a reduction in the
Group's reported reserves and/or a charge for impairment that
could have a significant effect on the Group's results in the period in
which it occurs. Lower oil and natural gas prices over prolonged
periods may also reduce the economic viability of projects planned
or in development, negatively impact the asset sale program of the
Group and reduce liquidity, thereby decreasing the Group's ability
to finance capital expenditures and/or causing it to cancel or
postpone investment projects. If TOTAL is unable to follow through
with investment projects, the opportunities for future revenue and
profitability growth with the Group would be reduced, which could
materially impact the Group's financial condition.

However, in a high oil and gas price environment, the Group can
experience significant increases in cost and fiscal take, and, under
some production-sharing contracts, the Group's entitlement to

reserves could be reduced. Higher prices can also reduce demand
for the Group's products.

The Group's downstream earnings are primarily dependent upon
the supply and demand for refined products and the associated

margins on refined product sales, with the impact of changes in oil
and gas prices on downstream earnings being dependent upon the
speed at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect
movements in oil and gas prices.

3.2. Risks related to oil and gas exploration and production

The Group’s long-term profitability depends on cost effective
discovery, acquisition and development of new reserves; if the
Group is unsuccessful, its results of operations and financial
condition would be materially and adversely affected.

A significant portion of the Group revenues and the majority of its
operating income are derived from the sale of oil and gas that the
Group extract from underground reserves developed as part

of its Upstream business. The development of oil and gas fields,
the construction of facilities and the drilling of production or
injection wells is capital intensive, requires advanced technology
and due to difficult environmental challenges, cost projections are
uncertain. In order for this Upstream business to continue to be
profitable, the Group needs to replace depleted reserves with new
proved reserves. Furthermore, the Group needs to accomplish
such replacement in a manner that allows subsequent production
to be economically viable. However, TOTAL's ability to discover or
acquire and develop new reserves successfully is uncertain and can
be negatively affected by a number of factors, including:

- the geological nature of oil and gas fields, notably unexpected
drilling conditions including pressure or irregularities in
geological formations;

the risk of dry holes or failure to find expected commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons;

- equipment failures, fires, blow-outs or accidents;

- the Group's inability to develop or deploy new technologies that
permit access to previously inaccessible fields;

— the Group's inability to anticipate market changes in a timely manner;
— adverse weather conditions;

- compliance with both anticipated and unanticipated
governmental requirements, including U.S. and EU regulations
that may give a competitive advantage to companies not subject
to such regulations;

- shortages or delays in the availability or delivery of appropriate
equipment;

— industrial action;

— competition from publicly held and state-run oil and gas
companies for the acquisition and development of assets and
licenses;

- increased taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims; and
- problems with legal title.

Any of these factors could lead to cost overruns and impair the
Group's ability to make discoveries and acquisitions or complete

a development project, or to make production economical.

It is impossible to guarantee that new reserves of oil and gas will be
discovered in sufficient quantities to replace the Group's reserves
currently being developed, produced and marketed. Furthermore,
some of these factors may also affect the Group's projects and
facilities further down the oil and gas chain. If TOTAL fails to

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

develop new reserves cost-effectively on an ongoing basis, the
results of the Group's operations, including profits, and the Group's
financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected.

The Group’s oil and gas reserves data are only estimates,

and subsequent downward adjustments are possible. If actual
production from such reserves is lower than current estimates
indicate, the Group’s results of operations and financial
condition would be negatively impacted.

The proved reserves figures of the Group are estimates reflecting
applicable reporting regulations as they may evolve. Proved
reserves are those reserves which, by analysis of geosciences and
engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be
economically producible — from a given date forward, from known
reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating
methods and government regulations — prior to the time at which
contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence
indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether
deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
Reserves are estimated by teams of qualified, experienced and
trained geoscientists, petroleum engineers and project engineers,
who rigorously review and analyze in detail all available geosciences
and engineering data (e.g., seismic, electrical logs, cores, fluids,
pressures, flow rates, facilities parameters). This process involves
making subjective judgments, including with respect to the estimate
of hydrocarbons initially in place, initial production rates and
recovery efficiency, based on available geological, technical and
economic data. Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact
measurements and are subject to revision. In addition, they may be
negatively impacted by a variety of factors that are beyond the
Group's control and that could cause such estimates to be
adjusted downward in the future, or cause the Group's actual
production to be lower than its currently reported proved reserves
indicate. The main such factors include:

- adecline in the price of oil or gas, making reserves no longer
economically viable to exploit and therefore not classifiable
as proved;

- an increase in the price of oil or gas, which may reduce the
reserves to which the Group is entitled under production sharing
and risked service contracts and other contractual terms;

- changes in tax rules and other government regulations that make
reserves no longer economically viable to exploit; and

- the actual production performance of the Group's reservoirs.

The Group's reserves estimates may therefore require substantial
downward revisions to the extent its subjective judgments prove
not to have been conservative enough based on the available
geosciences and engineering data, or the Group's assumptions
regarding factors or variables that are beyond its control prove to be
incorrect over time. Any downward adjustment would indicate lower
future production amounts, which could adversely affect the Group's
results of operations, including profits as well as its financial condition.

Risk factors
Other risks

3.3. Major projects and production growth

The Group’s production growth depends on the delivery
of its major development projects.

The Group's targeted production growth relies heavily on the
successful execution of its major development projects, which are
complex and capital-intensive. These major projects are subject to
a number of challenges, including:

— negotiations with partners, governments, suppliers, customers
and others;

- cost overruns and delays related to the availability of skilled labor
or delays in manufacturing and delivery of critical equipment, or
shortages in the availability of such equipment;

3.4. Equity affiliates

Many of the Group’s projects are conducted by equity affiliates.
This may reduce the degree of control, as well as the ability
of the Group to identify and manage risks.

A significant and growing number of the Group's projects are
conducted by equity affiliates. In cases where a company in which
the Group holds an interest is not the operator, it may have limited
influence over, and control of, the behavior, performance and costs

- unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup
or cause unscheduled project downtime;

- the actual performance of the reservoir and natural field decline;
and

— timely issuance or renewal of permits and licenses by
government agencies.

Poor delivery of any major project that underpins production or
production growth could adversely affect the Group's financial
performance.

of the partnership, its ability to manage risks may be limited and

it may, nevertheless, be pursued by regulators or claimants in the
event of an incident. Additionally, the partners of the Group (particularly
local partners in developing countries) may not be able to meet their
financial or other obligations to the projects, which may threaten the
viability of a given project, and they may not have the financial
capacity to fully indemnify the Group in the event of an incident.

3.5. Risks related to economic or political factors

TOTAL has significant production and reserves located

in politically, economically and socially unstable areas, where
the likelihood of material disruption of the Group’s operations
is relatively high.

A significant portion of TOTAL's oil and gas production and reserves
is located in countries outside of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). In recent years, a number
of these countries have experienced varying degrees of one

or more of the following: economic instability, political volatility,

civil war, violent conflict and social unrest and actions of terrorist
groups. Any of these conditions alone or in combination could
disrupt the Group's operations in any of these regions, causing
substantial declines in production. In Africa, which represented
31% of the Group's 2012 combined liquids and gas production,
certain of the countries in which the Group has production have
recently suffered from some of these conditions, including Nigeria,
where the Group had in 2012 its highest hydrocarbon production,
and Libya. The Middle East, which represented 21% of the Group's
2012 combined liquids and gas production, has recently suffered
increased political volatility in connection with violent conflict and
social unrest, including Syria, where European Union (EU) economic
sanctions have prohibited TOTAL from producing oil and gas, and
Yemen. In South America, which represented 8% of the Group's
2012 combined liquids and gas production, certain of the countries
in which TOTAL has production have recently suffered from some
of above-mentioned conditions, including Argentina and Venezuela.
In addition, uncertainties surrounding enforcement of contractual
rights in these regions may adversely impact the Group's results.
Furthermore, in addition to current production, TOTAL is also
exploring for and developing new reserves in other regions of the
world that are historically characterized by political, social and
economic instability, such as the Caspian Sea region where

TOTAL has large projects currently underway. The occurrence

and magnitude of incidents related to economic, social and political
instability are unpredictable. It is possible that they could have a
material adverse impact on the Group’s production and operations
in the future and/or cause certain investors to reduce their holdings
of TOTAL's securities.

TOTAL, like other major international energy companies, has a
geographically diverse portfolio of reserves and operational sites,
which allows it to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to
reduce its exposure to political and economic risks. However, there
can be no assurance that such events will not have a material
adverse impact on the Group.

The Group’s operations throughout emerging countries are subject
to intervention by the governments of these countries, which
could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.

TOTAL has significant exploration and production activities,

and in some cases refining, marketing or chemicals operations, in
developing countries whose governmental and regulatory framework
is subject to unexpected change and where the enforcement of
contractual rights is uncertain. In addition, the Group's exploration
and production activity in such countries is often done in conjunction
with state-owned entities, for example as part of a joint venture,
where the state has a significant degree of control. In recent years,
in various regions globally, TOTAL has seen governments and state-
owned enterprises imposing more stringent conditions on
companies pursuing exploration and production activities in their
respective countries, increasing the costs and uncertainties of its
business operations, which is a trend the Group expects to continue.
Potential increasing intervention by governments in such countries
can take a wide variety of forms, including:

- the award or denial of exploration and production interests;

- the imposition of specific drilling obligations;

Risk factors
Other risks

- price and/or production quota controls and export limits;

— nationalization or expropriation of assets;

- unilateral cancellation or modification of license or contract rights;
— increases in taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims;

- the renegotiation of contracts;

— payment delays; and

- currency exchange restrictions or currency devaluation.

Imposition of any of these factors by a host government in a
developing country where TOTAL has substantial operations,

including exploration, could cause the Group to incur material costs
or cause the Group's production or the value of the Group's assets
to decrease, potentially having a material adverse effect on its
results of operations, including profits.

For example, the Nigerian government has been contemplating
new legislation to govern the petroleum industry which, if passed
into law, could have an impact on the existing and future activities
of the Group in that country through increased taxes and/or costs
of operation and could adversely affect financial returns from
projects in that country.

3.6. Ethical misconduct and non compliance risks

Ethical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws by the Group’s
employees could expose TOTAL to criminal and civil penalties
and be damaging to TOTAL’s reputation and shareholder value.

The Code of Conduct of the Group, which applies to all of its
employees, defines the Group's commitment to integrity,
compliance with all applicable legal requirements, high ethical
standards and the behaviors and actions the Group expects of the
businesses and people of the Group wherever it operates. Ethical
misconduct or non-compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, including non-compliance with anti-bribery,
anticorruption and other applicable laws by TOTAL, its partners,
agents or others that acts on the Group's behalf, could expose
TOTAL and its employees to criminal and civil penalties and could
be damaging to TOTAL's reputation and shareholder value. In
addition to such penalties, a monitor is likely to be appointed to

review the Group’s compliance and internal control procedures.

and may, if need be, recommend improvements of such
procedures. Refer to paragraph 5.6. in Chapter 7 Legal and
arbitration proceedings - Iran for an overview of the investigation
since 2003 by the SEC and Department of Justice (Dou)
concerning the pursuit of business in Iran by certain oil companies,
including TOTAL. At this point, the Company considers that the
resolution of this matter is not expected to have a significant impact
on the Group's financial situation or its future planned operations.

The Group has been deploying ethics and compliance programs
since 2009, as a priority of the General Management. Refer to
paragraph 1.10.1. in Chapter 5 of this Registration Document for
more details.

3.7. Legal aspects of the Group’s activities

3.7.1. Legal aspects of the Upstream
segment’s activities

TOTAL's Upstream segment conducts activities in various countries
which are therefore subject to a broad range of regulations. These
cover virtually all aspects of exploration and production operations,
including leasehold rights, production rates, royalties, environmental
protection, exports, taxes and foreign exchange rates. The terms.
of the concessions, licenses, permits and contracts governing the
Group's ownership of oil and gas interests vary from country to
country. These concessions, licenses, permits and contracts are
generally granted by or entered into with a government entity or a
state-owned company and are sometimes entered into with private
owners. These arrangements usually take the form of concessions
or production sharing contracts.

In the framework of oil concession agreements, the oil company owns
the assets and the facilities and is entitled to the entire production.

In exchange, the operating risks, costs and investments are the oil
Company's responsibility and it agrees to remit to the relevant
State, usually the owner of the subsoil resources, a production-based
royalty, income tax, and possibly other taxes that may apply under
local tax legislation.

The production sharing contract (PSC) involves a more complex
legal framework than the concession agreement: it defines the

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

terms and conditions of production sharing and sets the rules
governing the cooperation between the Company or consortium
in possession of the license and the host State, which is generally
represented by a state-owned company. The latter can thus be
involved in operating decisions, cost accounting and production
allocation.

The consortium agrees to undertake and finance all exploration,
development and production activities at its own risk. In exchange,
it is entitled to a portion of the production, known as “cost oil”, the
sale of which should cover all of these expenses (investments and
operating costs). The balance of production, known as “profit oil”,
is then shared in varying proportions, between the Company or
consortium, on the one hand, and with the State or the state-
owned company, on the other hand.

In some instances, concession agreements and PSCs coexist,
sometimes in the same country. Even though there are other
contractual models, TOTAL's license portfolio is comprised mainly
of concession agreements.

In every country, the authorities of the host State, often assisted by
international accounting firms, perform joint venture and PSC cost
audits and ensure the observance of contractual obligations.

In some countries, TOTAL has also signed contracts called “risked
service contracts”, which are similar to production sharing
contracts. However, the profit oil is replaced by risked monetary


--- Page 79 ---

remuneration, agreed by contract, which depends notably on the
field performance. Thus, the remuneration under the Iraqi contract
is based on an amount calculated per barrel produced.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to
authorization granted by public authorities (licenses), which are granted
for specific and limited periods of time and include an obligation to
return a large portion, or the entire portion in case of failure, of the
area covered by the license at the end of the exploration period.

TOTAL pays taxes on income generated from its oil and gas
production and sales activities under its concessions, production
sharing contracts and risked service contracts, as provided for by
local regulations. In addition, depending on the country, TOTAL’s
production and sales activities may be subject to a number of other
taxes, fees and withholdings, including special petroleum taxes and
fees. The taxes imposed on oil and gas production and sales
activities may be substantially higher than those imposed on other
industrial or commercial businesses.

The legal framework of TOTAL's exploration and production
activities, established through concessions, licenses, permits and
contracts granted by or entered into with a government entity,

a State-owned company or, sometimes, private owners, is subject
to certain risks that, in certain cases, can reduce or challenge the
protections offered by this legal framework.

3.7.2. Legal aspects
of the Group’s other activities

The activities of the Group's Refining & Chemicals and Marketing
& Services are also subject to a wide range of regulations.

In European countries and in the United States, sites and products
are subject to environmental (water, air, soil, noise, protection

of biodiversity, waste management, impact studies, etc.), health
(on-the-job safety, chemical product risks) and safety (safety of
personnel and residents, major risk facilities) regulations. Product
quality and consumer protection are also subject to regulations.
Within the European Union, EU regulations must be transposed into
Member States’ national laws or directly enforced. In such Member

Risk factors
Other risks

States, EU legislation and regulations may be in addition to national
and local government regulations. In addition, in all Member States
of the European Union, industrial facilities operate pursuant

to licenses issued by competent local authorities that are based on
national laws and EU regulations. It is the same in the United States,
where federal rules are in addition to those of the various states.

In other countries where the Group operates, legislation is often
inspired by EU and U.S. regulations. These countries may more
fully develop certain aspects of regulation in particular fields, for
example those relating to protecting water, nature and health.

Irrespective of the particular country in which the Group operates,
TOTAL has developed standards based on best practices existing
in countries with strong regulations and progressively upgrades
policies with respect to these standards.

In addition, depending on the country where the Group operates,
its other activities are subject to specific sector requirements that
impose constraints with respect to, for example, strategic oil
reserves holding requirements or and shipping capacities owned
or in chartered.

3.7.3. Competition law

Competition laws apply to the Group's companies in the vast
majority of countries in which it does business. Violations of
competition laws carry fines and expose the Group and its
employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits. Furthermore, it is
now common for persons or corporations allegedly injured by
violations of competition laws to sue for damages.

The broad range of activities and countries in which the Group
operates requires local analysis, by business segment, of the legal
risks in terms of competition law. Some of the Group's business
segments have already been implementing competition law conformity
plans for a long time. In 2012, a Group policy for compliance with
competition law and prevention of violations in this area was.
adopted. Its deployment is based on a dedicated organization,

the involvement of hierarchies and staff, and a warning process.

3.8. Critical IT system services and information security

Disruption of the Group’s critical IT services or breaches
of information security could adversely affect its operations.

The businesses of the Group depend heavily on the reliability and
security of its information technology (“IT”) systems. If the integrity
of the IT systems were compromised due to, for example, technical
failure or cyber attack, the business operations and assets of the
Group could sustain serious damage, material intellectual property
could be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury,
environmental harm and regulatory violations could occur

potentially having a material adverse effect on the Group's results
of operations, including profits.

The Information Technology Department has developed and
distributed governance and security rules that describe

the recommended infrastructure, organization and procedures to
maintain information systems that are appropriate to the
organization's needs and to limit information security risks.

These rules are implemented across TOTAL under the responsibility
of the various business segments.

3.9. Countries targeted by economic sanctions

TOTAL has activities in certain countries that are targeted

by economic sanctions under relevant U.S. and EU laws,
and if the Group’s activities are not conducted in accordance
with the relevant conditions, TOTAL could be sanctioned

or otherwise penalized.

The United States has adopted various laws and regulations
designed to restrict trade with Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, and
the U.S. Department of State has identified these countries as state
sponsors of terrorism. The European Union (“EU”) has similar
restrictions with respect to Iran and Syria. A violation of these laws
or regulations could result in criminal and material financial penalties,
including being prohibited from transacting in U.S. dollars. The Group
currently has limited marketing and trading activities in Cuba and a
limited presence in Iran and Syria (for more information, see paragraph
3.9.2. below). Since the independence of the Republic of South
Sudan on July 9, 2011, TOTAL is no longer present in Sudan.

3.9.1. U.S. and European restrictions

With respect to Iran, the United States has adopted a number of
measures since 1996 that provide for the possible imposition of
sanctions against non-U.S. companies engaged in certain activities
in and with Iran, especially in Iran's energy sector. The United States
first adopted legislation in 1996 authorizing sanctions against
non-U.S. companies doing business in Iran and Libya (the Iran and
Libya Sanctions Act, referred to as “ILSA"). In 2006, ILSA was
amended to concern only business in Iran (then renamed the Iran
Sanctions Act, referred to as “ISA"). Pursuant to ISA, which as
described below has since been amended and expanded, the
President of the United States is authorized to initiate an
investigation into the activities of non-U.S. companies in Iran's
energy sector and the possible imposition of sanctions against
persons found, in particular, to have knowingly made investments.
of $20 million or more in any 12-month period in the petroleum
sector in Iran. In May 1998, the U.S. government waived the application
of ISA sanctions for TOTAL's investment in the South Pars gas field.
This waiver, which has not been modified since it was granted,
does not address any of TOTAL's other activities in Iran. In each of
the years since the passage of ILSA and until 2007, TOTAL made
investments in Iran in excess of $20 million (excluding the investments
made as part of the development of South Pars). Since 2008,
TOTALs position has consisted essentially in being reimbursed for
its past investments as part of buyback contracts signed between
1995 and 1999 with respect to permits on which the Group is no
longer the operator. Since 2011, TOTAL has had no production in Iran.

ISA was amended in July 2010 by the Comprehensive Iran
Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010 (“CISADA"),
which expanded both the list of activities with Iran that could lead
to sanctions and the list of sanctions available. In particular,
CISADA authorized sanctions for knowingly providing refined
petroleum products above certain monetary thresholds to Iran and
for providing goods, services, technology, information or support
that could directly and significantly either facilitate Iran's domestic
production of refined petroleum products or contribute to Iran's
ability to import refined petroleum products. Investments in the
petroleum sector commenced prior to the adoption of CISADA
appear to remain subject to the pre-amended version of ISA. The
new sanctions added by CISADA would be available with respect
to new investments in the petroleum sector or any other
sanctionable activity occurring on or after July 1, 2010.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

Prior to CISADA’s enactment, TOTAL discontinued potentially
sanctionable sales of refined petroleum products to Iran. On
September 30, 2010, the U.S. State Department announced that
the U.S. government, pursuant to the “Special Rule” provision of
ISA added by CISADA that allows it to avoid making a determination
of sanctionability under ISA with respect to any party that provides
certain assurances, would not make such a determination with
respect to TOTAL. The U.S. State Department further indicated

at that time that, as long as TOTAL acts in accordance with its
commitments, TOTAL will not be regarded as a company of
concern for its past lran-related activities.

Since the applicability of the “Special Rule” to TOTAL was
announced by the U.S. State Department, the United States has
imposed a number of additional measures targeting activities in
Iran. On November 21, 2011, President Obama issued Executive
Order 13590, which authorized sanctions for knowingly, on or after
November 21, 2011, selling, leasing, or providing to Iran goods,
services, technology or support above certain monetary thresholds
that could directly and significantly contribute to the maintenance or
expansion of Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources located in
Iran, or domestic production of petrochemical products. TOTAL.
does not conduct activities in Iran that could be sanctionable under
Executive Order 13590. In any event, there is no provision in
Executive Order 13590 that modifies the aforementioned “Special
Rule”, and the U.S. State Department issued guidance that
completion of existing contracts is not sanctionable under
Executive Order 13590.

On July 30, 2012, President Obama issued Executive Order 13622,
which authorized sanctions for, amongst other activities, (i)
knowingly, on or after July 30, 2012, engaging in a significant
transaction for the purchase or acquisition of petroleum, petroleum
products or petrochemical products from lran, and (ii) materially
assisting, sponsoring or providing financial, material, or
technological support for, or goods or services in support of, the
National Iranian Oil Company, the Naftiran Intertrade Company, or
the Central Bank of Iran. There is no provision in Executive Order
13622 that modifies the aforementioned “Special Rule”. In addition,
Executive Order 13622 contains an exception for the Shah Deniz
gas field pipeline project, in which TOTAL (10%) and Naftiran Intertrade
Company (“NICO”) (10%) participate, to supply natural gas from
the Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe and Turkey. TOTAL
does not conduct activities targeted by Executive Order 13622.

On August 10, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Iran
Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012
(“ITRSHRA"), which, amongst other things, amended ISA and
CISADA. ITRSHRA, like CISADA before it, expanded both the list
of activities with Iran that could lead to sanctions and the list of
sanctions available. Amongst other things, ITRSHRA authorized
sanctions for (i) provision to Iran of goods, services, technology,
information or support above a certain market value that could
directly and significantly facilitate the maintenance or expansion
of Iran's domestic production of refined petroleum products,
including any direct and significant assistance with the
construction, modernization, or repair of petroleum refineries or
infrastructure directly associated with petroleum refineries, (ii)
participation in a joint venture established on or after January 1,
2002 with respect to the development of petroleum resources
outside of Iran where either the Government of Iran is a substantial
partner or investor or where the joint venture could enhance Iran's
ability to develop petroleum resources in Iran, and (iii) owning,


--- Page 81 ---

operating, controlling or insuring a vessel used to transport crude
il from Iran to another country. ITRSHRA also contains an
exception for the Shah Deniz gas field project. TOTAL does not
conduct activities targeted by ITRSHRA.

ITRSHRA also added a new Section 13(r) to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), which
requires TOTAL to disclose whether it or any of its affiliates has
engaged during the calendar year in certain lran-related activities,
including those targeted under ISA, without regard to whether such
activities are sanctionable under ISA, and any transaction or dealing
with the Government of Iran that is not conducted pursuant to a
specific authorization of the U.S. government (see paragraph 3.9.2.,
below). Section 13(r) also requires TOTAL to file a separate notice
to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
concerning any Section 13(r)-related disclosure provided in its
annual report. Following receipt of this notice, the SEC must
transmit a report to the President and Congress, and the President
must initiate an investigation and make a sanctions determination
within 180 days after initiating the investigation. TOTAL believes that
its lran-related activities required to be disclosed by Section 13(r)
are not sanctionable.

Also with regard to Iran, France and the EU have adopted
measures, based on United Nations Security Council resolutions,
which restrict the movement of certain individuals and goods to or
from Iran as well as certain financial transactions with Iran, in each
case when such individuals, goods or transactions are related to
nuclear proliferation and weapons activities or likely to contribute to
their development. In July and October 2010, the EU adopted new
restrictive measures regarding Iran. Among other things, the supply
of key equipment and technology in the following sectors of the oil
and gas industry in Iran are prohibited: refining, Liquefied Natural
Gas, exploration and production. The prohibition extends to
technical assistance, training and financial assistance in connection
with such items. Extension of loans or credit to, acquisition of
shares in, entry into joint ventures with or other participation in
enterprises in Iran (or Iranian-owned enterprises outside of Iran)
engaged in any of the targeted sectors also is prohibited. Moreover,
with respect to restrictions on transfers of funds and on financial
services, any transfer of at least €40,000 or equivalent to or from
an Iranian individual or entity shall require a prior authorization of the
competent authorities of the EU Member States. TOTAL conducts
its activities in compliance with these EU measures.

On January 23, 2012, the Council of the EU prohibited the
purchase, import and transport of Iranian oil and petroleum and
petrochemical products by European persons and by entities
constituted under the laws of an EU Member State. Prior to that
date, TOTAL had ceased these now-prohibited activities.

With respect to Syria, the EU adopted measures in May 2011

with criminal and financial penalties that prohibit the supply of
certain equipment to Syria, as well as certain financial and asset
transactions with respect to a list of named individuals and entities.
These measures apply to European persons and to entities
constituted under the laws of an EU Member State.

In September 2011, the EU adopted further measures, including,
notably, a prohibition on the purchase, import or transportation from
Syria of crude oil and petroleum products. Since early

September 2011, the Group ceased to purchase hydrocarbons.
from Syria. On December 1, 2011, the EU extended sanctions
against, among others, three state-owned Syrian oil firms, including
General Petroleum Corporation, TOTAL's co-contracting partner

in PSA 1988 (Deir Es Zor licence) and the Tabiyeh contract.

Risk factors
Other risks

The U.S. also has various measures regarding Syria. Since early
December 2011, the Group has ceased its activities that contribute
to oil and gas production in Syria.

The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control
(referred to as “OFAC") administers and enforces economic
sanctions programs, some of which are based on the United
Nations Security Council resolutions referred to above, against
targeted foreign countries, territories, entities and individuals
(including those engaged in activities related to terrorism or the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other threats to
the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United
States). The activities that are restricted depend on the sanctions
program and targeted country or parties, and civil and/or criminal
penalties, imposed on a per transaction basis, can be substantial.
These OFAC sanctions generally apply to U.S. persons and
activities taking place in the United States or that are otherwise
subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Sanctions administered by OFAC target,
among others, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. TOTAL does not
believe that these sanctions are applicable to any of its activities in
the OFAC-targeted countries.

In addition, many U.S. states have adopted legislation requiring
state pension funds to divest themselves of securities in any
company with active business operations in Iran, and state
contracts not to be awarded to such companies. State insurance
regulators have adopted similar initiatives relating to investments by
insurance companies in companies doing business with the Iranian
cil and gas, nuclear, and defense sectors. If TOTAL’s presence in
Iran was determined to fall within the prohibited scope of these
laws, and TOTAL was not to qualify for any available exemptions,
certain U.S. institutions holding interests in TOTAL may be required
to sell their interests. If significant, sales of securities resulting from
such laws and/or regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect
on the prices of TOTAL's securities.

TOTAL continues to closely monitor legislative and other
developments in France, the EU and the United States in order to
determine whether its limited activities or presence in sanctioned

or potentially sanctioned jurisdictions could subject TOTAL to the
application of sanctions. TOTAL cannot assure that current or future
regulations or developments will not have a negative impact on its
business or reputation.

3.9.2. Cuba, Iran and Syria

Provided in this section is certain information relating to TOTAL'’s
activities in Cuba and its presence in Iran and Syria. For more
information on U.S. and EU restrictions relevant to TOTAL in these
jurisdictions, see paragraph 3.9.1. above.

Cuba

In 2012, Marketing & Services had limited marketing activities for
the sale of specialty products to non-state entities in Cuba and paid
taxes on such activities. In addition, Trading & Shipping purchased
hydrocarbons pursuant to spot contracts from a state-controlled
entity for approximately €62 million.

Iran

The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012
(“ITRSHRA’"), signed into law by President Obama on August 10,
2012, added a new Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, which requires TOTAL to disclose whether
it or any of its affiliates has engaged during the 2012 calendar year
in certain lran-related activities. While the Group has not engaged
in any activity that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to
subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D)(i) or (D)(ii) of Section 13()(1), affiliates
of TOTAL may be deemed to have engaged in a transaction or dealing
with the government of Iran pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii),

as discussed below.

The Group has no exploration and production activities in Iran.
Some payments are yet to be reimbursed to the Group with respect
to past expenditures and remuneration under buyback contracts
entered into between 1997 and 1999 with the National Iranian Oil
Company (“NIOC") for the development of the South Pars 2&3 and
Dorood fields. With respect to these contracts, development
operations have been completed and the Group, which is no longer
involved in the operation of these fields, has no information on the
production from these fields. The Group maintains a local office in
Iran solely for non-operational functions. In 2012, Total E&P Iran
(100%), Elf Petroleum Iran (99.7%) and Total South Pars 2&3
(99.7%) collectively made payments of approximately €1 million to
the Iranian administration with respect to certain taxes and social
security in relation to payments made in 2012 to the Group under
the Dorood and South Pars 2&3 buyback contracts and the
maintenance of the local office mentioned above and its personnel.
TOTAL did not recognize any revenues or profits from the
aforementioned in 2012. Payments for taxes and social security

are expected to be made in 2013.

In 2012, as part of its ongoing global strategy for the protection

of its intellectual property, TOTAL filed two patent applications in
Iran that it had filed in many other countries. The filing of an
application to obtain a patent in Iran is an activity that OFAC licenses,
and, although TOTAL is not a U.S. person, it believes its activity is
consistent with this license.

Total E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK"), a wholly-owned affiliate of TOTAL,
had limited contacts in 2012 with the Iranian Oil Company UK Ltd
(“IOC”), a subsidiary of NIOC. These contacts related to agreements
governing certain transportation, processing and operation services
formerly provided to a joint venture at the Rhum field in the UK, co-
owned by BP (50%, operator) and IOC (50%), by a joint venture at
the Bruce field between BP (37%, operator), TEP UK (43.25%),
BHP Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Ltd (16%) and Marubeni

Oil & Gas (North Sea) Limited (3.75%) and by TEP UK's Frigg UK
Association pipeline (100%). To TOTAL’s knowledge, no services
have been provided under the aforementioned agreements since
November 2010, when the Rhum field stopped production
following the adoption of EU sanctions, other than critical safety-
related services (/.e., monitoring and marine inspection of the Rhum
facilities). These agreements led to the signature in 2005 of an
agreement by TEP UK and Naftiran Intertrade Co. (“NICO”) (IOC's
parent company and a subsidiary of NIOC) for the purchase by TEP
UK of Rhum field natural gas liquids from NICO. There have been
no purchases under this agreement since November 2010. TEP.
UK's contacts with IOC and NICO in 2012 in regard to the
aforementioned agreements were limited to exchanging letters

and notifications regarding contract administration and declarations
of force majeure. TEP UK may have similar limited contacts with

TOTAL. Registration Document 2012

|OC and NICO in 2013. TOTAL did not recognize any revenues
or profits from the aforementioned in 2012.

The Group does not own or operate any refineries or chemicals
plants in Iran. Until December 2012, at which time TOTAL sold its
entire interest, it held a 50% interest in the company Beh Total
along with Behran Oil (60%), a company controlled by entities with
ties to the government of Iran. Beh Total produced and marketed
in 2012 small quantities of lubricants (16,885 t) for sale to domestic
consumers in Iran. In 2012, revenue generated from Beh Total's
activities in lran was approximately €50 million, net income was
approximately €3 million and Beh Total paid approximately

€1 million in taxes and approximately €4 million of dividends for
fiscal year 2010 (share of TOTAL: approximately €2 million).

Total Marketing Middle East FZE (“TMME"), a wholly-owned affiliate
of TOTAL, sold in 2012 lubricants and additives to Beh Total in Iran.
In 2012, these activities generated gross revenue of approximately
€3.9 million and a net profit of approximately €0.8 million. TMME
stopped such sales at the end of 2012.

Total Oil Turkiye A.S. (“TOT A.S."), a company wholly-owned by
the Group and by two Group Employees, obtained in 2012, after
discussions with Beh Total, administrative authorizations from

the French authorities to export to Iran additives for blending by
Beh Total with base oils to produce lubricants for sale by Beh Total.
However, no transactions with or payments to Beh Total took place
in 2012 in relation to such proposed activity, and TOT A.S. does
not anticipate pursuing this business activity with Beh Total.

Total Ethiopia Ltd (“TEL”), an Ethiopian company wholly-owned by
the Group and by three Group employees, paid approximately
€70,000 in 2012 to Merific Iran Gas Co, an Ethiopian company
majority-owned by entities affiliated with the government of Iran,
pursuant to a contract for the transport and storage of LPG in
Ethiopia purchased by TEL from international markets. TEL will
continue such activity until it secures access to other local facilities,
which is expected in late 2013.

Total Raffinage Marketing S.A., a French company wholly-owned
by the Group and by five Group Employees, and Total Belgium NV,
a company held 99.99% by the Group and by an individual, provided
in 2012 fuel payment cards to Iranian diplomatic missions in France
and in Belgium, respectively, for use in the Group's service stations.
In 2012, these activities generated gross revenue of approximately
€50,000 and a net profit of approximately €2,000. The Group

has terminated these contractual agreements in France and is in
the process of terminating them in Belgium.

In addition, the Group holds a 50% interest in, but does not
operate, Samsung Total Petrochemicals Co. Ltd (“STC"), a South
Korean incorporated joint venture with Samsung General Chemicals
Co., Ltd. (60%). During the first six months of 2012 and prior to
Executive Order 13622, STC purchased 292,000 t of condensates
directly or indirectly from companies affiliated with the Iranian
government for approximately €264 million. As such condensates
are used by STC as inputs for its manufacturing processes,

it is not possible to estimate the revenues from sales or net income
attributable to such purchases. In reliance on the exemption
provided in Section 1245(d)(4)(D) of the National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA) announced on December 7, 2012, STC contracted to
recommence such purchases. However, STC’s management has
recently stated that STC would no longer take deliveries under such
contractual arrangement as from March 31, 2013. In addition STC
sold 1,450 t of polymers for approximately €1 million to two Korean


--- Page 83 ---

traders, Skyplast and Tera Korea, which may have subsequently
exported some or all of this product to Iran. Taking into account the
uses for such polymers (e.g., food packaging, pipes, car interiors),
the end-customers likely were private companies. STC may make
similar sales in the future.

Prior to January 23, 2012, Trading & Shipping ceased its purchase
of Iranian hydrocarbons. Before this date, Total International
Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TOTAL, purchased in Iran
during 2012 pursuant to a mix of spot and term contracts
approximately 2 million barrels of hydrocarbons from state-controlled
entities for approximately €189 million, which it subsequently resold
for approximately €176 million. As the Group hedges the risk
associated with a fluctuation in hydrocarbon prices during its
trading activities, the net income before tax attributable to such

3.10. Risks related to competition

TOTAL'’s competitors are comprised of national oil companies and
international oil companies. The evolutions of the energy sector
have opened the door to new competitors, increased market price
volatility and called the viability of long-term contracts into question.

TOTAL is subject to competition from other oil companies in the
acquisition of assets and licenses for the exploration and
production of oil and natural gas as well as for the sale of
manufactured products based on crude and refined oil. In the gas
sector, major producers are becoming interested in the
downstream value chain and are competing directly with
established distribution companies, including those that belong to
the Group. Increased competitive pressure could have a significant

activity was €3 million. Trading & Shipping owed to state controlled
entities in Iran approximately €235 million as of December 31,
2011 and €83 million as of December 31, 2012, which represented
the value of the hydrocarbons purchased prior to the cessation of
such activity.

Syria

Since early December 2011, TOTAL has ceased its activities that
contribute to oil and gas production in Syria and maintains a local
office solely for non-operational administrative functions. In 2012,
TOTAL made payments of less than €2 million to Syrian

negative effect on the sales prices, margins and market shares of
the Group's companies.

The pursuit of unconventional gas development, particularly in the
United States, has contributed to falling market prices and a
marked difference between spot and long-term contract prices.
The competitiveness of long-term contracts indexed to oil

prices could be affected if this discrepancy persists and if it should
prove difficult to invoke price revision clauses.

The major international oil companies in competition with TOTAL
are ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and BP. As of
December 31, 2012, TOTAL ranked fifth among these companies
in terms of market capitalization”.

The principal legal proceedings in which the Group’s companies are involved are described in Chapter 7 of this Registration Document.

4. Insurance and risk management

4.1. Organization

TOTAL has its own reinsurance company, Omnium Reinsurance
Company (ORC). ORC is integrated within the Group's insurance
management and is used as a centralized global operations tool for
covering the Group companies’ insurable risks. It allows the Group's
worldwide insurance program to be implemented in compliance
with the specific requirements of local regulations applicable in the
countries where the Group operates.

Some countries may require the purchase of insurance from a local
insurance company. If the local insurer accepts to cover the subsidiary
of the Group in compliance with its worldwide insurance program, ORC.
negotiates a retrocession of the covered risks from the local insurer.
As a result, ORC enters into reinsurance contracts with the subsidiaries’
local insurance companies, which transfer most of the risk to ORC.

At the same time, ORC negotiates a reinsurance program at the
Group level with oil industry mutual insurance companies and
commercial reinsurance markets. ORC allows the Group to better
manage price variations in the insurance market by taking on a
greater or lesser amount of risk corresponding to the price trends
in the insurance market.

In 2012, the net amount of risk retained by ORC after reinsurance
was a maximum of $90 million per third-party liability insurance
claim and $75 million per property damage and/or business
interruption insurance claim. Accordingly, in the event of any loss
giving rise to an aggregate insurance claim, the effect on ORC
would be limited to its maximum retention of $165 million per
occurrence.

Risk factors
Insurance and risk management

4.2. Risk and insurance management policy

In this context, the Group risk and insurance management policy is
to work with the relevant internal department of each subsidiary to:

- define scenarios of major disaster risks (estimated
maximum loss);

— assess the potential financial impact on the Group should a
catastrophic event occur;

4.3. Insurance policy

The Group has worldwide property insurance and third-party
liability coverage for all its subsidiaries. These programs are
contracted with first-class insurers (or reinsurers and oil and gas
industry mutual insurance companies through ORC).

The amounts insured depend on the financial risks defined in the
disaster scenarios and the coverage terms offered by the market
(available capacities and price conditions).

More specifically for:

— Third-party liability insurance: since the maximum financial risk
cannot be evaluated by a systematic approach, the amounts
insured are based on market conditions and oil and gas industry
practice. In 2012, the Group's third-party liability insurance for
any liability (including potential accidental environmental liabilities)
was capped at $850 million (onshore) and $750 million (offshore).

— Property damage and business interruption: the amounts insured
vary by sector and by site and are based on the estimated cost
of and scenarios of reconstruction under maximum loss scenarios
and on insurance market conditions. The Group subscribed
for business interruption coverage in 2012 for its main refining
and petrochemical sites.

For example, for the Group's highest risks (North Sea platforms
and main refineries and petrochemical plants), in 2012 the insurance
limit for the Group share of the installations was approximately

$1.7 billion for the Refining & Chemicals segment and approximately
$1.6 billion for the Upstream segment.

- help to implement measures to limit the probability that a
catastrophic event occurs and the financial consequences if
such event should occur; and

— manage the level of risk from such events to be either covered
internally by the Group or transferred to the insurance market.

Deductibles for property damage and third-party liability fluctuate
between €0.1 and €10 million depending on the level of risk and
liability, and are borne by the relevant subsidiaries. For business
interruption, coverage is triggered sixty days after the occurrence
giving rise to the interruption.

Other insurance contracts are bought by the Group in addition

to property damage and third-party liability coverage, mainly for car
fleets, credit insurance and employee benefits. These risks are
mostly underwritten by outside insurance companies.

The above-described policy is given as an example of a situation
as of a given date and cannot be considered as representative

of future conditions. The Group's insurance policy may be changed
at any time depending on the market conditions, specific
circumstances and on the General Management's assessment

of the risks incurred and the adequacy of their coverage.

TOTAL believes that its insurance coverage is in line with industry
practice and sufficient to cover normal risks in its operations. The
Group is however not insured against all potential risks. In the event
of a major environmental disaster, for example, TOTAL's liability may
exceed the maximum coverage provided by its third-party liability
insurance. The loss TOTAL could suffer in the event of such
disaster would depend on all the facts and circumstances of the
event and would be subject to a whole range of uncertainties,
including legal uncertainty as to the scope of liability for
consequential damages, which may include economic damage not
directly connected to the disaster. The Group cannot guarantee that
it will not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no guarantee,
particularly in the case of a major environmental disaster or
industrial accident, that such loss would not have a material adverse
effect on the Group.
