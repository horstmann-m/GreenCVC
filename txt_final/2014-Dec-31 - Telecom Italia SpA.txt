HIGHLIGHTS 2014

2014 was affected by recessionary pressures in the domestic market, where the signs of recovery are
still very weak, as well as the slowdown in the Latin American economies.

In this adverse economic environment, the Market continued to see an erosion of traditional services,
with a loss of value only partly offset by increased penetration and growth in innovative services.
Competition, however, showed signs of cooling during 2014, particularly in the domestic mobile
segment, easing pressure on prices and slowing the decline in average revenues per user. To defend its
customer base, Telecom Italia also continued to adopt a distinctive position in the market, through the
use of innovative convergent fixed-mobile deals, supported by new technology (Fiber and LTE) and
enhanced by new services and digital content. In this scenario, revenues, despite still being affected by
certain factors and regulatory aspects, started to stabilize with a steady recovery in performance
compared to the previous year.

In Brazil, economic growth was modest and the average exchange rate depreciated by over 8%
compared to 2013. In an environment of greater competition pressure, the mobile customers market
experienced a slowdown compared to the previous year, although this did not affect the growth of the
Brazilian investee.

You are reminded that, with effect from 2013, the Sofora - Telecom Argentina group has been classified
under Discontinued Operations.

More specifically, for the year 2014:

e Consolidated revenues amounted to 21.6 billion euros, down 7.8% on 2013 (-5.4% in organic
terms), while EBITDA fell to 8.8 billion euros, down 7.9% (-6.8% in organic terms).

The organic EBITDA margin stood at 40.7%, 0.6 percentage points lower than in 2013.

e Revenue performance for the Domestic Business Unit in the fourth quarter 2014 was -5.0%
compared to the same period of 2013 (-3.9% net of the negative impact of the retroactive revision of
prices for wholesale access services for the period 2010-2012), continuing the significant recovery
over the previous quarters (-5.0% third quarter, -8.2% second quarter, -8.3% first quarter) and the
full year 2013 (-9.5%).

e Operating profit (EBIT) amounted to 4.5 billion euros. In 2013, following the goodwill impairment loss
for Core Domestic of 2.2 billion euros, EBIT came to 2.7 billion euros. Excluding the impact of the
goodwill impairment loss, EBIT for 2013 would have been a positive 4.9 billion euros.

e — Profit for the year attributable to Owners of the Parent totaled approximately 1.4 billion euros, versus
a loss of 0.7 billion euros in 2013, due to the already mentioned goodwill impairment loss. Without
this impairment loss, the profit for the year 2014 would have been in line with the previous year.

e Adjusted net financial debt at December 31, 2014 came to 26,651 million euros, down 156 million
euros compared to December 31, 2013.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PERFORMANCE

Revenues

Revenues amounted to 21,573 million euros in 2014, down 7.8% from 23,407 million euros in 2013.
The decrease of 1,834 million euros was mainly attributable to the Domestic Business Unit (-1,085
million euros) and the Brazil Business Unit (-701 million euros). The latter was particularly affected by
weak exchange rates, which resulted in a depreciation of the Brazilian real against the euro of over 8%
compared to 2013 (in terms of average rates).

In terms of organic change, consolidated revenues fell by 5.4% (-1,230 million euros), and were
calculated as follows:

COMPARABLE REVENUES 21,573 22,803 (1,230) (6.4)

Exchange rate fluctuations(1) mainly related to the Brazil Business Unit (-566 million euros), while the
change in the scope of consolidation(2) was the result of the sales of La7 S.r.I. and the MTV group, both
in the Media Business Unit, which took place in April and September 2013 respectively. These were
offset by the entry into the scope of consolidation of Rete A, which is also part of the Media Business
Unit, over which control was acquired on June 30, 2014 and which was subsequently merged by
absorption into its controlling company Persidera S.p.A..

The breakdown of revenues by operating segment is as follows:

(*) Starting from 2014, the Domestic Business Unit also includes the Olivetti group, in addition to Core Domestic and International Wholesale. The comparative period has been
adjusted accordingly.

The Domestic Business Unit (divided into Core Domestic, International Wholesale and Olivetti) recorded
a decline in revenues for 2014 of 1,085 million euros (-6.6%), compared to 2013, but with a significant
recovery in the second half of the year (fourth quarter 2014: -5.0%, third quarter: -5.0%, second quarter:
-8.2%, first quarter: -8.3%), despite the continuing adverse macroeconomic environment and the
negative impact of the retroactive revision by the Regulatory Authority of the copper network wholesale
access prices for the period 2010-2012. Net of that impact, which resulted in the recognition in the final
quarter of 45 million euros in lower revenues from previous years, the performance for the fourth

(1) The average exchange rate used for the translation into euro of the Brazilian real (expressed in terms of units of local currency per 1 euro) was 3.12280 in 2014 and
2.86830 in 2013. The effect of the change in exchange rates is calculated by applying the foreign currency translation rates used for the current period to the period under
comparison.

(2) The change in the scope of consolidation has been calculated by excluding the contribution of the companies that have exited from the comparison figure and adding in the
estimated contribution of any companies entering the scope of consolidation.

quarter would have been -3.9%. This improvement in performance was mainly due to a cooling of
competition pressure - which resulted in the progressive stabilization of the customer base and ARPU
on traditional services - accompanied by a defense of market share, mainly on Mobile, and an
acceleration in the growth of broadband and ultrabroadband services.

In detail:

e — Revenues from services for the year 2014 amounted to 14,334 million euros, down 7.1% compared
to 2013. In particular, revenues from services in the Mobile business came to 4,608 million euros, a
decrease of 529 million euros compared to 2013 (-10.3%). Revenues from Fixed-line services
amounted to 10,672 million euros and were down 819 million euros compared to 2013 (-7.1%);

. Revenues from services in the fourth quarter of 2014 amounted to 3,619 million euros, down 4.4%
compared to the same period of the previous year (-3.2% net of the above-mentioned retroactive
revision of 2010-2012 wholesale access prices decided by AGCom), but with a recovery against the
three previous quarters (-6.2% in the third quarter, -8.9% in the second quarter, and -8.8% in the first
quarter);

e — Product sales, including change in work in progress, recorded revenues of 969 million euros for the
full year 2014, up on 2013 (+8 million euros), in both the Fixed-line and Mobile business.

For the Brazil Business Unit, organic revenues in 2014 were down 2.1% on the previous year. Revenues
from services fell by 2.3% compared to 2013, mainly due to lower revenues from incoming traffic as a
result of the reduction in the mobile termination rate. Handset revenues also declined (-1.5% compared
to 2013), mainly due to a reduction in sales volumes.

The total number of lines for the Brazil Business Unit at December 31, 2014 was 75.7 million, up 3.1%
compared with December 31, 2013.

A more detailed analysis of revenue performance by individual Business Unit is provided in the section
"Financial and Operating Highlights - The Business Units of the Telecom Italia Group".

EBITDA

EBITDA totaled 8,786 million euros (9,540 million euros in 2013), a decrease of 754 million euros
compared to 2013; the EBITDA margin was 40.7% (40.8% in 2013).

Organic EBITDA was down 643 million euros (-6.8%) compared to 2013; the organic EBITDA margin was
down 0.6 percentage points, from 41.3% in 2013 to 40.7% in 2014.

Organic EBITDA is calculated as follows:

Rete A.

(*) Starting from 2014, the Domestic Business Unit also includes the Olivetti group, in addition to Core Domestic and International Wholesale. The comparative period has been
adjusted accordingly.

EBITDA was particularly impacted by the change in the line items analyzed below:

e Acquisition of goods and services (9,430 million euros; 10,377 million euros in 2013).
The reduction of 947 million euros was mainly due to the Brazil Business Unit, for an amount of -670
million euros (including a negative exchange rate effect of 347 million euros), which also reflects the
reduction in prices for interconnection services, with a decline in revenues due to other TLC
operators. The Domestic Business Unit, on the other hand, reported a reduction of 223 million euros.
The decrease in acquisition of goods and services also offset the higher costs, resulting from
Telecom Italia's new market strategy, aimed at gradually ceasing to subsidize handsets in "bundle
deals". The new commercial strategy had an impact of 63 million euros of costs recognized in the
income statement for 2014. In 2013 the capitalized costs for subsidizing handsets (amortized over
the term of the contract with the customer, from 24 to 30 months) amounted to 188 million euros.
Further details are provided in the Note "Other intangible assets" of the Consolidated Financial
Statements at December 31, 2014 of the Telecom Italia Group.

e Employee benefits expenses (3,119 million euros; 3,087 million euros in 2013).
These increased by 32 million euros. The change was influenced by:

Telecom Italia Group Consolidated Operating Performance | 19
Report on Operations


--- Page 6 ---

— a2 million euros decrease in employee benefits expenses in Italy, due to lower expenses for
mobility pursuant to Law 223/91, totaling 11 million euros, almost entirely offset by an increase
in ordinary employee expenses and costs of 9 million euros.

In detail, the increase in ordinary employee expenses and costs was due to the net effect of the
following factors:
— the increase in the contractual minimums established in the TLC National Collective Labor
Agreement signed on February 1, 2013;
— the recognition of the notional costs relating to the Broad-Based Share Ownership Plan and
the Stock Option Plan;
— the reduction in the average workforce by 820 employees compared to 2013, of which an
average of 530 was a result of the application of the "Solidarity Contracts" by the Parent,
T.I. Information Technology, and by Olivetti S.p.A. (in 2013, the Parent and T.1. Information
Technology applied the solidarity contracts from the second quarter of 2013);
— the exit from the scope of consolidation of the companies La7 and MTV, with a reduction of
202 in the average headcount.
With regard to the expenses for mobility pursuant to Law 223/91, a total of 8 million euros was
recognized in 2014, of which 5 million euros for the agreement signed by the Parent with trade
unions on December 1, 2014 (under the framework agreement of March 27, 2013) and 3
million euros for the Olivetti S.p.A. mobility agreement signed with trade unions on March 1,
2014. In 2013, expenses of 19 million euros were recognized for the agreements with trade
unions signed by the Parent Telecom Italia S.p.A. and the company Advanced Caring Center.

— the increase of 34 million euros for the component outside Italy of employee benefits expenses.
The effects of the growth in the average workforce, which rose to an average of 780 employees,
and local salary variations, were partially offset by a negative exchange difference of around 28
million euros, essentially related to the Brazil Business Unit. In 2014, restructuring expenses of 4
million euros were also recognized in relation to a number of foreign companies of the Olivetti
group.

Other income (401 million euros; 324 million euros in 2013).

This item increased by 77 million euros compared to 2013.

The increase mainly related to the full release of the remaining risk provisions, for an amount of 84
million euros, already allocated in the 2009 consolidated financial statements, with respect to the
Telecom Italia Sparkle affair; the interest element (a further 2 million euros) had been released to
finance income. More details are provided in the Note "Contingent liabilities, other information" of
the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2014 of the Telecom Italia Group.

Other operating expenses (1,175 million euros; 1,318 million euros in 2013).

These fell by 143 million euros compared to 2013.

The decrease mainly related to the Domestic Business Unit (-101 million euros) and the Brazil

Business Unit (-34 million euros, including a negative exchange rate effect of 51 million euros).

They included:

— write-downs and expenses in connection with credit management (375 million euros; 380 million
euros in 2013) consisting of 295 million euros for the Domestic Business Unit (290 million euros
in 2013) and 80 million euros for the Brazil Business Unit (84 million euros in 2013);

— provision charges (84 million euros; 100 million euros in 2013) mainly consisting of 74 million
euros for the Brazil Business Unit (81 million euros in 2013) and 6 million euros for the Domestic
Business Unit (17 million euros in 2013);

— TLC operating fees and charges (449 million euros; 482 million euros in 2013) consisting of 399
million euros for the Brazil Business Unit (424 million euros in 2013) and 49 million euros for the
Domestic Business Unit (57 million euros in 2013);

— sundry expenses of 63 million euros; in 2013 they amounted to 134 million euros and mainly
related to the Domestic Business Unit for the estimate of the costs, of 84 million euros, for the
fine imposed by the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM) at the end of the A428 proceedings.

Depreciation and amortization
Details are as follows:

(millions of euros) 2014 2013 | Change
Amortization of intangible assets with a finite useful life 1,854 2,012 (158)
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment - owned and

leased 2,430 2,541 (111)
Total 4,284 4,553 (269)

The reduction in depreciation and amortization of 269 million euros was mainly attributable to the
Domestic Business Unit (-278 million euros), essentially due to a decrease in depreciable and
amortizable items.

Gains (losses) on disposals of non-current assets

In 2014, this item amounted to 29 million euros. A gain of approximately 38 million euros, on the sale by
Telecom Italia S.p.A. of a property located in Milan, for a price of 75 million euros, was offset by net
losses of 11 million euros, mainly relating to the disposal of tangible assets by the Domestic Business
Unit.

In 2013, this item showed a loss of 82 million euros, mainly relating to the realized loss, including
transaction costs, of 100 million euros from the sale of La7 S.r.l. to the Cairo Communication group on
April 30, 2013. This charge was offset by net capital gains on non-current assets totaling 18 million
euros, mainly relating to the sale of a property (around 17 million euros), and the sale of the entire
controlling interest (51%) held in MTV Italia S.r.l. (3 million euros).

Net impairment losses on non-current assets

These amounted to 1 million euros in 2014.

In preparing the 2014 Annual Report, the Group performed the goodwill impairment test. The results of
that testing, carried out in accordance with the specific procedure adopted by the Group, confirmed the
amount of the goodwill allocated to the Group's individual Cash Generating Units.

In 2013, this item amounted to 2,187 million euros and it is related to the impairment loss on goodwill
allocated to the Core Domestic Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) in the Domestic Business Unit.

Further details are provided in the Note "Goodwill" in the consolidated financial statements at December
31, 2014 of the Telecom Italia Group.

EBIT

EBIT amounted to 4,530 million euros in 2014. In 2013, EBIT came to 2,718 million euros and included
the impact of the above-mentioned impairment loss of 2,187 million euros on the goodwill allocated to
the Core Domestic CGU.

The organic change in EBIT was 1,843 million euros. Net of the above-mentioned goodwill impairment
loss the organic change compared to 2013 would have been negative by 344 million euros.

Organic EBIT was calculated as follows:

Foreign currency financial statements translation effect (70) 70

Changes in the scope of consolidation 39 (39)

COMPARABLE EBIT 4,530 2,687 1,843 68.6

Exchange rate fluctuations related entirely to the Brazil Business Unit, while the change in the scope of
consolidation was the result of the above-mentioned sales of La7 S.r.l. and the MTV group, as well as the
acquisition of Rete A.

Other income (expenses) from investments, net

This amounted to a positive 16 million euros, essentially referring to the remeasurement at fair value of
the 41.07% interest already held in Trentino NGN S.r.l., performed pursuant to IFRS 3, following the
acquisition of control of the company by Telecom Italia S.p.A. on February 28, 2014 at a price of 17
million euros.

Finance income (expenses), net

Finance income (expenses) shows net expenses of 2,194 million euros (net expenses of 2,183 million

euros in 2013), an increase of 11 million euros.

This increase was linked to the net effect resulting from the change in certain non-monetary items - of a

valuation and accounting nature, linked in particular to derivatives - which was offset by the reduction in

finance expenses related to the debt position.

In particular, the following is noted:

e an increase in the balance of finance expenses linked to the changes in the valuations of several
hedging derivatives, attributable to market fluctuations linked to currency translation. These are
unrealized valuation and accounting changes which do not result in any actual monetary settlement.
In 2013, a benefit was also recognized, of around 25 million euros, following the first-time adoption
of the new IFRS 13 "Fair Value Measurement", whereas for 2014 there was a negative impact of 72
million euros;

e the issuance at the end of 2013, by Telecom Italia Finance S.A., of the mandatory convertible bond
for an amount of 1.3 billion euros ("Guaranteed Subordinated Mandatory Convertible Bonds due
2016 convertible into ordinary shares of Telecom Italia S.p.A.") resulted in the accounting recognition
of the option embedded in the financial instrument separately from the related liability. In 2014, the
measurement of the option at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a negative impact on
adjustments to non-hedging derivatives of 174 million euros (in 2013 the impact was -124 million
euros).

Income tax expense

This item amounted to 928 million euros, down 183 million euros on 2013 (1,111 million euros), largely
due to the smaller taxable base of the Parent Telecom Italia. The Brazil Business Unit recorded a
decrease in tax expense of 16 million euros compared to 2013. This was due to the exchange rate effect
of approximately 18 million euros. Net of that effect, income tax expense would have been substantially
in line with the previous year, consistent with the trend in the taxable base expressed in local currency.

Profit (loss) from Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale

For 2014, the item Profit from Non-current assets held for sale amounted to 541 million euros (341

million euros in 2013) and related to:

e the positive contribution to the consolidation from the Sofora - Telecom Argentina group of 544
million euros (378 million euros in 2013);

e the costs related to disposals carried out in previous years and other items totaling 3 million euros
(37 million euros in 2013, of which 18 million euros relating to deferred taxes and sundry expenses
connected to the sale of the Sofora group and 19 million euros relating to disposals made in
previous years).

More details are provided in the section "Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale" of

Revenues

In an economic scenario that continues to show structural weakness, the change in 2014 compared to
2013 was a decrease of 6.6% (-1,085 million euros), with a decrease of 5.0% in the fourth quarter
compared to the same period of 2013 (-3.9% net of the negative impact of the retroactive revision by

the Authority of prices for wholesale access services for the period 2010-2012, which resulted in the
recognition in the final quarter of 45 million euros in lower revenues from previous years), representing
an improvement on the previous quarters of 2014 (-5.0% third quarter, -8.2% second quarter, -8.3% first
quarter) and on the entire year 2013 (-9.5%).

This trend in revenues was primarily due to the progressive stabilization in market share - mainly Mobile
- and growth in Fixed-line Broadband, ICT and Mobile Internet revenues.

In detail:

Core Domestic Revenues

e Consumer: revenues for the Consumer segment in 2014 amounted to 7,349 million euros, down
621 million euros compared to 2013 (-7.8%). This performance, although still negative, continues
the recovery seen in the second half of 2014. Compared to the same periods of 2013, the following
performance was recorded in 2014: in the fourth quarter -5.1%; in the third quarter -5.2%; in the
second quarter -9.2%; and in the first quarter -11.7%. In particular, revenues from Mobile services
fell by -398 million euros (-11.1%) compared to 2013 and -7.2% in the fourth quarter 2014 (against -
6.6% in the third quarter, -13.7% in the second quarter and -16.9% in the first quarter). This
reflected the positive impact from the structural improvement in competition performance, the
gradual stabilization of the customer base and ARPU, and the steady growth in mobile Internet.
Revenues from Fixed-line services also showed signs of recovery compared to the decline seen in
the first part of the year, with a reduction of -238 million euros (-5.9%) compared to the year 2013,
and -3.4% in the fourth quarter 2014 (-6.1% in the third quarter, -7.9% in the second quarter and -
6.2% in the first quarter), owing to stable market share and the positive performance of Broadband
ARPU, supported by the increased proportion of customers with flat contracts and service upgrades
(Fiber);

e Business: in 2014 revenues for the Business segment amounted to 4,824 million euros, down 387
million euros from 2013 (-7.4%), but an improvement on the previous periods, particularly for
revenues from services (4,436 million euros, -425 million euros compared to 2013, or -8.7%; -6.6%
in the fourth quarter of 2014, -7.9% in the third quarter, -10.6% in the second quarter and -9.8% in
the first quarter). In the Mobile business (-159 million euros in 2014 compared to 2013; -11.7%),
despite the effective defensive actions and growth of the customer base - which increased by 3.7%
- traditional voice and messaging services continued to decline (-183 million euros in 2014
compared to 2013), due to the repositioning of customers towards deals with lower overall ARPU.
The Fixed-line segment (-271 million euros in 2014 compared to 2013; -7.6%) continued to feel the
effects of the economic recession and the contraction in prices on traditional voice and data
services, although there were signs of recovery in the second half thanks in part to the steady growth
in ICT revenues (+3.5% over 2013, of which +22.0% for Cloud Services);

e National Wholesale: revenues for the Wholesale segment in 2014 amounted to 1,793 million euros,
decreasing 104 million euros compared to 2013 (-5.5%). The decline was mainly attributable to the
reduction in fixed-line and mobile termination rates, the already mentioned retroactive revision of
wholesale access prices by the Regulatory Authority for the period 2010-2012, the beginning of the
migration to IP infrastructure solutions, and the drop in prices for national roaming.

International Wholesale Revenues

International Wholesale revenues for 2014 amounted to 1,244 million euros, down 19 million euros
compared to 2013 (-1.5%). Revenues were down both for Voice services (-6 million euros, -0.6%) and for
IP/Data services (-8 million euros, -3.1%), as a result of growth in competition with a reduction in prices.
The Multinational Companies business segment also showed a slight decrease (-2 million euros, -3.1%),
whereas revenues for Mobile services were up slightly (+3 million euros, +12.2%).

Olivetti Revenues

Revenues for the Olivetti group in 2014 amounted to 227 million euros, down 38 million euros
compared to 2013 (-14.3%).

The reduction in revenues reflected the slowdown in sales outside Italy (-20 million euros), specifically
attributable to price competition for bank printers in the Chinese market, and the adverse economic
situation in the Italian market (-18 million euros).

EBITDA

EBITDA of the Domestic Business Unit in 2014 was 6,998 million euros, down 743 million euros
compared to 2013 (-9.6%, of which -2.2 percentage points resulting from the adoption of Telecom
Italia's new market strategy relating to costs for subsidies to customers for the purchase of handsets),
with an EBITDA margin of 45.7%, representing a slight deterioration compared to 2013 (-1.5 percentage
points, of which -1.1 percentage points related to the market strategy on costs for subsidies). The
decline was mainly due to the decrease in revenues from services (-1,093 million euros compared to
2013), only partially recovered through efficiency measures achieved through selective control and
containment of operating expenses.

With regard to the change in the main costs, the following is noted:

; 2014 2013 Change
(millions of euros)

Acquisition of goods and services 5,831 6,054 (223)
Employee benefits expenses 2,730 2,711 19
Other operating expenses 570 670 (200)

e Acquisition of goods and services decreased by 223 million euros (-3.7%) compared with 2013,
mainly attributable to efficiency measures on overheads - which resulted in an overall reduction in
general and administrative expenses, with specific regard to professional and consulting services -
and to commercial cost containment, due to the cooling of competitive pressure (specifically in the
Mobile business) and the resulting easing of the effort on marketing levers (lower distribution and
advertising costs);

e Employee benefits expenses increased by 19 million euros compared with 2013, mainly due to the
increase in ordinary employee expenses of 26 million euros, partially offset by the reduction in
restructuring expenses of 7 million euros. In particular:

— ordinary employee expenses and costs increased as a result of higher expenses due to the
increase in the contractual minimums established in the TLC National Collective Labor
Agreement signed on February 1, 2013, as well as the recognition of the notional costs relating
to the launch of the Broad-Based Share Ownership Plan and the Stock Option Plan (23 million
euros), which were offset by lower expenses deriving from the reduction in the average workforce
by 836 employees compared to 2013 (of which an average of 530 employees as a result of the
application of the "Solidarity Contracts" by the Parent, Telecom Italia Information Technology and
Olivetti S.p.A.; which the Parent and TI Information Technology have applied since the second
quarter 2013);

— a total of 12 million euros was recognized for restructuring expenses: 5 million euros for the
mobility agreement pursuant to Law 223/91 signed by the Parent with trade unions on
December 1, 2014 as an addition to the agreement of April 5, 2013; 3 million euros for the
mobility pursuant to Law 223/91 that Olivetti S.p.A. signed with trade unions on March 1, 2014;
and 4 million euros for the restructuring expenses relating to some foreign companies of the
Olivetti group. In 2013, expenses of 19 million euros were recognized for the agreements with

Telecom Italia Group Financial and Operating Highlights - The Business Units of the Telecom Italia Group | 29
Report on Operations Domestic Business Unit


--- Page 16 ---

trade unions signed by the Parent Telecom Italia S.p.A. and the company Advanced Caring
Center;

e Other operating expenses, totaling 570 million euros, fell by 100 million euros compared to the
previous year. In 2013, the item sundry expenses included an amount of 84 million euros recognized
as the estimate of the costs related to the fine imposed by the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM) at
the end of the A428 proceedings.

Details of other operating expenses are shown in the table below:

(millions of euros) 2014 2013 | Change
Write-downs and expenses in connection with credit management 295 290 5
Provision charges 6 (iC
TLC operating fees and charges 49 87 (8)
Indirect duties and taxes gol ~—<‘<‘éiOA~”~CS:*Y:~CO
Sundry expenses 121 202 (81)
Total 570 670 (100)

Other income amounted to 382 million euros in 2014 (299 million euros in 2013), an increase of 83
million euros, mainly attributable to the entire release of the remaining risk provisions already allocated
in the 2009 consolidated financial statements for the Telecom Italia Sparkle affair.

EBIT

EBIT for 2014 was 3,738 million euros (1,985 million euros in 2013), with an EBIT margin of 24.4%
(12.1% in 2013). This performance was due to - in addition to the absence of the goodwill impairment
loss for the Core Domestic Cash Generating Unit of 2,187 million euros, recognized in 2013 - by the
decrease in EBITDA described above, partially offset by the reduction in depreciation and amortization of
278 million euros and by the already mentioned gains of approximately 38 million euros on the sale by
Telecom Italia S.p.A. of a property located in Milan, for a price of 75 million euros.

Excluding the above-mentioned goodwill impairment loss from the EBIT for 2013, the change would
have been a decrease of 434 million euros (-10.4%).

Revenues

Revenues for 2014, amounting to 19,498 million reais, were down by 2.1% compared to 2013 (-423
million reais). Service revenues totaled 16,325 million reais, a decrease of 376 million reais compared
to 16,701 million reais for 2013 (-2.3%) mainly due lower revenues from incoming traffic as a result of
the reduction of the mobile termination rate. Revenues from product sales fell from 3,220 million reais
in 2013 to 3,173 million reais in 2014 (-1.5%); this decrease was attributable to a reduction in sales
volumes, which was only partially offset by an increase in prices.

Mobile Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) amounted to 17.7 reais for 2014 compared with 18.6 reais
for 2013 (-4.8%). The ARPU, as well as revenues from services, was affected by a further reduction, with
effect from February 2014, in the mobile termination rate.

The total number of lines at December 31, 2014 amounted to 75,721 thousand, 3.1% higher than on
December 31, 2013, representing a market share of approximately 27% in terms of lines.

EBITDA

EBITDA in 2014 amounted to 5,541 million reais, an improvement of 343 million reais on 2013
(+6.6%). The increase in EBITDA was essentially driven by lower costs for the acquisition of goods and
services, mainly attributable to lower revenues due to other TLC operators, despite higher employee
benefits expenses and a slight increase in other operating expenses. The EBITDA margin stood at
28.4%, 2.3 percentage points higher than in 2013.

acquisition of goods and services totaled 11,222 million reais (12,228 million reais in 2013). The
8.2% decrease compared to the previous year (-1,006 million reais) can be broken down as follows:
-1,209 million reais for revenues due to other TLC operators;
-72 million reais for purchases relating primarily to product cost;
+30 million reais for rent and lease costs;
+245 million reais for external service costs.

Employee benefits expenses, amounting to 1,183 million reais, were up 183 million reais compared
to 2013 (+18.3%). The average workforce grew from 10,657 employees in 2013 to 11,451
employees in 2014. The ratio of employee benefits expenses to total revenues rose to 6.1%, up 1
percentage point on 2013;

EBIT

EBIT amounted to 2,483 million reais, up 23 million reais on 2013. This increase was due to higher
EBITDA, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization charges of 313 million reais (3,049

million reais in 2014, compared to 2,736 million reais in 2013).

Agreement for the sale of telecommunications towers

On November 21, 2014, TIM and American Tower do Brasil entered into an agreement for the sale of a
maximum of 6,481 telecommunications towers, for a total price of approximately 3 billion reais, and a
Master Lease Agreement ("MLA") for portions of those towers, with an overall term of 20 years.
The sale will be divided into two contracts: the first relating to 5,232 towers and the second relating to
the remaining 1,249 towers, on which other operators hold pre-emptive rights. The agreement, which
shall be executed in the first half of 2015 in consecutive tranches, is subordinate to conditions including
authorization from the Brazilian Antitrust Authority (CADE).

MEDIA

Acquisition of control of Rete A S.p.A.

On June 30, 2014, Telecom Italia Media (Tl Media) and Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso (Espresso group)
completed the merger of the digital terrestrial network operator businesses controlled by Persidera
S.p.A. (new name of Telecom Italia Media Broadcasting S.r.|.) and Rete A S.p.A. (Rete A), respectively.
The merger was carried out through Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso's transfer of 100% of Rete A shares to
Persidera, as a subscription to a capital increase reserved to it. Following the transfer, Tl Media and
Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso hold 70% and 30%, respectively, of the shares in Persidera, which in turn
controlled Rete A's entire share capital.

The merger between TIMB and Rete A has created a combined entity that is the largest independent
network operator in Italy, with five digital multiplexes and nationwide high-coverage infrastructure, based
on next generation technologies.

The merger of Rete A by absorption into Persidera was completed on December 1, 2014.

The group resulting from the transaction is the primary supplier for the leading non-integrated national
and foreign television content providers operating on the Italian market.

Also in view of the uncertainty surrounding regulatory changes concerning the use of frequencies, TI
Media has retained a purchase option on user licenses (therefore excluding infrastructure and
customers) for one of the five frequencies that are owned by the combined entity.

The Telecom Italia Media Board of Directors, at the meeting of January 15, 2015, acknowledged the
developments in the Persidera valuation process and decided that the results of the process obtained to
date were not in line with expectations, and therefore, the sale of the investment held is not foreseeable
at this stage.

The table below shows the results of the Media Business Unit including, from June 30, 2014, the figures
for Rete A consolidated on a line-by-line basis.

In 2013, La7 S.r.|. and the MTV group were respectively sold in April and September, and consequently
exited the scope of consolidation.

(1) EBIT of the Media Business Unit for 2013 was driven down by 100 milion euros deriving from the loss realized on the sale of La7 S.r.. on April 30, 2013 and driven up by 3
milion euros from the gain realized on the sale of MTV Italia S.r. on September 12, 2013.

(2) Includes employees with temp work contracts (1 employee at December 31, 2014, zero at December 31, 2013), as well as personnel of Rete A, a company acquired at the
end of June 2014 (12 employees).

At December 31, 2014, the three Digital Multiplexes of Persidera S.p.A. (pre-merger) had reached a
population coverage of 95.6% of the Italian population.
In contrast, the coverage of the two Digital Multiplexes of the former Rete A was 93.4% and 93.7%.

To improve the comparability of the information, the figures for 2014 are shown below, compared
against the figures for 2013, which have been restated to exclude the results for the full year 2013 of
the two companies sold (La7 S.r.l. and MTV group).

Revenues

Revenues amounted to 71 million euros in 2014, a decrease of 1 million euro compared to 72 million
euros in 2013. The entry of Rete A into the scope of consolidation resulted in higher revenues of 9
million euros. Net of those revenues, the reduction in sales would have been 10 million euros and was
connected to the expiry, at the end of 2013, of the contract with RTI (Mediaset Extra and Italia 2) and
the termination, also at the end of 2013, of the contract with the channel QVC.

EBITDA

EBITDA was a positive 25 million euros in 2014, down 5 million euros compared to 2013 (30 million
euros). Net of the results of Rete A, the EBITDA of the Media Business Unit would have decreased by 7
million euros and was affected, in addition to the negative performance of Telecom Italia Media S.p.A.,
by the decline in the margin of the Network Operator (amounting to 32 million euros in 2014; 36 million
euros in 2013).

EBIT

EBIT was a positive 6 million euros (positive 2 million euros in 2013). This performance reflected the
change in EBITDA, described above, as well as the reduction in amortization and depreciation of 9
million euros, mainly attributable to the redefinition, during the annual review, of the useful lives of the
Network Operator frequencies - extended from December 31, 2028 to December 31, 2032, as a result
of the final allocation of the licenses for pursuit of television broadcasting activities - and the
transceivers, in line with their technological evolution. These revisions of the useful lives led to the
recognition of a total of around 11 million euros less amortization and depreciation.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS/NON-CURRENT
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

The results of the Sofora - Telecom Argentina group, which has been classified under "Discontinued
operations/Non-current assets held for sale" following the agreement for the sale to Fintech entered into
on November 13, 2013 and subsequently amended on October 24, 2014, are shown below.
Specifically, following those agreements:

e the first closing took place on October 29, 2014 and, as a result, 17% of the capital of Sofora was
sold. A consideration was received for this closing - also including other related assets - totaling

Revenues

Revenues for 2014 amounted to 33,341 million pesos, up 6,055 million pesos (+22.2%) compared to
2013 (27,286 million pesos), mainly thanks to the growth in the related average revenue per user
(ARPU) and the sale of handsets at a higher average price. The main source of revenues was mobile
telephony, which accounted for about 74% of the consolidated revenues of the Sofora - Telecom
Argentina group, an increase of 22% on 2013.

Fixed-line telephony service: the number of fixed lines decreased by 31 thousand compared to the end
of 2013 to a total of 4,093 thousand at December 31, 2014. Even though regulated fixed-line services
in Argentina continued to be influenced by the rate freeze imposed by the Emergency Economic Law of
January 2002, Average Revenue Billed per User (ARBU) rose by 9.3% compared to 2013, thanks to the
sale of additional services and the spread of traffic plans. Revenues from data and ICT services also
rose, because the prices of their contracts are set in US dollars and so they benefited from the
significant exchange rate difference in 2014.

Mobile telephony service: Telecom Personal mobile lines in Argentina decreased by 503 thousand
compared to the end of 2013, coming to a total of 19,585 thousand lines at December 31, 2014, of
which 32% were postpaid. At the same time, thanks to high-value customer acquisitions and leadership
in the smartphone segment, ARPU grew by 11.1% to 74.2 pesos (66.8 pesos in 2013). A large part of
this growth was attributable to value added services (including SMS messaging, revenue sharing and
Internet), which together accounted for 60% of revenues from mobile telephony services in 2014.

In Paraguay, the Nuicleo customer base grew by 2.5% compared to December 31, 2013, reaching 2,481
thousand lines, 19% of which are postpaid.

BroadBand: Telecom Argentina's portfolio of broadband lines totaled 1,771 thousand accesses at
December 31, 2014, an increase of 64 thousand on December 31, 2013. ARPU rose by 22.7% to 153
pesos (124.7 pesos in 2013), largely thanks to up-selling strategies and price adjustments.

EBITDA

EBITDA showed an increase of 1,130 million pesos (+15.0%) compared to 2013, reaching 8,673 million
pesos. The EBITDA margin stood at 26.0%, down 1.6 percentage points compared to 2013, mainly due
to higher employee benefits expenses and acquisitions of goods and services, also as a result of the
higher charges arising from the increase in purchases of goods for resale, as well as higher costs for
contracts entered into in foreign currency.

With regard to the change in the main costs, the following is noted:

(millions of euros) (millions of Argentine pesos)

2014 2013 2014 2013 Change

Other operating expenses 375 477 4,038 3,472 566
Change in inventories 6 (49) 64 (135) 199

e acquisition of goods and services totaled 14,963 million pesos (12,293 million pesos in 2013). The
increase of 21.7% compared to 2013 (+2,670 million pesos) was mainly due to higher external
service costs of 1,591 million pesos and greater purchases of goods of 895 million pesos;

e employee benefits expenses, amounting to 5,655 million pesos, increased by 1,477 million pesos
compared to 2013 (+35.4%). The change was due to salary increases resulting from periodic
revisions in union agreements, primarily linked to inflation, and to the increase in provisions for
termination benefit incentives. The percentage of employee benefits expenses to total revenues was
17.0%, up 1.7 percentage points over 2013;

e other operating expenses amounted to 4,038 million pesos, increasing 566 million pesos on 2013.
These expenses consist of the following:

Total 4,038 3,472 566
EBIT

EBIT for 2014 came to 8,657 million pesos compared to 3,774 million pesos recorded for 2013. The
increase of 4,883 million pesos was attributable to the improvement in EBITDA and the suspension of
calculation of depreciation and amortization following the Sofora - Telecom Argentina group's
classification under Discontinued operations, already for the Consolidated Financial Statements of the
Telecom Italia Group at December 31, 2013.

Telecom Italia Group Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale] 37
Report on Operations


--- Page 24 ---

Net impairment losses on non-current assets for the year 2014 mainly related to work in progress
initiated in previous years and now abandoned. In 2013, these amounted to 172 million pesos and
related to several business projects and IT platforms that the group had decided to abandon.

The EBIT margin stood at 13.8% of revenues (+12.2 percentage points compared to 2013).

Capital expenditures

Capital expenditures in 2014 amounted to 8,897 million pesos and increased by 3,986 million pesos
compared to 2013 (4,911 million pesos). This increase was essentially related to the award of a number
of mobile telephone frequencies to Telecom Personal for a total of 3,530 million pesos. See the section
“Auction for mobile telephony frequencies" for further details.

Capital expenditures were also aimed at customer acquisition costs, the enlargement and upgrading of
the access network to increase capacity and improve quality for the 3G mobile network, and the
upgrading of broadband services on the fixed-line network, in addition to backhauling to support the
growth in data traffic volumes.

Auction for mobile telephony frequencies

The auction procedures, announced by the Secretaria de Comunicaciones for the allocation of the
frequency bands to be used for the Servicio de Comunicaciones Personales ("PCS"), the Servicio de
Radiocomunicaciones Movil Celular ("SRMC") and the Servicio de Comunicaciones Moéviles Avanzadas
("SCMA") were carried out on October 31, 2014.

The competition was participated in by the four companies that had pre-qualified: Telecom Personal S.A.,
Telefonica Moviles Argentina S.A., Arlink S.A. and AMX Argentina S.A..

In this competition, Telecom Personal (Sofora - Telecom Argentina group) was awarded:
e Lot number 2 for the SRMC service,

e Lots number 5 and 6 for the PCS service,

e Lot number 8 for the SCMA service.

Telecom Personal offered a total amount of 658 million USD to acquire these frequency lots.

On November 27, 2014, with the publication on the Boletin Oficial (Official Gazette), the lots were
Officially allocated to Telecom Personal, with the sole exception of Lot 8, which was only partially
allocated.

The price was set accordingly at 411 million USD and paid on December 17, 2014.

Telecom Personal has formally requested the completion of the allocation of Lot 8, which will entail the
payment of an additional 247 million USD and is an essential condition for compliance with the terms
and conditions of the Auction, including with regard to the significant targets in terms of quality of
service.

MAIN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS OF THE
BUSINESS UNITS OF THE GROUP

DOMESTIC

Consumer

In 2014, Telecom Italia pursued the development of its Consumer Fixed-Line business by accelerating
the spread of fiber optics, increasing new activations, and protecting its voice and broadband customer
base. In terms of the spread of fiber, the network development plan continued, driving an increase from
37 municipalities covered in December 2013 to 110 municipalities at the end of December 2014.

To support new acquisitions, during the year there were a number of promotions on the "introductory
price" for fiber offerings (e.g. InternetFibra at 29 euros per month rising to 44.90 euros or
Tuttofibra/Tuttofibra Plus at 39 euros per month for the first six months, rising to 54.90 euros), which
are made even more attractive for limited periods (e.g. TUTTOFIBRA at 29 euros for the first 6 months
rising to 44.90 euros thereafter). We also ran other local promotions during 2014 (such as including a
tablet for 1 euro with 30-month lock-ins in some cities).

The increase in new activations was attributable mainly to the TUTTO offer, launched in the latter
months of 2013, which combines unlimited ADSL with a phone line offering unlimited calls to all
domestic fixed and mobile numbers, at the highly attractive price of 29 euros per month for the first 12
months.

The drive for new activations intensified from March 2014 onwards, with the launch of TIM Smart, the
first "convergent" offer that combines a Telecom Italia fixed line and TIM mobile. TIM SMART covers the
entire family's communication needs, both at home and on the move, thanks to extensive fixed and
mobile broadband coverage and a varied range of SIMs and options (e.g. additional SIMs for
smartphones and tablets, unlimited fixed-line calls, generous bundles of extra mobile minutes), all at
attractive prices billed in a single monthly statement.

The launch of TIM Smart helped to protect the customer base by combining fixed and mobile services to
meet the needs of the entire family at an economical price. In addition, it helped to limit fixed-line
terminations. To reinforce this initiative, there was a continued marketing effort to maximize penetration
of unlimited calls deals through the launch in April of the TUTTO VOCE package, which includes unlimited
calls to all domestic fixed and mobile numbers, with installation and line rental included at 29 euros per
month, forever.

Starting in November, we cut the prices of the Basic Line and the home Phone Line subscription (GTN
Line) by eliminating call set-up charges, while slightly raising home phone line subscriptions and per-
minute traffic rates. The change - which affected customers with a home phone line subscription and
those with a basic phone tariff - is designed to ensure transparency by eliminating call set-up charges
and to provide a stimulus for migration to new "all-inclusive" offers.

In November we also introduced the New Charter of Telecom Italia Services, which implements the
resolutions of the National Regulatory Authority for Communications (AGCom) and applies to all
customers. Telecom Italia's aim through this initiative is to pursue continuous improvement in its quality
standards, with a view to simplifying, strengthening and ensuring transparency in customer
relationships.

In the Consumer Mobile market, we followed a segmented approach and sales strategy designed to
maximize the value of the fixed and mobile customer base, reserving unique benefits for converging
customers (e.g. "If you have Telecom Italia at home, you get unlimited calls to TIM phones").

For the Mass Market and Young segments, after a 2013 characterized by a major increase in
competition that led to a severe fall in the price of mobile services, Telecom Italia led the market
towards a more rational price structure, setting its products and services apart through distinguishing
factors such as LTE, content bundling (e.g. Sport, Entertainment, YouTube) and new purchasing
methods.

This enabled the us to pursue a "value" strategy, allowing us to maintain the entry level TIM Special deal
at 19 euros per month. The initiatives included enhancing the TIM Young package by enabling Facebook

and Twitter browsing without using any data allowance, as well as music streaming that also does not
use up data, which has always been included. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we focused on expanding
the potential target market for the deal by introducing new web-based purchasing methods. We also
sought to drive purchases of new LTE-enabled smartphones in the Christmas period by offering 50 euros
free phone credit and disposal of the old phone. The aim of this was to increase new technology
penetration and upselling of deals with data included, through a targeted initiative that was also
designed to reinforce Telecom Italia's commitment to protecting the environment.

In the Premium segment, the policy of curtailing subsidies continued in line with 2013 and extra benefits
were concentrated into the highest value packages.

In Mobile Broadband services, there was a continued acceleration in 4G-LTE Internet services. As of
September, ultra broadband services are already available in more than 3,000 Italian municipalities,
achieving an outdoor coverage of more than 77% of the national population and the leading network
performance. TIM's technology leadership was confirmed by the launch of LTE Advanced 4G Plus
services, which provide connection speeds of up to 225 Mbps. It is also worth underlining that thanks to
the high performance of TIM's ultra broadband network, the content offered through TIM Vision became
an integral part of TIM's 4G offering, enabling customers to select between TIMVision entertainment and
sport at no extra cost.

Business

Telecom Italia's business sector strategy in 2014 had two aspects: driving convergence, innovation and
IT in support of its core business; and simplifying its offer and internal processes to improve delivery.
The main objective pursued during the year was to reinforce the positioning of Telecom Italia as a
leading national player in terms of responding to the ICT needs of small, medium and large companies,
and of the Public Administration. This was executed by leveraging its high-profile nationwide presence
and promoting cloud services in order to drive increasing use of its core connectivity offering, speeding
up the spread of fixed-line fiber services and the adoption of LTE on the mobile network thanks to
significant increases in both of their coverage during the course of the year, thereby boosting the
technological evolution of web access, which is the key to the delivery of next-generation services.

In the Fixed-line business, Telecom Italia has strengthened its commercial offering to various market
segments, with the restructuring of the TUTTO deal, which offers customers a complete flat voice-data
solution that always includes unlimited broadband, fixed-fixed and fixed-mobile traffic. This initiative
contributes to the ongoing consolidation of the focus on fiber (next-generation networks), which has
been further complemented by the expansion of service coverage and developments in IT systems that
enable the targeting of larger customer segments (e.g. customers currently using outdated solutions
such as ISDN).

For high-level business customers, in terms of voice services a plan is in place to drive the innovative
Nuvola IT Comunicazione Integrata offer, which is based on VoIP and Unified Communication platforms,
offering the customer significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency of operating costs, better
collaboration in the business community, mobility and a move towards fixed-mobile integration.
Regarding our range of Information Technology products and services, we are continuing to extend our
portfolio of Cloud Services, building an offering based on increasingly modular basic services that are
easy to configure and activate online independently. In particular, in terms of the range of Cloud services
for Small and Medium Business customers, in 2014 we invested in the creation of the NuvolaStore
Marketplace, to offer a broad portfolio of services that can be purchased online through an 'Over-The-
Top' system. Convergence with higher-value fixed and mobile core broadband services, promoted
through spending credits for the market place, was the key factor in accelerating the penetration of "as a
service" IT offerings among SMEs. Despite the continuing downturn in the IT sector, the performance of
Telecom Italia in the business market improved in 2014, driven mainly by Cloud services, in which it
retained its overall leadership - especially in Private and Hybrid Cloud services.

In terms of Mobile services, the Business market in 2014 was also conditioned by further development
of the Ultra BroadBand Mobile service based on the LTE network. Marketing policies focused on
implementing a more rational, efficient and targeted pricing structure across all segments, while also
expanding our offering with VAS and IT solutions.

Prices largely held firm over the year, accompanied by stable sales volumes. In the modular TIM TUTTO
range of services, having previously had LTE as an optional extra for all additional data options - at an

appropriate premium price - from the start of the fourth quarter the increased usage of broadband data
services justified the inclusion of 4G on all phone and data bundles.

For customers in the direct sales channel, we have also started an extensive review of our marketing
approach, which is mainly designed to protect the customer base and is built around new product and
service models already tested in other segments such as: ending handset subsidies, pushing pre-paid
and standard packages, and initiatives to support the growing Bring Your Own Device trend. In 2014, we
also won the contract for the major Consip Mobile 6 convention for around 900,000 users in the central
and local Public Administration - further confirmation of Telecom Italia's ability to maintain its
leadership role and key-partner status for major customers, by winning conventions and contracts in
highly complex and competitive scenarios.

Lastly, 2014 saw the start of operations at the subsidiary TIDS - Telecom Italia Digital Solutions, whose
main role is to cover important and innovative adjacent markets, such as OTT cloud services and the
Internet Of Things, which have grown significantly, enabling TIDS to post double-digit revenue growth in
2014.

BRAZIL

In order to offer a more comprehensive pre-paid range, TIM Brasil launched the following deals in 2014:

e in the second quarter: "Infinity Web 100", which enables connection to high-speed Internet for
tablets and PCs through an Internet stick, "Infinity Turbo 7" and "Ricarica Express", making it possible
to top up your own phone or someone else's via Facebook using a credit card previously registered
on the site "Recarga Express";

ein the third quarter: "TIM Day voice", valid for local and long-distance calls, which for 0.75 reais per
day includes up to 300 minutes to another TIM user, while the Infinity tariff plan applies above that
threshold.

In addition, in light of growing mobile Internet demand, we have launched the first post-paid plan based

around WhatsApp, which does not include a voice component but instead, for a price of 29.90 reais per

month, offers unlimited use of WhatsApp, 300 MB of data and unlimited SMS messages to all operators,
as well as 10 reais of credit for extra services.

TIM has also stepped up development of innovative products, in order to increase data traffic use,

launching the following initiatives:

e from August, following the partnership with Wizard - one of the Brazil's best-known chains of
language schools - a new service for English language learning, offering three levels with
differentiated services at a weekly price of between 1.99 reais and 3.99 reais;

e new plans for "Machine to Machine" (M2M) devices, offering capacities of 20MB to 2.5GB and 3G
and 4G services, to respond to demand for greater bandwidth and speed. To develop this kind of
service, Anatel has established that these SIMs are subject to reduced FISTEL tax;

e from October, a new deal for connecting up to four devices using a single data package, without any
costs for the additional chips, and data bundles of 6 GB, 10GB, 20GB and 50GB.

In terms of broadband, TIM has started to market "Live TIM Extreme", a fixed-line ultra broadband plan

that offers speeds of 1GB - the fastest available in Brazil - thanks to FTTH technology, at the cost of

1,499.90 reais/month, and "Live TIM Blue Box", a device that integrates free-to-air HD channels, Netflix

and YouTube, which offers leading multimedia video content and uses an integrated system called "Blue

Box do Seu Jeito" that tracks user preferences.

There are two more initiatives to note from 2014:

e the signature of an important strategic cooperation agreement with ZTE Corporation to speed up
technological innovation in the development of ultra broadband in Brazil, also involving the
construction of an R&D center;

e the launch of a new fixed-line ultra broadband plan, offering download speeds of 70 Mbps and
upload speeds of 30 Mbps. The plan costs 119.90 reais per month and includes a free Wi-Fi
modem.

Regarding handset sales, during 2014 TIM expanded its range first with the Samsung Galaxy S5,

followed by the second-generation Motorola Moto X and Moto G, and the LG G3 (priced between 729

reais and 1,499 reais). Also, TIM began to sell the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the fourth quarter,

promoting it together with a Liberty plan offering progressive discounts (in line with the amount of free
minutes), thereby retaining its leadership as a handset seller in Brazil.

MAIN CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK

DOMESTIC

Wholesale fixed markets

Telecom Italia Reference Offers for the year 2013

After having completed the approval of the 2013 technical and economic conditions for LLU and

bitstream services (Resolutions 746/13/CONS and 747/13/CONS) of December 19, 2013, on

September 1, 2014 the National Regulatory Authority for Communications (AGCom) published the

resolutions on its website approving the Reference Offers for the year 2013 for the following wholesale

services on Telecom Italia's fixed network:

e Wholesale Line Rental (Resolution 67/14/CIR);

e NGAN access - local installation infrastructures, ducts along the access network, primary and
secondary fiber optics, terminating segments in fiber optics (Resolution 68/14/CIR);

e NGA bitstream, the VULA service and related accessory services (Resolution 69/14/CIR);

e specific capacity transmission services - terminating circuits, interconnection flows and exchange
connections - (Resolution 70/14/CIR).

On September 1, 2014, the public consultation was also initiated, through Resolution No. 71/14/CIR,

for the approval of the Telecom Italia Reference Offer for the year 2013 for call origination, termination

and transit services over the fixed public telephone network with TDM interconnection and VoIP/IP.

Lastly, on December 23, 2014 the resolution establishing the economic conditions for the year 2013 for

the end-to-end service was published (Resolution 128/14/CIR).

On December 23, 2014 and January 7, 2015, the resolutions were published for the launch of the

public consultations for the approval of 2014 prices for wholesale disaggregated access services, for co-

leasing services and for the WLR service. The consultations only involve the 2014 prices for the one-off

contributions for these services, while the determination of the monthly rentals, based on the BU-LRIC

model, has been deferred to the market analysis initiated by the Authority with Resolution

390/12/CONS dated September 4, 2012.

Lastly, on February 27, 2015, the resolution was published for the launch of the public consultation for

the approval of the 2014 prices for specific capacity transmission services (terminating circuits,

interconnection flows and exchange connections).

Wholesale access services

With regard to the results of the public consultation launched on September 4, 2012 (Resolution
390/12/CONS), the proceedings are still under way for the 3rd cycle of analysis of the (retail and
wholesale) copper and fiber fixed-line access market for the three-year period 2014-2016, as the
Authority has repeatedly deferred their conclusion.

Specifically, on February 13, 2015, the Authority launched a new public consultation on wholesale
access prices for the period 2014-2017. The final decision has to be notified to the European
Commission, which has the power to express an opinion on it within thirty days from notification.

In detail, the Authority announced two different regulatory scenarios: a) "Alpha Scenario", where the
market is national, single and uniform; and b) "Beta Scenario" where competition conditions in some
areas of the country will be different than in other areas, which will result in regulatory obligations and
prices being differentiated between "competition areas" and "non-competition areas". The competition
status of an area is determined according to whether there is a concentration of investments in NGA
networks by at least two operators (B Areas), compared to areas where these conditions do not apply (A
Areas). The distinction between the two types of areas depends on whether a set coverage threshold is
reached by at least two ultra broadband networks.

(*) Intermediate value based on the level of infrastructures. The Authority has asked for opinions on the calculation methods in the consultation.

On October 9, 2014, the Commission approved the new recommendation on relevant markets,
immediately removing the Retail Access Market (one of the three markets analyzed in the above
procedure, which was in fact removed from the Analysis in the text of the Consultation) and the
Origination Market.

In November 2014, the Consiglio di Stato partially upheld an appeal submitted by an operator regarding
the approval of the Telecom Italia reference offer for bitstream services in 2009. The Consiglio di Stato
upheld the petition concerning the methods of calculating the monthly rentals for the service -
established by the Authority (Resolution 71/09/CONS) based on the retail minus principle - which had
noted the lack of additional verification of the correctness and fairness of the quantification of the
"minus" component. The Consiglio di Stato has asked the Authority to re-examine the size of the minus
component and to that end a public consultation was launched on March 5, 2015 in which AGCom, after
investigating the matter further, proposed a draft measure that confirms the minus value in force in
2009 (20% less than the retail rental fee). The public consultation will last for 30 days.

Lastly, with regard to the proceedings initiated by AGCom in June 2014, the Authority issued a press
release on February 25, 2015 - in compliance with another ruling of the Consiglio di Stato concerning
copper network wholesale access rates for the three-year period 2010-2012 - announcing the final
approval of the decision on the amendment to LLU rates for the period 2010-2012. Specifically, the
following changes have been made for the monthly LLU rentals: for 2012, from 9.28 euros per month to
9.05 euros per month; for 2011, from 9.02 euros per month to 8.90 euros per month; and for 2010,
from 8.70 euros per month to 8.65 euros per month. The proceedings were also intended to update the
WLR and bitstream rates for the same period; however, the Authority postponed this decision to a later
time, as it intends to wait for the final ruling on the execution of the Consiglio di Stato decision on the
bitstream service for 2009.

Telecom Italia reflected the effects of the new rates for the period 2010-2012 in the income statement
figures for the fourth quarter 2014, with a total impact, in terms of lower revenues, of 45 million euros.

New Generation Networks

With regard to measures relating to other operators' access to Telecom Italia street cabinets, on April 9,
2014 the Authority published a decision setting out the conditions on obligations for locating and giving
access to the cabinets (Resolution 155/14/CONS). In particular, Telecom Italia is required to announce
the installation of new cabinets (or upgrades to existing cabinets) on a quarterly basis, to enable
competing operators to participate in the planning process (this notification procedure came into full
effect from the start of 2015). In addition, in order to install their own mini-DSLAMs, competing
operators will be able to ask for Telecom Italia's existing cabinets to be expanded through extensions or

Report on Operations


--- Page 31 ---

the construction by Telecom Italia of new cabinets next to the existing ones. In the latter case, ownership
of the cabinets will lie with the other licensed operators that request their construction and they will be
responsible for their maintenance and related costs. Lastly, in view of the difficulties in determining the
technical and construction specifications for installing the additional extensions, the Authority has
postponed all decisions until a technical feasibility study to identify the correct conditions for their supply
has been conducted.

High-quality wholesale access from fixed workstations

On November 17, 2014, the public consultation was launched (Resolution 559/14/CONS) on the 3rd
cycle of market analyses of high-quality wholesale access from fixed workstations (market no. 4, 2014
Recommendation, formerly the market relating to terminal segments of leased lines). Telecom Italia
provided its contribution within the deadline set by AGCom (January 16, 2015) and is awaiting the
conclusion of the proceedings.

Retail fixed markets

Effective from July 1, 2014, the prices for traffic for Business customers subscribing to the Telecom

Italia Basic Offer have changed. For the main traffic routes (local, national and fixed-to-mobile) a single

price of 10 euro cents (excluding VAT) is applied for the call set-up charge and 10 euro cents (excluding

VAT) for each minute of conversation.

Effective from November 1, 2014, the rental prices for GTN (General Telephone Network) lines and

prices for traffic for Consumer customers subscribing to the Telecom Italia Basic Offer have changed.

The amendment consists of the following changes:

e the monthly rental for GTN lines has increased from 17.54 euro per month (including VAT) to 18.54
euro per month (including VAT). There are no changes in the monthly rental prices for ISDN lines and
line rental prices for customers in the special Social Groups and holders of the Social Card issued by
the Government;

e for direct calls to the main traffic routes (local, national and fixed-to-mobile) the call set-up charge
has been eliminated and a single price of 10 euro cents (including VAT) has been applied for each
minute of conversation.

Online copyright protection

On March 31, 2014, the new Regulation on Online Copyright Protection (Resolution 680/13/CONS)
came into force. At the end of a specific inquiry process, AGCom can order Telecom Italia to selectively
remove content (where it operates as a Hosting Provider), or to block access to sites (where it operates
as a ‘mere conduit’), or to remove contents of its catalog (in the case of provision of on-demand media
services).

Sports rights

On April 9, 2014, both AGCom and the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM), in separate decisions,
approved the Guidelines on the Offering of Rights to the Serie A Soccer League, 2015-2018. Both
documents call for Serie A's offering to be conducted under fair, transparent and non-discriminatory
conditions, in order to ensure open competition to all operators of all distribution platforms.

Universal Service

In the first half of 2014, the verification of the net cost for 2007 was initiated and concluded. In the
implementing resolution (Resolution 100/14/CIR) AGCom determined that, also in 2007, the provision

Telecom Italia Group Main changes in the regulatory framework | 45
Report on Operations


--- Page 32 ---

of the mandatory universal service did not result in a net cost and therefore the mechanism for dividing
the cost cannot be applied. Telecom Italia has appealed against this resolution before the TAR. In the
meantime, Telecom Italia has also submitted its assessments of the net cost for 2008 and 2009 to the
Authority. The auditor appointed by the Authority has concluded its work and we are awaiting AGCom's
proposal.

On September 4, 2014, AGCom initiated an investigation to identify the criteria for designating one or
more operators engaged to provide the Universal Service in electronic communications pursuant to
Article 58 of the Electronic Communications Code. Currently the only operator designated to provide the
Universal Service is Telecom Italia. During the public consultation Telecom Italia reiterated that the
significant competition, and the economic and technological developments in the TLC sector to date,
justify the elimination of the Universal Service obligations, as there are numerous offers on the domestic
market that are comparable and equivalent to the offers marketed by Telecom Italia in terms of
availability, quality and accessibility of price.

On January 23, 2015 the Administrative Court (TAR) of Lazio published two rulings that rejected
Vodafone's appeal and upheld Telecom Italia's appeal against Resolution 1/08/CONS, through which
the Authority, during 2008, had introduced a new calculation method for calculating the net cost for
Universal Service. This new calculation method was retroactively applied, starting from the 2004 net
cost, which resulted in a significant reduction in the scope of costs attributable to the Universal Service.
Telecom Italia specifically objected to the possibility of retroactively applying any administrative order
and, in this case, the new criteria introduced to calculate the net cost, which reduced its value to zero.

Wholesale mobile markets
Mobile termination rates on H3G network

On February 14, 2014, the Consiglio di Stato accepted the appeal by H3G regarding the determination
of mobile termination rates from July 1, 2012, as set out in AGCom Resolution 621/11/CONS. This
Resolution established, among other things, that from July 1, 2013 onward there must be complete
symmetry between H3G termination rates and rates for other mobile operators, thus bringing the
deadline originally set in the framework decision subject to public consultation
(Resolution 254/11/CONS) forward by six months. The Consiglio di Stato ordered the cancellation of this
change in timing, effectively restoring tariff asymmetry in favor of H3G. In a decision of May 28, 2014, in
compliance with this ruling, the Authority not only restored tariff asymmetry for the second half of 2013,
but also revised the termination price upwards for the H3G network for the first half of 2013.

Resolution 621/11/CONS (canceled) Resolution 259/14/CONS (new prices)
(eurocents/minute)
July 2012 | January2013 | July 2013 July 2012 | January 2013 | July 2013
H3G 35 17 0.98 35 2.06 134
Telecom Italia 25 15 0.98 25 15 0.98
Vodafone 25 15 0.98 25 15 0.98
Wind 25 15 0.98 25 15 0.98

On October 16, 2014, the Authority published Resolution 365/14/CONS, approved on July 17, 2014,
which revised the termination rates on H3G for the period November 1, 2008-June 30, 2009, following
the ruling by the Consiglio di Stato published in February 2013.

The procedure ended with the amendment of the termination rate on the H3G network for the period
November and December 2008 (extending the validity of the amount of 16.26 cents per minute, which
was originally effective until October 2008) and leaving the amount of 13 cents per minute unchanged
for the period January-June 2009.

On February 9, 2015, the Authority published the public consultation for the 4th cycle of analysis of the
mobile termination market, which was initiated on February 11, 2014.

The Authority's measure proposal establishes that all operators offering voice termination services on
their own mobile network have significant market power. Accordingly, a draft measure has been
submitted to public consultation that sets out the same regulatory obligations (such as, for example,
access to and use of network resources, control of prices, and accounting for costs), both for mobile
network operators and full MVNO operators. In addition, for the years 2014-2017, the Authority has
proposed a glide path for mobile network termination rates, which is symmetric for all notified operators,
as detailed in the table below:

Voice termination rates on mobile network 2014-2017

(eurocents/minute)
From 1/1/2014 From 1/1/2015 From 1/1/2016 From 1/1/2017

0.98 0.96 0.94 0.92

The duration of the public consultation is 45 days.

In the same consultation, the Authority also announced the need to initiate specific monitoring to
analyze the financial and technical conditions of supply of wholesale access services by mobile network
operators to virtual mobile operators, in order to assess the significance of competition restrictions on
the mobile network access market.

AGCom contribution fee

On March 5, 2014, the Administrative Court (TAR) of Lazio published its ruling, fully upholding the
pronouncement of the EU Court of Justice, which had been asked to issue a preliminary ruling on the
matter. It accepted Telecom Italia's appeal concerning the cancellation of the resolutions through which
AGCom had requested payment of 26.6 million euros for amounts the Authority considered unpaid for
2006-2010 and the amount due for the contribution fee for 2011 (24.2 million euros).

The ruling of the Lazio TAR also affirmed the principle whereby the contribution fees of operators of
electronic communications networks and services should only cover costs relating to activities
unequivocally used for ex-ante regulation of this sector and that revenues connected to ex-ante
regulation and obtained as administration fees from the companies must not exceed the overall costs
directly pertaining to this regulatory activity. AGCom lodged an appealed against the Lazio TAR ruling and
requested a suspension, which, however, was rejected. On November 27, 2014, the hearing was held
before the Consiglio di Stato on the appeal lodged by AGCom against the rulings of the Lazio TAR and, on
February 17, 2015, the final ruling was published, which accepted the petitions made by Telecom Italia
and rejected the appeal by AGCom, upholding the previous ruling by the Lazio TAR. This resulted in the
annulment of the resolution containing the request for Telecom Italia to pay 26.6 million euros as an
adjustment for the insufficient payment in the five-year period 2006-2010 for the contribution to the
functioning of the Authority.

On March 14, 2014, the AGCom resolution was published setting the guidelines for the payment of the
2014 fees (Resolution 547/13/CONS) which, not only does not implement the main aspects of the
aforementioned Lazio TAR ruling - even though the appeals are pending with the Consiglio di Stato -
but also expands the tax base (revenues recorded under the item A1 "Revenues from sales and
services" of the income statements published in the 2012 financial statements) despite reducing the
contribution rate to 0.14%. On April 30, 2014, Telecom Italia paid an amount, via reverse charge and
with reservations, of 14 million euros calculated according to the parameters deriving from the Lazio
TAR ruling, applying the AGCom rate for 2014 of 0.14%, and appealed Resolution 547/13/CONS before
the Lazio TAR.

In line with the requirements of the TAR and EU regulations, on November 21, 2014 the Authority
published its first report on 2013 ("2013 Annual Report") which reveals that the expenses incurred for

Telecom Italia Group Main changes in the regulatory framework | 47
Report on Operations


--- Page 34 ---

activities attributable to the electronic communications sector, amount to approximately 40 million
euros (56% of total expenses incurred by the Authority) and that the Authority "collected" approximately
4.5 million euros more in 2013 from operators in the electronic communications sector.

On March 5, 2015, the AGCom resolution containing the guidelines for the payment of the 2015
contribution fee were published (Resolution 567/14/CONS). The Authority confirmed the revenues
recorded under the item Ai "Revenues from sales and services" of the income statements published in
the 2013 financial statements as the tax base and set a contribution rate of 0.115%. The contribution
rate for the electronic communications market, for the year 2015, is different from the rate applied to
the remaining markets covered by the Authority (e.g. the media and publishing markets), set at 0.2%.
The payment deadlines have also been further brought forward to April 1, 2015.

BRAZIL

Anatel

On June 18, 2014, the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) approved the new Mobile
Termination Rates (MTR), Fixed Termination Rates (FTR) and Leased Line rates (EILD) for the years
2016-2019. These rates, calculated using the Bottom-Up Long Run Incremental Cost model, establish
reductions ranging from 24% to 45% in the first year (2016), from 40% to 48% in the second, third, and
final year (2017-2019), to reach 0.017 reais in 2019. The FTRs will undergo reductions of around 63%
to 73% in the first year, from 21% to 50% in the second and third year, and from 18% to 50% in the final
year, depending on the area concerned, reaching 0.005 reais in 2019. With the publication of the Glide
Path and until the adoption of the LRIC model in 2019, all Significant Market Power (SMP) operators will
have a single MTR for each of Anatel's 3 macro areas of Brazil. Regarding leased circuits, the benchmark
values set in the cost model will only be used by Anatel in the event of conflict between operators, and
the LRIC model will be used only starting from 2020.

General Regulation on the Rights of Consumers of Telecommunication Services (RGC)

On March 10, 2014, Anatel published Resolution 632/2014 - General Regulation on the Rights of
Consumers of Telecommunication Services (RGC) - designed to standardize consumer protection and
improve the rights of users of telecommunication services. Due to the complexity of the requirements,
operators have between 120 days and 24 months from the Regulation's publication date to implement
its provisions. The three main requirements are: (i) from July 8, 2014, if a call with an operator is
interrupted, the provider must immediately re-establish contact by calling the customer; (ii) automatic
cancellation: consumers must be able to terminate their service contract without assistance, over the
phone (from July 8, 2014) and online (from March 10, 2015); and (iii) voice and data packages from
October 10, 2015: consumers must be warned when their usage is approaching the limit of the amount
of minutes/data included in their tariff.

"Marco Civil da Internet"

The core Brazilian legislation on Internet services (the "Marco Civil da Internet") came into force on
June 23, 2014, even though the rules on some of its key aspects are still under discussion. The draft law
was approved by the Senate on April 22, 2014, after years of debate, and converted into law by
President Dilma Rousseff the next day, coinciding with the Net Mundial forum hosted by Brazil in Sao
Paulo. One of the fundamental aspects still to be clarified is the concept of net neutrality and exceptions
to this, in addition to the conditions and duration for which service providers must keep user access
logs. While awaiting the regulations implementing the law, it has been decided that operators cannot
offer free access to certain types of content.

Auction for the allocation of 4G licenses

On September 30, 2014, Anatel terminated the auction for the allocation of the user licenses for the
700 MHz band, for the development of the 4G mobile network, based on LTE technology, assigning the
subsidiary TIM Celular the license for Lot 2 for a term of 15 years, which can be renewed for an
additional 15 years for an end price of 1,947 million reais. The cost of the investment for TIM includes
an additional 904 million reais as compensation for the clean-up cost of the band covered by the
license. Also, as one of the lots offered in the auction was not allocated, TIM had to take on additional
clean-up costs of 295 million reais, offset by a discount of 208 million reais on the price of the license
(which was consequently reduced to 1,739 million reais).

Against payment of 1,678 million reais, TIM Celular signed the "Termo de Autorizacao" license
assignment contract on December 5, 2014.

The clean-up operations - which should be concluded by the end of 2019, based on the forecasts of the
Ministry of Communications - will be conducted by a legal entity, called AED, to be established by March
2015, in which an ownership interest will be held by all the parties awarded the license.

MEDIA

Digital frequencies

AGCom adopted Decision 181/09/CONS, enacted in article 45 of Law 88/2009, setting the criteria for
the LLU digital switchover of terrestrial television networks. On the basis of this measure, the Ministry for
Economic Development (MISE) allocated licenses to the digital frequencies. The measure was necessary
due to the infringement proceeding 2005/5086 brought by the European Commission against Italy,
which found that problems in the Italian television sector and the monopolization of frequencies by RAI
and Mediaset needed to be redressed. The infringement proceeding is still pending.

Following the switch-off process, which lasted four years and was concluded on July 4, 2012, the
Ministry for Economic Development definitively assigned the digital frequencies.

Specifically, on June 28, 2012, the decision was taken to definitively assign the user rights of digital
frequencies for 20 years.

On July 18, 2013, AGCom adopted Resolution 451/13/CONS on the National Digital Frequency
Assignment Plan. The new plan involves 22 national networks and reserves channels 57-60 UHF for
mobile services, effective immediately. The amendment of the PNAFD also involved a review of the
allocations made and the resolution of interference problems and international coordination issues,
including replacing channel 60 UHF (which suffers interference from the mobile services on the adjacent
band) - allocated to Persidera - with channel 55 UHF.

The substitution is due to be completed by June 30, 2015.

In terms of the steps taken to address the findings of the EU Commission, in 2010 AGCom - via
Resolution 497/10/CONS - arranged a ‘beauty contest' for the assignment of the user rights to digital
dividend frequencies. However, the contest was canceled on April 28, 2012 with the entry into force of
Law 44/12 and replaced with a competitive tender under new rules set out by AGCom in
Resolution 277/13/CONS (adopted on April 11, 2013) for three lots of frequencies (L1, L2 and L3).

The only party that participated in that tender - which was carried out in June 2014 and which Persidera
(then TIMB) was unable to participate in, because it was incorrectly equated to RAI and Mediaset - was
the Cairo group, which was awarded the MUX L3 for 31,626,000 euros.

The allocation of the two remaining frequencies (Lot L1 and L2) not yet awarded has still not been
formally decided.

Also under the infringement procedure, AGCom completed the analysis of the conditions and methods of
use of the transmission capacity for the broadcasting of audiovisual content, which was aimed at
evaluating the possible introduction of must carry obligations for network operators that hold five MUXs.
The analysis showed that, at present, there do not appear to be any problem issues that justify the
imposition of must carry obligations at national level.

Contribution fee for user rights

On September 30, 2014, following a public consultation, AGCom published Resolution 494/14/CONS

setting the criteria for determining the contribution fees for user rights of television frequencies. In

particular, it established:

e The value of Lot L3 of the digital dividend auction (awarded to the Cairo Group), discounted at a rate
equal to the rate for 15-year 2013 BTPs, as the benchmark value.

e An increase of 5% for the second, 10% for the third, 15% for the fourth, and 20% for the fifth MUX,
as an anti-monopoly measure.

e A discount of up to 30% for the DVB-T2 MUX up to 2018.

e Adiscount of at least 70% for local operators.

e A glide path not exceeding 8 years for non-integrated operators (such as Persidera), halved for
integrated operators (such as RAI and Mediaset). During the glide path stage, the anti-monopoly
measure mentioned above will only apply to Rai and Mediaset.

Considering that these contribution fees are additional to the administrative fees and user fees for the

backbone network frequencies (Article 34, Article 35 and Attachment 10 of Italian Legislative Decree

259/03), AGCom has suggested that the Ministry for Economic Development conduct a full review of

these specific fess to take account of the particular characteristics of terrestrial television networks.

Telecom Italia Group Main changes in the regulatory framework | 50
Report on Operations


--- Page 37 ---

Persidera, also supported by a legal opinion, has appealed against this resolution as it proposes criteria

that would result in values that are unreasonable, discriminatory and out of proportion (approximately

15% in additional expenses on the total market value). The EU Commission has also expressed a similar

opinion. In a letter dated July 18, 2014, sent to AGCom and the Ministry for Economic Development, the

Commission made several observations on the measure still under consultation, as part of the

infringement proceedings no. 2005/5086 concerning television frequencies.

The letter contains a crucial passage in which the Commission reiterates the importance of setting

contributions that take account of the characteristics of the Italian television broadcasting market, as it

is affected by several factors, including "the advantages that incumbent operators have benefited from
the transition to the digital system, as well as subsequently, and in particular, as acknowledged by the

Italian authorities in their 2009 proposal, the advantages of incumbent integrated vertical operators that

have a significant number of multiplexes".

Persidera deems that the value of the contributions should not deviate from the international

benchmark and the comparison with the mobile market:

e the UK Authority has set the contribution fee for national MUX user rights at approximately 230,000
euros per year, reserving the right to amend these values after 2020;

e a similar value would be obtained based on the values of user fee contributions for mobile
frequencies pursuant to the Electronic Communications Code, adjusted proportionately to the
reference market.

The Ministry for Economic Development has issued a decree (published in the Official Gazette on

January 19, 2015) establishing that, by January 31, 2015, as an advance for the year 2014, network

operators must pay 40% of the amount paid in 2013.

This advance serves to provide income flows to the Government budget, pending the establishment of

the contribution fee regime to be applied to network operators and service providers, in consideration of

the impossibility of matching progressive rates with equal revenue levels, envisaged by Law 44/12, or
with the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination, established by the EU regulations.

Potential use of frequencies for mobile technology

Once the global conference on the regulation of the radio spectrum - to be held in Geneva in late 2015
(WRC-15) - has been concluded, 700 MHz band frequencies (between 694-790 MHz, corresponding to
television channels 49-60 UHF) currently allocated to broadcasting, will be able to be allocated on a co-
primary basis to broadband mobile services.

Ahead of this deadline, it is likely that the EU authorities will reorganize the frequency spectrum to
enable the development of mobile broadband services, with a consequent reduction in the resources
allocated to digital terrestrial television.

The reallocation process, which will presumably take place between 2016 and 2018, will most likely
mirror the process implemented the "first" digital dividend for 800 MHz bandwidth, involving the re-
farming to other available frequencies or the return of the frequencies in exchange for monetary
compensation.

There is a remote possibility that, if the right regulatory and technical conditions arise at the right
moment, television operators could use these frequencies to provide mobile broadband services.

In this regard, the agreement between TI Media and Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso sets out the
procedures through which TI Media will be able to acquire the user rights for channel 55 UHF allocated
to the MUX TIMB2.

In particular, Tl Media has reserved itself two different purchase options, one alternative to the other,
involving: (i) the purchase of the right to use the UHF CH 55 or (ii) the acquisition of the entire share
capital of TIMB2 S.r.I., a newly formed company, which, after completion of related approval process, will
be awarded this right of use.

Both options may be exercised during the period from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2019.

If right to use the CH 55 is transferred, a rental agreement will be signed between the two companies
whose execution is subject to authorization in accordance with current regulations.

On September 1, 2014 Pascal Lamy as Chairman of the High Level Group on UHF, formed in January
2014 and consisting of representatives of broadcasters, mobile operators and manufacturers,
presented the report on the future use of the UHF spectrum to the European Commission.

Telecom Italia Group Main changes in the regulatory framework | 54.
Report on Operations


--- Page 38 ---

The report proposes a "2020-2030-2025" time frame for meeting the objectives of the European Digital

Agenda, providing broadcasters a stable route to invest and grow in the medium to long term, structured

as follows:

e allocation of the 700 MHz band to mobile broadband services in 2020, with a margin of more or less
2 years (2018-2022) to take account of different market situations in the Member States;

e allocation of the bandwidth under 700 MHz (470-694 MHz) to broadcast services across Europe
until 2030;

e re-evaluation of the scenario in 2025 with an assessment of the state of the market and technology.

This report will serve as an input to the new European Commission, in establishing the spectrum policy,

also in view of the ITU-R World Conference 2015 (WRC-15), the outcome of which could lead to more

specific and stricter measures being adopted for the Member States.

COMPETITION

DOMESTIC
The market

In the second half of 2014, the Italian TLC market showed signs of easing of the strong competition
pressure, involving the significant use of pricing as a lever (which was particularly intensive during 2013)
that has led over the years to an impoverishment of the traditional service components, particularly the
voice service.
Growth in Broadband - particularly Mobile, also aided by the penetration of next-generation handsets -
continues to be the main driver of the market.
The growth in broadband has also led to an evolution towards increasing complexity in the competitive
scenario, with more inter-relationships between players of different markets. This has opened the field
to competition from non-traditional operators (in particular Over the Top companies - OTTs - and
producers of electronic and consumer devices), in addition to giving telecommunications operators the
opportunity to develop new "over the network" services (mainly in the IT and Media fields).
For the telecommunications operators, the core competition with the other traditional operators in the
sector (including Mobile Virtual Operators), which today still represents the factor that has the greatest
impact on market trends, is now being accompanied by an invasion by OTTs and device producers,
which are exploiting their complete understanding of consumer trends, consumer electronics and
software environments and which operate entirely in the digital world, based on competition strategies
that are completely different to those of TLC players.

Over time, therefore, the traditional players' business models are changing to meet the challenges from

the new entrants and to exploit new opportunities:

e in Media, broadcasters, who are vertically integrated players, continue to dominate the scene;
however, with the Web becoming increasingly important as a complementary distribution platform,
they are increasingly under pressure from consumer electronics companies, telecommunications
operators and OTTS;

e in the Information Technology market, the decline in revenues is driving the various players towards
the cloud computing "growth oasis", with the goal of developing and protecting their market shares in
their core business. Telecommunications operators are expected to strengthen in this sector,
including through partnerships;

e in the Consumer Electronics market, producers can develop services that can be used through the
Internet, building on handset ownership and management of the user experience, breaking the
relationship between customers and TLC operators and competing with the media and OTTs, thanks
to games consoles and set-top boxes, for the role of net enabler through the living room screen;

e OTTs have, for some time now, been leading the transformation of the methods of use of TLC
services (including voice), increasingly integrating them with Media and IT.

With regard to the current positioning of the telecommunications operators in converging markets, on

the other hand, the following is taking place with different levels of progress:

e development of Innovative Services in the IT market, particularly in Cloud services;

e development of new Digital Services, especially in the areas of Entertainment (e.g. TV over IP), Smart
Home, Digital Advertising, Mobile Payment-Digital Identity.

Competition in Fixed Telecommunications

The fixed-line telecommunications market continues to see a significant decline in voice revenues due to
the reduction in rates and the progressive shift of voice traffic to mobile. In recent years all the operators
have attempted to at least partially counter this phenomenon by concentrating mainly on the ability to
innovate their offering by developing the penetration of Broadband and introducing bundled voice,
broadband and services deals (double play), in a highly competitive environment with consequent
pricing pressure.

The evolution of the competitive product offering has also been influenced by consolidation, among
competitors, of an approach based on the control of infrastructure (above all Local Loop Unbundling -

LLU). The main fixed operators are now also offering mobile services, also as Mobile Virtual Operators
(MVOs).

In 2014, the migration of customers from fixed-line to mobile telephony services continued, as well as
the migration to alternative communications solutions (Voice Over IP, messaging, e-mail and social
network chat). For years, both for private consumers and small and medium businesses, mature
traditional voice services have been replaced by value-added content and services based on the Internet
protocol. This shift has been facilitated by the use of the Internet and changes in user preferences, by
the spread of broadband, personal computers and other connected devices, and by the quality of the
service.

The competitive scenario in the Italian fixed telecommunications market is characterized by the
presence, in addition to Telecom Italia, of a number of operators such as Wind-Infostrada, Fastweb,
Vodafone-TeleTu, BT Italia and Tiscali, that have different business models focused on different
segments of the market.

At December 31, 2014, fixed accesses in Italy totaled approximately 20.6 million (including
infrastructured OLOs and Fixed Wireless Access), down from 2013. The growing competition in the
access market has led to a gradual reduction in Telecom Italia's market share.

In the broadband market, at December 31, 2014 fixed broadband customers in Italy reached a
penetration rate on fixed accesses of about 69%.

The spread of broadband is driven not only by the penetration of personal computers and other enabled
devices (e.g. Smart TVs), but also by the growing demand for speed and access to new IP based services
(Voice over IP, Content - particularly Video, social networking services, etc.).

The decline continued in revenues from the data transmission segment, which suffered the effects of
competition that has led to reduction in average prices.

Competition in Mobile Telecommunications

The mobile market, which is saturated and mature in its traditional component of voice services, has
experienced a decline in the number of lines, due to the rationalization of second and third SIM cards (at
December 31, 2014, mobile lines in Italy numbered about 94 million, down by about 3% over 2013,
which still represents a very high penetration rate of the population, of approximately 157%).

Revenues from traditional service components, such as voice and messaging, continued to decline, as
these components are impacted by the strong competition between TLC operators based on pricing as a
lever - which was particularly intense in 2013 but with signs of a slowdown in the second half of 2014 -
in addition to the increasing spread of "communication apps". Mobile Broadband continues to grow and,
although it is unable to offset the drop in revenues from traditional services, it represents the main
strategic and business opportunity for the mobile TLC industry, also due to the launch of LTE Ultra
Broadband.

In 2014, the growth in mobile broadband customers continued, both large and small screen, with a high
penetration rate on mobile lines, especially as a result of the increasing spread of smartphones and
tablets.

Alongside innovative services that have already caught on and are under full-scale development, as in
the case of mobile apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of
mobile broadband, with major potential for growth in the medium term, such as machine to machine
and mobile payment.

The competitive scenario in the Italian mobile telecommunications market is dominated by
Telecom Italia and also by the infrastructured operators (Vodafone, Wind, H3G) which are focused on
different segments of the market or have different strategies.

In addition to these operators, the field also includes mobile virtual operators (MVO), of which
PosteMobile is the most important player. These operators currently have a limited share of the market,
but continue to enjoy significant growth compared to infrastructured operators.

BRAZIL

At the end of 2014, the Brazilian mobile market reached 280.7 million lines. This is 3.6% more than last
year and a penetration of 138.0% of the population (136.4% in 2013). Net total increases for 2014
amounted to 9.6 million lines, 0.3 million more lines than for the prior year.

Adjusted net financial debt at December 31, 2014 stood at 26,651 million euros, down 156 million

euros compared to December 31, 2013 (26,807 million euros).

Excluding the net financial assets of the Sofora - Telecom Argentina group, amounting to 122 million
euros (630 million euros at December 31, 2013), the net financial debt would have decreased by 664

million euros compared to December 31, 2013.

The table below summarizes the main transactions that had an impact on the change in adjusted net

financial debt during 2014:

In addition to what has already been described with reference to EBITDA, net financial debt during 2014
was particularly impacted by the following items:

Capital expenditures on an accrual basis

The breakdown of capital expenditures by operating segment is as follows:

(millions of euros) 2014 2013 | Change
% of total % of total
Domestic (*) 2,783 55.8 3,034 68.9 (248)

% of Revenues 23.1 18.8 4.3 pp

(*) Starting from 2014, the Domestic Business Unit also includes the Olivetti group, in addition to Core Domestic and International Wholesale. The comparative period has been
adjusted accordingly

Capital expenditures in 2014 totaled 4,984 million euros, an increase of 584 million euros compared to

2013. In particular:

e the Domestic Business Unit reported capital expenditure down by 248 million euros compared to
2013. This reduction was entirely attributable to the more traditional components of capex, and
involved the abandonment of several platforms and the simplification of various industrial
processes. A portion of these savings was targeted to the development of next generation networks
(LTE and fiber networks, +156 million euros in capital expenditure compared to 2013), which
reached 36% of network capex (28% in 2013). In addition, as already noted, in 2014, as a result of
Telecom Italia's new market strategy of offering bundle deals for mobile telephony, the costs relating
to subsidies to customers for the purchase of handsets are no longer recognized under capital
expenditures on intangible assets. In 2013, 188 million euros was capitalized over the contractual
period (24 - 30 months);

e the Brazil Business Unit recorded an increase in capex of 846 million euros compared to 2013, due
to a negative exchange rate effect of 110 million euros, without which the increase would have been
956 million euros. The increase was essentially attributable to the allocation at the end of 2014 of
the user rights for the 700MHz frequency for the development of the fourth-generation network on
LTE technology, and the related incidental costs, as well as the costs for cleaning up the frequencies
(freeing up of the spectrum licensed) totaling 936 million euros.

Change in net operating working capital

The change in net operating working capital for 2014 was a decrease of 464 million euros (decrease of

230 million euros in 2013). In particular:

e the change in inventories had a positive impact of 55 million euros, whereas the management of
trade receivables generated a negative impact of 125 million euros mainly connected to the changes
in the volumes of sales to factoring companies;

e other changes in operating receivables/payables (-466 million euros) also included the payment by
Telecom Italia S.p.A. of the fines and related interest imposed by AGCM of around 105 million euros
in relation to the A428 Antitrust Proceedings, as well as higher net receivables of the Brazil Business
Unit due from the local financial authorities for indirect taxes amounting to 100 million euros;

e the change in operating provisions includes the effect of the full release of the remaining provisions,
made in the 2009 consolidated financial statements for the Telecom Italia Sparkle affair, for a total
of 84 million euros.

With reference to the capital increase reserved for employees of the Group, under the Broad-Based
Share Ownership Plan concluded in July 2014, it should be noted that the items "Change in provisions
for employee benefits" and "Share capital increases/(reimbursements, including incidental costs)" do
not include the employee severance indemnity advances, amounting to 40 million euros, paid to
employees of the companies of the Telecom Italia Group to allow them to subscribe to the Plan.

Sale of investments and other disposals flow

Sale of investments and other disposals flow for the year 2014 totaled 238 million euros and was

mainly attributable to:

e the receipt of 71 million euros, already net of the 4 million euros pledged as security, from the sale
by Telecom Italia S.p.A. of a property located in Milan;

e the receipt of 160 million euros from the sale to Fintech of the 17% non-controlling interest in
Sofora; the amount does not include the other assets transferred at the same time as the shares, for
an amount of around 10 million euros.

In 2013, this item was positive and totaled for 62 million euros and was mainly attributable to:

e the proceeds from the sale by Tierra Argentea (a company wholly owned by the Telecom Italia Group)
to Fintech of Class B ordinary shares of Telecom Argentina S.A. and Class B preferred shares of
Nortel Inversora S.A., for a total of 79 million euros;

e the proceeds from the sale of the MTV group to Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN), of 11
million euros;

e the installment proceeds from the sale of the investment in EtecSA Cuba, which took place at the
end of January 2011, of approximately 48 million euros;

e the net requirement of approximately 110 million euros generated by the sale of La7 S.r.|. to Cairo
Communication;

e the proceeds from the sale of other tangible and intangible non-current assets of approximately 40
million euros.

Financial investments flow

This item amounted to 32 million euros and mainly consisted of:

e Qmillion euros for the acquisition of control by Telecom Italia S.p.A. over the company Trentino NGN
S.r.l. on February 28, 2014, as the difference between the price paid (17 million euros) and the net
cash acquired (8 million euros);

e 21 million euros, for the acquisition, on June 30, 2014, of the controlling interest in Rete A S.p.A.
now merged into Persidera S.p.A. (Media Business Unit). The transaction took place in the form of a
contribution of the shares of Rete A as a subscription of a reserved capital increase and so the
amount of the investment is represented by the net financial debt acquired.

Finance expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating
requirements flow

Finance expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating requirements flow mainly consist of the
payment, during 2014, of net finance expenses (1,684 million euros) and income taxes (427 million
euros), as well as the change in non-operating receivables and payables. The income taxes flow includes
the effect from the sale without recourse of IRES tax credits to a factoring company, which generated net
proceeds of 231 million euros.

The financial risk management policies of the Telecom Italia Group are aimed at diversifying market
risks, fully hedging exchange rate risk, and optimizing interest rate exposure through appropriate
diversification of the portfolio, which is also achieved by using carefully selected derivative financial
instruments. Such instruments, it should be stressed, are not used for speculative purposes and all have

an underlying, which is hedged.

In addition, to determine its exposure to interest rates, the Group sets an optimum composition for the
fixed-rate and variable-rate debt structure and uses derivative financial instruments to achieve that
composition. Taking into account the Group's operating activities, the optimum mix of medium/long-term
non-current financial liabilities has been established, on the basis of the nominal amount, at a range of

65% - 75% for the fixed-rate component and 25% -

35% for the variable-rate component.

In managing market risks, the Group has adopted Guidelines for the "Management and control of
financial risk" and mainly uses IRS and CCIRS derivative financial instruments.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, from 2009, in addition
to the usual indicator (renamed "Net financial debt carrying amount"), a measure called "Adjusted net
financial debt" has also been shown, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial
markets. Given that some components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for
setting the exchange and interest rate for contractual flows) and derivatives embedded in other financial
instruments do not result in actual monetary settlement, the "Adjusted net financial debt" excludes
these purely accounting and non-monetary effects (including the effects resulting from the introduction
of IFRS 13 from January 1, 2013) from the measurement of derivatives and related financial
assets/liabilities.

Sales of receivables to factoring companies

Sales of trade receivables to factoring companies completed during 2014 resulted in a positive effect on
net financial debt at December 31, 2014 of 1,316 million euros (1,434 million euros at December 31,
2013). On August 4, 2014, Telecom Italia S.p.A. sold IRES tax receivables without recourse for 303
million euros. The sale of these receivables, which had arisen in 2012 pursuant to Decree Law 16/2012
and were recognized in the 2012 financial statements at December, generated net proceeds and a
positive impact on financial debt of 231 million euros.

Gross financial debt

Bonds

Bonds at December 31, 2014 totaled 26,085 million euros (26,027 million euros at December 31,
2013). Their nominal repayment amount was 24,914 million euros, up 29 million euros compared to
December 31, 2013 (24,885 million euros).

the Group, at December 31, 2014, the figure was 196 million euros (nominal amount) and decreased by
2 million euros compared to December 31, 2013 (198 million euros).

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan
The following table shows the composition and the draw down of the committed credit lines available at
December 31, 2014:

On August 1, 2014, i.e. the date of expiry of the 8 billion euro committed Revolving Credit Facility, the
amount drawn down of 1.5 billion euros was repaid.

On the same date, the two RCFs became available for drawdown by a total of 7 billion euros. On May 24,
2012 and on March 25, 2013, Telecom Italia S.p.A. had extended the Revolving Credit Facility
amounting to 8 billion euros and expiring in August 2014 ("2014 RCF") by 4 and 3 billion euros
respectively, through two Forward Start Facilities that would come into force at the end of the 2014 RCF.
Telecom Italia also has a bilateral term loan expiring August 3, 2016, for 100 million euros from Banca
Regionale Europea, drawn down for the full amount.

On October 20, 2014, a bilateral term loan was signed with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti for an amount of
150 million euros with a 5-year expiry, drawn down for the full amount.

On November 10, 2014, a bilateral term loan was signed with Mediobanca for an amount of 200 million
euros with a 5-year expiry, drawn down for the full amount.

Maturities of financial liabilities and average cost of debt

The average maturity of non-current financial liabilities (including the current portion of medium/long-
term financial liabilities due within 12 months) is 7.10 years.

The average cost of the Group's debt, considered as the cost for the year calculated on an annual basis
and resulting from the ratio of debt-related expenses to average exposure, is about 5.4%.

For details of the maturities of financial liabilities in terms of expected nominal repayment amounts, as
contractually agreed, see the Notes "Financial liabilities (non-current and current)" in the consolidated
financial statements at December 31, 2014 of the Telecom Italia Group.

Current financial assets and liquidity margin

The Telecom Italia Group's available liquidity margin amounted to 13,112 million euros at December
31, 2014 (net of 135 million euros related to Discontinued Operations), corresponding to the sum of
"Cash and cash equivalents" and "Current securities other than investments", totaling 6,112 million
euros (7,092 million euros at December 31, 2013), and the committed credit lines, mentioned above, of
which a total of 7,000 million euros has not been drawn down. This margin is sufficient to cover Group
Financial Liabilities due beyond the next 24 months. The reduction in "Cash and cash equivalents"
compared to December 31, 2013 reflected the trend in repayments/new issues, as well as the use of
liquidity to repurchase Group bonds.

In particular:

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to 4,812 million euros (5,744 million euros at December 31,

2013). The different technical forms of investing available cash at December 31, 2014 can be analyzed

as follows:

— Maturities: investments have a maximum maturity of three months;

— Counterparty risk: investments by the European companies are made with leading banking, financial
and industrial institutions with high credit quality. Investments by the companies in South America
are made with leading local counterparties;

— Country risk: deposits have been made mainly in major European financial markets.

Current securities other than investments amounted to 1,300 million euros (1,348 million euros at

December 31, 2013). These forms of investment represent alternatives to the investment of liquidity

with the aim of improving returns. They consist of 254 million euros of Italian treasury bonds purchased

by Telecom Italia S.p.A. and 656 million euros of Italian and European treasury bonds purchased by

Telecom Italia Finance S.A.; 5 million euros of Italian Treasury Certificates (CCTs) (assigned to Telecom

Italia S.p.A. as the holder of trade receivables, as per Italian Ministry of the Economy and Finance

Decree of December 3, 2012); and 385 million euros of bonds purchased by Telecom Italia Finance S.A.

with different maturities, all with an active market and consequently readily convertible into cash. The

purchases of the above government bonds and CCTs, which, pursuant to Consob Communication

DEM/11070007 of August 5, 2011, represent investments in "Sovereign debt securities", have been

made in accordance with the Guidelines for the "Management and control of financial risk" adopted by

the Telecom Italia Group since August 2012, in replacement of the previous policies in force.

In the fourth quarter of 2014 adjusted net financial debt increased by 79 million euros compared to
September 30, 2014. Cash flow from operations was offset not only by the tax disbursements of the last
quarter but also by the greater needs, amounting to 0.9 billion euros, deriving from the payments
already made for the purchasing of licenses in Brazil and Argentina.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
TELECOM ITALIA GROUP

The Telecom Italia Group consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 and
the comparative figures for the prior year have been prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and
adopted by the European Union ("IFRS").

The accounting policies and consolidation principles adopted in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements at December 31, 2014 are the same as those adopted in the consolidated
financial statements at December 31, 2013, except for the use of the new Standards and
Interpretations adopted by the Group since January 1, 2014, whose effects are described in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2014, to which the reader is referred.

The Telecom Italia Group, in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established
by IFRS, uses certain alternative performance measures in order to present a better understanding of
the trend of operations and financial condition. Specifically, these alternative performance measures
refer to: EBITDA; EBIT; the organic change in revenues, EBITDA and EBIT; and net financial debt carrying
amount and adjusted net financial debt.

Starting from 2014, Telecom Italia has revised the method for calculating the organic change in
revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, no longer taking non-organic income/expenses, also including non-
recurring items, into that calculation, as it did in the past. As a result, organic changes now include only
the effects of the change in the scope of consolidation and of exchange differences. Figures for the
periods under comparison have been reclassified accordingly. Further details on such measures are
presented under "Alternative performance measures".

Moreover, the part entitled "Business Outlook for the Year 2015" contains forward-looking statements in
relation to the Group's intentions, beliefs or current expectations regarding financial performance and
other aspects of the Group's operations and strategies. Readers of the Annual Report are reminded not
to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements; actual results may differ significantly from
forecasts owing to numerous factors, the majority of which are beyond the scope of the Group's control.

PRINCIPAL CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

The following changes occurred during 2014:

° Telecom Italia Ventures S.r.l. (Domestic Business Unit): established in July 2014;

e Rete A S.p.A. (Media Business Unit): on June 30, 2014 Persidera S.p.A. (former TI Media
Broadcasting S.r.l.) acquired 100% of the company. As a result Rete A entered the Group's scope of

completed on December 1, 2014;

e  TIMB2 S.r.l. (Media Business Unit): established in May 2014;

e Trentino NGN S.r.l. (Domestic Business Unit): on February 28, 2014 the Telecom Italia Group

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

With regard to "Research and Development", this subject is discussed in a specific paragraph of the
Sustainability Section of this Report on Operations, in the chapter "The Community".

EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2014

For details of subsequent events see the specific Note "Events Subsequent to December 31, 2014" in
the consolidated and separate financial statements at December 31, 2014 of the Telecom Italia Group
and Telecom Italia S.p.A., respectively.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR 2015

In 2015, the telecommunications market will continue to experience a decline in traditional services
(voice and accesses), partly offset by the increase in revenues from innovative services thanks to the
growing demand for connectivity and digital services. The combined effect of these trends is expected to
cause a further overall decline in the domestic market, but much more limited than in previous years,
particularly in the Mobile segment. In Brazil the forecast is for growth, albeit at slower rates than in
previous years, as a result of the steady penetration and saturation of the Mobile market, as well as the
migration from traditional voice-SMS messaging services to Internet services and the impact of the
reduction in mobile termination rates (MTRs).

In this scenario, the Telecom Italia Group - as announced in the 2015-2017 Plan - will continue to
defend its market shares and invest in the development of infrastructures, with a sharp increase in
investments in innovative components. Specifically, the five areas of technology development will be
fixed fiber optic ultrabroadband, mobile ultrabroadband, the establishment of new data centers to
support cloud services, international fiber connections, and the transformation of industrial process to
structurally reduce running costs by streamlining and upgrading infrastructures.

The aim of the additional investment is to create the conditions for revenue stabilization and recovery,
based increasingly on the spread of innovative services with digital content.

Investments within the Domestic perimeter will total around 10 billion euros over the plan period, of
which around 5 billion euros exclusively for the innovative component (NGN, LTE, Cloud Computing, Data
Center, Sparkle and Restructuring) which, by 2017, will enable 75% of the population to be reached by
fiber optics and over 95% by 4G. In Brazil, investments will rise to 14 billion reais (over 4 billion euros at
current exchange rates) with the objective of extending 4G coverage to over 15,000 sites and 3G
coverage to over 14,000 sites by 2017.

In this scenario, management - in keeping with the developments identified in the 2015-2017 Three-
Year Plan - expects to see a progressive improvement in operating performance for the current year in
both the Domestic market (with the objective of EBITDA stabilization by 2016) and in Brazil.

MAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The business outlook for 2015 could be affected by risks and uncertainties caused by a multitude of
factors, the majority of which are beyond the Group's control.

In such a scenario, risk management becomes a strategic tool for value creation. The Telecom Italia
Group has adopted an Enterprise Risk Management Model based on the methodology of the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (ERM CoSO Report), which enables the
identification and management of risk in a uniform manner within the Group companies, highlighting
potential synergies between the actors involved in the assessment of the Internal Control and Risk
Management System. The ERM process is designed to identify potential events that may affect the
business, to manage risk within acceptable limits and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
achievement of corporate objectives.

The main risks affecting the business activities of the Telecom Italia Group, which may impact, even
significantly, the ability to achieve the objectives of the Group are presented below.

Strategic risks

Risks related to macro economic factors

The Group's economic and financial situation is subject to the influence of numerous macro economic
factors such as economic growth, political stability, consumer confidence, and changes in interest rates
and exchange rates in the markets in which it operates. The expected results may be affected, in the
domestic market, by the struggling economic recovery associated with a high rate of unemployment,
with the consequent reduction in income available for consumption and, in Brazil, generally by the
slowdown in economic growth.

In addition, the Telecom Italia Group is currently undertaking numerous transactions, including
corporate and extraordinary transactions, whose feasibility and completion could be affected by factors
outside the control of management, such as political and regulatory factors, currency exchange
restrictions, etc.

Risks related to competition

The telecommunications market is characterized by strong competition that may reduce our market
share and lower prices and margins. Competition is focused both on innovative products and services,
and the price of traditional services.

Operational risks

Operational risks inherent in our business relate to possible inadequacies in internal processes, external
factors, fraud, employee error, errors in properly documenting transactions, loss of critical or
commercially sensitive data and failures in systems or network platforms.

Risks related to business continuity

Our success depends heavily on the ability to deliver the services we provide through the IT
infrastructure and network on a continuous and uninterrupted basis. The infrastructure is susceptible to
interruptions due to failures of information and communication technologies, lack of electricity, floods,
storms and human errors. Unexpected problems in installations, system failures, hardware and software
failures, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the quality of services and cause service
interruptions. Each of these events could result in a reduction in traffic and a reduction in revenues
and/or in an increase of restoration costs, with an adverse impact on the level of customer satisfaction
and number of customers, as well as our reputation.

Risks related to the development of fixed and mobile networks.

To maintain and expand our customer portfolio in each of the markets in which we operate, it is
necessary to maintain, update and improve existing networks in a timely manner. A reliable and high
quality network is necessary to maintain the customer base and minimize the terminations to protect

Telecom Italia Group Main risks and uncertainties | 74
Report on Operations


--- Page 61 ---

the Company's revenues from erosion. The maintenance and improvement of existing installations

depend on our ability to:

e upgrade the capabilities of the networks to provide customers with services that are closer to their
needs;

e increase the geographical coverage of innovative services;

e upgrade old systems and networks to adapt them to new technologies.

Risks of internal/external fraud

The Group has adopted an organizational model to prevent fraud. However, the implementation of this
model cannot ensure the total absence of these risks. Dishonest activities and illegal acts committed by
people inside and outside the organization could adversely affect the Company's operating results,
financial position and image.

Risks related to Disputes and Litigation

The Group has to deal with disputes and litigation with tax authorities, regulators, competition
authorities, other telecommunications operators and other entities. The possible impacts of such
proceedings are generally uncertain. In the event of settlement unfavorable to the Group, these issues
may, individually or as whole, have an adverse effect on its operating results, financial position and cash
flows.

Financial risks

The Telecom Italia Group may be exposed to financial risks such as risks arising from fluctuations in
interest rates and exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and risks related to the performance of the
equity markets in general, and - more specifically - risks related to the performance of the share price
of the Group companies. These risks may adversely impact the earnings and the financial structure of
the Group. Accordingly, to manage those risks, Telecom Italia Group has established guidelines, at
central level, which must be followed for operational management, identification of the most suitable
financial instruments to meet set goals, and monitoring the results achieved. In particular, in order to
mitigate the liquidity risk, the Group aims to maintain an "adequate level of financial flexibility", in terms
of cash and syndicated committed credit lines, enabling it to cover refinancing requirements at least for
the next 12 - 18 months.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks

Regulatory risks

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated. In this context, new decisions by the regulator and

changes in the regulatory environment may affect the expected results of the Group. More specifically,

the elements which introduce uncertainty are:

e lack of predictability in the timing of the introduction and consequent results of new processes;

e decisions with retroactive effect (i.e. revision of prices relating to prior years as a result of an
administrative judgment) with potential impact on the timing of return on investment;

e decisions that can influence the technological choices made and to be made, with potential impact
on the timing of return on investment.

Compliance risks

The Telecom Italia Group may be exposed to risks of non-compliance due to non-observance/ breach of
internal (self-regulation such as, for example, bylaws, code of ethics) and external rules (laws and
regulations), with consequent judicial or administrative penalties, financial losses or reputational
damage.

The Group aims to ensure that processes, procedures, systems and corporate conduct comply with legal
requirements. There may be some necessary time lags in making the processes compliant when non-
conformity has been identified.

On June 16, 2014, Generali, Intesa Sanpaolo and Mediobanca also exercised the right to ask for the
demerger of Telco in accordance with the shareholders' agreement. As a result, on June 26, the board of
directors of Telco approved the partial non-proportional demerger of the company, which will result in an
allocation, to the four newly-established beneficiary companies (each fully controlled by each of the
shareholders Telef6nica, Mediobanca, Generali and Intesa Sanpaolo), of the respective interests held by
Telco in Telecom Italia - updated due to the effect of the dilution of the Telco investment in the ordinary
share capital of Telecom Italia S.p.A., resulting from the issuance of new ordinary shares for the
execution, effective from July 31, 2014, of the 2014 Broad-Based Share Ownership Plan - and therefore
specifically: 14.72% to the newco controlled by Telefénica, to 4.30% to the newco of the Generali group,
and 1.64% to each of the newcos controlled respectively by Intesa Sanpaolo and Mediobanca. The
demerger resolution was passed by the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of Telco on July 9, 2014. As
of the effective date of the demerger all the effects of the shareholders' agreement in place between the
shareholders of Telco shall cease.

Under the demerger plan the transaction is subject, among other things, to obtaining the authorizations
from Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econémica (CADE, Brazilian antitrust authority), Agéncia
Nacional de Telecomunicagées (Anatel, Brazilian regulatory authority), Comisién Nacional de Defensa de
la Competencia (CNDC, Argentine antitrust authority) and Istituto per la Vigilanza sulle Assicurazioni
(IVASS formerly ISVAP, Italian regulatory authority of insurance companies).

To date IVASS and Anatel have issued their authorizations. There is no information available on the
status of the authorization procedures with the CADE and CNDC. As far as the Company is concerned
directly, Anatel has issued its approval subject, among other things, to the suspension of all political
rights of Telefénica in Telecom Italia and its subsidiaries, ordering that this limitation be added by
Telecom Italia S.p.A. to its Company Bylaws. Compliance with this provision must be proved by filing an
authenticated copy of the amended Bylaws with the Authority.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In this Report on Operations, in the consolidated financial statements of the Telecom Italia Group and in
the separate financial statements of the Parent, Telecom Italia S.p.A., for the year ended December 31,
2014, in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS, certain
alternative performance measures are presented for purposes of a better understanding of the trend of
operations and the financial condition. Such measures, which are also presented in other periodical
financial reports (half-year financial Report at June 30 and interim Reports at March 31 and
September 30) should, however, not be considered as a substitute for those required by IFRS.

The alternative performance measures used are described below:

e EBITDA: this financial measure is used by Telecom Italia as the financial target in internal
presentations (business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors). It
represents a useful unit of measurement for the evaluation of the operating performance of the
Group (as a whole and at the Business Unit level) and the Parent, Telecom Italia S.p.A., in addition to
EBIT. These measures are calculated as follows:

Profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations

+ Finance expenses

- Finance income

+/- Other expenses (income) from investments ®

+/- Share of losses (profits) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method 2)
EBIT - Operating profit (loss)

+/- Impairment losses (reversals) on non-current assets

+/- Losses (gains) on disposals of non-current assets

+ Depreciation and amortization

EBITDA - Operating profit (loss) before depreciation and amortization, Capital gains (losses) and Impairment reversals
(losses) on non-current assets

(1) "Expenses (income) from investments" for Telecom Italia S.p.A.

(2) Line item in Group consolidated financial statements only.

e Organic change in Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT: these measures express changes (amount and/or

percentage) in revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, excluding, where applicable, the effects of the change in
the scope of consolidation and exchange differences. In particular, starting from 2014, Telecom
Italia has revised the method for calculating the organic change in revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, and it
no longer takes non-organic income/expenses, also including non-recurring item, into account in that
calculation as it did in the past. As noted above, organic changes now include only the effects of the
change in the scope of consolidation and of exchange differences. Figures for the year 2013 under
comparison have been reclassified accordingly.
Telecom Italia believes that the presentation of the organic change in revenues, EBITDA and EBIT
allows for a more complete and effective understanding of the operating performance of the Group
(as a whole and at the Business Unit level) and the Parent. This method of presenting information is
also used in presentations to analysts and investors. This Report on Operations provides a
reconciliation between the "reported figure" and the "comparable" figure.

e Net Financial Debt: Telecom Italia believes that Net Financial Debt represents an accurate indicator

of its ability to meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less Cash and
Cash Equivalents and other Financial Assets. The Report on Operations includes two tables showing
the amounts taken from the statement of financial position and used to calculate the Net Financial
Debt of the Group and Parent respectively.
To better represent the real performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual indicator
(called "Net financial debt carrying amount"), "Adjusted net financial debt" is also shown, which
excludes effects that are purely accounting and non-monetary in nature deriving from the fair value
measurement of derivatives and related financial assets and liabilities.
