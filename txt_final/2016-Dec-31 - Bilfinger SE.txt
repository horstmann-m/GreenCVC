to German stock company law, is also subject to specific SE regulations and the German law on imple-
menting a European company as well as the German SE Employee Involvement Act. The management
bodies of the company are the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting.
The Executive Board of Bilfinger SE manages the company in its own responsibility. The Supervisory
Board appoints, supervises and advises the Executive Board and is directly involved in key decisions
affecting the company. These bodies work in close cooperation for the benefit of Bilfinger. Details are
described in the declaration of corporate governance on the company's website at www.bilfinger.com

B.1.3. Organization and business segments

Bilfinger SE is a holding without its own business activities. The operating activities are organized
decentrally and are carried out through subsidiaries which act on the market as independent profit
centers. The operating companies are allocated to divisions which in 2016 each belonged to one of the
two business segments Industrial and Power.

As of April 1, 2016 we had reduced the number of divisions in the Industrial business segment to four.

REPORTING STRUCTURE

Industrial business segment Power business segment
Divisions: Divisions:
Industrial Maintenance Power

Insulation, Scaffolding and Painting

Oil and Gas

Engineering Solutions

The companies of the former Engineering, Automation and Control and Industrial Fabrication and Instal-
ation divisions were formally combined in the reporting structure to form the new Engineering Solutions
division. In addition, the Support Services division was formally disbanded and its companies more
closely aligned to Industrial’s core businesses through the allocation to other divisions. In the Power
business segment, the operating companies are combined ina single division.

ndustrial business segment Bilfinger is one of the world’s leading providers of integrated technical
services for the process industry and energy sector. The key to our success is a comprehensive range of
services that cover the entire lifecycle of industrial plants — from engineering to maintenance. In 2016,
he regional focus of the Industrial business segment was on Europe and the United States.

Reclassification of the Building and Facility and Power business segments in financial year
2016 In February 2016, we sold the Water Technologies division to Chinese company Chengdu Techcent
Environment Group, the deconsolidation was carried out as of March 31, 2016. In June 2016, the Build-
ing, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions were sold to financial investor EQT and deconsolidated
as of September 1, 2016. The sold units of the former Building and Facility business segment are there-
fore presented under discontinued operations in this Annual Report. The remaining unit Government
Services is presented under ‘Consolidation / other’.

At the same time, the selling process for the Power business segment begun in mid-2015 was refo-
cused. Rather than focusing on a total sale, we have instead initiated a comprehensive restructuring and
organizational repositioning of the activities. In accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), Power will be once again presented as continuing operations in the Annual Report
2016.

Against the backdrop of this reclassification, the previous year figures have been adjusted accord-
ingly in this Annual Report.

As of January 1, 2017, a new organizational structure was introduced, the basic principles of which
are described in chapter B.4 Outlook.

B.1.4 Strategy and objectives

A process for the strategic repositioning of the company was introduced in financial year 2016. Imple-
mentation will be carried out in 2017. Explanations of the principles as well as the forecasts for future
development is included in chapter 8.4 Outlook. Information on research and development activities is
included in chapter B.2.7.5 Innovation.

B.1.5 Financial management system

Our key financial management metrics for financial year 2016 include figures for growth, profitability,
capital efficiency as well as our capital structure. The most important of these are output volume,
adjusted EBITA and return on adjusted EBITA, adjusted free cash flow and return on capital employed.

Growth and volume In addition to the Group's revenue, the figure for output volume also includes
our proportion of the goods and services supplied by joint ventures and consortiums. Their planning is
conducted on the basis of orders received and order backlog. Profitable organic growth in output volume
forms a cornerstone of our strategy for increasing Bilfinger’s enterprise value. In addition, targeted
acquisitions can contribute to the growth in output volume.

B.1.5.1 Profitability

EBITA/ adjusted EBITA/ adjusted EBITA margin The indicator of operating profit of the corporate
units and of the Group, and thus the measure of earnings for segment reporting, is ‘earnings before
interest, taxes and amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions’ (EBITA). When performing such
an analysis, the focus is on the profit margin — calculated as operating profit as a percentage of output
volume.

We are focusing here on ‘adjusted EBITA’ with adjustments made for special items. For better com-
parability of operating performance over time, special items are eliminated. These include, for example,
gains on disposals, restructuring measures as well as expenses in connection with the further develop-
ment of our compliance system and the conclusion of old cases.

Net profit Net profit consists of operating profit plus / minus amortization of intangible assets, finan-
cial income and expense and taxes. With regard to net profit we also make reference to an ‘adjusted
net profit’ with adjustments made for the above-mentioned special items as well as for amortization of
intangible assets.

Dividend policy We pursue a sustainable dividend policy with the objective of letting our shareholders
participate appropriately in the Group's success. Considering the sound balance sheet and planned pos-
itive business development, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual
General Meeting a dividend payout of €1.00 per share for financial year 2016, despite the negative
adjusted net profit. Subject to the Group developing as planned, the Executive Board and Supervisory
Board aim to keep the dividend constant, until the dividend distribution policy comes into effect. This
aims to pay out to our shareholders between 40 and 60 percent of adjusted net profit, depending on the
foreseeable medium-term development of the company.

Share buyback The company plans to cancel its treasury shares in the amount of about 4 percent. A
proposal will also be made that the Annual General Meeting approve a new authorization to buy back
shares in the maximum amount of 10 percent. On the basis of anticipated business development, the
Executive Board intends to propose to the Supervisory Board a share buyback program with a volume of
up to €150 million which should begin in financial year 2017.

B.1.5.2 Capital efficiency

Value added and ROCE The value added by ou r business segments and the Group is measured with
the help of value and cash oriented management. We employ our capital in a targeted manner in order
to achieve high value added. Positive value added is only achieved for the Group if the return on the
average capital employed is higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). In this regard and
in the financial year, we switched to a calculation after taxes and including special items. For further
details, please refer to the corresponding explanations in chapter B.2.2 Results of operations — Value
added. The parameters are determined as long-term average values, are regularly reviewed, and are
adjusted for any relevant changes in the market environment.

Adjusted free cash flow / cash conversion / net working capital For the operationalization of
value-oriented management, we also orient ourselves toward the so-called adjusted free cash flow
and the cash conversion for each business segment. A major factor to be considered in this regard is

the change in net working capital. Net working capital is calculated as the difference between current
assets excluding cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities excluding financial debt. A reduction
in net working capital leads to lower capital employed and thus also contributes to an increase in the
return on capital employed (ROCE) and in the value added by the business segment concerned.

Adjusted free cash flow is calculated on the basis of cash inflow from operating activities less net
investment in property, plant and equipment as the adjustment for special items. We calculate cash
conversion on the basis of the ratio between adjusted free cash flow (corrected for interest and taxes)
and adjusted EBITA.

Investments Although compared with some industries our business is not very capital intensive,
planned additions to property, plant and equipment are subject to intensive investment controlling.

B.1.5.3. Capital structure and liquidity

Net debt and dynamic gearing ratio To manage liquidity, we focus on the key figures net debt and
dynamic gearing ratio, which is the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. In both cases, we also consider — as in
the framework of operating profit measurement — adjusted figures for which we eliminate special items.

B.1.5.4. Other key figures

On the basis of our strategic corporate planning, we regularly review the effects on our financial risk
profile of various scenarios for the business and financial development of the Group. In addition to those
mentioned above, key figures include so-called gearing as well as ‘cash-flow protection’.

B.2. Economic report 2016

B.2.1 General statement of the Executive Board on the economic situation

Bilfinger delivered a sound performance in financial year 2016 in a challenging environment. The year
was characterized by far-reaching changes. The sale of the Building, Facility Services and Real Estate
divisions, the refocusing of the selling process for the Power business segment started in 2015 and the
resulting reclassifications explained in chapter B.7.3 Organization and business segments necessitated
a mid-year adjustment of reference values for our forecasts for full-year 2016. In this context, state-
ments made on the expected development of output volume and adjusted EBITA were not fundamentally
revised, but in part further substantiated.

Our business in the Industrial segment was reflected by lower project volumes and the market sit-
uation in the oil and gas sector. In the Power business segment, we saw declines primarily due to less
business in home markets and in the German and international project business, where we are taking a
highly selective approach in the wake of competitive and price pressures.

B.2.1.1 Economic environment

Overall economic development

Economic growth of the Eurozone slowed slightly in the reporting year to 1.7 percent (previous year: 2.0
percent) (DG ECFIN, p. 158). The gradually decreasing effects of the energy price drop, nearly stagnant
global trade and new political uncertainties following the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom have
slowed growth. However, monetary policy with extensive bond purchases and zero interest rate policy
as well as substantial increases in state spending both remain expansive.

Germany achieved strong growth rates once again at 1.9 percent (DG ECFIN, p. 1). This growth was
primarily driven by private consumption, increasing state spending and a construction industry boom. By
comparison, companies’ willingness to invest remained subdued.

In Northern Europe, economic growth remained low, with the exception of Sweden. Norway, which
is heavily dependent on commodity prices, achieved only slightly positive growth of 0.7 percent (DG
ECFIN, FEB17). The Eastern European EU countries recorded above-average growth; in Poland, GDP
increased by 3.1 percent (DG ECFIN, FEB17).

Investments in equipment by companies in the Eurozone increased significantly by 4.2 percent (DG
ECFIN, p. 163), however this growth remains restrained in comparison with earlier phases of economic
recovery. Although companies with a good financial standing benefited from further reduced interest
rates and historically good financing conditions, uncertainties regarding the status of the global econ-
omy, restrained export demand and increasing political risks prevented a stronger investment dynamic.

In the USA, economic growth increased over the course of the year, however growth of just 1.6
percent was achieved for the full year (DG ECFIN, p. 1). The labor market reached full employment once
more, with unemployment below 5 percent. Investment demand from companies recovered significantly.

Industry
In 2016, the chemical and pharmaceutical industry remained the most important customer group for
the German industrial services sector with around 50 percent (Liin, p. 31). Performance for this sector

in Germany and Europe was mixed. The decrease in chemical prices only ended in the third quarter. The
industry suffered a significant decline in sales, which was at -4.4 percent compared with the previous

year until halfway through the year

(CEFIC).

In addition to the unfavorable price situation, continued weakness in growth in Asian emerging
markets in particular made the chemical business challenging (VCl). Development of the chemical and
pharmaceutical industry in the USA was more favorable with an improved volume market (VCI US).

In light of this economic development, the European market for industrial services was stable in the
reporting year, with growth of between 4 and 5 percent (Lin, p. 36). Growth in the European market was
slightly above that of the German market, which was between 3 and 4 percent (Liin, p. 14). The neigh-
boring Benelux countries together with Switzerland and Austria remain important target countries for
expansion strategies of German service providers, while the United Kingdom is viewed with increasing

this has also resulted in increased pressure on prices for suppliers. The trend continued in Norway's
offshore production fields due to advancements in drilling and production technology, leading to an
increasing share in deep-sea production (USEIA Offshore Oil Production).

Energy

Decreases in maintenance budgets for conventional power plants continued in Germany in the reporting
year. The critical situation for large energy suppliers and conventional power plant operators following
the energy transformation continued. The declining market for power plant services continued to be
characterized by overcapacities and strong margin pressure.

The forced stretching of maintenance budgets for existing conventional power plants for business

regions is increasingly endangering the substance of these plants, according to industry assessments
(FDBR). The highly-volatile supply of renewable energies means that an extremely flexible use of coal-
fired power plants is now necessary, something that existing plants are often not designed for. In light
of ever-decreasing maintenance budgets, it was not previously possible to complete such upgrades, so
that plants are at times operated despite extensive wear and tear (FDBR).
In 2016, the share of nuclear power in energy production fell significantly (-15.4 percent in the first
six months). This gap was primarily closed through increased electricity production using gas power
plants and a strong increase in offshore wind power. The share of coal and lignite declined slightly, but
ill accounted for some 40 percent of electricity production (all figures: BDEW).

The market for power plant services was significantly more stable in Central and Eastern European
EU countries. Poland continues to rely primarily on coal-fired power plants for electricity generation,
which account for almost 90 percent of electricity produced and ensure the country is generally not de-
pendent on energy imports. New coal-fired power plants are being constructed and existing plants are
being modernized in order to meet stricter EU standards for efficiency and environmental compatibility
and ensure the continued use of coal. (TI Poland)

In the Gulf states, dramatically reduced oil revenues in the last two years have led to an adjustment
of the expansion plans in the energy sector. Saudi Arabia is increasingly involving private investors.

In South Africa, a decline in power outages was achieved — a result of both capacity expansion and
improved maintenance as well as a drop in demand. The financial standing of the country has fallen and
the chances of realizing the planned further capacity expansion in electricity generation have become
more unpredictable against this backdrop (TI South Africa economic outlook, Tl South Africa economic
trend).

B.2.1.2 Factors influencing business development
In the Industrial business segment, production utilization in the process industry, the demand for
outsourcing solutions, regular plant inspections (turnarounds), combined services and full services as
well as solutions for international customer locations had a key influence on the development of our
business.

In the Power business segment, important demand factors for our business development include the
long-term foreseeable energy needs, the age of existing power plants, plant efficiency and environmen-
tal protection requirements as well as the energy mix in our markets.

Orders received by the Bilfinger Group amounted to €4,056 million in financial year 2016, corresponding
to a decrease of 6 percent as compared to the prior-year figure. The order backlog of €2,618 million at

the end of the year was 10 percent lower than a year earlier. Output volume declined significantly by
16 percent to €4,219 million and was thereby slightly higher than the most recent forecast of €4.1 billion.

In the Industrial business segment, orders received totaled €3,255 million — at the level of output volume
for 2016. There was stable demand for ongoing maintenance services for production plants in the Euro-
pean market. However, reduced investment and maintenance demand from our oil and gas customers as
well as continued competitive pressure negatively impacted new business. Order backlog reached the
level of the previous year at €2,081 million. As expected, output volume declined significantly to €3,197

million and was thereby slightly higher than the most recent forecast of €3.1 billion.

In the Power business segment, orders received of €746 million were below the prior-year figure, as
was the order backlog of €500 million on the balance sheet date. Output volume decreased to €967
million in 2016. Overall, demand in the project business remained low. In Germany, the scope of services
demanded continued to decline, particularly as a result of insufficient capacity utilization and economic
efficiency of the power plants. By contrast, stable demand was recorded in the service business in South
Africa and the Middle East.

Other operating income and expense

The balance of other operating income and expenses was negative at -€151 million (previous year: -€417
million). Included in this figure are restructuring expenses especially in the Power business segment in
the amount of €80 million (previous year: €112 million). Disposals and write-downs on subsidiaries as
part of the streamlining of the portfolio resulted in an expense of €88 million (previous year: €8 million).
In the previous year, the disposal and remeasurement of subsidiaries resulted in earnings of €54 million.
A goodwill impairment of €330 million was recognized in the Power segment in the previous year.

Income from investments accounted for using the equity method

Income from investments accounted for using the equity method is composed of the income and expens-
es from associates and joint ventures. It decreased to €6 million following the sale of shares (previous
year: €15 million).

EBITA / EBITA adjusted / EBIT

Adjusted EBITA improved significantly as compared to the prior year. Following -€23 million in the
previous year, it reached a positive value again of €15 million in the reporting year. Exchange rate
effects had a negative impact of -€4 million. In relation to output volume the adjusted EBITA margin was
0.4 percent (previous year: -€0.5 percent).

increased slightly to 3.7 percent (previous year: 3.5 percent). On a comparative basis — adjusted for
deconsolidation and exchange rate effects — EBITA amounted to €128 million, the same as in the pre-
vious year.

In the Power business segment, EBITA improved significantly to -€30 million (previous year: -€69
million) due to positive effects from capacity adjustments and lower project losses with optimized risk
management and despite a significant decline in output volume. The figure did, however, remain nega-
tive. The EBITA margin was -3.1 percent (previous year: -5.4 percent).

Adjusted negative EBITA not allocated to the business segments improved to -€75 million (previous
year: -€82 million). This is attributable, among other things, to capacity adjustments at Group headquar-
ters introduced in the reporting year as well as reduced costs for special projects. By contrast, income
from investments allocated to headquarters declined following the sale of shares. Including the special
items described under Adjusted earnings per share, EBITA totaled -€221 million (previous year: -€157
million). After deducting amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions as well as — in the previous
year — the goodwill impairment in the Power segment of €330 million, an EBIT of -€231 remains (previ-
ous year: -€500 million).

Interest result

Net interest expense improved to -€22 million (previous year: -€31 million). Interest income increased
to €10 million (previous year: €7 million) as a result of interest income from the deferred purchase price
claim from the sale of Building and Facility. Current interest expense decreased to €23 million (previous
year: €30 million), in particular as a result of the drop in interest expense for project financing. The
interest expense from the increase in the retirement benefit obligation — offset against the income from
plan assets — amounted to €6 million, as in the previous year. The interest expense for minority interest
totaled €3 million (previous year: €2 million).

Earnings before and after taxes

Earnings from discontinued operations totaled -€253 million (previous year: -€531 million) before income
taxes and -€279 million (previous year: -€591 million) after taxes. Despite the negative result before tax,
a tax expense of €26 million (previous year: €60 million) was incurred. This has two primary causes. On
the one hand, earnings before taxes include non-deductible write-downs and disposal losses, on the
other hand nearly no deferred taxes were capitalized for tax losses in the current year, as the utilization
of tax-loss carryforwards is not reasonably certain in the relevant period. The basic claim in domestic
tax-loss carryforwards remains unaffected.

Earnings after taxes from discontinued operations concerns the sold units Building, Facility Services,
Real Estate, Water Technologies, Offshore Systems, the former construction activities as well as marine
construction. The result of €551 million (previous year: €64 million) in the reporting year is primarily
attributable to the sale of the Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions, which produced a
capital gain in the amount of €538 million. The prior year figure included the current result from the
former Building and Facility business segment.

Minority interest

Profit attributable to minority interest amounted to -€1 million in the reporting period (previous year:
-€17 million). In the previous year, this particularly included the proportionate share of the write-down
of investments in the now sold production site for offshore steel foundations in Poland and of South
African companies in the Power business segment.

Net profit / earnings per share

Net profit amounted to €271 million (previous year: -€510 million), with earnings per share at €6.13 (pre-
vious year: -€11.54). Net profit from continuing operations adjusted for amortization of intangible assets
from acquisitions and goodwill impairments and for the special items described below improved to
-€8 million (previous year: -€30 million); adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations amount
to -€0.17 (previous year: -€0.68).

Dividends

Considering the sound balance sheet and planned positive business development, the Executive Board
and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend payout of €1.00 per
share for financial year 2016.

Adjusted earnings per share

The calculation of earnings per share in accordance with IFRS is presented in the income statement.
Earnings per share after adjusting for special items and the amortization and impairment of intangible
assets is a metric that is suited to enabling comparability over time and forecasting future profitability.

Special items in EBITA in the amount of €90 million (previous year: €147 million) resulted from restruc-
turing expenses including special write-downs on property, plant and equipment of €17 million (previous
year: €21 million), particularly in the Power business segment. Expenses for the program to increase ef-
ficiency in administration in the amount of €29 million (previous year: €8 million) are also included. Costs
of €23 million (previous year: €27 million) were incurred in connection with the further improvement of
our compliance system. Disposals and write-downs on subsidiaries as part of the streamlining of the
portfolio resulted in an expense of €94 million. This is offset by a net gain from the sale of shares in the
amount of €48 million in the previous year.

Scheduled amortization on intangible assets from acquisitions and impairment of goodwill totaling
€10 million (previous year: €14 million) relates to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from
purchase price allocation following acquisitions and is therefore of a temporary nature. In the previous
year, an adjustment was also made for a goodwill impairment in the Power segment in the amount of
€330 million.

Adjustments to income tax expense take into account the tax effects of the special items in EBITA
and the amortization on intangible assets from acquisitions, as well as the non-capitalization of deferred
tax assets on losses in the reporting year and the change to write-downs on deferred tax assets on tax-
loss carryforwards from previous years. The adjusted effective tax rate was 31 percent.

Value added — the difference between return on capital employed (ROCE) and the cost of capital — is an
important key figure for measuring profitability of capital employed and for the efficient controlling of
capital employed. We include continuing operations in order to provide better comparability over time in
the consideration of return on capital employed.

Adjusted EBITA previously served as a basis for the calculation of the return. In the reporting year,
for the first time we have used an after-tax calculation to determine the return, based on EBIT in-
cluding interest income. This means that, unlike in the past, we also take into account special items,
amortization or depreciation of capitalized assets from acquisitions as well as goodwill impairment in
the calculation of the return. We thus want to ensure that all success components are reflected in our
eturn on capital employed. We have adjusted the prior-year figures accordingly. The so-called preferred
participation notes transferred in the course of the sale of the Building, Facility Services and Real Estate
divisions were eliminated during the calculation of capital employed, as these were not offset by a
corresponding current yield in the return.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group amounts to 7.4 percent after taxes (pre-
vious year: 8.2 percent). ROCE of the business segments is compared with segment-specific cost-of-cap-
al rates. This decreased to 7.4 percent (previous year: 7.9 percent) as a result of the low interest rate
for the Industrial business segment. By contrast, in the Power business segment the figure increased to

9.8 percent (previous year: 9.0 percent) as a result of a higher beta factor. Further details can be found
in the chapter D.1. Return-on-capital-employed controlling. The average capital employed of continuing
operations decreased to €1,789 million in the reporting year (previous year: €1,843 million). The return
rom continuing operations — the previous year includes a goodwill impairment in the Power business

segment in the amount of €330 million — improved significantly, but remains negative at -€247 million
previous year: -€553 million). The negative ROCE therefore also improved to -13.8 percent (previous
year: -30.0 percent) and the negative absolute value added to -€380 million (previous year: -€704 mil-
ion). This is primarily attributable to development in the Power business segment where the prior-year
igure was significantly burdened by the goodwill impairment. With ROCE of -7.6 percent (previous year:
-88.4 percent), value added amounted to -€45 million (previous year: -€420 million). In the Industrial
business segment, ROCE was unchanged from the previous year at 6.5 percent. Value added improved
0 -€11 million (previous year: -€18 million) as a result of the lower cost of capital. Value added by head-
quarters and consolidation was negative at -€324 million (previous year: -€266 million), particularly as a
result of high negative special items.

For the analysis of net assets, in order to gain better comparability with the figures as of December
31, 2016, assets and liabilities of discontinued operations of the former divisions Water Technologies,
Building, Facility Services and Real Estate are each shown separately in an item on the assets side and
an item on the liabilities side of the pro-forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

The balance sheet total declined to €4.0 billion (previous year: €5.2 billion) as a result of the sale of
the Water Technologies, Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions. This is evident from the
decrease of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale with a simultaneous increase in cash and
cash equivalents.

On the assets side, non-current assets increased to €1,690 million (previous year: €1,525 million).
Intangible assets decreased to €849 million (previous year: €895 million). Goodwill included here
amounted to €822 million (previous year: €848 million). Property, plant and equipment decreased signif-
icantly to €383 million (previous year: €471 million). This was reflected by a comparatively low invest-
ment level as well as disposals and special write-downs.

An increase to €458 million (previous year: €159 million) was recorded in other non-current assets.
This is due to the recognition of non-cash purchase price components from the sale of the Building,
Facility Services and Real Estate divisions — a receivable from a purchase price deferral of €103 million
and a preferred participation note of €195 million.

Receivables and other current assets decreased to €1,216 million (previous year: €1,380 million).
Receivables from services not yet rendered (WIP) were reduced to €300 million (previous year: €363
million).

Cash and cash equivalents increased to €1,032 million (previous year: €427 million) at the end of the
year due to revenues from the aforementioned sales; current and non-current financial debt was nearly
unchanged at €522 million (previous year: €526 million). Net liquidity amounted to €510 million as of the
balance sheet date (previous year: net debt €99 million).

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale fell significantly to €81 million (previous year: €1,853
million) and €68 million (previous year: €1,146 million) respectively due to the sale of the Water Technol-
ogies, Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions.

Pension provisions increased to €304 million (previous year: €295 million). An increase as a result
of the decreased discount rate in the Eurozone from 2.25 percent to 1.60 percent as well as valuation
adjustments was countered by a reduction due to deconsolidation.

Other non-current liabilities also decreased as a result of lower deferred taxes to €83 million (pre-
vious year: €93 million).

Other current liabilities decreased to €1,421 million (previous year: €1,707 million), and advance
payments received included here fell to €123 million (previous year: €153 million). Negative working
capital decreased to -€205 million (previous year: -€327 million).

As a result of positive earnings after taxes of €272 million, equity increased to €1,621 million (pre-
vious year: €1,418 million). Changes in equity of -€84 million had an opposing effect. This related to
negative effects from the remeasurement of defined benefit pension plans of -€68 million and exchange

rate effects of -€19 million. The

equity ratio on the balance sheet date increased to 40 percent, well

above the prior-year figure of 27 percent.

Financing

The main source of funds for corporate financing is our business operations and the cash they generate.
This is based not only on operating profits, but also on the stringent management of working capital.
For the purpose of general corporate financing, which is carried out under consideration of matching
maturities, our main banks have provided a firmly committed, syndicated credit facility of €300 million,
available until June 30, 2018, which had not been utilized at the balance sheet date. The previous credit
facility in the amount of €500 million was adjusted to €300 million due to the reduced financing need in
the context of the sale of the Water Technologies, Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions.
The respective interest rate for drawings depends on the interest rate period selected; the credit margin
is oriented toward a rating grid. The syndicated cash line includes a financial covenant in the form of a
limitation of the dynamic gearing ratio (adjusted net debt / adjusted EBITDA). We also have additional
short-term bilateral credit commitments of approximately €130 million. In 2012, a €500 million bond

with maturity in 2019 was issued with a fixed interest rate over the entire period. We have credit by
way of bank guarantees of €1.7 billion from various banks and bonding insurers available to meet the
needs of the project business, which is not fully utilized. Detailed information on existing financial debt
is provided in chapter C.4 Notes to the consolidated financial statements, Note 25.

Financial debt amounts to €522 million as of the balance sheet date (previous year: €526 million). Of

that total, €510 million is non-current (previous year: €513 million) and €12 million is current (previous

bonds being issued. We report in detail on the existing authorizations of the Executive Board to raise
capital in chapter B.5 Takeover relevant information pursuant to Section 289 Subsection 4 and Section

The income statement of the company financial statements of Bilfinger SE is characterized by its holding
function. Revenue amounted to €107 million (previous year: €121 million) and resulted almost solely
from output volume charged to companies of the Group.

Other operating income of €321 million (previous year: €194 million) primarily relates to gains from
the disposal of equity interests. Of this, €275 million was attributable to the sale of Bilfinger Real Estate
Solutions GmbH and €45 million was attributable to Bilfinger Water Technologies GmbH. In the previous
year, in connection with an internal reorganization of the affiliate structure, there was income from
valuation adjustments in the amount of €688 million.

Other income comes from currency translation and hedging as well as from the reduction of write-
downs on receivables from subsidiaries.

Other operating expenses in the amount of €333 million (previous year: €426 million) primarily in-
clude non-personnel administrative expenses, rents and leases, IT costs, insurance premiums, legal
and consulting expenses, expenses from currency translation and hedging, other service and personnel
expenses, losses from the disposal of subsidiaries and additions to provisions. The decline in compari-
son with the previous year is particularly attributable to lower losses from disposals, write-downs and
provisions in the investment area. Expenses from currency hedging and translation have also decreased.

Earnings from financial assets of -€30 million (previous year: €78 million) mainly comprises income
from profit-and-loss-transfer agreements, dividends received from Group companies and impairments
of investments. The decrease is mainly the result of lower income from profit-and-loss-transfer agree-

Financial assets decreased by €701 million to €2,061 million. The decline is attributable to the sale
of the companies of the former Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions. Non-cash purchase
price components from this transaction, consisting of a preferred participation note and a vendor claim
totaling €298 million are included as financial assets.

Receivables and other assets of €310 million (previous year: €750 million) mainly comprise receiva-
bles from subsidiaries in connection with the Group’s centralized corporate financing. The decline here
is also primarily attributable to the loss of receivables from the aforementioned sold companies as well
as from the sold Bilfinger Water Technologies.

The significant increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from earnings from the discussed
sale of investments.

The excess of plan assets over pension liabilities results from the existing surplus cover of pension
provisions through plan assets.

The other side of the balance sheet includes equity of €1,634 million (previous year: €1,625 million),
provisions of €258 million (previous year: €243 million) and liabilities of €1,548 million (previous year:
€2,072 million).

Provisions include defined benefit obligations in the amount of €23 million (previous year: €23 mil-
lion), tax provisions of €21 million (previous year: €26 million) and other provisions of €215 million
(previous year: €194 million).

Pension provisions relate to obligations not covered by plan assets.

The increase in other provisions results from provisions for warranties and other liabilities in con-
nection with the sale of the Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions.

Liabilities in the amount of €993 million (previous year: €1,493 million) include liabilities to asso-
ciates from deposits in connection with centralized cash pooling. Here the decline is also particularly
attributable to the loss of liabilities to sold subsidiaries.

They also include financial debt in the amount of €500 million, as in the previous year, for a primary
unsecured bond issued in December 2012 with a term until December 2019.

The equity ratio was 47 percent at the balance sheet date (previous year: 41 percent). The increase
resulted in almost unchanged equity from the decrease in the balance sheet total.

Opportunities and risks
The business development of Bilfinger SE as Group holding is generally subject to the same risks and
opportunities as the Bilfinger Group.

As the parent company of the Bilfinger Group, Bilfinger SE is included in the Group-wide internal
control and risk-management system.

Outlook

As the parent company of the Group without any business operations of its own, Bilfinger SE receives
revenue primarily from its subsidiaries. Expectations with regard to the Group's business development
will generally affect the earnings of Bilfinger SE. Because financial year 2016 was shaped by high
income from the sale of subsidiaries, we anticipate lower earnings for financial year 2017.

Declaration of corporate governance in accordance with Section 289a

of the German Commercial Code (HGB)

The declaration of corporate governance pursuant to Section 289 a of the German Commercial Code
(HGB) has been made available on the company’s website (www.bilfinger.com) under the heading
‘Company/Corporate Governance’.

B.2.6 Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations include the sold units Building, Facility Services, Real Estate, Water Technolo-
gies, Offshore Systems, the former construction activities as well as marine construction.

B.2.7 Non-financial aspects of business operations

The comprehensive reporting on non-financial aspects of our business activities in 2016 is included in
the Sustainability Report, which will be published in May 2017 in the Internet at www.bilfinger.com. The
focus of the content of our sustainability reporting is derived from the materiality assessment conducted
in 2015, through which we identified the significant aspects for our company. We have evaluated and
prioritized the results according to their relevance.

RELEVANT NON-FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS*

* Evaluated and prioritized on the basis of the materiality assessment conducted in 2015

The requirements of the German Accounting Standards (DRS 20) for reporting on significant non-finan-
cial performance indicators form the basis of this Annual Report.

We are convinced that the long-term success of the company can only be achieved when economic,
social and ecological aspects are harmonized. As part of our sustainability strategy, we focus on issues

which provide useful stimulus for the success of our company and, equally, for the positive development
of society as a whole.

Bilfinger is a member of the UN Global Compact and follows the rules of the German Corporate
Governance Code and the German Sustainability Code. We participate in the CDP surveys on emission
data, climate strategies and the responsible handling of environmental risks as well as in the assess-
ment procedures for sustainability indices including the RobecoSAM Assessment for the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index.

B.2.7.1 Occupational health and safety
Occupational safety The health of all employees is the number one priority for Bilfinger. Our Group-
wide management system for health, safety, environment and quality is centrally managed, developed
and is certified in accordance with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and SCC. A strong training
system serves the further education of employees in the operational areas. A central reporting sys-
tem summarizes reports from the Group units in quarterly reports to the Executive Board. For serious
work-related accidents, corrective measures to minimize risks are defined in the Executive Board and
maintained.
Responsibility for compliance with our occupational safety standards lies with the divisions and
operating units and the employees entrusted with this function there report to Corporate HSEQ. The
specific working conditions are taken into consideration in the implementation of Group standards a
the operating level.
The effectiveness of our systems for occupational safety in the operating units is verified by certifi-
cations in accordance with the standards OHSAS 18001 and SCC which cover around 60 percent of al
the Group’s operating units in the Industrial business segment. We conduct audits on all levels through
internal and external agencies in order to analyze and improve our occupational safety measures.
Accidents can only be prevented if employees are repeatedly made aware of the importance o
occupational safety. In order to further strengthen the safety culture at Bilfinger, we have successfully
established the SafetyWorks! program which lays out a methodical approach for continuous optimi-
zation for all units in our decentralized Group. We have been determining the accident ratio LTIF (Los
Time Injury Frequency: the number of work-related accidents resulting in at least one day of lost time as
relates to one million working hours) Group wide since 2009, we describe current developments based
on the evaluation of the data collected in our annual sustainability report.

Health protection Our concept for the promotion of health and performance among our employees
consists mainly of the areas sport and exercise, physical and psychological health as well as the opti-
mization of workplace conditions.

Through a framework agreement with a national fitness and wellness provider, our employees have
the opportunity to train and relax at fitness studios and sports facilities throughout Germany and Austria
at reasonable conditions.

We offer seminars, lectures and health days to help our employees deal with stress and maintain
their health and performance. We also regularly review workplaces of both administrative and industrial
employees to determine how they can optimized in terms of health.

B.2.7.2 Customer satisfaction and quality
The satisfaction of our customers is absolutely vital to us. We therefore consistently gear our service
range to their needs. We consider the quality of our services as a key factor in this regard. We ensure
the high standard of quality through a comprehensive quality management system. It starts with the
operating units, which are responsible for the quality of their products and services and monitor these
systematically. They are supported by the quality management of the divisions as well as by Corporate
HSEQ. System requirements and internal audits along with comprehensive training and education meas-
ures for quality assurance ensure that our high standards of quality are safeguarded and continuously
developed.

In around 70 percent of the company units in Bilfinger’s Industrial business segment there are man-
agement systems that have been certified in accordance with DIN EN ISO 9001 and the implementation
of these systems includes a regular survey of customer satisfaction. Since 2015, Bilfinger has also
had a cross-divisional matrix certificate in accordance with the most common international quality,
environmental and safety standards (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, SCCp and SCP). This will be
expanded in the medium term.

Our objective in the coming years is to be able to collect comparable data throughout the Group on
customer satisfaction, to make this data transparent and to report on it. To this end, we developed a
standardized method for customer satisfaction analysis in the reporting year and will roll it out in 2017.

a broad range of communication and training measures that are targeted toward all Bilfinger employees
and available in the 13 most important languages.

Corporate Legal & Compliance

To make the exchange of information and ideas between Corporate Compliance and Corporate Legal &
nsurance, the two departments were merged in the summer of 2016 into a new department (Corporate
Legal & Compliance) — with a direct reporting line to the Chairman of the Executive Board. Furthermore,
he responsibilities of this department were expanded as of January 1, 2017 to include investigations
and Allegation Management as an own office within the department. At the same time, cooperation
between the Compliance area and Internal Audit was intensified and formalized. We have thus ensured
hat the three areas that are fundamental to our compliance program — prevention of compliance vio-
ations, early recognition of misconduct as well as quick and consistent reactions to such misconduct
—are comprehensively managed by and within the area of responsibility of these gatekeeper functions.

Compliance Review Board
To sustainably anchor compliance as a management topic in all business units and departments, we also
decided to establish a Compliance Review Board (CRB) which convened for the first time on October
26, 2016. The CRB is comprised of the entire Executive Board as well as the heads of the corporate
departments and meets at least quarterly under the chairmanship of the Head of Legal & Compliance /
Chief Compliance Officer. In 2016, the CRB met twice. In addition, over the course of the reporting year,
the Chief Compliance Officer reported — at least formally in meetings — eight times to the Executive
Board and eleven times to the Supervisory Board or its Audit Committee on compliance-related issues.
As a result of the regular situation-related information and integration of Bilfinger’s supervisory and
management committees in important activities and strategic measures in the area of compliance, we
ensure that they are ideally equipped to meet their responsibilities in this area.

Manager integrity
In order to take the particular responsibility of managers into account, a new process was introduced
which, under the Head of Corporate Human Resources, evaluates the integrity of the most senior man-
agers as well as other risk functions. The process is applied to both the current office holders with man-
agement responsibility (management levels 1 and 2) and in the case of both new hires and promotions.
In addition, variable remuneration for managers (management level 1) was expanded in 2016 to include
an integrity factor which will be calculated for the first time in 2017. This metric will be defined by the

In addition, the integration of the Bilfinger Compliance Program and its further development in the busi-
ness processes is reviewed in order to ensure the efficiency of the program and the associated meas-
ures. The Internal Audit department verifies, among other things, the implementation of compliance
guidelines as part of so-called anti-corruption audits on site at the individual business units. In these
audits, the integrity of the business unit's payment transactions is also analyzed on the basis of mass
data analyses. In the period from April to December 2016, a total of eleven such audits were conducted
throughout the world. The results are made available to the Executive Board and the Chief Compliance
Officer in the form of relevant audit reports so that — where necessary — improvement measures can be
implemented.

Compliance requirements for business partners

Bilfinger relies on the cooperation with business partners throughout the world for the provision of our
services. Compliant behavior on the part of our business partners is an indispensable requirement for
building trust. Following the registration and risk classification of our business partners, the existing
process to evaluate their integrity was comprehensively revised and adjusted in a risk-oriented manner
over the course of the reporting year. In such an integrity audit, the business units or their purchasing
departments are supported by the Compliance department in the risk evaluation. The objective is to be
able to form a conclusive opinion through relevant advance explanations with regard to the extent to
which an existing or new business partner meets our integrity requirements (Integrity Due Diligence).

Bilfinger Compliance Remediation Program
In the year under review, we also launched a Group-wide project (Bilfinger Compliance Remediation Pro-
gram) to adapt the Bilfinger Compliance Program to the increasing regulatory requirements and to thus
gain a long term competitive advantage on the market. The objective is, on the one hand, to increase
awareness for compliance risks and how to deal with such risks among employees at all levels and, on
the other hand, to create the conditions that will allow integrity to be understood and experienced as a
component of the corporate culture.
The Bilfinger Compliance Remediation Program is divided into twelve work packages, each with
specific objectives and a comprehensive set of measures that are aligned with the objectives of effec-
tive corruption prevention agreed with the US authorities. Implementation of the Bilfinger Compliance
Remediation Program and the effectiveness of the revised Bilfinger Compliance Program are reviewed
by an independent monitor. As a result of the close integration of our corporate departments and busi-

ness units in the implementation of the Bilfinger Compliance Remediation Program we ensure that
Bilfinger meets the goals that have been set in a timely manner.

Compliance Help-Desk
Beyond the compliance-related measures within the context of the Bilfinger Compliance Program, it is

necessary that each manager and each employee is aware of his or her own personal responsibility and
that everyone behaves correctly at all times. So that each decision maker, in addition to his or her super-
visor or another contact person at the site, can receive further support in the execution of their respon-
sibilities, Bilfinger has established the co-called Compliance Help Desk as a central point of contact.

The Help Desk has been available to all employees since July 2016 and offers rapid and competent
support. We thus achieve uniformity and security in the handling of compliance issues and can provide
our compliance expertise globally to all employees by means of a structured approach. At the same
time, approaches for further improvement of our Bilfinger Compliance Program can result from the ques-
tions and feedback.

In the reporting year, we further expanded the compliance training program that has been in place since
2011 through broader offerings related to dealing with bribery and corruption training. The uniformly or-
ganized training modules take into account both on-site trainings and so-called e-learnings to maximize
the range of our training measures. We convey not only knowledge but also use practical case studies
to increase the participants’ awareness of compliance topics in a way that corresponds to their tasks
and positions.

We also provide comprehensive information on our compliance initiatives in our internal media and

With this range of compliance measures, we will further develop and improve our Bilfinger Compliance
Program, thus putting us in a position to effectively counter the compliance risks that exist for every
company.

Customers and business partners judge us based on how we run our business. Only if we ensure
that everyone in the company acts with integrity can we successfully assert ourselves in competition.
Bilfinger therefore understands the topic of compliance and the tasks associated with it as an en-

2016 2015

Material costs (€ million) 1,779 1,832
thereof services purchased 46% 55%
thereof raw material and supplies 54% 45%

Share of material costs in cost of sales 46% 40%

Purchasing was of key strategic importance for Bilfinger in financial year 2016 with material costs of
£1,779 million (previous year: €1,832 million) — this corresponds to a 46 percent share of cost of sales.
46 percent of the costs were accounted for by services purchased and 54 percent by raw materials and
supplies.

Due to the sale of parts of the company, in particular the sale of the Building, Facility Services
and Real Estate divisions, there was a change in purchased services and materials in 2016. Primarily
affected by this change were commodity groups such as technical building equipment and trade related
products and services in the construction industry.

For the purchase of subcontractor services, materials and services, we have a broad basis of inter-
nal and external suppliers as well as a number of procurement markets available. There is no general
dependence on individual business partners.

The Group Guideline on Procurement forms the basis of all procurement activities at Bilfinger. The
uniform procurement processes defined in the guideline are the foundation for the selection of suppli-

nour Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Subcontractors and Service Providers we express clear expec-

Global Compact initiative. Core elements of the Code of Conduct also relate to counteracting corruption,
bid rigging and illegal employment practices as well as respecting the fundamental rights of employees
and environmental protection requirements. We also unequivocally demand that our suppliers require
heir own suppliers to adhere to these principles.

B.2.7.5 Innovation (research and development report)
Research and development activities make a key contribution to the competitiveness of the Bilfinger
Group. The focus in this regard is on the market-oriented development of our engineering and service
range. The operating units are responsible for the development work. They are well-acquainted with the
needs of their customers and can drive innovations forward in a targeted manner. This results in techni-
cally sophisticated and economically feasible solutions that provide an immediate customer benefit. We
also enter into cooperations with leading universities and research institutes.

In the reporting year, Bilfinger pursued research and development projects with a total expense of
€7.4 million from continuing operations of the Group. The focus of these activities was on innovative

products and services as well as process innovations in the areas energy, industry and environment.

We develop the skills and experience of our employees, support their performance and make no com-
promises when it comes to integrity and occupational safety. In 2016, we focused primarily on the im-
plementation of far-reaching measures in the areas of leadership, compliance and project management.

The human resources program DRIVE, which was initiated in 2016, is targeted toward supporting
our employees in the Group’s current transformation phase. In twelve sub-projects, personnel standards
were defined and the transparency of internal development opportunities was expanded. At the same
time, projects were started to improve core processes and systems and thereby further increase com-
petitiveness.

Surveys and rankings attest to our excellent image as an attractive employer we enjoy among stu-
dents and professionals. We want to improve even further in order to ensure we are successful in the
competition for the best talent. The recruitment and personnel deployment planning of industrial staff
and specialists is becoming increasingly important. A more intensified local approach was taken in this
regard.
We established our Group Standard for the onboarding of employees in the reporting period. Around

the world, this supports new employees and those moving to other positions, particularly in terms of in-

ternalizing applicable rules for legally compliant behavior. We continued a comprehensive qualification
program that clarifies the Group-wide standards for compliance and to promote the awareness of the
observance of clear rules among all employees of the Group.
The Bilfinger Academy's range of training makes needs-oriented components available for profes-
sional training and targeted development of employees and managers. All business areas bring together

their seminars, e-learnings and development offers under a joint virtual umbrella. This gives employees
and managers a complete overview of all training events.

Annual staff appraisals ensure the dialog between managers and employees. In addition, they cre-
ate the conditions for selecting the respectively appropriate training and development measures from
the extensive offerings from the Bilfinger Academy. In 2016, we successfully established an internation-
ally valid standard for employee appraisals and measures to improve the culture of feedback.

In management development, specific development programs for each management level make
an important contribution to strengthening the performance and leadership competence of selected
managers and to increasing their loyalty to the company. An international ‘Talent Program’ was added in
2016 for defined areas to support future managers at an early stage in their personal and professional
development and to strengthen competences that are critical for success.

B.2.7.7 Equal opportunity and diversity
At Bilfinger, employees around the world are offered equal opportunities. There can be no discrimination
based on ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ideology, disability or age.

At the end of the reporting year, the share of women in the workforce was 10.1 percent worldwide
(previous year: 10.4 percent).

in 2016. It is an important issue for us to further increase this share; for this purpose we have been
executing a specific support program since 2011.

The differentiation of the management levels is undertaken on the basis of sales responsibility and the
importance of the area of responsibility that is managed.

B.2.7.8 Resource management and energy consumption
We want to reduce the negative environmental impact of our business activities and expand our sustain-
ability requirements along the value chain.
One of our most important objectives is the careful and intelligent handling of energy: the reduction
of CO. emissions, which we monitor on the basis of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol in the categories
Scope 1-3, is important for us. At all levels of the Group there are initiatives to reduce energy consump-
ion and COz emissions, for example through the use of low-emission vehicles and the recommendation
hat rail travel be used for business trips.

About 50 percent of the business units in the Industrial segment are certified in accordance with
he environmental management standard DIN EN ISO 14001 or the energy management standard DIN
EN ISO 50001.

We place great importance on waste and resource management and therefore take ecological cri-
eria into consideration already in the procurement of materials. We pay close attention to local avail-
ability and try to reuse unavoidable waste or to initiate a recycling or disposal procedure. We have
been undertaking a central collection of data related to dangerous waste since 2012, whereby not all
ocations have been integrated yet. In the years to come, we will gradually expand the scope of key
environmentally-relevant key performance indicators.

B.3 Risk and opportunity report

The recognition of risks and opportunities is an integral part of the process management system at our
operational units. We define opportunities as favorable deviations and risks as negative deviations from

planned framework cond

itions.

Against a backdrop of strategic corporate planning approved by the Executive Board, detailed five-
year planning is being developed. In order to regularly check the achievement of targets, identify trends
and subsequently identify possible deviations, the Executive Board regularly conducts business reviews
together with the divisional management in which business development is discussed together with
short and medium-term earnings expectations of the divisions and measures to prevent risks and take

advantage of opportuniti

es. This

ion, including markets, competitive situation, strategic positioning as

or the reduction of risks in the Group.

early stage, evaluating tl
suitable measures. Oppo

are not recorded in our risk management system; they are evaluated

Our risk management system is continuously revised and improved. The goal that is pursued is

therefore to apply suitab

e measures to reduce the risks to an acceptable level. The risk tolerance that

arises is therefore proportional to the earnings opportunities that are identified. In accordance with the

Group Principles on risk awareness, Bilfinger only assumes manageable risks.

In order to further develop the risk-management system, the Executive Board initiated a program for
the re-design of the existing risk management system elements in 2015. In the first stage, a financial
risk assessment was carried out for the period 03/2015 to 01/2016 with the aim of identifying and
evaluating financial risks. The risk assessment and evaluation was carried out through a top-down
assessment with the members of the Executive Board, heads of financial corporate departments as well
as divisional management and a bottom-up assessment in a representative selection of companies for

picions of breaches of criminal law or of our principles of conduct. The protection of whistleblowers
is binding. The processing of the received information regarding suspected misconduct is investigat-
ed independently and led by Corporate Internal Audit & Controls. In order to increase transparency,
we regularly inform managers of all significant reported information on suspected misconduct in an
anonymous form. If required, processes can be changed or optimized using the case analysis in order
to prevent damage in future.

All new employees must complete web-based training on the Bilfinger principles of conduct.
We also offer comprehensive training on corruption prevention worldwide. Furthermore, the top
managers of the company take part in targeted anti-corruption workshops. These trainings undergo
continuous development.

As part of the ongoing development of the risk management system and as a component of the
compliance management system, a compliance risk assessment was conducted in all Group com-
panies in financial year 2016. The operational implementation and the specification of the meth-
odology followed in blocks from May 2016. In this regard, compliance risks were initially identified
and evaluated from a Group-wide top-down perspective and subsequently placed in relation to a
company-related bottom-up compliance risk assessment.

This year's focus of the compliance risk assessment was on corruption risks, giving special con-
sideration to risks in the areas of granting undue advantage, office-holder liability as well as bribery
and corruptibility in business transactions.

The evaluation of the risks identified within the scope of scenario-based assessment interviews
was conducted parallel to the other operational areas of the risk management system through the
parameters probability of occurrence and impact. This evaluation was conducted both without con-
sideration of mitigation measures (gross) as well as after acknowledgment of the respective mitiga-
tion impact (net). The objective of the compliance risk assessment is a derivation of the compliance
risk situation for each company as well as the compliance risk portfolio for business segments and
the Group.

The results of the respective Compliance risk assessments were coordinated with the Executive
Managements as well as with Corporate Legal and Compliance and with Corporate Internal Audit &
Controls in the interests of an integrated Corporate Governance system approach. The results of the
compliance risks aggregated or consolidated within this framework will in future aid the Executive
Board with the management and monitoring of the company.

= The IT systems used in accounting are protected from unauthorized access through appropriate
security measures.

= Uniform accounting is defined in Group-wide guidelines, which are regularly updated.

= Accounting data is randomly reviewed for completeness and accuracy on a regular basis. Pro-
grammed plausibility audits are carried out by software that is designed for that purpose.

= Appropriate controls have been implemented for all accounting relevant processes (including the
dual control principle, functional separation and analytical audits). They are also reviewed regularly
by Corporate Internal Audit & Controls.

= On the basis of the reports received from the external auditors and from Corporate Internal Audit
& Controls, the Supervisory Board, through its Audit Committee, reviews the functionality of the
internal control and risk-management system as relates to the accounting process.

Within the scope of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the accounting and
consolidation process, Bilfinger has taken the measures described above for the identification and eval-
uation of risks that could counter the objective of conformity with standards in the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the combined management report (especially inaccuracies, violations of standards
and requirements, manipulation, data collection and security, elimination of existing internal controls,
inaccurate assessments of situations, inappropriate exercise of organization and assessment latitude
as well as inaccurate estimates and evaluations). These relate primarily to systematic and manual coor-
dination processes at Group, divisional and company level.

To limit the identified risks that exist with regard to the Group accounting processes, Bilfinger,
within the scope of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the accounting
and consolidation process, has taken the measures described above, primarily the establishment of the
internal control system, the requirement of a conceptual framework and the establishment of quality
assuring control and monitoring mechanisms.

B.3.2 Risks
B.3.2.1 Significant risks
The following risks could lead to significant negative impacts on our net assets and financial position
as well as on our reputation. The risks are presented on a gross basis before risk limitation measures.
Unless otherwise stated, the risks presented in this chapter affect the entire Group. Risks specific
to business segments include an appropriate indication. The principles of the reporting structure that
is valid from 2017 with the business segments Engineering & Technologies as well as Maintenance,
Modifications & Operations are described in chapter B.4 Outlook.
In our risk categories ‘Risks related to our business environment’, ‘Risks related to service provision’,
‘Financial risks’ and ‘Other risks’, we have identified the following risks as the greatest challenges for
Bilfinger:

Risks related to our business environment — market risks The development of the crude oil price
could severely impact our business. Furthermore, the negative development of the energy markets in
Europe could negatively affect the business of individual areas of our company. Both factors could lead
to our customers reducing their investment and maintenance budgets. In addition, competition could
continue to increase. This could result in risks for the net assets and financial position of our Group.

Other risks — compliance risks In connection with the Deferred Prosecution Agreement to preven
legal proceedings against Bilfinger, which was concluded with the United States, there is a danger tha
the suspended legal proceedings against Bilfinger reach the point of prosecution or that the duration o
observation by the Compliance Monitor is extended. The resulting costs could have a significant impac
on the financial position of Bilfinger. In addition, there are also reputation risks which, if they were to
materialize, would noticeably affect our competitive position.

Other risks — risks from legal disputes The outcome of legal disputes often depends on inquiry or
assessments on the part of the courts and can therefore not be predicted with certainty. The possibility
that the outcomes of litigation and proceedings may deviate from our assessments and forecasts and
that our net assets and financial position may be affected can thus not be ruled out. The most significant
current legal dispute relates to the collection of evidence in connection with the collapse of the Cologne
municipal archives in 2009.

The order of the risks presented within the individual risk categories reflects the importance for Bilfinger.

B.3.2.2 Risks related to our business environment
Bilfinger depends on the general economic situation and the development of its markets. We are also
exposed to political and macroeconomic risks. There is a tremendous amount of competition in our
markets. Changes in legal requirements could also burden our earnings. To manage these risks, we reg-
ularly analyze how countries’ economies and legal framework conditions are developing and continually
evaluate our competitiveness in our markets.

Energy policy

As a consequence of the changes to the German energy policy, there is still a lack of planning security
for power plant operators. The investment backlog that began with the energy transformation has con-
tinued. This is on top of increasing savings in the maintenance budgets. In other European countries,
too, the energy transformation is having a negative effect on investment behavior.

A reduction of orders received beyond the predictable decline could have further negative effects on
our results of operations, net assets and financial position. This requires an organizational and strategic
reorganization of our activities in this business. The main principles of the measures taken are described
in the chapter B.4 Outlook.

Countries
Country risks include uncertainties arising from political developments in our markets. In order to mini-
mize such risks, we operate only in certain specified markets. In the course of the strategic repositioning
of the company, we place the focus of our business on the core markets of Europe and, increasingly, on
the United States and the Middle East.
In several Middle Eastern countries there are increased risks from the political situation. On top of
this, there are possibly also compliance and financial risks there. To make business there legally secure
and to transact this business under consideration of our compliance rules, central audit steps were
introduced by the Executive Board. An internal export control reviews and organizes the permissibility
of export transactions from a customs and trade perspective throughout the Group. In addition, possible
violations of international sanctions should be ruled out. The minimum requirements with regard to our
compliance regulations were also added to cover particular risks in individual countries.

Climate change and environment
Risks related to climate change and regulatory countermeasures affect Bilfinger primarily as a conse-
quence of regulations and standards for product and process efficiency. At the same time, requirements
for the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions are increasing around the world as a result
of business activities. Contamination of air and water can occur through our production processes at
production facilities and at construction sites as well as in transport. Failure to comply with environmen-
tal standards can have substantial risks for the habitats affected, for the company it can be associated
with reputational risks and high cost risks.

On the customer side, new or changed environmental legislation and regulations lead to significant
cost increases, particularly for our European customers in the energy-intensive process industry. This
could result in our customers making savings, thereby decreased demand for our products and services
and thus an impact on our results of operations, net assets and financial position.

The direct consequences of climate change such as extremely strong rainfall or the lack of precipita-
tion, unusually high or low temperatures could have a negative impact on our service provision, because
services are primarily conducted outdoors.

The business units have management systems to measure and reduce the impact of our business
activities on the environment. These are partially subject to various national, industry, and customer
specific requirements. Further explanations on the handling of environmental risks are included in the
chapter B.2.7.8 Resource management and energy consumption as well as in the Bilfinger Sustainabil-
ity Report which will be published in May 2017.

B.3.2.3 Risks related to service provision

Occupational safety and quality

As a service provider, we are almost exclusively active at the locations of our customers. In the execu-
tion of our work we place the highest possible demands on safety, environmental protection and quality
of our services and have anchored the goal of ‘zero accidents’ in our safety culture. At the same time,
we strictly maintain the safety requirements of our customers, though it is still not possible to prevent
all incidents.

Our customers have strict requirements for health, safety and environment as well as for the quality
the services provided. Failure in these areas could lead to adverse effects on our customer relation-
hips through to loss of orders as well as contractual penalties and damage claims and could thus have
negative impact on the net assets and financial position of the Group.

We counteract risks from quality defects with our quality and process management. It starts with the
perating units, which are responsible for the process as well as the quality of their services. Through
system requirements and targets and internal audits, they work toward the continued development of
quality standards. Our processes and units are also externally audited and certified.

Service business
Risks from the service business following the strategic repositioning in 2017 relate primarily to the
aintenance, Modifications & Operations business segment. Here, we generally conclude contracts
over a longer term, which are primarily awarded in a highly competitive environment. The earnings mar-
gins attainable in long-term contracts could deviate from the initial calculations as a result of changes
rom diverse influences. In maintaining industrial plants and buildings, there is the risk that material and
personnel costs or legal requirements are not fully covered by the contractual revenue and thus have an
impact on the financial position.
Overall, the calculation and execution risks in the service business are, however, generally lower
han in the project business due to the lesser degree of complexity and lower order volumes. In terms of
he risk profile of Bilfinger, we therefore focus our activities on the service business.
he basis for the management of risks in the service sector is a profound understanding of the
customer, the services being provided and of the contract conditions that have been agreed. For the
execution of the work, our operative companies have competent, reliable and experienced staff. In view
of the high degree of involvement in the business processes of our customers, we pay particular atten-
tion to the appropriate level of qualification of the persons assigned. Precise knowledge of the specific
conditions in the plants we manage is a decisive factor for our business success. Service contracts
above a certain volume must be subject to a regular review by Corporate Project Controlling over the
contract period.

Overcapacities

Against the backdrop of demand development in sub-markets of our industrial service business, we are
faced with risks resulting from overcapacities and reduced cost flexibility. Fluctuations in demand could
continue to have a noticeable impact on the financial position.

We are therefore developing measures to adapt administrative capacities and reduce over-capacity.
We consistently adapt these structures to the requirements of the restructured operating business.
We also continuously work on gaining a greater degree of flexibility in our operating costs. In addition
to measures for greater flexibility in the availability of our own staff, we also constantly examine the
vertical integration within the scope of structured ‘make or buy’ decisions as regards the appointment
of our own employees or the use of subcontractors.

Technical characteristics

In some of the contracts with our customers, technical parameters and availability of the plant must be
assured and guaranteed through penalties. If the technical values or availability are not achieved, there
is the risk of significant costs of rectification, the payment of technical penalties or withdrawal of the
customer in the case of obligation for payment of damages.

Human resources

Bilfinger is currently in a far-reaching transformation process. The strategic repositioning of the com-
pany and the necessary optimization of the organizational structures are of course associated with
uncertainty for employees. The organizational and strategic repositioning, however, have again led to
an increase in employees’ confidence in the company. There is, however, a continued risk that qualified
staff will leave the company and potential new employees will be reluctant to move to Bilfinger. Be-
cause the company is reliant on technically qualified and motivated employees in many areas in order
to be able to meet the requirements of its customers, this could have a negative impact on customer
satisfaction. If this affects the regular business and order acquisition, negative effects on the net assets
and financial position are possible.

As part of our human resources controlling, we closely follow structural changes within the work-
force and can thus counteract any negative developments at an early stage. We counter attempts by
competitors to recruit our employees with attractive wage and salary structures and a targeted identi-
fication of personal development prospects. Overall, we counter human resources risks that could arise
from a lack of young talent, fluctuation, a lack of qualifications, limited motivation or an aging of the
workforce with a broad range of measures that are described in chapter B.2.7.6 Employee development.

Procurement, supply chain and human rights
With a volume of about €1.8 billion, purchasing is a decisive factor in our business success. In addition
to the economic aspects, respect for human rights is also extremely important in our supply chain.
As a longstanding member of the United Nations Global Compact, we are committed to supporting
the protection of human rights within our area of influence. Failure to observe basic rights leads to
significant risks for the personal, social and economic situation of those affected. For our company,
this could lead not only to significant reputation risks, but also to negative impacts on the company’s
economic performance and earnings situation. Therefore, all suppliers are bound by the principles of
our Group-wide procurement guideline to meet minimum requirements with regard to the observance
of human righ
As aresult of the sale of parts of the company, in particular the sale of the Building, Facility Services
and Real Estate divisions in 2016, the purchasing volumes of the Group decreased significantly. Primar-
ily affected by this decline, however, were commodity groups such as technical building equipment and
rade related products and services in the construction industry. With regard to the remaining purchas-
ing volume, there are primarily risks from price increases in the indirect materials costs. In addition,
preliminary work from our suppliers, subcontractors or service providers that is lacking, too expensive
or inadequate in terms of quality could have significant negative impacts on our financial position.
Unexpected price increases in components, energy and raw materials could also be a burdening factor.
The handling of these procurement risks is a key component of our supplier management system, the
principles of which are described in chapter B.2.7.4 Procurement and supply chain.

We intensively monitor our global procurement markets. The Group-wide monitoring of world mar-
et prices of, for example, steel, oil and services facilitates the flexible procurement of materials and
subcontractor services for our projects at optimal conditions. We counteract regional procurement risks
by cooperating with competitive suppliers and subcontractors. We secure quantities, qualities and pric-
es by means of letters of intent and preliminary agreements. We also safeguard ourselves against
inflation by means of sliding-price clauses in our offers as far as this is permitted and the competitive
position allows this.

Business partners
For the execution of our business activities we maintain diverse contractual relationships with a large
number of partners. For the most part, these are clients, partners in jointly-owned companies, consorti-
ums and joint ventures, subcontractors, suppliers, financial institutions, insurers as well as service pro-
viders. If these contract partners are not able to meet their performance and / or payment obligations,
if they perform poorly, behind schedule or not at all, this can impact our liquidity and financial situation.

We counter these risks by carefully selecting our partners in terms of reliability and performance,
a consistent dunning system and — when necessary — a collateralization of their contractual obliga-
tions. In the execution of projects with consortial and joint venture partners and in the assignment of
important subcontractors, all potential breakdowns on the partner side are routinely included in the bid
considerations. Where possible, we pursue a ‘multi-sourcing’ strategy in order to be able to draw on
alternatives quickly in the case of a loss of a partner, particularly suppliers, and thereby avoid a potential
performance failure. Within the scope of the monthly debtor reporting, receivables with our customers
are brought together and evaluated in terms of the respective probability of default based on the exter-
nal rating. In order to minimize cluster risks, volume-graded limits are defined at Group level in relation
0 the external customer rating.

We subject important suppliers, service providers, subcontractors, working groups, consortia and
joint ventures as well as all distribution agents to an integrity review before contract signing.
A particular problem is presented by advance performance obligations, which affect some areas
of our business. Inherent to these obligations is the risk that payments from the client are not made
on time or that additional work must be carried out that has not been secured with a price agreement.
This could result in risks for the calculated earnings of an order. In order to avoid such risks, we follow
he systematic payment behavior, business conduct and the financial situation of the customer and try,
particularly within the project area, to meet security requirements.

B.3.2.4 Financial risks

We are also subject to financial risks in the form of liquidity and financing risks, market price risks from
he fluctuation in currency and commodity prices and changes in interest rates as well as credit risks of
our banking partners. We monitor these financial risks with proven control mechanisms that allow for
imely and transparent reporting. The Group's reporting system guarantees the regular identification,
analysis, assessment and management of financial risks by Corporate Treasury. All relevant equity in-
erests and joint ventures are included in this monitoring.

Fundamental questions of risk management such as defining or reviewing methods, limits or risk
strategies are dealt with by a steering committee with the direct involvement of the Executive Board.

As a result of an unexpected negative business development, increased financing needs can occur
in the operating units. At the same time, a negative business development can lead to changes in Bil-
finger’s credit rating, particularly through rating agencies and banks, which could lead to more difficult
and more expensive financing, or make securing bonds and guarantees more difficult and expensive.
External financing can also result in a worsening of the dynamic gearing ratio. Within the scope of the
agreed financial covenant, it is ensured that this gearing ratio is met. Any breach of the financial cove-
nant can lead directly or, through cross-default clauses, indirectly to the repayment call of all financing
on a recourse basis and can thereby also lead to an unplanned loss of liquidity.

We counter this risk by centrally monitoring liquidity development and risks in the Group using a
rolling cash flow planning and introducing countermeasures at an early stage. Within the context of
central financing, Bilfinger SE makes necessary liquidity available to its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
economically less relevant regions, the Group's internal equalization of liquidity in Europe and in the
USA is supported by cross-border cash pooling.
nvestment financing is carried out with consideration of matching maturities. In 2012, a €500 mil-
lion bond with maturity in 2019 was issued with a fixed interest rate over the entire period. To finance
working capital, we have a €300 million pre-approved credit line at attractive conditions that is in place
until June 2018. This includes a standard market financial covenant in the form of a limitation of the
dynamic gearing ratio net debt / EBITDA. The value as of December 31, 2016 is substantially below the
contractually agreed cap. If, in the case of a significant worsening, adjustment does not take place in
agreement with the lender, any breach of the financial covenant can lead directly or, through cross-de-
ault clauses, indirectly to the repayment call of all financing on a recourse basis.

The sureties available for the execution of our project and services business with a volume of about
€1.7 billion are sufficiently dimensioned to accompany the further development of the company. In addi-
ion, we have a US surety program in the amount of USD 700 million for the execution of our business in

orth America. All credit commitments can be called due prematurely in the case of a change of control.

Market-price risks in the financial sector primarily involve exchange rates, interest rates, raw-mate-
rial prices and the market values of financial investments. As a globally active company, we are subject

W Geb titemel iiorciten risks in consideration of future needs for new financing or refinancing on the basis of a cash-flow-at-risk
model. The borrowing costs budgeted within the scope of the cost of-capital model serve as a point of
reference. To manage this, we generally apply derivative financial instruments such as interest-rate
swaps and swaptions.
Positive market values and the investment of liquid funds in banks result in credit risks from these
banks. In the case of a collapse of the bank, there is the risk of a loss, which can have a negative impact
on our net assets and financial position. We counter these risks by concluding relevant financial trans-
actions with such banks that have a public short-term rating of at least A. In addition, on the basis of an

internal limit system, a diversification of volumes and maturities takes place.

Compliance

The importance of compliance risks for Bilfinger remains high. We investigate suspicious cases in vari-
ous countries and are cooperating with the responsible authorities.

With regard to the case in the USA for viola

it was agreed in 2016 with the American Department of Justice (DoJ) that the Deferred Prosecution

Agreement (DPA) that has been in place since 20

3 would be extended until the end of 2018. The key

We are currently investigating suspicious cases in various countries, including Brazil and Vietnam,

significant disgorgement of profits or other liability claims in connection with these transactions.

Changes to the regulatory environment in mar!

kets where we do business could affect our business

globally and impact our business situation, net assets and financial position. Bilfinger could also face
fines, sanctions and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, uncertainty in the legal environment could
mean that we are subject to increasing costs for adequate compliance programs. In 2016, in connection
with the further development and re-design of our compliance program, we had expenditures in the

amount of approximately €20 million.

Corruption, antitrust or similar proceedings against Bilfinger could lead to criminal or civil pros-
ecution as well as fines, sanctions, injunctions, disgorgement of profits, the exclusion from direct or
indirect participation in certain business activities or to other restrictions. In addition, corruption and
antitrust cases or other misconduct could have a detrimental effect on our involvement in business with
public-sector customers — up to exclusion from public-sector contracts. Criminal prosecution could also
result in the cancellation of some of our existing contracts and third parties, including competitors, could
initiate proceedings against us on a large scale.

Legal disputes; damage cases and liability risks
In addition to the costs and expenses that arise as a result of legal disputes, there is also the risk of fi-
nancial loss arising from correct, incorrect or lengthy decisions on the part of courts or public authorities.

Legal disputes predominantly arise from our provision of services. Controversies with customers
mainly relate to claimed defects in our services, delays to completion or to the scope of services provid-
ed. In such cases there is often also a similar dispute with the subcontractors that were used. We strive
to avoid legal disputes wherever possible or to settle them at an early stage. This goal cannot always be
achieved, however, with the result that German and international companies are sometimes involved in
litigation or arbitration. The outcome of such can of course not be predicted with any degree of certainty,
but is often dependent on inquiry or assessments on the part of the courts. We therefore cannot exclude
the possibility that the outcomes of litigation and proceedings may deviate from our assessments and
forecasts and that damages may occur to our net assets and financial position.

Among the most important current damage cases is the collection of evidence for the cause and
amount of potential claims in connection with the collapse of the Cologne municipal archives in 2009.
Bilfinger participates with a share of one third in the joint venture that was commissioned with the con-
struction of an underground rail line in front of the former location of the municipal archives. Gathering
of evidence in these proceedings has not been completed. From today’s perspective, we expect that in
case of a proportionate availment we would, if necessary have sufficient insurance coverage. Should
risks from this case occur, claims would be made against the owners of the commissioned joint venture
who are jointly and severally liable. There is no binding assessment of the potential magnitude of the
damages.

A suit has been filed against Bilfinger for arbitration proceedings by a customer in connection with
a plant project in Texas. The customer is claiming the costs of a replacement measure following termi-
nation of the works contract. The exact volume of the suit has not yet been determined but is likely to be
in the middle double-digit million US dollar range. We have filed a counter-suit for payment for our ser-
vices also in the mid-double digit million US dollar range. Another lawsuit in the United States relates to
the services of an American subsidiary. The customer's claim is an amount in the mid double-digit million

US dollar range, but here too there are substantial counter-claims.

In connection with a concluded M&A selling project, a

suit has been filed by the seller for arbitra-

tion proceedings in Germany. The seller has asserted a claim in the mid double-digit million euro range

against us.

In Malaysia, we have been sued for damages in the lower double-digit million range in connection
with a project that is currently in arbitration hearings. Proceedings are still at an early stage.

Damage cases in connection with the business activities of the Bilfinger Group, including those
outside of legal disputes, can have significant negative financial impacts for the affected Group com-
pany and for the Group. We generally transfer such risks to financially sound, international insurance

companies as part of insurance contracts. The key insura

nce contracts of the Group include diverse

liability insurances to protect against claims from third parties, technical insurances and property and

transport insurances.

Overall, following careful examinations, we can assume that sufficient provisions have been recog-
nized in the balance sheet for all ongoing disputes and partially with recourse claims. However, it is still
possible that the available provisions are insufficient as a result of the difficulty in making projections
or because capitalized receivables cannot be fully collected.

Restructuring
In the course of the restructuring of Bilfinger, we are also working closely on initiatives for cost re-
duction. This concerns both structural optimization of our organization as well as the adjustment of
capacities. If the necessary measures cannot be implemented as planned, their benefits are less than
originally estimated, they take effect later than expected or do not have any effect or the necessary one-
ime expenses and investments are higher than currently foreseeable, this would result in a negative
deviation from our planning. We continually control and monitor the processes of the strategic reposi-
ioning of Bilfinger and implement appropriate concepts for the management and controlling.

T
n 2016, we launched a comprehensive program for the standardization of the Group IT system land-
scape, which will help us to accelerate processes and to reduce complexity in our company. To achieve
his goal, we will make investments of millions of euros in the coming years. If these measures cannot
be implemented as planned, their benefits are less than originally estimated, they take effect later
han expected or the necessary investments are higher than currently foreseeable, this would lead to a
negative deviation from our planning.

Threats to information security could lead to risks to the security of our services, systems and net-
works. The confidentiality, availability and reliability of data could also be endangered through unau-
thorized access to our information technology. Furthermore, negative effects on our reputation, compet-
itiveness and business could occur.

In order to prevent unauthorized access and data loss and to guarantee the permanent availability of
our systems, we protect our information technology with numerous technical installations. Our IT struc-
tures are largely standardized. We use software products from leading producers such as SAP, Oracle
and Microsoft. Applicable security guidelines are continuously adapted to the latest technical develop-
ments. The IT security is regularly audited in a standardized process by internal and external auditors.

Risks from the sale of the Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions
(discontinued operations)

The selling price for the Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions, sold in the third quarter of
2016, of approximately €1.2 billion includes non-cash components that are to be paid when new owner
EQT resells the company, at the latest. On the one hand, Bilfinger grants the acquiring company a de-
erral of a portion of the purchase price in the amount of €100 million with annual interest of 10 percent
upon maturity. On the other hand, a further portion of the purchase price in the amount of €195 million
will be transformed into equity-like participation rights. This entitles Bilfinger to 49 percent of the resale
proceeds from EQT. We thus continue to participate in a proportionate amount in the development of the
sold divisions. If their value should develop worse than planned, up to and including a complete loss of
value, there is the risk of negative effects on Bilfinger’s results of operations, net assets and financial
position.

Disposals

Selling processes have been initiated for individual companies categorized as not strategically relevant
and, with the strategic repositioning in 2017, are presented under Other operations. Disposal plans
carry the risk that certain business activities cannot be sold as planned. In addition, completed disposals
could result in negative impacts on our results of operations, net assets and financial position.

In general, clearly predetermined processes and criteria are observed with disposals: In the first
stage a review is carried out to determine whether the disposal of a business unit is consistent with the
Group strategy or whether there are other considerations in favor of selling and what the framework
conditions for the sale of a business unit are. Particular consideration is given to whether there could be
a promising group of buyers and whether there are initially identifiable risks for the Group. Furthermore,
alternatives such as restructuring or closure, for example, are taken into account and examined.

Acquisitions

Company acquisitions can, as a result of the absence of expected economic success, lead to substantial
burdens for the Group including potential goodwill impairment. The causes for this could, for example,
be related to unexpected business or market developments, the appearance of unforeseen financial
obligations, inadequate integration or increased personnel fluctuation. Because we have not made any
large acquisitions in the reporting year and are not presently planning any, risks from acquisitions for
Bilfinger are currently low. It is however still possible that risks from earlier acquisitions occur, par-
ticularly as concerns possible impairments to goodwill (see the C.4 Notes to the consolidated financial
statements, Note 15 for the impairment tests of goodwill).

Subsidiaries
The subsidiaries are responsible for the operating business of the Bilfinger Group. This carries the risk
that misconduct occurring here is not promptly identified at the Group headquarters and countermeas-
ures against impending negative effects on our results of operations, net assets and financial position
are implemented too late.

All the companies of the Group are therefore subject to an ongoing financial controlling process.
Corporate Controlling reports to the Executive Board once a month and informs it of any unusual devel-
opments without delay. Corporate Controlling develops a complete picture and an independent opinion
on the financial situation of the companies. The following instruments and analyses are particularly
used:

= Monthly results forecasts for the year-end with a focus at a division level including documentation
or opportunities and risks

= Analysis of the loss-making units and cash-negative units
= Working capital analysis and documentation of changes to net working capital
= Analysis of the statement of cash flows with a focus at division level

In addition, there is a decentralized financial controlling department in each division that reports to the
respective divisional management and is subject to the functional supervision of Corporate Controlling.

B.3.4 Opportunities
We evaluate the opportunities for Bilfinger within the scope of our strategy process. The main fea-
tures of the strategic and organizational repositioning are described in chapter B.4 Outlook. We de-
fine opportunities as developments which deviate from this strategic planning in a positive way and
which, accordingly, could result in an additional improvement in our results of operations, net assets and
financial position.
The opportunities described below generally relate to the entire Group. Segment-specific opportu-
nities are declared as such. In terms of their order within the individual categories, the opportunities
presented reflect the current evaluation of their importance for Bilfinger.

B.3.4.1 Opportunities related to our business environment

Oil price development

A sustainable increase in global market prices for fossil fuels beyond the level that we assume in our
strategic planning would have additional positive effects on our business operations. An oil price that,
over a longer term, is above the profitability threshold of more cost intensive fracking technologies and
deep-sea production would revive the investing activities of our customers. This would primarily impact
the maintenance and investment budgets in the Norwegian and British oil and gas sector as well as the
US shale gas sector.

General economic conditions

Our strategic planning is based on certain assumptions with regard to the economic framework con-
ditions in our markets in Europe, the United States and the Middle East. If the actual development
deviates positively from this planning basis, it can lead to additional impetus on demand.

Exchange rates
Our planning is based on the assumption that the exchange rates for those currencies that are important
for Bilfinger — the US dollar, British pound and the Norwegian krone — will remain at the average level of

2016. Because the vast majority of our services are provided on site, we are less affected by changes in
currency exchange rates than companies that rely on the export of goods. Nevertheless, a more favora-
ble exchange rate development would mean additional positive effects for Bilfinger.

B.3.4.2 Other opportunities

Value development of the non-cash purchase price components for the sold
Building, Facility Services and Real Estate divisions (discontinued operations)

As described under Risks in chapter B.3.2.5 Other risks, the selling price for the Building, Facility
Services and Real Estate divisions sold in the third quarter of 2016 includes non-cash components
that are to be paid when new owner EOT resells the company, at the latest. This entitles Bilfinger to
49 percent of the resale proceeds from EQT. We thus continue to participate in a proportionate amount
in the development of the sold divisions. If their value should develop better than planned, at the time
of a resale there is an opportunity of positive effects on Bilfinger’s results of operations, net assets and
financial position.

B.3.5 General assessment of the opportunities situation

With the strategic and organizational repositioning, we create the conditions necessary for the success-
ful future of our company. Our environment and service range offer additional opportunities that can
lead to a development of our results of operations, net assets and financial performance that is above
our planning.

B.4 Outlook

B.4.1 Organizational and strategic repositioning
We repositioned the Bilfinger Group at the beginning of 2017. With our comprehensive range of services
for plants in the process industry, an organizational structure that is aligned with the needs of our cus-
tomers and a focus on defined customer industries, we have established the foundation for the success-
ful development of our company. The forecasts and statements related to the expected development of
Bilfinger are made within the scope of these new structures.

Two business segments

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS FROM JANUARY 1, 2017

Middle East industries

Northwest Europe

From financial year 2017, we report on Bilfinger’s business development in the two segments Engineer-
ing & Technologies and Maintenance, Modifications & Operations.

The Engineering & Technologies segment bundles activities based on engineering services and tech-
nical solutions. The project business is predominant, important drivers are capital expenditures on the
part of our customers (CAPEX). We meet the requirements of our customers by means of a centrally con-
trolled project management system in an internationally-active division focused on defined industries
and engineering disciplines.

In the Maintenance, Modifications & Operations segment, we report on our activities in ongoing
maintenance services, modifications and operational management of industrial plants. These activities
are dominated by the share of the services business that is based on long-term framework agreements.
The main drivers of the business are, in many cases, the budgets of our customers for the ongoing oper-
ation of their plants (operational expenditure — OPEX). Because these relate primarily to activities with
specific local demand structures, we have organized this business in regions.

Four regions

Bilfinger concentrates its business on the core regions Continental Europe, Northwest Europe, North
America and the Middle East. In these regions, we already have partially very good market positions and
see opportunities to expand our business in selected areas. We have carefully analyzed the respective
environments and evaluated our regional development potential in defined customer groups.

Six customer industries

Bilfinger has exceptional competences and particularly strong customer relationships in the industrial
sectors chemicals & petrochemicals, oil & gas as well as energy & utilities which account for the majori-
ty of our current output volume. In the pharma & biopharma, cement and metallurgy industries we intend
to further expand our existing business and grow to an even greater extent in future.

Other Operations

We report on operating units that are active outside the defined business segments, regions and cus-
tomer groups under Other Operations. These units are not the focus of the Group's new strategic posi-
tioning, but will be managed independently for value. In the long term, a suitable owner will be sought
for the individual units.

B.4.2_ General economic development

The outlook for 2017 from research institutes and international organizations with regard to the econo-
my in Europe, the USA and emerging countries is restrained. In these forecasts, the prospects for world
trade and capital investments in particular are shaped by substantial political uncertainties. The chance
that new comprehensive free trade zones could revive the recent stagnation in world trade has declined
with the expected failure of the transatlantic and transpacific free trade zones.

Chemicals & petrochemicals, pharma & biopharma

Important customer industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals are particularly impacted by the
risks of growing protectionism and new obstacles in the European single market. The United Kingdom,
which is heading toward an exit from the European Union, is currently Germany's third largest export
market. A departure of the country from the single market, which would bring with it new import du-
ties and other obstacles to trade, would have a substantial impact on certain industries. Currently,
10.5 percent of the German pharmaceuticals industry's exports go to the United Kingdom (DB Research).
Especially with regard to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, the industrial services sector
can thus not expect a sweeping revival of the business in Europe. In addition to the economic risks, there
are also additional dangers for the German market as a result of the planned tightening of regulations
regarding temporary employment and the law governing the sale of goods and services. New bureau-
cratic hurdles in this area represent an additional problem for the industrial services sector which relies
ona high degree of flexibility (Ltin, p. 36).

Our forecast takes into account the expected hesitation among our clients in the oil and gas busi-
ness both in terms of investments and in the maintenance budgets due to the continued uncertain out-
look for the price of oil. We also assume that there will be continued aggressive competitive behavior
as a result of the tight market and limited demand. This applies to all areas of the market within the
production chain, even at a local level we see few differences. In terms of the price of oil, our planning
for 2017 is based on a level of approximately US$ 50/bbI.

B.4.4 Expected business development in 2017

OUTLOOK 2017 Current situation Forecast

Financial year 2016 Financial year 2017
Output volume €4,219 million Organic decrease in the mid to high single digit percentage range
Adjusted EBITA €15 million Further margin improvement of about 100 basis points

Output volume Output volume for the Group (reporting year: €4,219 million) will decrease again in
2017, the organic decline is expected to be in the mid to high single digit percentage range.

In this regard, we anticipate a clearer reduction in output volume in the Engineering & Technologies
segment due to a selective acceptance of orders in the project business. In the Maintenance, Modifi-
cations & Operations segment, on the other hand, we expect a slight decrease. For Other Operations
— considering the sales of companies that have been carried out — a stable organic development is
anticipated.

Orders received for the Group will grow organically as compared to the reporting year. As of Decem-
ber 31, 2016, order backlog was €2,618 million. We expect that most of this amount will translate into
output volume in 2017.

Adjusted EBITA/ adjusted EBITA margin For adjusted EBITA (reporting year: €15 million) we expect
a significant increase with a further improvement in the margin of about 100 basis points (reporting
year: 0.4 percent).

The basis for an increasing Group margin is a substantial improvement in the Engineering & Tech-
nologies segment. Following a loss in the reporting year, we expect a positive result here. In the Main-
tenance, Modifications & Operations segment, on the other hand, we expect a slight decrease in the

Adjusted free cash flow In 2017, adjusted free cash flow will improve significantly as compared to
the reporting year (-€111 million).

Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment We expect capital expenditure on property,
plant and equipment to rise as compared to the reporting year due to backlog effects. At a share of
a good 2 percent of our output volume, there are at the upper end of the sustainable level of between
1.5 and 2 percent.

Financing We have a syndicated cash credit line of €300 million available which is due in 2018.
We expect that the limit defined in the loan agreement for the covenant (dynamic gearing ratio = adjust-
ed net debt / adjusted EBITA) can be maintained.

General statement from the Executive Board of Bilfinger SE on the anticipated
development of the Group

Following a difficult financial year 2016, we are concentrating on improving operating performance and
on the implementation of the strategy introduced in February 2017: we want to establish a basis for
profitable growth by building on our strengths.

Effects from our efficiency enhancement program and from capacity adjustment measures will also
contribute to improved margins despite the fact that markets will remain challenging. The new organ-
ization makes us stronger in our markets and will lead to leaner processes and thus to a greater level
of efficiency.

Authorization of the Executive Board with regard to the buy-back and issue

of shares

n February 2008, the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and on the basis of the
authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of May 23, 2007, bought back 1,884,000 shares
hrough the stock exchange at an average price of €53.07 per share. Of these, a total of 59,517 shares
was issued during financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015 as part of employee stock ownership plans and
another 9,298 were issued for the same purpose during the reporting period. Afterwards, the company
holds 1,815,085 treasury shares; this corresponds to 3.94 percent of the current voting rights.
The company has no rights from these treasury shares (Section 71 b AktG). In accordance with the
resolution of May 23, 2007, the Executive Board can sell these shares through the stock exchange, offer
hem for sale to shareholders under consideration of the principle of equal treatment, use them within
he scope of corporate mergers or acquisitions or for the fulfillment of conversion and option rights or

recall them without any further resolution by an Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting
held on April 18, 2013 authorized the Executive Board, among other things, to offer these treasury
shares for sale or to pledge / transfer them, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to employees
of Bilfinger SE and subordinated subsidiary companies as well as to the management of subordinated
subsidiary companies; this also includes authorization to offer the shares for sale under other special
conditions or to pledge / transfer them at no cost. The Annual General Meeting of May 7, 2015 also
authorized the Supervisory Board to use the shares to meet the rights of members of the Executive
Board to the granting of shares of Bilfinger SE which the Supervisory Board had granted as part of the
Executive Board remuneration.

The Annual General Meeting of May 7, 2015 canceled the authorization from the Annual General
Meeting of April 18, 2013 to acquire the company’s own shares; the authorizations in the resolutions of
the Annual General Meeting of April 18, 2013 on the use of the company’s own shares are not affected.
It authorized the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to acquire the company’s
own shares until May 6, 2020 in an amount of €13,807,238 of the current share capital under the condi-
tion that the shares to be acquired on the basis of this authorization, together with other shares held by

the company which the company has already acquired and which are still in its possession or attributa-
ble to the company in accordance with Sections 71d and 71e of the AktG, at no time exceed 10 percent
of the share capital. Furthermore, the requirements of Section 71 Subsection 2 Sentences 2 and 3 AktG
are also to be observed. The acquisition may not be used for the purpose of trading in treasury shares.
