Market development

Euro area economy feeling effects of global headwind, interest
rates still low

GDP growth in the euro area came in at 1.8 per cent for 2018, which was lower than in 2017, mainly due to weaker support
rom net exports. In contrast, the inflation rate rose significantly up until mid-2018 and for the most part slightly exceeded the
European Central Bank's (ECB) target in the second half of the year. It was only towards the end of the year that inflation started
0 retreat below the 2 per cent level again. This up-and-down pattern was mainly due to the energy price trend, in turn driven by
volatile oil prices.

The ECB left key rates unchanged in 2018 and incrementally scaled back its bond purchase program: Its net monthly purchases
averaged € 30 billion from January to September 2018, with its net monthly volume reduced to € 15 billion from October to end-
December 2018, at which time the program was completely halted. Money market rates remained largely flat across all maturi-
ies throughout the year. The yield on 10-year German government bonds, however, strongly fluctuated with rates of between

0.8 per cent in February to under 0.2 per cent in May being observed. Overall, it was a light downward trend (start of year:

0.4 per cent, end of year: 0.2 per cent).

Austria's economy put in a very robust performance once again in 2018, although it lost some growth momentum over the year.
Thanks to the very strong 2017/2018 winter months, real GDP growth reached 2.7 per cent overall, following growth of

2.6 per cent in 2017. The overall positive development was broad based: exports withstood mounting global headwinds while
private consumption continued to rise at a stable rate. Likewise, the strong equipment investment cycle continued in 2018 - albeit
at a somewhat slower pace. Employment growth hit its peak in early 2018, posting its strongest growth rate in full-year 2018
since the beginning of the 90s. Mirroring this trend, the unemployment rate dropped below 5 per cent to come in at 4.9 per cent
(2017: 5.5 per cent).

The US economy got off to a strong start in 2018 with quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.2 per cent (annualized) in the first quarter. It
continued to expand at a significantly faster pace thereafter, averaging nearly 4 per cent per quarter (annualized) thanks to
sizable tax cuts and a very large government spending package in the summer months. This positive development was thus pri-

marily driven by consumer spending. In contrast, growth in investments weakened noticeably throughout the year. On balance, US
economic output increased 2.9 per cent for fullyear 2018.

In China, economic growth momentum slackened in 2018: Real GDP growth came to 6.6 per cent for the full year, around

0.3 percentage points below the previous year's rate. This was mainly attributable to the Chinese government's restructuring
measures. Credit growth - notably on the part of shadow banks - slowed considerably while investment and production momen-
tum temporarily dropped to the lowest level since 2015. In contrast, the simmering trade conflict with the US was initially reflected
only in sentiment surveys while exports held up well for the time being thanks to pull-forward effects.

Solid economic growth in CE and SEE despite slowdown,
growth in Russia benefits from one-off effects

Inflation in the CE region fluctuated around the 2 per cent level since the beginning of 2018, whereas in SEE it continuously
climbed to a peak of just over 4 per cent before beginning to ease back slightly. Stronger inflation momentum in Southeastern
Europe was largely driven by Romania, where it recently began to moderate again. Inflation rates in the CE region averaged

2.0 per cent and 3.4 per cent in the SEE region. The Czech central bank was the first in Europe to begin the interest rate normali-
zation process, which commenced in August 2017 against the backdrop of a renewed pickup in inflation and a relatively weak
Czech koruna / euro exchange rate. While Romania soon followed with liquidity tightening measures, subsequently hiking rates in
early 2018, Hungary waited until the third quarter of 2018 to raise the prospect of a similar exit procedure, which it expects to
implement in 2019. In contrast, Poland’s monetary policy remained neutral given the country’s muted pace of reflation.

GDP growth in the Central European (CE) region reached 4.5 per cent in 2018, and again exceeded the 4 per cent level
(2017: 4.5 per cent) despite a modest slowdown. At country level, Poland was the top performer with 5.1 per cent GDP growth.
Domestic demand was again the main driver of economic growth in the CE region in 2018. Investment spending remained dy-
namic while private consumption also started to record solid growth rates again in 2018. This was supported by the continued

decline in unemployment rates, which even hit all-time lows in some of the region's countries. The resulting manpower shortage
was reflected in appreciably higher wages.

In Southeastern Europe (SEE), GDP growth slowed again to 3.7 per cent d

Banking sector in Austria

In 2018 the Austrian banking sector continued its solid performance from the previous year, underpinned by the positive macroe-
conomic trend. The corporate customer business in particular put in a robust performance in 2018 - also for longer loan maturi-
ties. The sector likewise benefited from continued dynamic real estate lending although macro-prudential regulation has been
tightened significantly in this area over the past two years. Supported by low loan loss provisioning in domestic and foreign busi-
ness, the return on equity of the Austrian banks not only continued to maintain a robust level of nearly 11 per cent on a consoli-
dated basis in 2018, but this was also well above the euro area average. This positive earnings performance was supported in
large measure by favorable business developments in the CEE region, notably in the Czech Republic, Russia, Romania, Hungary,
Croatia and Slovakia. Adjustments and efficiency enhancement programs of recent years are also having an impact. Given the
positive overall market trend, the Austrian banking sector continued to improve its capitalization relative to other Western Europe-
an banking sectors during the period under review, as also evidenced by the latest stress test results at the European level. How-
ever, capital requirements will continue to increase gradually as a result of the introduction both of the systemic risk buffer and of
the buffer for Other Systemically Important Institutions, which the Financial Market Stability Board has recommended. The reduc-
tion in the bank tax implemented in 2017, should also have a positive impact on the profitability of Austria's (major) banks in the
years ahead.

Development of the banking sector in CEE

Multiple factors in 2018 underpinned the significant recovery of the CEE banking sector relative to the partly still subdued devel-
opment of the previous years. New lending and asset growth both continued to accelerate in some CE and SEE countries (e.g. in
he Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania). Moreover, a greater number of banking markets (e.g. Hungary, Serbia and Croatia,
as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina) participated in the overall positive trend, with significant asset growth recorded virtually
across the board. In Russia, foreign banks with a sustainable business model benefited from the generally improving general
market environment despite a further market shakeout driven by the central bank. In particular, the necessary nationalization of
wo of the larger banks in Russia in the fall of 2017 had no impact either on the overall market or on Western foreign banks
operating as niche players, which even increased their market share slightly in Russia in 2018. Virtually all CEE banking markets
now show a comfortable loan/deposit ratio (well below 100 per cent for the most part), which constitutes a solid foundation for
uture growth. In addition, significant progress was made in terms of reducing non-performing loans (NPs). In CE and SEE in
particular, the NPL ratio dropped to just under 5 per cent in 2018, its lowest level since 2008. Against the backdrop of the posi-
ive overall market development, return on equity in the CEE banking sector solidified at double-digit levels in 2018. In particular,
banking markets in Southeastern Europe made a significant recovery. As a result, major Western European banks operating in the
CEE region also posted a double-digit return on equity in 2018.

Regulatory environment

Changes in the regulatory environment

In the year under review, RBI continued to focus intensively on current and forthcoming regulatory developments.

Changes to prudential requirements (CRD IV/CRR) and the recovery and resolution
framework (BRRD, SRMR)

The European Commission's proposals to revise the Capital Requirements Directive I\V/Capital Requirements Regulation and the
Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) have been finalized by the European legislature. The regulations are expected to
take effect in 2021 and 2022, respectively. As far as RBI is concerned, the deduction exemption for software is particularly im-
portant in creating a level playing field with the US. The legislation also harmonizes reporting requirements for credit institutions.
Other key changes include parameters for reducing risk-weighted assets for SMEs and infrastructure projects.

Basel IV

At the end of 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized the new international rules for calculating capital
requirements under Pillar | (Basel IV). The primary objective of the new rules is to make banks’ risk calculations more comparable.
To accomplish this, not only were large parts of the standard models changed, but the scope of application of internal models
was also restricted and the requirements for these models were revised. In addition, an output floor will be phased in by 2027,
which sets a floor for capital requirements calculated using internal models at 72.5 per cent of the values calculated using the
standard models.

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2018
47

The Basel Committee is aiming for an implementation date of 1 January 2022. However, there is still no full legal implementation
of the standards for the EU, which also means there are no detailed guidelines with respect to the expected implementation date.

BCBS 239

In January 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued 14 generally formulated principles for risk data aggrega-
tion and risk reporting of credit institutions (BCBS 239). They reflect the Basel Committee's conclusions that data quality and
governance play a fundamental role in bank management and efficiency of banking operations.

Due to its classification as a systemically important institution, RBI is required to comply with these principles. It has developed a
comprehensive Group-wide action and implementation plan that ensures compliance with the BCBS 239 principles which is
currently being implemented in consultation with the relevant supervisory authorities.

Bank recovery and bank resolution

The BRRD was transposed into Austrian law by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Act (BaSAG)}. The review of the original BRRD
was negotiated up until the end of 2018 as part of the trilogue process. It must be implemented within two years of its publication
- which is expected in Q2 2019 - by an amendment to the BaSAG.

RBI has a Group recovery plan as required by law. It sets out measures for restoring financial stability in the event that this be-
comes necessary. The BaSAG also requires the resolution authority, in close collaboration with RBI, to draw up resolution plans
based on the preferred resolution strategy, including analyzing which liabilities are eligible as MREL (minimum requirement for
own funds and eligible liabilities). RBI has adopted a multiple point of entry (MPE) approach as the preferred resolution strategy.
The resolution authorities define resolution groups, and for each resolution group an individual resolution plan has to be devel-
oped. The resolution plan has to describe the resolution strategy and its implementation, by the use of the resolution tools. The
resolution authority decides which resolution tools (sale of business, bridge institution, asset separation and bailin) should be used.
Official MREL quotas are being set for each resolution group and are expected for the second half of 2019.

Payment Services Directive 2

The new Payment Services Directive (PSD 2), which came into force on 13 January 2018, is designed to better protect consumers
by promoting service security and the use of new technologies as part of an open banking system. The directive opens up the
payment services market to new participants - known as third-party providers (TPPs) - such as fintech companies. It also regulates
IPPs’ relationships with traditional banks, which are required to give the TPPs access to the accounts of customers who have given
heir consent. These rules governing TPP access to payment service user data will take effect on 14 September 2019. They were
urther elaborated on in the course of last year while work on their implementation had already begun.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR} has been in effect since 25 May 2018. It applies to personal data (e.g. that
of customers or employees} and strengthens the rights of control that individuals have with respect to their data. The GDPR affects
all departments at RBI that handle individuals’ personal data. RBI has adopted the new requirements as part of a wide-ranging
project. Various processes were implemented, including those for complying with the data subjects’ rights (e.g. right of access,
right of erasure) and identifying personal data protection breaches; the required IT framework was created; relevant contracts
were thoroughly reviewed and examined; and the requisite organizational structure was established. In addition to the project at
head office, other projects were conducted at the network units and the Austrian companies in which equity participations are
held, with coordination and support provided by head office.

Capital markets and sustainable financing

The implementation of MiFID II began in 2018, which had a large-scale effect on RBI's market and customer divisions and re-
quired an extensive implementation project. PRIIPs (Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products) under which a 3-
page standard customer information sheet is required for packaged (securities) products also came into effect in 2018. One new
issue on European level is the regulation of covered bonds, which has not yet been implemented in Austria. The changeover of
benchmark indices and related uncertainty - primarily Eonia and Euribor, scheduled for early 2020 - was postponed for two
years in response to market participants’ objections and concerns (implementation beginning in early 2022). Other important new
developments for all financial market participants include the Commission's action plan and regulatory proposals on sustainable

financing and investments, which aim to reorient capital flows towards green and sustainable economic activities from 2022
onwards. The objective is to transition financial sector products, services and activities - including transparency measures and
corporate governance - to a framework based on uniform definitions and standards.

Regulatory compliance (§ 39 (6) of the Austrian Banking Act (BWG))

The EBA’s Guidelines on Internal Governance were transposed into Austrian law in 2018. The process added new provisions to
the Banking Act (8 39 (6) BWG) which came into effect on 1 January 2019. There are now stronger regulatory compliance
requirements for monitoring and ensuring RBI's adherence to applicable Austrian law. The implementation of these activities at RBI
builds on existing methods and tools.

Banking supervision

In 2018, the ECB’s banking supervision activities focused on four areas: risks related to the business model, profitability, credit risk
with emphasis on non-performing loans, and risk management in general. In relation to this fourth area, i.e. activities with multiple
tisk dimensions, RBI participated in the European Banking Authority’s EU-wide stress test in 2018. The stress test results essentially
depend on three factors: the capital ratio at the beginning of the stress test, losses caused by the simulated stress scenario, and
the resulting capital ratio at the end of the stress test horizon. RBI's performance with respect to these factors was significantly
better than in the previous stress test conducted in 2016 (participating institution: RLB Holding), although the 2018 test was more
stringent. In an adverse scenario, RBI's hypothetical remaining common equity tier 1 ratio (CET 1) was projected to stand at

9.7 per cent in 2020. The stress scenario simulated a sharp slump in economic growth and house prices as well as pessimistic
assumptions about economic developments in most Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries. RBI's better result
reflects in particular the strengthening of its capital ratio following the merger of RZB and RBI and improved portfolio quality.

In 2018, the focus of the Joint Supervisory Team included interest rate risk in RBI's banking book and a review of the internal
credit risk models.

Signiticant events in the
reporting period

Adoption of IFRS 9

On 1 January 2018, the new accounting standard for financial instruments (IFRS 9) took effect. This replaces the previous ac-
counting standard, IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). The regulations set out in the new standard are
primarily reflected in the impairment on financial instruments valued at amortized cost or at fair value recognized directly in equity.
Under IFRS 9, the impairment requirements also apply to credit commitments and financial guarantees off the statement of finan-
cial position. The model used to determine impairment loss changes from a historically oriented model under IAS 39 (incurred
osses} to a future oriented model under IFRS 9 (expected losses). The impact of the new regulations on the market valuation of
oans, by contrast, is of lesser significance. In total, € 301 million of loans must be accounted for at market value, representing
0.3 per cent of the volume of financial instruments.

The adoption resulted in an adjustment of minus € 169 million to equity on 1 January 2018, taking deferred taxes into account;
he effect on the CET1 ratio (fully loaded) amounted to around 19 basis points. Impairment losses increased € 285 million. As a
result of the new classification of financial instruments, there was a positive impact of € 70 million, which was essentially due to the
reallocation of liabilities recognized at fair value.

n addition to the adoption of IFRS 9, RBI also changed the presentation of its balance sheet, which is now aligned with the finan-
cial reporting standards (FINREP} issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA). With the adoption of the standards, it was also

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2018
49

necessary to adjust the figures comparable period and comparable reporting date. The changes are described in more detail in
he notes, in the chapter on principles underlying the consolidated financial statements, under changes in the presentation of
inancial statements.

Sale of RBI's Polish subsidiary’s core banking operations to BGZ BNP

n April 2018, RBI signed a contract to sell the core banking operations of Raiffeisen Bank Polska S.A. by way of demerger to
Bank BGZ BNP Paribas S.A., a subsidiary of BNP Paribas S.A. (BNP). Following receipt of the regulatory approvals in particular,
and eventual demerger, the transaction closed on 31 October 2018.

The sales price was PLN 3,250 million (€ 749 million), equating to a price/tangible book value multiple of 0.94 times. This is
based on core banking operations equity of approximately € 869 million at the time of the demerger. The sale resulted in a
positive impact of 85 basis points on RBI Group's CET1 ratio (fully loaded). Under the terms of the agreement with the buyer, total
assets of approximately € 9.5 billion and total riskweighted assets of approximately € 4.9 billion have been allocated to the core
banking operations.

The direct impact of the sale on RBI Group's consolidated profit amounted to minus € 120 million, already recognized in the
income statement in the second quarter of 2018. Additional equity neutral effects from the disposal after closing amounted to
minus € 64 million and was primarily due to already realized currency effects.

RBI transferred the remaining Raiffeisen Bank Polska S.A. operations following the demerger, mainly comprising the foreign curren-
cy retail mortgage loan portfolio, to a newly established Polish branch of RBI AG. The branch has total assets of approximately
€ 3.2 billion at its disposal as at the reporting date.

Placement of additional tier 1 capital (AT1)

RBI placed a perpetual AT1 capital issue in an amount of € 500 million and with a value date of 24 January 2018. The issue has
a discretionary coupon of 4.5 per cent p.a. until midjune 2025, after which it will be reset. The AT1 is classified as equity under
IAS 32 due to the terms and conditions of the issue. As a result of this issue, together with the € 650 million AT] capital placed in
July 2017, RBI has now completed its planned AT] issuance program.

Green bond issuance

On 28 June, RBI issued the first benchmark-sized green bond from an Austrian bank. The bond has a notional amount of

€ 500 million, a maturity of three years, and carries a coupon of mid-swap plus 40 basis points. The offering was significantly
oversubscribed, with an order book of € 1.3 billion. The issuance forms part of RBI's ongoing strategy - which it has been putting
into effect for many years - to pursue sustainable business activities. The proceeds from the green bond will be used to finance
sustainable projects across the entire RBI network. The allocation of funds follows a clearly defined selection and evaluation
process. Ongoing reporting also ensures that the criteria are fulfilled after the investment is made and assesses the contribution to
improved sustainability.

Earnings and tinancial performance

In the 2018 financial year, RBI continued to utilize the positive economic developments in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as
in Austria, to generate further growth. The operating result improved 8 per cent, or € 162 million, to € 2,250 million, compared to
the previous year, mainly due to higher interest income as well as higher fee and commission income. Lending volumes were up

4 per cent year-on-year, despite the deconsolidation of the Polish core banking operations. The continued positive economic
environment facilitated a further reduction of non-performing loans in 2018, and many loans were sold at a profit as a result of
active risk management on the part of RBI. At € 166 million, impairment losses on financial assets were € 146 million below the
previous year, though new impairment losses of € 159 million were recognized in the fourth quarter for the fine-tuning of IFRS 9
models, as well as for expected credit risks arising from specific events which were not fully captured by the risk models.

The loss of € 120 million reported in the other result from the sale of the Polish core banking operations constituted a significant
one-off effect. There was also an effect of minus € 64 million from the recycling of accumulated foreign currency differences
previously recognized in equity as other comprehensive income.

Consolidated profit for the reporting period amounted to € 1,270 million, an improvement of 14 per cent, or € 154 million, com-
pared to the prior year.

The Management Board has resolved to propose a dividend payment of € 0.93 per share for the 2018 financial year to the
Annual General Meeting. This would correspond to a maximum dividend payout of € 306 million and a payout ratio of
24 per cent.

Operating income

Operating income was up 4 per cent year-on-year, or

€ 199 million, to € 5,298 million. Net interest income rose

4 per cent to € 3,362 million driven by lending growth, with
Group average interestbearing assets up 3 per cent. There was
loan growth in almost all markets, with the main contributions
coming from head office, the Czech Republic, Romania, and
Slovakia. The net interest margin rose 3 basis points to

2.50 per cent, primarily driven by higher interest rates in Romania,
the Czech Republic, and Ukraine. Net fee and commission in-
come was up € 72 million year-on-year to € 1,791 million despite
significant depreciation of Eastern European currencies (deprecia-
tion of the Russian ruble of 11 per cent and of the Belarusian
ruble of 9 per cent). Increases were mainly posted at Raiffeisen
Bausparkasse, head office, and in Romania.

General administrative expenses
General administrative expenses increased € 37 million year-on-

by 394 fulltime equivalents year-on-year to 49,745, due to the disposal of the Polish core banking operations. Excluding this
effect, full-time equivalents would have increased by 759. Staff expenses rose € 26 million to € 1,580 million, mainly due to a
higher level of salary increases in many markets, as well as higher bonus payments. Other administrative expenses rose

€ 21 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher deposit insurance fees in Russia, Romania, and Poland, as well as for IT services
purchased for innovation projects at head office. The number of business outlets declined 250 year-on-year to 2,159, mainly
reflecting the sale of the Polish core banking operations. Adjusting for the one-off effect of the sale, the reduction came to 13.

Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets was down 3 per cent, or € 10 million, with Russia and Croatia reporting the

largest reductions.

Other result

The other result amounted to minus € 161 million, compared to a flat result in the previous year. The main driver was the

€ 120 million loss from the sale of the Polish core banking operations. There was also an effect of minus € 64 million from recy-
cling accumulated foreign currency differences previously recognized under other comprehensive income. This was offset by a
higher results contribution from subsidiaries and associates (positive effect of € 21 million), mainly due to lower impairment losses
on associates.

The expense for levies and special governmental measures rose € 7 million year-on-year to € 170 million. This change mainly
resulted from a release of provisions totaling € 21 million in the previous year in connection with the Walkaway Law in Romania.
In contrast, contributions to the resolution fund, which (as with the majority of the bank levies) have to be recognized in full at the
start of the year, fell € 11 million primarily due to lower contributions in Romania and Austria. The expense for bank levies de-
clined € 5 million to € 116 million, reflecting the disposal of the Polish core banking operations.

Impairment losses on financial assets

Impairment losses on financial assets amounted to € 166 million in the reporting period, compared to € 312 million in the prior
year. Non-performing loans decreased, reflecting the good macroeconomic environment. Drivers of this positive trend also includ-
ed inflows and recoveries in an amount of € 587 million, generating a positive effect of € 116 million. The most significant
changes to risk costs occurred in the Group Corporates & Markets segment (down € 199 million), in Romania (down

€ 35 million) and in Croatia (down € 29 million). Impairment losses in the fourth quarter, however, were up € 159 million due to
fine-tuning of the IFRS 9 models (for performing loans) and provisions for expected credit losses, due to specific events which were
not fully captured by the risk models. The improvement in the NPL ratio continued in 2018: it declined 1.9 percentage points since
the start of the year and stood at 3.8 per cent at the end of December. The NPL coverage ratio rose a further 10.6 percentage
points to 77.6 per cent, primarily due to sales of highly collateralized loans and the firsttime application of IFRS 9.

Income taxes

The tax expense declined € 11 million to € 355 million. The effective tax rate declined 2 percentage points to 20 per cent. This
mainly reflected the improved earnings contribution from RBI AG.

Consolidated profit/loss

Profit attributable to non-controlling interests changed only slightly year-on-year, from € 130 million to € 128 million. Consolidated
profit improved € 154 million to € 1,270 million.

Development of fourth quarter 2018 compared to third quarter 2018
Operating income

et interest income was down 2 percent, or € 13 million, to € 843 million, reflecting a € 35 million decline in Poland due to the

sale of the Polish core banking operations, partly offset by higher interest income in a large number of other countries on the back
of higher volumes. The Czech Republic reported the strongest growth of € 7 million following increased customer loans. In Russia,
higher interest income, generated primarily from growth in investments in public sector bonds in the third quarter as well as higher
customer loan volumes, led to a € 2 million increase. RBI's net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 2.52 percent.

Compared to the third quarter of 2018, net fee and commission income improved 3 per cent, or € 12 million, to € 467 million.
The increase mainly resulted from higher fee and commission income from loan and guarantee business at head office and at
Raiffeisen Bausparkasse, as well as higher revenue from clearing, settlement and payment services in Russia. This was offset by
ower fee and commission income in Poland due to the sale of the Polish core banking operations.

et trading income was down € 7 million quarter-on-quarter to minus € 3 million, predominantly due to losses on assets held for
trading as well as negative currency differences. This was offset by lower valuation losses on loans in the mandatorily fair value
hrough profit/loss category.

et gains/losses from hedge accounting declined € 13 million, due to the recalibration of fair value hedges at head office.
Other net operating income fell quarter-on-quarter from € 14 million to € 8 million. This mainly reflected the recognition of other

provisions (increase of € 5 million) in Russia and Romania for litigation in the fourth quarter. Net income from derecognition of
inancial assets and liabilities fell € 4 million to € 2 million, primarily in the Czech Republic and Russia. Offsetting this, net income

from non-banking business improved € 5 million to € 15 million, due to developments in Slovenia, Belarus, and at Raiffeisen Leas-
ing Austria.

General administrative expenses

At € 819 million, general administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were up 12 per cent, or € 85 million, from € 734 million in
the previous quarter.

Staff expenses rose € 32 million quarter-on-quarter to € 416 million, primarily due to increases in provisions for retirement benefits,
bonus payments and severance payments, mainly at head office and in Russia, as well as the release of provisions for overdue
vacations in the third quarter. Growth in the number of staff in the fourth quarter occurred mostly in Russia and at head office.

Other administrative expenses were up € 45 million to € 325 million, driven by a seasonal increase in advertising expenses,
mainly in Russia, and due to legal, advisory and consulting expenses incurred at head office for the disposal of the Polish core
banking operations.

Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets rose € 8 million to € 79 million in the fourth quarter. This was mainly due to
an adjustment in relation to the useful life of a building in Hungary, as well as the capitalization of internally produced software in
Romania and at head office.

Other result

In the fourth quarter of 2018, the other result was minus € 74 million, compared to a positive result of € 7 million in the third
quarter. This was due to two main factors: In the fourth quarter, the recycling of cumulative foreign currency differences previously
recognized under other comprehensive income in connection with the sale of the Polish core banking operations generated a
negative effect of € 64 million, and impairment losses of € 19 million were recognized in relation to investments in associates.

Levies and special governmental measures

evies and expenses from special governmental measures declined € 4 million compared to the third quarter to € 13 million, with
he sale of the Polish core banking operations resulting in a € 4 million reduction in bank levies.

Impairment losses on financial assets

n the fourth quarter of 2018, impairment losses on financial assets amounted to € 222 million, compared with € 28 million in the
previous quarter. The sharp rise in impairment losses derived mainly from provisions of € 105 million due to fine-tuning of the

FRS 9 models, and provisions of € 54 million for expected credit risks not fully captured by the model due to specific events
primarily potential sanctions relating to Russia).

The largest changes in this respect were in the Eastern Europe segment, with an increase of € 58 million. In Russia alone, impair-
ment losses were € 52 million higher. The increase in Central Europe amounted to € 54 million, of which € 20 million derived
rom Slovakia, and € 16 million from both the Czech Republic and Poland. In Southeastern Europe, the quarter-on-quarter in-
crease amounted to € 49 million, of which € 25 million was attributable to Romania, € 11 million to Croatia, and € 6 million to
Bulgaria. The Group Corporates & Markets segment posted an increase of € 27 million.

Income taxes

ncome taxes decreased € 71 million to € 40 million, mainly due to the level of profit. However, the effective tax rate increased
4 percentage points to 24 per cent.

Consolidated profit/loss
Consolidated profit reduced markedly by € 319 million to € 97 million. This mainly reflected a € 194 million increase in impair-

ment losses on financial assets and a € 124 million reduction in the operating result, driven primarily by the sale of the Polish core
banking operations and seasonal effects relating to general administrative expenses.

Statement of financial position

In 2018, RBI's total assets rose by 4 per cent, or € 4,969 million, to € 140,115 million, despite the sale of the Polish core bank-
ing operations (€ 9,506 million). Currency movements resulted in a € 661 million reduction; notably the depreciation of the Rus-
sian ruble against the euro by 13 per cent, of the Belarusian ruble by 5 per cent, and of the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty
each by 3 per cent, partly offset by the appreciation of the Ukrainian hryvnia by 6 per cent and of the US dollar by 5 per cent.

Assets
in € million 31/12/2018 31/12/2017 Change
Loans to banks 9998 10,741 (743) (6.9)%
Loans to customers 80,866 77 JAS 3,121 4.0%
Securities 19,778 21,967 (2,189) (10.0)%
Cash and other assets 29,473 24,694 4,780 19.4%

The 7 per cent, or € 743 million, decline in loans to banks to € 9,998 million, mainly resulted from a decrease in loans to the
Czech and Hungarian central banks.

Despite the sale of the Polish core banking operations, loans to customers rose 4 per cent, or € 3,121 million, to

€ 80,866 million. Without the sale, they would have increased by 10 per cent, or € 7,754 million. A significant rise was recorded
at head office (up € 3,596 million), due to shortterm (utilization of loan commitments) and long-term loans. In addition, loans to
households (mortgage loans} and non-financial corporations (investment financing) in particular increased; in the Czech Republic
up € 991 million or 10 per cent), in Romania (up € 898 million, or 19 per cent, in all product groups mainly to non-financial
corporations and to a lesser extent households), in Slovakia (up € 717 million, or 8 per cent, mainly mortgage loans to house-
holds) and in Russia (up € 568 million, or 7 per cent, despite the strong currency devaluation, mainly to nonfinancial corporations
and households). In Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe, loans to households increased by € 2,371 million and loans to
non-financial corporations by € 1,921 million.

The decline in securities was largely due to the sale of the Polish core banking operations (down € 3,311 million). This contrasted
with a € 990 million increase in Russian government bonds.

Since the beginning of the year, cash balances increased € 5,652 million to € 22,557 million, primarily at head office as a result
of deposits at the Austrian National Bank. Other assets fell € 872 million to € 6,916 million, mainly due to the decline in tangible
fixed assets, financial derivatives and tax receivables.

posted at head office (up € 5,007 million, or 34 per cent, primarily due to shortterm deposits), in Russia (up € 1,680 million, or

Equity on the statement of financial position

After taking into account the reduction of € 169 million resulting from the application of IFRS 9, equity including capital attributa-
ble to non-controlling interests increased € 1,341 million to € 12,413 million. Of this, € 496 million was attributable to capital
transactions and € 1,217 million to the total comprehensive income for the financial year, while dividend payments had a nega-
tive effect of € 343 million.

At the start of 2018, RBI placed € 500 million of perpetual Breakdown of equity
additional tier 1 capital (AT1). Taking into account the issuance
costs and the discount, this increased capital by € 496 million.
According to IAS 32, the AT1 is classified as equity due to the
terms and conditions of the issue.

n € millior

After RBI had not paid dividends to shareholders for the 2014
to 2016 financial years in order to strengthen the capital base,
the June 2018 Annual General Meeting approved a dividend
of € 0.62 per share for 2017. This resulted in a total payment
of € 204 million. A further € 79 million was paid to non-
controlling shareholders of Group companies and dividend
payments of € 60 million were attributable to the AT1 capital.

Total comprehensive income of € 1,217 million comprises profit
after tax of € 1,398 million and other comprehensive income of
minus € 181 million. Other comprehensive income was mainly ood aps a — 2018
affected by the Russian ruble exchange rate and the sale of the

Polish core banking operations. The depreciation of the Russian n capita Mi Earned

currency translation within the Group, which was partly offse
by net income from the hedging of the net investment in Russia (€ 42 million). The sale of the Polish core banking operations
resulted in a recycling of the accumulated currency translation differences of € 64 million from equity to the income statement.

apital

Total capital pursuant to the CRR/Austrian Banking Act (BWG)

As at 31 December 2018, RBI's common equity tier 1 (CET 1) after deductions amounted to € 9,702 million, representing an
increase of € 436 million compared to the end of 2017. The improvement was attributable to the recognition of profit generated
in the regulatory capital. CET] was reduced by the switch to the new IFRS 9 accounting standard on 1 January 2018, FX effects
and other deductions. Tier 1 capital after deductions increased by € 1,089 million to € 10,928 million, notably due to the issue
of € 500 million of perpetual additional tier 1 capital in January 2018 and to the changes in CET]. In contrast, tier 2 capital
declined € 690 million to € 2,363 million due to early repayments and maturing of capital instruments. RBI's total capital amount
ed to € 13,291 million, representing an increase of € 399 million compared to the end of 2017.

Risk-weighted assets (total RWA) increased € 770 million to € 72,672 million as at 31 December 2018. The increase was
primarily due to new business and to business developments in Group Corporates & Markets, Russia, Romania, the Czech
Republic (due inter alia to the termination of a securitization transaction) and Slovakia. This was offset by the sale of the Polish
core banking operations which reduced RWA by € 4,941 million.

The CET 1 ratio (fully loaded) improved 0.6 percentage points to 13.4 per cent, with the sale of the Polish core banking opera-

tions accounting for 0.9 percentage points. The tier 1 ratio (fully loaded) improved by 1.3 percentage points to 14.9 per cent,
and the total capital ratio (fully loaded) by 0.3 percentage points to 18.2 per cent.

Research and development

As a universal bank, RBI's activities also include research and development.

Product development

In financial engineering, customized solutions in connection with investments, financing and hedging are developed for customers.
Financial engineering encompasses not only structured investment products, but also structured financing in particular, i.e. financing
concepts that go beyond the use of standard instruments and are employed in areas such as acquisition or project financing. RBI
also develops individual solutions for its customers to hedge a broad spectrum of risks, from interest rate risk and currency risk
through to commodity price risk. Besides financial engineering, RBI is also actively working on the further development of integrat-
ed product solutions for international clearing, settlement and payment services in the area of cash management.

Digitalization

RBI is continuously focused on the prospects and opportunities that the ongoing process of digitalization in the financial sector
offers the Group. In view of the significance of this trend, RBI merged the former Group Strategy and Group Digital Banking &
Innovation divisions in 2018. The new Group Strategy & Innovation area reports to the CEO and combines the Strategy depart-
ment with the Fintech Partnerships and Innovation Management departments and the Group Transformation department. These
changes were made not only to develop and implement innovations and partnerships, but also to shift the focus onto the strategic
aspect of RBI's digital transformation. As part of its innovation strategy, the bank also established its own Innovation Board in April
2018 to coordinate and manage all of the Group's innovation activities.

RBI successfully concluded the first round of Elevator Lab, the fintech partnership program, at the start of 2018. Five selected
intechs presented the results of their pilot projects which they had developed over the previous four months. In May 2018, a
cooperation agreement was also entered into with one of the participants, kompany, an Austrian enterprise. Working jointly with
ompany, RBI has now developed and implemented an innovative know-your-customer (KYC) solution which is optimally aligned
o RBI's regulatory needs. RBI continues to hold in-depth talks with two other participating companies and is in the process of
developing joint projects.

n May 2018, RBI launched Elevator Ventures, its new corporate venture capital company. With investment capital of

€ 25 million, the company focuses on strategic direct investments in selected fintechs, co-investments and investments in other
venture capital funds. Elevator Ventures thus represents a logical extension of Elevator Lab, as participants can now be offered the
prospect of follow-up investments. Growth capital is therefore also available for young enterprises. Investment targets are fintechs
hat have gained some market experience and need capital to scale up their business models. Furthermore, RBI's expertise and
extensive network in CEE is of particular interest to international fintechs.

The second round of Elevator Lab started in October 2018. From more than 400 applications - a 20 per cent increase from
2017 - eight fintechs were selected to work on pilot projects jointly with RBI. For the first time, eight RBI network banks took part
in the selection of the fintechs in regional Elevator Lab Challenges.

n 2018, RBI not only expanded its collaboration with fintechs, but also increased the focus on strengthening the innovative capa-

bilities of its own employees. In June 2018, for example, RBI launched a group-wide intrapreneurship program. More than 3,600
employees registered for the program and 765 ideas were submitted. From August to December, eight interdisciplinary teams

worked on developing pilot projects. The employees also developed their knowledge of modern working practices and technol
ogies during the process.

n 2018, RBI also worked extensively on blockchain technology. The focus was on specific applications in trade finance, capital
markets business and in clearing, settlement and payment services. Moreover, the first feasibility studies for the necessary identifica-
ion processes were successfully concluded. To further develop blockchain solutions, RBI entered into a cooperation agreement
with the Institute for Cryptoeconomics at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. It has been a member of the interna-
ional blockchain consortium R3 since the end of 2017.

>The work that began in the previous year on advanced analytics - the advanced analysis and evaluation of data that can be
used to better understand and also manage business processes - was continued in the reporting period. A concept developed in
he prior year has now been made operational.

n 2018, RBI became the first bank in Austria to offer video identification (video ID) to its corporate customers. This allows cus-
omers to carry out the statutory identification by video in just a few minutes, eliminating the need for a time-consuming appoint
ment with a bank employee or notary. RBI has set up the Identification & Verification Competence Center in Vienna to implement
his service.

The network banks in CEE also regularly initiate innovative projects. RBI's subsidiary bank in Russia, for example, is a pioneer in
he implementation of blockchain technology. In September 2018, in cooperation with the Russian central bank and leading state
institutions and banks, it initiated the first mortgage certificate transaction on the state masterchain platform.

n 2018, Tatra banka was the first bank in Slovakia to introduce facial recognition in mobile banking to add to its list of biometric
innovations. With its extensive offering of digital and mobile banking products, Tatra banka is one of the leading banks in CEE
and regularly brings innovative solutions into the Group. In September 2018, Tatra banka, in collaboration with the HubHub co-
working center in Bratislava, opened its own Elevator Lab. The aim is to offer a platform for startups from various sectors to enable
hem to develop and scale their business ideas jointly with the bank's experts and IT and data specialists.

Ihe experience gained in head office and the network banks from the various digitalization projects is regularly evaluated and
enhanced. The stated goal of RBI's digitalization strategy is to refine these insights and implement them at other Group network

banks.

Internal control and risk management
system in relation to the Group
accounting process

Balanced and comprehensive financial reporting is a priority for RBI and its governing bodies. Compliance with all relevant statu-
ory requirements is of course a basic prerequisite. The Management Board is responsible for establishing and defining a suitable
internal control and risk management system that encompasses the entire accounting process while adhering to company
requirements. This is embedded in the company-wide framework for the internal control system (ICS).

The ICS is intended to provide the Management Board with the information needed to ensure effective and continuously improv-
ing internal controls for accounting. The control system is designed to comply with all relevant guidelines and regulations and to
optimize the conditions for specific control measures.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the relevant Austrian laws, predominantly the Austrian
Banking Act (BWG) and Austrian Commercial Code (UGB), which govern the preparation of consolidated annual financial
statements. The accounting standards, used to prepare the consolidated financial statements, are the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.

Control environment

An internal control system has been in place for many years at the Group, which includes directives and instructions on key
strategic issues. It incorporates:

" The hierarchical decision-making process for approving Group and company directives, as well as departmental and
divisional instructions.

= Process descriptions for the preparation, quality control, approval, publication, implementation, and monitoring of
directives and instructions.

= Regulations for the revision and repeal of directives and instructions.

The senior management of each Group unit is responsible for implementing the Group-wide instructions. Compliance with Group
rules is monitored by Group Accounting & Reporting and in the course of the audits performed by internal Group and local auditors.

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2018
59

The consolidated financial statements are prepared by Group Accounting & Reporting, which reports to the Chief Financial
Officer. The associated responsibilities are defined for the Group within the framework of a dedicated Group function.

Risk assessment

Significant risks relating to the Group accounting process are evaluated and monitored by the Management Board. Complex
accounting standards can increase the risk of errors, as can the use of differing valuation standards, particularly in relation to the
Group's principal financial instruments. A difficult business environment can also increase the risk of significant financial reporting
errors. For the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements, estimates have to be made for asset and liability items
for which no market value can be reliably determined. This is particularly relevant for credit business, equity participations and
goodwill. Social capital and the valuation of securities are also based on estimates.

Control measures

The preparation of financial information on an individual Group unit level is decentralized and carried out by each Group unit in
accordance with the RBI guidelines, with the calculation of parts of the impairment charges under IFRS 9 carried out centrally. The
Group unit employees and managers responsible for accounting are required to provide a full presentation and accurate valua-
tion of all transactions. Differences in local accounting standards can result in inconsistencies between local individual financial
statements and the financial information submitted to RBI. The local management is responsible for ensuring implementation o
mandatory internal control measures, such as the separation of functions and the principle of dual control. The reconciliation and
validation controls are imbedded in the aggregation, calculation and accounting valuation activities for all financial reporting
processes. Particular focus is placed on the controls for the core processes that play a fundamental role in the preparation of the
financial statements. This primarily relates to processes which are relevant for valuations, the results of which have a significan
impact on the financial statements (such as credit risk provisions, derivatives, equity participations, provisions for personnel ex-
penses and market risk).

Group consolidation

The financial statement data, which are examined by an external auditor or undergo an audit review, are mostly automatically
transferred to the IBM Cognos Controller consolidation system by the end of January of the subsequent year. The IT system is kept
secure by limiting access rights.

The plausibility of each Group unit's financial statements is initially checked by the responsible key account manager within Group
Accounting & Reporting. Group-level control activities comprise the analysis and, where necessary, modification of the financial
statements submitted by Group units. In this process, the results of meetings with representatives of the individual companies, in
which the financial statements are discussed, and comments from the audit of the financial statements are taken into account. The
discussions cover the plausibility of the individual financial statements as well as critical matters pertaining to the Group unit.

The subsequent consolidation steps are then performed using the consolidation system, including capital consolidation, expense
and income consolidation, and debt consolidation. Finally, intra-Group gains are eliminated where applicable. At the end of the
consolidation process, the notes to the financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and the BVG/UGB.

In addition to the Management Board, the general control system also encompasses middle management. All control measures
constitute part of the day-to-day business processes and are used to prevent, detect and correct any potential errors or inconsist-
encies in the financial reporting. Control measures range from managerial reviews of the results for the period, as well as the

specific reconciliation of accounts, through to analyzing ongoing accounting processes.

The consolidated financial statements and management report are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board
and are also presented to the full Supervisory Board for information. The consolidated financial statements are published as part
of the Annual Report on the company’s website and in the Wiener Zeitung’s official journal and are then filed in the commercial
register.

Information and communication

The consolidated financial statements are prepared using Group-wide standardized forms. The accounting and valuation stand-
ards are defined and explained in the RBI Group Accounts Manual and must be applied when preparing the financial statements.
Detailed instructions for the Group units on measuring credit risk and similar issues are provided in the Group directives. The rele-
vant units are kept abreast of any changes to the instructions and standards through regular training courses.

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2018

OVERVIEW OF RBI

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEGMENT REPORTS

60

Each year the Annual Report shows the consolidated results in the form of a complete set of consolidated financial statements.
These consolidated financial statements are examined by an external auditor. In addition, the Group management report contains
comments on the consolidated results in accordance with the statutory requirements.

Throughout the year, consolidated monthly reports are produced for the Group's senior management. The statutory interim reports
conform to the provisions of IAS 34 and are published quarterly in accordance with the Austrian Stock Exchange Act. Before
publication, the consolidated financial statements are presented to senior managers and the Chief Financial Officer for final
approval and then submitted to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. Analyses pertaining to the consolidated financial state-
ments are also provided for management, as are forecast Group figures at regular intervals. The financial and capital planning
process, undertaken by Group Planning & Finance, includes a three-year Group budget.

Monitoring

Financial reporting is a main focus of the ICS framework, whereby financial reporting processes are subject to monitoring and
control reviews, the results of which are regularly reported to the Management Board and the Supervisory Board for evaluation.
Additionally, the Audit Committee is required to monitor the financial reporting process. The Management Board is responsible for
ongoing company-wide monitoring. The internal control system is based on three lines of defense:

The first line of defense is formed by individual departments, where department heads are responsible for monitoring their business
areas. The departments conduct control activities and plausibility checks on a regular basis, in accordance with the documented
processes.

The second line of defense is provided by specialist areas focused on specific issues. These include, for example, Compliance,
Data Quality Governance, Operational Risk Controlling, and Security & Business Continuity Management. Their primary aim is to
support the individual departments when carrying out control steps, to validate the actual controls and to introduce state-of-the-art
practices within the organization.

nternal audits are the third line of defense in the monitoring process. Responsibility for auditing lies with Group Internal Audit and
also the respective internal audit departments of the Group units. All internal auditing activities are subject to the Group Audit
Standards, which are based on the Austrian Financial Market Authority's minimum internal auditing requirements and international
best practices. Group Internal Audit’s internal rules also apply (notably the Audit Charter). Group Audit regularly and inde-
pendently verifies compliance with the internal rules within the RBI Group units. The head of Group Internal Audit reports directly
to the Management Boards, with additional reporting obligations to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and members of the
Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.

328,939,621 voting common bearer shares. As at 31 December 2018, 322,204 of those were own shares, and consequently
328,617,417 shares were outstanding at the reporting date. In comparison with 31 December 2017 (394,942 shares}, this was
a reduction of 72,738 own shares and was due to the transferring of shares within the framework of the share-based remuneration

program. Please see note (30) for further disclosures.

(2) The Articles of Association contain no restrictions concerning voting rights or the transfer of shares. The principle of one share

one vote applies and there is only one class of shares. Shares with multiple voting rights are not permissible under § 12 (3) of the
Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The regional Raiffeisen banks and direct and indirect subsidiaries of the regional Raiffeisen
banks are parties to a syndicate contract (syndicate agreement) regarding RBI AG. The terms of this syndicate agreement include

not only a block voting agreement and preemption rights, but also a prohibition on sales of the RBI shares held by the regional
Raiffeisen banks (with few exceptions) for a period of three years (lock-up period) from the effective date of the merger between
RZB AG and RBI AG, i.e. from 18 March 2017, if the sale would reduce the regional Raiffeisen banks’ aggregate shareholding
in RBI AG (direct and/or indirect) to less than 50 per cent of the share capital plus one share. After the lock-up period expires, the
shareholding threshold falls to 40 per cent of the share capital of RBI AG.

3) RLB NO-Wien Sektorbeteiligungs GmbH holds around 22.24 per cent of the share capital of the company according to the
most recent notification of voting rights published on 7 September 2018. By virtue of the syndicate agreement regarding RBI AG,
he directly or indirectly held voting rights attached to a total of 193,449,778 shares, corresponding to a voting interest of around
58.81 per cent, are mutually attributable to the regional Raiffeisen banks and their direct and indirect subsidiaries pursuant to

88 130 and 133 7 of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act (BérseG) as parties acting in concert as defined in § 1 6 of the Austrian
Takeover Act (UbG] (see the notification of voting rights published on 7 September 2018). The remaining shares of RBI AG are
held in free float, with no other direct or indirect shareholdings amounting to 10 per cent or more known to the Management

(4) The Articles of Association do not contain any special rights of control associated with holding shares. According to the
syndicate agreement for RBI AG, the regional Raiffeisen banks can nominate nine members of the RBI AG Supervisory Board. In
addition to the members nominated by the regional Raiffeisen banks, the RBI AG Supervisory Board should also include three
independent representatives of free-float shareholders who are not attributable to the Austrian Raiffeisen Banking Group.

(5) There is no control of voting rights arising from interests held by employees in the share capital.

(6) Pursuant to the Articles of Association, a person who is 68 years or older may not be appointed as a member of the Man-

Outlook

Economic outlook

Central Europe

Economic conditions in Central Europe (CE) should remain favorable overall in 2019, despite global headwinds and that GDP
growth is expected to slow somewhat: A growth rate of 3.4 per cent is anticipated for 2019 - down from 4.5 per cent in 2018.
Thanks to a continuing decline in unemployment and solid real wage increases, private consumption should remain a stable pillar
of economic growth. Despite the prospect of lower GDP growth rates, investment is also likely to be a key source of support for
the economy in 2019. At country level, Slovakia and Poland are expected to post the strongest increases (at 4.0 per cent and
3.6 per cent, respectively).

Southeastern Europe

In Southeastern Europe (SEE), economic growth is expected to again slow to a low level. As in 2018, this is being driven by
economic developments in Romania, where the GDP makes up the largest contribution to the region. GDP growth of 2.5 per cent
is expected in Romania (following 4.1 per cent in 2018). In the remaining SEE countries, economic activity is expected to remain
relatively stable or slightly decline; with a slowdown to 2.8 per cent from 3.7 per cent in 2018. Economic activity is expected to
be driven primarily by domestic demand. An increase in wages should have a positive impact on spending on the part of private
households. Similarly, investment activity is expected to remain at high levels, albeit heavily dependent on progress made in the
utilization of EU funds and implementation of major infrastructure projects. All in all, the expected economic slowdown in the EU is
also likely to curb the region's economic growth in 2019 and 2020.

Eastern Europe

Following a somewhat stronger 2018, the Russian economy is expected to grow at a low rate of 1.5 per cent in 2019, and
herefore continue on its moderate growth trajectory. Oil prices should support the economy, while no significant impetus is ex-
pected from the continued comparatively restrictive monetary and fiscal policy. Risks of sanctions continue to persist, which could
negatively affect the currency and economic development. In Ukraine, parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for
2019, but the renewed cooperation with the International Monetary Fund should have a stabilizing effect. Economic growth in
Ukraine should reach a moderate 2.7 per cent in 2019.

Austria

Even though the economic peak in Austria has already passed, economic momentum should continue to remain over the average
euro area rate, despite slowing down and increased external risks. Following 2.7 per cent in 2018, GDP growth is expected to
expand at the low rate of from to 1.3 per cent in 2019. Domestic demand is anticipated to be the main driver while foreign trade
should increasingly feel the effects of global headwinds. Thanks to the continuation of good labor market conditions, private
consumption also looks set to achieve solid growth rates in 2019. Although investment activity should weaken, it is expected to
also support economic growth in 2019.

Banking sector in Austria

The positive trend in new business in the Austrian banking market should continue in 2019. Depending on the market segment,
credit growth rates are expected to range between 3 per cent and 5 per cent. A pick-up in the corporate customer business,
despite the economic slowdown, continued to support positive momentum in the sector. Moreover, the continuing positive wage
trends should support the granting of loans. Nonetheless, a moderate downturn in the granting of mortgage loans is expected
following stricter communication by the regulator. All in all, the return on equity of Austrian banks should be in the high single-digit
percentage range in 2019, with stable or only slightly increasing risk costs.

CEE banking sector
For the CEE banking markets, credit growth rates are expected to range between 5 per cent and 9 per cent over the next 12-18

months. Accordingly, solid economic growth in the CE and SEE regions should have an overall positive impact on CEE banks’
earnings in 2019, despite moderately weaker momentum. Given new unemployment rate lows in CE and SEE, growth in wages

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2018
65

should also be in the high single-digit percentage range in 2019, while some regional central banks in CE and SEE are expected
to cautiously normalize monetary policy. It is anticipated that tightened macroprudential regulations will curb mortgage and con-
sumer loan growth, notably in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania, but conversely also maintain the sustainable return
potential of these markets. Thanks to the adjustments carried out in recent years - e.g. reducing foreign currency loans and NPL
portfolios - there should be no significant negative impact on returns from this side. Likewise, given the still positive overall eco-
nomic growth and currently stable corporate insolvency situation, a significant increase in risk costs is not anticipated. Also, in
Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, the general conditions for the banking sector should develop favorably in 2019 in view of high local
interest rate levels and solid macroeconomic parameters. All in all, the return on equity of the CEE banking sector in 2019 should
almost reach its 2018 level, even though there is the possibility of a slight rise in risk costs in some regions (starting from low lev-
els). In Romania, a newly introduced bank tax is expected to have a negative impact on new loan business and the profitability of
the Romanian banking sector.

Outlook for RBI AG

We will pursue loan growth with an average yearly percentage increase in the mid-single digit area.
The provisioning ratio for FY 2019 is expected to be around 45 basis points.

We anticipate that the NPL ratio will further reduce.

We aim to achieve a cost/income ratio of around 55 per cent in 2021.

In the coming years we target a consolidated return on equity of approximately 11 per cent.

We seek to maintain a CET1 ratio of around 13 per cent in the medium term

Based on this target, we intend to distribute between 20 and 50 per cent of the consolidated profit.

Events atter the reporting date

Romanian bank tax

At the end of 2018, the Romanian Government decided to introduce a new bank tax. As there is discussion surrounding the
potential negative impact on the Romanian economy, there is still a need for consultation at government level. It therefore cannot
be ruled out, that the draft which was presented at the end of 2018, could still be revised and mitigate the burden on the banking
sector. The impact on RBI cannot be quantified at this point in time.

Segment overview

Segmentation principles

Segment reporting at RBI is based on the current organizational structure pursuant to IFRS 8. A cash generating unit within the
Group is a country. The Group's markets are thereby consolidated into regional segments comprising countries with comparable
economic profiles and similar longterm economic growth expectations.

This results in the following segments:

= Central Europe: Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia

" Southeastern Europe: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Romania, and Serbia

= Eastern Europe: Belarus, Russia and Ukraine

= Group Corporates & Markets (operating business booked in Austria): Austrian and international corporate customers, Markets,
Financial Institutions & Sovereigns, business with the Raiffeisen Banking Group (RBG) and specialized financial institution sub-
sidiaries, e.g. Raiffeisen Centrobank AG, Kathrein Privatbank Aktiengesellschaft, Raiffeisen Leasing Group, Raiffeisen Factor

Profit after tax in the Central Europe segment fell € 73 million year-on-year to € 346 million. This was mainly the result of a € 67
million decline in profit in Poland due to the sale of the Polish core banking operations. In Hungary, profit declined € 40 million as
a result of higher net releases of loan loss provisions due to sales of non-performing loans in the previous year and the deconsoli-
dation of a real estate fund. In contrast, the Czech Republic reported an increase in profit after tax of € 22 million, which was
mainly attributable to higher net interest income.

Operating income

et interest income increased 2 per cent year-on-year, or € 15 million, to € 965 million. This mainly reflected the positive perfor-
mance in the Czech Republic, where higher market interest rates and increased customer loan volumes in particular led to a rise
of € 58 million in net interest income. In Slovakia, net interest income was up € 15 million on higher customer loan volumes. In
contrast, net interest income in Poland fell € 54 million, largely as a result of the sale of the Polish core banking operations. In
Hungary, lower interest rates led to a € 4 million decrease in net interest income. The segment’s net interest margin improved 14
basis points to 2.27 per cent due to the positive trend in the Czech Republic.

et fee and commission income was down € 8 million year-on-year to € 549 million. The decline was attributable to the sale of
he Polish core banking operations. In Slovakia, in contrast, net fee and commission income increased € 6 million to € 163 million,
mainly driven by improved margins in the custody business. Hungary and the Czech Republic also both reported increases of € 4
million, primarily due to higher income from clearing, settlement and payment services and the guarantee business.

et trading income and fair value result fell € 9 million yearon-year to € 41 million. The Czech Republic reported a drop of

€ 29 million as a result of currency translation effects. In contrast, the result in Poland improved € 11 million, which was mainly
attributable to currency translation. In Hungary, the result was up € 8 million due to higher valuation gains from derivative financial
instruments.

Net gains from hedge accounting declined € 13 million year-on-year. The sale of the Polish core banking operations led to the
termination of the existing portfolio cash flow hedges in the second quarter of 2018, which were for hedging cash flow fluctua-
tions from foreign currency loans and deposits in local currency by means of foreign currency interest rate swaps. The termination
had a neutral effect on capital, but resulted in the reclassification through profit and loss of the cash flow hedge reserve of minus
€ 13 million recognized in other comprehensive income in previous periods.

Other net operating income declined € 40 million to minus € 34 million. The decrease of € 22 million in Poland was attributable
to the sale of the Polish core banking operations. In addition, income of € 10 million was no longer included following the decon-
solidation of a real estate fund in Hungary. The Czech Republic reported a reduction of € 10 million, which reflected the sale of
bonds and loans in the previous year.

General administrative expenses

General administrative expenses decreased € 33 million year-on-year to € 854 million. This was largely a consequence of the
sale of the Polish core banking operations at the end of October, which reduced expenses in Poland by € 30 million. Unlike in
Poland, staff expenses increased € 6 million in Slovakia and by € 2 million in Hungary due to salary adjustments, while office
space expenses fell € 10 million in Hungary as a result of a one-off effect in the previous year. IT expenses were down, particular-
ly in Hungary and Slovakia, with each reporting decreases of € 3 million.

The number of business outlets in the segment decreased 235 to 396 due to the sale of the Polish core banking operations, while
the average number of employees declined 842 to 12,720 as a result of the sale. The cost/income ratio decreased marginally
by 0.2 percentage points to 56.3 per cent.

Other result

The Central Europe segment’s other result decreased € 5 million to minus € 8 million, largely due to an impairment of goodwill
arising from the firsttime consolidation of a Hungarian real estate company.

Levies and special governmental measures

Levies and expenses from special governmental measures fell € 6 million year-on-year to € 85 million. Bank levies were down € 5
million to € 59 million, largely due to lower expenses in Poland resulting from the sale of the Polish core banking operations.
Contributions to the resolution fund also decreased, which have to be recognized in full at the start of the year, by € 2 million to
€ 26 million. Contributions declined the most in Poland and Slovakia, while the Czech Republic reported an increase.

Impairment losses on financial assets

In the reporting period, impairment losses on financial assets increased € 63 million to € 122 million. The largest change was
reported in Hungary, where net releases of loan loss provisions were down € 28 million year-on-year to € 24 million. In the corre-
sponding period of the previous year, successful collection activity and increased mortgage loan collateral valuations resulted in a
significantly higher net release. In Slovakia, risk costs were € 26 million, markedly above the very low level of € 4 million in the
same period of the previous year. The increase was partly due to fine-tuning of the calculations for Stage 3 loan loss provisions in
he retail customer business. In the Czech Republic, impairment losses increased € 12 million to € 33 million, with the increase
occurring in both the retail and the corporate customer businesses. Poland reported the highest impairment losses of € 89 million
in the reporting year (increase of € 2 million). The high level resulted from individual corporate customer defaults and adjustments
0 the LGD ratio and collateral values for Stage 3 loan loss provisions.

The proportion of non-bank non-performing loans in the loan portfolio was 3.6 per cent on 31 December 2018 (down 1.3 per
centage points). The NPL coverage ratio improved 10.8 percentage points to 78.6 per cent, mainly as a result of the adoption of
FRS 9.

Income taxes

The segment's income taxes decreased € 10 million to € 101 million. The decline in taxes was mostly attributable to the Czech
Republic (down € 18 million), where a higher tax expense was reported due to income tax from prior periods in the same period
of the previous year. In contrast, the tax expense was € 4 million higher in Hungary and € 3 million higher in Slovakia in the
reporting period. The tax rate was 23 per cent, 2 percentage points higher than in the previous year. The increase was attributa-
ble to non-deductible expenses in Poland.

Net interest income rose 11 per cent year-on-year, or ! 83 million, to ! 814 million. The strongest growth was seen in Romania
with an increase of ! 73 million. Higher market interest rates resulted in a significantly higher interest margin (up 59 basis points). In
addition, growth in lending to households and non-financial corporations also contributed to the rise. In Kosovo, net interest income
was up ! 5 million as a result of higher interest income on lo ans to non-financial corporations. In Serbia, net interest income was up
! 4 million, which mainly reflected currency effects. The increase of ! 2 million in net interest income in Bulgaria was mainly driven
by volumes. Croatia reported a decline of ! 1 million due to lower interest rates. In Albania, net interest income was also dow n

! 1 million due to lower volumes. The improvement of 16 basis points in the segment’s net interest margin to 3.60 per cent was
primarily attributable to the positive interest rate environment in Romania.

Net fee and commission income increased 5 per cent, or ! 20 million, to ! 421 million. The largest increase was reported in
Romania (up ! 13 million), due to higher volumes and margins in clearing, settlement and payment services, as well as in the cr edit
card business. In both Serbia and Bulgaria, net fee and commission income was up ! 4 million, mainly as a result of higher fee and
commission income in clearing, settlement and payment services.

Net trading income and the fair value result increased ! 10 million year-on-year to ! 31 million. Decreases due to currency tra nsla-
tion were more than offset by higher income from derivatives and loans and advances in Romania and Serbia.

The segment’s other net operating income declined ! 8 million to ! 22 million. While Serbia reported an increase of ! 8 million ,
mainly arising from the derecognition of financial assets and liabilities, Croatia reported a decrease of ! 12 million primarily due to
a reduction in the operating lease portfolio. In addition, Albania reported a decrease of ! 5 million, while there was a gain f rom
successful litigation in the same period of the previous year.
