What the Bouygues group does
Makes life better every day

Making progress become reality

It is the Bouygues group's firmly-held belief that meeting essential day-to-day needs with an ethical and responsible attitude helps drive improvement for
society as a whole. The goal of its five business segments - Bouygues Construction, Bouygues Immobilier, Colas, TFl and Bouygues Telecom - is to bring
innovative solutions designed with passion and respect to as many people as possible.

Strategy

The Bouygues group aims to create value over the long term and share it
with its stakeholders *. In order to do this, the Group draws on its stable
ownership structure and has defined a strategic framework through which
its business segments roll out their operational strategies.

The Group has made several distinctive and specific choices in order to
create and share value over the long term. Its five business segments are
able to provide growth over the long term since they all satisfy constantly
evolving and essential needs such as housing, transportation, entertainment
and communication. Furthermore, their diversity helps to cushion the impact
of the difficulties that some may experience from time to time. By combining

these two features, Bouygues is able to generate recurrent free cash flow.
The value created can then be reinvested to grow the Group and shared
with its stakeholders.

Bouygues also strives to maintain a robust financial situation in order to ensure
its independence and preserve its business model over time. For example,
the Group's construction businesses tie up a small amount of capital and
generate a high level of cash.

Bouygues’ strategy can be rolled out over the long term thanks to the
stability of its ownership structure (see opposite).

BOUYGUES’ STRENGTHS

Its people's commitment

e Tight control over the value chain
Skilled in incorporating the best internal and external expertise in order
to offer full-service solutions and remain a key partner for its customers;
partners of all shapes and sizes, from large companies to start-ups

The Group’s solutions
Build better, renovate, recycle, reuse

Bouygues supports its customers with their building and neighbourhood
development projects, encouraging them to adopt ambitious sustainable
construction (low carbon, passive or positive energy) standards, whilst
factoring in biodiversity at the same time. It contributes to the energy
renovation of the housing stock, which is key to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and improving user comfort.

The Group participates in developments that use eco-responsible and
recycled materials, as part of a responsible sourcing policy. It also shows
that it is possible to reuse secondary raw materials from the construction
sector in new buildings and takes part in the construction of large-scale
renewable energy production sites.

Combine quality of life with a lower environmental
footprint

Bouygues is involved in the design of sustainable neighbourhoods within
consortiums of urban players, such as businesses, start-ups, academic
institutions, non-profit organisations and local authorities. It is also a major
player in responsible mobility.

Technology to make life better every day

Bouygues invests in open and shared innovation in order to provide nimble
solutions to the changing needs of society. Digital communication tools
are used to improve urban living (smart city, etc.). With a view to providing
digital coverage across the whole of France, Bouygues Telecom has signed
a partnership with a non-profit body representing rural municipalities. It is
also preparing for the arrival of 5G.

Innovate with its eco-system to provide customised,
reliable and scalable products and services

Bouygues draws on outside expertise - such as from research centres and
suppliers - to create innovative products and services. In the field, the Group
focuses on consultation and co-design in order to strengthen buy-in by end-
users. Each of the Group's subsidiaries has set up a seed fund for start-ups.

114 Bouygues and innovation

Innovation is central to Bouygues' strategy. It is essential in order to create
more services for customers and more value added, and also to improve
competitiveness, whatever the project.

Before, during and after projects, Group companies innovate with their
stakeholders throughout the value chain in order to offer enduring solutions
in both societal and technological terms. They aim to imagine future uses,
improve the performance of materials and equipment, guarantee safety and
reduce the environmental impacts of their activities.

11.4.2 Serving the Group’s employees
and customers

The Internet of Things (loT) is permeating the whole of society via:

e the rapid spread of process-monitoring sensors in business and industry
and

e the proliferation of connected objects in people's everyday lives - in the
home, sport and healthcare.

(2) The Bouygues group's R&D and innovation unit.

12 * BOUYGUES + 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT

Strongly motivated by this finding, Bouygues has placed the Internet of
Things at the forefront of thinking within the Ideas Laboratory’. An open lab
unique in the French ecosystem, hosted by CEA ° in Grenoble, Bouygues
has been a partner since its creation in 2001. Both a place and mindset, it
is backed by a variety of players with the aim of renewing approaches to
innovation and creation by implementing collaborative, iterative and open
processes that generate physical or virtual outcomes.

In one of the lab's projects, digitisation is used to improve site worker safety
and quality of work, and to increase efficiency. In doing so Bouygues is taking


--- Page 8 ---

a first step towards an Industry 4.0 ecosystem and smart worksites that are
more adaptable and can allocate resources more efficiently.

For example, virtual reality can be used to boost and speed up the training of
site workers as well as to simulate high-risk situations in almost-real conditions
but without danger. Bouygues Construction and Colas site workers will
be trained to help them better anticipate and react to dangerous or risky
situations. Elsewhere in the Group, Bouygues Immobilier's customers can
use virtual reality to help them visualise their future home, while TF1 viewers
with a virtual reality headset can use the MyTF1 VR app to follow certain TV
shows as an immersive experience.

The Internet of Things is now an integral part of people's lives, especially
on Bouygues worksites. Objenious, a Bouygues Telecom subsidiary
dedicated to loT using the LoRa network, is accelerating the many innovative
developments being rolled out on worksites. Most of these business apps
have their origins in open innovation initiatives with start-ups.

114.3 From the augmented worksite
to the augmented urban environment

For customers, whole urban environments are also becoming augmented:

BUILDINGS: the hi-tech ABC (Autonomous Building for Citizens) concept
was rolled out for the first time in October 2018 in an initial building being
built in Grenoble. It aims to achieve self-sufficiency in water and energy
and to optimise waste management. The target is 70% in terms of water
and energy self-sufficiency and to generate 40% less household waste.
Likewise, with the Elsa (Energy Local Storage Advanced) project, Bouygues
Energies & Services is taking part in a European project whose aim is to
give a new lease of life to electric vehicle batteries by re-using them to
manage energy in buildings.

ROADS: Colas, in collaboration with CEA Tech, has designed Flowell, a

smart road solution based on remote-controlled dynamic light-emitting
road markings. The solution comprises panels composed of LEDs

encapsulated in a multilayer substrate and connected to an electrical
grid. Flowell, currently in its development phase, is designed to change
road markings dynamically according to use so that roads may become
shared spaces. It has many potential uses: pedestrian crossings can light
up when people use them, road lanes can open or close according to the
amount of traffic, a delivery space can turn into a parking space at night,
or temporary drop-off/pick-up spaces can be created around schools.

NEIGHBOURHOODS: with its Confluence project, Bouygues Immobilier
has developed the first demonstrator of the use of blockchain? to manage
energy at the neighbourhood level. The technology can be used to
distribute energy self-generated by buildings to occupants in real time.
Energy distribution is tracked using blockchain, informing occupants of
the amount of local energy they have actually consumed. Citybox makes
street lighting networks smart by turning them into platforms for innovative
services. Municipalities and local authorities need to control their spending
on street lighting and other facilities while offering new digital services.
OnDijon, a consortium led by Bouygues Energies & Services, has developed
acentralised, connected control station to manage public facilities (and
the related services) across the 24 municipalities that make up Dijon's
metropolitan area. This smart city project covers a catchment area of
250,000 inhabitants. Among other benefits, the authorities are targeting
a 65% saving in the energy consumed by street lighting.

THE GROUP
Profile

1144 Augmented intelligence

Bouygues is also providing new uses and services in buildings with the Cyber
Valet app. Bouygues Energies & Services has teamed up with Cisco and
Valeo to develop a self-parking system for cars. Trials have been carried out
using around 40 cameras placed around a distance of 500 metres travelled
by a vehicle within a car park of 1,000 m?. The cameras analyse the vehicle's
environment in real time and instruct it how to move. The vehicle is fitted with
front and back ultra-sound sensors able to detect empty car parking spaces.

These new technologies will not only help to optimise and better manage
resources but will also make everyday life easier for the residents of a
neighbourhood or town. Bouygues believes that the imminent arrival of
5G technology is an opportunity to capitalise on the diversity and good
match between its various business activities. Its in-house accelerator, SmartX
5G, will knit together all the Group's initiatives in this domain. Partners,
customers and research labs will be called upon to test and develop the
uses of tomorrow's smart city.

With IBM Watson, Bouygues Telecom is developing customer support
chatbots. These are the first steps in the implementation of artificial
intelligence to make relations with Bouygues Telecom's customers even
more tailored and effective. In terms of service quality, the aim is also to
move from predictive to prescriptive analytics.

11.4.5 Ecosystem and new business models

The Bouygues group's business segments are uniquely well-placed to foster
collective thinking about how to create new interfaces between infrastructure
ofall kinds, from public and private buildings and roads to shopping centres
and utilities, for the benefit of all urban stakeholders.

Bouygues has launched an initiative entitled “Innovate like a start-up",
which brings together each year a "tribe" of 50 Group employees from its
five business segments to consider issues related to the city of the future.
Working in nimble mode, this tribe devises new business models designed to
be rolled out ona large scale. The "productive city” was the theme of 2018.

e With Moov'Hub, developed within a partnership, Colas is developing
a range of smart mobility products and services. Mobility is no longer
focused on roads alone, but it is enhanced with services for managers
and users alike. Via this platform, vehicle users will be able to access all
the information and services required to move around and park in the city.

e Via Objenious, Bouygues Telecom provides local authorities with discovery
kits of solutions connected to its own network of connected objects, which
is designed to keep tight control of public spending, improve services for
citizens and reduce the carbon footprint.

For the city of the future, Bouygues is involved in new societal initiatives
that go far beyond mere dialogue with local residents. For the Les Fabriques
eco-neighbourhood project in Marseille, the Group is preparing for what the
area will be like in ten years’ time in terms of transport, services, renewable
energies and connectivity. The aim is to create an eco-neighbourhood that
meets the standards of the future so that it is attractive to all the different
types of resident. The key idea is to take what is there already and improve it.

Sales at TF1 were €2,288 million, up 7% on 2017
(up 2% on a like-for-like basis and at constant

services rose by 5% to €4,256 million, boosted
mainly by an increase in the customer base.

Current operating profit

The Bouygues group generated current operating
profit of €1,511 million in 2018, 7% more than
in 2017.

Current operating profit for the construction
businesses was €915 million, down €28 million
year-on-year. Stripping out the impact of
Nextdoor? in 2017 and of Axione? in 2018,
current operating profit would have decreased
by €106 million, due mainly to difficulties
encountered on three projects at Bouygues
Energies & Services, and in Colas' specialized
activities in the third quarter of 2018. In line with
expectations, current operating margin for 2018
was 2.9%, 60 basis points lower year-on-year.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, current
operating profit rose by €39 million year-
on-year after stripping out the impact of
Axione ». This improvement reflected (i) at
Bouygues Construction, another good
performance for building & civil works and a return
toa positive contribution from Bouygues Energies
& Services and (ii) at Colas, improved margins for
the roads activity in mainland France.

TF1 posted a current operating profit of
€196 million, an increase of €11 million, despite
the Soccer World Cup in 2018. Current operating
margin, including the costs of screening the
Soccer World Cup, was virtually unchanged
(down 0.1 of a point year-on-year to 8.6%).
Excluding the costs of screening the World Cup,
current operating margin is 11.7%.

Bouygues Telecom reported EBITDA of
€1,268 million in 2018, a year-on-year increase of
€171 million. EBITDA margin was 29.8%, a year-on-
year improvement of 2.8 points.

Overall, Group operating profit rose by
€257 million in 2018 to €1,776 million. It includes
€265 million of non-current income (mainly a
capital gain on the sale of mobile sites and FTTH
infrastructure at Bouygues Telecom).

In line with a dividend policy consistent

Directors will therefore ask the Annual
General Meeting of 25 April 2019 to
approve a dividend of €1.70 per share.
That represents a yield of 5.4% (dividend

2018

Net debt stood at €3,657 million as of
31 December 2018, versus €1,917 million a year
earlier. This mainly reflects recent acquisitions
(Miller McAsphalt group, aufeminin and
Alpiq Engineering Services).

Operating activities generated a net cash inflow
of €440 million in 2018, thanks to improved
profitability.

The dividend payout in 2018 was €712 million.

On 5 July 2018, Moody's upgraded its credit rating
from Baal positive to A3 stable. On 12 July 2018,
Standard & Poor's reiterated its BBB+ credit rating,
with positive outlook.

The Group has excellent liquidity (€10.0 billion
at 31 December 2018, comprising €2.7 billion
of cash and cash equivalents and €7.3 billion of
undrawn credit facilities), and a very well-spread
maturity profile.

Outlook?

The Group's activities are positioned on markets that offer opportunities
for growth:

e strong worldwide demand for complex projects, more sophisticated
and integrated offers, and maintenance;

significant appetite for premium and exclusive video content that can
be monetized via data analysis (consumption, usage, profiles, etc);

e an explosion in B2C and B2B fixed and mobile usage.

In this favourable environment, the Group can use its robust competitive

advantages to:

e in 2019, improve Group profitability and generate €300 million of
free cash flow? at Bouygues Telecom;

e within two years, increase Group free cash flow generation after WCR°
to €1 billion thanks to the contribution of the three sectors of activity.

(@) Before application of IFRS 16.

(b) Free cash flow = cash flow minus cost of net debt minus income tax expense minus net capital expenditure. It is calculated before changes in working capital

requirements (WCR).

(c) Free cash flow after WCR = cash flow minus cost of net debt minus income tax expense minus net capital expenditure. It is calculated after changes in WCR

related to operating activities and excluding 5G frequencies.

211 Profile

CONSTRUCTION BUSINESSES

Bouygues is the sixth® biggest construction group in the world. As a property developer, builder and operator, it is present in over 90 countries and draws
‘on the expertise and commitment of its almost 117,000 employees. The Group is therefore active in building and civil works, energy and services, property

development, and transport infrastructure.

Demographic growth, urbanisation and new environmental imperatives are generating significant needs worldwide in terms of complex buildings and

infrastructure. Furthermore, digitisation is transforming the way customers use technology and what they expect from it. As a result, Bouygues is in a good
position to provide full-service solutions as well as innovative and high value-added services. Its positioning and many strengths mean that it continues to

be a key partner for its customers.

Growth strategy and opportunities

¢ Controlling key resources: this enables the three construction businesses
to manage supply availability and quality, and it also leads to improved
competitiveness and margins. Aware of how important it is to safeguard
natural resources and the increasing difficulty of accessing primary
deposits, the Group is implementing a circular-economy strategy as a
way of securing supply and protecting the environment.

e Leading the markets for the construction and renovation of buildings
and infrastructure: Bouygues builds and maintains a wide range of
infrastructure designed to meet the needs arising from urbanisation and
demographic growth. This includes buildings of all sizes and uses, from
transport infrastructure to power and telecommunications networks.
Furthermore, in order to cope with ageing infrastructure, the Group has
developed expertise in renovating assets, even whilst they remain in
operation.

Helping customers control energy consumption and designing less
carbon-intensive construction methods: the Group works to optimise
the energy efficiency of structures throughout their entire lifecycle.

= During construction, customers are offered the option of bioclimatic
design, bio-sourced materials and embedded technologies generating
renewable energy from solar, wind or other sources.

= Once the asset is operational, having the ability to generate renewable
energy on-site can reduce customers’ charges and even provide income
for them.

Leading the market for urban design and development - from the
individual housing unit, to the neighbourhood and smart city: Bouygues
is a market leader in the design and development of sustainable
neighbourhoods. The Group consults customers and local people, and
works hand in hand with local stakeholders to develop projects that
promote:

= well-being,
= harmonious living (soft mobility, services, etc.),

= the safeguarding of the environment, via measures such as protecting
biodiversity, recycling waste and preserving water.

Offering customers an enhanced, personalised experience as well as
scalable products that can adapt to changing needs: the Group's strategy
is to develop a range of personalised products that better meet customers’
expectations, such as connected buildings, modular and reversible housing
units that evolve in line with occupants’ needs, as well as collaborative
and shared workspaces (Nextdoor®).

21.21 Profile

Growth strategy and opportunities

Bouygues Construction's strategy is based around three priorities:

e Using innovative products and services to establish Bouygues Construction
as a global player in places where it has a long-term presence, such
as Australia, Canada, France, the UK, Hong Kong and Switzerland. The
acquisition of Alpiq Engineering Services in Switzerland and AW Edwards
in Australia is entirely consistent with this strategy, while the acquisition
of Kraftanlagen Miinchen in Germany is an opportunity to establish the
group for the long term in a new country;

Developing exceptional projects with local partners;

e Refocusing its activities towards industry and energy and services.

More specifically, Bouygues Construction is aiming to:

expand its property development activities by drawing on its Linkcity
network;

stake out a position as a leading player in the design and operation of
smart cities;

continue to be a top-notch player in the major infrastructure market
(bridges, tunnels, concessions and PPP (public-private partnership) projects
in France and worldwide) and expand its activities in the growing market
for infrastructure repair work;

enhance its skills in industrial processes and maintenance and develop
cutting-edge skills in areas such as robotics, automation, smart buildings
and the Internet of Things;

roll out telecommunications infrastructure products and services in France
and worldwide;

continue its expansion in the solar farms segment, especially on
international markets.

In these various market segments, Bouygues Construction:

© proposes full-service offerings which meet customers’ needs, capitalising
on its knowledge of markets in key sectors such as rehabilitation, healthcare
and hotels;

© pursues customer satisfaction over the long term, in particular by ensuring
tight control over execution, high-quality products and services and after-
sales support.

The company is also investing to increase productivity and improve its
performance in the construction process.

Strengths and assets

An innovative, responsible and proactive player, Bouygues Construction has
many strengths to draw on in all its businesses:

know-how through the talent of employees in over 60 countries who
share the same customer-focused values;

end-to-end coverage of the value chain;

© a strong international presence: Bouygues Construction operates
worldwide on a long-term basis through well-established local
subsidiaries or on one-off, technically complex major projects. These two
approaches are complementary and give the company the necessary
flexibility to deploy its resources quickly on strong-potential markets.

30 » BOUYGUES + 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT

Bouygues Construction generates over half its sales on international
markets;

e distinctive, high value-added products and services based on long
experience of managing complex projects, specific knowledge of
sustainable construction and constant innovation in all its forms;

the ability to adapt to changing markets: the level of the backlog provides
good medium-term visibility, enabling costs to be adjusted while focusing
commercial investment on the most dynamic markets;

e ahigh level of cash.

Market position

Given the organisational structure of its direct competitors, it is difficult to
make like-for-like comparisons between them and Bouygues Construction.

e In the world: the Bouygues group's construction businesses arm,
represented by its three business segments, is placed sixth in the 2017
ENR ranking of international contractors published in August 2018, based
on the share of sales generated on international markets.

In Europe: based on the 2017 ranking published by trade magazine
Le Moniteur in December 2018, the Bouygues group's construction
businesses arm (Bouygues Construction, Bouygues Immobilier, Colas) is the
third largest in Europe after the Spanish firm ACS and Vinci's Contracting
and Property Development division, and ahead of the Swedish contractor
Skanska and the French contractor Eiffage.

In France: in a market worth €216 billion according to a Euroconstruct
estimate in December 2018, Bouygues Construction (its building and
civil works activities alone) is one of the top three contractors ahead of
Eiffage Construction and behind Vinci Construction (2017 ranking published
by Le Moniteur in December 2018).

21.2.2 Business activity in 2018

Record commercial performance

Exceptional order intake

Order intake in 2018 reached €14.5 billion. It included 19 contracts worth
more than €100 million, 13 of them on international markets.

In France, order intake amounted to €5.8 billion, 6% less than in 2017. The
main orders included the conversion of the 17 boulevard Morland site in Paris
into a 44,000-m? complex, the construction of Biotope, a 7-storey building
that will host the headquarters of the Lille metropolitan authority (MEL),
and a public-private partnership project for a university building on the
Paris-Saclay site.

Order intake on international markets came to €8.7 billion, 25% more than
in 2017, following the acquisition of AW Edwards and Alpiq Engineering
Services (Alpiq InTec and Kraftanlagen MUnchen). Orders included the
WestConnex tunnel in Australia, a physics laboratory for Cambridge
University, three new hotels in Cuba, a project to build an artificial island
for the tourism industry in the Bahamas, and the construction of a solar
farm in Australia.


--- Page 26 ---

A larger backlog giving long-term visibility

The backlog at end-2018 stood at a high €22.2 billion, up 5% on end-
December 2017 (up 7% at constant exchange rates and up 5% at constant
exchange rates excluding Alpiq Engineering Services, AW Edwards and
Axione), with international markets accounting for 61%. Europe and Asia-
Oceania are the two most important international regions. Orders booked
at end-2018 to be executed in 2019 amounted to €9.9 billion (€12.3 billion to
be executed after 2019), giving good visibility for future activity.

Sales driven by international markets

Sales in 2018 amounted to €12.4 billion, with building and civil works
accounting for 74% and energies and services for 26%. They were up 6%
year-on-year (up 1% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates).

Sales in France were broadly stable versus 2017 at €5.6 billion, equating
to 45% of total sales. Sales on international markets reached a record
€6.8 billion, up 11% versus 2017, due in particular to the acquisition by
Bouygues Construction of Alpiq InTec in Switzerland, Kraftanlagen Minchen
in Germany and AW Edwards in Australia.

Stable operating performance

Current operating profit rose slightly to €368 million versus €363 million
in 2017, and the current operating margin stood at 3.0%, down 0.1 points
versus 2017. This includes the €106-million capital gain on the partial disposal
of Axione (49% of the shares) to the Mirova investment fund (a BPCE
subsidiary) and the remeasurement of the residual interest in the company.
Restated for this transaction, current operating profit was €262 million
and the current operating margin 2.1%, down by 1 point year-on-year. The
building and civil works activities delivered a very good performance in 2018,
recording a 0.3-point year-on-year increase in the margin to 4.2%. Current
operating profit was hit by difficulties completing three energies and services
projects in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Two biomass power plants in the
UK experienced difficulties during the commissioning and testing phases,
related mainly to malfunctions on certain equipment, leading to delays,
additional costs and compensation paid to customers. The data centre in
Ireland, which was terminated by the client, has entered a new phase of
litigation following the client's demand for payment of the maximum amount
of compensation.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, current operating profit excluding Axione
increased as a result of the continued good performances at the building
and civil works activities and the return to a positive contribution from
Bouygues Energies & Services.

Net profit attributable to the Group came to €29%6 million.

High net surplus cash

Bouygues Construction had net surplus cash of €3.1 billion at end-2018 versus
€3.4 billion at end-2017.

Developments in Bouygues Construction's markets
and activities

Building and civil works

In 2018, sales in the building and civil works segment came to €9.2 billion,
1% more than in 2017. Sales in France accounted for 45% of the total, and
on international markets for 55%.

FRANCE

The recovery of the French construction market continued in 2018, and it is
expected to stabilise in 2019. The recovery was further boosted by public-
sector orders and business investment. The long-term prospects for the
construction market in the Paris region are sustained by the Grand Paris major
infrastructure programme and substantial needs for housing. The Grand Paris
Express rapid transit project represents civil works contracts worth more
than €30 billion over the period to 2030.

2018 sales: €4.1 billion (-2%)

Bouygues Construction handed over large-scale projects in the Paris region
in 2018, such as the Batignolles development in Paris, and continued work on
other major amenity projects such as 3 Fontaines shopping centre at Cergy
and the rehabilitation of the Louvre Post Office and Commodities Exchange
buildings in Paris. It also carried out substantial civil engineering projects
which, through Grand Paris initiatives (packages T2A and T3A of Line 15 South
and Line 14 of the Paris metro), will improve the transport environment in
the Paris region. In the commercial property segment, work continued on
the Tour Alto tower in the La Défense business district and on the Bridge
building, Orange's future headquarters in Issy-les-Moulineaux.

The company continued its activity in the public sector, starting work on the
Biotope project in Lille, which will host the headquarters of Lille Metropolitan
authority (MEL), and building the CO'Met sports and entertainment complex
in Orleans.

Major projects handed over in 2018 included Terminal 1 of Lyon Saint-Exupéry
airport and a carbon-fibre production site for Hexcel in south-east France.
In civil works, Bouygues Construction continued work on complex major
projects, including civil engineering for the viaduct of the New Coastal Road
on Reunion Island and for the Port of Calais. Work also continued on Line T2
of the Nice tramway. In addition, regional branches all over France specialise
in smaller-scale civil engineering projects and earthworks.

EUROPE

The construction market in Europe grew by more than 3% in 2018, slightly
less than in 2017 (4%).

The main drivers of construction at present are the economic recovery,
growing urbanisation and catch-up investment after several years of under-
spending following the 2008 financial crisis.

In Western Europe, Bouygues Construction subsidiaries are particularly active
in the UK and Switzerland. The construction market in the UK has stabilised

despite the uncertainties over Brexit. The construction market in Switzerland,
long driven by the building segment, is a little less dynamic.

2018 sales: €2.0 billion (-4%)

In the UK, Bouygues Construction's activity was underpinned by major
housing projects such as the Canning Town urban regeneration project in
London. It completed construction of the Manhattan Loft Gardens tower
in Stratford.

In the education sector, Bouygues Construction took orders for two major
new projects, Cardiff University's Innovation Campus, which is planned to
include two research centres, and Cavendish Lab Ill for Cambridge University.

The company also carried out civil engineering work on the Hinkley Point EPR
nuclear power plant, which on completion will meet 7% of the UK's power
consumption needs and supply over five million households.

In Switzerland, Bouygues Construction drew on its expertise in managing
complex property development projects, increasingly at the entire
neighbourhood level, as exemplified by Les Jardins du Couchant in Nyon
and the Erlenmatt and Greencity eco-neighbourhoods in Basel and Zurich
respectively.

In Central Europe, Bouygues Construction has a number of local building
subsidiaries in Poland and the Czech Republic.

Elsewhere in Europe, Bouygues Construction is also involved on a one-
off basis in major infrastructure projects. The confinement shelter for the
damaged nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine was completed in late 2018
and work continued on a complex offshore extension project in Monaco.

ASIA AND OCEANIA

Growth rates on Asian markets remained high, partly driven by China, which is
on the way to becoming the world's largest economy. Hong Kong, Singapore
and Myanmar continue to exhibit strong potential.

In Australia, housing and retail construction and public investment in
healthcare are driving the building market. The infrastructure construction
market is likely to remain strong, sustained by government spending,
especially on roads and telecommunications.

2018 sales: €2.1 billion (+12%)

Bouygues Construction capitalises on its strong local presence in the
Asia - Oceania region, especially in Hong Kong, where it has been a player for
over 60 years. Several major projects are under construction there, including
the sub-sea Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok road tunnel and two twin-tube tunnels
for the extension of the Shatin to Central Link metro line. The Hong Kong-
Zhuhai-Macao bridge was handed over in October 2018.

Bouygues Construction is a recognised player on the Asian building market,
especially for high-rise structures. In Singapore, the company continued work
‘on the Project Glory mixed-use complex and took an order for a complex
of six 15-storey buildings. In Bangkok, work continued on one of the two
buildings of The Esse at Singha Complex, a new condominium in the city
centre.

32 * BOUYGUES + 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT

In Myanmar, Bouygues Construction continued work on the second phase
of the Yoma Central multi-use residential complex.

In Australia, Bouygues Construction continued work on the Melbourne metro
as part of a consortium with Lendlease, John Holland and Capella Capital.
Its acquisition of AW Edwards will strengthen the company's activity in the
country through the construction of public amenities like Blacktown Hospital
in Sydney.

AFRICA ~ MIDDLE EAST

High levels of economic growth are expected in Africa, linked in particular
to rapid urbanisation, though the geopolitical context remains fragile. In
the Middle East, the economic situation is highly dependent on the price of
oil. However, transport infrastructure needs and the exploitation of natural
resources make these high-potential regions for construction firms.

2018 sales: €536 million (-9%)

In Africa, Bouygues Constructions local subsidiaries work on infrastructure
projects. In Egypt, after taking part in the construction of Lines 1 and 2 of the
Cairo metro, the company is building the new phase of Line 3.

The company's expertise in earthworks for opencast mining is illustrated in
its operation of gold mines at Kibali in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Tongon in Ivory Coast and Gounkoto in Mali. Bouygues Construction is also
involved on a one-off basis in roadbuilding projects in other African countries.

In the Middle East, the company is building sewage tunnels in Doha, Qatar.

AMERICAS - CARIBBEAN

There are opportunities in the Americas, especially the United States and
Canada, as a result of the public authorities’ stated intention of rebuilding
infrastructure. The growth of tourism in the region also potentially opens
up attractive opportunities for Bouygues Construction.

2018 sales: €335 million (+46%)

The Americas - Caribbean region is growing strongly. Bouygues Construction
has a long-term presence in Cuba, where it is a recognised specialist in the
construction of turnkey luxury hotel complexes, a growing market because
of the steady growth of tourism. In the Bahamas, Bouygues Construction
started work on Ocean Cay, a 100-acre artificial island. In the United States,
work continued on “Arte by Antonio Citterio", a luxury residential complex
in Florida.

Energies and Services

An Energies and Services division incorporating Bouygues Energies & Services
was created in 2018 following the acquisition of Alpiq InTec and Kraftanlagen
Munchen. It will benefit from the energy-sector expertise of the two newly
acquired businesses, in electrical and HVAC engineering and power-plant
development respectively.


--- Page 28 ---

The Energies & Service division has three main business lines:
e network infrastructure;

e facilities management;

e and electrical and HVAC engineering.

There is growing demand in industry for cutting-edge expertise in areas
such as robotisation and smart buildings, as well as for complex processes
and industrial maintenance. In addition, environmental issues, demographic
growth and increasingly scarce raw materials make energy efficiency in
buildings a central concern. Telecommunications needs are also driving
rising demand for network infrastructure. These key trends on the energy
and services markets offer the Energies & Services division sources of growth,
both in the countries where it has most of its operations (Canada, France, the
UK and Switzerland) and in emerging countries, especially in Asia and Africa.

The Energies & Services activity generated sales of €3.2 billion in 2018.

FRANCE

2018 sales: €1.4 billion (+9%)

In late 2018, the Mirova? investment fund acquired a 49% stake in Axione.
With its 51% interest, Bouygues Energies & Services remains Axione's core
shareholder and will continue to provide it with operational support. This
strategic alliance will help create a leader in mobile and very-high-speed
fixed infrastructure (investment, roll-out, maintenance and operation) in
France and abroad.

In electrical and HVAC engineering, Bouygues Energies & Services provided
mechanical and electrical equipment for the L2 Marseille bypass and carried
out electrical engineering work for the rehabilitation of la Samaritaine in Paris.
The company is also responsible for installing electrical and HVAC systems
at the new Sanofi production facility at Val-de-Reuil in north-western France.

Within public-private partnerships, Bouygues Energies & Services continued
to provide maintenance services for the Paris law courts building, the Paris
zoo and the French Defence Ministry in Paris. It also continued the street-
lighting contract with the Municipality of Paris, as part of a consortium.

As part ofa consortium including EDF subsidiary Citelum, Suez and Capgemini,
Bouygues Energies & Services is overseeing the design, construction and
operation of France's first smart-city project in Dijon. The 12-year contract
covers the management of a connected control station for public facilities
serving the 250,000 people who live in the Dijon metropolitan area.

2018 sales: €1.7 billion (+39%)

Following the acquisition in 2018 of the Swiss company Alpiq InTec and the
German company Kraftanlagen Miinchen, Bouygues Construction extended
its presence in Switzerland and Northern Italy and established a foothold
in Germany.

Bouygues Energies & Services is an expert in major turnkey power grid
infrastructure projects, for example in Australia, where it recently completed
the construction of two solar farms.

In Africa, Bouygues Energies & Services is involved in power transport and
distribution, mainly in Ivory Coast.

It has a facilities management (FM) business in Europe, with contracts for
the offices of Crédit Suisse in Switzerland and for many public amenities in
the UK, including hospitals, schools and the Home Office. It was awarded
two significant street-lighting contracts there, in the Oxford region and in
the borough of Lambeth, London.

In Canada, Bouygues Energies & Services provides FM for Surrey Hospital
and the RCMP headquarters and is expanding on the electrical engineering
market via its Plan Group subsidiary, which has built the country's first smart
hospital, Mackenzie Vaughan Hospital, in the greater Toronto region.

FM contracts, both in France and elsewhere, guarantee Bouygues Energies
& Services recurring long-term revenue streams.

21.3.1 Profile

Growth strategy

Bouygues Immobilier is consolidating its position as an urban developer/
operator, basing its future growth on three strategic priorities.

A premium, use-centred customer experience

A successful customer experience is central to Bouygues Immobilier's
strategy, driven by three concerns:

e areinvigorated purchasing process: the purchasing process for residential
properties was fully overhauled with the roll-out of a new "BI Store" sales
space concept featuring a warm and friendly atmosphere designed
to help customers better buy into their home acquisition project and
forge strong links with them. In 2018, Bouygues Immobilier introduced a
customer relationship management (CRM) system - a digital platform that
allows customers to choose customised services, fixtures and fittings, and
measures their satisfaction once they have settled into their new home;

personalised homes with built-in modularity and innovation: launched
in 2016, the Flexom service package for connected and smart homes is
integrated into 13,000 properties, 4,000 of which were handed over in 2018.
In 2018, Bouygues Immobilier also launched "Entre Voisins", a social media
app that helps to create a friendly atmosphere in apartment buildings by
encouraging residents to exchange services. Bouygues Immobilier has
also speeded up the digitisation of its customer experience, introducing a
number of innovations including a 3D immersive visit of a show apartment
that enables customers to choose their options early in the process and a
configurator that shows the price and dimensions of their chosen options;

workplaces adapted to new approaches: Bouygues Immobilier is
responding to the new challenges of the changing workplace (reversibility,
well-being in the workplace, control over energy use and coworking) with
its three commercial property packages; Green Office, Rehagreen and
Nextdoor. Its strategy is to:

maintain its leading position in the positive-energy segment with Green
Office. Nearly ten years after the launch of the Green Office positive-
energy office building? concept, some 20 Green Office projects had

Sustainable development: from single buildings
to neighbourhoods

In 2011, Bouygues Immobilier created UrbanEra, a division dedicated to the
design of sustainable and mixed-use neighbourhoods. The aim is to design
mixed-use neighbourhoods with a cohesive identity and to create value for
all those involved, whether residents, not-for-profit organisations, employees,
entrepreneurs, investors, local authorities, local politicians or development
agencies. Several neighbourhoods had already been completed by the
end of 2018, such as Ginko, Fort d'Issy and Font-Pré, inaugurated in Toulon
in April 2017. Several more are being developed, such as Coeur Université in
Nanterre, Eureka Confluence in Lyon, Etoile in Annemasse and Les Fabriques
in Marseille.

In early 2018, UrbanEra was selected to develop the Charenton-Bercy project,
on the eastern edge of Paris, through the call for bids called “Invent the Grand
Paris metropolitan area"®. The ambitious 360,000-m? development designed
by the urban planning and architecture firms Ateliers 2/3/4/ and SOM will
breathe new life into the urban brownfield site and boost its economic, urban,
residential and cultural appeal. Features will include a 180-metre tall ‘green’
high-rise building and a business hub dedicated to virtual technologies such
as video games and medical imaging.

Acompany being transformed

Digitisation is transforming the property development business and is now
central to new uses. Bouygues Immobilier was quick to understand the far-
reaching implications of these changes and aims to constantly stay ahead
of the curve.

Bouygues Immobilier is continuing to implement the collaborative BIM
(Building Information Modelling) ° process with the aim of integrating BIM
into the design and production of all its developments by 2021.

Having created Bird, a subsidiary that invests in start-ups specialising in
property development, in 2015, Bouygues Immobilier has since acquired
stakes in eight innovative new businesses.

In 2018, Bouygues Immobilier also set up a Partnerships and Services division
to expand the company's urban, B2B and B2C services such as residences
for senior citizens (Les Jardins d'Arcadie), coworking spaces (Nextdoor),
guaranteed building charges (Aveltys) and smart grids (Embix).

In 2018, Bouygues Immobilier also opened Valorissimo, a digital platform
that enables financial advisors to reserve residential properties directly with
other developers, with the aim of becoming one of the leading platforms
on the market.

Strengths and assets

Bouygues Immobilier enjoys several competitive advantages in a slightly
shrinking market:

e extensive geographical coverage: the company has 39 branches in

France, which keep it close to customers and strengthen its ties with
local stakeholders;

(b) Europe's largest international call for tenders in the field of property development, urban planning and architecture.

(c) Digital modelling and management of the data involved in order to design, build and operate buildings more quickly and efficiently. Using augmented and
virtual reality functions, BIM helps to anticipate the requirements inherent in new buildings. Its logistics features make it easier to start up a worksite and operate
it throughout the construction process, in compliance with a sustainable construction approach. It has been proven in several depollution and deconstruction

projects (see Chapter 3 of this document)

e a wide and diversified range of residential products and services,
including affordable and intermediate housing for owner-occupiers, buy-
to-let properties, student and senior citizen accommodation, single-family
homes, etc.;

a perfect match between the new expectations of business customers
and its commercial property products, such as turnkey buildings, Green
Office positive-energy buildings, Rehagreen? office building rehabilitation,
and Nextdoor innovative, flexible and collaborative workspaces;

acknowledged expertise in sustainable neighbourhoods: with UrbanEra,
Bouygues Immobilier supports local authorities with their development
projects over the long term, offering a wide range of services to improve
quality of life for residents;

a proactive open innovation policy, including organised identification of
start-ups, intrapreneurship, co-development of operational projects and
equity interests in start-ups specialising in property development via Bird,
an investment subsidiary;

e a robust business model that gives priority to risk management and
guarantees a healthy financial structure for the company.

Market position

With a market share of 9.7%, Bouygues Immobilier is one of France's
leading residential property developers, behind Nexity but ahead of its
other main rivals such as Alterea Cogedim, Kaufman & Broad, and Icade. A
benchmark player in the commercial property segment, Bouygues Immobilier
differentiates itself from its main competitors (BNP Paribas Immobilier,
Sogeprom, Nexity and Alterea Cogedim) by offering innovative environmental
products (Green Office and Rehagreen) and by positioning itself as a
pioneer in new ways of working (Nextdoor). At neighbourhood level,
Bouygues Immobilier has confirmed its leading position in sustainable urban
development with its UrbanEra service package.

21.3.2 Business activity in 2018

In 2018, the amount of Bouygues Immobilier's reservations stood at
€2,614 million, down 15% versus 2017. The backlog at end-December 2018
stood at €2,478 million, down 9% year-on-year. Reservations in France
represented 96% of the order book at end-December 2018.

In this context, Bouygues Immobilier generated sales of €2,628 million, 4%
less than in the previous year.

Residential property sales amounted to €2,364 million, down 2% on 2017,
and commercial property sales to €264 million, down 22% on 2017 due to
the postponement of some developments to 2019.

Current operating profit amounted to €188 million. It represented 7.2%
of sales, versus 7.9% in 2017 (6.9% excluding the capital gain on Nextdoor
in 2017).

Net profit attributable to the Group amounted to €138 million, up 10% year-
on-year.

Shareholders' equity stood at €608 million.
Bouygues Immobilier had net debt of €238 million at 31 December 2018.

Developments in Bouygues Immobilier's markets
and activities

Residential property

A DECLINE IN RESERVATIONS

The French residential property market contracted by around 2% in 2018,
with 127,964 housing units sold compared with 130,074 in 2017. The decline,
which mostly concerned private investors acquiring buy-to-let properties,
was confirmed over the year despite:

e the extension for another four years of Pinel buy-to-let incentives in areas
around major cities where rental housing is scarce;

e the zero-interest loan programme, adjusted in 2016 and extended for four
years in areas where the pressure on housing is high and for two years
in areas where it is not. However, the maximum share of the transaction
cost covered by the zero-interest loan was reduced from 40% to 20%
where the loan is intended to finance the purchase or construction of
new housing in low-pressure areas;

e still highly attractive mortgage interest rates.

In this slightly declining market, Bouygues Immobilier took reservations
for 13,449 residential property units in 2018, a decrease of 12% versus 2017,
equating to €2,337 million (down 11% year-on-year).

In France, this figure was 12,467 units in 2018, down 11% mainly due to a lack
of supply, especially in the first half of the year. Block reservations declined
significantly, from 4,410 in 2017 to 3,490 in 2018, a fall of 21%. Unit reservations
fell 7%, from 9,669 in 2017 to 8,977 in 2018.

DIVERSIFICATION AND PRODUCT CUSTOMISATION

Bouygues Immobilier constantly diversifies its property portfolio and
offers several types of multi-unit housing (for owner-occupiers or buy-to-
let investors, at below market prices, intermediate and social housing), as
well as single-family houses and serviced residences for senior citizens and
students. Among the highlights of 2018, Bouygues Immobilier inaugurated the
Kley student halls of residence in Marseille (340 rooms from the conversion
of an office property), which is helping in the regeneration of an entire
district. Font-Pré, with its 10,000 m? of green spaces, modular housing units,
aLes Jardins d'Arcadie senior citizens residence, shops and local services,
is the first neighbourhood in Toulon to factor in environmental, social and
societal concerns by ensuring that innovation serves the interests of residents.
Follement Gerland, a 650-unit development in Lyon handed over in 2018, is a
benchmark for services and events, encouraging residents to meet and share
through features such as a recycling facility and a bed-and breakfast service.

Commercial property

GREEN PROPERTY AND NEW WORKSPACES: A WINNING STRATEGY

Despite the French economy picking up again and business confidence
returning, in 2018 the commercial property market in the Paris region fell by
5% in comparison with 2017, with 2.5 million m? taken up. After growing in
the first and second quarters (up 7% vs Q1 2017 and up 32% vs Q2 2017), it
contracted in the third and fourth quarters (down 18% vs Q3 2017 and down
27% vs Q4 2017) (source: Immostat).

(a) Based on a comprehensive multi-criteria assessment of the building, covering technical, energy, planning, regulatory, commercial and other aspects, the purpose
of the Rehagreen service is to identify and implement the rehabilitation scenario which most precisely meets the owner's enhancement objectives and the
demands of the commercial property market, while respecting the building's architectural heritage.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Construction businesses * Bouygues Immobilier

The investment market in the Paris region ended 2018 on a high note, with
over €10 billion invested in the fourth quarter. As a result of this record final
quarter, the amount invested in the Paris region in 2018 reached a new record
level of €23.1 billion, 19% more than in 2017 (source: JLL).

The value of commercial property (office and retail space) reservations
fell 35% year-on-year to €277 million, due to the postponement of some
developments to 2019.

Bouygues Immobilier's commercial property strategy in 2018 focused on
the following priorities:

Green Office positive-energy office buildings

Green Office buildings produce more energy than they consume while
ensuring maximum comfort for users. Projects completed in 2018 included the
En Seine and Vogue Green Office complex in Meudon, a virtuous combination
of housing, shops and offices with two Green Office buildings. En Seine
will be fitted with 560 m? of solar panels. In 2018, the Enjoy Green Office
building in Paris, the largest positive-energy office building (17,400 m?) to
be awarded the BBCA low-carbon label, was handed over to AXA. XPole,
Schneider Electric's future headquarters in Grenoble, the structural works
for which were completed in 2018, will be a 4.0 building, innovative, open
and flexible.

Rehabilitation with Rehagreen

Rehagreen enhances the value of existing property assets.
Bouygues Immobilier's target over the 2016-2020 period is for Rehagreen
rehabilitation projects to account for 35% of its commercial property space
in progress or completed.

A flagship example of this approach is SWAYS (Smart ways to work), a
convivial and connected smart building in Issy-Les-Moulineaux which aims
to make everyday life easier for both the building's users and the Issy-Val
de Seine business district as a whole. Offering 42,000 m? of office space,
the project will be handed over in late 2020.

Nextdoor coworking spaces

Nextdoor has been in existence for only three years but has already staked
out a place for itself, opening ten sites with over 5,000 occupants at the
end of 2018.

Sustainable urban development

Since its creation the UrbanEra division, working in tandem with all the
other business segments, has overseen the development of more than
1,000,000 m’ of new urban projects representing 950,000 m’ of living space
or 17,000 housing units.

NANTERRE CCEUR UNIVERSITE DISTRICT

In 2017, UrbanEra acquired the land for the last two phases of the Nanterre
Coeur Université development. Nearly 500 housing units will be handed over
between 2019 and 2020, together with two Green Office buildings, shops,
a cinema and a public car park with around 700 spaces. Nanterre Coeur
Université will be one of the first neighbourhoods in France to be awarded
the BiodiverCity? Aménagement label.

CCEUR GINKO IN BORDEAUX

The fourth phase of Ginko is now under way. A mixed-use complex is due
to be handed over in early 2020, comprising a 1,500-space underground
car park and a 25,000-m’ retail centre over which 699 residential units will
be built, including short-stay business apartments. The fourth phase will
comprise 25 buildings in all.

CHARENTON-BERCY

In 2018, through the call for bids called "Invent the Grand Paris metropolitan
Area", UrbanEra was selected to develop the 360,000-m? Charenton-Bercy
project in the east of Paris. Ambitious in terms not only of economic and
residential development but also of architectural and environmental design,
its identity will be strongly marked by a 180-metre "green" high-rise building
and a cluster dedicated to virtual worlds. Work is due to start in 2021, with
the first buildings being handed over in 2024.

ANNEMASSE

The Etoile Annemasse-Genéve mixed-use development zone is a 19-hectare
eco-neighbourhood project initiated by the Annemasse metropolitan
authority. Located in the heart of the Genevois conurbation spanning the
border between France and Switzerland, it is being developed by UrbanEra
in the municipalities of Ambilly, Annemasse and Ville-la~Grand. The arrival of
the Léman Express (a Franco-Swiss rapid transit system) in December 2019
will offer exceptional conditions of access to the centre of Annemasse,
Geneva airport and the new mixed-use neighbourhood, which covers
around 165,000 m?.

LES FABRIQUES IN MARSEILLE

2018 saw the inauguration of Europe's largest collaborative & socially
responsible makerspace in Europe, in the heart of the future Les Fabriques
eco-neighbourhood in Marseille. The 3,500-m? space is made available to
ICI Marseille by UrbanEra and Linkcity, the project's operators, to house
a community of artisans, artists, designers and entrepreneurs. Aiming to
promote sharing and foster skills in a friendly atmosphere, the space offers
makers shared workshops that combine cutting-edge equipment (3D printers,
laser cutters, etc.) with traditional tools.

International

Bouygues Immobilier's international business remained strong in 2018 with
the reservation of nearly 1,000 residential properties. In Poland, in a thriving
market sustained by full employment and increased purchasing power,
Bouygues Immobilier consolidated its position as a nationwide benchmark
property developer. After Warsaw, Wroctaw and Krakow, a fourth branch
was opened in Poznan in 2018.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

21.41 Profile

With 800 profit centres and 2,000 materials production units (quarries,
emulsion factories, asphalt mix and ready-mix concrete plants, bitumen
production units) in over 50 countries around the world, Colas completes
more than 85,000 projects every year. In addition, it recovers and recycles
waste and deconstruction materials from the construction industry and
other sectors for use in its worksites. Colas is one of the world's top five
recyclers across all sectors, recycling 15 million tonnes of materials a year.

Activities

Roads

Each year, Colas builds and/or maintains roads and motorways, as well as
airport runways, ports, industrial, logistics and commercial hubs, external
works and amenities, reserved-lane public transport (bus lanes and tram
lines), recreational facilities and environmental projects. It also has a civil
engineering activity spanning both small and large projects, and a marginal
building activity.

Construction materials

Upstream of roadbuilding, Colas has a significant presence in the production,
sale and recycling of construction materials (aggregates, emulsions, asphalt
mixes, ready-mix concrete, bitumen) through an extensive international
network of 475 quarries and gravel pits (of which 86 partly-owned by Colas),
150 emulsion plants, 589 asphalt plants, 206 ready-mix concrete plants
and one bitumen production plant®. Colas also has a significant bitumen
distribution activity supplied by 79 bitumen terminals.

Railways
The Railways activity (Colas Rail) comprises the design and engineering of

complex, large-scale projects and the construction, renewal and maintenance
of rail networks (conventional and high-speed lines, trams and metro systems).

Other activities
Colas is also present in the following activities:

Road safety and signalling (Aximum), which consists in the manufacture,
installation and maintenance of road safety equipment, road markings and
traffic signs, as well as traffic management and access control equipment;

Growth strategies and opportunities

Colas' business development strategy is based on providing worldwide
collective expertise in order to drive strong brand and profit growth.

This overall strategy is built on four strategic priorities:

promoting industrial activities, especially aggregates and bitumen, in
a socially and environmentally responsible way in order to control the
availability and quality of sourced materials and improve competitiveness;

e enhancing the range of products and services in two areas: complex,
large-scale projects for major public- or private-sector customers, and
new and innovative business lines and services focusing on customer
demand for responsible mobility;

e continuing targeted international expansion, mainly through external
growth in low-risk countries, in order to establish and consolidate leading
positions on local markets and capitalise on geographical diversification
to help spread risk;

e accelerating digital transformation in processes, industries and new
businesses in order to improve competitiveness and the quality of service
provision and offer new services.

Strengths and assets

Colas operates on markets with long-term growth prospects all over the
world, driven by population growth, urbanisation, substantial infrastructure
needs in emerging countries, recurring renewal of existing infrastructure in
developed countries, environmental challenges, the spread of new forms
of mobility and the digital revolution.

Colas' main strengths are:

e worldwide collective expertise drawing on almost 58,000 employees
who share a common history and values, especially safety, ethics and
respect for the environment, and a strong brand;

a capacity for innovation, backed up by a Campus for Science and
Techniques, which designs and develops products and technologies
that meet the challenges of the energy transition and new uses; in digital
transformation, “Mobility by Colas" is a mobility services activator which
is developing a digital offering for new uses and services;

vertical integration, with an international network of 2,000 sites producing
and recycling construction materials (aggregates, bitumen emulsions,
asphalt mixes, etc.), as well as bitumen plants, which give the company
control over the value chain upstream, especially its environmental impacts;

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Construction businesses * Colas

e a decentralised organisation through a network of 800 profit centres
around the world staffed by long-standing local teams accustomed to local
particularities and used to working on the small upkeep and development
projects which account for most of the over 85,000 projects completed
each year; a special division, Colas Projects, also supports subsidiaries in
the design and construction of major projects;

e a robust financial structure and ability to generate cash flow, which
enable the Colas group to pursue further growth by continuing to invest
in targeted assets.

Market position

Roads, mainland France: Colas is a leading player on a par with Eurovia
(Vinci) and Eiffage Travaux Publics (Eiffage group). It is also in competition
with large nationwide French firms (NGE, Malet), regional firms (Ramery,
Charrier, Pigeon) and an extensive network of small and medium-
sized regional and local firms. Cement makers are competitors on the
markets for aggregates and ready-mix concrete. In North America, Colas
competes with local, regional and national firms as well as subsidiaries
of multinationals. Colas has prime positions in the roadbuilding sector in
most of the other countries where it operates, its main competitors being
domestic players or subsidiaries of large international firms.

Railways: Colas' main competitors in France are ETF (Eurovia), TSO (NGE),
TGS (Alstom) and Eiffage Rail. In the UK, Colas Rail’s main competitors are
Balfour Beatty, Babcock, VolkerWessels, Vinci, Skanska, BAM and Ferrovial.

Other activities: its main competitors are Soprema in the waterproofing
sector, Signature (Eurovia), Agilis (NGE), AER (Eiffage), Girod and Lacroix
in road safety and signalling, and Spiecapag, Sicim, Bonatti, Ponticelli,
Endel and Eiffel (Eiffage) for networks.

214.2 Business activity in 2018

Colas reported sales of €13,190 million in 2018, up 13% on 2017 (up 5% like-
for-like and at constant exchange rates). This rise reflects an increase in
activity, driven by the acquisition of the Miller McAsphalt group in Canada
and good growth in the roads business in mainland France and Europe. Sales
rose 6% in France and 20% on international markets (up 5% like-for-like and
at constant exchange rates). International sales amounted to €6,730 million,
51% of the total, exceeding sales in France (€6,460 million, 49% of the total)
for the first time.

Sales in the roads activity were up 16% (up 7% like-for-like and at constant
exchange rates). Sales rose in mainland France, Europe (excluding France),
driven by strong growth in both the British Isles and continental Europe,
North America due to the integration of the Miller McAsphalt group in Canada,
Oceania, French overseas departments and regions, and the Indian Ocean.
They fell in Africa. The sales of specialised activities were down slightly by 2%
(down 5% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates). Sales fell in Railways
(lower sales in France) and Networks, remained stable in Waterproofing and
increased in Road Safety and Signalling.

42 + BOUYGUES + 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT

Current operating profit amounted to €359 million, compared with
€362 million in 2017, a reduction of €3 million. The improvement in current
operating profit in the roads activity in mainland France and the contribution
of the Miller McAsphalt group was offset by a weaker performance by existing
subsidiaries in North America, mainly due to poor weather on the east coast of
the United States and markets under pressure in certain States and provinces.
The decline in current operating profit in Railways and other specialised
activities was primarily caused by Colas Rail's difficulties in its activities in
France. The current operating margin was 2.7% in 2018 versus 3.1% in 2017.

Non-current operating charges amounted to €31 million in 2018, mainly
related to the dismantling of the Dunkirk refinery and the one-off year-
end bonus, versus €5 million in 2017 related to preliminary works for the
dismantling of the Dunkirk site.

Operating profit therefore amounted to €328 million versus €357 million
in 2017, down €29 million.

The cost of net debt rose by €17 million to €31 million mainly due to the
acquisition of the Miller McAsphalt group.

Income tax in 2018 came to €96 million versus €75 million in 2017, an increase
of €21 million. The tax charge in 2017 benefited from tax reforms in the
United States and the partial resolution of a dispute with the tax authorities
in Canada.

The contribution of joint ventures and associates amounted to €28 million,
compared with €61 million in 2017. The €33-million decline was mainly due
to a fall in the contribution of Tipco Asphalt caused by difficulties sourcing
crude oil in the early part of the year and lower output from the Kemaman
refinery in Malaysia.

Net profit attributable to the Group amounted to €226 million in 2018, down
€102 million versus 2017.

Net cash flow came to €665 million, down €10 million versus 2017. Free cash
flow improved by €57 million to €377 million.

Net cash used in fixed assets fell by €43 million year-on-year to €300 million
in 2018. While gross capital expenditure increased by €19 million to
€462 million, disposals increased by €86 million to €174 million in 2018.
Disposals in 2018 included the sale and leaseback at Colas Rail of
67 locomotives in France and the UK.

2018 was a record year for net cash used in financial assets, with a total
of €720 million versus €79 million in 2017. The two main transactions of
the year were Colas Canada's acquisition of the Miller McAsphalt group for
€555 million and Colas Rail's acquisition of Alpiq Engineering Services' rail
activities for €118 million.

Shareholders' equity remained stable at €2.8 billion at year-end; net debt
at end-December 2018 was €517 million compared to net surplus cash of
€433 million at end-December 2017.

Roads
(2018 sales: €11,177 million)

Sales were 16% higher than in 2017 (up 7% like-for-like and at constant
exchange rates).

Roads mainland France (2018 sales: €4,731 million)

Sales in 2018 were up 10% versus 2017, in line with growth in the market.
Subsidiaries put in a satisfactory performance in terms of activity despite many
disrupting factors such as bad weather, high bitumen prices and sourcing
difficulties, strikes and demonstrations. Municipalities continued to launch new
projects such as trams (Angers, Saint-Etienne, technopole Sofia Antipolis, etc.)
and bus rapid transit (BRT) corridors (Cannes, Saint-Brieuc, etc.). Activity was
also boosted by a motorway upgrade plan and the Grand Paris Express rapid
transport project (metro Line 16, T4 tram line). This was complemented by a
slight upturn in private investment. Diversification by subsidiaries into areas
such as works for private individuals under the specific "Colas & Vous" brand
name, depollution, trading in civil works products, recycling and elimination
of construction waste also helped to boost sales.

Roads Europe (2018 sales: €1,840 million)

Sales were 15% higher than in 2017 (up 14% like-for-like and at constant
exchange rates).

In the British Isles, sales were up 16% versus 2017 (up 17% like-for-like and
at constant exchange rates). Higher activity in the UK was driven by the
many capital spending plans launched by the UK government, despite a
fiercely competitive environment. The integration of Allied Infrastructure
Management Ltd, an airport maintenance and service provider, continued
satisfactorily. Activity in Ireland rose in a favourable economic environment.

Sales also rose in Continental Europe (up 14%, and up 13% like-for-like and
at constant exchange rates). Activity was sustained by major road and
motorway projects in Central Europe financed by EU funds under the 2017-
2020 plan. In Hungary, major road and motorway projects awarded in 2017
(M25, M30 and M70) are under construction. In the Czech Republic, the
contracts to widen and strengthen the D1 motorway are being carried out.
Activity held up well in Poland, was strong in Iceland, increased in Belgium,
stabilised in Switzerland and declined in Denmark.

Roads North America (2018 sales: €3,341 million)

Sales were up 32% versus 2017 (down 1% like-for-like and at constant
exchange rates).

In the United States, where federal investment is supplemented by initiatives
financed by individual States, sales were up slightly by 1% versus 2017 like-for-
like and at constant exchange rates, factoring in higher prices for oil products,
especially bitumen. Activity was hard hit by poor weather, especially on the
east coast, and by tight market conditions in certain States. The roadworks
and materials production companies SERB, in Alaska, and ASA Asphalt, in
Missouri, were acquired.

In Canada, where the economy slowed slightly after a year of recovery, the
market was broadly stable and fiercely competitive. The level of roadbuilding
activity differed across the country, rising in Quebec and British Columbia,
stable in Ontario and falling in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The bitumen
distribution business benefited from a favourable market in the east of the
country (Ontario and Quebec), but conditions were tougher in the west.
The sharp rise in Colas Canada's sales versus 2017 (up 89%) was due to
the major contribution made by the road construction company Miller and
the bitumen distribution company McAsphalt. The acquisition, completed
on 28 February 2018, expands Colas Canada's geographical coverage by
strengthening its presence in Ontario and considerably increasing its bitumen
storage capacity across Canada. The integration of Miller and McAsphalt is
making good progress.

Roads "Rest of the world" (2018 sales: € 1,265 million)

Sales were up 4% versus 2017 (up 8% like-for-like and at constant exchange
rates):

sales increased 14% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates in the
French overseas departments and regions and in the Indian Ocean.
Activity remained at a generally low level in the Caribbean-French
Guiana zone, where Martinique in particular was hit by the suspension of
investment in new-build and maintenance projects. On Reunion Island,
against a background of economic difficulty and social unrest at the end
of the year and in a market under pressure, activity remained stable in
the traditional public works, civil engineering and building business, while
construction work continued on the elevated sections of the New Coastal
Road. Activity rose sharply in Madagascar, driven by construction work
and resurfacing of runways at Antananarivo and Nosy Be airports and by
private building projects.

in Africa and the Middle East, sales were down 13% like-for-like and at
constant exchange rates. The subsidiary in Morocco maintained its market
share in a fiercely competitive market. In West and Central Africa, the level
of activity differed from one country to another: work started on projects
in Ivory Coast, other projects were completed in Gabon and in Guinea,
while activity was dormant in Benin and Togo. Activity in Southern and
Eastern Africa, centred on the manufacture and sale of emulsions, fell
sharply against a background of political and economic uncertainty in
South Africa. In the Middle East (United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar),
where subsidiaries are consolidated by the equity method, activity likewise
fell sharply in a particularly difficult political and economic environment.

sales rose 20% in Asia, Australia and New Caledonia. In Asia, the activity
of the subsidiary Tipco, which is focused on the production, distribution
and sale of bitumen products, is consolidated using the equity method.
Activity in Australia (roadworks and the sale of bitumen and emulsions)
held up well in a favourable economic environment.

Railways and other Specialised activities
(2018 sales: €1,989 million)

Sales by Railways and other Specialised activities were 2% lower than in 2017
(down 5% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates).

© Railways: sales were €911 million, down slightly by 3% (down 9% like-for-like
and at constant exchange rates), with international markets accounting
for nearly two-thirds of the total. Sales fell in France, mainly because of
strikes at French railway operator SNCF on the tracklaying and freight
activities. The metro and tram activity was boosted by ongoing work on

a number of projects in Paris and the Paris region, Bordeaux and Rennes
among others, offsetting the fall in activity due to the completion of high-
speed rail projects. A number of metro and tram contracts were won. The
level of activity in the UK was high on a still-strong railway market. Lundy
Projects, a specialist in catenary systems, joined Colas Rail UK as part of
the acquisition of Alpiq Engineering Services' railway activities in July 2018.

In the rest of the world, sales fell back slightly (excluding the integration
of recently acquired subsidiaries). Activity fell in the Middle East/Africa
zone following completion of the Tangiers-Kenitra high-speed rail link,
and in South America due to the halting of the Caracas metro project and
completion of Line 3 of the Santiago metro in Chile. It rose in Asia as work
continued on Line 3 of the Hanoi metro and started on the Jakarta MRT
project. In Continental Europe, activity remained stable in Belgium, where
the Liége tram PPP project was awarded, and rose in Poland and Serbia.

Lastly, three rail businesses joined Colas Rail (Kummler Matter in Switzerland,

Elektroline in the Czech Republic and Alpiq EnerTrans S.p.A. in Italy) as part

of the acquisition of Alpiq Engineering Services’ railway activities.

e Waterproofing: sales were stable at €561 million as the building market
in mainland France picked up again;

¢ Road safety and signalling: sales amounted to €318 million, an increase of
5% versus 2017, on markets that seem to have stabilised but remain highly
competitive due to overcapacity in the industry;

e Networks: sales amounted to €199 million, 14% lower than in 2017, when
activity was boosted by two major gas pipeline projects in France.

21.5 Outlook for the construction businesses

Bouygues Construction

In a market offering many opportunities, Bouygues Construction enjoys
good visibility, backed up by:

orders at 31 December 2018 to be executed in 2019 worth €9.9 billion;

sustained international activity in places with bright economic prospects
such as Australia, Singapore, Canada and Switzerland, which are highly
rated by the NGO Transparency International, strengthened by the
integration of Alpiq InTec in Switzerland, Kraftanlagen Munchen in Germany
and AW Edwards in Australia;

a medium/long-term backlog (two years and more) worth €12.3 billion
at 31 December 2018;

a sound financial structure, backed up by a net surplus cash of €3.1 billion;

a lead in sustainable construction, to which the company devotes much
of its R&D budget;

 astrong commitment to shared innovation for the benefit of customers.
Tight control over the execution of major projects, a selective approach
to orders and innovation will continue to be central priorities for

Bouygues Construction in 2019, together with protecting the health and
safety of employees and project partners.

Bouygues Immobilier

Ina residential property market expected to contract to around 122,000 units,
Bouygues Immobilier intends to take advantage of a land bank strengthened
in 2018 to consolidate its market share and step up the diversification of its
product offering.

The commercial property market is likely to remain buoyant in 2019 and
Bouygues Immobilier expects to significantly increase its order intake.

44 + BOUYGUES * 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT

Colas

Long-term growth prospects on the markets where Colas operates are
good. There are substantial infrastructure construction and maintenance
needs in both developed and emerging countries.

In mainland France, growth in civil works is likely to continue, albeit at a
slower pace than in 2018. Activity will be boosted by investment plans for
transport and a favourable environment in the run-up to municipal elections.

In Europe, the roads and rail businesses will continue to benefit from
European infrastructure plans, with continued strong growth in Central
Europe and major infrastructure projects in the United Kingdom.

In North America, the situation is likely to be mixed. In the United States,
uncertainties over funding remain despite an upbeat economy and substantial
needs. In Canada, the situation is likely to vary from one province to another.
Some have major investment plans while others are dependent on oil prices.

In the Rest of the World, many opportunities exist, with fast-growing zones
such as Australia, ongoing developments in Latin America and many major
projects, especially in the railway sector.

In the Rail business, where the market environment is broadly favourable,
Colas Rail should return to growth, especially on international markets.
Measures to restore profitability will continue to be taken in 2019.

In Waterproofing, an agreement to sell Smac has been concluded with the
investment fund OpenGate Capital. Completion of the sale is subject to the
approval of merger control authorities, especially in France. The disposal
will reduce Colas' revenues by around €600 million, without any significant
impact on operating profit.

Current operating profit is expected to improve due to upbeat markets and
a return to profitability at Colas Rail.

Following the acquisition of Miller McAsphalt group and Alpiq catenary
activity in 2018, Colas continues to grow its core businesses: roads, materials
and railways.

The group is continuing its transformation, through digital technologies in

particular, and continues to innovate to assert its leadership in the service
of sustainable mobility.

2.211 Growth strategy and opportunities

Pursuing the transformation of the unencrypted TV
model

The TF group provides a unique range of unencrypted and pay-TV content
and services responding to new viewer behaviour.

Television remains the most consumed media in France with a viewing
time of 3 hours and 36 minutes per day*. It is the leading platform for the
consumption of video content”, with 86% of video viewing time spent
watching TV shows, regardless of the screen. For 15-24-year-olds, this share is
nearly 60% of viewing time, underlining their strong appetite for TV content.
While linear content continues to account for most consumption, non-linear
content is growing significantly.

Inan increasingly competitive environment, the TF1 group's five unencrypted
channels‘ remain as popular as ever, with 46 million French people watching
them every week (equating to 80% of households with a television) *. This
large audience share results from the group's expertise in understanding
viewer expectations and its ability to offer high-quality content at the right
time and for a broad viewership by adapting to changes in behaviour and
new trends.

TF1 monetises this powerful content distribution with advertisers and
offers them immediate brand value creation, backed up by the use of
new advertising and data technologies. For example, TF1 is preparing for
addressable television in which different advertising messages adapted to
each television viewer are delivered during the same show.

The TF1 group has also successfully transformed its core business model
through:

e the MYTF1 platform;

the monetisation of its additional content and services with telecom
operators and Canal+;

and, in the future, the OTT platform called Salto*.

Developing new growth sources from production
and digital media

TF1 is also transforming through strong development in the new growth
areas of production and digital media, both of which are major value creators.
These new sources of growth will enable the group to increase the share ofits
sales generated by activities other than advertising on the five unencrypted
channels.

‘a) Source: Médiamétrie - 2018 data. Individuals aged 4 and over.

Production

TFlis further bolstered by Newen, acquired in 2016, which boasts recognised
expertise in all types of content:

across all genres, from drama to animation, and

e across all ranges, from big-budget productions to controlled-budget
productions;

thanks to its pool of independent producers and talents. Newen has also
become a major player in production in Europe with the successful launch
of new shows on all the incumbent channels. It has also developed original
series for new customers including Amazon, Netflix and OCS. The company
aims not just to develop in Europe but to become a European leader in
drama, as shown by its acquisition of stakes in Tuvalu and, more recently, in
Pupkin in the Netherlands and in Nimbus in Denmark.

Newen is a profitable and growing group that aims:
to produce over 300 hours of drama content in 2019 and

expand its business volume in the coming three years following two years
of strong growth’.

Digital
The TF1 group has created a new digital division, called Unify, with a view to:

providing an additional offer based on web-origin content targeting an
internet audience

e strengthening its offering for advertisers to regain value in a growing
digital advertising market

The purchase of the aufeminin group has led to the creation of a digital
division comprising well-known brands (aufeminin, Marmiton, My Little Paris,
Livingly Media, Doctissimo, Gamned!, Vertical Station’, Studio71, Beauté
Test, etc.) focused on strong themes (well-being, lifestyle, cooking, beauty,
parenting, etc.) for a targeted audience. With these acquisitions, TF1 now has
a business-to-consumer (B2C) offering based on powerful brand communities
as well as expertise for advertisers with which TF1 can form a direct and
“disintermediated" relationship.

Through the unique proprietary technology developed by Livingly Media
in the US, the TF1 group has gained a tool for marketing digital inventories
that optimises the advertising campaign performances of its customers.
To support the organic growth of the Digital and Production divisions, TFl has
announced an annual external growth investment budget of some €50 million
over three years. The new developments in digital media and production
enable TF1 to become less dependent on the French television advertising
market by developing business activities that provide

e better visibility thanks to longer business cycles,

e greater flexibility thanks to a more variable cost structure.

2.21.2 Strengths and assets

The overall offering of the TF1 group gives it robust assets:

a unique position in the French broadcasting sector through its five
complementary unencrypted TV channels, including TF1, a leading brand
in France;

e large audiences spanning much of the population;

powerful brands with heightened visibility through many combinations
of TV and digital media;

© unique exposure opportunities for advertisers across all platforms;

e recognised expertise in the production of TV content with Newen and
distribution, both in France and Europe;

e aninternational digital footprint through high-potential technologies and
expertise in the creation and management of powerful brand communities;

© arobust financial structure.

2.21.3. Market position

Television

In 2018, daily TV viewing time? remained at a high level of 3h 36m for
“individuals aged four and over", down six minutes year-on-year. Overall
daily TV viewing time, which includes consumption on other screens” and
outside the home‘, stood at 3h 46m.

In a French DTT market comprising 27 unencrypted channels, the TF1 group
airs, in addition to the leading TV channel TF1, a multi-channel offering
comprising TMC, TFX, TF1 Séries Films and LCI. It competes with state-
owned channels, and private groups such as Métropole Télévision (Mé,
WS9, 6Ter), the Canal+ group (Canal+, C8, CStar, CNews) and Altice (BFM TV,
RMC Découverte, RMC Story).

It remains the most powerful private player, with an audience share of 27.6% ¢
in 2018 versus 13.3% for its main private-sector rival.

2.2.2 Business activity in 2018

In the advertising market, the TF1 group also competes against the press,
radio, web, billboard and cinema media. TF1 Publicité, the TF1 group's
advertising sales agency, is also present in the radio and web advertising
market and markets advertising inventories in Switzerland and Belgium.

Furthermore, the TF1 group is confronted with the arrival of global web
players in the broadcasting sector. It is appealing to the authorities to
introduce fairer competition rules.

To keep pace with the gradual shift in television viewing behaviour (more
individual, more screens, non-linear consumption), TF1 has successfully rolled
out its MYTFI platform across all media, including IPTV, PCs, mobile phones
and tablets. Its catch-up TV service is used by an average of over 19 million
unique visitors * a month.

Production

TF1 boasts long-standing presence in TV content through the sales of rights
catalogues, its video activity and the coproduction of films.

In response to increasing demand in recent years in the television content
market, as well as the concentration of business in the hands of players such
as Endemol Shine, Banijay and ITV Studios, the TF1 group has repositioned
upstream in the value chain by acquiring the Newen Studios group, wholly-
owned since July 2018.

Digital

With the acquisition in first-half 2018 of the aufeminin group, an international
player, TF1 has strengthened its position in digital media. It can now draw
on powerful web audiences based on highly committed brand communities
and unique content for women (aufeminin, Marmiton, My Little Paris, etc.).
In addition, in October 2018 TF1 completed the acquisition of Doctissimo,
a recognised brand with a substantial community, reinforcing the group's
positions with women and in health and well-being. Furthermore, in 2018,
TF1 acquired Gamned!, a company specialising in digital advertising space
purchasing.

In 2018, TF continued its transformation by reshaping the business model of its core business as well as that of its digital media and TV content production

and distribution activities.

2.2.21 2018 results

Increase in sales and current operating profit

TF1 group posted consolidated sales of €2,288 million in 2018, up 7% on

2017 thanks to:

growth in advertising sales at the five unencrypted channels due to
increased ratings and the premium agreements signed with all the
telecoms operators and Canal+;

b) PCs, tablets, smartphones.

the strengthening of TF1's content production and digital activities, with
notably the consolidation of the Unify digital division's activities around
aufeminin, acquired in May 2018.

The TF1 group posted a current operating profit for 2018 of €196 million,
an improvement of €11 million, even though this was a year that saw
the broadcasting of the Fifa Russia 2018™ Soccer World Cup (at a cost
of €72 million). This performance reflects the success in integrating new
revenue streams, but also the ability to optimise profitability by adapting
the cost structure.

Including the costs of broadcasting the Fifa World Cup, the current operating
margin held steady year-on-year at 8.6%. Excluding World Cup costs, the
current operating margin was 11.7% (up 3 points year-on-year).

Group operating profit in 2018 came to €174 million, after factoring in, for the
final year, €22 million in non-current charges related to the amortisation of
audiovisual rights remeasured as part of the acquisition of Newen Studios.

Net profit attributable to the Group for 2018 was €128 million. After excluding
the gain booked in 2017 on the divestment of the equity interest in Groupe AB,
net profit rose year-on-year in 2018.

Results by business activity

Following the acquisition of the aufeminin group on 27 April 2018, a new
sector breakdown was introduced starting in second-quarter 2018. This
mainly concerns the creation of the new digital division Unify grouping
the business activities of the aufeminin group, Neweb, Studio71, TF1 Digital
Factory, Vertical Station’, as well as Doctissimo and Gamned!, which were
acquired more recently.

Broadcasting

Sales for the Broadcasting sector reached €1,764 million, up €46 million. This
increase reflects changes to the sector's business model with the contribution
of sales generated by the agreements signed with the telecoms operators
and Canal+, alongside growth in advertising sales at the five unencrypted
channels (up €17 million, up 1% year-on-year) in line with strong audience
ratings for the group's channels.

The cost of programmes of the five unencrypted channels for 2018 increased
to €1,014 million, up €30 million year-on-year, and included €72 million of
costs for the Soccer World Cup®. This confirms the group's ability to optimise
its programming cost structure while keeping audiences high.

Current operating profit for the Broadcasting sector was €150 million, up
€6.5 million on year-on-year.

Studios and Entertainment

Sales of the Studios and Entertainment sector came to €409 million in 2018,
down €6 million year-on-year. Newen Studios business continues to grow.
In addition to producing and delivering its leading regular shows, Newen
expanded its geographical footprint in Denmark with Nimbus and in the
Netherlands with Pupkin and grew its customer base through productions
for Netflix and Amazon, among others.

The growth in the production business combined with the good results
of TF1 Entertainment, and in particular the PlayTwo music label, failed to
offset the downturn in TF1 Studios. The latter was impacted by less positive
box-office performances in 2018 and by the fall in physical video and home
shopping sales amid declining markets. The TF1 group also announced that it
had entered into exclusive negotiations with a view to selling the operational
side of Téléshopping (its home shopping activity), in order to refocus on its
core businesses.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
TF

This sector has also been impacted since second-quarter 2018 by the
inclusion of Newen's activities (Neweb) in the new Unify digital division.
The sector posted a current operating profit of €34 million, down €9 million
year-on-year. The main impacts were non-recurring charges associated with
the buyout of the residual 30% equity interest in Newen at the start of July,
and weaker performances from cinema and video.

Digital
The sales of the new Unify digital division totalled €116 million, having notably

included the sales of the aufeminin group, which have been consolidated
since May 2018.

The sector made a current operating profit of €12 million over the same
period, giving a current operating margin of 10.4%, which was impacted
by transaction costs related to the aufeminin acquisition.

Financial structure

Shareholders’ equity attributable to the Group was €1,576 million at
31 December 2018 out of total assets of €3,157 million. Net debt was
€275 million at 31 December 2018 (versus net cash of €257 million at end
December 2017), after taking account of the acquisitions of aufeminin group
and of the residual 30% interest in Newen Studios.

In June 2018, Standard & Poor's lifted the outlook on TF1 group's BBB+ credit
rating from negative to stable.

2.2.2.2 Business review in 2018

The benchmark television offering in France

TF1 remained the leading‘ private-sector television group in France in 2018,
with a combined audience share of 32.6% of women aged under 50 who
are purchasing decision-makers (up 0.3 points) and 29.3% of individuals
aged 25-49 (up 0.1 points).

TFI

audience, the channel's best performance since 2015. It scored 91 of the top
100 audience ratings of 2018 (or 88 excluding the Fifa World Cup). Ratings

TF

DTT channels

The Group's DTT channels (TMC, TFX, TF1 Séries Films, LCI) attracted a
combined share of 10.1% of the target women under 50 who are purchasing
decision-makers audience, virtually unchanged year-on-year (down 0.1 of a
point). TMC remains the most-watched DTT channel, with 24 of the 50 top
DTT audience ratings in 2018, including Burger Quiz and Quotidien. TFX has
risen to third place in the DTT rankings for the same target audience, and
continues to perform strongly with younger viewers (15 to 24-year-olds)
thanks to reality TV shows. TF1 Séries Films recorded the second-highest
growth in audience share among women under 50 who are purchasing
decision-makers and posted good audiences for the series The Handmaid's
Tale. Finally, LCl cemented its place as France's No.2 rolling news channel.

2.2.3 Outlook

Growth in the digital business

The digital business grew strongly owing to an increase in interactivity and
advertising sales on MYTF1. Some 1.4 billion TF1 videos were viewed in 2018
on the MYTF1? platform alone, up 9% year on year. This growth was driven
by success across all content categories and notably by Tomorrow is ours,
The Voice, Good Doctor, Paw Patrol, Quotidien, Fifa™ World Cup Russia
2018, and La Villa des Coeurs Brisés.

The group will continue its transformation and is reiterating the following guidance:

In 2019

e Target of double-digit current operating margin.

In 2021

Sales of at least €250 million from the Unify digital division.
e EBITDA margin of at least 15% from the Unify digital division.

e An improvement in TF1 group's return on capital employed ® relative
to 2018.

Finally, the group is adjusting its objective for the cost of programmes to an average of €990 million, including major sporting events, for the 2019-2020

period, compared with €1,014 million in 2018.

2.31 Profile

2.311 Growth strategy and opportunities

With the rapid growth in digital uses, Bouygues Telecom has positioned itself
as a dependable operator thanks to the quality of its customer support and
its mobile and fixed networks.

Bouygues Telecom is leveraging its key strengths - its 4G network, the
excellent value for money of its mobile plans and the commitment of its
teams - to roll out a four-pronged strategy.

Deliver the simplest possible customer experience
across all channels

Bouygues Telecom has made a sharp customer focus and a simple, seamless
experience the pillars of its strategy. This high-quality customer experience
is the result of digitized services and a straightforward, efficient purchasing
process, backed by the commitment of its 3,800 customer and sales advisers.

Acompany-wide plan was initiated in 2018 aimed at significantly boosting
customer satisfaction by the end of 2020. More than 200 projects have been
launched in order to make the user experience more seamless and more
intuitive, and to satisfy customer expectations more quickly. In 2018, the
loan of 4G mini-hubs or handsets were able to keep customers constantly
connected and the customer service hotline expanded its opening hours.

Ensure reliable mobile and fixed services for customers
via quality networks

Bouygues Telecom covers 99% of the French population with 4G thanks
to around 21,000 mobile sites in order to keep pace with growing mobile
internet use (over 28,000 sites planned by the end of 2023).

e Inless dense areas, 93% of the shared network had been rolled out at the
end of December 2018.

In very dense areas, network capacity improvements continue with the
addition of 2,000 new sites planned by 2022.

Bouygues Telecom also has a diverse range of available frequencies thanks
to total investments of around €2 billion. Coupled with the technology
underpinning its network infrastructure, this has enabled the operator to
aggregate its frequency bands to offer even faster speeds and improved
quality of service. In 2018, Bouygues Telecom optimized its network to refarm
the 2100 MHz frequency band to 4G, as was previously done for the 700,
800, 1800 and 2600 MHz bands.

In the fixed business, Bouygues Telecom aims to bring the benefits of
very-high-speed internet to as many people as possible by accelerating
rollout of its fibre network, with 7.2 million premises marketed at the end
of December 2018. The target is 12 million premises marketed by the end
of 2019 and 20 million in 2022. In late 2018, Bouygues Telecom signed a
partnership with the Axione/Mirova consortium to roll out 3.4 million

premise in very dense areas. This will give Bouygues Telecom access to
the entire very dense area by the end of 2021.

Boost regional development by helping reduce the
digital divide

By sharing mobile infrastructure and rolling out fibre networks,
Bouygues Telecom offers services to new customers across France, especially
in less densely populated areas. It has forged closer relations with customers
by developing local sales of its solutions, including a strategic agreement
with Fnac Darty to market Bouygues Telecom fixed and mobile offers in the
approximately 50 Fnac Connect stores to be opened, beginning in 2018.
The operator also plans to open around ten new stores in 2019.

A complete range of fixed and mobile solutions for
businesses

The business market is a key avenue of growth for Bouygues Telecom in
both the mobile and fixed segments thanks to the high quality of its 4G
network and ongoing roll-out of its fibre infrastructure. With a market share
of over 20% in the mobile segment, the operator bolstered its position in the
French B2B market in 2018. It aims to increase its market share by targeting:

e large and mid-size companies in the fixed segment;
SMEs in both the fixed and mobile segments.

In line with this strategy, Bouygues Telecom has acquired 43.6% of Keyyo *
and 100% of Nerim ° in order to accelerate its expansion in the market
serving micro-businesses, SMEs and intermediate-size businesses. Keyyo will
contribute its complementary expertise in advanced digitization solutions as
well as in innovative products and services, particularly in the fixed segment.
Nerim will provide Bouygues Telecom with its technical expertise in the
selling of data networks and website hosting for SMEs.

Bouygues Telecom subsidiary Objenious is also supporting the development
of the Internet of Things (loT) with its own network based on Long Range
(LoRa) technology. This LoRa’* network covers 93% of the French population.
The Objenious offer spans a secure network, a choice of sensors, as well
as a processing platform and business-specific applications, enabling its
customers to leverage the value of their data.

2.31.2 Strengths and assets

Committed employees

Bouygues Telecom sustains long-term growth momentum thanks to
the performance and commitment of its employees. Strong employee
commitment was confirmed by the latest satisfaction survey which
showed that 95% of staff are prepared to give their best effort for the
company. This strong employee engagement is a major asset that will help
Bouygues Telecom drive continued growth and achieve its objectives.

(a) Acquisition of a 43.6% stake in Keyyo on 18 January 2019 and a public tender offer by Bouygues Telecom with a view to holding 100% of Keyyo shares.
(b) On 20 February 2019, Bouygues Telecom and Dzeta Partners signed an agreement for Bouygues Telecom to acquire 100% of the capital and voting rights of Nerim.

The acquisition was completed on 13 March 2019.

(c) Associated with the LoraWAN™ protocol, the market standard, Lora® provides long-range connectivity and reduced energy consumption.

fixed segments in 2018, resulting in very good commercial performance
and enabling it to achieve objectives set.

2.3.21 Business review

The French mobile * and fixed broadband market *

The French telecommunications market has experienced sweeping change
for a number of years, impacted by several underlying trends:

e strong competitive pressure in both the mobile and fixed segments, in
particular in the mobile segment with a surge in promotional offers during
the first three quarters of the year, especially SIM only/Web only offers;

© growing appeal of very-high-speed fixed and mobile services as customers
increasingly consume video and content on demand at home and on
the move.

In the fourth quarter of 2018 the French mobile phone market totalled
73 million SIM cards, excluding machine-to-machine SIM cards. The market
continued to expand, increasing by 1.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2017,

An excellent 4G network to underpin the explosion
in mobile internet use

The high-quality nationwide coverage of the Bouygues Telecom 4G network
gives the company a long-term competitive advantage, enabling it to
stand out in an extremely competitive market. In October 2018, French
telecoms regulator Arcep ranked Bouygues Telecom the leading mobile
telecommunications operator for voice, text and data services in rural zones
in France and number two on average for the entire country.

Thanks to more than 21,000 sites, Bouygues Telecom can offer its customers
directly-owned coverage of 99% of the population in 2G, 3G and 4G.

In addition, thanks to its extensive range of available frequencies,
Bouygues Telecom is positioned to accommodate the rise in mobile internet
use by its customers.

customers and businesses.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Bouygues Telecom

Ramping up network roll-out

Bouygues Telecom stepped up the roll-out of its directly-owned fixed
infrastructure - ADSL and FTTH - in order to provide services to as many
households as possible at highly competitive prices and increase its share
of the broadband and very-high-speed market.

Bouygues Telecom's directly-owned ADSL network covered over 17 million
households at end-December 2018 via more than 2,000 central offices.

In the very-high-speed market, Bouygues Telecom continued to roll out its
directly-owned FTTH network, and signed joint investment and partnership
agreements, including Public Initiative Network (PIN) agreements, increasing
the number of premises secured to over 30 million at end-December 2018.
At year-end 2018, 7.2 million premises had been marketed, representing
growth of 3.2 million premises for the year.

In late 2018 Bouygues Telecom signed a partnership with Cityfast (an Axione/
Mirova consortium) to roll out and operate 3.4 million premises in very dense
areas. This will give Bouygues Telecom access to all very dense areas in France
by the end of 2021, half through joint investments with SFR and Orange,
and half through the agreement with Cityfast (an annual fixed operating
expenditure cost, regardless of the number of customers).

In 2013, Bouygues Telecom began to include VDSL2 in its fixed broadband
offers at no extra cost, delivering theoretical download speeds of up to
100 Mbit/s. VDSL2 enables Bouygues Telecom to further expand its very-
high-speed coverage in France.

Commercial performance

For the past three years, Bouygues Telecom has consistently performed well
in the fixed broadband market, posting a market share of 12.6% at end-2018.
Bouygues Telecom accounted for 34.9% of total net growth in the French
fixed broadband market in 2018, attracting 235,000 new customers.

Bouygues Telecom had 3.7 million fixed broadband customers at end-
December 2018, including over one million very-high-speed customers,
representing 27% of its base. This growth was driven by FTTH, which
accounted for 303,000 new customers during the year. FTTH thus represented
129% of net growth in fixed subscriptions in the fourth quarter. At end-2018,
Bouygues Telecom had 569,000 FTTH customers.

Development of new growth opportunities

Business and corporate services

Bouygues Telecom Entreprises ranks third in the corporate services market
(SMEs and major accounts) with a portfolio of three million customers,
including over 50,000 SMEs and a third of the companies listed on the CAC 40.
Over the past five years Bouygues Telecom Entreprises has gained market
share in both the mobile and fixed segments. In 2018 the mobile business
customer base increased by 9% and the fixed customer base grew by 13%.

To accelerate growth in its fixed and mobile market shares with SMEs,
Bouygues Telecom acquired 43.6% of Keyyo on 18 January 2019 and then
launched a public tender offer for all remaining shares. It also announced on
21 February 2019 an agreement relating to the acquisition of 100% of Nerim>.
It will also be able to leverage the FTTO (Fibre To The Office) infrastructure
rolled out in very dense areas.

24.2 Management

241 Internal control - Risk management -
Compliance

Bouygues has made risk management one of the cornerstones of its corporate culture.

Bouygues SA, the Group's parent company, regards internal control, risk management and compliance
as being among its core missions. On its initiative, many actions have been taken in each of the five
business segments over a number of years. These actions are organised around three strands:

e an Internal Control Reference Manual,

self-assessment of the implementation of the core principles of this reference manual, and

© amapping of the major risks.

Following on from the Group's Code of Ethics, compliance is one of the key factors the Group takes
into account in the conduct of its business. In close cooperation with its business segments, in 2014
Bouygues SA produced four compliance programmes relating to Competition, Anti-corruption, Financial
Information and Securities Trading, and Conflicts of Interest. In September 2017, these programmes
were updated and a fifth compliance programme relating to Embargoes and Export Restrictions was
produced.

These programmes, approved by the Board of Directors, have been widely disseminated within the
Group, under the impetus of the Ethics, CSR and Patronage Committee and the Board of Directors.

Bouygues SA pays particular attention to management of the Group, taking steps to encourage dialogue and exchanges of experience between support
structures and business segments, motivate staff and uphold a shared commitment to the Group's values. This synergy is especially visible in the initiatives

taken within the field of innovation (see section 1.1.4 of this Registration Document) or in relation to CSR (see Chapter 3).

243 Employee share ownership

Bouygues has long been convinced that it is important to give employees
a stake in the Group because they play a key role in its success. As a result,
in 2018 Bouygues’ Board of Directors approved a new capital increase
reserved for employees. The leveraged operation, called Bouygues
Confiance n°10, was completed successfully on 27 December 2018 with
21,143 employees, representing 30.69% of those eligible, subscribing. Details
of the operation are given in the Board of Directors' supplementary report
and in the Auditors’ supplementary report in Chapter 6, section 6.2.2, of
this document.

This once again demonstrates the Group's proactive approach to employee
share ownership, which is a core component of its culture and values.

At 31 December 2018, Group employees owned 18.96% of the share capital
of Bouygues and held 25.83% of its voting rights, through a number of
dedicated mutual funds.

Since 1995, two representatives of employee shareholders have had seats
on Bouygues' Board of Directors.

Flows of funds between the business segments

There are no significant flows of funds between the Group's business
segments. Cash management is centralised within financial subsidiaries
wholly owned by Bouygues SA. This arrangement ensures optimum
management of financial expenses, since the surplus cash generated by
certain subsidiaries can be used in addition to or in place of confirmed lines
of credit granted by credit institutions to others. When investing surplus cash,
Bouygues has always avoided speculative instruments such as securitisation
vehicles and high-yield mutual funds.

Systems

Alstom brings together all its cross-cutting know-how as a rail manufacturer
to manage urban rail systems in their entirety (trains, signalling, infrastructure
and services).

Infrastructure

Alstom offers a comprehensive range of sustainable solutions for tracklaying,
electrification and the supply of electromechanical equipment.

Alstom designs and installs innovative solutions for automated tracklaying
with Appitrack™, for improving energy efficiency with Hesop™ (a reversible
power-supply substation), and for non-catenary power supply with solutions
such as APS™ (ground-level power supply) and SRS (its latest ground-based
static charging system).

Integrated systems

Alstom, the leading provider of integrated urban systems, offers its customers
full-service solutions, whether on the urban transport or mainline market.

Signalling

Alstom provides infrastructure operators and managers with the means
to carry passengers and goods safely and seamlessly, thus optimising the
efficiency of urban or mainline networks. Alstom also develops passenger
safety solutions and network management control centres.

Alstom works hand-in-hand with its customers, whether public or private
rail operators, fleet administrators or maintenance specialists, by offering a
range of customised services (maintenance, modernisation, parts and repairs,
support services) for their trains, infrastructure and rail control systems.
Alstom provides services for all types of fleet, whether built by Alstom or not.

2.51.3 Strategy

Alstom's 2020 strategy is based on the following pillars:

e customer-focused organisation: present in 60 countries, Alstom has
adapted its organisation to strengthen its international coverage and
better respond to the needs of customers on a local level. The company
is organised into empowered regions, each with its own supply chain
to answer local needs using local resources and strengths. They form a
worldwide network of local industrial facilities and strategic partnerships.

complete range of solutions. Drawing on its expertise in all areas of rail
transport, Alstom offers the widest range of solutions in the industry,
combining its skills to offer customers more than just products. Its
solutions range from parts and rolling stock, signalling and services to
fully integrated systems, ensuring optimised costs, faster delivery times
and an optimal level of performance for all equipment. Alstom is the world
leader in integrated systems. By 2020, signalling, systems and services
are expected to contribute 60% of its sales.

value creation through innovation. Alstom sees innovation as a source of
competitiveness and differentiation as well as a catalyst for winning new
contracts. Its main programmes include a complete renewal of mainline
and urban train ranges as well as the latest innovations in systems, signalling
and services. Alstom intends to take full advantage of digital technology
in areas such as predictive maintenance.

operational and environmental excellence. When carrying out contracts,
Alstom seeks to achieve the highest standards in terms of quality, cost
and lead times. This operational excellence goes hand in hand with a
commitment to environmental performance in response to high market
expectations with regard to products (energy efficiency), manufacturing
processes (eco-design, green materials) and lifecycle management
(recycling). By making its products and services more competitive and
ensuring excellence in project management, Alstom seeks to reduce costs
in order to offset lower prices worldwide and help to improve margins. The
company expects to save an estimated €250 million a year on sourcing
costs through a focus on volume, design-to-cost and worldwide sourcing.
Alstom will continue to increase its manufacturing and engineering
footprint around the world while adapting it to the workload in Europe.
A specific "Cash Focus" programme has also been introduced, with a
strong emphasis on managing the working capital requirement. As far
as environmental excellence is concerned, the aim is to reduce energy
consumption in terms of kWh per hours worked by 20% for solutions and
by 10% for operations by 2020 versus 2014.

diverse and entrepreneurial people. In the belief that differentiation is a
source of performance, and in order to reflect its passenger base, Alstom
encourages all types of diversity within its teams in areas such as gender
and multiculturalism. This internal cohesion is rooted in very strong values -
team spirit, trust and initiative - and ethical rules. Alstom's development is
also underpinned by an entrepreneurial mindset that promotes customer
satisfaction, responsibility and responsiveness. The company intends to
significantly increase diversity, for example by setting a target of having
25% of managerial positions filled by women by 2020.
