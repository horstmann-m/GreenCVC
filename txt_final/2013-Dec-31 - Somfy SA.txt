MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

[O THE COMBIN

D GEN

RAL M

[ING

OF 14 MAY 2014

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in force,
the Management Board has convened you here in order to
inform you on the management of your company and its
subsidiaries and to submit for your approval the financial
statements for the year ending 31 December 2013.

The Somfy Group is structured as two separate branches:
Somfy Activities, which is dedicated to the automation
and control of openings and closures in residential and
commercial buildings (blinds, shutters, curtains, screens,
doors, gates, etc.); and Somfy Participations, which is
dedicated to investments and equity shareholdings in
industrial companies operating in various business sectors.

Highlights of the year
Changes in Group structure

In May 2013, Somfy Activities made a 51% equity
investment in the Brazilian company Giga for BRL 18 million
(approximately € 5.5 million, including a deferred payment
of € 1.8 million). This company designs and manufactures
security systems which it markets to specialised distributors
and installers in Brazil. This transaction includes an earn-
out clause payable in 2015 based on the results of the
2013 and 2014 financial years. It also includes a first mutual
put/call option exercisable in 2016 in relation to 24% of the
capital and a second one exercisable in 2018 in relation to
the remaining 25%. This acquisition generated provisional
goodwill of BRL 23.6 million (€ 7.3 million), which is liable
to change during the 12-month allocation period from the
acquisition date. This company has been fully consolidated
from April 2013 and contributed € 11.2 million to Group
sales in the financial year.

At the end of November 2013, Somfy Activities acquired
the usufruct of the entire capital of the Brazilian company
Garen Automagao for BRL 20 million (€ 6.1 million). This
transaction includes an earn-out clause payable in 2016
based on performance criteria. Somfy Activities will also
have the option of acquiring full ownership of the securities

from 2016, through the exercise of options. Garen
Automagao has been fully consolidated from 31 December
2013. This acquisition generated provisional goodwill of
BRL 46.9 million (approximately € 14.4 million), which is
liable to change during the 12-month allocation period from
the acquisition date.

In July 2013, Somfy Participations acquired shares
in CIAT for a total of € 3.3 million, through its subsidiary
Arve Finance, thereby increasing its equity holding in
this company from 44.5% to 46.1%. This increase in the
holding percentage did not alter the equity accounting of
this company.

Tax audits

Somfy SAS was subject to a tax assessment in relation to
the 2009 and 2010 financial years. The main adjustment
related to the transfer price policy implemented between
a subsidiary of Somfy SA, Somfy SAS and a number of
distribution subsidiaries. The proposed tax adjustment
for these two years totalled € 35.6 million. No provision
was established at 31 December 2012 as the Group was
confident at that time of achieving a favourable outcome
and had therefore classified this dispute as a contingent
liability pursuant to IAS 37.

During the second half of 2013, Somfy SAS, with the
assistance of its legal advisers, accepted to enter talks with
the tax authorities in order to reach an outcome acceptable
to all parties.

Even though the Group still considers that the arguments
put forward by the tax authorities are disputable, it is now
likely that Somfy SAS will be compelled to accept a portion
of the tax adjustment notified.

Therefore, the Group recognised a liability in the financial
statements ended 31 December 2013 for the amount it
deems necessary to settle this tax risk.

A provision of € 8.4 million was thus established, with a
corresponding impact on the income tax charge for the
2013 financial year. A provision was also established at
31 December 2013 for other residual impacts resulting
from this tax adjustment.

Somfy SA was subject to a tax audit in relation to the 2010
and 2011 financial years. A total proposed adjustment of


--- Page 3 ---

€ 4.4 million (including late payment penalties) for these two
years was received on 27 November 2013. A provision was
recognised in the financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2013 to cover the estimated cash outflow.
Somfy Mexico SA de CV, the Group’s Mexican subsidiary,
has been subject to a tax audit by the tax authorities in
relation to foreign trade matters. The proposed tax
adjustment amounts to €1.6 million, primarily related
to customs duties. Somfy Mexico has appealed to the
Mexican tax authorities which confirmed its opinion at
the end of September 2013. Following this reply, Somfy
Mexico has appealed to the administrative court. The
Group considers that the arguments put forward by the
tax authorities remain disputable and is confident in the
likelihood that this ruling will be overturned. Therefore, the
Group qualified the risk as a contingent liability and no
provision was recognised at 31 December 2013.

Presentation of financial
statements

Parent company financial results

For the year to 31 December 2013, Somfy SA sales
were €2.7 million. Net financial income amounted to
€ 77.6 million, including € 63.4 million in dividends paid by
its subsidiaries in respect of their net profit for the year to
31 December 2012.

Net profit totalled € 62.5 million, after deducting an income
tax charge of € 4.6 million.

Sales by customer location

Consolidated financial statements

Sales

Group sales totalled €996.8 million for the full year
just ended. This was an increase of 0.7% in real terms
compared to the previous year (up 3.2% on a like-for-like
basis), and significant added momentum over the second
half-year (up 5.2% on a like-for-like basis).

Somfy Activities’ sales rose from € 889.8 million to
€ 922.8 million (up 3.8% on a like-for-like basis), an
increase that was due to growth across all regions with the
exception of Northern Europe.

The most significant growth was seen in Asia-Pacific, the
Americas, and Central and Eastern Europe (up 10.2%,
8.1% and 5.2% respectively on a like-for-like basis).
Germany and France also performed well (up 4.2% and
2.7% respectively on a like-for-like basis). The same was
true of Southern Europe, which returned to growth despite
an economic environment that remained challenging
across much of the region (up 1.6% on a like-for-like basis).
Northern Europe by contrast remained negative due to
poor weather conditions at the beginning of the year and
the weak construction market (down 1.2% on a like-for-like
basis).

Somfy Participations’ sales fell from € 103.1 million to
€ 77.3 million (down 4.1% on a like-for-like basis), a decline
that resulted primarily from the deconsolidation of Cotherm.
The other two fully-consolidated companies, Sirem and
Zurfluh-Feller, both recovered over the latter part of the
period, but reported full year declines as a result of the fall
recorded over the first few months (down 7.4% and 2.9%
respectively on a like-for-like basis).

Results

The Group’s current operating result was € 150.6 million
for the financial year, a 13.9% increase in real terms, and
represented 15.1% of sales compared to 13.4% in the
previous financial year. This increase was due to a higher
margin on cost of sales, controlled employee expenses
(2.1% decline against sales growth of 0.7%) and stable
external expenses.

Consolidated net profit totalled € 101.2 million over the
financial year (up 19.9% in real terms). It sustained a tax
charge that rose sharply (€ 39.0 million in 2013 compared
to € 26.1 million in 2012), as a result of the recovery in
profits and a provision for the ongoing tax dispute within
Somfy SAS (€ 8.4 million) and the increase in the tax rate to
38% (additional tax charge of € 2.2 million). It also benefited
from an improvement of the net non-recurring expense
(€ 11.8 million in 2013 compared with € 17.3 million in
2012) and a substantially improved share of profit of
equity-accounted companies (profit of € 1.5 million in 2013
compared with a loss of € 10.1 million in 2012).

Segment reporting at 31 December 2013

Financial position

The Group had a net cash surplus of € 92.3 million at
the end of December, compared to € 31.1 million twelve
months previously. This was due to a marked decrease
in working capital requirements and a high level of cash
flow being maintained. The change was primarily due to
increased cash from operating activities.

The net financial surplus corresponds to the difference
between financial assets and financial liabilities. Notably,
it takes into account unlisted bonds receivable, issued
by certain companies in which shares are held or related
entities, earn out on acquisitions, liabilities relating to options
granted to minority shareholders in  fully-consolidated
companies and deferred settlements of a financial nature.
Not included are securities in non-controlling equity
investments, convertible bonds, deposits & guarantees
and government grants.

The net financial surplus is detailed in note 23 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of Somfy Participations
portfolio

Methodology

The net asset value at December 2013 is the sum of the
financial assets owned by Somfy Participations.

Financial assets defined as bonds are valued at their
nominal value including accrued interest.

Regarding _fully-consolidated or — equity-accounted
investments and assets available for sale, the assessment
methods chosen are the following:

Securities of unlisted companies:

For each investment, the enterprise value is measured

according to standard methods, namely:

— Market Peer Multiples method
A sample of comparable companies, comprising listed
companies in the same industry for which analysts
regularly publish their research and estimates, is identified
for each company valuation. It is stable over time and
is adjusted only if a comparable sample is no longer
relevant. The multiples of the companies in the sample
are calculated by (i) the average market capitalisation
over the last 20 trading days prior to the assessment
and net debt, which is estimated by analysts at the
assessment date and (ii) EBITDA and EBITA estimates
for the current year and the subsequent two years,



--- Page 5 ---

derived from the most recent consensus among analysts
at the time of the analysis. A discount may be applied on
certain multiples to reflect the smaller size of companies
in the sample and the company being valued. The
average multiples of EBITDA (Earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and EBITA (current
operating result excluding amortisation of intangible
assets allocated following acquisitions) of companies
in the sample are applied to the recurring EBITDA and
EBITA of the current year and subsequent two years of
the company being valued. The enterprise value derived
is calculated as the average of the values obtained by
applying these multiples to investment aggregates.

— Discounted cash flow method (DCF)
This method involves determining the present value of
cash flows that a company will generate in the future.
The cash flow projections, prepared in association with
the management of the company concerned, include a
critical analysis of the business plan of these companies.
The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of
capital and represents the level of expected return on
capital employed (equity and debt required to finance the
activity). It is calculated using financial data collected for
the same sample as that used for multiples. The cash
flow projections correspond to those used for impairment
testing.

— Choice of method
Where the company being valued is mature in its market,
its enterprise value is calculated by averaging the market
peer multiples valuation and the discounted cash flow
valuation.
For investments where the bulk of future growth depends
on new markets (resulting from a change of strategy) or
which are in decline or recovering, the enterprise value is
calculated using the DCF method.

This multiple criteria analysis notably takes into account
Somfy Participations intrinsic knowledge of its equity and
its approach to medium-term investment.

The so-calculated enterprise value is increased or
decreased by non-operating items, assessed at their net
book value or market value if it can be reliably determined
and the net financial debt, to obtain the recalculated value
of 100% of the subsidiary. Financial debt is valued at its
nominal value plus accrued interest. The equity stake value
in the net assets is obtained by applying the percentage of
ownership by Somfy Participations at the date of valuation.
A minority discount is applied for certain subsidiaries with
minority shareholding and/or reduced control.

Securities of listed companies are valued using the
average closing price of the last 20 trading days preceding
the assessment.

New investments, subsidiaries and affiliates, whether
listed or unlisted, are valued at cost during the first
12 months of their acquisition. Post-acquisition, the
subsidiaries establish yearly consolidated financial
statements, certified by the Statutory Auditors, and update

SOMFY - 2013 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

their business plans and profit forecasts for the fiscal
year following the date of acquisition. After this period,
companies are valued as per the above listed methods.

Post-balance sheet event

On 6 January 2014, Somfy SA was summoned to appear
before the Regional Court of Albertville to seek annulment
of the transfer of the company Spirel, which took place in
2010. Somfy SA challenges the arguments put forward by
Spirel employees’ legal counsel and considers that it has
fulfilled its obligations. Since it cannot be held responsible
for Spirel’s current situation, Somfy SA is confident in the
likelinood that the Court will rule in its favour.

Outlook

The Group remains cautious due to current economic and monetary uncertainty. For this reason, the action plan aimed at
increasing the Group’s efficiency and competiveness will continue over the coming months.

The development effort will be maintained in parallel and adjusted in line with the economic climate. Its primary aim will be
to consolidate Somfy Activities’ positioning in strategic markets (original business, residential access, home automation,
and emerging countries) and may therefore lead to tactical acquisitions, of the same type as Giga and Garen Automacao.
Similarly, new investments will be examined by Somfy Participations, with the aim of strengthening the existing companies,
in particular Zurfilih-Feller, and enhancing the portfolio.

1 November 2010 it had a holding of 595,775 shares representing 7.60% of the share capital of Somfy SA. Due to the lack
of disclosure of whether upward or downward threshold crossings, this company is still presumed to hold between 5% and

unless one of the signatories gives notice of termination to
other signatories.

Bylaws providing provisions
relating to multiple voting rights
(Excerpt of Article 28 of the bylaws)

“The voting right attached to the shares is proportional to
the capital that they represent. All shares have the same
par value and entitle their owner to one vote.

A voting right that is double that conferred on other shares
is allocated to all fully paid shares that have been duly
registered for at least four years in the name of the same
shareholder at the end of the calendar year preceding that
of each General Meeting.

In the case of a capital increase by the capitalisation of
reserves, profits or issue premiums, registered shares
granted free of charge to a shareholder in exchange for
existing shares, which already benefit from this right, will be
entitled to the same double voting right.

All shares converted into bearer shares or whose ownership
has been transferred shall lose their entitlement to a double
voting right, except in instances provided for by law.”

Disclosure of shareholding threshold
crossings during the 2013 financial
year, pursuant to Article L. 233-7 of the

Information on the buyback
of own shares
(Article L. 225-211 of the Commercial Code)

The company has implemented several successive
share buyback programmes. The most recent buyback
programme was launched in 2013; it was authorised by
the Combined General Meeting of 16 May 2013, and had
the following objectives:

- To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity
of the Somfy SA share, by way of an investment services
provider within a liquidity contract that complies with the
Ethics Charter of AMAFI recognised by the “Autorité des
Marchés Financiers”;

- To retain the shares purchased and subsequently
exchange them or use them within the framework of
potential acquisitions, recognising that shares acquired
to that end may not exceed 5% of the company’s share
capital;

— To ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free
share allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees
and/or senior executives of the Group, as well as all other
shares allocated under a company or group savings
scheme (or similar), in relation to employee profit-sharing
and/or any other form of allocation to employees and/or
senior executives of the Group;

- To cover marketable securities giving right to the
allocation of shares in the company, in accordance with
current regulations;

- To proceed with the possible cancellation of acquired
shares, according to the authorisation granted by the
General Meeting of 15 May 2012 in its seventh resolution,
sitting in extraordinary session.

These transactions may notably be carried out at times of
a takeover bid, in compliance with Article 232-15 of the
AMF General Regulations, if the bid is entirely cash-based
and buyback transactions are carried out as part of the
continued implementation of an on-going programme and
are not liable to make the bid fail.

The maximum purchase price is set at € 250 per share.
Therefore, the maximum amount of the share buyback
programme is € 195,920,000.

During the financial year just ended, on the basis of the
authorisations given by the General Meetings of 2012
and 2013, the company bought back 18,695 shares at
an average price of € 160.80, sold 19,454 shares at an
average price of € 159.62 and transferred 14,100 shares
at an average price of € 85.98 in relation to the exercise of
share purchase options and 5,520 shares at an average
price of € 120.15 in relation to the final allocation of free
shares.

Out of the 18,695 shares acquired, 14,433 were allocated
to the liquidity objective and 4,262 to covering share
purchase option plans and plans to grant free shares to
employees and senior executives of the Group.

Trading fees amounted to € 1,327.51.

No other shares were re-allocated for objectives other than
those initially specified.

The company held 412,730 of its own shares at
31 December 2013, representing 5.27% of the capital.
The value of the purchase price of the share amounted
to € 176.80 for a nominal value of € 1 each, representing
a total nominal value of € 412,730 (€ 862 for the liquidity
contract, € 112,254 to be retained for future acquisition
transactions and € 299,614 for option plans to purchase
shares and/or free share allocation plans).

share purchase plan for a period of eighteen months for
shareholders’ approval. This plan would replace the current
programme, which will be terminated early. It would allow
management to purchase up to 10% of the shares of the
company, if necessary restated for any potential capital
increase or decrease transactions that may be carried out
over the timeframe of the programme. The objectives of
this programme would be:

— To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity
of the Somfy SA share, by way of an investment services
provider within a liquidity contract that complies with the
Ethics Charter of AMAFI recognised by the “Autorité des
Marchés Financiers”;

- To retain the shares purchased and subsequently
exchange them or use them within the framework of
potential acquisitions, recognising that shares acquired
to that end may not exceed 5% of the company’s share
capital;

— To ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/ or free
share allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees
and/or senior executives of the Group, as well as all other
shares allocated under a company or group savings
scheme (or similar), in relation to employee profit-sharing
and/or any other form of allocation to employees and/or
senior executives of the Group;

- To cover marketable securities giving right to the
allocation of shares in the company, in accordance with
current regulations;

- To proceed with the possible cancellation of acquired
shares according to the authorisation to be granted
by this General Meeting of shareholders in its sixth
resolution, sitting in extraordinary session.

These transactions may notably be carried out at times of

a takeover bid, in compliance with the applicable legislative

regulations.

The company reserves the right to use options or derivative

instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

We propose to set the maximum purchase price at € 250

per share, and consequently the maximum amount of the

share buyback programme at € 195,920,000.

As a result of the cancellation objective, we request that

you authorise the Management Board, for a period of

24 months, to cancel, at its own discretion, on one or more

occasions, within a limit of 10% of capital, calculated on the

day on which the cancellation decision is made, reduced
by the number of shares cancelled during the previous

24 months, the shares which the company holds or could

hold following share buybacks exercised under the terms

of its share buyback programme, and to reduce share
capital by the corresponding amount pursuant to the legal
and regulatory provisions in force.

The Management Board would thus be granted the power

to do whatever is necessary in that respect.

Elements liable to have
an impact in the event
of a public offering
(Article L. 225-100-3

of the Commercial Code)

Under existing regulations, the following may have an

impact in the event of a public offering:

— The capital structure and all direct or indirect holdings
known of Somfy SA and all relevant information that
is described under “Information on the distribution of
capital and holdings”;

— There are no bylaw restrictions to the exercise of voting
rights;

— There are no securities carrying special voting rights,
aside from the existence of double voting rights enjoyed
by fully paid shares registered under the same named
shareholder for at least four years (see excerpt from
Article 28 of the bylaws);

— Voting rights attached to Somfy SA shares held by
personnel through FCPE Somfy (Somfy Investment Fund
Scheme) are exercised by a representative appointed by
the Supervisory Board of the FCPE to represent it at the
Annual General Meeting;

— Commitments signed between shareholders that could
lead to restrictions on the transfer of shares and exercise
of voting rights have been referred to in the “Action in
concert and retention agreements” section;

— Rules governing the appointment and replacement
of Management Board members and any bylaw
amendments are respectively provided for in Articles 15
and 30 of the bylaws reproduced below:

Bylaw provisions relating

to the appointment and replacement
of members of the Management Board
(Article 15)

“The Management Board is composed of a minimum of
two and a maximum of five members who may or may not
be shareholders.

In accordance with and for the period provided for by
the law, the Supervisory Board will appoint Management
Board members, determine their number, nominate the
Chairman of the Management Board and determine their
remuneration.

No person aged over 70 may be appointed to the
Management Board. Upon reaching this age, members of
the Management Board are deemed to have resigned at
the Supervisory Board’s next meeting.

The Supervisory Board is authorised to assign the powers
of the Chairman of the Management Board, as conferred

20

by law, to one or more members of the Management Board
who carry the title of Chief Executive Officer.

Management Board members can be re-elected.

In case of a vacancy, a replacement shall be appointed
for the time remaining until re-election of the Management
Board.

If a Management Board member seat is vacant, the
Supervisory Board must change the number of seats it
had previously set or fill the vacancy within a two month
time frame so that the number of Directors does not fall
below the minimum required by the bylaws. Otherwise, any
interested party may ask the President of the Commercial
Court, acting in chambers, to make this temporary
appointment. The person thus appointed may, at any time,
be replaced by the Supervisory Board.

Management Board members or the Chief Executive Officer
may only be dismissed by the Annual General Meeting or by
the Supervisory Board. If dismissal is decided without just
cause, it may give rise to damages. In the case where an
individual holds an employment contract with the company,
the revocation of his/her functions purely as a Management
Board member or Chief Executive Officer will not terminate
this contract.”

Bylaw provisions relating to bylaw
amendments (Excerpt of Article 30)

“Only an Extraordinary General Meeting can modify the

company’s bylaws in all its provisions. Nevertheless it

cannot increase shareholders liabilities with the exception
of transactions resulting from an exchange or regrouping of
shares properly decided and executed.

It requires a two-thirds majority of votes of present or

represented shareholders, including shareholders who

voted by mail”;

— Concerning powers, the Management Board has no
delegations except those described under the sections
“Information on delegations relating to share capital
increases and other authorisations” and “Information on
the buyback of own shares”;

— Agreements concluded by the company that may be
altered or terminated upon a change of control of the
company are as follows: contracts signed between
Somfy SA and credit institutions concerning credit
facilities granted require the latter to inform the said
banks of all projects related to a significant change in
its shareholding, notably those resulting in a transfer of
control to a new company;

— There are no particular agreements providing for benefits
upon termination of the term of office of a Management
Board member.

22

Benefits in kind consist of the use of a company car.
Details of remuneration paid during the year just ended
appear in the summary table (page 24).

The company CMC SARL established a supplementary
pension plan in 2006. This plan applies to Directors and Ill-C
position Senior Executives, as well as Managers benefiting
from an employment contract, in accordance with the
categories defined by the French Convention Collective
Nationale des Ingénieurs et Cadres de la Métallurgie.

The plan grants a contingent right to supplementary
pension, pursuant to the so-called “Article 39”, which is
dependent on the seniority of the beneficiary (a minimum
of 15 years). The right to a supplementary pension is
acquired at a rate of 0.75% per year of service and cannot
exceed 15% of the potential beneficiary's reference salary.
The reference salary is defined as the average of the best
three years after applying CNAV re-evaluation coefficients.
Based on estimates setting at 35% the future rate of
replacement provided by the compulsory pension plans
when the affected population reaches retirement age, this
plan should enable the rate to increase to 35 + 15 = 50%
of the reference salary for beneficiaries whose career within
the Group lasted 20 years or more.

Commitments of the plan and corresponding assets
have been outsourced to an insurance company. Future
commitments are fully covered by plan assets under
management, which were measured at fair value.
Management Board member likely to be concerned by this
plan: Jean-Philippe Demaél.

In relation to his employment contract prior to his
appointment to the Management Board, Jean-Philippe
Demaél also benefits from CMC SARL so-called “Article
83” defined contribution pension plan, applicable to
Senior Executives as well as Managers benefiting from
an employment contract, for whom the portion of
contributions payable by the company represents 6.25%
of remuneration, limited to the tranche B cap applicable to
the Senior Executives’ regime.

The exercise of stock options previously granted to Wilfrid
Le Naour and Jean-Philippe Demaél is included in the
special report presented to the Annual General Meeting,
pursuant to Article L. 225-184 of the Commercial Code.
For members of the Management Board who had
benefited from stock options until then, the new constraints
introduced by the Law of 3 December 2008 have led the
Supervisory Board to exclude them from future allocations
of performance-based shares and stock options. However,
the Board deemed it necessary to continue giving
perspective to their contribution and bring their interest
as much as possible in line with those of the shareholders
and other managers, as in the past. Therefore, it was
decided to grant them variable remuneration based
on identical performance conditions to those used for
allocating performance-based shares to Management.
The proportion of the variable remuneration paid in this
respect in 2013 corresponded to a performance condition
achieved at 60%.


--- Page 13 ---

It should be noted that the Chairman of the Management
Board remains excluded from stock option and
performance-based share allocations and is therefore not
concerned by this decision.

Procedure for setting the remuneration
of Management Board and Supervisory
Board members

The remuneration of Management detailed above is
proposed by the Remuneration Committee. It is revised
each year on the basis of expert advice and is in line with
the market.

The Remuneration Committee, having considered the
Middlenext recommendations on the remuneration of
Directors of listed companies, submits for approval to the
Supervisory Board the various components of remuneration
and the criteria for allocating the variable share of Directors’
remuneration, so that their remuneration may be fixed.

At the General Meeting of 16 May 2013, the shareholders
decided to set attendance fees for the next financial years
at € 100,000 until otherwise specified.

The Supervisory Board apportions attendance fees
among its members in proportion to their attendance at
Board meetings and Audit Committee and Remuneration
Committee meetings.

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives specific
remuneration for carrying out his duties as Chairman.

Information on transactions

Corporate governance

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee currently comprises three members:
Victor Despature Committee Chairman, Valérie Pilcer and
Paule Cellard.

The Committee’s mission is to monitor the preparation of
financial information and the efficiency of internal control
and risk management systems. It is also informed of due
diligence carried out by the Statutory Auditors in their legal
assignment to audit the parent company and consolidated
financial statements, ensures the latters’ independence
and is involved in their selection.

The Audit Committee supervises the work of Internal Audit
and approves the annual audit plan. It proposes, directs
and ensures the follow-up of Internal Audit assignments.
Since its creation, it has met at each half-year and year-end
balance sheet date.

During the 2013 financial year, the Audit Committee met
on five occasions with all members in attendance, with the
exception of one absence at one meeting.

Under the supervision of the Audit Committee, the
Internal Audit Department reports to the Chairman of the
Management Board, and by delegation to the Group's
Chief Financial Officer.

This department, comprising the Internal Audit Officer
and the equivalent of 2.5 auditors, carries out audits that
evaluate the correct application of accounting principles,
the organisation and the systems put in place within the
entity subject to audit.

An annual audit plan, prepared together with the
Management of Somfy Group, is approved by the
Management Board and then validated by the Audit
Committee. The assignments included in the audit plan
provide an independent assessment of the efficiency of the
systems of internal control in each entity.

Where appropriate, the main weaknesses identified in internal
control are reported and recommendations are issued. A
follow-up of the implementation of recommendations is
made each year. A report is presented to the Management
Board and to the Audit Committee.

25

1YOd34y GHVOd LNAINSDVNVIN | ©


--- Page 16 ---

MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT | ©)

In addition, urgent assignments that were not provided for
in the audit plan may be carried out during the year at the
request of the Management Board or the Audit Committee.
Twice a year, the Internal Audit Officer presents a report on
the activities of the Department to the Management Board
and the Audit Committee.

Remuneration Committee

Following the expiry of Jean-Bernard Guillebert’s term of
office as member of the Supervisory Board with effect
from 16 May 2013 and as result of its non-renewal, the
Remuneration Committee currently comprises the following
two members: Michel Rollier, Committee Chairman
(independent member) and Victor Despature. Its mission is
to submit proposals to the Supervisory Board, in particular
in respect of the amount and calculation of Director
remuneration and to provide advice concerning the amount
of attendance fees.

At least once a year, the Committee calls on a firm
specialised in the subject of senior executive remuneration,
which provides advice on the practices that are generally
applied in companies of a comparable size.

During the year just ended, it met three times. The rate of
attendance by the members was 100%.

The members of the Remuneration Committee report
verbally to the Board on their work and on the opinions they
have issued, thus helping the Board to prepare and make
decisions in terms of Directors’ remuneration.

Independence of members
of the Supervisory Board

As provided by the Middlenext framework, the Board has

assessed the independence of its members.

Based on the independence criteria suggested by the

Middlenext framework, the Supervisory Board notes

that, to date, an independent member of the Board is a

member who has no relationship of any nature whatsoever

with Somfy SA or its management, or with a company
consolidated by the Somfy Group, that may affect his/her
freedom of judgment, and who meets the following criteria:

— Is not and has not been an employee and does not hold
and has not held a general management position within
Somfy SA or any other Group company over the last
three years;

— Is nota significant customer, supplier or banker of Somfy
SA or its Group, or for which Somfy SA or its Group
represents a significant share of his/her business activity;

— Is not a significant shareholder of Somfy SA;

- Is not closely related to a Director or major shareholder;

— Has not been a Statutory Auditor of Somfy SA over the
past three years.

In light of these criteria, the Supervisory Board considered

that Paule Cellard, Valérie Pilcer and Michel Rollier qualified

as independent members.

Information on research
and development activities
(Articles L. 232-1 and L. 233-26
of the Commercial Code)

In 2013, Somfy Group firstly redesigned its “R&D Center”
site in Cluses in order to accommodate multidisciplinary
teams on project platforms. By providing a common
workspace for all the functions connected to a project
(design, marketing, purchasing and production), sharing
and efficiency should be improved, thereby reducing the
development time and the time to market for new products.
90% of Somfy Group’s R&D and marketing teams are
now based in Cluses and not far from the factory which
assembles the value-added products.

In research related to home automation, efforts were
focused on expanding the range to include new equipment.
In 2013 therefore, image handling to remotely display the
interior of homes, compatibility with all security sensors and
energy consumption monitoring were all incorporated. In
addition, to create a genuine “ecosystem” of interoperable
home automation solutions, Somfy Group‘s R&D teams
forged links with leading home, heating and security
manufacturers. Development partnerships were signed
with GDF Suez, Atlantic, De Dietrich and Hitachi. Lastly,
in line with the Group’s mission to help improve living
environments, home automation research also focused on
the issue of supporting elderly people in their homes. Thus,
tests were carried out in Holland to develop a new concept
of housing for the elderly: equipment evolves in parallel with
the occupant's level of dependency and is only deployed as
and when required.

In the commercial buildings market, R&D focused in 2013
on the creation of digital solutions enabling feedback and
improved interaction with the building’s management
system. Somfy Group's aim is to launch these digital motors
from 2014, notably in Asia and America. In parallel, Somfy
Group has been working with Bouygues, on providing
householders the opportunity to control their blinds from
their computer.

In 2013, these new products and solutions were protected
by the registration of 36 new patents, enhancing a portfolio
of 450 active patents.

Somfy Group companies exercise their environmental,

social and societal responsibility through the implementation

of Sustainable Development strategies guided by the
following objectives:

— Minimising the environmental impact of all its activities,
sites and products;

— Ensuring the professional and personal development of
all its employees;

— Discharging their civic responsibility by involving
themselves in social issues consistent with their areas
of work;

— Supporting the development of communities wherever
they are established.

In the field of housing, Somfy Group sought to help

improve living environments, by meeting peoples’ growing

expectations in terms of comfort, security, saving energy
and maintaining their independence, by acting responsibly
and ensuring that natural resources are preserved.

Several principles help ensure the implementation of

these strategic policies:

- Acontinuous improvement plan measured by indicators,

— The establishment of a structured dialogue with the
stakeholders: customer satisfaction survey, measuring
employee commitment, investor and shareholder
relations policy, active participation both internationally
and locally with working groups and organisations on
industry issues,

— Regular and transparent communication.

SOMFY - 2013 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

Somfy Group’s Sustainable Development policy
addresses the high expectations of its customers
and all its stakeholders, be they the development of
environmentally friendly solutions, or social or societal
commitments.

Governance

The organisation as a whole and the teams within the
Group contribute to the continuous improvement of the
Sustainable Development policy.

Since 2008, Somfy Activities has had a Sustainable
Development Department. It reports to the Group's
Operations Department. Its missions are to guide the
implementation of the Group’s environmental commitments.
The Group Human Resources Department has the
task of guiding the implementation of Somfy Activities’
commitments relating to social matters.

The Communications Department has the task of guiding
the implementation of Somfy Activities’ commitments
relating to societal matters. In this regard, the Group
Communications Director is a member of the Somfy
Foundation Governing Board, the main driving force of the
Group’s citizenship policy, and whose main purpose is to
support projects that fight poor housing.

The Strategic Committee for Sustainable Development
brings together the Sustainable Development Director,
the Group Human Resources Director and the Group
Communications Director. Its mission is to ensure the
coherent implementation of the three lines of Somfy
Activities’ Sustainable Development strategy: Planet,
Employees and Company.

representing a workforce of 3,776 people, equating to 57%
of the Group's total staff.

These companies are located on four continents (Europe,
Africa, Asia and America) and in six countries (France,

It should be noted that the expanded analysis scope of
the social data will temporarily render any comparison with
data from the previous report difficult.

Some companies were excluded from the scope of this
report. This situation is related to the existence of very
low workforces in certain organisations (distribution
subsidiaries spread out over vast geographic areas such as
Russia or South America), or the lack of Human Resources
information systems designed for collecting data easily.

28

To overcome this last difficulty, an international information
system is currently being deployed within the Group’s main
entities, its aim in the long run being to cover all Somfy
Activities regions and companies.

A responsible corporate policy

The Group’s Social Responsibility policy is to primarily
support Somfy Group’s transformation in its continued
international expansion, in creating new markets and
increasing its innovation activity.

In 2018, the Group continued to deploy its Human
Resources road map along three main lines:

— Commitment,

= Skills and employability,

— Performance.

All the initiatives deployed are aimed at developing the
Group’s “Employer” brand to simultaneously make it a lever
to create both commitment and external attractiveness.

Commitment

¢ Preamble

The measures deployed help to provide both direction
to the collective project and consistency to maintain and
strengthen commitment within the teams.

¢ Working organisation

In all the companies within the scope, the average working
week complies with the applicable local legislation and
varies between 35 and 40 hours of work per week.

The options for individual arrangements vary according
to country and site activity. Such arrangements are better
developed in Europe and in non industrial activities.

Workforce analysis by shift
31/12/13
Daytime work 2,321 61%
Shift work 1,279 34%
Part time work 176 5%
TOTAL 3,776 100%

Organisation by shift schedule is predominant on our
production sites. Depending on the sites it varies between
25 and 90% of the workforce. Overall, shift-based
organisation concerns 40% of the scope’s workforce.

It should be noted that on the six industrial sites covered
by this report, night work is not a permanent working
arrangement.

Collective working hours can vary depending on production
plans and business opportunities. This flexibility is essential
in adapting to market needs.


--- Page 19 ---

* Social relations

Social dialogue is an important element in regulating the

collective organisation of work. The company wishes to

enhance its quality and role.

All the companies comply with the local laws and

agreements connected with their activities.

Although not all have union representatives, social dialogue

is guaranteed or implemented through meetings and/or

communication with staff representative bodies or with
employees directly.

In 2013, certain companies signed new agreements or

amendments to agreements concluded in previous years.

Certain agreements or action plans related to issues

triggered by the legislature, for example in France

(professional equality) or in Italy (training).

More generally, the main agreements and amendments

signed related to:

— Salary increases (France, China and Italy),

— Arrangements for the allocation and administration of
profit sharing and employee shareholding to beneficiaries
(France),

— The allocation of exceptional bonuses (Tunisia),

— Gender equality (France),

Rate of frequency and severity

— Employee training (France, Italy),

— Generational contract and Forward Planning of
Employment and Skills (France),

— Social dialogue framework (France).

Social dialogue is a way of making Somfy Group's social

frame of reference progress and informing employees

about the Group’s position and its development and

transformation areas.

¢ Health and safety

Most of the companies have an occupational health
department and internal safety functions, notably
strengthened in France by the support of Company Doctors
and specialists in ergonomics.

At a constant scope compared with 2012, it should be
noted that the frequency of work related accidents fell
significantly for three of the companies concerned and
increased for the fourth. Conversely, the severity increased
for three of them, with only one company making progress
in relation to this second indicator. Preventive actions had
an effect on the frequency but they must be continued in
order to reverse the severity trend.

Companies Somfy SAS Simu SAS Zurfluh-feller Sirem

Period of comparison 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013

Severity 0.35 0.38 0.14 0.13 0.33 0.72 4.70 3.77

Within the new 2013 scope, it should be noted that the
consolidated rate of frequency was 14.55 and the severity
rate was 0.42.
Safety training was completed by new and existing
employees as well as specialist staff (nurses and safety
officers).
By way of illustration, Somfy SAS staff completed the
following safety training:

TOTAL 3,887 402

SOMFY - 2013 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

More than a quarter of staff thus received safety training, for
an average of around ten hours.

The average rate of absenteeism was 4.4% for the entire
reporting scope. This rate is lower than the rate observed,
for example, in the metallurgy sector in France (6.4% in
June 2012).

Work related accidents and occupational diseases
are monitored, and preventive action implemented, by
dedicated working groups or specially appointed employee
representative bodies, according to country (HSWCC in
France for example).

In regard to accidents at work, preventive action taken
in 2012 and 2013 within companies already included in
the 2012 report was successful, leading to a significant
reduction in work related accidents (90 in 2012 compared
to 59 in 2018).

The rate of frequency is in line with the industry average
whilst the rate of severity remains significantly lower than
the average rate, notably in France. The company will
nevertheless continue to take action in this area as it
remains unsatisfied with this situation.

The employees at highest risk are provided with individual
protective equipment.

MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT | ©)

With regard to occupational diseases, the operations
carried out in our production workshops are mainly
assembly operations involving small parts. The main risks
are those linked to repetitive assembly process operations
(Musculo-Skeletal Disorders - MSD).

Close monitoring of these MSDs has been carried out
for many years in the French factories, with measures
targeting improvement from the design of equipment
through to the training of workers in their gestures and
posture. This expertise in the prevention of MSD in France
has benefited other Group factories through the application
of our industrial standards.

Nevertheless, the number of people affected by a
recognised occupational disease has slightly increased
over the last two years and warrants greater attention in
terms of reducing the demanding nature of certain work
situations.

In addition, action in the area of reducing psycho-social
risks and managing stress has been taken, notably in
France. Prevention in these areas helps to strengthen
wellbeing at work and therefore employees’ commitment.
Quality of working life is a leverage tool that the company
will gradually extend across its entire organisation.

¢ Equal treatment

Taking into account developments in legislation, the
French companies have signed agreements or action
plans committing them to action in the field of professional
equality.

It should be noted that, of the 3,776 employees included
within the scope of this report, the workforce is almost
equally split between men and women. This ratio falls to
39% women and 61% men across the Group as a whole.

Workforce analysis Workforce analysis
by gender - Group by gender - 2013 CSR scope

Male
61%

In the area of disability, the majority of the Group’s
companies are subject to local regulations with which they
comply. Some take additional action, often with the support
of specialist agencies, to improve the working conditions of
any employees affected by specific health problems, their
continued employment remaining an ongoing priority.

30

Several measures, such as adapting workstations or

working hours, adapting premises, or support in terms of

restructuring or reclassification can be seen.

In regards to recruitment, the publication of employment

offers on specialist sites, participation in disability forums,

partnerships with specialist agencies, etc., all create greater

potential for recruiting disabled people.

In other areas, most of the companies take great care not

to discriminate in any way whatsoever from the recruitment

process on, and later in the career management of

employees.

Certain agreements and action plans expressly refer to

objectives in this regard.

Somfy Group has a network of Human Resources

Managers extending across the entire scope covered by

this report. One of their main roles is to ensure the respect

of Human Rights, particularly examining within their scope

rights and concerns relating to racial discrimination, torture,

enforced disappearances, disabled people and the rights

of women, children, migrants, minorities and indigenous

peoples.

By way of example, the agreements signed by the French

companies in the field of professional equality particularly

relate to:

- Working conditions and reconciling work and the
exercise of family responsibility,

— Actual remuneration,

— The training and professional qualification of women,

— Job desegregation,

— Professional career and promotion,

— Recruitment.

*¢ Commitment survey
In late 2012, the Group conducted a survey on commitment
covering its entire worldwide scope. Commitment goes
beyond just team satisfaction and constitutes a key factor
for the company’s success.
The Group return rate for this survey was 82%.
The overall results were provided to all management and
employees at the start of 2013.
These results highlighted our strengths, to be maintained,
as well as our opportunities for improvement:
Opportunities Strengths to maintain
Somfy Group

Management was responsible for implementing and
following an action plan with its team and to thereby help
improve the commitment of Somfy Group employees.

To date, approximately 350 action plans (in France and
internationally) have been finalised in consultation with the
teams.

The main areas covered by these action plans are
cooperation, training and development, Performance
management, work processes, recognition, career
opportunities, customer focus and management.

During the first half of 2014, a new commitment
questionnaire will measure the extent to which these action
plans have improved the previous score.

Employability and skills

¢ Preamble

All the initiatives are undertaken to ensure that the skills
of Group employees are matched with the organisation's
needs and to ensure the employability of staff.

¢ Employment

Following a global effort initiated by Group management to
reduce structural costs, Somfy Group sought to maintain
profitable growth as the only way to preserve its financing
capacity and growth drivers.

This streamlining was accompanied by a_ different
breakdown of staff. Thus, five companies located in Europe
and the United States saw their workforce fall in 2013,
whilst four others, mainly industrial sites, saw their staff
numbers increase (by 3% in China and 6% in Tunisia).

In total, the workforce within the scope has remained
stable, with 372 new employees for 373 people leaving
(including 26 redundancies).

¢ Training

All levels of staff employed by all companies within the
scope of the report received training.

The most popular training topics concern management,
lean manufacturing, design and innovation, quality, safety,
and the development of international opportunities.

New training modules were launched in the area of project
management and customer focus.

SOMFY - 2013 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

e Jobs and Skills Planning and Generations

Somfy Group has begun setting up an Observatory
in France responsible for skills forecasting analysis, in
particular those that may be impacted in qualitative and
quantitative terms in the years ahead.

Somfy Group will provide its skills forecasting analysis,
particularly in relation to affected skills, through this
Observatory. In this way, the company and its employees
will be mutually accountable on the issue of employability.
In parallel, a device known as HORIZON was introduced in
France to support employees in relation to analysing and
securing their career path and to identify further progression
where applicable.

Created in the autumn of 2013, approximately 150
employees will benefit from this programme in 2014.

¢ Academy: Leadership and management

Somfy Group has created and deployed a new
Academy focused on strengthening leadership and team
management. This training programme was rolled out
globally through both France and International pilot groups.
This Course, aimed at Managers’ Managers, strives to
strengthen our ability to adapt to internal and external
change, and to encourage transformation by sharing a
common managerial language and practices.

The course involves 12 days of training, spread over
nine months. It covers all top management, approximately
170 people. 30 managers were thus trained in 2013, with
another 30 in 2014.

In parallel, the Management Committees of the various
entities have adopted the processes and tools identified
during this course, and have deployed them at an
operational level within their teams.

This dual approach encourages the adoption of managerial
practices best suited to our organisation's challenges.

Performance

¢ Preamble
The Group's aim is to strengthen the culture of individual
and collective performance whilst adhering to its values.

¢ Project to overhaul the performance review

A new mechanism to monitor performance is under
construction, integrating cross entity targets to promote
cooperation, and the strengthened link between
performance and bonus. It should be rolled out from the
end of 2014, following the training of managers.

Within the framework of the Academy “Leadership and
Management”, the managers are already being trained in
providing feedback to and coaching their teams.

The impact of the new Performance development system
will ensure quality and uniformity in the rollout of an
appraisal system which:

31

1YOd34y GHVOd LNAINSDVNVIN | ©


--- Page 22 ---

MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT | ©)

— Expressly informs employees of the requirements and
priorities related to their position (permanent tasks);

— Defines Group performance targets by entity, individual
and of management;

— Explains the level of expectation in terms of skills and
behaviours via a clear and common frame of reference;

- Establishes a clear link between performance and
remuneration: individual increase measured against
performance of permanent role and bonus measured
against annual targets;

- Interacts with other HR processes (remuneration,
training, career management).

Ensuring that managerial interviews are properly

conducted:

— Training managers in a SMART definition of targets and
in how to conduct various interviews;

— Offering support to managers on the assessment of
employees in the event of a particular concern (poor
performance, behaviour problem, etc.).

¢ Talent review

Providing better information regarding career opportunities

within the Group:

— Global: People review (succession planning, identifying
potential and key roles),

— France: Professional Development Process currently
being finalised.

e Remuneration: Project to categorise management
positions (Grading)

The aim of this project is to implement, in 2014, an organised
and hierarchical system of management positions within
the Group's structure through the intermediary of a Mercer
assessment methodology.

The implementation of Grading will enable the provision of
clear information on the rules for employees’ eligibility for
the different components of the remuneration packages
and on employee benefits in place.

This approach will mean that common rules can be
shared, enabling internal and external fairness to be better
defended, and providing managers with a common tool to
monitor their management teams (remuneration and career
management).

The definition of benchmarks, assessment and the
validation of results were completed by the management
and the members of the Executive Committee at the end of
2013. Implementation and notification will take place during
the first quarter of 2014.

¢ International Human Resources Information System:
IHRIS

The Human Resources Department sought to equip the
Group with an international human resources information
system, able to monitor key HR processes in support of
Somfy Group’s economic project.

These processes notably concern staff monitoring,
management and performance, team reviews, succession
planning, remuneration, etc.

32

This Human Resources information system (HRIS) will
help to build and develop an HR culture that is shared far
beyond the HR community, and to provide management
with new decision making aids.

The creation of this HRIS is based on a foundation of
personal and professional data which was prepared during
the second quarter of 2013.

Its gradual rollout across all the Group’s companies is
planned to start at the end of the first quarter of 2014 and
will continue for between two and five years depending on
the scope.

Additional HR business applications will be under
consideration from the second quarter of 2014 and will
form the basis of a progressive international deployment
plan over the next few years so that the information system
increasingly adds value for Group management and
employees.

The Humans Resources roadmap is an ambitious reflection
of the company’s economic project. Somfy’s responsible
company model is gradually being strengthened, thereby
supporting the Group’s values and the trust of the
stakeholders who are committed to the success of the
connected home.

Environmental information

Nature of activities, associated risks
and measures taken

The activities of the sites are tertiary, industrial and logistical.
The industrial sites mainly perform product assembly
operations from plastic components, metals and circuit
boards sourced from outside the sites. Assembly
operations do not product gas emissions, liquid releases
or substances discharges, with the exception of packing
waste and possible manufacturing scrap which are subject
to selective sorting and recovery.

There are no machine operations generating waste material.
There is no specific noise pollution generated by the
industrial sites affecting local residents. Indeed, operations
are situated inside the buildings and mainly consist of the
assembly of small parts.

The different sites located within French territory are subject
to classification levels compliant with French legislation in
relation to pollution or nuisance risks that these facilities are
likely to create.

The sites are subjected to an authorisation scheme for
storage in covered warehouses and a registration scheme
for compression facilities and installation of accumulators
for recharging fork-lift trucks.

Zurfluh-Feller takes in machine operations and metal
forming, plastics moulding and surface treatment.

Every year, Zurfllih-Feller, due to the nature of its activities,
carries out a campaign to measure its noise emissions that
has not shown any evidence of any particular environmental
nuisance.


--- Page 23 ---

There are no facilities that correspond to the maximum
level, “Authorisation with encumbrances - (AS)3” commonly
known as “SEVESO”.

Conclusions on the nature of activities,
associated risks and measures

For these reasons, the risk of air, soil, water and noise
pollution is low or non-existent. This report does not
therefore provide any information on these subjects.

In relation to these risks of pollution or nuisance that
Somfy Group’s sites are likely to create and the preventive
measures introduced, the amount of provisions and
guarantees for environmental risks is nil.

Given this low level of environmental risk on these sites,
there are no specific resources deployed. The measures
introduced are managed by the facilities departments of
the sites.

General environmental policy

Somfy Activities has a Sustainable Development

Department. This department integrates the resources

and skills necessary for the completion of projects that

come under the heading “Planet”. It oversees a network
of 35 eco-ambassadors who support, in each sector, the
introduction of measures resulting from the Sustainable

Development policy.

In 2013, Somfy Activities redefined its priorities regarding

its environmental policy. The major projects completed in

2012 facilitated a better understanding of the challenges

and focuses on which it could take action.

The Carbon Test® completed in 2012 identified as a

priority work on electricity consumption and the use of raw

materials.

Both the requirements of our markets and regulations

reinforced the need to better understand the substances

used in our products.

The eco-design of products was therefore identified as a

priority area.

New requirements for eco-design were identified for

integration into the specifications of new products. These

requirements cover three topics:

— Controlled greenhouse gas emissions,

— Materials selected for their low impact on health and the
environment,

— Anavailable statement of the environmental impacts in line
with the PEP ecopassport® programme. Somfy Activities
has signed up to the PEP Eco Passport programme.
This programme, developed by the electricity industry,
defines a standardised method for making environmental
declarations in accordance with international regulations
(ISO 14025 & ISO 14040s).

Also in the field of eco-design, Sirem has put onto the

market a new range of swimming pool pumps, S Series,

with electricity consumption that is 10 to 20% lower than
market norms.

SOMFY - 2013 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

The work begun in 2012 on collection and processing

networks for end-of-life products continued in 2013,

for products in the professional sector, representing the

majority of the volumes put on the market:

— In France, through a contract signed with RECYLUM, an
organisation authorised to process professional WEEE.
This is the result of an industry approach in which Somfy
Group was a stakeholder;

- In Germany, — through
“ElektroAltgeraete Register”.

In 2013, Somfy Group continued to introduce eco-gestures

and eco-practices:

— An electric vehicle was thus introduced for distributing
mail between the various sites in the Haute-Savoie region
in France;

— A partnership was agreed with Corabio to increase the
percentage of the organic and local products served in
the company restaurant (5% in 2014, 10% in 2015 and
20% in 2016);

- The use of recycled paper was systematised for the
production of printed instructions in France (saving
eq. 29.3 tonnes CO,);

- Introduction of a system to reuse laptops (more than
500 computers processed in 2013). The refurbishment
of these computers is carried out by a company which
employs disabled workers;

— Somfy Germany uses a gas generator, tailored to the
German energy environment, to heat its new warehouses
and to supply electricity to the German network.

Internal communication activities continued in 2013, aimed

at raising awareness amongst Somfy Activities employees

of issues related to the protection of the environment.

These activities took the form of articles in various in-

house publications, both in video and paper format (for

example, in the in-house magazine “Imagine”, distributed
in five languages to all Somfy Activities employees), or in
events at the different Somfy SAS sites, such as micro-
conferences during the Sustainable Development week in

April.

The topics discussed included, amongst others:

— Arrangements introduced in France for the collection and
processing of end-of-life products: collective procedure
introduced in partnership with RECYLUM;

— Results of the survey on commuting which covered all
Somfy SAS staff, and the introduction of a car-pooling
platform;

- Somfy solutions to promote active energy efficiency
in buildings. TaHoma is the home automation system
developed by Somfy Group. It particularly provides the
option to monitor energy consumption within the home.

Zurfluh-Feller put into service a system to concentrate and

stabilise its emissions on surface treatment lines. This led to

a reduction in the quantity of waste produced.

Initiatives to optimise production means and_ heating

management led to a reduction in gas usage.

Sustainable use of resources

Water

Water consumption of the sites is limited to sanitary consumption. There is no manufacturing process that is likely to
exhaust local water resources or that depends on a limited water supply.
Zurflh-Feller is unusual in that it uses water from a private pond for its industrial processes.

In 2018, Zurfllh-Feller carried out modernisation work for monitoring and regulating its heating.

SITEM conducted an energy audit of its buildings and compressors; air conditioning management systems were put in
place.

Measures to improve the performance of BFT’s boilers led to a reduction in gas and electricity consumption.

Land use

There are no mining operations on any Somfy Group's
sites.

Our plants have HOSHIN or 5S workshops in order to
optimise the footprint of the sites. A team of specialists,
integrated into the Group's Industrial Management, is
dedicated to leading these projects at the Group's plants.

Adapting to the consequences
of climate change

Our industrial activities do not present any risks linked to
climate change, whether they relate to the growing scarcity
of water, rising sea levels or the rise in temperature.

Protection of biodiversity

No site is located within or bordering a protected area that
requires specific measures.

Nevertheless, Somfy SAS owns several sites in the heart of
the French Alps, near Mont Blanc. Somfy Group wants to
act to protect the mountain’s eco-systems and is involved
in local initiatives such as the “Club d’Entreprises pour la
Montagne et son Développement Durable” (CEM2D) (Club
of businesses supporting the mountain and its sustainable
development). A charter was notably developed in 2013.

Economic and social territorial impact
of the company’s activity

Employment and regional development

Leader in its fields of activity, Somfy Group contributes
to local employment in all the areas where it is located.
Thus, in 2013 the opening of a new industrial site SOPEM
in Poland created 100 new jobs. In Tunisia, production
company SITEM which has a workforce of 879, recruited
53 new employees.

In 2013, Somfy Group’s ambition and intention was to
continue creating jobs in France and particularly in the
Rhdéne-Alpes region, where its business has traditionally
been located. Somfy Group is a provider of direct
employment in its research and development centres,
its production facilities (more than 200 people recruited
between 2011 and 2013 including 30 in production) and
the service divisions located throughout France. Somfy
Group also contributes indirectly to job creation via its sub-
contractors and suppliers (more than 4,650 indirect jobs
created in Europe).

SOMFY - 2013 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

On neighbouring and local populations

In order to promote regional development, Somfy Group
has committed to support the lives of schools and higher
education establishments in the Rhéne-Alpes region. In this
way, Somfy Group is a founding member of the Partner
Companies Club of the Universities of Savoie (“Club des
Entreprises Partenaires des Universités de Savoie”). In
2013, Somfy Group welcomed students from this university
on work placement or work-study contracts.

Since 2012, Somfy Group has chaired the Board of the
Ecole Polytech Annecy Chambéry; the University of
Savoie’s engineering school.

Somfy Group is heavily involved in technology clusters and
competitiveness centres active in the Arve valley (Haute-
Savoie), where the Group’s historical sites are located.
Somfy Group is an active participant in Thésame, the
technological network for mechatronics businesses, sharing
experiences with other local companies, and collaborating
in the development of several strategic projects. Somfy
Group is also a member of the Public Interest Group
MIND, an innovative Franco-Swiss platform specialised in
the field of mechatronics. Alongside other companies, the
CNRS (National Scientific Research Centre) and the Swiss
Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology, Somfy Group
is involved in developing links between businesses and
research centres.

A sponsor of the French Biathlon Teams since 2005,
Somfy Group sought to exercise its responsibilities towards
athletes by helping them to prepare for their post sporting
careers. With the help of companies and the General
Council of the Haute-Savoie region, Somfy Group created
the organisation Rebondir, to support the region's athletes
in their career transition.

Relationships with people or organisations
interested in the company’s activity

In 2013, le Groupe carried out a comprehensive mapping
of its stakeholders in order to better understand the
challenges and expectations of each of them, and to
identify those of them which are the company’s priority. In
2014, this mapping will be forwarded to the Group's senior
management.

In 2013, Somfy Group maintained a regular and constructive

dialogue with priority stakeholders and in particular its

employees, shareholders, investors, customers, suppliers
and regional authorities.

— As part of the Group’s Human Resources policy, several
tools to promote dialogue were implemented with
employees at a collective and individual level: satisfaction
and commitment surveys, and individual interviews and
employee appraisals. Staff representatives and managers
also completed training in responsible social dialogue.

— In relation to shareholders, compliance with governance
rules ensures a structured dialogue on the Group's
performance targets and its strategy.

— For investors, Somfy Group has spent the year rolling
out an action plan to provide them with reliable and high
quality information.

— The Suppliers Quality System includes an information
and exchange mechanism covering topics including
social and environmental responsibility.

— Being responsive to professional customers and end
users is a strategic priority for Somfy Group. For each
customer profile, Somfy Group has developed dialogue
activities - studies, surveys, training, services — tailored
to the expectations of these stakeholders.

— Involved in the development of the areas in which the
Group is located, Somfy Group has promoted dialogue
in France with the various levels of public decision-
making to contribute to structured policies in the areas
of education, the use of research and_ sustainable
development or to support cultural and sporting projects
for local people.

Sub-contracting and suppliers

Suppliers and sub-contracting are important for Somfy

Group due to the nature of its industrial activity which is

essentially assembly. Indeed, all the components that form

part of the composition of the products are purchased
components.

In order to make progress in relation to responsible

purchasing, Somfy Group, in collaboration with other

manufacturers, has developed a maturity frame of reference
in relation to collective and responsible purchasing: this
framework incorporates the central issues of the standard,

ISO 26000.

This work was carried out within the framework of PEAK,

a business Research and Training network aimed at

developing collaborative customer supplier relationships.

Somfy Activities has begun to introduce measures to make

sure that its suppliers and sub-contractors are socially and

environmentally responsible.

Thus, Somfy Activities has auditors who assess suppliers

prior to their admittance to the panel. These audits are

conducted on the basis of a questionnaire that includes
questions on the following topics:

— Existence of an environmental policy,

- Planning to ensure that products
environmental requirements,

— Existence of a health and safety policy and consideration
of ergonomic and safety aspects in the design of
workstations.

These questions are rated, with the ratings forming part of

the final assessment score of the supplier.

If significant variations are discovered, relating for example

to safety in the workplace, Somfy Group may ask the

supplier to take corrective action.

conform to

36

For every component developed by a supplier, Somfy
Group requests a written undertaking relating to the
European Directives REACH and ROHS.

Fair practices

As part of the growing internationalisation of its activities,
Somfy Group is finalising the setting up of an Ethics Charter
which will set out the Group’s policy in regard to tackling
corruption, compulsory or forced labour and the respect
of human rights, freedom of association and the right to
collective bargaining. The Group has the ambition to issue
it to all Group employees.

Measures promoting consumer health
and safety

Ensuring the safety of the users of its products is a top
priority for Somfy Group. Alongside other leading companies
in the electrical industry and the building shutters sector,
Somfy Group is heavily involved in standardisation in order
to ensure that the good safety practices implemented in
relation to product development are maintained. This action
operates on an international (IEC standards), European
(CENELEC and CEN standards) or local (UL standard for
the United States for example) scale.

To show that its products comply with safety standards,
Somfy Group's products are accredited by independent
bodies in its different territories (VDE, NF, SASO, UL, etc.).
Somfy Group acquired a quality system enabling it to
ensure that its products comply with the standards and
requirements in place within its markets.

To control the performance and safety of its product
installations, Somfy Group has developed a network of
expert installers throughout the areas in which the Group
is located. These specialists benefit from professional
training to help ensure that the products are installed under
optimum safety conditions both for the installer and users.
Somfy Group trained more than 7,000 professionals in
France in 2013.

Every product is accompanied by usage and safety
instructions.

A citizen’s policy involving employees

The main task for the Fondation Somfy has been to

implement Somfy Group's citizen’s policy. Its fields of

intervention are centered around the fight against poor

housing, in parallel with Somfy Activities’ strategic mission

to improve living environment.

In 2013, the Foundation’s budget of € 300,000 was used

to finance three main types of action:

= Confirmation of support for the Emmatis France charity,
with the renewal of an annual agreement providing for a
financial contribution to Emmatis communities’ building
rehabilitation projects,


--- Page 27 ---

— The creation of an online crowd funding platform (www.
lespetitespierres.org) enabling anyone to donate to
community projects in the area of access to decent
housing,

- The development of a participation programme for
Somfy Group employees, “Time for Others” (“Un Temps
pour les Autres”). In 2013, 108 employees took part in
community projects on behalf of associations during
their working hours.

Methodology note

Reporting protocol

Somfy Groups’ CSR reporting protocol is the reference
guide for all those involved in CSR reporting within the
Group. It is drawn up in French and English. Its purpose
is to define all the Group’s CSR indicators along with their
method of calculation, and to describe the procedures for
their collection and for reporting in order to promote the
consistency and comparability of data. This document is
distributed to and applied at all levels of data preparation
and reporting. The reporting protocol is updated annually
to take into account Group developments.

The CSR reporting protocol also serves as a reference
framework for the external verification of data, in
accordance with Article L. 225-102-1 of the Commercial
Code (“Grenelle 2” Law). It is available on request from
Head Office.

Selection of indicators

Somfy Group’s indicators were defined by the CSR officers
for each area in line with the Group’s CSR strategy and
the resulting social, environmental and social objectives.
They facilitate the monitoring of the CSR policy’s progress
in each of the improvement areas identified by the Group
and the transparent communication of the Group’s CSR
performance in this report.

The indicators used comply with the Grenelle Il decree
and are based on the general principles of the GRI (Global
Reporting Initiative) guidelines.

Collection, internal control
and consolidation

The collection of CSR indicators is ensured by the CSR
officers within their respective fields of expertise. They rely
on their network of local experts who provide the data.
The CSR officers are also responsible for the consistency
and plausibility of the data prior to its consolidation in order
to generate the Group indicators included in the CSR
section of the management report.

SOMFY - 2013 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

Reporting period

The data collected covers the period from 1 January to 31

December 2013.

Reporting scope

Companies which are controlled by the Group and fully
consolidated within the financial reporting scope are
included within the reporting scope. The concept of control
means the power to govern the financial and operational
policies of an affiliated company so as to benefit from its
operations. Control is generally deemed to exist where the
Group holds more than half of the controlled company’s
voting rights.

Newly acquired companies are integrated into the reporting
scope following a probationary period necessary for the
introduction of reporting.

Companies which were sold during the financial year are
not included within the reporting scope.

Specifics of the scope for 2013 reporting:

The reporting scope taken into account for the 2013
financial year was restricted to the following entities:

— Zurflulh-Feller (France),

— SITEM SARL (Tunisia),

= LianDa (China),

= Somfy GmbH (Germany),

— Somfy Systems Inc. (US),

- BFT SpA (ltaly).

For reasons of access to information, the other Group
companies have not been included. Collection of
information for the companies concerned which are located
outside French territory will be introduced gradually. The
Group’s aim is to improve its reporting scope over the
coming financial years.

lt may be recalled that the 2012 reporting scope included
the following companies:

— Somfy SAS (France),

= Simu SAS (France),

= Sirem (France),

Methodology limitations

The methodologies used for the reporting of certain CSR indicators may present limitations due to:

— Particularities of local legislation in the various countries in which the Group is located,
— Lack of availability of information on certain scopes,
— Use of estimates in the absence of assessment tools,
— Practicalities of collecting and processing data.

of the Commercial Code)

At 31 December 2013 as at 31 December 2012, there are

Information on risks
(Article L. 225-100
of the Commercial Code)

Financial risks

The main financial risks to which the Somfy Group is
exposed are interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and
liquidity and investment risks.

According to IFRS, all derivative financial instruments are
measured at their fair value. Fair value is either the market
value for listed instruments, or a value provided by financial
institutions in accordance with traditional criteria (over-the-
counter market). The amounts covered exclusively relate
to current or future transactions within the framework of
Somfy Group’s normal business activities.

As part of the transposition of the MIF Directive that came
into force on 1 November 2007, Somfy SA and its French
subsidiaries opted for the “individual clients” category.

Foreign exchange risk

Somfy Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is
primarily related to its operational activities (intragroup
sales of manufactured products distributed by commercial
subsidiaries outside the Euro zone, these sales being
denominated in local currencies and purchases
denominated in local currencies).

Derivative financial instruments are primarily comprised of
forward exchange contracts.

The management of foreign exchange risk is covered in
note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

Interest rate risk

Somfy Group’s interest rate risk originates from its financing
facilities: interest rate hedges related to Somfy Participations’
LBO financial debt and to medium-term borrowings to
secure Somfy SA's working capital requirements.

SOMFY - 2013 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

Somfy Participations’ LBO package liabilities are hedged,
in accordance with contract terms and conditions, by
standard interest rate swaps (swap of variable rates for
fixed rates) hedging against an increase of more than
150 basis points in EURIBOR 3 months, compared to the
available rate.

The management of interest rate risk is covered in note 25
to the consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity risk

The Somfy Group must have permanent access to the

necessary financial resources to allow it to finance its day-

to-day activities and its investments. The Group's liquidity

risk primarily arises from the obligation to repay its existing

debt, the funding of its future resource requirements and

observance of its financial ratios.

Funds made available by the credit institutions are subject

to Somfy’s SA commitment to comply with two types of

financial covenants based on:

= The Group's financial structure (net financial debt/
shareholder’s equity) and,

= Its ability to repay (net financial debt/cash flow and net
financial debt/EBITDA).

For Somfy Participations, each LBO liability is subject to

compliance with covenants contracted at the time the

finance packages were negotiated.

The management of liquidity risk is covered in note 25 to

the consolidated financial statements.

Credit facilities and compliance with covenants are detailed

in note 22.6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Investment risk

The Group’s exposure to investment risk is related to its
cash surplus deposited with banks.

The management of investment risk is covered in note 25
to the consolidated financial statements.

Raw material risks

Somfy Group hedges against the volatility in the price of raw
materials that are significantly used in the manufacturing
of its products by placing firm orders with its suppliers,
depending on market conditions.

Share risks

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury shares,
with their loss in value, due to the fall in the markets,
resulting in the recognition of a tax-deductible provision of
€ 1.3 million. The corresponding € 0.5 million deferred tax
was posted to reserves.

Legal risks

Somfy Group’s operations are not subject to specific
regulations. Its business does not require a specific legal
or regulatory authorisation with the exception of the
compulsory listing on the Register of Companies and stock
exchange regulations.

Somfy Group is involved in a number of disputes in respect
of its business. These should not have any significant
negative impact on the Group's financial position.

To the Group’s knowledge, there were no exceptional
events or litigation likely to have a significant negative
impact on the Group's or its subsidiaries’ operations, assets
or results, other than those mentioned in the highlights of
the financial year.

Insurance — risk coverage

Somfy Group covers the main risks with the following

insurance policies:

— “Property damage”, covering buildings and their contents
(equipment, goods, IT equipment) up to the maximum
amount of damage likely to be incurred;

— “Resulting loss of profit”.

Risks insured by these two policies include, fire, explosions,

lightning, smoke, emissions, steam, impacts from airborne

objects, electrical risks, storms, snow, hail, water damage,
frost, machine breakage, IT equipment theft, natural
disasters and other non-designated events;

— “General civil liability relating to monetary consequences
of an insured entity’s liability following physical injury,
property damage or moral prejudice caused to a third
party during or in relation to its operations”;

= “Directors’ civil liability”;

— “Transported goods”;

— In addition, “Credit” insurance contracts, both in France
and internationally, enable the Group to limit the impact
of customer bad debts. Approximately 60% of sales are
thus insured.

Country risk

The majority of operations occur in safe areas such as
Europe, the United States and Asia.
The Group does not operate
hyperinflationary area.

in any — significant

Climate risk

Due to the nature of the products marketed (notably motors
for blinds), Somfy Group’s activity is partly connected
to weather conditions, in particular during the first half
of the year, during which sales of motors for blinds are
concentrated.

40

Customer credit risk

Customer credit risk is linked to the receivables portfolio
and the sometimes challenging economic environment in
certain parts of the world. Nevertheless, customer profile,
the Group's international geographic presence and the
credit insurance cover help to mitigate this risk.

Customer credit risk analysis is addressed in note 18 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Information

on non-deductible charges
(Articles 39-4 and 223 IV

of the General Tax Code)

The financial statements for the financial year ended
31 December 2013 do not include any non-allowable
charges with regard to the income tax base, as defined by
Articles 39-4 and 223 IV of the General Tax Code.
