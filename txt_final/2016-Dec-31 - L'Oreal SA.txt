SUPPORTED BY STABLE
GOVERNANCE

For over 100 years, L’Oréal has devoted itself to one business:
beauty, in which it is the world’s leading company. It is the

superficial, cosmetics are full of meaning. They give everyone
self-confidence, enable them to blossom and open up to
others and contribute to individual and collective well-being.

Boasting an_ international portfolio of 34 diverse and
complementary brands, the Group responds to all beauty
aspirations worldwide. Present in all distribution channels,
L’Oréal generated sales of €25.84 billion in 2016 thanks to its
89,331 employees across the globe.

THE LOREAL GROUP: FUNDAMENTALS

A balanced and committed Board of Directors,
which plays its role of reflection and strategic
impetus to the full

The Board of Directors determines L'Oréal’s — strategic
orientations and ensures their implementation. It oversees the
management of both the financial and extra-financial aspects,
and ensures the quality of the information provided to the
shareholders and to the market.

The structure of L’Oréal’s Board makes it possible to take into
account the specificities of its shareholding structure while
guaranteeing the interests of all its stakeholders. It comprises
15 members, consisting of the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, Mr. Jean-Paul Agon, five Directors from the Group’s
majority shareholders (the Bettencourt Meyers family with
Mrs. Frangoise Bettencourt Meyers, Mr. Jean-Pierre Meyers and
Mr. Jean-Victor Meyers, and Nestlé with Mr. Peter
Brabeck-Letmathe and Mrs. Béatrice Guillaume-Grabisch),
seven independent Directors (Mrs. Sophie Bellon, Mrs. Belén
Garijo, Mrs. Virginie Morgon, Mrs. Eileen Naughton, Mr.
Charles-Henri Filippi, Mr. Xavier Fontanet, Mr. Bernard Kasriel)
and two Directors representing the employees (Mrs. Ana Sofia
Amaral, Mr. Georges Liarokapis). All of them make sure that
the Board's work is carried out on a collective basis with the
common objective of ensuring the Group's long-term
development.

The Board takes steps to ensure that the Directors are from
different backgrounds, and most of them have international
experience acquired in groups with a global dimension and
complementary skills: industrial, financial, digital and above all
entrepreneurial competencies. The diversity of skills and
expertise on the Board enables it to understand rapidly and in
detail the development issues facing L’Oréal, the leader on a
highly competitive globalised cosmetics market, in a
fast-changing world.

L'Oréal is attentive to compliance with the principle of
balanced gender representation on the Board: 46% of its
members are women, and 2 Committees out of 4 are chaired
by women, the Audit Committee and the Appointments and
Governance Committee.

acquisitions in particular.

The Directors make sure that the decisions taken contribute to
implementation of the strategy.

Wishing to continually enhance its role of reflecting on issues

A CLEAR STRATEGY: BEAUTY FOR ALL

1.2.

A CLEAR STRATEGY: BEAUTY FOR ALL

Demand for beauty is universal. L’Oréal deploys a global strategy to satisfy this demand.

1.2.1. UNIVERSALISATION, TO MEET

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR BEAUTY

L’Oréal relies on a single strategy - Universalisation - meaning
globalisation that respects differences. This strategy aims at
offering beauty attuned to the specific expectations of
consumers in every region of the world. It is based on a keen
ability to listen fo consumers and a profound respect for their
differences.

This is why the Group’s Research and Marketing teams pay
heed to all consumers and laboratories on all continents study
their specificities. The innovation policy is based on
affordability and on the adaptation of products to the beauty
rituals and lifestyles of all men and women in their infinite
diversity.

12 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / LORE

1.2.2. AN INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE

Founded in France in 1909, the Group developed rapidly in
Western Europe. In 2016, it generated 32.1% of its cosmetics
sales on this historical territory. To make Universalisation a really
powerful strategy, the global market has been organised into
5 large homogeneous strategic regions, even more attentive
to consumers and closer to their desires.

The Group's organisation is now resolutely multi-centric, with a
strong “nerve centre” based in France. Each major region of
the world now has its own centre of expertise which groups
together Research and Marketing activities. Research therefore
has 6 hubs across the globe, led by central teams and fuelled
by the Group's core expertise and fundamental knowledge.

After anchoring itself in Western Europe, L’Oréal gained a
foothold in North America in the first half of the 20" century.
Initially, the Group entrusted distribution companies with
commercializing its products, these companies being united
in 1953 around an exclusive agent, Cosmair. Following
Cosmair's takeover in 1994, the Group developed in North
America with the status of a subsidiary. The acquisition of
brands such as Maybelline (1996), Matrix and Kiehl's (2000),
Urban Decay (2012), or more recently NYX Professional
Makeup (2014) and IT Cosmetics (2016) have considerably
reinforced its presence in North America. In 2016, its sales on
that continent increased by 5.8% like-for-like, and represent
28.5% of world cosmetic sales.

Beginning in the 1970s, the Latin America Zone developed with
a multi-divisional organisation that the Group has since
adopted in the other major regions of the world.

Present in Japan for nearly 50 years, L’Oréal has expanded its
presence in the country by choosing the brands to be given
priority for this extremely specific market: Kérastase in hair
salons, Lancéme in Luxury products and Maybelline and
L’Oréal Paris in mass-market products.

The 1990s witnessed the opening up of New Markets with very
strong development in Eastern Europe. At the same time, the
Group extended its activities to more distant markets like India
or China.

L'Oréal was among the first foreign groups to obtain an
authorisation from the Indian government in 1994 to create a
wholly-owned subsidiary with its registered office in Mumbai.

In 1997, the Group created a large multi-divisional zone in Asia
and opened new subsidiaries, particularly in China where
L’Oréal holds all of the capital of its entity.

Africa and the Middle East, where the Group lacked a strong
presence, became a new frontier for development.

The mid 2000s were another turning point: a sharp
acceleration in growth of the New Markets led to a shift in the
economic world’s centre of gravity.

In total, the percentage of cosmetics sales generated by the
Group in the New Markets was 15.5% in 1995, 27.1% in 2006
and 39.4% in 2016. Sales in New Markets increased greatly as a

proportion of the Group's total sales between 2006 and 2016.
This trend is expected to continue.

The Group has a well-balanced geographical footprint across
most of the world’s main markets.

The New Markets show considerable growth potential: in many
countries, the consumption of cosmetics products per
inhabitant is 10 fo 20 times lower than in mature countries.
Every year across the globe, several tens of millions of people
gain access to income levels that make them part of the
“middle classes”, enabling them to afford modern cosmetics
products.

THE BEAUTY MARKET, HUGE DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL

The worldwide cosmetics market is worth approximately
€205 billion and grew by an estimated +4.0% “ in 2016. It is a
particularly robust market which is steadily expanding while
proving very resilient during difficult economic times. The
cosmetics consumer always looks for quality and novelty
value, and puts a premium on leading-edge technology,
trends and new ideas. The cosmetics market remains a
supply-led market driven by innovation, where consumers are
always on the look-out for quality, performance and perceived
results.

From a geographic viewpoint, the New Markets continued to
spearhead growth in the beauty sector. Asia, Pacific, the
world’s biggest cosmetics market, remained as buoyant as
ever, in particular on the back of acceleration in the countries
of Southeast Asia which offset the slight slowdown in China.

The situation in the mature markets continued to be uneven
with a dynamic market in North America while the climate in

1.2.4. A PORTFOLIO OF DIVERSE AND COMPLEMENTARY BRANDS

To meet the beauty expectations of consumers all over the
world, the Group has the richest, most varied and most
powerful brand portfolio in the cosmetics industry. Moreover, its
brands are constantly being reinvented so that they are
always a perfect match with consumer demand.

New acquisitions also regularly provide valuable additions to
this unique portfolio.

Some of these acquisitions are of global brands such as the US
make-up brands Urban Decay and IT Cosmetics, a
tremendous contribution to L’Oréal Luxe; or NYX Professional

(1) Source: Beauty's top 100, WWD, April 2016.

Makeup, an affordable, make-up artist-inspired brand; or
Decléor and Carita, which extend the growth potential of
Professional Products to the field of professional skincare.

Other acquisitions are aimed at extending the Group’s
geographical footprint: in Colombia with the make-up brand
Vogue, in Kenya with Interbeauty, and also in Brazil with Niely
Cosmeticos, and in China with Magic Holdings.

These newly acquired companies are helping to accelerate
the Group’s penetration of their markets, and help to drive
organic growth going forward.

Competitive positions and market share held by the Group’s Divisions and brands mentioned in this Document are based on studies, panels and polls
obtained from specialised organisations and companies, or, in the absence of comprehensive studies, are the result of estimates made by L’Oréal on

the basis of available statistical data.

The leading research force in the cosmetics
industry

Eugéne Schueller founded L’Oréal thanks fo a major
innovation: harmless hair dye. Research was therefore already
written in the Group's genes and quickly became one of the
keys to its success. To invent beauty and accommodate the
aspirations of millions of men and women, L’Oréal continues to
push back the boundaries of science. This commitment to
innovation remains unwavering: to offer everyone, everywhere
in the world, the best of cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy
and safety. The Group's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)
focuses are a source of new innovation opportunities rather
than a mere set of constraints.

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION ADAPTED TO THE WORLD’S MARKETS

Research adapted to the market

To respond as best as possible to the demands of consumers
across the world, L’Oréal’s research teams have a global
presence through its 20 cosmetic research centres and its
16 evaluation centres. The research centres are grouped
together in 3 global centres in France (Advanced Research,
Hair métiers and Cosmetic métiers) and 6 regional hubs: in the
United States, Japan, China, Brazil, India and South Africa.
These regional hubs identify the needs of consumers and their
cosmetic practices. The richness of their scientific ecosystem
promotes cooperation and partnerships for excellence. All the
data collected enables the researchers to develop new
products that are perfectly in phase with local expectations
and aspirations.

A pertinent multi-hub organisation

Thanks to their close proximity to consumers, the hubs innovate
with genuine local relevance and nourish the global flow of
innovations. Through a co-operation with the China hub,
Research and Innovation has successfully developed
shampoos with a reduced environmental impact as well as
masks and anti-hair loss treatments that prevent hair
whitening. Together with the India hub, it focuses on
progressive, oil-based hair colours and mineralite-oased
treatments for shiny skin. Research and Innovation and the
Japan hub teams identify materials with optical effects to
innovate in make-up. In the USA, they develop connected
objects and have set themselves the challenge of putting on a
chip the interactions between human organs, using a cross
between cell engineering and microfluidics. Brazil puts the
emphasis on airlicium-based bodycare products, deodorants
and antiperspirants. Finally, a new hub has been set up in
Johannesburg in South Africa to develop specific hair colours,
nourishing hair care products, hair straighteners, and specially
adapted make-up ranges.

Ethically respectful research

To respond to the essential requirements of product safety, in
the 1980s the research team began to develop alternative
methods which did not use animal testing in order to assess
the safety of its products and ingredients. Major progress was
made thanks to tissue engineering: the reconstruction of the
first human epidermis in 1979 and the first complete skin
(epidermis and dermis) in 1996.

The Group has acquired extensive expertise in this field owing
to four decades of international scientific co-operation. A total
of 12 reconstructed skin and corneal tissue models have now
been developed, while five alternatives to animal testing have
been approved.

These models are fabulous tools for predicting product safety
and efficacy and for reducing time-to-market. Thanks to these
models, L'Oréal was able to stop testing finished products on
animals in 1989 and to develop predictive evaluation
strategies fo satisfy European regulations prohibiting the
offering for sale of products containing any ingredient that has
been tested on animals after March 11", 2013. This quest to
assess safety better without using animal testing led to the
creation of a subsidiary in Lyon, Episkin, which produces and
sells validated reconstructed skin models. This commitment
spread across the world in response to international legal and
regulatory changes such as those in Brazil, India, China, etc.
via the creation of subsidiaries (Shanghai  Episkin
Biotechnology Co. Ltd) and the training sessions delivered by
the Episkin Academy.

Presentation of the Group - Integrated report
A CLEAR STRATEGY: BEAUTY FOR ALL

Furthermore, to protect its lead in skin engineering, L'Oréal
implements the latest cutting-edge technologies: exploring the
potential of microfluidic systems with organs-on-a-chip in
partnership with the University of Central Florida which puts 4 of
them on the same chip, reinnervating the reconstructed
human epidermis in collaboration with the IDOR research
institute in Brazil, and, together with biotechnology company
Poietis, taking on the novel scientific challenge of bioprinting a
hair follicle using a bioprinter.

Towards ever more sustainable innovation

Within the framework of its Sharing Beauty With All programme
launched in 2013 (see section 3.2.1), one of the main
commitments made by L’Oréal with regard to Sustainable
Development consists in improving the environmental or social
profile of 100% of its products by 2020. This is a major paradigm
shift: from now on, whenever the Group’s teams invent or
update a product, they take account not only of the product's
performance and its profitability, but also its contribution to
sustainability. To do this, they act on at least one of the
following criteria:

@ reduction of the environmental footprint, particularly its
water footprint, or improvement in biodegradability;

¢ use of renewable raw materials, that are sustainability
sourced or derived from green chemistry;

positive social impact through the incorporation of raw
materials from the Solidarity sourcing programmes (see
section 3.2.4.3);

@ improvement of the environmental profile of new or
updated packaging.

In this way, 82% of L’Oréal products launched in 2016 have an
improved environmental or social profile (as against 74% in
2015)

Some of the new products launched in 2016 have
biodegradability levels of over 98% across the L’Oréal Group’s
various brands, such as, for example, Kérastase Aura Botanica
soin fondamental or concentré essentiel, the shampoos and
conditioners of the Matrix Biolage RAW range, the
Roger&Gallet Aura Mirabilis ultra-thin clean mask or the
Lancéme Absolue Precious Oil.

Research unveils the territories of tomorrow

Ageing beautifully by integrating exposome data

Exposome is defined as the measure of the cumulative effects
of all environmental, internal and behavioural factors to which
human beings are exposed throughout their lifetime. The skin,
our protective barrier, is directly subject to environmental
aggressions (UV rays, pollution) but also reflects internal stress
factors such as fatigue, anxiety or unbalanced diets. L’Oréal’s
researchers have demonstrated that the effects of UV radiation
are made worse by pollution, and that clinical signs of aging
were reversible through products combining UVB and UVA
filters with powerful antioxidants like baicalin.

With its 10th member, the Scientific Advisory Board
is opening the way to regeneration

Created in 2013 to explore the future boundaries of beauty
and chaired by Jacques Leclaire, the Group's Global Scientific
Director, this year the Scientific Advisory Board focused its work
on the rapidly growing field of regenerative medicine. In 2016,

it also welcomed its tenth member, Clément Sanchez, the
holder of the Chair in chemistry of hybrid materials at the
Collége de France, who will provide original ideas in the
search for new materials offering immediately visible effects on
skin and hair.

1.2.6. OPERATIONS, EXPERTISE AND
SERVICES CLOSE TO CONSUMERS

The Operations Division harnesses the most advanced, agile,
effective and connected technological expertise, from
packaging design and product development, sourcing and
production through to distribution of all the Group’s products,
in order to enable the brands to offer consumers worldwide the
very latest cosmetic solutions.

Assuming its fundamental responsibilities, the Operations
Division guarantees consumers compliance with © strict
standards of quality, safety, security and societal and
environmental responsibility all over the world.


--- Page 14 ---

At the centre of design and development,
innovation of packaging

The packaging of a product is the first identifying link between
a brand and its consumers. Beyond its technical performance
and its function, packaging is a key differentiating factor for
the product and therefore for the value perceived by the
consumer. Every year, L’Oréal’s teams of design and
development specialists provide cutting-edge innovations with
3 centres of expertise: Europe, Asia and the Americas. In 2016,
L'Oréal filed 88 patents for packaging and process.

L'Oréal increasingly uses digital technologies more and more
in the design and development of its packaging, to offer
consumers connected, smart beauty products and services
that meet their specific needs.

A Purchasing programme combining
economic and social value

To accompany the Group's growth - both from a
geographical and technological standpoint - the Purchasing
teams select the suppliers in accordance with the L’Oréal Buy
and Care responsible purchasing programme. They manage
their performance by monitoring precise indicators relating to
social, environmental and ethical criteria and through their

ability to innovate and to meet the Group’s requirements in
terms of quality, service and competitiveness.

L'Oréal builds solid relationships with its suppliers and this
makes it possible to work with them on their supply chains and
thus ensure the reliability and traceability of sourcing (for raw
materials and packaging). In 2016, the Group conducted
1,187 social audits, making a total of more than 8,200 since
2006.

Furthermore, by creating the responsible purchasing
programme called Solidarity Sourcing, L'Oréal chose as from
2010 to commit to work with suppliers with a_ solidarity
approach, for example those giving access to work for
disabled workers, people from underprivileged backgrounds
or fair trade suppliers (see the paragraph on Solidarity
Sourcing 3.2.4.3.).

An industrial performance which relies on a
global system of operational excellence

L'Oréal has 42 plants spread all over the world, in close
proximity to the markets, that have the ability to adapt to local
specificities and to support the drive to win over new
consumers.

A CLEAR STRATEGY: BEAUTY FOR ALL

Product quality and safety: a priority

The Group has set up a single product quality and safety
management programme on a worldwide basis, which
uniformly guarantees compliance with the Group's
commitments. It comprises production methods and effective
Internal Control methods throughout the product
manufacturing cycle. On average, 100 compliance checks
are carried out on the same product.

This quality process led to a low rate of consumer claims in
2016: 52 complaints per million products.

Operational excellence

L’Oréal has high-tech industrial facilities - using robotisation,
automation, cobotics (collaborative robotics)- that are
flexible to operate according to market demands and
consumer needs: from a high productivity plant engaged in
large-scale production to an agile plant proposing limited
quantities, and also a plant producing devices.

The Group is continuing to roll out its Operational Excellence
System in all its plants to meet the challenges of a constantly
changing world and go even further in adapting its industrial
facilities to the needs of consumers. This process is based on
the close involvement of all employees in technical and
technological areas relating to safety, quality, ergonomics,
environmental impact and production capacity, while at the
same time controlling costs.

In 2016, the areas for improvement of economic performance
notably concerned an increase in productivity with
investments in equipment for the plant of the future
(industry 4.0).

At the heart of production: environmental
protection

The Group’s environmental policy looks to roll out best
practices with regard to sustainable production in order to
preserve resources: energy efficiency, use of renewable
energy, optimisation of water consumption and its recycling,
reduction of waste generation, etc. Results in 2016 once again
show L’Oréal's ability to decouple growth in production (+29%)
from its environmental impact with, since 2005, CO, emissions
down -67% in absolute value, water consumption down -48%
per finished product and waste generation down -35% per
finished product. It should be noted that 98% of residual waste
was recovered in 2016, meaning that it was reused, recycled
or used for energy recovery.

Mi Waste generation CO, emissions

Through the commitments for 2020 made under the Sharing
Beauty With All programme, the Group continues to pursue the
process initiated in 2009 aimed at reducing its environmental
footprint. 15 of L'Oréal’s industrial sites were “carbon neutral”
at the end of 2016, as against 9 sites at the end of 2015:
5 plants (Libramont in Belgium, Settimo in Italy, Burgos in Spain,
Rambouillet in France and Yichang in China)
and 10 distribution centres.

L’Oréal was given the best rating - a score of “A” - three times
in 2016 by the CDP in each of the essential fields of
environmental protection: the fight against climate change,
sustainable water management and the fight against
deforestation. Only 2 companies (out of nearly 3,000) in the
world received this distinction in 2016.

(1) The CDP is an independent NGO which offers a global system for the measurement and publication of environmental information and which assesses
the strategy, close involvement and results obtained by companies in the fight against climate change, sustainable water management and forest

protection.

The Supply chain at the service of consumers

The L’Oréal Group's Supply Chain has the task of organising
and optimising all information flows and physical flows of
products from the point of sale to the supplier. It ensures that
the right product is delivered at the right time, in accordance
with the expectations of the consumer, while controlling costs.

An omnichannel supply chain

L'Oréal is characterised by a unique particularity on the
cosmetics market: its ability to handle a wide variety of product
categories and an omnichannel presence in all distribution
channels (hair salons, mass-market retail channels,

perfumeries, pharmacies, drugstores, medispas, branded
retail, travel retail, e-commerce).

With the growing demands of its customers and consumers
(personalisation, service, etc.) and the rising importance of
e-commerce and L'Oréal’s branded retail, the supply chain is
at the heart of the products and services offered by its brands.
It is becoming more agile to handle market variations on all
distribution channels and to adapt to local consumer
requirements.

A distribution network suited to the markets

The geographical location of the 153 distribution centres
enables the Group to be as close as possible to its direct
delivery points and its distributor customers. In 2016, several
projects for the modernisation of the physical distribution
network were conducted to enhance agility. After North
America and Western Europe, automation of the centres is
continuing in Australia and Germany.

The Group is continuing to invest in the performance of its
information systems in order to continually improve the ability
to adjust the physical distribution network to market
requirements.

Global economic performance at the service
of the brands and the commercial entities

Operations have major economic responsibility for all the
brands and markets and that impact total product costs.

The Division’s economic optimisation efforts led by Operations
involve tracking the total landed cost, i.e., the final full cost of a
product, which includes the cost of packaging and raw
materials, the value added by the plants and all supply chain
costs.

LASTING DEVELOPMEN

1.3.1. 2016 RESULTS*

L’Oréal achieved another good year, with a significant
growth in sales and robust profits.

In a generally favourable cosmetics market, the Group
has once again accentuated its worldwide beauty
leadership thanks to market share gains in its three main
geographic zones.

All the Divisions recorded sales growth, especially L’Oréal
Luxe which is significantly strengthening its positions. The
Active Cosmetics Division also performed well, winning
market share around the world. As announced, the
Consumer Products Division, driven by its successful
strategic choices, saw a clear acceleration in sales and
outperformed its market.

As for the geographic zones, L’Oréal has accelerated
sales and increased its lead in North America. The
Group has further accentuated its leadership in Europe,
outperforming the market despite the difficult situation in
France. Growth in the New Markets has remained solid

In terms of results, operating margin and cash flows
have set new records, confirming that L’Oréal business
model is set to deliver robust performance and create
significant value.

2016 was also another year that strengthened L’Oréal’s
leadership in connected beauty. The e-commerce “
sales rose by +33%, and the digital dynamism of brands
- in both communications and services - means they
can develop increasingly strong and personalised
interactions with consumers.

The strategic acquisition of IT Cosmetics, and the one in
progress of CeraVe, strengthen the unique portfolio of
brands and will more than ever enable to meet the
consumers’ beauty aspirations. As part of this brand
portfolio optimisation, it has been decided to explore all
strategic options regarding The Body Shop’s ownership
in order to give it the best opportunities and full ability to
continue its development. No decision has been taken
so far.

Multi-division summary by geographic zone

Western Europe

Despite the continuing difficult environment in France, Western
Europe posted growth of +2.4% like-for-like, and +0.5% based
on reported figures, and is further extending its leadership. The
Consumer Products Division is strengthening its positions. The
United Kingdom and Spain had a particularly dynamic year,
while Germany and Italy delivered solid growth, outperforming
their respective markets. Make-up is the number one growth
driver, fuelled especially by the NYX Professional Makeup and
Urban Decay brands.

North America

In a dynamic market, North America posted growth of +5.8%
like-for-like and +6.7% based on reported figures. L'Oréal Luxe is
growing faster than its market, driven by the strong growth of

Micellar Cleansing Waters launches.

New Markets

¢ Asia, Pacific: this Zone recorded growth of +3.6% like-for-like
and +1.8% based on reported figures. In Northern Asia,
Taiwan and South Korea are posting good growth. In
China, L’Oréal Luxe maintains its momentum, but the
Consumer Products Division, in a transitional phase, has
been slowed down by the difficulties of Magic and the
progressive adjustment to the evolving distribution
channels. In Southern Asia, growth remains sustained
thanks, in particular, to dynamic trends in Australia and
Indonesia, and the development of NYX Professional
Makeup and Garnier;

¢ Latin America: the Zone posted growth of +11.1%
like-for-like, and -1.8% based on reported figures. The
acceleration is continuing in Mexico, Colombia and Peru,
thanks to the strong growth of the make-up brands Vogue,
Maybelline and L'’Oréal Paris, and the good results of
L'Oréal Professionnel and Kérastase. In Brazil, the Active
Cosmetics Division is outperforming the market, and the
Consumer Products Division is taking advantage of the
successful integration of Niely;

Eastern Europe: the Zone recorded growth of +10.4%

very strong momentum. Against this background, the
Divisions together have gained market shares.

The Body Shop

The Body Shop recorded growth of +0.6% like-for-like, and -4.8%
based on reported figures. Momentum was good in Europe,
especially in the United Kingdom, the brand's home market,
and in Latin America where The Body Shop opened up
recently in Chile. The brand has also benefited from sustained
growth in e-commerce. Skincare growth is continuing, with a
strong contribution from the range of five new facial skincare
masks. The difficult context in Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong,
however, is continuing to impact overall performance.

basis and are inherent to the Group's activities in the
cosmetics industry. To capture new market share, in-depth
research must be conducted all over the world, and
advertising and promotional expenses need to be
attuned to the familiarity of the brands and _ their
competitive position. Lastly, investments in point-of sale
(POS) advertising materials ensure optimal presence for
our brands in points of sale.

For reasons relating to strategy and competition, L'Oréal
cannot therefore provide any systematic information on future
investments

In 2016, the Group's investments totalled €1,386 million, or 5.4%
of its sales. This level reflects the Group's constant efforts in
terms of improving industrial efficiency, research and digital
development performance and enhancing brand value.

Investment commitments in 2016 can be broken down as
follows:

production and the supply chain represent approximately
26% of total investments;

marketing investments, including moulds, POS advertising
materials and stores account for 44%;

¢ IT investments spread over all these categories represent
18% of total investments.

research and the head offices in different countries
account for the remainder.

See notes 3.2.2, 7.2 et 13.2 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for more details of these investments.

Despite their strategic nature, none of these investments taken
individually is material enough at Group level fo warrant more
detailed disclosure.

1.3.2. CONSTANT, SHARED GROWTH

Priority to human capital

L'Oréal has always been guided by humanist values that have
led it to place the individual and talent at the very heart of its
organisation. As its founder, Eugéne Schueller affirmed with
conviction “a company is not walls and machines but men,
men and more men.”

These strategic intangible assets are one of the Group’s main
competitive advantages in the long term, alongside its brands,
governance and Research.

The Group’s human and social project revolves around two
priorities: the first is individual performance development of
employees and future leaders and the second is social
performance.

L’Oréal has always targeted constant, sustainable growth.

Since its very beginnings, the Group has been committed to
developing its presence in all regions of the world by applying
the fundamental rules of a good corporate citizen. The
products offered to consumers meet the highest quality
standards; the Group's social commitments are the same in all
its subsidiaries; all production centres comply with the same
rules aimed at reducing their environmental footprint. Social
audits are carried out at the suppliers of plants and distribution
centres.

Each subsidiary participates, as far as its resources allow, in
the major programmes of the L'Oréal Foundation, particularly
For Women in Science and Beauty for a Better Life or the
Group’s corporate philanthropy projects like Hairdressers
against AIDS (see chapter 3). Above and beyond its solid
long-term economic performances, the Company seeks to be

exemplary and sets itself demanding standards in order to limit
its environmental footprint. In October 2013, all the L'Oréal
Group's Sustainable Development commitments were formally
provided for and structured at a strategic level within the
scope of the Sharing Beauty With All programme.

Sharing Beauty With All

The Sharing Beauty With All programme presents the targets
that the Group has set itself for 2020 with the aim of reducing
its environmental impact and_ increasing its social
commitments, while sharing its growth with the surrounding
communities. Every year, L'Oréal reports on its strategy and its
results transparently and giving figures via performance
indicators. A panel of independent international experts called
the Panel of Critical Friends meets once a year to review
progress made and take a critical look at the actions taken
and suggest improvements.

The Sharing Beauty With All programme stands out for its
complete integration into the Company's value chains it
therefore covers all the Group’s impacts, broken down into
four areas:

@ innovating sustainably, which aims at improving the
environmental and social profile of products;

producing sustainably, to reduce the environmental
footprint of the Group's plants and distribution centres, all
over the world (see section 1.2.6);

¢ living sustainably, to engage with consumers and offer
them the possibility fo make sustainable consumption
choices;

¢ developing sustainably to share growth with all the Group's
stakeholders (employees, suppliers, communities).

Presentation of the Group — Integrated report
GOOD GROWTH MOMENTUM FOR SHARED, LASTING DEVELOPMENT *

“By 2020, 100% of the Group's strategic suppliers will be participating in our supplier sustainability

programme.”

L'Oréal considers that the activities of its suppliers are part of its
wider social and environmental footprint. This is why the Group.
has decided to associate its suppliers with its social, ethical
and environmental commitments. This concerns first and
foremost its “strategic” suppliers, who represent over 80% of the
Group's direct purchases (raw materials, packaging and
subcontracting).

Following on from the responsible purchasing policy it has
implemented since 2002 known as the L’Oréal Buy & Care

83% of the Group's strategic suppliers have been evaluated
and selected on the basis of their environmental and social
performance. They represent more than 74% of total direct purchases
(raw materials, packaging items and subcontracting). Furthermore, in
2016, 1,187 social audits were carried out, making a total of over 8,200
since 2006.

83% of strategic suppliers “ have completed a self-assessment
of their sustainability policy with the Group's support.

4% of strategic suppliers ? are associated

programme, the Sharing Beauty With All programme has
enabled the Group to associate its suppliers more with its CSR
initiatives by developing a twofold approach:

¢ the supplier selection process now takes into consideration
their environmental and social performances;

@ the Group makes available fo them continuous
improvement tools to enable them to carry out a better
self-assessment and improve.

2016
RESULTS

2020
TARGETS

© Strategic suppliers are suppliers whose added value is significant for the Group by contributing sustainably to L‘Oréal's strategy by their weight, their
innovations, their strategic alignment and their geographical deployment. 80% of the amount of direct purchases will ultimately be covered by this
approach. The portfolio of suppliers will therefore solely consist, in 2020, of suppliers with the best CSR results: new suppliers selected on their

performances and longstanding suppliers whom the Group continues 10 use as they are some of the best.

with the communities

“By 2020, the Group will enable more than 100,000 people from socially or financially deprived

communities to access work through its actions.”

Due to its large number of purchasing programmes and its
many industrial and administrative sites all over the world,
L’Oréal makes a contribution to many local projects. As a
general rule, the Group's establishments and its subsidiaries
build good relationships with the communities in the areas in
which they operate, and make every effort to share their
growth

This ambition led to a commitment in the Sharing Beauty With
All programme: enabling over 100,000 people from socially or

financially deprived communities to access work by 2020. This
means that L’Oréal will support as many people outside the
Company as there are employees in the Group.

To achieve this target, L’Oréal has implemented various
programmes: professional training for people in highly
vulnerable situations, the inclusion of persons with disabilities
or the deployment of Solidarity Sourcing projects.

Solidarity Sourcing

In 2010, L'Oréal created Solidarity Sourcing, a global
responsible purchasing programme which aims to open up
the Group’s calls for tenders to companies that employ people
from economically vulnerable communities in order to enable
them to have durable access to work and to income, as well
as to companies that traditionally do not have access to the
large calls for tenders of multinational companies.

Within this framework, the purchasers work in partnership with
the representatives of the Sharing Beauty With All programme
located in each country.

67,533 people from socially
or financially deprived communities
have had access to work.

Towards more sustainable consumption
behaviors

Finally, L'Oréal wants to offer its consumers the possibility to
make sustainable consumption choices. To this end, L'Oréal
mobilises all its brands, for all Divisions confined, around two
main levers of action:

« Assessment and improvement of their environmental and
social footprint: L'Oréal’s laboratories, alongside the
Development & Packaging teams and the RSE team, carry
out analyses of the portfolio of formulas and packaging of
each of the Group’s brands. Target: defining a sustainable
innovation plan, which identifies drivers for improvement
with regard to every one of its ranges and every one of its
products and sets out an action plan. In 2016, this work was
carried out with 89.6% of the Group's brands.

¢ Engagement alongside consumers: conscious of the ability
of its brands to mobilise their stakeholders - business
partners, customers, consumers, the general public -
around today’s major environmental and social causes, the
L'Oréal Group pledged that everyone would identify a
cause that they personally want to defend and undertake
campaigns to raise awareness. In 2016, 46.2% of the brands
conducted this type of action. Furthermore, since 2013,
U’Oréal conducts quantitative and qualitative studies to
gain a better understanding of what its consumers want
and to identify the most engaging manner to get them
involved in Sustainable Development issues in the
cosmetics sector. And, for the first time in 2016, the Group
held a consumer sustainability panel to share with them its
commitments and its results to date, and to get feedback
and receive suggestions for improvements.

providing innovative cosmetics that are affordable for all. It
has built its development around the deployment of its

Professional Makeup), supported by several specialist or
regional brands (Essie, Dark and Lovely, Niely Cosmeticos,
Nice & Lovely, Vogue, Magic, LaSCAD brands: Dop, Narta,

in their quest for healthy and beautiful skin. With the help of
a portfolio of highly complementary brands (Vichy, La

anchored in science and enjoying close links with
healthcare professionals all over the world, the Active
Cosmetics Division is a leader in dermocosmetics.

1.5.

The Group operates in a constantly changing environment
and like any company, L’Oréal is necessarily exposed to risks
which could have a negative impact for it if they were to
materialise.

In order to ensure the sustainability of its development and the
achievement of its objectives, the Group strives to anticipate
and manage the risks to which it is exposed in its different
areas of activity.

L'Oréal's risk management consists in identifying, managing
and controlling risks that may affect the smooth running of the
Company. It also participates in value creation by promoting
the good use of resources to minimise the impact of negative
events and maximise the realisation of opportunities

Risk management therefore goes beyond a strictly financial
framework.

By contributing to preventing and managing the risks to which
the Group is exposed, the purpose of the Internal Control
system is to enable the Group's industrial and economic
development to take place in a steady and sustainable
manner in a control environment appropriate for the Group’s
businesses

Presentation of the Group - Integrated report
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

In L’Oréal, Internal Control is a system that applies to the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“the Group”) and
aims at ensuring that:

¢@ economic and financial targets are achieved in
compliance with the laws and regulations in force;

@ the orientations set by General Management are followed;
@ the Group's assets are valued and protected;

¢ the Group’s financial and accounting information is reliable
and provides true and fair statements.

The control environment, which is critical to the Internal
Control system, good risk management and the application of
procedures, is based on people, behaviour and the
organisational structure. At L’Oréal, it forms part of a culture of
rigour and commitment communicated by — senior
management and is also in line with the Group’s strategic
choices.

Risk management and Internal Control are the affair of
everyone, from all the employees to the governance bodies.

The Internal Control system is the subject of ongoing
supervision in order to verify whether it is relevant and meets
the Group's objectives and addresses its issues.
