Group Principles

Business Model, Targets and Strategies

adesso is a rapidly growing IT service provider with the aim
of joining the ranks of the leading consulting and technol-
ogy groups for industry-specific business processes in Central
Europe. adesso applies its extensive expertise in the relevant
industries to act as an interface between the worlds of busi-
ness processes and IT and realise software projects that meet
the highest technical standards. Through the development of
in-house software solutions, adesso has increased its market
penetration and established an outstanding position when it
comes to future-oriented IT solutions such as mobilisation or
enterprise content management. One of adesso’s strategic tar-
gets is the internationalisation of the sale of its own products.
Business operations are also complemented by a defined acqui-
sition strategy.

Coupled with a focused business model and the mission to
outperform standard industry margins, the growth adesso has
achieved in the past has increased the value of the company on
a sustainable basis and the growth that is on the horizon will
continue to do so. adesso invests a great deal of resources in
targeted business development, the expansion of sales capac-
ity, recruiting and marketing. These investments, paired with
significant industry and consulting expertise, allow adesso to
generate growth that far exceeds the industry average. adesso
is a leading technology provider in the software development
industry and invests an above-average amount in training its
employees as well as in the ongoing development of the in-
house adesso software development model.

The Executive Board is committed to the strategy of striving
for the right balance of growth, solid finances and earning per-
formance.

For 2012, the Executive Board declared its targets of increasing
sales by 5 % to between EUR 110 million and EUR 112 mil-
lion and generating EBITDA of between EUR 7.2 million and
EUR7.5 million and earnings before taxes of EUR 5.0 million.

Employees and Structure

adesso was founded in 1997 and employed a total of 1,084
people in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the USA as of
the end of 2012. While 98 foreign employees are employed by
the adesso Group, 637 employees in Germany work for parent
company adesso AG, which, alongside its functions as a holding
company, therefore also represents the adesso’s largest operat-
ing unit. adesso’s largest location is Dortmund, which is also

36

the city in which adesso AG was founded and the location of the
company headquarters. In Germany, adesso maintains eight
further offices in all of the country’s key economic regions, both
to ensure constant customer proximity and to keep travel costs
as low as possible. adesso’s international locations are in Bos-
ton, London, Vienna and Zurich.

As of the reporting date, adesso Group consisted of adesso AG
as the largest operating unit and parent company, a number
of companies in which adesso holds a majority share, consol-
idated subsidiaries of subsidiaries and one joint venture. adesso
differentiates between two business areas: IT Services and IT
Solutions. In the IT Services business area, adesso offers tai-
lor-made, project-oriented services in the consulting and soft-
ware development industries and, in the IT Solutions business
area, markets its own solutions or standard software products.
The company is listed on all German stock exchanges (ISIN
code: DEOO0A0Z23Q5, WKN [national security identifica-
tion number]: AOZ23Q).

Management System

adesso AG spearheads adesso Group and defines the strategy
and operating targets of all companies contained within it. It
manages the legally independent companies in adesso Group
using a target-based system and a continuous reporting pro-
cess and by occupying positions on supervisory boards. As the
parent company, adesso AG provides services for the various
subsidiaries throughout the group in the areas of accounting,
human resources and marketing in the form of shared service
centres. A standardised, group-wide reporting system guaran-
tees operative management. Each company in adesso Group
prepares full monthly financial statements in accordance with
the respective national legal regulations. The key figures used
in reporting are sales, EBITDA, earnings before taxes (EBT),
EBT margin, number and proportion of employees not oper-
ating a full capacity, headcount and net cash position. For the
most important key figures, plan data is continuously com-
pared with actual data. All key figures are carried forward and
subject to an internal group benchmark. Every quarter, a rolling
full-year forecast is prepared for each company in adesso Group
in order to identify potential deviations from plan at an early
stage. Fixed reporting channels and cycles are defined and there
isalso a fixed schedule for management meetings. There are no
fundamental differences between key figures in each business
area’s reporting systems.

Research and Development

The lion’s share of adesso’s sales is attributed to IT Services.
Apart from a few exceptions, adesso solutions form the core of
project solutions which are then tailored to customer require-
ments in customer-specific projects. In comparison with group
expenses, research expenses in the IT Solutions business area
are negligible. No company in adesso Group possesses its own
dedicated research department. In 2012, development costs
for self-created intangible assets amounting to EUR 0.3 mil-
lion were recognised as assets on the income statement. In the
wake of the discontinuation of development of dynamic.suite
in May 2012, development costs recognised as assets amount-
ing to EUR 1.3 million were written offin full.

Economic Report

Macroeconomic Climate and Industry-
specific Conditions

Macroeconomic Climate

As anticipated by many economists, economic growth in Ger-
many also slowed down considerably in 2012. After GDP
growth of 3.0 % in the previous year, 2012 saw growth ofa
mere 0.7 %. According to the Federal Ministry of Economics
and Technology, the pivotal reasons for this have been weak
growth in the global economy and a loss of confidence in the
eurozone. In terms of growth generated over the course of the

year, Germany is still on better footing than most other econ-
omies in the eurozone, whose total economic output shrank
by 0.6 %. However, Germany also saw a slowdown in growth
from the start of the year into the third quarter, before gener-
ating negative growth of -0.6 % in the final quarter. According
to the Federal Government, this phase of weak development is
only temporary, although a further loss of momentum is fore-
cast for 2013 with growth falling to 0.4%.

Industry-specific Conditions

According to investigations carried out by industry associa-
tion BITKOM, the German IT products and services market
expanded by 2.7 % to EUR 73.4 billion in 2012. Growth has
fallen year on year, but the IT market lost less momentum than
the economy asa whole and grew almost four times as quickly.
The software segment saw the most positive development,
with market volume growth of 5.1 % to EUR 17.1 billion. The
most important business area for adesso’s sales, IT services, also
expanded considerably by 2.1 % to EUR 34.9 billion. Industry-
specific conditions therefore continued to be positive for ades-
so’s business performance.

Business Performance

There were no individual events that could be seen as hav-
ing affected the business performance in the reporting period.
However, in 2012 the sum of a number of factors led to prob-
lematic developments: lower capacity utilisation in the first half
of the year as a result ofa substantial increase in the headcount
in Germany, losses attributed to a major fixed-price project,
restructuring expenses in the energy industry as well as dis-
continuation of development on the dynamic.suite product

family. By contrast, the acquisition of a majority share in Arith-
nea GmbH at the start of the second quarter of 2012 madeasig-
nificant contribution to sales and operating result.

Overall Statement on Business Performance

by the Management

Both the operating performance of adesso AG and the earnings
performance of adesso Group failed to match figures from the
previous year. Internal group factors were chiefly responsible for
this. By contrast, adesso’s target market developed positively.
While adesso achieved its targets of operating growth above
the industry average, further internationalisation and develop-
ment of in-house solutions and products and its sales target, it
was unsuccessful in meeting its EBITDA and EBT targets and its
aim to generate an operating margin and profitability above the
industry average. In spite of an extremely good second half of
the year, adesso was unable to compensate for the sluggish first
six months of the year, meaning that EBITDA of EUR 6.7 mil-
lion fell short of the target of between EUR 7.2 million and EUR
7.5 million. Earnings before taxes were negatively impacted by
EUR 1.5 million asa result ofa discontinuation of development
on the dynamic.suite, meaning that total earnings before taxes
came to EUR 2.4 million and therefore fell short of the target of
EUR 5.0 million.

Growth in Sales

adesso increased its sales from EUR 106.0 million to EUR
120.5 million in financial year 2012, which amounted to sales
growth of 14 %. Of this growth, 5 % was organic and 10 % was
accounted for by changes in the basis of consolidation, in partic-
ular the majority takeover of Arithnea GmbH at the beginning
of the second quarter of 2012. With market growth of 2 % for
the industry, adesso once again had higher organic growth than
the market in 2012. Yet the rate of organic growth is low com-
pared to the previous years. Here, the decrease in sales by EUR
1.9 million in the restructured energy sector has to be taken into
account. The remaining business areas were able to expand their
activities organically by 6 %.

Sales revenues increased from quarter to quarter within the
year. While sales in the first quarter totalled EUR 27.4 million,
they reached a new high of EUR 32.7 million in the fourth quar-
ter. This was driven by increasing capacity utilisation, a signifi-
cant increase in the number of employees due to hiring in the
course of the year, higher licensing income from own products,
and the integration of Arithnea GmbH into the adesso Group
in the second quarter.

All of the growth was generated by the IT Services business
area. Sales in the IT Services business area increased by 18 % to
EUR 112.6 million (non-IFRS) while the IT Solutions busi-
ness area remained unchanged at EUR 23.7 million. IT Services
therefore accounted for 83 %, an increase over the previous year
(80 %). The three adesso subsidiaries in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland boosted sales revenues by between 17 %and 30%
in the IT Services business area. Sales in the “Expert Resourc-
ing” area also grew substantially at 16 %. Asa specialist for the
deployment of e-commerce and content management systems,
Arithnea GmbH is assigned to the IT Services business area,
contributing to its further growth.

In the IT Solutions business area, Content Solutions was able
to maintain licensing and maintenance sales for the in-house
high-end content management system FirstSpirit at the high
level of the previous year. Mobile Solutions once again boosted
its sales by over 30 %. One of the fastest growing areas in IT is
mobilising web content and business processes. Here, adesso
is a leading provider in Germany with its own in|MOTION
technology along with proven expertise in the development
of mobile applications. The implementation business with the
existing PSLife system for life insurance companies dropped off
for project-related reasons.

Higher sales were generated in all established core industries
including insurance, banking, lottery and healthcare. In the new

target sector of public administration, sales remained constant
while decreasing by 24 % in the energy industry. The “Other”

business area outside of the core industries grew particularly
fast. The Content Solutions and Mobile Solutions business
areas as well as the growing business with the Microsoft tech-
nologies SharePoint and Dynamics CRM are able to position
the products and services in numerous sectors even without
detailed industry knowledge. Business Intelligence, which
was newly initiated in 2012, serves a similarly broad range of
customers. This means that market penetration in the estab-
lished core industries for adesso can be increased while also
serving additional sectors. This effect was further intensified
since Arithnea GmbH, with its focus on e-commerce, counts
numerous manufacturers and commercial enterprises among
its customers.

The export business grew as the adesso subsidiary in Switzer-
land once again developed favourably and business in Aus-
tria increased as well. Product sales to other countries did
not increase in 2012. The proportion of export sales remains
unchanged at 19 %.

Earnings

Atsales growth of 14 %, the average number of employees (FTE)
grew disproportionately by 28 % or by 223 employees to 1,007 in
2012. With a lower material usage ratio of 11 % (previous year:
12%), gross profit per employee decreased significantly by 10 % to
EUR 106 thousand (previous year: EUR 118 thousand). Since the
employees exceed the importance of all other driving forces by
far, both in terms of service provisioning and asa portion of costs,
the decrease in gross profit per employee is key to the negative

development of the operating margin in 2012. A number of fac-
tors are responsible for this development. In the adesso subsidiary
in Germany, which increased its number of employees organi-
cally by 25 % to 701, the average capacity utilisation of the con-
sultants and software developers fell - especially during the first
six months ~ and a lower average daily rate was realised. A fixed
price project fora long-standing customer resulted in significant
losses which had to be compensated as well. The lower capacity
utilisation is in part due to the usual lead times for new hires. New
areas such as Business Intelligence and Telecommunication were
also developed in 2012, with average capacity utilisation that
was lower during the ongoing initiation phase compared to the
established business. This was compounded by the restructuring
phase of the energy sector, which led to high expenditures in the
development of own products and in the consulting business.

At EUR 2.9 million, other operating income increased by EUR
1.2 million on the previous year. This includes the release of a
financial liability at EUR 878 thousand for the elimination of a
conditional purchase price increase, which is related to exercising
an option under a purchase contract for shares in evu.it GmbH.
The purchase price for the 20 % of shares in evu.it GmbH under
the option decreased to EUR 0 as a result of losses in the energy
sector.

The 4 % increase in cost of materials at EUR 13.8 million (previ-
ous year: EUR 13.3 million), mainly for the project integration
of subcontractors, was significantly lower than the rise in sales,
which grew by 14 %. A higher proportion of sales was therefore

generated with own employees, which is a normal development
in view of low capacity utilisation. Gross profit grew faster than
sales by 15 % to EUR 106.8 million (previous year: EUR 92.7
million) as a result. Personnel costs, on the other hand, grew dis-
proportionately by 18 % to EUR 77.4 million. Average expenses
per employee decreased by 9 % to EUR 77 thousand, in particu-
lar due to lower variable compensation and changes to the basis
of consolidation; this prevented an even more severe drop in the
operating margin.

Other operating expenses increased by 22 % to EUR 25.8 mil-
lion (previous year: EUR 21.2 million). Most of the increase in
other operating income is due to the higher number of employ-
ees. Additional office space was leased and high fees for person-
nel consulting were once again paid. Cost items such as travel
expenses, vehicle and training costs totalling EUR 1.0 million
in 2012 alone (previous year: EUR 0.5 million) tend to increase
proportionally with each employee. Other operating expenses
for 2012 included a subsequent purchase price tranche (earn out)
of EUR 885 thousand due to the final purchase price allocation
from the acquisition of Arithnea GmbH, recorded through profit
or loss. Without this item other operating expenses would have
increased by 17 %.

Total operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) decreased by 22 % or EUR 1.9 million to
EUR 6.7 million (previous year: EUR 8.6 million). The operat-
ing EBITDA margin is 5.6 % compared to 8.1 %. This means the
targets for 2012 were not met.

Income was increased significantly in the course of the year. After
aweak first half of the year in 2012 with EBITDA of EUR 1.4 mil-
lion, the value increased to EUR 5.3 million in the last six months
and therefore to a new half-year high for the adesso Group. The
clear improvement in results is due to the suspension of devel-
opment activities and the restructuring measures in the energy
sector, which are starting to take effect, significantly improved
capacity utilisation in Germany, the conclusion of a fixed price
project with severe losses, and higher license sales. Arithnea
GmbH being part the adesso Group for the entire year also had
an effect. The EBITDA margin was 2.4 % in the first half of the
year and 8.3 % in the second.

EBITDA (non-IFRS) decreased noticeably over the previous
year by EUR 0.8 million or 31 % to EUR 1.8 million in the IT
Solutions business area only, while the IT Services business area
generated an unchanged EUR 6.3 million. The poor earnings sit-
uation of the energy sector business within the IT Services busi-
ness area was offset by the highly profitable Arithnea GmbH. As
expected, Content Management Systems in the IT Solutions busi-
ness area fell slightly below the record values of the previous year.
The EBITDA fell to 5.6 % (previous year: 6.6 %) for IT Services
and 7.6 % (previous year: 11.1 %) for IT Solutions.

Depreciation and amortisation increased by EUR 0.7 million to
EUR 4.2 million in the reporting period. Planned amortisation
on intangible assets such as customer lists and order backlog from
mergers increased to EUR 1.4 million (previous year: EUR 1.0
million) due to the acquisition of Arithnea GmbH. Depreciation

on capital assets increased by EUR 0.4 million to EUR 1.2 million.
Unplanned amortisation on intangible assets was also recognised
in the amount of EUR 1.3 million related to the deconsolidation
of dynamicutilities GmbH iL.

The financial result came to EUR -139 thousand compared to
EUR -150 thousand in the previous year. Earnings before taxes
(EBT) decreased by 52 % to EUR 2.4 million (previous year: EUR
5.0 million) due to lower operating earnings as well as higher
depreciation and amortisation. Income tax expense was EUR 2.5
million (previous year: EUR 1.1 million). Tax expenses increased
in particular because the usable deferred taxes on loss carry-for-
wards for adesso AG were valued at EUR 1.1 million less, leading
toa deferred tax expense in this amount. This resulted in neg-
ative consolidated earnings of EUR -0.1 million in 2012 com-
pared to EUR 3.9 million in the previous year. Earnings per share
amounted to EUR 0.12 compared to EUR 0.72.

The Supervisory Board and Executive Board of adesso AG shall
propose an unchanged dividend of EUR 0.18 per share to the

Annual General Meeting. Based on the year-end closing price of
the adesso share, the dividend yield is 3 % (previous year: 3 %).

Orders

The order volume continued to increase in parallel to sales
growth. Demand remained consistently dynamic in the course
of the year. With the exception of the energy sector, a slump in
demand was not observed in any region, segment or industry.
The order backlog on the reporting date is comparable to previ-
ous years. Business activities continue at the start of 2013 with
the vast majority of the leading customers for 2012. Thanks to
a Europe-wide tender won by adesso in numerous partial lots,
cooperation for the next two years was assured with a leading
customer of the adesso Group in terms of sales.

Financial Position

Financial Management Principles and Objectives

adesso pursues a balanced financial policy. The objective of
financial managementis to assure short-term liquidity, includ-
inga margin of safety, as well as securing and acquiring financial
assets to fund medium- and long-term investment projects. In
principle, the company does not enter into transactions with
speculative elements. There are no variable interest rates on
investments. The maximum investment term is nine months,
with one to three months being the most common in order to
remain flexible in response to investment opportunities that
arise. Central cash management at the level of daily account
clearing has not been set up. Bank borrowing is centralised with
the parent company. The account balances and financial posi-
tion of all companies are transparent to the group’s Executive

adesso AG Annual Report 2012

Board, and constitute a standard element of the monthly
reporting system. Off balance sheet financing, such as leasing,
is utilised to a minor extent only. Company vehicles as well as
office furnishings and equipmentare leased. Factoring or other
methods of selling receivables are not used.

Capital Structure

Financing is needed primarily for the receivables portfolio and
services that have not been settled in the amount of EUR 29.3
million (previous year: EUR 22.7 million). Working capital
is EUR 22.0 million as of 31 December 2012 (previous year:
EUR 14.5 million). Advance financing of business operations
has therefore increased by 52 %, tying up liquidity. A loan of
EUR 5.0 million was taken out in the course of an acquisition
in 2012. Like all current bank loans, it has a total term of five
years and is paid back in instalments. The favourable balance
sheet structure of adesso and the lower overall interest level
resulted in a competitive interest rate of 2.3 %. No special guar-
antees were granted for the loan. The portfolio of interest-bear-
ing financial liabilities increased from EUR 4.9 million in the
previous year to EUR 7.7 million on the reporting date. Since a
loan with an interest rate of 5.7 % was fully redeemed and anew
loan taken out at 2.3 %, the average interest rate on this portfo-
lio has fallen. The remaining terms of the loans on the report-
ing date range from 14 months to four years and three months.
Interest is fixed over the entire term. A fixed interest rate was
secured for a variable interest-bearing loan by means of an inter-
est rate swap. All interest-bearing liabilities are denominated in
euros. Credit balances are largely available in the short term and
bear interest at fixed rates. Net liquidity (liquidity less liabili-
ties) is EUR 13.7 million (previous year: EUR 17.6 million).

Investments, Acquisitions and Divestments

The adesso business model requires relatively low investments
in capital assets. The capital assets of EUR 2.0 million (previous
year: EUR 1.4 million) largely consist of hardware such as lap-
tops and servers as well as office furnishings. There are no sig-
nificant subsequent obligations from capital asset investment
projects as of 31 December 2012, and no investment backlog to
report. Two significant investments were realised in the report-
ing period.

The acquisition of 51 % of the shares in Arithnea GmbH, Neu-
biberg near Munich, led to a purchase price payment of EUR 4.1
million in the reporting period. Thanks to the highly success-
ful business development of Arithnea GmbH in its deviating
2011/12 financial year, which is used for the measurement of
a conditional purchase price payment (earn out), an additional
payment of EUR 1.1 million will be payable in 2013. The group
received the liquid assets of Arithnea in the amount of EUR
2.6 million at the time of the acquisition. The development of

dynamic.suite until May of 2012 led to negative contributions
to earnings in the amount of EUR -0.7 million and correspond-
ing outflows of liquidity until further development of the pro-
ject was cancelled. Further details regarding the balance sheet
impact are provided in the consolidated notes.

adesso hosting services GmbH was founded as another subsidi-
ary of adesso AG at the end of 2012. adesso AG holds 51 % of
this company; the remaining shares are held by Adacor Host-
ing GmbH, Essen, co-founder of the company. The founding
and payment of the full capital stock of EUR 0.1 million was
realised in December of 2012, with entry in the commercial
register in January 2013. Business operations commenced in
January 2013. With the new company’s portfolio ofindividual
and complex hosting and cloud services solutions, adesso will
be ina position to optimally serve the entire software develop-
ment value chain in the future. This opens up additional busi-
ness models for adesso, for example running applications on
behalf of customers. adesso hosting services GmbH is based
in Dortmund.

Liquidity

Cash and cash equivalents total EUR 21.4 million on the report-
ing date (previous year: EUR 22.5 million). They are partly off-
set by interest-bearing liabilities, mainly from several acquisition
loans, in the amount of EUR 7.7 million (previous year: EUR 4.9
million). Net liquidity (liquidity less interest-bearing liabilities) is
EUR 13.7 million (previous year: EUR 17.7 million).

Cash flow from operating activities dropped noticeably to EUR

1.0 million (previous year: EUR 10.2 million). This decrease
is largely due to lower earnings with higher tax payments, and

especially the working capital increase of EUR 7.5 million. The
change to net operating assets tied up an additional EUR 3.7
million after EUR 1.5 million was released here in the previ-
ous year. Cash flow from investment activities was EUR -3.3
million (previous year: EUR -1.9 million). Investments of EUR
1.5 million (previous year: EUR 1.0 million) in capital assets for
the acquisition of new hardware and software as well as office
furnishings and equipment increased due to growth. A reduced
amount of EUR 0.4 million (previous year: EUR 1.0 million)
was paid out for investments in intangible assets, especially in
the form of developing own capitalised software products since
the development of dynamic.suite was cancelled. The net cash
effect from the acquisition of Arithnea GmbH led to an outflow
from investment activities of EUR 1.5 million. Cash flow from
financing activities was EUR 1.2 million (previous year: EUR
-2.9 million). The positive financing contribution was largely
the result of taking out a new loan of EUR 5.0 million, regu-
lar redemption payments on financial liabilities in the amount
of EUR 2.9 million (previous year: EUR 2.0 million) and the
dividend payment of EUR 1.1 million (previous year: EUR 0.9
million).

The availment of approved lines of credit with several banks
totalled EUR 1.7 million, which is EUR 0.8 million more
than in the previous year. The additional credit line applies to
Arithnea GmbH. There was no availment of credit lines on the
reporting date.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by EUR 1.1 million over-
all, compared to an increase of EUR 5.5 million in the previ-
ous year.

Consolidated Financial Statement
Consolidated Notes
Management and Directors
Service

Cash and cash equivalents include larger amounts, typical for
the business, which will be paid out in the first few months
of 2013. Variable compensation payable in the first quarter of
2012 is the biggest item. Overall, the liquidity of the adesso
Group is adequate to carry on current business operations for
the planned redemption of liabilities and to compensate for
ordinary fluctuations in capacity utilisation.

Net Assets

Analysis of the Asset Structure

Total assets on the reporting date increased by 10 % or EUR
6.8 million to EUR 76.6 million (previous year: EUR 69.8 mil-
lion). On the assets side, trade receivables and the value of work
in progress accounted for the bulk of the increase at a total of
EUR 6.6 million. The increase in non-current assets was far
less at EUR 23.9 million compared to EUR 23.2 million in the
previous year. Planned amortisation on intangible assets from
purchase price allocations as well as the revaluation of deferred
taxes for the utilisation potential of loss carry-forwards have
had an impact here. On the liabilities side, currentand non-cur-
rent liabilities increased mainly due to anew loan while equity
remained virtually unchanged at EUR 34.1 million (previous
year: EUR 34.4 million). The equity ratio therefore fell to 44.6
% compared to 49.2 % in the previous year.

Financial and Non-financial Performance Indicators
The key financial performance indicators used for internal con-
trol of the group are sales growth, EBITDA and the EBITDA
margin. Targets and actual values for the reporting period as
well as the medium- and long-term target corridor are provided
in the table.

Pre-tax earnings are not a general financial performance indi-
cator of adesso for the internal control of the group. The fore-
cast for 2012 was included in the presentation for better com-
prehension. adesso does not use any non-financial performance
indicators for the internal control of the group.

Subsequent Events

No further events of material importance to adesso AG occurred
after the reporting date on 31 December 2012. On 3 January
2013, rku.it GmbH exercised its put option relating to 20 % of
the shares in evu.it GmbH This means that adesso is obliged to
purchase a further 20 % of evu.it GmbH and therefore increase
its stake to 80 %. The purchase price is set to amount to EUR 0.

Forecast, Opportunities
and Risk Reports

Forecast Report

Group Orientation over

the Next Two Financial Years

adesso’s vision of becoming one of Central Europe’s leading IT
consulting firms for industry-specific business processes will
be pursued with vigour. The strategic guidelines for growth
through industry segmentation, portfolio expansion in IT Ser-
vices, internationalisation and the expansion of the company’s
solution portfolio in the IT Solutions business area will con-
tinue to determine what action adesso takes over the next two
years. In comparison to 2012, adesso is aiming to strike a better
balance between growth and profitability. The same acquisition
policy will be pursued. Irrespective of the acquisition policy,
organic growth will continue to be spurred on in all industries
and regions. The sales generated abroad are to be increased in
particular through further internationalisation of FirstSpirit
product sales and further growth at subsidiaries in Austria and
Switzerland. In terms of the adesso subsidiary currently being
established in Turkey, sales are only expected to be generated
from 2014 onwards.

Future Macroeconomic Situation

With annual GDP growth of 0.7 %, the German economy lost
a substantial amount of momentum over the course of 2012
and even slipped into negative growth in the fourth quarter.
According to the Federal Government, a notable slowdown in
the global economy coupled with growing uncertainty among
market participants as a result of high levels of debt held by
industrialised nations are the factors responsible for this weak
development, something that also negatively impacted invest-
ment propensity in the German economy. However, the stabi-
lisation in the international environment both on the financial
markets as well as in terms of the real economy has strength-
ened confidence among businesses and consumers alike. On

the basis of the gradual improvements in economic indicators,
the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology is only fore-
casting a short period of weak development that will be over-
come over the course of 2013. In 2013, gross domestic product
is set to grow further, however, due to the weak winter period,
the increase will remain moderate at around 0.4 %. With the
increasing recovery experienced throughout the global econ-
omy, the competitive German economy should gain more
momentum over the course of the year. A return to stronger
growth of 1.6 % is expected in 2014.

Based on information provided by an expert group commis-
sioned by the government, the Swiss State Secretariat for Eco-
nomic Affairs SECO is expecting moderate GDP growth in
Switzerland of 1.3 % in 2013, which should be consolidated
at 2.0 % in 2014. On the basis of forecasts published by the
Austrian Institute of Economic Research and the Institute for

Advanced Studies, the Austrian Economic Chambers (WKO) is
anticipating growth in Austrian GDP of 1.0 % and 0.8 % respec-
tively in 2013 and 1.8% in 2014.

Asa result, 2013 will once again offer a sluggish macroeco-
nomic climate for adesso which, in view of current develop-
ment, poses significant risks. However, due to central banks’
monetary policy which has been supportive thus far, it is not
yet expected that the positive trend in terms of further eco-
nomic growth in adesso-relevant sectors will take a turn for
the worse in 2013 and 2014.

Future Industry Situation

According to industry association BITKOM, the IT market in
Germany continues to progress far more positively than the
economy asa whole. With market volume of EUR 73.4 billion
in 2012, the 2 % growth rate expected in 2013 is significantly

above that of GDP asa whole. Within the IT sector, BITKOM
anticipates that the software segment will experienced signif-
icantly stronger growth of 4.6 % than the adesso-relevant IT
services segment, which is only set to grow by 2.5 %. Accord-
ing to forecasts, the services and software segments of the IT
market relevant for adesso are highly likely to develop posi-
tively in 2013. Internally, adesso is anticipating growth of 3 %
in 2013 in relevant markets in the DACH region. Similar figures
are expected for 2014.

Anticipated Sales and Earnings Situation

The report on risks and opportunities is a pivotal part of the
management’s considerations of the further development of
adesso and of the forecast report. Potential acquisitions are not
included in the forecast calculations.

Based on anticipated economic growth of 3 % in relevant seg-
ments of the IT market as well as on internal calculations, the
adesso management is expecting the following in 2013:

> An increase in sales revenues of between 7 % and 9 % to
between EUR 129 million and EUR 131 million (2012: EUR
121 million).

» The operating EBITDA margin is to rise to between 5.8 %
and 6.1 % (2012: 5.6 %).

> The operating result, EBITDA, is expected to amount to
between EUR 7.5 million and EUR 8.0 million (2012: 6.7
million) and therefore increase by between 12 % and 19 %.

This growth, which is significantly above the industry aver-
age, is expected to predominantly originate from the IT Ser-
vices business area. This includes a contribution of up to 3 %
through the full-year inclusion of Arithnea GmbH (previous
year: three quarters). The expansion of the headcount by 25 %
in the adesso subsidiary in Germany in 2012 also led to rising
sales expectations.

The increase in the operating margin is based on expectations
that the restructuring of the energy industry successfully takes
effect and margins at subsidiaries in Germany and Austria can
be increased. Stronger growth in terms of the EBITDA margin
toward the target of between 9 % and 11 %is to be hindered by
scheduled start-up losses from the entry into the US market and
further internationalisation in the IT Solutions business area. In
addition, the establishment of the subsidiary in Turkey and the
marked declines in sales as a result of an unusually high num-
ber of employees on sick leave caused bya flu epidemic in Janu-
ary and February 2013 will also negatively impact the margin.

For 2014, we are anticipating further sales growth as well as
further positive development of the operating result.

48

Expected Financial Position

adesso’s liquid asset base is solid and will be sufficient to cover
financial obligations in 2013 should the forecast business
development come to fruition. adesso’s balance sheet structure
allows it to assume additional liabilities for investment pro-
jects to ensure that there are no shortfalls in terms of financing.
adesso continues to strive fora positive net cash position. Only
in the event of the potential acquisition of an unusually large
company of extremely high strategic value for adesso would
there be any deviation from this strategy.

On this basis, the Executive Board is to continue pursuing the
current dividend policy. If the profit targets can be achieved to
a large extent, the Executive Board will strive to increase the
dividend. The dividend proposed for 2013 will reflect actual
developments.

Opportunities and Risk Report

Risk management is a pivotal component of all decisions and
business processes. In a wider context, adesso understands risks
as the danger of notachieving financial and operating targets as
planned and, in the strictest sense, as factors endangering the
existence of the company. In order to safeguard the success of
the company over the long term, it is therefore essential that
adesso identifies and analyses risks efficiently and combats or
mitigates them by implementing sufficient control measures.
adesso’s active risk management therefore also opens up oppor-
tunities for the company.

Risk Management System

adesso possesses a system of processes and data analysis struc-
tures to monitor risks posed to the company. An exclusive risk
management software system is not used. Instead, adesso uses
an integrated system developed by Corporate Planning AG for
financial and operational planning as well as operational con-
trolling. All plan and actual data from all business areas is stored
ina central database for the purposes of reporting. Current fig-
ures are inputted directly from financial accounting. In addi-
tion, key figures such as sales per employee, available liquidity,
resources notat full capacity, order intake and order backlog are
also recorded. All companies included in the scope of consoli-
dation are part of the reporting system.

Fixed reporting channels have been established for other risks,
such as those arising from the absence of contracts, high levels
of receivables from customers or projects that are threatening
to go over budget. Certain reporting thresholds apply, which,
if breached, result in the issue being included on the agenda of


--- Page 14 ---

Executive Board meetings. Similar risks posed to companies in
adesso Group are identified through close cooperation with the
respective responsible Executive Board member of adesso AG.
adesso does not have a central risk manager. Risk reporting and
assessment is documented ina risk manual. The risk manual is
submitted to the Supervisory Board so that the risk manage-
ment system can be acknowledged and reviewed.

Recognising opportunities and new areas of business are just
as important for the development of adesso. Working groups
consisting of the Executive Board, Business Development,
the management of companies in adesso Group and heads of
business areas, meet on a regular basis to analyse new business
opportunities and develop new business models, industries,
solutions or regions. The progress made in implementing these
measures is presented at regular intervals.

Within the scope of a risk inventory, the following risks were
assessed as relevant to our business and subsequently assessed
in view of their probability of occurrence and amount of loss.
In principal, only risks that would have negative implications
for the asset, financial or profit situation if they were to come
to fruition are listed here.

Moreover, adesso is potentially exposed to further risks which
may not be known or be considered as major risks at the current
time. The risk factor is calculated as a product of probability of
occurrence and the amount of loss and forms the basis for the
relevance of the risk. The following risks were identified as of
the reporting date and as of the preparation of the management
reportas havinga risk factor worthy of inclusion in this report:

Primary Risk Carrier

Risks from a Shortfall in Planned Sales

In the event of a high gross margin and a large share of fixed
costs, low sales can be directly reflected in adesso’s result.
In 2012, the two halves of the year were very different. For
example, almost the entire operating profit was generated
in the second half of the year and the full-year target was not
reached. General expectations in terms of economic develop-
ment in 2013 are cautiously optimistic. At the moment, it is
more difficult to assess demand than it has been in previous
planning periods. In the IT Services business area, capacity
utilisation is expected to increase on average in 2013. How-
ever, a decline in order intake or the termination of important
ongoing customer orders could result in idle periods with
corresponding implications for the profit and financial situa-
tion within a short period of time. Given that the IT Services
business area in particular generates business over specific
periods of time, such idle periods are difficult to compensate
for. This risk factor will increase in significance in comparison

adesso AG Annual Report 2012

with the previous year due to the more positive forecast in
terms of capacity utilisation, even though general economic
risks are anticipated to fall as a result of further stabilisation
of the financial crisis in the eurozone. Given that this risk fac-
tor is highly relevant to the company, adesso monitors the fol-
lowing values on a monthly, and sometimes biweekly basis in
order to identify trends at an early stage and take correspond-
ing action: order backlog, order intake, number of hours
invoiced and capacity utilisation rates, number of employees
not working at full capacity.

The IT Solutions business area pursues a product strategy. In
this business area, even standard solutions developed by adesso
are sold and implemented through licensing with maintenance
contracts. While maintenance contracts represent a relatively
stable basis for sales, the achievement of targets and the result of
product companies are reliant on order intake and much more
volatile than the service business given the low number ofnew
licences sold. Sales revenues from maintenance activities do
not cover total ongoing costs at any of the companies in adesso
Group. Asa result, the product companies’ licence sales and
related sales pipelines are monitored in detail in terms of struc-
ture and development over time. The plan deviation risk fac-
tor is also set to increase in 2013 in the IT Solutions business
area, as a substantial volume of investment will go toward fur-
ther internationalisation in regions such as the USA, Scandi-
navia, the UK and Switzerland. Based on internationalisation
planning, seven-figure licence sales are already anticipated from
new international customers. However, planned sales in new
regions are hampered by increased uncertainty.

In each business area, there are detailed plans in which actual
figures and previous year’s figures are compared on a monthly
basis. A revised forecast continues to be produced every quarter
detailing anticipated plan deviations at an early stage. The cor-
responding reports form the foundations for monthly meetings
on business development and business prospects. This applies
to all companies of adesso Group.

Project Risks

In the event of the budgeted time frame and costs being
exceeded, fixed-price projects can lead to project-related
losses. Budget deviations are identified and analysed con-
stantly during every fixed-price project. There is also an esca-
lation mechanism that extends to the Executive Board. As of
the reporting date, there were several cases in which custom-
ers refused to accept delivery. Two customers claimed back
payments that had been made totalling over EUR 0.5 mil-
lion. Several projects presented for customer approval have
not yet been formally accepted by the customer. However, as
there has been no case of refusal to accept delivery, this delay

2012 Highlights

Consolidated Notes

Service

is not unusual for standard business operations. The backlog
of fixed-price projects that have yet to be invoiced in full rose
year on year. Project risks are anticipated to have increased,
as there have been several cases of refusal to accept delivery
and claims for repayment and one extensive, high-loss fixed-
price project in Germany, which led to substantial negative
effects in 2012.

At adesso, an Excel-based project controlling and reporting
system is used. Depending on the project structure, sub-pro-
jects are defined and mapped on adesso’s web-based pro-
ject and schedule management system. Expenses are dis-
tributed across the sub-projects and milestones are defined.
Over the course of the project, the actual time and expenses
are compared with plan figures, the remaining expenses are
calculated and compliance with the defined schedule is doc-
umented. Additional monthly assessments of work that is
still to be completed are used to calculate the level of comple-
tion. By comparing the level of completion and the remain-
ing expenses, any potential budget deviations can be iden-
tified at an early stage. Projects that are given “overspend”
status where it is likely that the budget will be exceeded are
then added to the agenda of subsequent Executive Board
meetings. Aside from acknowledging the risk, the Executive
Board meeting also discusses potential strategies to improve
the situation by analysing the reasons for the overspend-
ing. However, the share of projects with fixed budgets in
the form of service contracts in terms of overall adesso sales
is low at under 20 %. In spite of this, the negative effects of
budget overspends in fixed-price projects over the past few
years have risen. In order to counteract this trend, adesso AG
has established a Project Management Office (PMO) where
experts supervise particularly large-scale or challenging pro-
jects using standardised tools and mechanisms alongside the
regular project management team. Project risks exist in both
business areas to the same extent.

Personnel Risks

adesso is an IT company without any notable fixed assets. The
company’s most important assets are its employees. Asa result,
adesso constantly monitors and assesses a number of key per-
formance indicators such as headcount, number of unproduc-
tive employees, number of employees on sick leave, employee,
costs/sales per employee and capacity utilisation. The top-level
management is always informed about every dismissal and new
recruit. The Executive Board regularly analyses trends and dis-
cussed measures in its meetings. This allows any potential loss
of knowledge and expertise to be identified promptly. In the
product segments, essential knowledge is concentrated around
asmall group of key developers. These developers are a particu-
lar focus of human resources activities.

50

The search for suitable, experienced employees remains char-
acterised by an ever-increasing demand surplus from the com-
panies. By contrast, the resulting entry-level salary expecta-
tions expressed by new recruits as well as existing employees’
expectations regarding pay rises are not always able to be com-
pensated through a corresponding adjustment of market prices,
meaning that the operating margin can be negatively impacted
as a result. adesso reinforces its position as a premium IT ser-
vice provider through extraordinarily talented employees
with a vast amount of experience in their fields. Competitors
in this area continue to increase their headcounts ~ not simply
IT service providers, but also between user companies and the
IT industry, A small number of employees are responsible for
adesso’s outstanding position in its core industries. The simul-
taneous departure of more than one of these employees would
expose the company to medium-term risks in terms of its fur-
ther development. Such risks are combatted through active
recruiting, strategies to intensify employee loyalty and excel-
lent career prospects in a prospering company.

Employee turnover remained at a stable level that is average
for the industry in 2012. The risk of the lack of availability of
experienced employees as well as risks from high employee
turnover and salaries increasing disproportionately to market
prices were assessed as being constant. Asa result, personnel
risk remains one of the group’s main risks.

Risks from the Development of New Products and
Solutions

In 2011 and 2012, adesso Group significantly increased its
investment in the development of new products and solu-
tions and therefore shifted the risk profile of its service-ori-
ented business model more towards its product business. The
volume of investment was substantial in relation to the consoli-
dated income statement and, asa result, was included as one of
the main risks in 2011. This risk mainly affects the IT Solutions
business area. Development of the dynamic.suite, the compa-
ny’s single most important development, was stopped in the
middle of 2012; investment made thus far has been written off.
While this signifies the relevance of this risk, it has declined
year on year asa result of the substantial decline in development
work, which is now confined to several small-scale projects.

Other Relevant Risks

Risks from Business Activities in other Legal Sys-
tems

adesso Group continues to expand internationally and enter
new legal systems. This strategy presents potential risks in both
business areas from lack of knowledge of legal affairs and prac-
tical business operations. However, as of the reporting date,
the IT Solutions business area was more exposed to these risks


--- Page 16 ---

than the IT Services business area, after e-Spirit AG established
anew company in the USA knownas e-Spirit Inc. based in Del-
aware with offices in Boston. In the USA, the risk of product
manufacturers taking legal action is greater than it is in Ger-
many. The German management team lacks experience in deal-
ing with American customers. e-Spirit Inc. has an insurance
policy with the maximum amount of liability that it could be
granted. In terms of both the legal structure of the company
as well as internal cost allocation, it has been ensured that the
potential for any problems to spread across to e-Spirit AG is as
low as possible. In the IT Services business area, adesso is set to
launch a subsidiary in Turkey. Itis to be ensured thata manage-
ment team is in place that has experience of the local market,
however, the company will also be exposed to lack of knowl-
edge of Turkish law. In view of the marginal scope of business
compared with the rest of the group, this risk is still classified
under other relevant risks at the current time.

Risks from the Customer Structure

As sales from individual customers or customer groups
increase, so does the risk posed by such customer relationships
from potential project terminations or normal project expiry.
In 2012, the largest customer accounted for 8 % (previous year:
8 %) of total sales. A total of 33 % of overall sales were gen-
erated from adesso’s 10 largest customers (previous year: 37
%). Risks from the customer structure have been falling as a
result of adesso’s growth. The assessment of this risk remains
the same as the previous year and is still classified under the
group’s other relevant risks. However, the abrupt loss of one
of the group’s 10 largest customers would have the potential
to negatively impact the earnings and financial situation of the
company substantially, at least in the short term. The relation-
ship to each of these top customers is managed by a member
of the Executive Board or by the management of the respective
subsidiary in order to recognise potential risks promptly and
take appropriate action.

Each quarter, the top 10 customers are listed by sales and each
customer’s share of overall sales is calculated. This avoids a con-
centration on a small number of customer relationships and
therefore allows a cluster risk to be recognised promptly.

Risks from Regulatory Law

Asa listed company on the regulated market, adesso AG is sub-
ject to a number of additional legal requirements and obliga-
tions, such as the Aktiengesetz (AktG — German Stock Corpo-
ration Act), the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG- German
Securities Trading Act) and the Wertpapieriibernahmege-
setz (WpUG - German Securities Acquisition and Takeover
Act). adesso follows corresponding developments in case law,
obtains assessments from experience solicitors and familiarises

its entire workforce with the fulfilment of the legal obligations
of a listed company. As a consequence, adesso has established
a Compliance Officer, set up an insider directory and contin-
uously reviews incidents that could lead to insider trading or
result in an imbalance of information on the capital market.

In September 2012, the Federal Financial Supervisory Author-
ity (BaFin - Bundesanstalt fiir Finanzdienstleistungsaufsi-
cht) began a review into the suspicion of the late publication
of insider information contrary to Article 15 (1) Sentence 1
WpHG and filed charges on three counts relating to commu-
nication in 2011. According to the Ordnungswidrigkeitenge-
setz (OWiG - German Act on Regulatory Offences), the maxi-
mum penalty for such breaches of the law is a fine of up to EUR
1 million, depending on their severity. adesso has issued a full
statement on the allegations and contradicted BaFin’s version
of events through its legal representative. In this regard, adesso
AG is unaware of any further procedures on the part of BaFin.

Financial Risks

The risks posed by the financial situation and liquidity have
increased. In spite of ongoing repayments in 2012 amounting
to EUR 3.0 million, interest-bearing liabilities have increased
as a result of the assumption of a further acquisition loan of
EUR 5.0 million. These repayments must be made, even in the
absence of business success. However, liquid assets far exceed
loan liabilities meaning that the complete repayment of loans
using cash reserves remains a possibility.

Currency risks remain low for adesso. Only a small proportion
of sales are conducted in a currency other than the euro. These
transactions mainly concern adesso Schweiz AG and e-Spirit
Schweiz AG, which conduct business in Swiss francs, e-Spirit
UK Ltd., which conducts business in British pounds and e-Sprit
Inc., which operates in the US dollar currency area. These com-
panies process the majority of their business in the respective
national currency. No currency hedging transactions were car-
ried out.

adesso AG’s loss carryforwards for trade tax and corporation
tax purposes as of 31 December 2006 continued to be utilised
in relation to BOV AG in consideration of minimum taxation
following the fusion of adesso AG (old). However, the possibil-
ity cannot be ruled out that financial administration at adesso
AG will not recognise the restructuring of business operations
of BOV AG in accordance with Section 8 (4) Kérperschaftss-
teuergesetz (KStG — German Corporation Tax Act) at all or to
the full extent. Non-recognition would mean that adesso AG’s
loss carryforwards for trade tax and corporation tax purposes
would expire either in part or in full. Tax expenses in adesso
AG’s 2012 annual report would increase by EUR 783 thousand

(previous year: EUR 913 thousand) without the utilisation of
loss carryforwards and, since the loss carryforwards have been
utilised, bya total of EUR 4,681 thousand. Ifadesso’s financial
administration does not recognise this tax benefit, this amount
would have to be reported in the income statement and paid
out less interest on arrears of approximately EUR 0.4 million
(calculated as of 31 December 2012). In addition, the carrying
amountas of 31 December 2012 of deferred tax assets of EUR
5.0 million would have to be reversed on the income statement,
which would have substantial negative implications for adesso
AG’s asset, financial and profit situations.

evu.it GmbH’s loss carryforwards existing for trade tax and cor-
poration tax purposes as of its acquisition (April 2010) have
been utilised. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that
evu.it’s financial administration will not recognise the restruc-
turing of business operations in accordance with Article 8c (1)
Sentences 6 — 9 Kérperschaftssteuergesetz (KStG - German
Corporation Tax Act) at all or to the full extent. Non-recogni-
tion would mean that the companies’ loss carryforwards exist-
ing for trade tax and corporation tax purposes as of the acqui-
sition would expire either in part or in full. Tax expenses in
avu.it GmbH’s 2012 annual report would increase by EUR 0
thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand) without the utili-
sation of loss carryforwards and, since the loss carryforwards
have been utilised, by a total of EUR 242 thousand. As of the
reporting date, the carrying amount of evu.it GmbH’s loss car-
ryforwards existing as of the acquisition totalled EUR 34 thou-
sand. There were no notable risks from financial instruments.

Overall Statement Concerning the Group’s Risk
Situation

The overall risk profile of adesso has increased year on year. The
main reasons for this are the reduction in the net cash position,
increased risks asa result of internationalisation, increased pro-
ject and planning risks as well asa real risk from regulatory law.
In contrast, the risk profile was improved by reducing invest-
ment in the development of adesso products. None of the iden-
tified risks can be considered at the current point in time as risks
that endanger the existence of the company as a going concern.
However, the risks detailed above could have a negative impact
on theasset, financial and earnings situation as well as on busi-
ness performance.

Opportunities

adesso has introduced a series of measures to identify, assess
and monitor opportunities for positive group development.
Alongside sales information systems, these measures are
focused on organisational units for portfolio development
within the industry (Industry Groups), on the assessment
of new technological developments and on the evaluation of

52

the suitability of other industries (Strategy Group). With the
group further increasing in size, the systematic networking
of all units within adesso Group is leading to ever-increasing
synergy effects, particularly in sales, and an integrated service
approach for major customers.

In 2013, there will be a wide range of further opportunities to
expand business activities and increase profits. The Business
Intelligence and Telecommunication areas launched in 2012
have the potential to generate additional business in Germany.
The adesso platform drebis is to be expanded to include vehi-
cle damage claims in the automotive sector (previously only
legal protection). Marketing activities for the PSLife system in
the life insurance industry will be stepped up in 2013. One of
these measures has been the appointment of a dedicated man-
ager in order to speed up the positioning of the product on the
market. Newly founded adesso hosting services GmbH expands
adesso’s portfolio with new hosting and cloud services and also
offers adesso a basis for operator models. The restructuring of
the energy industry has substantial potential to increase prof-
its in comparison with the previous year.

The intensification of product internationalisation strategies
in the UK, Scandinavia and the USA over the course of 2013
will lead to additional business prospects in subsequent years
in terms of sales and in terms of profits. adesso is also planning
to enter the Turkish market, one of the most dynamic regions
in the world.

Internal Control System and
Risk Management System in
Terms of the Consolidated
Accounting Process

In the accounting process, there is a risk that the financial
reports based on the accounts could contain misrepresenta-
tions of facts that could have a significant influence on deci-
sions made by the intended recipients of the reports. These can
include the misallocation of resources and non-performance of
certain measures by the management in terms of the internal
operative management of the company and its subsidiaries, as
well as misinterpretation on the part of report recipients, and
particularly existing and potential shareholders. The processes
and systems established at adesso are geared toward identifying
potential sources of errors in the accounting process and thus
limiting the resulting risks; they are intended to ensure that the
annual report and consolidated financial statement are prepared
in accordance with legal requirements. The report is standard-
ised and identical in form for both the management report of
the annual financial statementas well as for the group manage-
ment report of adesso AG.

Atadesso, no control and risk management system was defined
and documented especially for the purposes of the accounting
process. There is no internal auditing structure or risk commit-
tee. No external advisors or auditors were engaged to review
the efficiency of the controls in place as part of the consolidated
accounting process. The structure of the internal control mech-
anisms and risk management system is the result of how the
accounting and reporting processes are organised.

The majority of the accounting is carried out decentrally by
each of the companies within adesso Group. As the parent com-
pany, adesso AG performs accounting services for some adesso
Group companies together with centralised administrative pro-
cesses such as payroll accounting. These companies’ accounts
are primarily kept on the same accounting system as clients.
The fact that the same people are responsible for this process
throughout the group and that the adesso AG CFO has ongoing,
direct access to the reporting and accounting processes provides
an outstanding basis for the standardised, correct representa-
tion of facts. Almost all companies use a standardised consoli-
dated accounts system, minimising the number of discrepan-
cies from the standard style of accounts. The extensive coverage
of group accounts means that it is simple to coordinate inter-
nal group performance processes. The respective management
teams are responsible for individual financial statements. Each

adesso AG Annual Report 2012

financial statement that forms part of the consolidated financial
statement is reviewed by the group auditor in terms ofits plau-
sibility and compliance with group standards, irrespective of
any audits performed by the local auditor or tax consultant. For
this purpose, the auditor of the consolidated financial statement
visits the respective local auditor and inspects documentation.

All individual financial statements are submitted to a central-
ised consolidation system in adesso AG’s Finance department
and consolidated into the consolidated financial statement in
accordance with the IFRS reconciliation statement. The soft-
ware solution specially procured for this purpose was audited
and certified in accordance with the “Erteilung und Verwend-
ung von Softwarebescheinigungen” auditing standards (‘“Issu-
ance and Use of Software Certificates”) published by the Insti-
tut der Wirtschaftpriifer in Deutschland e.V. (IDW PS 880).
AILIFRS reconciliation and consolidation processes are fully
documented and traceable.

The core elements of the control and risk management sys-
tem when it comes to accounting is the monthly, standardised
reporting of full monthly financial statements on the basis of
the consolidated accounts system, the comparison of actual
data with plan data and the quarterly update to the full-year
forecast. A member of the adesso AG Executive Board is directly
responsible for every company in adesso Group. These Execu-
tive Board members discuss monthly financial statements with
the respective company management and are thus able to iden-
tify abnormal developments and discrepancies. The monthly
financial statements of all companies are analysed monthly
by the adesso AG Executive Board. For the quarterly financial
statements, each company must prepare an extensive IFRS
package containing information for consolidation and details
of the notes. This allows the Finance department of adesso AG
to carry outa further audit of all information intended for exter-
nal reporting during the financial year. The auditor of the con-
solidated financial statement is referred to for selected issues.

Takeover-relevant Information

adesso reports in accordance with the specification taken from
the Ubernahmerichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz (UbernRLUG —
German act on the implementation of EU directive on takeover
bids) and assumed in Article 315 (4) HGB and Article 289 (4)
HGB with the aim of providing potential takeover bidders with
acomplete overview of adesso as well as any potential takeover
hurdles before they submit an offer.

There is only one type of share. Each common share grants one
vote. adesso shares do not have restricted transferability. The
Executive Board is not authorised to acquire its own shares
through adesso AG. As of the reporting date, adesso AG itself
held none of its own shares. In addition, we are not aware of
any other restrictions with regard to voting rights. In princi-
ple, there are no restrictions in respect of the transfer of adesso
shares. As of 31 December 2012, no adesso shares were subject
toalock-up agreement. We are not aware of any further restric-
tions that could arise from agreements between shareholders.
Further information on equity and the company’s capital meas-
ures can be found in the equity section of the notes.

As of 31 December 2012, founding shareholder and Super-
visory Board Chairman Prof. Dr. Volker Gruhn held 29.9 % of
share capital through a company he controls. Rainer Rudolf,
who was a member of the Executive Board until 30 September
2011, held 19.4 % of share capital at the time of his departure.
As of his voting rights announcement, Ludwig Fresenius held
10.1 % of share capital. Please see the notes to the annual report
and the consolidated financial statement for more information
on the company’s ownership structure. We are not aware of
any other direct or indirect share capital participations which
exceed 10 % of voting rights. As the shares in the company
are bearer shares, the company is in principle only notified of
changes to share ownership insofar as the changes of ownership
are subject to notification obligations and the respective par-
ties fulfil these obligations. The company is only made aware
of transactions that are completed within minimum and maxi-
mum notification thresholds in exceptional cases. Voting rights
announcements as well as the shareholder structure derived as
aresult are always kept up to date in the Investor Relations part
of the website at www.adresso-group.de.

The Articles of Association do not permit any adesso share-
holder to appoint members of the Supervisory Board. No share-
holder possesses any other special rights that confer them pow-
ers of control. There are no restrictions to the voting rights of
the adesso shares held by our employees.

Members of the Executive Board are appointed or dismissed
in accordance with Articles 84 and 85 AktG. The Executive

54

Board consists of at least one person in accordance with Article
6 of the Articles of Association. The Supervisory Board deter-
mines the number of Executive Board members, as well as the
appointment and dismissal of members and the appointment
of a member of the Executive Board as CEO. Changes to our
Articles of Association are carried out in accordance with Arti-
cles 179 and 133 AktG by means ofa resolution by the General
Meeting passed with a majority of at least three-quarters of the
share capital represented at said meeting. The Articles of Asso-
ciation do not contain any derogative provision. The Supervi-
sory Board is entitled to resolve changes to the wording of the
Articles of Association (Article 10 (7) of the Articles of Asso-
ciation). The resolutions of the General Meeting are decided
on the basis of a simple majority of submitted votes, unless a
different voting system is stipulated by law (Article 15 of the
Articles of Association).

The company is not part of any material agreement containing
special regulations in the event of a change of control or acqui-
sition of control, such as in the event of a takeover bid. Our
Articles of Association do not contain any provisions which
grant the Executive Board special powers in the event of a take-
over bid. Agreements concerning the phantom share plan stip-
ulate a shorter waiting period of phantom shareholders in the
event ofa change of control. Moreover, there are no agreements
with members of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board
or any employees concerning compensation in the event ofa
change of control.

Remuneration Report
Principles of the Remuneration System

Atadesso, variable remuneration systems are in place through-
out the group fora variety of functions. Management remuner-
ation is primarily geared toward the success of the company and
industry standards. Alongside basic remuneration, the adesso
AG Executive Board also receives a performance-related com-
ponent depending on the achievement of sales and operating
result targets at both an adesso AG level anda group level. One
component of the performance-related remuneration is con-
tingent on the achievement ofa fixed minimum result, another
on the level of target achievement targets over the course of the
previous financial year and a further component on the level of
target achievement over the course of the last four years and the
current year. Another component of the Executive Board’s vari-
able remuneration is share-based in the form of share options.
The Executive Board is part of the company-wide share option
scheme that is available to many employees. Some Executive
Board members have been assigned phantom shares as part of
a long-term incentive plan which bear a dividend through the
Executive Board member’s salary and, after a holding period,
provide the Executive Board member with a return value,
depending on the price of adesso shares. In accordance with
Article 11 of the Articles of Association, the members of the
Supervisory Board receive an annual salary plus expenses which
consists of a fixed component of EUR 5 thousand (the Chair-
person receives 1.5 times this amount) and a variable compo-
nent of 0.0275 % of the company’s balance sheet profit less 4%
of the paid-in contributions to the share capital. Further vari-
able remuneration systems are in place at various levels of the
corporate hierarchy. These are predominantly pegged to the
volume of services invoiced to customers, profit contributions
from business units or order intake in sales.

Please see the notes for more information on remuneration,
such as the amount and structure of the company’s Executive
Board and Supervisory Board remuneration.
