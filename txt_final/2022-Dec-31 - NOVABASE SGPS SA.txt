CHAIRMAN AND CEO'S MESSAGE

Dear Shareholders,

2022 was another year of growth at NOVABASE, validating the strategy that we have been
implementing.

Given the particularly difficult environment in which we operate, the results | present
below were only possible thanks the dedication and hard work of our entire team, to
whom | am grateful.

Turnover was up 18%, profiting from the international business that now represents
over 60% of the total. EBITDA also recorded a double-digit growth, despite inflationary
pressures on the cost side, while the Net Cash position remained solid, at around 40 M€.

The Value Portfolio business segment had a remarkable growth of 24%. On the other
hand, the rapid international expansion of the Next-Gen segment — an impressive
22% — has caused some challenges for several projects in the Middle East, which will
persist into 2023.

Volatility and inflationary pressures in financial markets, fuelled by the war in Ukraine,
stirred up the major stock markets in 2022. In fact, NOVABASE’s share price fell 21% in
2022, while the PSI All-Share index was up 2% and the EuroStoxx Tech index declined
28%.


--- Page 2 ---

n 2022, NOVABASE paid 0.43 €/share to shareholders following the Company's capital
reduction operation, and the Board of Directors intends to distribute the remaining
0.42 €/share by the end of 2023, according to the Strategic Update 2019+.

Despite the good organic performance, the delay of at least two years caused by the
pandemic, made the Next-Gen Turnover target for 2023 set in Strategic Update 2019+
unachievable without acquisitions.

Furthermore, mounting internationalization costs, rising labour costs and investments to
reposition some offerings will continue to pressure profitability.

From a macroeconomic standpoint, there is great uncertainty in our key European
markets, given the latent threat of recession.

n this context, it will take longer than expected to achieve our goals, and considering
the Company's balance sheet, the Board of Directors approved, on 16 February 2023,
a tender offer to purchase the company’s own shares up to 20% of capital, creating an
additional opportunity for shareholder remuneration.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

NOVABASE has been a publicly-traded company since July 2000. It operates according
to a governance model whose suitability and performance are assessed regularly by the
Board of Directors to help optimise its performance in closer alignment with the interests of
all stakeholders — those interested in NOVABASE’s corporate activities, namely shareholders,
investors, customers, suppliers, other business partners and employees.

In view of the mounting challenges of internationalization and competition revolving
around NOVABASE's business, the corporate governance system in place at the company
needed to be brought up to date by simplifying and streamlining company bodies
and procedures, so as to tailor existing solutions to the Company's size and specific
circumstances.

Therefore, beginning in 2015, NOVABASE adopted a reinforced Latin corporate governance
model comprised of a Board of Directors, Audit Board and Statutory Auditor (ROC). In this
model, a substantially more agile day-to-day management structure was implemented,
with the Board of Directors able to delegate the day-to-day running of the Company
to one or more directors (delegated-directors) or to an Executive Committee of 3 to 9
members.


--- Page 8 ---

Following the General Meeting of Shareholders of 25 May 2021 (which, among other
decisions, elected the members of the corporate boards and Remuneration Committee for
three-year period of 2021-2023), for the purpose of implementing a substantially more agile
day-to-day management structure, the elected Board of Directors delegated NOVABASE's
daily management to delegated-directors Luis Paulo Cardoso Salvado and Alvaro José da
Silva Ferreira, thereby not creating an Executive Committee for this term of office. Along
these lines, the decision was made to grant special responsibilities to director Maria del
Carmen Gil Marin, pursuant to article 407, paragraph 1 of the Commercial Companies
Code. In addition, in the General Meeting of Shareholders held on 24 May 2022, directors
Benito Vazquez Blanco and Francisco Paulo Figueiredo Morais Antunes were elected. On
2 June 2022, the Board of Directors decided to grant certain special responsibilities to
director Francisco Paulo Figueiredo Morais Antunes, pursuant to and for the purposes
of article 407, paragraph 1 of the Commercial Companies Code. The activities of these
delegated-directors are supervised by the non-executive directors.

Moreover, NOVABASE has a General Meeting Board elected for three-year terms of office,
along with a Remuneration Committee appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders
to establish the remuneration of each corporate board member based on the duties
performed and the Company's financial status. The Company also designates a Secretary
and respective substitute, under the terms of article 446-A of the Commercial Companies
Code, to perform the duties established by law.

NOVABASE constantly analyses the implementation of this model in order to refine its
corporate governance practices, whenever possible, and tailor the model to the demands
and challenges faced by the Company.

RISKS
e FINANCIAL RISKS

NOVABASE's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, namely Foreign exchange
risk, Interest rate risk (cash flows and fair value), Credit risk, Liquidity risk and Capital
management risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the
evolution of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the
Group's financial performance.

The uncertainties existing at the end of 2021 due to inflationary pressures remained
and intensified in 2022, with this year being marked by increases in key interest rates
by several central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal
Reserve (FED). Geopolitical risks were in the spotlight throughout the year, having been
exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, also contributing to aggravating inflationary
pressures, namely in oil and other raw materials.

More information on each of the financial risks to which NOVABASE is exposed to,
listed below, can be found in the “Financial Risk Management Policy” note included in
the Accounts, an integral part of this Consolidated Report and Accounts, and for which
reading is advised.

Foreign exchange risk

NOVABASE is exposed to foreign exchange risk, mainly arising from U.S. Dollar, since
some subsidiaries perform transactions in this currency, but also arising from Kwanza and
British Pound.

The finance department is responsible for monitoring the evolution of exchange rates
of the currencies referred above, seeking to mitigate the impact of their fluctuations in
consolidated results. Whenever expectations of changes in exchange rates justify it, the
Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge those exposures.

Interest rate risk (cash flows and fair value)

Interest rate risk reflects the possibility of fluctuations in future interest charges in loans
obtained, as a result of changes in market interest rate levels.

The Group's financial liabilities are indexed to short-term reference interest rates, revised
in periods equal or shorter than one year plus duly negotiated risk spreads. Hence,
changes in interest rates can impact NOVABASE’s results.

NOVABASE's exposure to interest rates arises from financial assets and _ liabilities
contracted with a fixed and/or floating rate. In the first case, the Group faces a risk of fair
value variation in these assets or liabilities, since every change in market rates involves
an opportunity cost. In the second case, such change has a direct impact on interest
expense, consequently causing cash variations.

Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored continuously by the finance department. The
purpose of managing interest rate risk is to reduce the volatility of interest expenses.


--- Page 20 ---

Credit risk

NOVABASE's credit risk is managed, simultaneously, on a business units’ level, for the
outstanding amounts of trade and other receivables, and on a Group basis, for financial
instruments.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, and
credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed
transactions. For banks and financial institutions, only credible well-rated counterparties
are accepted. Credit risk management of trade and other receivables is based in credit
limit ranges, considering the financial position of the customer and past experience.

Liquidity risk

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable
securities, and the availability of financing through an adequate amount of committed
credit facilities and the possibility to close out market positions.

Management monitors updated forecasts of NOVABASE's liquidity reserve (which
comprises undrawn committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents)
on the basis of expected cash flows, taking into account the analysis of the remaining
contractual maturity of the financial liabilities and the expected date of financial assets
inflows. Additionally, the maturity concentration of borrowings and liabilities of NOVABASE
are regularly monitored.

Capital management risk

NOVABASE's objectives when managing capital, which is a broader concept than the
equity disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position, are:

1. Safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and hence to provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;

2. Maintain a solid capital structure to support the development of its business;
3. Maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Management monitors the Return on Capital ® ratio, which measures NOVABASE's ability
to generate cashflows in relation to the capital invested in its business.

® Determined by the formula: Operating Profit + Total Equity.

25

26

e EMERGING RISKS

In addition to the financial risks inherent to its activity, NOVABASE is also exposed to
operational and business risks, which can be materialised into threats and opportunities,
and proactively develops adequate mitigation strategies. From those, we highlight:

Cyber-risks

The growing sophistication and integration of technologies increased the companies’
exposure to several cyber-risks (such as large-scale cyber-attacks, violation and
destruction of data, extortion attempts, etc.), with possible financial, operational and
reputational losses. The shift to working from home (WFH) and the invasion of Ukraine by
Russia, led to a significant increase of the exposure to this risk.

According to IBM’s “Intelligence Index” annual report released in February 2023, Portugal
was considered the third European country most affected by cyber-attacks detected in
2022, just after the United Kingdom and Germany, responding to 9% of cases.

NOVABASE has been reinforcing measures to mitigate this risk, supervised directly by
the Chief Information Security Officer, namely by strengthening technological security
controls and, furthermore, focusing on training on good WFH practices and cybercrime
awareness.

Talent retention risk

NOVABASE's ability for the success of its strategy depends on its ability to attract and
retain top talent for each position.

The acceleration of digital transformation and the new labour dynamics since the
beginning of the pandemic, driven by fierce competition for scarce talent, have brought
huge challenges to talent management, which translates into an increase in IT wages and
increased difficulties in employee attraction, and especially in employee retention.

In fact, according to the recent study “2022 European Great Attrition, Great Attraction” by
McKinsey & Company (conducted in September 2022), one in three European workers
expect to quit their jobs in the next three to six months, despite the likely economic
slowdown, revealing that talent retention will continue to be a key challenge in 2023.

NOVABASE's human resources policies are aligned to achieve the strategic objectives,
having been adapted and reinforced in view of the new reality, namely through the
adoption of a hybrid work model with 60% of remote work (since 2021), the continuous
improvement of benefits and working conditions, a good on-boarding process, investment
in training, among others.

Delivery ris|
NOVABASE's policies to address delivery risk include, among others, the following:

« Analysis of each significant commercial proposal in order to reduce possible
overselling, considering the available internal capacity;

« Permanent scrutiny of the quality of the team to be allocated to the projects;


--- Page 22 ---

e« Maintenance of permanent training programmes in technologies (namely in New-
Generation information technologies) and project management methodologies.

The Nearshore Agile delivery model that NOVABASE refined in recent years has shown its
resilience during and in the post-pandemic.

Strategic and contextual risks

NOVABASE is not immune to the contingencies of the markets in which it operates,
still facing the so-called “strategic and context risks". The current geopolitical and
macroeconomic environment, with the war in Ukraine and a latent threat of recession in
Europe, increased the levels of uncertainty and unpredictability. In January, the head of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned 2023 will be “tougher” than last year,
predicting that one third of the world economy to be in recession, as the main engines of
global growth - the United States, Europe and China - all experience weakening activity.

NOVABASE seeks to manage and mitigate these risks through practices of recurring
discussion, at the level of the various management chains, on the risks that impact on
society / business unit. These discussions address areas of investment / divestment,
strategic bets and pending risks at all times, and where the risk appetite at the level of the
organisation and its evolution is also discussed.

Risks associated with climate change

While NOVABASE does not have a significant carbon footprint nor is it directly exposed
to physical climate change risk, these factors are considered when making investment
decisions. NOVABASE's performance is crucial in the context of generating return for
shareholders, as well as in the context of the wider economy and well-being of the
broader community in which it operates.

Aware of its role, NOVABASE has been progressively adopting a more rigorous and robust
approach to:

« Identify, manage and mitigate climate related risks;
« Identify and maximise climate change generated opportunities;

« Report on how physical and transitional risks associated with climate related risks
are managed and what initiatives have been developed, from the point of view of
environmental preservation, towards a more sustainable low carbon economy.

Among the implemented policies, note that NOVABASE hasan Environmental Management
System (ISO 14001) and a policy with environmental requirements pertaining to the
acquisition / supply of goods and services.

More information about the initiatives developed, including the evolution of a set of
environmental indicators, can be found in the NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS section of
this Report, and for which reading is advised.

OUTLOOK

The main bets and challenges for 2023 are the growth of international business and
talent pool in a year of great uncertainty

The outlook for this year is one of great uncertainty, namely due to Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, which has contributed to rising inflation and an increased risk of economy falling
into recession.

In 2023, NOVABASE will continue to focus on the growth of its international activity and
its talent pool, however both will continue to be major challenges in an increasingly
competitive and uncertain market.

Our main target markets are going through a difficult context which translates into rising
wage inflation and costs of internationalisation on a larger scale, making 2023 a year of
great uncertainty and extremely challenging.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The following relevant facts occurred in 2023 up to the date of issue of this report:

Public Offer for the acquisition NOVABASE’ shares

On 16 February 2023, NOVABASE made public the decision to launch a partial and
voluntary tender offer for the acquisition of a maximum of 6,280,279 shares, that is 20%
of its share capital, by a consideration of 4.85 Euros. The launch of this offer was subject
to certain conditions, namely the prior approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders of the Company's individual balance sheet as at 31 December, the share
capital reduction by reduction of the nominal value of all shares representing the share
capital, the reduction of share capital through the cancelation of own shares to be
acquired in the context of the offer and obtaining the prior registration of the offer with
the Portuguese Securities Market Commission.

On 13 March 2023, the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders was held, with all
items on the agenda having been approved (see also item on Share Capital Reductions).
The Public Offer was registered with the Portuguese Securities Market Commission and
the prospectus was published on March 28, having the offer period runned between
29 March 2023 and 18 April 2023.

As a result of the offer, NOVABASE acquired 3,558,550 shares representing 11.33% of
its share capital, thus, the total held after the public tender offer is 5,623,757 shares,
representing 17.91% of its share capital. The settlement of the offer took place on 21 April
2023.

Temporary suspension of the buy-back programme

On 16 February 2023, NOVABASE also announced the temporary suspension of the share
buy-back programme of the Company launched in 29 September 2021, following the
publication of the preliminary announcement of a public tender offer over own shares.

Since 1 January 2023 and up to the suspension of the buy-back programme on 16 February
2023 (inclusive), NOVABASE acquired 17,794 treasury shares on the market at an average


--- Page 24 ---

net price of 4.17 Euros, whereby on that date NOVABASE held 2,065,207 treasury shares
(962,194 of which through its subsidiary Novabase Consulting, S.G.P.S., S.A.), representing
6.58% of the share capital.

Share Capital Reductions

On 13 March 2023, the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders approved a
reduction in the nominal value of all shares representing the NOVABASE share capital,
with the purpose of release the necessary reserves to the completion of the Public Offer
announced on 16 February, and the reduction of share capital through the cancelation of
own shares to be acquired in the context of the offer.

On 16 March, NOVABASE announced that a reduction in the nominal value of all shares
representing NOVABASE’ share capital was submitted to registry before the Lisbon
Commercial Registry Office. As a result of the registration of said operation, the share
capital of NOVABASE was reduced from 32,971,463.70 Euros to 942,041.82 Euros, with
a reduction in the nominal unit value of the shares representing the total share capital of
NOVABASE to 0.03 Euros.

As in 2022, some financing contracts do not foresee a capital reduction, so NOVABASE
informed this capital reduction to the banks, having received their formal consent.
Additionally, NOVABASE assessed the impact of this reduction on compliance with the
remaining debt covenants, with the non-achievement of the solvability ratio in relation
to one of the financing contracts being expected. The next calculation of the ratio will
only take place on 31 December 2023.

Following the announcement of the results of the public tender offer for acquisition of
NOVABASE's own shares, on 21 April NOVABASE has submitted to registry the reduction
of its share capital through the cancellation of 3,558,550 own shares acquired in the
context of the offer. As a result of the registration of said operation, the share capital of
NOVABASE was reduced by 106,756.50 Euros, to 835,285.32 Euros, being represented by
27,842,844 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 0.03 Euros each.

Suspension of the duty to launch a general tender offer over NOVABASE

Following the settlement of the results of the public tender offer launched by NOVABASE
over its own shares, a holding of 52.51% of NOVABASE’s voting rights are attributable
to the company HNB - SGPS, S.A. and Pedro Miguel Quinteiro Marques de Carvalho,
corresponding to the holding by them, directly or through the shareholders agreement
currently in force to which they are signatories, thus exceeding the limit of half of the
voting rights in this Company, which triggers the duty to launch a general tender offer for
the acquisition of the shares representing the share capital of NOVABASE.

Therefore, HNB and Pedro Carvalho announced their intention to terminate the situation
that generated the duty to launch a tender offer, namely by terminating the shareholders’
agreement to which they are signatories, within 120 days from the date of settlement of
the tender offer launched by NOVABASE.

Intention to distribute 0.42 Euros per share to shareholders

On 16 February 2023, the Board of Directors announced that maintains its intention
to distribute, by the end of 2023, the 0.42 Euros per share yet to be paid according to
Strategy 20219+.

As described in the Proposal For The Allocation Of Profits included in the Management
Report, which is an integral part of this Annual Financial Report, the Board of Directors will
propose to the 2023 Annual General Meeting the distribution of a dividend to shareholders
of 0.10 Euros per share, which will correspond to a payment of 2,784,284.40 Euros, relative
to the total number of shares issued, taking into account the capital reduction operations
performed in the meantime, after 31 December 2022.

Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy

On 10 March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) became insolvent after its customers
made massive withdrawals, leading the US authorities to close it. The collapse of the
SVB is the major collapse of a US bank since 2008. Despite SVB being a niche bank
(particularly important for tech companies and startups) and not being at the top of the
sector's biggest banks, there are shockwaves hitting Wall Street's financial giants: stock
markets plummeted, the New York-based Signature Bank (one of the main banks to
the cryptocurrency industry) was closed by the authorities citing systemic risk, Moody's
placed six US banks under review for a possible downgrade and fears of a new financial
crisis reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis raised.

NOVABASE has no exposure and/or commercial relationship with SVB, namely through its
participated company Feedzai, S.A., and is not directly impacted by the current situation
of bankruptcy of the American bank.

PROPOSAL FOR THE ALLOCATION
OF RESULTS

To resolve on the proposal for the application of results.

Whereas:

1.

In the financial year 2022, Novabase presented a net result of EUR 3,794,781.34 (three
million, seven hundred and ninety four thousand, seven hundred and eighty one euros
and thirty four cents) in the individual accounts;

The Company's individual account, as at 31 December 2022, shows legal reserves
in the amount of 3,140,139.40 (three million, one hundred and forty thousand, one
hundred and thirty-nine euros and forty cents).

According to the Law and the articles of association, 5% of the net income for the
year is allocated to the legal reserve reinforcement, until it represents at least 20%
of the share capital. Therefore, although on 31 December 2022 the legal reserves
constituted do not represent 20% of Novabase share capital, considering the capital
reduction operations carried out in the meantime, after 31 December 2022, the
amount allocated to the legal reserves account reaches the minimum legally required,
not becoming, on the other hand, the Company's equity lower than the sum of the
capital and reserves that the Law or the articles of association do not allow to be
distributed to the shareholders, as a result of the intended application of results and
distribution of retained earnings.

On 16 February 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company announced that it
maintains its intention to distribute, until the end of 2023, the EUR 0.42 (forty-two
cents) per share still to be paid in accordance with the Estratégia 2019+. The intended
distribution will result in a total dividend to shareholders of EUR 0.10 (ten cents) per
share, subject to approval by the General Meeting, which corresponds to an amount
equivalent to 73.37% of individual net result.

33


--- Page 29 ---

34

In accordance with legal and statutory provisions, the Board of Directors proposes the
following distribution of results:

1) From the net result of the year mentioned above, taking into account the capital reduction
operations carried out in the meantime, after 31 December 2022, EUR 2,784,284.40 (two
million, seven hundred and eighty four thousand, two hundred and eighty four euros and
forty cents) be paid to shareholders, corresponding to a payment of EUR 0.10 (ten cents);

2) That, as it is not possible to accurately determine the number of own shares held in
treasury on the date of the abovementioned payment without limiting the Company's
intervention capacity, notably in the increase of liquidity in its securities, the overall sum
of EUR 2,784,284.40 (two million, seven hundred and eighty four thousand, two hundred
and eighty four euros and forty cents) as provided for in the foregoing paragraph, based
on an unit amount per issued share (in this case, EUR 0.10 (ten cents) per share), be
distributed as follows:

a. That the unit amount of EUR 0.10 (ten cents) be paid to each issued share;
b. That the unit amount corresponding to the own shares held in treasury on the date
of payment as referred to above is not paid, but maintained in the reserves and retained
earnings.
3) That the remaining amount of the net result for the year, in the amount of EUR
1,010,496.94 (one million, ten thousand, four hundred and ninety six euros and ninety
four cents), be transferred to retained earnings.

Lisbon, 27 April 2023

NON-FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

PART I — INFORMATION ON POLICIES

A. INTRODUCTION | THE NOVABASE GROUP

Pursuant to article 508-G of the Commercial Companies Code, as amended by Decree
Law no. 89/2017 of 28 July, which transposed Directive 2014/95/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 into Portuguese legislation, NOVABASE
explains in this document the “information for a sufficient understanding of the
developments, performance, position and impact of the group's activities, at minimum
with regard to environmental, social and employee-related issues, equality between men
and women, non-discrimination, respect for human rights and fighting corruption and
attempted bribery’ in relation to the NOVABASE Group for the year ending 31 December
2022.

Information on the NOVABASE Group's business and corporate structure is available in
the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts (Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ending 31 December 2022), as well as in the 2022 Corporate Governance
Report(Part |, Section B., Point 21).

B. BUSINESS MODEL

This information is described in Part |, Letter B., Section Il. “ADMINISTRATION AND
SUPERVISION (Board of Directors, Executive Board of Directors and General and
Supervisory Board)" from the 2022 Corporate Governance Report.

C. MAIN RISK FACTORS

The NOVABASE Group is subject to both standard market risks and specific risks related
to its business. NOVABASE believes that the risk management policy is of vital importance
in running and developing a business which has historically had a higher risk appetite
profile, since this is intrinsically necessary in such a dynamic and disruptive sector.

NOVABASE also has internal control systems and procedures to prevent and manage risks
within the context of its organization and activities.

Additional information on NOVABASE’s internal control and risk management can be
found in Part |, Letter C, Section Ill. “Internal Control and Risk Management” of the 2022
Corporate Governance Report.

D. POLICIES IMPLEMENTED
i. Environment

NOVABASE has implemented an Environmental Management System (ISO 14001) as
part of its Integrated Management System (Quality, Environment, Occupational Health
and Safety). The Integrated Management System is governed by a policy which has
been incorporated into NOVABASE’s vision and values and aligned with the needs of
stakeholders. Internal and external audits are done annually, the latter by certifying
entities. As in 2021, no non-conformities were found in 2022.

NOVABASE has a policy which identifies environmental and safety requirements to be
met for the acquisition/provision of goods and services.

NOVABASE monitors several indicators: consumption of electricity, thermal energy,
water, diesel and gas; recycling of plastic, cardboard, paper and glass; and the emission
of greenhouse gases.

In 2022, hybrid work began gaining more weight, and consequently became the most

balanced model for NOVABASE in the post-COVID-19 era. The following indicators were
noteworthy in 2022:

ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION (MW/H)

2019 2020 2021 2022

Eo EE xc MB onto

Measures implemented: Centralized Management System to control operating times,
replacement of all fluorescent lighting with LED lighting.

THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION (MW)

649 550 397 514

2019 2020 2021 2022

Measures implemented: Centralized Management System to control operating times of
the climate control system. In the third quarter, we implemented thermal insulation for

61

heat exchangers, and thermal insulation for primary circuit accessories (valves, filter and
picking) of the substation of the thermal plant.

WATER CONSUMPTION (M?)

1091 1241 173 745 359 1251 349

2019 2020 2021 2022

Measures implemented: decreased water flow and installation of regulating valves in
faucets.

TOTAL PAPER CONSUMPTION (KG)

Measures implemented: Awareness on decreasing the use of paper. Identification of
suppliers who send hardcopy invoices, followed by a request for electronic billing.

PLASTIC PRODUCTION (KG)

2019 2020 2021 2022

The volume of plastic waste rose considerably after the start of the pandemic, justified by
lower employee confidence in using glass cups and bottles available for common use in

the break rooms. For this reason, disposable water bottles needed to be made available
again.

As shown in the following table, our fleet has a total of 78 plug-in hybrid vehicles and 16
electric vehicles.

In addition to measures already known (e.g. remote meetings, video calls, the existence
of offices in other regions), other measures to offset these emissions are being analysed.
ii. Social and Fiscal

NOVABASE has implemented a number of measures aimed at well-being and a balance
between the professional, family and personal lives of its employees. Some noteworthy
measures include: General health appointments, at no charge, twice per week, osteopathy
appointments, psychology appointments, at no charge, to help all those in need (with
guaranteed anonymity), healthy breakfast in partnership with “Celeiro”.

NOVABASE implemented the “Second Life” program for equipment at the end of its
professional life, allowing NOVABASE Group employees to use this equipment at home.

107 pieces of equipment were sold in 2022.

In 2022, NOVABASE developed and participated in several welfare initiatives, including
the following:

¢ Ukrainian refugees
¢ 30 laptops;
¢ “Casa de Sdo Bento” school
« Alaptops
« Johnson Academy
* 80 backpacks
* Celfocus
« “Zero Waste Policy": meaning that any material sent or given to the people of
Celfocus should have a utility and useful life beyond the time denoted. Being useful

and reusable is a matter of principle.

¢ Volunteer program “What matters to you": allowing everyone to take one work day
to volunteer at an institution of their choice.

The results of the initiatives carried out in 2022 were:
« What matters to you — 48 hours of volunteering by 9 employees.

« Monetary donation — €8,500 Ukraine Support, Donation to Red Cross and Fortés
Sempre

* Courier services — delivery of goods to institutions.
« Neotalent

* Donation of materials (blankets, decks of cards, pens) to C.A.S.A.

¢« Donation of perishable foods to REFOOD

« Registry in job platforms created to address Ukrainian refugees who may arrive in
the country, following the war

iii. Employees and Gender Equality and Non-Discrimination

Council of Ministers Resolution no. 19/2012 of 8 March 2012 requires the mandatory
adoption of an equality plan by all entities in the state corporate sector, with a view to
achieving equal treatment and equal opportunities between men and women, eliminating
discrimination and reconciling personal, family and professional life.

This obligation was extended to listed companies through Law no. 62/2017 of 1 August,
which passed the scheme for equal representation between men and women in the
managing and supervisory boards of entities from the corporate public sector and listed
companies. Article 7 of this law establishes the obligation to prepare annual equality
plans “aimed at effectively achieving equal treatment and equal opportunities between
men and women, eliminating gender discrimination and reconciling personal, family and
professional life”.

In this context, on 8 September 2022, NOVABASE presented a new version of its Gender
Equality and Diversity Plan with measures and practices for the years 2022/2023, including
the following:

e« Continued use and promotion of inclusive language both inside and outside the
company;

e Give-away of book “O Longo Caminho para a Igualdade (“The Long Way To Equality”)
to new employees in onboarding kit;

¢ Communication and awareness activities;
¢ Consolidation of partnership with Valor T (employment agency for disabled persons);

e« Sharing and dissemination of mentoring programs, namely the PWN program
(Professional Women’s Network).

The key indicator is the proportion of men and women vis-a-vis all employees, which
should tend to be balanced. In 2022, this indicator had a proportion of 69% men and 31%
women, in line with the result from 2021.

At NOVABASE, we believe in equal opportunities and mutual respect regardless of ethnicity,
gender, religion, beliefs, social background or sexual orientation. These differences tend
to enhance the quality of decision-making processes through multiple perspectives,
greater intellectual and cultural richness and a better representation of reality and of
those involved.

For this reason, we also believe that diversity in our corporate boards helps to improve
NOVABASE's performance and competitiveness. As such, we are committed to the
following policy:

¢« Compliance with Law no. 62/2017 of 01 August, since gender diversity provides

65


--- Page 61 ---

66

different management styles and complementary approaches;

« With regard to age, there must be a balance between experience and maturity and the
youth and energy needed for the fast-paced innovation of our highly dynamic sector
(information technologies);

« With regard to qualifications and education, in addition to areas associated with
technology, various other areas of knowledge must also be represented, in view of
the mounting importance of multidisciplinarity in team performance.

NOVABASE will monitor this policy's implementation, in accordance with its corporate
governance model, and will review it whenever deemed appropriate.

iv. Human Rights

NOVABASE ensures and has specific principles related to (i) respecting human rights (ii)
collective bargaining, and (iii) guaranteed non-existence of child and forced/mandatory
labour. It has a Code of Conduct, which was reviewed and approved by the Board of
Directors in 2021, to solidify these principles. This Code lays out the principles and
rules governing NOVABASE’s relationships with its stakeholders, in the broadest sense.
They represent a commitment to NOVABASE'’s customers and partners, but also a
commitment by and to its employees in terms of how they relate with the company
and among themselves. It covers a range of topics from integrity, transparency, respect,
health and safety, the use of information, intellectual property, the use of resources,
social and environmental responsibility, managing conflicts of interest, corruption and
bribery, including various aspects such as legal compliance, best environmental and
labour practices, including human rights, and applying these principles in third-party
procurement. The Code of Conduct is available at the website's institutional area and
on the Intranet. Our ethical concerns also extend to our suppliers and partners. The
principles and rules described in NOVABASE’s Code of Conduct must be strictly followed
by any partner or supplier working with NOVABASE, and incorporated into their day-
to-day routines. In its contractual agreements with suppliers, NOVABASE includes a
commitment to adhere to NOVABASE’s Code of Conduct.

v. Anti-Corruption and Attempted Bribery

NOVABASE has adopted a whistleblowing system for reporting irregularities (known as
“SPI") that may occur within the Group, which is detailed at the NOVABASE website (www.
novabase.com).

The reporting of irregularities through the SPI is directed to the Chairperson of the Audit
Board, with the Audit Board designating the entity or person who will follow up on
communications received ("Head of SPI"). The Head of SPI must act independently and
autonomously (notwithstanding responsibility to the Audit Board for proper compliance
with his/her duties) and will be subject to confidentiality requirements. The company also
has “Internal Regulation on Transactions with Related Parties” in effect.

After the publication of Law no. 93/2021 of 20 December, which establishes the
general scheme for protecting whistleblowers, transposing Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of
the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 into the Portuguese
legal system, NOVABASE revised the SPI to adapt the system to the requirements of the


--- Page 62 ---

new law, particularly with regard to the protection of whistleblowers, who now have
access to a direct and confidential channel for reporting to the Audit Board any potential
irregularity, regardless of its nature, occurring in the NOVABASE Group, regardless of any
blame that may be attributed, and which may impact the financial statements or the
information sent to the Portuguese Securities Market Commission (“CMVM"), or that may
cause serious damage to NOVABASE or its stakeholders (employees, customers, partners
and shareholders).

Council of Ministers Resolution no. 37/2021 of 6 April passed the 2020-2024 National
Anti-Corruption Strategy, which calls all sectors, including the private corporate sector, to
be part of a joint anti-corruption effort primarily focused on the prevention of corruptive
phenomena.

NOVABASE, fully aware of these risks, albeit potential, sought to identify them through
the Prevention Plan for the Risks of Corruption and Related Offences in the specific
ecosystem to which NOVABASE belongs and address them, thereby ensuring that our
corporate culture is rooted in the fundamental values of legality, uprightness, trust and
ethics. NOVABASE approved the Plan in December 2021 and published it at its website.

PART II — INFORMATION ON STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOLLOWED

In view of the NOVABASE Group's size, the nature of its business, its business model and
the industries in which it operates, no formal policies have been approved for all of the
items referred to in article 508-G (2) of the Commercial Companies Code. Nonetheless,
various aspects of the NOVABASE Group's business are governed by applicable legislation,
and by applicable regulations and recommendations of the Portuguese Securities Market
Commission and other domestic and international entities. In addition, the NOVABASE
Group internally uses a number of reference documents, diligence proceedings and
systems regarding practices to be employed in certain areas, taking the Group and its
needs into account, together with its employees, professionals and other stakeholders,
with a view to ensuring sustainable growth. NOVABASE Group companies are also
subject to a number of different internal and external audits. In this context, the main
aspects, documents, practices and processes in place at the NOVABASE Group, which it
believes have an impact on non-financial issues relevant to the Group (namely involving
the environment, society, labour, gender equality, non-discrimination, human rights and
the fight against corruption), are listed below:

ACTIVITIES ELIGIBLE FOR TAXONOMY

Anassessment was done of the NOVABASE Group's economic activities, which concluded
that those eligible for Taxonomy and generating turnover for the Group are as follows:

¢« 8.1.Dataprocessing, hosting and related activities: Storage, manipulation, management,
movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission or processing of
data through data centres, including edge computing (NACE code: J.63.11);

« 8.2. Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions: Development or use of ICT
solutions that are aimed at collecting, transmitting, storing data and at its modelling
and use where those activities are predominantly aimed at the provision of data and
analytics enabling GHG emission reductions. Such ICT solutions may include, inter alia,
the use of decentralized technologies (i.e. distributed ledger technologies), Internet of
Things (loT), 5G and Artificial Intelligence (NACE code: J.61, J.62 and J.63.11).

TURNOVER

Turnover corresponds to total sales originating from Taxonomy-aligned economic
activities. Therefore, the eligible numerator corresponds to the portion of turnover
originating from the eligible activities of “8.1 Data processing, hosting and related
activities” and “8.2 Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions”. The denominator
corresponds to the Group’s total turnover in 2022.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Eligible operating expenses correspond to the portion related to assets and taxonomy-
related economic activities, including all non-capitalized direct costs originating from
research and development (R&D) activities, acquisition costs for the production of
taxonomy-aligned economic activities and with individual measures enabling the
transformation of these activities into low-carbon activities or activities which reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

The amount used for the calculation shown in the table corresponds to average electricity
costs for charging electric vehicles at the Group's facilities in 2022.
