BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS

1.3.
1.3.1. THE FOUNDATIONS OF A WINNING STRATEGY
1.3.1.1. Beauty: Our one and only business

For over a century, L’Oréal has continually devoted itself to the
same business: beauty, in which it is the world’s leading
company. Beauty is the Group’s raison d’étre, because far
from being futile and superficial, cosmetics are full of meaning.
They give everyone self-confidence, enable them to blossom
and open up to others and contribute to individual and
collective well-being.

Boasting an_ international portfolio of 32diverse and
complementary brands, the Group is committed to
responding to all beauty aspirations worldwide. Present in all
distribution channels, L'Oréal generated sales of €25.26 billion
in 2015 thanks to the efforts made by its 82,881 employees
across the globe.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS

1.3.1.2. One mission: Beauty for all

Our mission: to offer women and men worldwide the best of
cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy and safety, to meet the
infinite diversity of beauty needs and desires all over the world.

1.3.1.3. Counting on research, innovation
and quality: inventing the future of

beauty

With 3,871 researchers and a budget representing 3.1% of its
sales, L’Oréal has the largest research and innovation team in
the cosmetics industry. The Group continues to develop its
innovation capabilities through its global research centres in
France and increases its research budget very regularly.
L'Oréal invests in all fields, from Advanced Research to
formulation. The cosmetics market is a supply-led market
fuelled by innovation, where consumers are always looking for
novel products and improved performances. More than ever,
success and growth is driven by “new, different, better’
products, which proves the relevance of L'Oréal’s business
model based on research excellence and creative marketing.

By focusing on innovation, L’Oréal can always remain one step
ahead.

1.3.1.4. The portfolio of cosmetics brands:
offering the best of beauty in each
distribution channel

The Group has the richest, most varied and most powerful
brand portfolio in the cosmetics industry, enabling it to meet
the beauty expectations of consumers all over the world. Its
brands are constantly being reinvented so that they are
always a perfect match with consumer demand.

New acquisitions also regularly provide valuable additions to
this unique portfolio.

Some of these acquisitions are of global brands such as Urban
Decay, the US make-up brand which makes a tremendous
contribution to the L’Oréal Luxe portfolio; NYX Cosmetics, an
affordable, make-up artist-inspired brand; and Decléor and
Carita, which extend the growth potential of Professional
Products to the field of professional skincare.

Other acquisitions are aimed at extending the Group’s
geographical footprint: in Colombia with the make-up brand
Vogue, in Kenya with Interbeauty, in Brazil with Niely
Cosméticos, and in China with Magic Holdings, a specialist in
facial masks. These newly acquired companies are helping to
accelerate the Group’s penetration of their markets in a
spectacular manner and drive organic growth going forward.

1.3.1.5. A single development strategy:
Universalisation

L’Oréal relies on its single “Universalisation’ strategy, meaning
globalisation that respects differences. This strategy aims at
offering beauty attuned to the specific expectations of
consumers in every region of the world. Unlike standardisation,
“Universalisation’ is based on a keen ability to listen to
consumers and a profound respect for their differences.

The Group’s research and marketing teams pay heed to
consumers across the globe. The laboratories on all continents
study the specificities of consumers. The Group's innovation
policy is based on accessibility and on the adaptation of
products to the beauty rituals and lifestyles of all men and
women in their infinite diversity.

To make Universalisation a really powerful strategy, the global
market has been organised into eight homogeneous strategic
regions, even more attentive to consumers and closer to their
expectations. The Group’s organisation is now resolutely
multicentric, with a strong “nerve centre” based in France.
Each major region of the world now has its own centre of
expertise which groups together research and marketing
activities. Research therefore has 5 hubs across the globe, led
by central teams and fuelled by the Group’s core expertise
and fundamental knowledge.

1.3.1.6. A priority focus on Human Resources
and an unswerving corporate culture

L’Oréal has always been guided by humanist values that have
led it to place the individual and talent at the heart of its
organisation. These strategic intangible assets are one of the
Group's main competitive advantages in the long term,
alongside its brands, governance and research.

The Group’s human and social project revolves around two
priorities: the first is individual performance development of
employees and future leaders and the second is social
performance.

In this field, L'Oréal has launched the global Share & Care
programme with the objective of guaranteeing security,
protection and well-being for all of the Group's employees,
wherever they may be based around the world.

Share & Care aims at attracting and fostering the loyalty of
top-performing employees throughout the world, as has been
the case in France for a number of years.

1.3.1.7. A strategy of constant, sustainable,

shared growth

Supported by loyal shareholders, vigilant governance and
stable management, L'Oréal has always targeted constant,
sustainable growth


--- Page 4 ---

Since its very beginnings, the Group has been committed to
developing its presence in all regions of the world by applying
the fundamental rules of a good corporate citizen in each:

¢ the products offered to consumers meet the highest quality
standards;

the Group's social commitments are the same in alll its
subsidiaries;

¢ all production centres comply with the same rules aimed at
reducing their environmental footprint. Social audits are
carried out of suppliers’ factories and distribution centres;

¢ each subsidiary participates, as far as its resources allow, in
the major corporate philanthropy programmes run by the
L’'Oréal Foundation such as For Women In Science,
Hairdressers against AIDS and Beauty for a Better Life.

Above and beyond its solid long-term economic
performances, the Company seeks to be exemplary and sets
itself demanding standards in order to limit its footprint on the
planet. In October 2013, L’Oréal launched its new commitment
to sustainability by 2020: Sharing Beauty With All. This
programme addresses all of the Group’s impacts in the
following four areas: innovating sustainably, producing
sustainably, living sustainably and developing sustainably
(details of the commitments are set out in chapter 3)

1.3.1.8. A group that constantly adapts

L'Oréal relies on strong strategic continuity. But continuity does
not prevent renewal. L’Oréal evolves to adapt to changes in
the world in order to consolidate its leadership and increase its
chances of success going forward. The challenge is twofold: to
pursue the strategy which has enabled L’Oréal to be
successful over the last century and at the same time to invent
the new L'Oréal of the 21" century, perfectly matched and
attuned to a profoundly changing world.

1.3.2. AN ORGANISATION THAT SERVES
THE GROUP’S DEVELOPMENT

1.3.2.1. L'Oréal S.A.

U'Oréal S.A. is a French company with its registered office in
France, which carries out a commercial business specific to
that country. In parallel, L’Oréal S.A. acts as a holding
company and has a role firstly of strategic coordination and
secondly of scientific, industrial and marketing coordination for
the L'Oréal Group on a global basis. The subsidiaries develop
the Group's business activities in the country or region in which
they are located. In this respect, they manufacture - or have
manufactured - and commercialise the products that they
decide to sell on their market.

Almost all of the subsidiaries are owned by L’Oréal $.A., which
has a holding or control percentage equal or close to 100%.

The detailed list of these subsidiaries is set out in the notes to
the consolidated and parent company financial statements.

Presentation of the Group
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS

1.3.2.2. Cosmetics Divisions

The Cosmetics Divisions represented over 96% of consolidated
sales in 2015. They are organised into four operating Divisions
present in every zone and in every country, each of which
corresponds to a specific marketing channel. Against this
backdrop, each Division fully integrates all the opportunities
arising from increased digitalisation.

@ The Professional Products Division: Offering the best of
professional beauty

In all its historical businesses (haircare, hair colours, styling and
shaping), the Division has built a unique brand portfolio
including luxury hair care (Kérastase, Shu Uemura Art of Hair),
mainstream premium brands (L'Oréal Professionnel, Redken),
an affordable professional brand (Matrix), and a handful of
specialist brands (Decléor and Carita, Pureology).

To further strengthen its brand leadership, develop markets,
and accelerate the conquest of new professional hair salons,
the strategy is organised:

* by region: accelerating growth in the New Markets
(promotion of the profession through education,
development of a customised offering of both products
and services, development of complementary
distrioution channels), revitalising growth in mature
countries by making the hair salon experience more
engaging (salon e-motion concept, exclusive new
professional services, development of expert fashion
assistance provided by hairdressers);

* by category: enlarging its professional expertise to two
new segments (nail care and colour, Decléor and Carita
skincare): these new activities, which are highly
complementary to the hairdressing profession, will
enable the Division to enhance its influence over the
professional beauty business as a whole, in hair salons
and beauty institutes.

« The Consumer Products Division: Innovative cosmetics
affordable for all

The Consumer Products Division has built its development
around the deployment of its three main global brands (L'Oréal
Paris, Garnier, Maybelline), supported by several specialist or
regional brands (Magic, Essie, Dark and Lovely, Nice & Lovely,
Vogue and LaSCAD brands: Dop, Narta, Mixa, etc.).

With the aim of accelerating its growth, the Consumer
Products Division rolls out its strategy:

* by region: defending and expanding its already strong
positions in Western Europe, pursuing the winning
momentum in North America, speeding up growth in the
New Markets;

* by category: accentuating its development and
leadership in skin care, hair care, make-up and hair
colours, fo achieve the necessary critical mass in every
location where the Division is present, and developing
the categories that will drive growth going forward
(men’s cosmetics, deodorants).

¢ L'Oréal Luxe: Creating exceptional experiences

L’Oréal Luxe operates in a large number of countries a unique
portfolio of 17 prestigious brands, including iconic mainstream
brands, aspirational designer brands and alternative or
specialist brands. L’Oréal Luxe’s strategy revolves around a
vision organised

* by region: accelerating growth in the New Markets and
in Travel Retail - the leading growth drivers for L’Oréal
Luxe, consolidating leadership in Western Europe,
bolstering positions in the United States, and developing
new growth areas (Russia, Middle East);

* by category: developing skin care with three
multicategory brands and four specialist brands,
developing make-up particularly with the global
deployment of the specialist Uroan Decay brand and
perfumes, by winning major positions in women’s
perfumes and consolidating its leadership in men’s
fragrances.

¢@ The Active Cosmetics Division: Helping everyone in their
quest for healthy and beautiful skin

Thanks to its portfolio of highly complementary brands strongly
anchored in science and enjoying close links with healthcare
professionals all over the world, the Active Cosmetics Division is
a leader in dermocosmetics.

The Division is ideally placed to respond to growing consumer
demand for advice, efficacy and safety with its global brands
Vichy, La Roche-Posay, and SkinCeuticals.

The Division implements its strategy by adapting its business
model to the realities and opportunities of healthcare
channels in each of the major regions:

* pharmacies and chemists in Western Europe;
* drugstores in North America and in the New Markets;

* personalised advice to consumers on all markets.

| 10 | REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / L’OREAL 2015

The Selective Divisions (L'Oréal Luxe, Active Cosmetics,
Professional Products, The Body Shop) were created in 2013 in
order to accelerate the Group's development in all these
distribution channels by harnessing its expertise in each of its
selective sales networks.

Travel retail is a fast-growing channel that conveys an image.
Already the leader in travel retail, the Group decided to create
the Travel Retail Worldwide Division, including multi-division
activities. This Division's ambition is to continue to develop
travel retail supported by a “global shopper” strategy based
on a bespoke approach tailored according to language,
culture and beauty rituals, enabling the Group to respond to
the aspirations of this new generation of travellers.

The Body Shop

Founded in 1976 in Great Britain by Dame Anita Roddick, The
Body Shop Branch represented nearly 4% of consolidated sales
in 2015. The mission of this strongly committed brand is to have
a positive impact on the lives of men and women of all origins.
A growing number of consumers across the globe are on the
look-out for products that combine efficacy with a natural
inspiration, and this is proposed by brands with an
ethics-based business model. The Body Shop’s deployment
strategy combines:

pioneering, innovative products based on the highest
quality natural ingredients;

 astrong voice in its communications;
 apersonalised purchasing experience in stores or online.

On the New Markets where the brand has a_ particular
resonance, its range of naturally inspired products represents
a tremendous opportunity for development in markets in tune
with its vision of beauty, its sensorial products and its values.

1.4.

1.4.1. A HISTORICAL PRESENCE

IN DEVELOPED MARKETS

L'Oréal is present in 140 countries on all five continents.
Founded in France in 1909, the Group developed rapidly in
Western Europe. In 2015, this historical market for the Group
accounted for over 33% of its cosmetics sales.

In the first half of the 20" century, L’Oréal gained a foothold in
North America. Initially, the Group entrusted distribution
companies with commercializing its products, these
companies being united in 1953 around an exclusive agent,
Cosmair. Following Cosmair's takeover in 1994, the Group
developed in North America with the status of a subsidiary. The
acquisition of brands such as Maybelline (1996), Matrix and
Kiehl's (2000), or more recently Urban Decay (2012) and NYX
Cosmetics (2014) have firmly anchored the Group in North
America. In 2015, its sales on that continent increased by 3.5%
like-for-like and represented 27.4% of world cosmetic sales.

1.4.2. RAPID DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE

WESTERN EUROPE AND NORTH
AMERICA

Beginning in the 1970s, the Latin America Zone developed with
a multi-divisional organisation that the Group has adopted in
the other major regions of the world.

Present in Japan for nearly 50 years, L’Oréal has expanded its
presence in the country by choosing the brands to be given
priority for this extremely specific market: Kérastase in hair
salons, Lancéme in Luxury products and Maybelline and
L’Oréal Paris in mass-market products.

The 1990s witnessed the opening up of New Markets with the
fall of the Berlin Wall, giving the brands access to markets in
Eastern European countries.

L'Oréal was among the first foreign groups to obtain an
authorisation from the Indian government in 1994 to create a
wholly-owned subsidiary with its registered office in Mumbai.

In 1997, the Group created a large multi-divisional zone in Asia
and opened new subsidiaries, particularly in China where
L’Oréal holds all of the capital of its entity.

The Africa, Middle East Zone, where the Group lacked a strong
presence, is a new frontier for development in the New
Markets, with attractive growth potential.

Presentation of the Group
INTERNATIONALIZATION AND THE COSMETICS MARKET

INTERNATIONALIZATION AND THE COSMETICS MARKET

The mid 2000s were a turning point, with a sharp acceleration
in growth of the New Markets leading to a shift in the
economic world’s centre of gravity.

In all, the percentage of cosmetics sales generated by the
Group in the New Markets was 15.5% in 1995, 27.1% in 2006
and 39.5% in 2015. Sales in New Markets as a proportion of the
Group's total sales increased by nearly 60% between 2005 and
2015 and this trend is expected to continue.

The Group has a well-balanced geographical footprint across
most of the world’s main markets.

In autumn 2013, the Group unveiled its Sharing Beauty With All
programme and detailed its commitments for 2020 in terms of
reducing its environmental impact while confirming its growth
ambitions (these commitments are presented in more detail in
chapter 3).

1.4.3. HUGE DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL

Besides the major New Market countries, L'Oréal has notably
identified the following countries as “growth markets": Poland,
Ukraine, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia, Indonesia, Thailand,
Philippines, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and South Africa

In some of these countries, the consumption of cosmetics
products per inhabitant is 10 to 20 times lower than in mature
countries. Every year across the globe, several tens of millions
of people gain access to income levels that make them part of
the “middle classes”, enabling them to afford modern
cosmetics products.

The marketing teams are attuned to these new consumers,
particularly in large countries, and the laboratories on all
continents study the specific characteristics of those
consumers. The Group’s innovation policy is based on the
accessibility and adaptation of products to the beauty habits
and rituals of all men and women in their infinite diversity.
These form the basis for the universalisation of beauty.

The worldwide cosmetics market is worth approximately
€203 billion, and grew by an estimated +3.9% © in 2015. It is a
particularly robust market which is steadily expanding while
proving very resilient in times of economic challenges. The
cosmetics consumer always looks for quality and novelty
value, and puts a premium on leading-edge technology,
trends and new ideas. The cosmetics market remains a
supply-led market driven by innovation, where consumers are
always on the look-out for quality, performance and perceived
results.

From a geographic viewpoint, the New Markets continue to
spearhead growth in beauty, accounting for 70% of worldwide
market growth. The pace of growth has slowed slightly, at
+4.9%, due mainly to a more difficult situation in Brazil.
Asia-Pacific, the world’s biggest cosmetics market, remains
robust, posting +4.3% growth on the back of an acceleration in
South Asia markets which offset the slight slowdown in China.

Growth in mature markets picked up pace at +2.7%: the
recovery was confirmed in the US, while Western Europe saw
improved performances both north and south of the region
buoyed by the selective market.

and polls obtained from specialised organisations and companies, or,
in the absence of comprehensive studies, are the result of estimates

KEY FIGURES AND COMMENTS

ON THE 2015 FINANCIAL YEAR*

In a year marked by a worldwide economic slowdown and
increased international volatility, L'Oréal achieved strong
growth in 2015, supported by a positive monetary effect,
and outperformed the market in three of its four Divisions.

The Active Cosmetics Division has once again
demonstrated its great momentum all over the world, and
is strengthening its leadership in a dynamic
dermocosmetics market. L'Oréal Luxe delivered another
year of robust growth, driven by the strength of its brand
portfolio and its cutting-edge innovations. The Professional
Products Division is reaping the benefits of its initiatives to
stimulate the professional beauty market, and continues to
improve steadily. Finally, the Consumer Products Division
did not outperform its market, but improved in the second
half, thanks especially to the powerful acceleration in the
make-up category.

Across the geographic zones, L'Oréal has _ further
accentuated its leadership in Europe, and significantly
strengthened its performance in North America through the
course of the year. Trends in the New Markets were more
contrasted, in a context that was challenging in some
countries, such as Brazil and Russia.

New Markets

@ Asia, Pacific: Sales grew by +4.7% like-for-like and +19.7%
based on reported figures. Despite a difficult market in
Hong Kong, growth at L’Oréal Luxe improved in the fourth
quarter, driven by excellent performances in Japan. Yves
Saint Laurent, Kiehl's, Giorgio Armani and Urban Decay
have made strong contributions to the Division's success.
The Consumer Products Division is benefiting from good
performances in India, Australia and Thailand, and from
L’Oréal Paris, particularly in China. Magic is in a transitional
phase. The Active Cosmetics Division is posting strong
growth, driven by La Roche-Posay.

@ Latin America: Sales grew by +4.6% like-for-like and +0.9%
based on reported figures, thanks to double-digit growth in
the Active Cosmetics Division and at L'Oréal Luxe. The very
good performances of SkinCeuticals, Vichy, La
Roche-Posay, Lancéme and Kiehl's are especially worth
noting. If Brazil is excluded, Latin America achieved
double-digit like-for-like growth. The environment in Brazil is
continuing to hold back the Zone’s overall sales.

« Eastern Europe: The Zone posted figures of +9.8% like-for-like
and -3.5% based on reported figures. The Consumer
Products and Professional Products Divisions, and L'Oréal
Luxe, all recorded double-digit growth, driven by Russia,
Turkey and Ukraine. All Divisions are making significant
market share gains, particularly the Consumer Products
Division in all categories (haircare, hair colour, skincare and
deodorants), and the Maybelline brand, boosted by the
launch of Lash Sensational mascara, recorded the
strongest growth increase of the Division.

* Africa, Middle East: Sales growth amounted to +12.1%
like-forlike and +28.1% based on reported figures. Growth
was particularly fast in Egypt, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,
where it topped 20%. South Africa remains solid. In a
context of recent slowdown in several countries, the
Garnier, L’'Oréal Paris, Maybelline, Giorgio Armani, Yves
Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren, Kérastase, Vichy and La
Roche-Posay brands recorded double-digit growth. All the
Divisions are making progress, with market share gains in
their respective channels.

The Body Shop

The Body Shop recorded -0.9% like-for-like and +10.7% based
on reported figures, with good momentum in Africa, Middle
East and in Europe, notably in the United Kingdom, its home
market. The strategy of focusing on skincare is paying off in all
markets, with a strong contribution from the new Oils of Life
range. However, some Asian markets have been subject to a
challenging environment, particularly Hong Kong, and sales in
the year-end holidays were below expectation in North
America.

since the beginning of 2016

No significant event has occurred between the beginning of
the 2016 financial year and the meeting of the Board of
Directors finalizing the consolidated financial statements
ended December 31, 2015.

1.5.3.3. Prospects

In a volatile and uncertain economic environment, particularly
in some emerging countries, the Group can rely on its
balanced footprint across beauty categories, distribution
channels and geographic zones.

L'Oréal is entering 2016 with the ambition to outperform the
cosmetics market and achieve another year of sales and profit
growth

1.6. RESEARCH & INNOVATION: EXCELLENCE STEP-BY-STEP

RESEARCH: PART OF THE GROUP’S
DNA

Over a century ago, a chemist called Eugéne Schueller
founded L'Oréal thanks to a major innovation: harmless hair
dye. Research was therefore already written in the Group’s
genes and quickly became one of the keys to its success. To
invent beauty and accommodate the aspirations of millions of
men and women, L’Oréal continues to push back the
boundaries of science. This commitment to innovation remains
unwavering: to offer everyone, everywhere in the world, the
best of cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy and safety. The
Group's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) focuses are a
source of new innovation opportunities rather than a mere set
of constraints.

1.6.1.

To win over one billion new consumers, the Group constantly
increases its investments, and had a budget of €794 million in
2015.

The Scientific Advisory Board continues its work

Created in 2013 to explore the future boundaries of beauty
and chaired by Jacques Leclaire, Global Scientific Director,
this year the Scientific Advisory Board looked at sustainable
innovation.

After their recommendation in 2014 to undertake in-depth
studies on ageing, the Board’s experts expressed their
deep-rooted belief that future cosmetics can significantly
benefit from the sustainable resources that result from green
chemistry (see also chapter 3, “Innovating responsibly”). This
path, along which the Group’s teams have already covered
quite a distance, could result in even more exciting
innovations in the short term. Over the longer term, the Board’s
experts have identified synthetic biology as a highly promising
avenue for cosmetic treatment in the future.

1.6.2. A PERTINENT MULTI-HUB
ORGANISATION

The international organisation implemented by the Group
around six hubs is beginning to bear fruit. Thanks to their close
proximity to consumers, these hubs innovate with genuine
local relevance and nourish the flow of innovations.

In order to ensure a successful transition from a largely
centralised system to a multi-hub organisation, the roles and
responsibilities in each of the main functions have been
clarified. The international dimension is reinforced through
global management of the project portfolio.

1.6.3. BALANCING ETHICS AND

INNOVATION

To respond to the essential requirements of product safety, in
the 1980s the research team began to develop alternative
methods which did not use animal testing in order to assess
the safety of its products and active principles. Major progress
was made thanks to tissue engineering, with the reconstruction
of the first human epidermis in 1979 and the first complete skin
(epidermis and dermis) in 1996.

The Group has acquired extensive expertise in this field owing
to four decades of international scientific co-operation. A total
of 12 reconstructed skin and corneal tissue models have now
been developed, while five alternatives to animal testing have
been approved.

These models are fabulous tools for predicting product safety
and efficacy and for reducing time-to-market. Thanks to these
models, L'Oréal was able to stop testing finished products on
animals in 1989 and to develop predictive evaluation
strategies to meet European regulations prohibiting the
offering for sale of products containing any ingredient that has
been tested on animals after March 11", 2013. This law has not
had any impact on the Group's innovation efforts.

To protect its lead in skin engineering, L'Oréal evaluates
cutting-edge technologies such as microfluidic systems and
“organs-on-a-chip”. It has signed a partnership with Californian
start-up Organovo which specialises in three-dimensional
bioprinting, a technique which allows it fo build 3D human
tissue layer-by-layer by generating multi-cellular building blocks
(bio-ink).

Validation and predictive evaluation

In its unrelenting quest for progress in testing for safety without
using animals, L’Oréal continues fo participate in the
validation of new alternative methods, such as to treat eye
irritation and sensitivity in Europe and eye irritation and
corrosion in Japan, and the pre-validation of alternative
methods such as for treating skin irritation on a Chinese Episkin
model in China.

Episkin continues to develop

The Group’s ethical commitment led to the creation of Episkin,
a subsidiary in Lyon which produces and sells validated skin
models. This commitment took on an international dimension
in response to legal and regulatory changes such as those in
Brazil, India and China. For example, reconstructed skin of
Asian origin manufactured locally will be marketed and sold
by Shanghai Episkin Biotechnology Co.Ltd and users will be
taught about the new technique in training sessions delivered
by the Episkin Academy in China.

1.6.4. RESEARCH FURTHERS KNOWLEDGE

Key role of long UVAs in sun protection

Among the sun’s rays to which our skin is exposed every day,
long UVA rays account for almost 80% of total UVs and
profoundly alter the dermis. They are more abundant and
have a greater penetration range than other UVs and yet their
biological impact has long been underestimated because of
their lower energy as compared to UVB or short UVA rays.
Today, we know the effects long UVAs have over time on
premature aging of the skin and recent studies have
emphasised their role in skin cancer and involvement in
sun-induced immuno-suppression.

L'Oréal’s_ researchers have meticulously identified the
biological effects of long UVA rays, which put real stress on
both the epidermis and dermis. In particular, the researchers
based their work on “omics” studies to show the impact of long
UVAs on the skin’s deepest layers. Their work proves the
importance of sun protection better addressing long UVAs and
repairing damage through antioxidants.

The ravages of pollution

More than a decade ago, L'Oréal began scientific studies
looking at the impact of the environment on the skin's health.
Clinical studies run in Mexico and China have clearly shown
the impacts of pollution on the skin, including increased
sebum secretion and modified sebum composition,
oxidation-induced skin disorders and ultimately — skin
hypersensitivity. Based on clinical research results, laboratories
have revealed that this oxidation can cause severe skin
problems, deepen wrinkles, and impair the skin barrier. Air
pollution could be a potent catalyst for these effects and
almost triple the oxidative stress caused by UVs.

In response, L'Oréal has devised a triple protection solution:
"Purify, Repair and Protect". Group brands such as La
Roche-Posay, Clarisonic, Shu Uemura, Yue-Sai, L'Oréal Paris
and Maybelline offer an array of products to help consumers
better protect their beauty from pollution.

Silanes make their entrance in cosmetics

Born of a glass industry technology transfer, sol-gel technology
is a chemical process capable of transforming certain
materials from a liquid to a solid, gellike state. Thanks to the
work of L'Oréal’s chemical specialists on the family of silanes
produced from solgels, this process proved an innovative
solution to treat fine, damaged hair, by creating a supple yet
resistant molecular network within the hair fibre to redensify
and strengthen it. Combined with a cationic polymer, its
long-lasting action is particularly effective on damaged hair.
The Professional Products Division has successful introduced
the technology to its range of products.

1.6.5. QUINOA CONTAINS A NEW
INGREDIENT FOR GREEN
CHEMISTRY

L'Oréal's researchers have discovered a new gentle exfoliating
active principle in quinoa husk, which protects the quinoa
grain. Quinoa husk not only contains saponins and
polyphenols which make it very interesting for skin care, but,
obtained through an eco-friendly process, it is a renewable
resource and has a positive environmental profile which make
it a new active principle in the Group's green chemistry. This
has given rise to an original responsible procurement
programme (Solidarity Sourcing - see section 1.7.3 herebelow)
and to the development by chemists of a green

To meet consumers’ needs, the Operations Division rolls out its
expertise in its three core areas of responsibility: quality (brand
protection), safety (protection of Human Resources and
assets) and Sustainable Development (environmental
protection) within the context of the Group’s Sharing Beauty

The Operations Division manages three major fundamental
responsibilities for L'Oréal throughout the world.

1.7.2.1. Protection of Human Resources and

assets

The Operations Division guarantees the right for each L’Oréal
Group employee to work in a safe environment.

The Group’s duty is to guarantee the best conditions in terms
of health and safety at work for all its employees. Exhaustive
programmes have been implemented to reduce risks and
ensure ongoing improvement.

robust and can be applied on an industrial scale by Chimex,
the Group's molecular industrial production centre.

1.6.6. CONNECTED BEAUTY

The digital revolution is starting to profoundly change how
beauty products are consumed. This is why the multi-skilled
teams of the Connected Beauty Incubator are stepping up
their collaboration with centres of excellence in biology,
biophysics or biotechnology so that they take on board the
latest technological advances, the power of data and new
consumption patterns. At the June 2015 World Congress of
Dermatology in Vancouver, they used MC10 to show the
relevance of stretchable electronics for beauty applications
and unveiled the first results of their collaborative work
culminating in the launch of My UV Patch, a sun protection
solution.

A managerial safety culture, a safety system and audits to
monitor procedures have been rolled out for several years on
all the Group's sites, including administrative sites, research
and innovation centres, factories and distribution centres. The
culture defines high standards and involves staff at all levels.

Thanks to its powerful systems and ongoing improvement in its
results, the Group is today one of the world’s top performers in
terms of safety.

1.7.2.2. Protection of quality

The excellence of its quality management across the value
chain (from design and sourcing through to production and
distribution) is world-famous and enables L’Oréal’s brands to
offer consumers high-quality products and _— superior
performance. This demanding quality system mainly aims to
guarantee product integrity with the same standard of quality
all over the world, while complying with local regulations.

1.7.3. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION ACROSS
THE VALUE CHAIN

1.7.3.1. Design

Contributing to innovation

The Operations Division plays a major role in helping the
brands to differentiate their products for consumers.

In terms of product innovation, the responsibility of the
Operations Division is mainly exercised in the areas of
packaging and development, design, and processes. In 2015,
L'Oréal filed 90 patents for packaging and processes.

To accelerate the innovation process, a host of initiatives exist
promoting exchanges and meetings between the Group and
its suppliers. Cherrypack, a global in-house trade fair
dedicated to innovation, was created to enable suppliers to
present on an exclusive basis their latest innovations with
regard to finished product packaging and Point-of-Sale (POS)
advertising to all of the Group's brands and to research and
innovation teams. Other multiannual events include
Marketplace, days dedicated to packaging innovations
organised by Division, cosmetics category or geographic zone

1.7.3.2. Sourcing

360° management of supplier performance

L'Oréal’s success can also be accounted for by the Group’s
exacting standards in the choice of its suppliers and the
longstanding relationships forged with those suppliers.

L'Oréal's strategic suppliers are regularly assessed using a
scorecard tracking five equally important areas of
performance: innovation, quality, competitiveness, supply
chain and Corporate Social Responsibility including
sustainability. Each of these areas is broken down into a series
of specific indicators which have been formally laid down in
order to make it easier to rate them and give guidance.

Presentation of the Group
OPERATIONS

Forging durable links with suppliers entails the development of
local sourcing in fast-growing zones. Since 2010, the Group has
implemented the wall-to-wall programme, whereby a
packaging production facility operated by a supplier is set up
within the Group’s own factories. This partnership develops
responsiveness and industrial flexibility, while reducing the
transportation of packaging items and the generation of the
related waste. It is aimed at plants with highly specialised
technologies that produce very large volumes and have
ongoing needs for external resources, such as the Rambouillet
factory in France, the Settimo Torinese factory in Italy, the
Istanbul facility in Turkey or the SGo Paulo factory in Brazil,
which source their plastic bottles in this manner.

A strong commitment to social responsibility

The Operations Division plays a crucial role in the field of social
responsibility and actively participates in the Sharing Beauty
With All programme. L’Oréal encourages its suppliers to step
up their Sustainable Development practices and rigorously
monitors their commitments through a large number of social
audits conducted throughout the world. A total of 7,080 social
audits have been carried out since 2006, including 951 in
2015. The aim of these audits is to provide suppliers with
support in improving their safety standards and _ their
environmental and social performance (see chapter 3).

In launching Solidarity Sourcing in 2010, a highly original
programme that is unique on the market, the Group took the
initiative of using the Purchasing function as a driver of social
inclusion. Solidarity Sourcing involves making certain purchases
from local suppliers who make commitments in favour of
minorities, disabled workers or workers from underprivileged
backgrounds. It may also involve very small suppliers or fair
trade players that L’Oréal calls on to contribute through its
suppliers. In 2015, the Solidarity Sourcing programme provided
access to employment for over 57,200 people in vulnerable
situations all over the world, as compared to 27,000 people in
2014. L'Oréal wishes to expand this approach to include its
suppliers’ suppliers and this new initiative aimed at
encouraging the Group’s suppliers in turn fo use the approach
for their own suppliers was officially launched in 2012.

1.7.3.3. Production

Regionalised production

L'Oréal's 44 factories are located in order to supply all the
countries in which the Group is present. The strategy is to
produce locally in order to meet the needs of local and regional
consumers. To support the drive to win over another one billion
consumers, notably in the New Markets, the Group has, for
example, production sites in Egypt, Kenya, China, Indonesia as
well as India, which have resulted from the construction of new
facilities or from the integration of acquired companies.

(1) Strategic suppliers are suppliers who bring significant value added to the Group by contributing, through their weight, innovations, strategic alignment

and geographical deployment, to L'Oréal's strategy on a durable basis.

| 44 FACTORIES WORLDWIDE

Factory specialisation

Factories generally cover the production requirements of one
Operational Division, are specialised in a given major industrial
technology and are located close to the markets that they
serve. The rotation of brands on the packaging lines is also
assisted by the increased standardisation of industrial
processes. This industrial model helps to improve output,
quality and safety management performance year after year.

Cost and quality management

Quality has improved across the entire cycle, from design and
production through to distribution. This resulted in a sharp drop
in customer claims in 2015, which stood at 51 per one million
products.

In 2015, the System of Operational Excellence continued to be
rolled out in all factories. This continuous improvement process
is based on the close involvement of employees in a number
of areas such as safety, environmental impact, ergonomics
and production quality and capacity at industrial sites, while
at the same time reducing costs.

L’Oréal has set itself the goal of continually improving its
economic performance. In 2015, it focused particularly on
managing and reducing material losses and on reducing
washing water used in the factories (this fell by 18% in the

year). Besides economic gains, these cutbacks reinforce the
factories’ commitment to Sustainable Development in terms of
reducing water consumption and waste generation.

Environmental protection at the heart of production

In the field of sustainable production, the Group’s
environmental policy looks to roll out best practices with
regard to energy efficiency, efficient resource consumption
and waste reduction, and the best possible waste treatment,
as well as to implement breakthrough projects in an ongoing
quest for operational efficiency combined with environmental
performance. In 2015, the Operations Division once again
showed its ability to decouple growth in production (up +26%)
from the consumption of resources (CO, emissions down 56%
and water consumption down 45% since 2005).

Through the Commitments for 2020 made under the Sharing
Beauty With All programme, the Group continues to pursue the
approach initiated in 2009 aimed at reducing the
environmental footprint of its factories and distribution centres.
The pledge to slash its CO, emissions in absolute terms (both
direct and indirect), water consumption and waste generation
per finished product (FP) by 50% by 2015 from a 2005 baseline
is now a pledge for a 60% reduction by 2020 (see chapter 3).
Furthermore, the environmental impacts related to packaging
and transportation are also taken into consideration


--- Page 32 ---

In many of the Group's sites, initiatives are in place to choose
the alternative energy sources that are best suited to the local
ecosystem, such as geothermal energy in Vichy in France,
photovoltaic panels in Mexico, biomethanation in Belgium,
phytorestoration in Mourenx in France, a biomass facility in
Burgos in Spain, and hydraulic power in Yichang, China.

Nine Operations Division sites were carbon neutral in 2015: 5
factories (Libramont in Belgium, Settimo Torinese in Italy,
Burgos in Spain, Rambouillet in France and Yichang in China)
and 4 distribution facilities (Cranbury and Brunswick in the
United States, a facility in Mexico and another in Australia).

In 2015, L'Oréal obtained very high Carbon Disclosure Project
(CDP) scores for performance (A) and _ information
transparency (99) (versus A and 98, respectively, in 2014) and
was recognised as a leading player in the fight against climate
change. Chapter 3 provides more details of these scores.

1.7.3.4 Logistics

L'Oréal’s supply chain covers all information flows and physical
flows in the value chain, from the supplier to the point of sale. It
ensures that the right product is delivered at the right time in
accordance with the expectations of its distributor customers
while controlling costs. In 2015, L’Oréal’s supply chain
achieved a record global service level in all channels, which
now include a growing proportion of deep trade outside the
traditional channels and points of sale, particularly in the New
Markets, and e-commerce. The 2015 ranking published by
Gartner, an independent company evaluation specialist,
applauded L’Oréal for placing its supply chain at the heart of
its business and increasing its proximity to its distributor
customers: L’Oréal’s supply chain was ranked among the Top
5 supply chains in Europe and moved up four places in the
world ranking.

Presentation of the Group
OPERATIONS

Over the past few years, the L'Oréal Group has invested
significantly in upgrading its supply chain information systems
in order to synchronise all stages of the supply chain and
adjust production to fit market needs as closely as possible.
Further, in order to improve the quality of its sales forecasts, a
key issue for its commercial entities, the Operations Division
launched an integrated information system which is being
gradually rolled out worldwide. In 2015, it was rolled out to
Brazil and to countries in Africa and the Middle East and now
covers 60% of L'Oréal’s 2015 sales.

The geographical location of the distribution centres enables
L’Oréal to be as close as possible to the 515,000 direct delivery
points of the Group or its distributor customers. The
modernisation of tools and practices in these distribution
centres, for example as part of projects run in 2015 to
automate preparative tools in the United States, Australia and
Germany, and the permanent synchronisation between our
distribution network and changing customer needs in each
country and distribution channel, make it possible to adjust
our physical distribution network on an ongoing basis in order
to increase our agility.

1.7.4. GLOBAL ECONOMIC
PERFORMANCE AT THE SERVICE
OF THE BRANDS AND THE
COMMERCIAL ENTITIES

The Operations Division has major economic responsibility for
the brands and markets and this has an impact on total
product costs.

The Division's economic optimisation efforts involve tracking
the total landed cost, i.e., the final full cost of a product, which
includes the cost of packaging and raw materials, the value
added by the factories and all supply chain costs up to the
final point of sale.

1.8. INVESTMENT POLICY

L'Oréal's investment policy responds to long-term objectives.

L’Oréal is an industrial company which develops chiefly
through two types of investment:

1. scientific investments and investments in equipment
which are explained at length in several sections of this
document (see in particular section 1.7. on page 34 and
section 1.6. on page 31);

2. marketing investments which are made on an ongoing
basis and are inherent to the Group's activities in the
cosmetics industry. To capture new market share, in-depth
research must be conducted all over the world, and
advertising and promotional expenses need to be
attuned to the familiarity of the brands and _ their
competitive position. Lastly, investments in point-of sale
(POS) advertising materials ensure optimal presence for
our brands in points of sale.

For reasons relating to strategy and competition, L'Oréal
cannot therefore provide any systematic information on future
investments

In 2015, the Group’s investments totalled €1,172 million, or 4.6%
of its sales, close its highest levels. This trend reflects the

Investment commitments in 2015 can be broken down as
follows:

¢ production and the supply chain represent approximately
27% of total investments;

marketing investments, including moulds, POS advertising
materials and stores account for 44%;

¢ IT investments spread over all these categories represent
17% of total investments.

The Group operates in a changing environment. Like any
company, it is necessarily exposed to risks which, if they were
to materialise, could have a negative impact on its business
activities, its financial situation and its assets, particularly in
terms of reputation and image.

This chapter presents the main risks to which the Group
considers that it is exposed, namely risks specific to its business
activities, followed by legal, industrial and environmental risks,
and finally risks of an economic and financial nature.

L’Oréal has set up an Internal Control system to prevent and
manage these risks more effectively. The Internal Control and
tisk management procedures are described in the chapter 2
as provided for by Article L. 225.37 of the French Commercial
Code.

We cannot however guarantee a wholly risk-free environment.
Furthermore, the Group could be adversely impacted by other
risks of which it is not currently aware or which it does not
consider material at the date of this Document.

The risks to which the Group considers it is exposed are
described below.

1.9.1. BUSINESS RISKS

1.9.1.1. Image and reputation

The Company's reputation and its brand image may be
compromised at any time in a globalised world where
information is disseminated rapidly. No company is safe from
an undesirable event, whether this involves the use or misuse
of a product or reprehensible individual conduct. Circulation
of detrimental information in the media, regardless of whether
or not such information is founded, has been facilitated by the
introduction of new technologies and the development of
social networks, and could also affect the Company's
reputation and brand image.

In order to reduce the risks relating to events of this kind,
L’Oréal has set up a system which monitors English- and
French-language websites on an ongoing basis. The
subsidiaries deploy their own social media and web
monitoring system under the aegis of their Director of

Communications and report on monitoring to the Corporate
Communications Department. L'Oréal has also set up a crisis
management procedure which is tasked with preventing,
managing and limiting the consequences of undesirable
events on the Company across the globe. The Group crisis
management officer reports directly to General Management.
The deployment of the Code of Ethics throughout the Group
aims at reinforcing the dissemination of rules of good conduct
which form the basis of L'Oréal’s integrity and ethics. These
rules of good conduct seek to guide actions and behaviour,
inspire choices and make sure that the Group's values are
reflected in the everyday acts of each employee. L’Oréal has
also implemented a Code of Good Practice for the use of
social media by its employees.

1.9.1.2. Product quality and safety

Consumer safety is an absolute priority for L'Oréal: assessing
safety is at the heart of any new product development process
and a prerequisite before any new product can be launched
on the market. The principles governing the Group's quality
and safety policy are:

@ satisfaction of customer needs;
¢@ compliance with safety requirements and legislation;
product quality and conformity across the supply chain.

The Worldwide Safety Evaluation organisation specifically
evaluates the safety of raw materials and finished products. It
establishes the toxicological profile of the ingredients which
are used and the tolerance of the formulas before they are
launched on the market.

The same safety standards are applied worldwide to ensure
that consumers from across the globe have access to
products of identical quality.

L’Oréal goes one step further in safety assessments by
monitoring the potential adverse effects that may arise once
the product is on the market through its cosmeto-vigilance
network. This network compiles, validates and analyses any
adverse effects related to use of a product based on rigorous,
proven methodologies, allowing the appropriate corrective
measures to be taken where necessary (see chapter 3,
Cosmeto-vigilance and impact on safety assessmenf).

In terms of questions that civil society may ask regarding
certain substances and their effects on health and the
environment, three points summarise L’Oréal's position:

@ vigilance with regard to any new scientific data;
co-operation with the relevant authorities;

precaution leading to the substitution of ingredients in the
event of a proven risk or a strongly suspected risk.

The Group has also put in place insurance policies protecting
it against third party liability claims related to its products (see
section 1.9.8.2 Integrated worldwide programmes below). The
measures taken in favour of consumer health and safety are
described in further detail in chapter 3.

1.9.1.3. Responsible communication

L'Oréal provides consumers with innovative products whose
success is based on their quality and performance. The
benefits of these products are highlighted in the Group’s
communications. Despite all due care taken to guarantee the
accuracy and fairness of the claims made in these
communications, there is always a possibility that they may be
challenged by the authorities, organisations or consumers

In order to reduce the risk of any such challenges being made,
the International Product Communication Evaluation
Department ensures the conformity of — product
communications before they are put on the market. The
Group’s Code of Ethics sets out the fundamental principles of
responsible communication and L’Oréal has made a
commitment to implement the International Chamber of
Commerce Consolidated Code of Advertising and Marketing
Communication Practice and the Cosmetics Europe Charter
and Guiding Principles on responsible advertising and
marketing communication to which the key global cosmetics
industry players in Europe adhere.

1.9.1.4. Seasonal nature of business

In certain cases and for specific products, the timing of sales
can be linked to climate conditions, such as for example sun
care products. Products and brands sought after by
consumers as gifts see particularly strong sales at year-end
and during holiday periods. This is particularly the case for
fragrances and The Body Shop products. A major disruption in
any of these factors could affect L’Oréal’s sales.

L’Oréal endeavours to mitigate these risks through the diversity
and enrichment of its range of products and by organising
product launches and special product promotional events
throughout the entire year.

1.9.1.5. Geographic presence and economic

and political environment

U'Oréal has subsidiaries in 69 countries, with 66.9% of its sales
being generated outside Western Europe. Global growth in the
cosmetics market has led L’Oréal to develop its activities in
countries within the “New Markets” Zone, which represented
over 39.5% of its cosmetics sales in 2015. The breakdown of sales
and sales trends are set out in chapter 1 of this Document.

Besides the currency risks mentioned in note 10.1. in chapter 4,
Hedging of currency risk and in the Currency risk section
below, political or economic disturbances in countries where
the Group generates a significant portion of its sales could
have an impact on its business activities.

Presentation of the Group
RISK FACTORS*

However, its broad global presence helps to maintain a
balance in sales and enables results to be offset between
countries and geographic zones. In periods of major economic
slowdown or sovereign debt crises in certain countries, the
Group’s sales growth could however be affected.

1.9.1.6. Distribution network

To sell its products, L’'Oréal uses independent distribution
channels except for a limited number of stores which are
owned by the Company. The combination or disappearance
of distribution chains and changes in regulations with regard
to selective distribution could impact the development of the
Group's brands in the country or countries concerned.

The presence of the Group's brands in all types of distribution
networks helps mitigate any potential negative impact.

1.9.1.7. Competition

Due to its size and brand positioning, L'Oréal is subject to
constant pressure from local and international competitors
across the globe.

Competition is healthy: it drives the Group's teams around the
world to do their upmost to serve the interests of consumers
and the Group’s brands. Winning market share, improving
operating profitability and thereby ensuring growth are a
permanent challenge in a context where companies
constantly strive to obtain the best positions for their products
and launch the most attractive and effective product ranges
offering an optimal price/ quality ratio.

With a view to the roll-out of its “Universalisation” strategy, the
Group has rethought its innovation model! and is constantly
increasing its investments in research. L'Oréal’s research teams
innovate to respond to the infinite diversity of beauty
aspirations all over the world. Thanks to this ability to
implement long-ferm research programmes, L’Oréal can
maintain its lead over its competitors (see chapter 1.6. of this
document, Research & Innovation: Excellence step-by-step),

1.9.1.8. Innovation and consumer

expectations

The development of innovative products and their adaptation
to market requirements is an ongoing priority for the Group. If it
fails to anticipate or interpret changes in consumer
expectations and new trends, especially with regard to digital
solutions and connected tools, its sales could be affected.

The Consumer & Market Insights Department, part of the
Innovation Division, is constantly monitoring changes in
consumers’ cosmetic expectations by product category and
major regions of the world. Its work enables the Group’s
researchers to develop new products that are in step with
market needs, as discussed in paragraph Local research and
product adaption in section 1.6 of this Document.

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / L’OREAL 2015 | 41 |

| Presentation of the Group
RISK FACTORS*

The Digital Division is responsible for accelerating the Group's
digital transformation by helping the brands create enriched
spaces for expression and helping teams to establish more
interactive, close-knit and bespoke relationships with
consumers, while leveraging the opportunities for developing
business through digital media as a distribution channel.

Consumers’ expectations with regard to Sustainable
Development are also at the heart of the Sharing Beauty With
All programme unveiled in 2013 (see chapter 3).

1.9.1.9. External growth transactions

As part of its development strategy, L’Oréal has made, and
may have occasion to make acquisitions or sign licence
agreements.

However, implementation of this strategy depends on L'Oréal
identifying development opportunities at an acceptable cost
and under acceptable conditions.

The Group has put in place a monitoring process for such
transactions, which includes:

¢ setting up multidisciplinary teams to prepare projects and
due diligence work;

 areview by the Board of Directors’ Strategy and Sustainable
Development Committee and then by the Board of
Directors, of acquisition or equity investment opportunities
that represent significant amounts or fall outside the scope
of the Group’s usual business activities, and of the
conditions for their implementation.

These operations may have a negative impact on the Group’s
results if the Group fails to successfully integrate the activities of
the acquired companies and their personnel, products and
technologies under the expected conditions, or if it fails to
achieve the expected synergies or to successfully handle
liabilities not anticipated when the transaction was completed
and for which L’Oréal has little or no protection from the seller.

Board-approved acquisitions are regularly monitored by the
Board of Directors which is informed of the conditions for
integration and the progress made.

1.9.1.10. Risks related to Human Resources
management

One of the keys to L’Oréal's success lies in the talent of its staff.
If L'Oréal fails to identify, attract, retain and train competent
employees who behave responsibly, the development of its
activities and its results could be affected.

The Group therefore looks to create a motivating, engaging
professional environment which also encourages employees
to take on board the Group’s values, including those put
forward by the Code of Ethics. The launch of the international
Share & Care programme, which meets the essential needs of
each of the Group’s employees (in terms of social protection,

| 42 | REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / L’OREAL 2015

healthcare, parenthood and quality of life at work) helps the
Group to be more competitive and plays out its belief that
social and economic performance are not just closely related
but mutually reinforcing. L’Oréal’s Human Resources policy is
described in chapter 2 and in chapter 3.

1.9.1.11. Safety and security

The Group's presence at more than 400 sites (excluding own
stores and the point-of-sales outlets of our distributor
customers) exposes it to risks with regard to events stemming
for example from geopolitical tensions, malicious acts or
natural disasters. The consequences of these risks may
adversely affect the Group’s assets, namely people and
tangible and intangible assets.

In order to permanently protect these resources (or Group
assets) against malicious acts, the Security Department helps
in the preventive implementation of technical, HR and
operational procedures to limit the residual risk of malicious
damage and support the Group’s international development
in high-risk countries. It also provides employees travelling
abroad for business with a monthly report on travel risks.

As regards the occurrence of natural disasters, since 2010 the
Real Estate Department has deployed a global programme to
assess site vulnerability to seismic risk in the most exposed
areas. At the same time, the Information Systems Department
ensures that seismic risk is taken into consideration in the
IT continuity plans for the countries most at risk.

1.9.1.12. Information systems

The day-to-day management of activities such as purchasing,
production and distribution, invoicing, reporting and
consolidation, as well as internal data exchange and access,
relies on the proper functioning of all technical infrastructure
and IT applications.

As part of the ongoing development of information
technologies and their applications, the Group's business
activities, expertise and more generally its relations with all
stakeholders in its social and economic environment depend
on being able to function in a more virtual, digital
environment.

The risk of a malfunction/ breakdown in these systems or
misappropriation of confidential or personal data for
exogenous or endogenous reasons (including intrusions,
malicious acts, etc.) cannot be ruled out. To minimise the
impact that this type of occurrence could have, the
Information Systems Department has introduced strict rules
with regard to data back-up and protection, access to
confidential data and data security with regard to both
computer hardware and software applications. In order to
adapt to new communications technologies, L’Oréal has
introduced an Information and Communication Technologies
Charter. These measures are described in page 106 of
Chapter 2.


--- Page 38 ---

To address the growing threat of cybercrime, L’Oréal takes
continuous steps to strengthen the resources dedicated to
information system security. This plan relies in particular on
anti-intrusion equipment, an information system security audit
programme, protecting sensitive equipment and providing
global oversight for identifying irregularities (see also the
Report of the Chairman on Internal Control). L'Oréal’s
approach is part of an ongoing improvement process and its
safety focus is constantly adjusted in line with new cyber
threats. For example, the Group is increasingly investing in
systems for detecting and reacting to warnings and security
incidents and in the periodic oversight of the effectiveness of
such solutions

1.9.1.13. Risk of an Internal Control failure

L’Oréal has set up an Internal Control system which, however
effective it may be, can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance that the Company's objectives can be
achieved due to the inherent limitations of any control system.
Accordingly, the Group cannot rule out the risk of an Internal
Control failure that may expose it to an act of fraud in
particular.

A process designed to raise the awareness of fraud risk has
been rolled out to all the Management Committees of the
Group's subsidiaries (setting out the main operational
scenarios that could occur, the alert systems and the existing
procedures and controls) and helps reduce the Group’s
exposure to this risk. The Group has also published a
corruption prevention guide which rounds out the
commitments and principles set out in L'Oréal's Code of Ethics,
as described in chapter3, L'Oréal's Corporate social,
environmental and societal information.

1.9.2. LEGAL RISKS

1.9.2.1. Intellectual property: trademarks and

models

L’Oréal is the owner of key intangible assets on behalf of the
Group's companies to which it grants licences in exchange for
the payment of royalties. L'Oréal thereby owns most of its
brands, which are a strategic asset for the Group, particularly
the major international brands described in the Cosmetics
Divisions section. This does not include several brands for
which L’Oréal has obtained a license and most of which are
currently used by L'Oréal Luxe, primarily the Giorgio Armani,
Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren, Cacharel, Viktor&Rolf and
Diesel brands.

The trademark name, the products themselves and the
models may be infringed or counterfeited by economic
players wishing to illegally and illegitimately claim the benefits
of their reputation.

Special care is given to the protection of the trademarks and
models belonging to L'Oréal, and this responsibility is entrusted
to a special unit of the Group’s Legal Department, which has
responsibility for registering trademarks in all countries. This unit
also keeps a close watch on the market and takes the
necessary actions against infringers and counterfeiters.

The L'Oréal Group is also an active member of organisations
which have set themselves the goal of combating

Presentation of the Group
RISK FACTORS*

counterfeiting and promoting good commercial practices. In
particular these include the French Manufacturers’ association
(Union des Fabricants), the International Chamber of
Commerce and Business Europe.

Before any trademark and model is registered, searches are
conducted to identify any prior rights that may exist.

In light of the large number of countries in which its products
are sold and the multiple potential prior rights that may exist in
each of these countries, we cannot rule out the possibility that
third parties may claim prior rights to certain L’Oréal
trademarks and models.

This potential risk has to be cited in order to provide a
comprehensive risk account, even though the likelihood of it
occurring is low due to the care taken when conducting prior
rights searches.

1.9.2.2. Industrial property: patents

Research and innovation are the historic pillars of L’Oréal’s
development. The dedication of L’Oréal’s research teams has
made it one of the leading industrial patent filers in its field for
many years now.

In order to protect the Group against the risk of another
company claiming one of its molecules, a production process
or packaging, L’Oréal has set up the International Industrial
Property Department, part of the Research and Innovation
Division. This specific department is responsible for filing the
Group's patents, exploiting them and defending them on a
worldwide basis. However, one cannot exclude that third parties
could contest the validity of certain patents held by the Group.

1.9.2.3. Regulatory changes

L’Oréal is subject to the laws which apply to all companies and
it requires its subsidiaries to comply with the regulations of the
countries in which it operates.

The European REACH regulations (Registration, Evaluation and
Authorisation of Chemicals) that came into force in June 2007
are aimed at increasing human and environmental safety of
chemicals by requiring all user companies to prove that they
have implemented appropriate risk management measures.
L’Oréal plays an active role in this process for the substances
manufactured or imported by its European legal entities
concerned. Within the framework of national and European
associations, L’Oréal helps analyse and draft practical guides
for the implementation of these regulations.

L'Oréal is also subject in Europe to the 7" amendment to the
European Cosmetics Directive on animal testing of cosmetic
ingredients. An action plan has been drawn up at L’Oréal in
order to improve the design and methods used to assess the
safety of raw materials. This plan is being implemented on an
accelerated basis in order to prepare as effectively as possible
for the application of these regulations. L’Oréal was able to
stop testing finished products on animals in 1989 (14 years
before it became a legal obligation in Europe) and develop
predictive evaluation strategies to meet European regulations
which prohibit the offering for sale of products containing any
ingredient that has been tested on animals after
March 11", 2013 (see the Balancing ethics and innovation
section in 1.6.3).

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / L’OREAL 2015 | 43 |

| Presentation of the Group
RISK FACTORS*

Certain countries are subject fo export restrictions, embargoes,
economic sanctions or other trade restrictions levied by the US,
the European Union or other countries or organisations.

As an active member of professional associations in the
countries in which its industry is represented, L’Oréal is involved
in an ongoing dialogue with national or regional authorities in
charge of specifically regulating products in its industrial sector
in order to anticipate or manage any risks that may arise from
changes in the regulatory landscape.

1.9.2.4.

In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is involved in
legal actions and is subject to tax assessments, customs
controls and administrative audits. It is also the subject of
proceedings initiated by national competition authorities, in
particular in European countries (see note 12.2. of the
Consolidated financial statements in chapter 4).

Other legal risks and litigation

In order to better prevent these risks, the Group's Legal
Department has introduced a training session on competition
law for the employees concerned. Since 2011, it has also
distributed “The way we compete’, an ethical and legal guide
on the conditions of fair competition.

A provision is set aside in the parent company and
consolidated financial statements whenever the Group has an
obligation towards a third party likely fo involve an outflow of
economic resources whose cost can be reliably estimated.

There are no other governmental procedures, legal or
arbitration proceedings, including any proceedings or
procedures of which the Company is aware, which are
pending or threatened, that may have, or have had over the
last 12 months, material effects on the financial situation or
profitability of the Company and/or the Group.

1.9.3. INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RISKS

In order to improve the efficiency and productivity of its
industrial processes, L'Oréal carries out most of its production
in 44 factories, each specialising in a specific type of
technology.

1.9.3.1.

Products must be made available on the market on the
scheduled dates to meet time-to-market and customer
demands, in order to enable new product ranges to be
referenced by distributors in a cosmetics market that requires
companies to be increasingly responsive.

Production and supply chain

A major stoppage of activity at a factory or distribution centre
could therefore have an adverse effect on the achievement of
commercial objectives.

| 44 | REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / L’OREAL 2015

To prevent this risk, business continuity plans exist for each
operational site. These aim at planning for the unavailability of
part of the Group’s supply chain as far as possible and
resuming business activities as quickly as possible.

1.9.3.2. Supplier dependence

L’Oréal is dependent on its external suppliers for the delivery of
materials (raw materials and packaging items) that are
essential for the manufacture of finished products, which may
therefore suffer a disruption as the result of a failure by an
important supplier.

In order to prevent these risks, L'Oréal has prepared
production continuity plans which aim to identify replacement
solutions (e.g., supplier back-up, availability of several moulds
for articles for strategic products, etc.).

1.9.3.3. Environment and safety

The cosmetics industry has a limited environmental risk profile.
However, as is the case for any production, distribution,
research and general administration operations, L’Oréal is
exposed to safety and environmental issues (for example
related to the use of certain raw materials, the use of
machines or electrical equipment in production or storage
areas, handling operations liable to cause accidents involving
bodily injury, waste water treatment, etc.). The main risk for the
Group's industrial sites is the risk of fire due to the inflammable
materials used in products (alcohol, propellant gases,
powders, oxidants and solvents) and the storage of
combustible products and chemicals.

The Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy aims
to minimise the impact on the environment and guarantee the
health and safety of employees, customers and the
communities in which L'Oréal carries out its activities. As a
result of this policy, the risks inherent in our business activities
are systematically identified and brought under control.
Moreover, under its Sharing Beauty With All programme, the
Group pursues its initiatives aimed at reducing its
environmental footprint by setting itself ambitious, concrete
targets (see chapter 3).

This rigorous EHS policy has been implemented throughout the
Group for many years.

The Operations Division issues Internal Rules that set out the
principles of L’Oréal’s EHS policy. An EHS officer is appointed at
each site. Training programmes are systematically organised.
EHS performance indicators are collected monthly from all
production sites, distribution centres and research centres. This
data is collected quarterly for most of the administrative sites.
Fire risk is dealt with in the framework of very strict fire
prevention standards (National Fire Protection Association
standards).


--- Page 40 ---

The L’Oréal Group operates 104 industrial sites, of which two
are classified as “Seveso high threshold’ and are therefore
subject to strict regulations through the European Union
Seveso Directive on the prevention of major accident hazards
due to the storage of chemicals or inflammable products.

1.9.3.4. EHS risk map and audits

Within the scope of this EHS policy, prevention for the industrial
sites is based on the Safety Hazard Assessment Procedure
(SHAP), whereby employees on the ground assess risks under
the responsibility of the Site Manager. This programme helps
identify dangers both overall and for each workstation, and
assesses the corresponding risks. Using the SHAP method, a risk
map is drawn up for the sites, the level of risk is assessed and
the necessary oversight measures are put in place. The
approach is based on a dialogue between those in charge
and contributes to a significant collective improvement in risk
management. This approach is constantly evolving and is
updated regularly in line with changes at sites and experience
on the ground. EHS audits are conducted every three or four
years in each factory and distribution centre. The risk map is
reviewed within the scope of these audits. In 2015, an EHS risk
audit was carried out at 12 factories and 16 distribution
centres.

1.9.3.5. Constant concern for employee

safety

Employee health and safety is one of L’Oréal’s priorities and is
an integral part of the EHS policy and the Group’s human and
social policy. It is rooted in the evaluation and prevention of
professional risks in the Company as described in detail in
chapter 3. Nevertheless, the risk of accidents at the workplace
or occupational diseases cannot be entirely ruled out.

The Group implements the necessary means to ensure that it is
in compliance with the applicable health and safety legislation
and regulations in the various countries where it
operates. Within the scope of the Commitments for 2020 under
the Sharing Beauty With All programme, L'Oréal employees will
notably have access to healthcare coverage and social
protection wherever they are in the world. L’'Oréal wants its
geographical expansion to go hand-in-hand with social
protection for L'Oréal employees all over the world. L’Oréal’s
employees will benefit from healthcare coverage aligned with
the best practices in the country in which they are based.
Financial protection will also be provided for all L’Oréal
employees should unforeseen life events such as permanent
disability occur.

1.9.4. COUNTERPARTY RISK

The Group deals primarily with international banks and
insurance companies which have been ranked investment
grade by the three main specialised rating agencies.

Presentation of the Group
RISK FACTORS*

When the Group makes financial investments, in the form of
either bank deposits or marketable securities (see note 9.2.,
Cash and cash equivalents of the Consolidated financial
statements in chapter 4), it gives priority to short-term
transferable instruments from first-rate financial institutions.

The Group therefore considers that its exposure to
counterparty risk is low (see note 10.5., Counterparty risk of the
Consolidated financial statements in chapter 4).

1.9.5. CUSTOMER RISK

Customer risk may result from a failure to collect receivables
due to cash problems encountered by customers or to
customers no longer being in business.

However, this risk is limited by the Group's policy of taking out
receivables insurance cover as far as this is permitted by local
conditions. The risk associated with credit insurance is
mentioned below in section 1.9.8.2.

Due to the large number and variety of distribution channels
worldwide, the likelihood of a significant impact on the Group
as a whole remains limited. The 10 largest distributor customers
represent 19.4% of the Group’s sales. The amount provisioned
which is considered at risk of non-collection is set out in
note 3.3.2., Trade accounts receivable of the Consolidated
financial statements in chapter 4. This amount does not
exceed 2% of gross accounts receivable.

1.9.6. LIQUIDITY RISK

The Group's Financial Services Department centralises all the
subsidiaries’ financing needs and also negotiations with
financial institutions so as to have better command over
borrowing conditions. Any transactions that may be carried
out directly by subsidiaries are closely supervised.

The L’Oréal Group's liquidity risk is managed with the primary
aim of ensuring continued financing and optimising the
financial cost of debt.

To this effect, the Group has unused confirmed credit lines
from several first-rate banks totalling €3,813 million, including
450 million in USD facilities (€413 million). In all, €350 million
matures within 1 year and €3,463 million matures within 1 to 4
years (see note9.1.9., Confirmed credit lines of the
consolidated financial statements in chapter 4).

These credit lines are not subject to any conditionality clause
based on financial criteria. The Group also regularly uses the
financial markets through the use of short-term paper in
France and commercial paper in the United States. None of
these debts contains an early repayment clause linked to
compliance with financial ratios (covenants) (see note 9.1.1.,
Debt by type, 9.1.2., Debt by maturity date, and note 10.6.,
Liquidity risk of the Consolidated financial statements in
chapter 4).

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / L’OREAL 2015 | 45 |


--- Page 41 ---

| Presentation of the Group
RISK FACTORS*

When the Group makes financial investments, in the form of
either bank deposits or marketable securities, it gives priority to
shortterm transferable instruments from first-rate financial
institutions.

The L'Oréal Group benefits from the following short-term credit
ratings:

@ A-1+, awarded in September 2015 by Standard & Poor's;
@ Prime 1, awarded in May 2015 by Moody's; and
 F1+, awarded in September 2015 by FitchRatings.

These ratings are unchanged compared to those assigned in
2014.

1.9.7. FINANCIAL AND MARKET RISKS

Financial risks include interest rate risks, currency risks, risks
relating to the impairment of intangible assets, equity risks, risks
with regard to assets covering employee benefit commitments
(plan assets), risks relating to changes in tax regulations and
core commodity risks.

1.9.7.1. Interest rate risk

For the requirements of its development and its capital
expenditure policy, L’'Oréal uses borrowings and short-term
paper. The Group mainly refinances at floating rates, as
mentioned in note 9.1.4., Breakdown of fixed rate and floating
rate debt of the Consolidated financial statements in chapter
4, Other details with regard to debt and interest rates are also
provided in notes 9.1.5., Effective interest rates, 9.1.6., Average
debt interest rates and 9.1.7., Fair value of borrowings and
debts of the Consolidated financial statements in chapter 4.

None of these debts contains an early repayment clause
linked to compliance with financial ratios.

In order to limit the negative impact of interest rate
fluctuations, the Group has a non-speculative interest rate
management policy using derivatives as appropriate, as
described in notes 10.3. Hedging of interest rate risk and 10.4.
Sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the Consolidated
financial statements in chapter 4.

1.9.7.2. Currency risk

Due to its international presence, L’Oréal is naturally exposed
to currency fluctuations. Fluctuations between the main
currencies may therefore have an impact on the Group’s
results when translating the foreign currency financial
statements of subsidiaries into euros, and may therefore make
it difficult to compare performances between two financial
years. In addition, commercial flows resulting from purchases
and sales of items and products arise between subsidiaries in
different countries. Procurement by subsidiaries is mainly in the
currency of the supplier's country.

In order to limit currency risk, the Group adopts a conservative
approach whereby it hedges a significant portion of its annual
requirements for the following year through forward purchases
or sales contracts or through options at year-end.

| 46 | REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / L’OREAL 2015

Requirements are established for the following year on the
basis of the operating budgets of each subsidiary. These
requirements are then reviewed regularly throughout the year
in progress. In order to obtain better visibility over the flows
generated, currency risk management is centralised with the
Treasury Department at head office (Corporate Finance
Department), which uses a specific tool for centralising the
subsidiaries’ requirements by currency (FX report)

The system of foreign exchange risk hedging is presented to
the Audit Committee. The hedging methodology and the
values involved are described in note 10.1., Hedging of
currency risk of the Consolidated financial statements in
chapter 4.

Significant changes in the monetary environment could have
an impact on the Group’s results and shareholders’ equity. The
analysis of sensitivity to currency fluctuations and the impact
on equity are set out in detail in note 11.3., Ofher
comprehensive income of the Consolidated financial
statements in chapter 4. Finally, the impact of foreign
exchange gains and losses on the income statement is
described in note 10.2., Foreign exchange gains of the
Consolidated financial statements.

1.9.7.3. Risk relating to the impairment

of intangible assets

As stated in the section on legal risks, L'Oréal’s brands are a
strategic asset for the Group.

As described in note 7., Intangible assets of the Consolidated
financial statements in chapter 4, goodwill and brands with an
indefinite useful life are not amortised but are tested for
impairment at least once a year. Where the recoverable
amount of a brand is lower than its net book value, an
impairment loss is recognised. Similarly, any difference
between the recoverable amount of each cash-generating
unit and the net book value of the assets including goodwill
would lead to an impairment loss in respect of the asset,
recorded in the income statement. The amounts of impairment
for the last three financial years are provided in note 4.1.,
Other operational income and expenses of the Consolidated
financial statements in chapter 4.

The data and assumptions used in impairment tests carried
out on cash-generating units that comprise material amounts
of goodwill and non-amortisable brands are set out in
note 7.3., Impairment tests on intangible assets of the
Consolidated financial statements in chapter 4.

1.9.7.4. Equity risk

L’Oréal does not invest its cash in shares. Its main equity risk is
the 9.05% stake it held in Sanofi as of December 31", 2015, for
an amount described in note 9.3., Non-current financial assets
of the Consolidated financial statements in chapter 4.

If the Sanofi share price suffered a significant or prolonged
decline in value below the initial share price, this would
potentially lead L’Oréal to write down its asset through the
income statement as explained in note 10.7., Shareholding risk
of the Consolidated financial statements in chapter 4.


--- Page 42 ---

1.9.7.5. Risks with regard to assets financing
employee benefit commitments (plan

assets)

By nature, assets used to finance employee benefit
commitments are exposed to fluctuations on the markets in
which such assets are invested.

A sharp, prolonged downturn in the financial markets may
have an impact on the value of the portfolios created (see
note 5.4., Postemployment benefits, termination benefits and
other long-term employee benefits of the Consolidated
financial statements in chapter 4).

Pursuant to the provisions of the Group's Internal Charter on
the Management of Plan Assets, the allocation by category of
assets is subject to limits aimed in particular at reducing
volatility and correlation risks between these different asset
categories. A Supervisory Committee for the Group’s pension
and employee benefit schemes ensures that these principles
are implemented and monitored, as described in the
Employee benefit and pension schemes section in the Social
information section in chapter 3. Moreover, the Group chooses
insurers and custodians with robust ratings from the three main
specialist rating agencies.

1.9.7.6. Risk relating to changes in tax

regulations

The Group is exposed to risks arising from changes in tax
regulations or from their interpretation. An increase in existing
taxes, the introduction of new taxes, or double taxation
concerning in particular corporate income tax, customs
duties, import taxes, the repatriation of dividends or social
levies, could have an adverse impact on the Company's
results.

1.9.7.7. Core commodity risk

The production of cosmetics depends on the purchase of raw
materials whose prices vary. These raw materials or
components are used in the manufacture of products or in
their packaging. The main core raw materials are
polyethylene, polypropylene, aluminium and vegetable oils
and their by-products. An exceptionally sharp increase in the
price of these raw materials or energy prices on the world
market could have a direct effect on the manufacturing cost
of the cosmetics. However, it is estimated that the impact of
this rise on gross margin would remain limited.

In order to anticipate the impact of these fluctuations and as a
preventive measure, L'Oréal negotiates price indices with its
main suppliers of raw materials and packaging items. The
Group therefore does not use hedging.

RISK FACTORS*

Also in order to offset market volatility, L'Oréal rolls out ongoing
efforts in terms of cost-cutting projects and actions to improve
industrial productivity. Pooled responsibility for purchases has
made it possible to reinforce these measures.

1.9.8. INSURANCE

1.9.8.1. The Group’s overall insurance policy

The objective of the Group’s policy on insurance is to protect
the Group's assets and people from the occurrence of
identified material risks that could adversely affect it. For that
purpose, the Group has implemented global insurance
programmes (in particular for the Property Damage &
Interruption of Operations, Third Party Liability and Transport
insurance policies) which make it possible to manage the
insurance cover and provide for uniform insurance cover for all
its subsidiaries throughout the world, except in countries where
this type of arrangement is not permitted

This policy is applied as follows:

@ at parent company level, the Group has negotiated
insurance programmes on a worldwide basis with first-rate
insurance companies to cover its main risks on the basis of
the cover available;

¢ at local level, subsidiaries have to put in place mandatory
insurance cover in order to meet their local regulatory
obligations.

The financial solvency of the insurers chosen is an important
criterion in the Group’s insurer selection process. Most of the
insurance programmes subscribed by the Group involve
co-insurance. Globally, the world’s main insurance companies
are involved in one or more of these Group programmes.

1.9.8.2. Integrated worldwide programmes

Third party liability

For several years, the Group has had in place a programme
for all of its subsidiaries across the globe. This programme
covers the financial consequences of the third party liability of
Group entities. It includes various aspects of third party liability,
and notably operating liability, third party liability related to
products, and sudden and accidental environmental
damage.

Claim activity under this programme has historically been low,
which shows the extremely high quality requirements and
safety standards applied by the Group in managing its
operations and in designing and manufacturing its products.

The health and safety of consumers and employees is a
constant, ever-present priority at all levels of Group operations.

RISK FACTORS*

Property damage and interruption of operations

The purpose of this policy is to protect the Group's assets
against events such as fire, lightning, explosion, theft and
natural disasters within the limits of the terms and conditions
available on the insurance market.

The Group has set up a global programme to cover its
property (chiefly fixed assets and inventories). This programme
also includes a chapter on operating losses directly resulting
from an insured property loss or damage.

As the capacity of the insurance market is limited for certain
risks, this programme includes sublimits, particularly as regards
natural disasters. Finally, it also provides for prevention
inspections for the Group’s sites conducted by specialist
departments of the leading insurer.

Transport

The Group has set up an insurance programme to cover the
transportation of all its products by road, sea and air. All
subsidiaries benefit from the protection offered by this
worldwide programme, which ensures optimum transport
insurance for all flows of goods.

Customer credit risk

Group subsidiaries are encouraged to purchase credit
insurance, assisted by head office and under the terms and
conditions negotiated, in addition to their own credit
management policy, provided that insurance cover
compatible with their level of commercial activity is available
under financially acceptable conditions.

Nevertheless, in a period of major economic slowdown, major
insurance companies could scale back their commitments on
the credit insurance market as they may decide to reduce
their cover of amounts receivable in certain countries. The
insurance policies put in place in these countries could be
affected by this trend.

Self-insurance

Through its reinsurance subsidiary, the Group carries risk
retention levels that are not material at consolidated level, and
these are applicable over and above local deductible
amounts. Two programmes are concerned: Transport and
Property Damage and Interruption of Operations.
