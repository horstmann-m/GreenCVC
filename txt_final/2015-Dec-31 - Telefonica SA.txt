Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

2015 Consolidated Management Report’

Business model

Telefonica is one of the world's leading communications services providers, offering mobile and fixed
communication services with a strategy focused on the possibilities that the new digital world offers and
becoming one of its principal leaders.

Telefénica’s aim is to reinforce its position as an active player in the digital world by seizing all the
opportunities afforded by its global scale and its industrial and strategic alliances.

Telefonica’s current organizational structure is composed of the following segments: Telefonica Spain,
Telefonica Brazil, Telefonica Germany and Telefénica Hispanoamérica (comprised of our consolidated
subsidiaries in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and Central America, Ecuador and
Uruguay). These segments include the information related to wireline, wireless, DSL, TV, and other digital
services provided in each country or countries. Any services not specifically included in these new
segments are part of “Other companies and eliminations”.

On March 24 2015, Telefonica signed an agreement with Hutchison on the sale of Telefénica’s
operations in the United Kingdom. Therefore, Telefénica’s operations in the United Kingdom are reported
as discontinued operations, and its assets and liabilities are classified as “held for sale” in compliance with
IFRS. 2014 and 2013 results have been retrospectively revised and are reported following these same
criteria.

The Telefonica Group's strategy aims to:
e Enhance value through:

o Offering excellent connectivity

o Providing a bundled offer with video and digital services

o Providing increased customer value and customer experience
¢ With the following enablers:

o End-to-end Digitalization: reducing our legacy investments to increase virtualization,
reduce physical servers, data centers and applications

o Big Data and Innovation to add value to our customers

o Continued focus on capital allocation in our legacy investments and simplification
processes

In addition, Telefénica maintains an industrial alliance with China Unicom. Furthermore, in order to
potentially unlock the value of Telefonica’s scale, the “Partners” program was created in 2011, and now
includes five operators (Bouygues, Etisalat, Sunrise, Megafon and 02 Czech Republic). The Telefonica
Partners Program is an initiative that makes available to selected operators and under commercial terms
a host of services that allows partners to leverage on Telefénica's scale and to cooperate on key business
topics (digital services, roaming, services to multinationals, procurement that allows us to deliver our
financial commitments, devices, etc.).

1 This Management Report has been prepared taking into consideration the “Guidelines on the preparation of annual

corporate governance reports for listed companies” published by the CNMV in July 2013.

Moreover, Telefonica has increased its presence in key markets. In 2014 Telefénica acquired E-Plus
(through Telefonica Germany) and in 2015 Telefonica acquired DTS (through Telefonica Spain) and GVT
(through Telefonica Brazil).

On February 10, 2016, Telefénica announced the creation of “Telxius" a company which brings together
certain infrastructure assets of the Group in several countries, which will enable the management of the
Telefonica Group's infrastructure on a global scale with a more specialized and focused approach, with
the aim of increasing the services provided to other operators, improving the return on capital invested
and allowing Telefonica to participate more actively in the growth opportunities that exist in the industry,
including the possibility of incorporating third party assets.

2015 highlights

In 2015 Telefénica has taken further steps aimed at achieving profitable and sustainable long-term
growth and has also improved its competitive position in key markets. Commercial activity in fiber,
smartphones, LTE and Pay-TV has intensified, leading to revenue growth acceleration (+8.7% year-on-
year in reported terms).

In 2015, revenues totaled 47,219 million euros, 8.7% higher than 2014.

OIBDA totaled 11,414 million euros in 2015, down 17.2% in reported terms, and was adversely affected
by a restructuring costs provision of 3,212 million euros in 2015. In organic terms (which term and
calculation is explained further below), OIBDA was up 3.6%, due mainly to to the positive evolution of
Telefonica Germany (+20.9% year-on-year), reflecting increased synergies, as well as the positive results
rom Telefonica Hispanoamérica (+7.2% year-on-year).

The evolution of foreign exchange rates impacted negatively in the 2015 consolidated financial results, in
particular the depreciation of several Latin American currencies against the euro, such as the Brazilian
real and to a lesser extent the implicit depreciation of the Venezuelan bolivar.

In the 2015 consolidated financial statements, the Company used the exchange rate of the Venezuelan
bolivar set at the denominated SIMADI, which at December 31, 2015 was set at 199 Venezuelan bolivar
uerte per U.S. dollar, for the purpose of translating the transactions, cash flows and balances related to
the investments in Venezuela. In the 2014 consolidated financial statements, Telefonica used the
exchange rate of the Venezuelan bolivar set at the denominated SICAD II (set at 49.988 Venezuelan
bolivar fuerte per U.S. dollar).

Telefénica's total accesses totaled 322.3 million as of December 31, 2015. Telefonica United Kingdom
customers have been excluded from our 2014 and 2015 customer base, since we have classified
Telefonica United Kingdom as a disposal group held for sale and its operations have been classified as
discontinued operations. Group accesses increased 1.9% year-on-year, as a result mainly of the
additional accesses gained following the purchase of GVT by Telefonica Brazil and DTS in Spain and the
growth in accesses in Telefonica Hispanoamérica and Telefonica Germany. If we consider the accesses
from GVT and DTS as of December 31, 2014 to make both years comparable, accesses would have
decreased by 1.1% affected, in part, by prepaid disconnections in Telefonica Brazil (which resulted in the
disconnection of 11.5 million accesses in 2015 and 1.6 million accesses in 2014). In 2015, commercial
activity increased based on high value customers, resulting in a sustained growth of the contract mobile
segment (smartphones and LTE), fiber and Pay TV. Accesses in Telefonica Hispanoamérica (41.8% of the
Group's total as of December 31, 2015) increased by 2.3% year-on-year, while accesses in Telefonica
Germany (15.0% of the Group’s total) increased by 1.5% year-on-year.

The Group's strategy is based on capturing growth in its markets, especially on attracting high-value
customers.

Mobile accesses totaled 247.1 million at December 31, 2015, down 1.2% compared to December 31,
2014, affected mainly by the decrease in prepay accesses due to the disconnection of prepay accesses in
Brazil (11.5 million accesses in 2015 and 1.6 million accesses in 2014). Contract accesses, however, were
up 5.6% year-on-year, continuing to increase their weight over total mobile accesses up to 36.3% (+2.3
p.p. year-on-year).

Smartphone accesses maintained a strong growth rate (up 42.9% year-on-year), totaling 112.9 million
accesses and reaching a penetration rate over total accesses of 48.5% (+14.8 p.p. year-on-year),
reflecting the Company's strategic focus on the growth of its data services.

Fixed broadband accesses stood at 21.0 million at December 31, 2015, up 18.7% year-on-year (of
which 16.7 p.p. was due to the inclusion of accesses from GVT in the 2015). Fiber accesses stood at 6.1
million at December 31, 2015.

TV accesses totaled 8.3 million at December 31, 2015, up 63% year-on-year (of which 28 p.p. was due to
the inclusion of accesses from DTS and 17 p.p. was due to the inclusion of accesses from GVT in the 2015
access base).

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

Year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in “organic terms” intend to
present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis, by considering a constant perimeter of
consolidation and constant exchange rates and by making certain other adjustments which are described
herein. We believe that “organic” variations, while not a substitute for reported variations, provide useful

information for investors and other interested parties because:

e they give additional information on the underlying performance of the operating business,
removing the impact of certain items we believe are less relevant when considering the

performance of Telefénica’s underlying business;

e Telefonica uses this data internally to assess its profitability; and

e we believe this data facilitates the comparison between Telefénica's performance with that of
other operators, although “organic” is not a term defined in IFRS, and “organic” measures
included herein may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

Telefonica, S.A. 194

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

For purposes of this report, “organic” variation is defined as the reported variation as adjusted to exclude
the impact of certain items which we believe are less relevant when considering the performance of
Telefénica’s underlying business.

The adjustments made to calculate 2015/2014 organic variations are the following:

Foreign exchange effects and the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela:

We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average
foreign exchange rates in 2015 and 2014. In particular, we have used the average foreign
exchange rates of 2014 for both years.

Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on our reported 2015 results, mainly due to the
depreciation of various Latin American currencies versus the euro, in particular the Brazilian real
and, to a lesser extent, the Venezuelan bolivar.

We have also excluded the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela by reversing
such adjustments.

Changes in the scope of consolidation:

We have excluded the impact of changes in our consolidation perimeter in 2015 and 2014. The
main changes in our consolidation perimeter in such years related to the consolidation of GVT in
Telefonica Brazil since May 2015, the consolidation of DTS in Telefonica Spain since May 2015,
the consolidation of E-Plus in Telefonica Germany since October 2014 and the sale of Telefonica
Ireland in July 2014.

In order to exclude the impact of these changes in our perimeter, we have:
o consolidated GVT's results from May 1 to December 31, 2014 in our 2014 results;
o consolidated DTS's results from May 1 to December 31, 2014 in our 2014 results;
o consolidated E-Plus’s results from January 1 to September 30, 2014 in our 2014 results; and
o excluded Telefonica Ireland's results from January 1 to June 30, 2014 from our 2014 results.
Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs, mainly those related to the 1st
Collective Agreement of Related Companies in Spain, restructuring processes relating to
Germany and Brazil and the Group's simplification program.

In 2015, these restructuring costs totaled 3,212 million euros and were aimed at increasing
future efficiency, representing a further step towards the transformation and simplification
initiatives carried out by Telefonica. These costs were distributed by segment as follows
(impacts in OIBDA): Telefonica Spain (2,896 million euros), Telefonica Germany (74 million
euros), Telefonica Hispanoamérica (38 million euros), Telefonica Brazil (7 million euros) and
other companies (197 million euros).

In 2014, these restructuring costs totaled 658 million euros and were attributable to the
simplification initiatives that the Group has implemented to meet its targets. These costs were
mainly distributed by segment as follows (impacts in OIBDA): Telefonica Germany (414 million
euros), Telefonica Brazil (68 million euros), Telefonica Hispanoamérica (99 million euros, mainly
in Peru) and other companies (77 million euros).

Telefonica, S.A. 195

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Results of tower sales:
The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2015 and 2014 have been excluded in both years.

In 2015 the results from the sale of towers totaled 65 million euros, distributed as follows:
Telefonica Spain (38 million euros), Telefonica Brazil (10 million euros) and Telefonica
Hispanoamérica (18 million euros, mainly in Chile). In 2014 the results from the sale of towers
totaled 196 million euros in OIBDA, mainly in Telefénica Spain (191 million euros).

e Irrevocable commitment with Fundacién Telefonica:

In 2015 we have excluded the expense (325 million euros) resulting from Telefénica, S.A.'s
irrevocable commitment to make a donation to Fundacién Telefénica in order to provide this
entity with the financing required so that it can carry out its existing or new social programs and
non-profit activities in the short and medium term.

e Adjustments to the final purchase price of E-Plus:

In 2015 we have excluded the result from the difference between the preliminary purchase price
of E-Plus (as estimated at the end of the valuation period) and the final purchase price agreed
with KPN, totaling 104 million euros (which had a 102 million euros positive impact on OIBDA,
net of costs related to the acquisition).

e Spectrum acquisition:
We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2015 and 2014.

In 2015, these acquisitions totaled 1,585 million euros, 1,198 million euros corresponding to
Telefonica Germany, 49 million euros corresponding to Telefonica Spain and 338 million euros
corresponding to Telefonica Hispanoamérica (mainly Argentina and Ecuador).

In 2014 these acquisitions totaled 1,294 million euros, 889 million euros corresponding to
Telefonica Brazil and 405 million euros corresponding to Telefonica Hispanoamérica with the
following distribution by country or region:

o Telefénica Argentina (168 million euros);

o Telefénica Colombia (111 million euros); and

o Telefénica Venezuela and Central America (126 million euros).
e Real Estate Efficiency Plan:

In 2014 we have excluded the impact of certain urban assets qualification changes in Telefonica
Spain and also the investment in Telefénica's Barcelona head office, which had an impact on
capital expenditures (Capex) of 78 million euros.

e¢ Other adjustments:

We have excluded the impact of the impairment resulting from the deterioration in certain
minority participations, totaling 23 million euros in 2015. We have also excluded the impact of
the 30 million euros provision recorded in 2015 in Telefonica Spain to optimize the distribution
network.

Results discussion

Revenues totaled 47,219 million euros in 2015, increasing 8.7% compared to 2014 in reported terms.
This increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted for
8.8 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign
exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-4.4 p.p.). In organic terms, revenues increased 4.0% due
to higher connectivity revenues, mainly in the mobile business as a consequence of the strong data
revenue growth. The growing focus on our key markets was reflected in the revenue mix with Telefonica
Spain, Telefonica Brazil and Telefonica Germany accounting for 66.0% of the revenues, increasing local
scale and keeping at the same time the Group's differential diversification and global scale.

The structure of revenues reflects Telefénica's business diversification. Despite the adverse impact of
exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela, the segment with the largest contribution to our

Telefonica, S.A. 197


--- Page 11 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

revenues in 2015 was Telefénica Hispanoamérica, representing 30.5% (+0.2 p.p. compared to 2014),
followed by Telefonica Spain, representing 26.3% (-1.4 p.p. compared to 2014), Telefonica Brazil,
representing 23.4% (-2.4 p.p. compared to 2014) and Telefonica Germany, which increased its
contribution with respect to 2014 to 16.7% (+4 p.p. year-on-year).

e Mobile business revenues totaled 27,936 million euros in 2015 (of which 24,510 million euros
corresponded to service revenues and 3,505 million euros corresponded to handset revenues) up
7.7% year-on-year in reported terms. This increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation
of E-Plus (which accounted for 7.8 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), which was partially offset
by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-5.0 p.p.).
Excluding these impacts, year-on-year growth was 4.6% due to higher mobile revenues in
Telefonica Hispanoamérica and Telefonica Brazil as a result mainly of the increase in the
customer base and data adoption.

Mobile service revenues totaled 24,510 million euros in 2015, up 6.5% year-on-year in
reported terms. This increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus (which
accounted for 7.4 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of
changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-5.2 p.p.). Excluding these
impacts, year-on-year growth was 4.0% due mainly to the higher customer base and higher data
consumption.

Mobile data revenues totaled 10,501 million euros in 2015, up 22.5% in reported terms. This
increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus (which accounted for 10.8 p.p. of
the year-on-year increase) and the higher consumption of data of our customers, which was
partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in
Venezuela (-6.9 p.p.). Excluding these impacts, mobile data revenues increased by 16.9% due
mainly to the increased revenues of non-SMS data (up 25.3%) and higher use of data per
customer. Mobile data revenues accounted for 42.5% of mobile service revenues in 2015, up 5.7
percentage points compared to 2014 in reported terms.

e Fixed revenues totaled 17,634 million euros in 2015, up 9.3% year-on-year in reported terms.
This increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of GVT and DTS (which accounted for
+11.1 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of changes in
foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-4.1 p.p.). Excluding these impacts, fixed
revenues increased 2.2%. This increase was mainly due to higher broad band connection
revenues and Pay-TV revenues as a result of the commercial actions carried out by the Company
in order to increase our value proposition and the higher customer base in Pay-TV.

Other income in 2015 mainly included own work capitalized in our fixed assets, profit from the sale of
other assets, and the sale of towers by Telefonica Spain, Telefonica Brazil and Telefonica
Hispanoamérica.

In 2015, other income totaled 1.841 million euros, up 21.1% year-on-year in reported terms. In 2015,
other income was positively affected by the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS, the positive result
from the E-Plus price adjustment (104 million euros), the positive impact from the expired payment
obligation (98 million euros) in Telefonica Brazil, the spectrum swap with AT&T in Telefonica Mexico
carried out in December 2015 (79 million euros), the sale of real estate in Telefonica Spain (78 million
euros) and the result from the sale of towers amounting to 65 million euros.

In 2014, the sale of towers had a positive impact of 196 million euros. Other income also included an
extraordinary sale of real estate in Telefonica Spain (63 million euros).

Total expenses (which include supply costs, personnel costs and other expenses (principally external
services and taxes) but do not include amortization and depreciation expenses), were 37,646 million
euros in 2015, up year-on-year 20.7% in reported terms. This increase was mainly attributable to the

Telefonica, S.A. 198

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted for 10.2 p.p. of the year-on-year increase) and
higher restructuring costs amounting to 3,212 million euros (which accounted for 8.2 p.p. of the year-on-
year increase), which was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and
hyperinflation in Venezuela (-4.2 p.p.). The costs are explained in detail below:

e¢ Supplies amounted to 12,910 million euros in 2015, up 9.9% year-on-year in reported terms
mainly as a result of the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted for 11.3 p.p. of
the year-on-year increase), and was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange
rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-3.2 p.p.). In organic terms, supplies expenses grew by
1.6% year-on-year, due to increased commercial activity in high-end devices and higher TV
content costs, which more than offset the decrease in mobile interconnection costs.

e¢ Personnel expenses amounted to 9,800 million euros in 2015, up 48.0% in reported terms
year-on-year compared to 2014. This increase was mainly attributable to higher restructuring
costs of 3,143 million euros (which accounted for +38.8 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), the
consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted for 7.6 p.p. of the year-on-year increase),
and was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in
Venezuela (-2.5 p.p.). In organic terms, personnel costs increased 4.1% year-on-year mainly
affected by inflationary pressures in some Latin American countries.

The average headcount was 125,892 employees in 2015, up 11.5% compared to 2014 (-2.3%
excluding the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation). Including Telefonica United
Kingdom, the average headcount 2015 was 133,569 employees, up 10.8% compared to 2014
(-2.1% excluding the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation).

e Other expenses amounted to 14,936 million euros in 2015, up 16.4% in reported terms. This
increase was mainly attributable to the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (which accounted
for 11.0 p.p. of the year-on-year increase), the provision of 325 million euros related to the
irrevocable agreement between Telefonica, S.A. and Fundacion Telefonica for its short-and mid-
term financing (+2.5 p.p.) and to a lesser extent, the impairment resulting from the deterioration
in certain minority participations (+0.2 p.p.) and the increase in other expenses related to
restructuring processes (+0.1 p.p.), which was partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign
exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-6.2 p.p.). In organic terms, other expenses
increased by 8.1% compared to 2014, mainly as a result of increased network costs, higher IT
costs and a higher commercial activity. Increased inflation in some Latin American countries
offset in part the savings resulting from the simplification measures carried out by the Company.

OIBDA was 11,414 million euros in 2015, down 17.2% in reported terms. This decrease was mainly
attributable to the higher restructuring costs (which accounted for 18.5 p.p. of the year-on-year decrease
and included a restructuring costs provision of 3,212 million euros, the impact of changes in foreign
exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (-5.0 p.p.), the provision of 325 million euros related to
the agreement between Telefénica S.A. and Fundaci6n Telefénica for its short and mid-term financing (-
2.4 p.p.) and, to a lesser extent, the decreased results from the sale of towers (-0.9 p.p.), the provision
recorded in connection with the optimization of the distribution channel in Spain of 30 million euros (-0.2
p.p.) and the impairment resulting from the deterioration in certain minority participations (-0.2 p.p.),
which was partially offset by the impact of the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS (+5.4 p.p.) and the
adjustments made to the final acquisition price of E-Plus (+0.7 p.p.).

In organic terms, OIBDA grew 3.6% due to the positive evolution of Telefonica Germany (+20.9% year-
on-year), reflecting increased synergies, the better performance of Telefonica Brazil (+2.9% year-on-
year) and the results from Telefénica Hispanoamérica (+7.2% year-on-year).

OIBDA margin stood at 24.2% in 2015, down 7.5 percentage points compared to 2014 in reported terms
due mainly to the restructuring costs provision of 3,212 million euros in 2015.

Telefonica, S.A. 199

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

By segments, Telefonica Hispanoamérica was the main contributor to Group OIBDA with 38.2% (+8.6 p.p.
compared to 2014), Telefonica Brazil contributed 31.3% (+5.6 p.p. compared to 2014) and Telefonica
Germany contributed 16.3% (+11 p.p. compared to 2014). Telefonica Spain contributed 20.5% to Group
OIBDA, down 20.7 percentage points compared to 2014, mainly as a result of the restructuring cost
provision of 2,896 million euros in 2015.

Depreciation and amortization amounted to 8,517 million euros in 2015, up 14.6% year-on-year in
reported terms, mainly due to the consolidation of E-Plus, GVT and DTS. The total depreciation and
amortization charges arising from purchase price allocation processes amounted to 745 million euros in
2015, up 29.9% year-on-year.

Operating income (Ol) in 2015 totaled 2,897 million euros, down 54.4% compared to 2014 for the
reasons in OIBDA set forth above. In organic terms, operating income grew 3.7% year-on-year as a result
of higher revenues and costs savings.

The share of loss of investments accounted for by the equity method for 2015 was a loss of 5 million
euros (compared to a loss of 498 million euros in 2014). The loss recorded in 2014 was mainly due to the
valuation adjustment of Telco, S.p.A. at Telecom Italia, S.p.A. amounting to 464 million euros.

Net financial expense amounted to 2,581 million euros in 2015, 7.1% lower than the previous year.
Excluding exchange rate differences, costs improved by 21.2% (528 million euros) to 1,961 million euros.
Negative foreign exchange differences amounted to 620 million euros (excluding monetary correction),
primarily due to adoption of the SIMADI exchange rate for the Venezuelan bolivar. The lower cost of debt
in euros explains 146 million euros of this improvement, due to lower fixed rate debt and capture of the
reduction in short-term rates. The divestment of the entire holding in Telecom Italia, S.p.A. generated a
positive variation of 404 million euros. Other effects resulted in losses of 22 million euros. These included
the monetary correction for inflation in Venezuela, net of higher expenses in Latin America currencies,
costs for updating contingencies, and other gains and losses on equities. The effective cost of debt over
the last twelve months, excluding exchange rate differences and the positive impact of the divestment of
Telecom Italia, S.p.A., stood at 4.69%, down 57 basis points year-on-year.

Corporate income tax totaled 13 million euros in 2015 (compared to 260 million euros in 2014) mainly
due to the temporary difference recorded related to the restructuring provision and a higher activation of
tax credits in Spain. Considering a pre-tax income of 311 million euros, the effective tax rate was 4.2%,
4.3 percentage points lower year-on-year.

Profit after tax from discontinued operations totaled 2,582 million euros (compared to 439 million
euros in 2014), mainly due to deferred tax assets resulting from the estimated difference in Telefénica,
S.A. between the tax value and the agreed sale value of Telefénica’s operations in the United Kingdom,
amounting to 1,789 million euros (which are expected to materialize in a foreseeable future when the sale
is completed). This effect has been reduced by the amount corresponding to the tax amortization of
goodwill generated in 2006 in connection with the acquisition of the companies to be sold under the sale
agreement and deducted until December 31, 2015, amounting to 377 million euros. Additionally, the
non-current assets ceased to be amortized and depreciated for accounting purposes once they were
reclassified as assets held for sale.

Profit attributable to non-controlling interest reduced profit for the year attributable to equity holders
of the parent by 135 million euros, 116 million euros less than in 2014, mainly due to the lower profit
attributable to minority interests in Telefonica Brazil and Colombia Telecom.

As a result of the foregoing, profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent for 2015
was 2,745 million euros, down by 8.5% year on year.

In 2015 the commercial activity was leveraged on the differentiated assets of the Company and, in the
second half of 2015 was strengthened by the convergent offer “Movistar Fusion+" launched in July 2015
as well as the promotion that included all “TV Premium Extra” content from 9.90 euros/month, launched
in August 2015. This promotion was subscribed by almost 700 thousand customers, reflecting the
attractiveness of the offer (new TV contents and ultra-speed fiber) in an economic environment where
private consumption continues to improve.

Churn evolution has been positive in 2015, especially taking into account the elimination of “Fusion” long-
term contracts on August 1, 2015. This fact, together with the good evolution in adds since the launching
of “Movistar Fusién+” has resulted in a positive performance of commercial activity. In 2015, broadband
net adds duplicated year-on-year, fiber net adds grew by 25.3%, mobile contract net adds resumed

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

growth (+0.2 million customers) and in fixed telephony the net loss of accesses decreased by 31.1%
year-on-year.

The results of Telefonica Spain in 2015 showed a lower decrease in revenues compared to the year-on-
year results of 2014-2013, as a result of the transformation strategy implemented in recent years which
relies on a high value offer based on the differentiated assets of Telefonica Spain, a more rational market
in competition terms and a more favorable macroeconomic context, with improvement in private
consumption.

Telefonica Spain had 42.0 million accesses at the end of December 2015, up 1.9% year-on-year, after the
consolidation of the DTS satellite TV accesses (0.9 million accesses at December 2015). The organic
variation was down by 1.6%, explained by the decrease in mobile accesses and fixed telephony accesses,
although it is important to highlight that retail accesses grew by 3.1% year-on-year.

“Movistar Fusi6n”, with a customer base of 4.2 million with 1.5 million additional wireless lines to the base
offer as of December 31, 2015, maintained a solid year-on-year growth (+13% and +8% respectively
compared to December 2014) and contributed 81% of the fixed retail broadband customer base and
63% of the wireless contract customer base. There was significant growth in the penetration of the high
value services of “Movistar Fusi6n”, with 31.8% of the customer base already using 100 Mb or 300 Mb
ultra-fast broadband (+10.9 p.p. year-on-year) and 62.4% of the customer base with Pay-TV as of
December 31, 2015 (+17.7 p.p. year-on-year).

Fixed accesses decreased 4.2% year-on-year, with a net loss of 442 thousand accesses in the year 2015.
This decrease was mainly due to a lower fixed access market growth.

Retail broadband accesses totaled 6.0 million and grew 1.3% year-on-year, with net adds of 76
thousand accesses, due to the good evolution of fiber adds (+37.1% year-on-year) and lower churn
(1.4% in 2015, -0.1 p.p. year-on-year).

Fiber accesses posted a new record in terms of net adds (0.9 million new accesses in 2015), reaching 2.2
million customers (1.7 times compared to December 31, 2014), representing 37.3% of total broadband
customers (+14.9 p.p. year-on-year). Two thirds of fiber accesses are benefiting from the new speeds (30
and 300 Mb) launched in May 2015.

Ultra speed fiber accesses, with 100 or 300 Mb (with additional ARPU of 12 euros, including VAT) reached
1.5 million accesses (68.6% of total fiber accesses), after the new record of 0.5 million accesses in 2015,
triggered by the higher level of adds (+25.9% year-on-year) and contained churn (0.9%, +0.1 p.p. year-
on-year).

At December 31, 2015 our fiber deployment reached 14.3 million premises, 4 million more than at
December 31, 2014.

Total mobile accesses stood at 17.3 million, down 1.8% compared with year-end 2014 as a result of the
decrease in prepay accesses. The contract access base accelerated its growth during 2015, growing by
1.6% year-on-year. The positive evolution of contract portability (-162 thousand customers at December
31, 2015, compared to -508 thousand customers at December 31, 2014), resulted in a positive contract
net adds base (excluding M2M) (+68 thousand customers at December 31, 2015, compared to -113
thousand customers at December 31, 2014). Smartphone penetration stood at 66.3% of the mobile
voice base (+5.7 p.p. compared to year-end 2014) and significantly boosted data traffic growth to 86.8%
year-on-year in 2015 due to the higher number of customers with the renewed portfolio containing
superior data packages.

LTE network rollout continued to progress well and coverage reached (based on our estimates)
approximately 75% of the population at the end of 2015, up 17 percentage points compared to
December 31, 2014, thanks to the deployment of the 800 MHz. As a result, the LTE customer base

Telefonica, S.A. 203

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

reached 3.3 million customers at December 31, 2015, doubling the customer base at December 31, 2014,
while the penetration reached 21% (+10 p.p. year-on-year).

Pay-TV accesses reached 3.7 million, up by 94.8% in reported terms compared to December 31, 2014 as
aresult of the acquisition of DTS (+10.5% in organic terms), including 926 thousand satellite TV accesses
from DTS.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Spain, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate
2015/2014 variations in organic terms:

e Changes in the scope of consolidation:

We have excluded the impact of changes in our consolidation perimeter in 2015 and 2014. The
only change to our Telefonica Spain consolidation perimeter in such years is related to the
consolidation of DTS in Telefénica Spain since May 1, 2015. In order to exclude the impact of
such change in our perimeter, we have consolidated DTS's results from May 1 to December 31,
2014 in our 2014 results.

e Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of the 2,896 million euros of restructuring costs in 2015, mainly
related to the Voluntary Suspension Plan in Spain. The restructuring process is aimed at
increasing future efficiency, representing a further step towards the transformation and
simplification initiatives carried out by Telefonica.

No restructuring costs were excluded from our 2014 results to calculate organic variations.

Telefonica, S.A. 204


--- Page 18 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Results of tower sales:

The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2015 and 2014 have been excluded in both years.
In 2015, the results from the sale of towers totaled 38 million euros. In 2014, the results from the
sale of towers totaled 191 million euros.

e Spectrum acquisition:
We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2015, that totaled 49 million euros.
e Real Estate Efficiency Plan:

We have excluded the impact of certain urban assets qualification changes in Telefonica Spain in
2014, totaling 49 million euros.

¢ = Spain distribution channel:

We have excluded the impact of the 30 million euros provision recorded in 2015 in Telefonica
Spain to optimize the distribution network.

The table below shows 2015/2014 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in
accordance with the adjustments referred to above) of certain income statement measures, and the

Results discussion

Revenues in Telefonica Spain in 2015 were 12,402 million euros, up 3.2% year-on-year in reported terms
mainly as a result of the consolidation of DTS since May 1, 2015 (which accounted for +5.4 p.p. of the
year-on-year increase). In organic terms, revenues were down by 2.1% due to lower mobile service
revenues in the mobile business and lower access and voice revenues in the fixed business.

We consider revenue breakdown to be increasingly less relevant given the high penetration level of our
convergent offer, by which we mean the offer of more than a single service for a single price. However, we
continue to report revenue separately for information purposes. Fixed business revenues were up by
9.6% year-on-year in 2015, due to the consolidation of DTS, the repositioning of tariffs, higher retail
broadband revenues and new services, mainly related to TV and IT services. Excluding the impact of DTS,
fixed revenues increased by 1.9%. Mobile business revenues fell 4.8% year-on-year in 2015 due to the
decline in mobile accesses and the 3.6% drop in ARPU.

Telefonica, S.A. 205

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

Mobile ARPU was 15.3 euros in 2015, down by 3.6% year-on-year. Mobile ARPU is becoming less
representative of the Group's business performance, owing to its high dependence on the allocation of
revenue in convergent offers.

OIBDA amounted to 2,336 million euros in 2015, down 58.8% year-on-year in reported terms, mainly
due to provisions recorded in 2015 totaling 2,926 million euros (relating to restructuring cost accounted

channel restructuring) and, to a lesser extent, the lower proceeds (38 million euros in 2015 compared to
191 million euros in 2014) from the sale of towers (-2.7 p.p.). This decrease was partially offset by the
sale of real estate assets amounting to 73 million euros (net of costs).

In organic terms OIBDA decreased 4.3% year-on-year, mainly due to the lower revenues, higher
personnel costs and higher content costs. The higher personnel costs, up by 4.0% year-on-year in organic
terms, were primarily due to the resumption of the Company's contribution to its pension plan in July
2014, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of DTS. Telefonica Spain had 32,171 employees at the end of
December 2015, up 7.2% year-on-year, due mainly to the acquisition of DTS.

OIBDA margin was 18.8% in 2015 down 28.3 percentage points year-on-year.

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

In 2015, Telefonica Germany maintained market momentum, increasing slightly its estimated mobile
service revenue market share.

The total access base grew 1.5% year-on-year and stood at 48.4 million at December 31, 2015, mainly
driven by a 2.2% increase in the mobile base (which reached 43.1 million).

The contract mobile customer base grew 1.6% year-on-year and reached 19.1 million accesses, with a
broadly stable 44.3% share over the total mobile base. Net adds reached 309 thousand accesses due to
the solid contribution of partners (second brands). Smartphone penetration reached 54.2% of the total
mobile access base, up 5.5 percentage points year-on-year driven by the continued growth of LTE
customers (+154.5% year-on-year reaching 7.9 million at December 31, 2015). LTE penetration reached
8.6% of the total mobile access base.

The prepay access base increased 2.7% year-on-year to 24.0 million. Prepay posted 629 thousand net
additions in 2015, 32.5% more than in 2014 due to the strong contribution from wholesale agreements
(second brands). The retail broadband access loss trend continued to improve, with 46 thousand net loss
in 2015, more than halving the number of 2014. VDSL was once again the main growth engine of fixed
performance with 260 thousand net additions (+55% year-on-year) in 2015.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Germany, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate
2015/2014 variations in organic terms:

e Changes in the scope of consolidation:

We have excluded the impact of changes in our consolidation perimeter in 2015 and 2014. The
only change to our Telefonica Germany consolidation perimeter in such years related to the
consolidation of E-Plus in Telefonica Germany since October 1 2014. In order to exclude the

impact of this change in our perimeter, we have consolidated E-Plus’s results from January 1 to
September 30, 2014 in our 2014 results.

e Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of restructuring costs associated with certain simplification
processes implemented in Germany. In 2015, restructuring costs had a 74 million euros impact
on OIBDA. In 2014, restructuring costs had a 414 million euros impact on OIBDA.

e¢ Spectrum acquisition:

We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2015, amounting to 1,198 million
euros. There were no spectrum acquisitions in 2014.

e Adjustments to the final purchase price of E-Plus :

In 2015 we have excluded the result from the difference between the preliminary purchase price
of E-Plus (as estimated at the end of the valuation period) and the final purchase price agreed
with KPN, totaling 104 million euros (which had a 102 million euros positive impact on OIBDA net
of costs related to the acquisition).

Results discussion

Total revenues were 7,888 million euros in 2015, up 42.9% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to
the consolidation of E-Plus since October 1, 2014 (which accounted for 41.1 p.p. of the year-on-year
increase). In organic terms, revenues increased by 1.2% due mainly to higher handset sales arising from
Christmas campaigns.

Mobile service revenues totaled 5,532 million euros in 2015, up 54.5% year-on-year in reported terms,
due mainly to the consolidation of E-Plus since October 1, 2014 and to a lesser extent, the increasing
share of the partner segment (second brands) within the customer base. Telefonica Germany continued
to focus on data revenues, which increased by 58.4% and accounted for 51.3% of mobile service
revenues in 2015. Non-P2P SMS data revenues amounted to 2,034 million euros (increasing 4.9% year-
on-year), accounting for 71.6% of the total data revenues (+0.4 p.p. year-on-year).

Telefonica, S.A. 208

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

Fixed revenues were 1,043 million euros in 2015, down 8.3% year-on-year, due to continued decrease in
accesses.

Mobile ARPU was 10.7 euros in 2015 down 8.9% year-on-year, while contract ARPU stood at 17.2 euros
down 6.5% year-on-year, as a result of the higher share of wholesale customers in the customer base.
Data ARPU was 5.5 euros, down 6.8% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the continued decline of SMS
volumes.

OIBDA totaled 1,858 million euros in 2015, up 153.7% year-on-year in reported terms, as a result mainly
of the consolidation of E-Plus (which accounted for 50.2 p.p. of the increase), the lower restructuring
costs recorded in 2015 (+46.5 p.p.) and the positive result from the E-Plus preliminary acquisition price
and the final acquisition price agreed on with KPN (+13.9 p.p.). In organic terms, OIBDA increased by
20.9% year-on-year, driven by the increased synergies, which mainly affected personnel expenses and
supplies.

The OIBDA margin stood at 23.6% in reported terms for 2015, up 10.3 percentage points compared to

date.

Telefonica Brazil closed the year 2015 improving its competitive position in the mobile as well as in the
fixed market. In the mobile business, Telefonica Brazil kept its leadership in the higher value segments,
which permitted the operator to capture mobile market revenue growth in 2015. In the fixed business,
the transformation towards fiber and Pay-TV was strengthened by the GVT consolidation in May 2015,
adding as of December 31, 2015, 8.5 million customers to the Group.

Revenues and OIBDA evolution was positively supported by the acceleration of mobile data and the good
evolution of fixed broadband and Pay-TV. Additionally, Telefonica Brazil carried out costs control
measures aimed at offsetting the adverse macroeconomic situation.

However, results in 2015 were adversely affected by the interconnection tariff reduction in the mobile
business (-33.0%) and in the retail fixed-mobile tariff (-23.3%) since February 24, 2015.

Telefonica Brazil reached 96.9 million accesses at December 31, 2015, up 1.4% due mainly to the
consolidation of GVT. Excluding the impact of such consolidation, accesses were down 6.4%, due to the
disconnection of prepay accesses.

In the mobile business, the strategic focus remained on gaining and retaining high value customers,
reaching a market share of 42.4% in the contract segment as of December 31, 2015 (Source: ANATEL).
Telefonica Brazil maintained its market leadership in terms of total accesses with a market share of
29.5% as of December 2015 (source: ANATEL). The commercial offer in the contract segment included a
higher data volume, more minutes of voice traffic and innovative products such as “Vivo Bis” (pursuant to
which the data not consumed in a month is automatically added to data available for the following
month). The contract growth was partially offset by the disconnection of 11.5 million prepay accesses.

In the fixed business, Telefonica Brazil maintained its strategic focus on fiber deployment, with 16.6
million premises passed with FTTx at December 31, 2015 and 3.8 million homes connected, and also on
increasing Pay-TV accesses (up 10% year-on-year). Fixed telephony accesses stood at 14.7 million in
2015, up 36.4% in reported terms due mainly to the consolidation of GVT. In organic terms, these
accesses were down by 1.6% year-on-year. Retail broadband customers totaled 7.1 million customers as
of December 31, 2015, up 81.0% year-on-year due mainly to the consolidation of GVT (up 3.6% year-on-
year in organic terms due to the increase of fiber accesses). Of the 7.1 million customers at the end of
2015, 53.0% were connected with FTTC. Pay TV customers stood at 1.8 million as of December 31, 2015,
up 132.0% in reported terms due mainly to the consolidation of GVT, increasing by 9.7% year-on-year in
organic terms due to a higher penetration of high value and IPTV clients. IPTV accesses increased their
relevance, representing 9.6% of total Pay-TV accesses.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in

“organic

terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Brazil, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate
2015/2014 variations in organic terms:

Foreign exchange effects:

We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average
foreign exchange rates in 2015 and 2014. In particular, we have used the average foreign
exchange rate of 2014 for both years. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on our
reported 2015 Telefénica Brazil results as a result of the depreciation of the Brazilian real.

Changes in the scope of consolidation:

We have excluded the impact of changes in our consolidation perimeter in 2015 and 2014. The
only change to our Telefonica Brazil consolidation perimeter in such years related to the
consolidation of GVT since May 1, 2015. In order to exclude the impact of this change in our
perimeter, we have consolidated GVT's results from May 1 to December 31, 2014 in our 2014
results.

Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs associated with certain simplification
processes implemented in Telefonica Brazil. In 2015, these restructuring costs totaled 7 million
euros. In 2014, these restructuring costs totaled 68 million euros.

Telefonica, S.A. 211

e Spectrum acquisition:

We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2014 amounting to 889 million euros
(related to a LTE block in the 700 MHz band) while there were no spectrum acquisitions in 2015.

e Results of tower sales:

The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2015 and 2014 have been excluded in both years.
The results from the sale of towers totaled 10 million euros and 1 million euros in 2015 and
2014, respectively.

Results discussion

Revenues totaled 11,060 million euros in 2015, down 1.5% in reported terms, mainly due to the
depreciation of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -16.6 p.p. of the evolution) and partially offset by
the impact of the consolidation of GVT (+10.1 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year variation was
4.5%, principally thanks to the good evolution in the mobile business (+6.2% year-on-year) as well as the
fixed business (+1.9% year-on-year), which was partially offset by the impact of the regulatory
interconnection tariff reduction (-2.7 p.p. of the year-on-year variation).

e Revenues from the mobile business totaled 6,906 million euros in 2015, down 9.3% in
reported terms due mainly to the depreciation of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -15.3
p.p. of the evolution). Excluding this impact, revenues from the mobile business increased by
6.2% due to the positive evolution of service revenues (+5.3% year-on-year) as a result of the
good performance of outbound revenues, which increased as a result of an increase in the
contract customer base and the higher data penetration. This trend was partially offset by lower
inbound revenues affected by lower interconnection tariffs. Handset revenues were up by 5.1%
in reported terms, due to higher proportion of contract adds and higher smartphones and LTE
handset sales.

e Fixed telephony revenues totaled 4,154 million euros, up by 15.0% in reported terms due
mainly to the consolidation of GVT (+31.9 p.p.) and were partially offset by the impact of
depreciation of the Brazilian real (which accounted for -19.4 p.p. of the evolution). Excluding
these effects, revenues were up by 1.9%, mainly due to the increase in fixed broadband
revenues, which were up by 9.3% supported by the increase of fiber and the growth of Pay TV
accesses with higher ARPU, in spite of the lower retail fixed-mobile tariff (-2.5 p.p.).

Telefonica, S.A. 212

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

The mobile ARPU decreased 13.2% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to depreciation of the
Brazilian real. In organic terms, it increased 1.6% year-on-year as a consequence of the higher data ARPU
which more than offset the negative impact of the reduction in the mobile termination rates. We believe
the high quality of the customer base is reflected in an increase in the outbound ARPU and the 31.5%
growth in the data ARPU.

OIBDA stood at 3,573 million euros in 2015, up 0.9% in reported terms due mainly to the consolidation
of GVT (which accounted for +12.5 p.p. of the evolution) and, to a lesser extent, the lower restructuring
costs incurred in 2015 compared to 2014 (+1.7 p.p.), and the higher results from the sale of towers
compared to 2014 (+0.3 p.p.), all of which was partially offset by the negative impact of the depreciation
of the Brazilian real (-17.0 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year increase was 2.9% due to revenue
growth and cost efficiency offsetting a worse macro scenario with higher inflation, high devaluation and a
higher rate of bad debt. Personnel expenses totaled 1,042 million euros in 2015, up 6.8% in reported
terms as result mainly of the consolidation of GVT, which was partially offset by the depreciation of the
Brazilian real. In organic terms, personnel expenses increased by 3.5% year-on-year due to higher social
benefits and the internalization of the work of certain network contractors which more than offset the
savings resulting from restructuring plans in 2014. In addition, network costs grew due to higher energy
costs and the deployment and improvement of fixed- and mobile networks, legal contingencies and
higher content costs. OIBDA was also positively impacted by the expiration of a payment obligation (98
million euros).

The OIBDA margin stood at 32.3% in reported terms for 2015, up 0.8 percentage points compared to
2014.

particularly strong in Peru (+12.9% year-on-year), Mexico (+22.3% year-on-year) and Chile
(+4.2% year-on-year). Annual net adds reached 1.3 million accesses, primarily due to Peru (+659
thousand net adds) which benefitted from a successful migration strategy (from prepay to
contract). Mexico also showed positive net adds (+327 thousand accesses) due to higher
commercial activity.

e Inthe prepay segment (+1.9% year-on-year), with net adds of 1.6 million customers, growth was
driven mainly by Mexico (+2.9 million customers) while Venezuela and Central America closed
with 1.2 million net adds, partially compensating the net loss in Chile (-0.9 million customers)
and Peru (-0.7 million customers) where we have faced a fierce competition and we have
concentrated on high value customers migrating the best prepaid customers to contract and not
following competition offers that would damage the quality of our networks due to intense
traffic.

e There was growth in smartphones (+43.7% year-on-year) to 40.2 million accesses as of
December 31, 2015, with a penetration over mobile accesses of 36.7% (+10.4 p.p. year-on-year),
related mainly to Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Colombia. 4G handsets also continued to grow,
reaching 8.3 million accesses as of December 31, 2015 (corresponding to a penetration of 7.4%).

Traditional fixed business accesses stood at 12.8 million at December 31, 2015 (-4.1% year-on-year),
with negative net adds of 545 thousand customers, affected by the erosion of traditional fixed business
in the region, including Chile (-5.9% year-on-year), Peru (-4.4% year-on-year), Colombia (-2.1% year-on-
year) and Argentina (-1.9% year-on-year).

Broadband accesses totaled 5.6 million at December 31, 2015 (+4.3% year-on-year), after reaching net
adds of 0.2 million accesses during 2015 due mainly to access growth in Peru (+8.0%), Chile (+5.8%) and

Colombia (+4.0%). The penetration of fixed broadband accesses over traditional fixed business accesses
was 43.7% at December 31, 2015 (+3.5 p.p. year-on-year). There was progressive migration towards
data plans with higher speeds, with 53.4% of broadband accesses having a speed over 4Mb at December
31, 2015 (+4 p.p. year-on-year).

Pay TV accesses totaled 2.8 million (+15.6% year-on-year), with net adds of 0.4 million accesses as a
result of an improvement in all countries in the region that offer the service. Growth was particularly
positive in Peru (+26.7% year-on-year), Colombia (+17.5%) and Chile (+7.2%).

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Hispanoamérica, we have made the following adjustments in order to
calculate 2015/2014 variations in organic terms:

e Foreign exchange effects and the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela:

We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average
foreign exchange rates in 2015 and 2014. In particular, we have used the average foreign
exchange rates of 2014 for both years. We have also excluded the impact of hyperinflationary
adjustments in Venezuela.

e Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs associated with certain simplification
processes implemented in Telefonica Hispanoamérica. In 2015, restructuring costs totaled 38
million euros. In 2014, restructuring costs totaled 99 million euros.

Telefonica, S.A. 215

e Results of tower sales:

The results attributable

to the sale of towers in 2015 and 2014 have been excluded, which

totaled 18 million euros (mainly in Chile) in 2015 and 4 million euros in 2014.

e Spectrum acquisition:

We have excluded the im|

pact of spectrum acquisitions in 2015 and 2014.

In 2015, these acquisitions totaled 338 million euros and related to Telefonica Argentina (196
million euros), Telefonica Ecuador (127 million euros), Telefénica Chile (6 million euros) and
Telefonica México (8 million euros). In 2014, these acquisitions totaled 405 million euros and
related to Telefonica Argentina (168 million euros), Telefonica Colombia (111 million euros) and
Telefénica Venezuela and Central America (126 million euros).

The table below shows 2015/2014 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in

accordance with the adjustment:

Results discussion

Revenues amounted to 14,387 million euros in 2015, increasing 9.4% year-on-year in reported terms
mainly due to the good results of data revenues (fixed as well as mobile) and voice revenues, in both
cases due to a higher customer base, increased consumption and higher data penetration. This increase
was partially offset by foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in Venezuela and the decrease in
mobile termination rates. In organic terms, revenues increased 10.1% year-on-year.

e Mobile service revenues reached 9,160 million euros in 2015, up 8.4% in reported terms mainly
due to increased revenues in Argentina, Peru, Mexico and Chile, as explained in greater a detail

below, which was partia

lly offset by the foreign exchange effects and the hyperinflation in

Venezuela (which accounted for -2.2 p.p. of the year-on-year variation). Mobile service revenues
performance by country was as follows:

e In Argentina, mobile service revenues reached 2,194 million euros in 2015 and grew by
29.2% year-on-year in reported terms mainly due to the good performance of

consumption an

id data penetration and, to a lesser extent, the growth of the voice

business and the foreign exchange effect (which increased growth by 6.4 p.p.). In local
currency, these revenues grew by 22.9%.

e In Mexico, mobil

le service revenues reached 1,539 million euros in 2015, increasing by

8.9% in reported terms mainly due to a higher customer base and the positive

performance of the data business. In local currency these revenues grew by 8.4%,
accounting the foreign exchange effect for 0.5 percentage points of the year-on-year
reported increase.

In Chile, mobile service revenues reached 1,177 million euros in 2015, up 5.8% in
reported terms year-on-year mainly due to the foreign exchange effect (which
accounted for 4.6 p.p. of the increase) and the increase in data revenues that more than
compensated the fall in the traditional voice business and the lower mobile termination
rates. In local currency these revenues grew by 1.2%.

In Peru, mobile service revenues reached 1,390 million euros in 2015, up 11.2% in
reported terms mainly due to the foreign exchange effect (which accounted for 7.0 p.p.
of the increase) and the higher contract customer base, the data boom and higher
inbound revenues.

In Venezuela and Central America, mobile service revenues reached 1,261 million euros
in 2015, down 3.5% in reported terms mainly due to the foreign exchange effect and
hyperinflation in Venezuela (which decreased growth in 35.1 p.p.). Excluding these
effects, these revenues increased by 31.7% mainly due to the higher tariffs in all
services in order to try to compensate the high inflation in Venezuela and the higher
non-SMS data revenues (+83% in 2015), which represented 83.4% of total data
revenues (+11.4 p.p. year-on-year).

Data revenues in the segment were up by 19.5% in reported terms in 2015, reaching 3,198
million euros mainly due to the increase in penetration of data which increased from 31.7% to
34.9% in 2015 and higher data usage. This increase was partially offset by foreign exchange
effects and hyperinflation in Venezuela (which decreased growth by 4.2 p.p.). Excluding these
effects, these revenues grew by 23.6% as a result of the aforementioned increase in penetration

of data.

Fixed business revenues reached 4,070 million euros in 2015, up 12.9% in reported terms mainly

due to

the increase in broadband and new services revenues (+20.5%). Revenues from

broadband and new services, accounted for 64.7% of fixed revenues (+4.9 p.p. year-on-year).
The growth was mainly related to Argentina which experienced a substantial increase in voice
and broadband revenues, as well as Chile and Peru, which had increased broad band revenues.
Excluding the foreign exchange effect and hyperinflation in Venezuela (which decreased growth
by 2.9 p.p.) these revenues grew by 10.0%.

ARPU was up by 6.1% in 2015, due to the data ARPU increase (+19.9% year-on-year) due to the
increase of smartphone penetration and higher average consumption, which offset voice ARPU decrease.
The lower ARPU was mainly due to lower interconnection costs and the devaluation of certain Latin
American currencies against the U.S. dollar, which more than offset the increase in outgoing voice ARPU
(up 7.0% year-on-year).

OIBDA reached 4,356 million euros in 2015, up 7.1% in reported terms (+7.2% in organic terms), being
Telefonica Argentina, Telefonica Peru and Telefonica Chile the main contributors to this growth, as higher
revenues offset higher costs. OIBDA was positively affected by a spectrum swap in Mexico with AT&T in
December 2015 (which contributed 79 million euros). The higher costs were mainly attributable to:

higher commercial costs, due to higher handset costs as a result of higher high-end handset
sales (which more than offset lower interconnection costs resulting from the mobile termination
rates reductions in Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico);

higher personnel costs driven by increases in inflation in some countries of the region;

Telefonica, S.A. 217

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

higher costs related to commercial campaigns, higher network costs due to higher voice and data
traffic; and

higher costs resulting from the devaluation of certain Latin American currencies against the U.S.
dollar.

Additional information by country is provided below:

Argentina: OIBDA reached 1,006 million euros, up by 25.4% in reported terms mainly due to the
exchange rate effect and higher service revenues, more than offsetting the higher costs resulting
from the overall prices increase, although Telefonica continued to carry out cost containment
plans in order to offset the inflation effect. In local currency, the year-on-year variation was
19.2%.

Chile: OIBDA reached 760 million euros, up 7.4% in reported terms mainly due to the exchange
rate effect and higher service revenues, lower supply costs due to regulatory changes (lower
interconnection costs resulting from the mobile termination rates reduction) and efficiency
measures that helped to offset the commercial effort made to gain higher value customers. In
local currency, the year-on-year variation was 2.7%.

Peru: OIBDA reached 943 million euros, up by 11.8% in reported terms mainly due to the
exchange rate effect and higher service revenues, which more than offset higher commercial
costs resulting from higher competitive pressure in the Peruvian market. In local currency OIBDA
decreased by 4.7%.

Venezuela and Central America: OIBDA reached 342 million euros, down by 26.1% in reported
terms mainly due to the exchange rate effect and hyperinflation in Venezuela. Excluding these
impacts, OIBDA grew 15.8% mainly driven by higher service revenues, which compensated the
overall rise in prices, and higher purchases in dollars for services and equipment purchases, which
were affected by the currency devaluation in Venezuela.

OIBDA margin reached 30.3% in 2015, with a year-on-year decrease of 0.6 percentage points in
reported terms. This margin decrease was driven by lower margins in all countries in the segment except
Mexico (which benefitted from higher commercial efforts focused on higher value segments), especially
in Argentina and Colombia.

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

2014/2013 Consolidated results

In this section, we discuss changes in the Group's consolidated income statements for 2014 and 2013.
The consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 set forth
below has been retrospectively revised to show the reclassification of the results attributable to our
operations in the United Kingdom as discontinued operations and are not derived from Telefonica, S.A.'s
consolidated financial statements originally published for such years, which are not included herein.

The Group's total accesses rose 5.7% during 2014 to 316 million at December 31, 2014, including the
additional accesses it gained following the purchase of the E-Plus Group in Telefonica Germany. Excluding
the E-Plus Group accesses from 2014 results and accesses from Telefonica Czech Republic and Telefonica
reland from 2013 results, the increase would have been 1.9%. There was high commercial activity focus
on high value customers, which resulted in the growth of the contract mobile segment (smartphones and
TE), fiber and Pay TV. The volume of fiber accesses also grew, reaching 1.8 million at December 31,
014. Notably, accesses in Telefonica Hispanoamérica (42% of the Group's total) increased by 2.5%, and
accesses in Telefonica Brazil (30% of the Group's total) increased by 3.0% in 2014.

Adjustments made to calculate 2014/2013 organic variations

As stated above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in “organic
terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis. See “—2015/2014 consolidated
results—Adjustments made to calculate organic variations”.

We have made the following adjustments in order to calculate 2014/2013 variations in organic terms:

Telefonica, S.A. 220


--- Page 34 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Foreign exchange effects and the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela:

We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average
foreign exchange rates in 2014 and 2013. In particular, we have used the average foreign
exchange rates of 2013 for both years.

Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on our reported 2014 results, mainly due to the
depreciation of various Latin American currencies versus the euro, in particular the Argentine
peso, the Brazilian real and the Venezuelan bolivar.

We have also excluded the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela by reversing
such adjustments.

e Changes in the scope of consolidation:

We have excluded the impact of changes in our consolidation perimeter in 2014 and 2013. The
main changes in our consolidation perimeter in such years related to the consolidation of E-Plus
in Telefonica Germany since October 2014, the sale of Telefonica Ireland in July 2014 and the
sale of Telefonica Czech Republic in January 2014.

In order to exclude the impact of these changes in our perimeter, we have:
o excluded E-Plus’s results from October 1 to December 31, 2014 from our 2014 results;

o excluded Telefénica Ireland's results from July 1 to December 31, 2013 from our 2013
results; and

o excluded Telefonica Czech Republic's results from January 1 to December 31, 2013 from our
2013 results.

e Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs in 2014, mainly those related to the
simplification initiatives carried out by the Group in order to reach its targets, mainly in
Telefonica Germany, Telefénica Hispanoamérica and Telefonica Brazil. In 2014 these costs
totaled 409 million euros in Telefonica Germany, 99 million euros in Telefonica Hispanoamérica
and 68 million euros in Telefonica Brazil (all impacts on OIBDA).

No restructuring costs were excluded from our 2013 results to calculate organic variations.
e Impact of sale of companies:

We have excluded the impact of the sale of certain companies in 2013. In particular we have
excluded the results deriving from the sale of Telefonica Ireland (16 million euros loss),
Telefonica Czech Republic (176 million euros loss) and Hispasat (21 million euros gain).

¢ Results of tower sales:
The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2014 and 2013 have been excluded in both years.

In 2014 the results from the sale of towers totaled 196 million euros, mainly in Telefonica Spain
(191 million euros). In 2013 the results from the sale of towers totaled 111 million euros, mainly
in Telefonica Spain (70 million euros), Telefonica Brazil (29 million euros) and Telefonica
Hispanoamérica (11 million euros in Mexico, Chile and Colombia).

e Spectrum acquisition:

We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2014 and 2013.

Telefonica, S.A. 221

2015 Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2014, these acquisitions totaled 1,294 million euros, 889 million euros corresponding to
Telefonica Brazil and 405 million euros corresponding to Telefonica Hispanoamérica, with the
following distribution by country or region:

o Telefénica Argentina (168 million euros);

o Telefénica Colombia (111 million euros); and

o Telefénica Venezuela and Central America (126 million euros).

In 2013 these acquisitions totaled 505 million euros and related mainly to Telefénica Brazil (185
million euros), Telefonica Hispanoamérica (251 million euros, mainly in Peru and Colombia) and
Telefonica Spain (69 million euros).

e Real Estate Efficiency Plan:

In 2014 we have excluded the impact of certain urban assets qualification changes in Telefonica
Spain and the investment in Telefonica's Barcelona head office, which had an impact on capital
expenditures (Capex) of 78 million euros.

The table below shows 2014/2013 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in
accordance with the adjustments referred to above) of certain income statement measures:

2015 Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results discussion

Revenues totaled 43,458 million euros in 2014, down 14.0% compared to 2013 in reported terms due
mainly to the adverse impact of changes in exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (which
accounted for -14.4 p.p. of the decrease) and the sales of Telefonica Czech Republic and Telefonica
Ireland (-3.9 p.p.), partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of E-Plus (+1.5 p.p.). In organic terms,
revenues increased 2.9% due mainly to the good performance of Telefonica Hispanoamérica, where
revenues from mobile data and digital services increased.

The structure of revenues reflected Telefénica's business diversification. Despite the impact of changes in
exchange rates, Telefonica Hispanoamérica was the larger contributor to our revenues in 2014,
representing 30.3% (-3.1 p.p. compared to 2013), followed by Telefonica Spain, representing 27.7% (+2.0
p.p. compared to 2013), Telefonica Brazil, representing 25.8% (+1.7 p.p. compared to 2013) and
Telefonica Germany, representing 12.7% (+3.0 p.p. compared to 2013).

Mobile data revenues totaled 8,568 million euros in 2014 and decreased by 8.9% in reported terms
affected mainly by exchange rate differences and hyperinflation in Venezuela and changes in the
consolidation perimeter. Excluding these impacts, these revenues grew by 12.7%, due to the expansion
of smartphones and data plans, mainly in Telefonica Hispanoamérica and Telefonica Brazil. These
revenues accounted for 37% of mobile service revenues in 2014, up 2.4 percentage points compared to
2013 in reported terms. Revenues from non-SMS data were up 2.8% in reported terms (+25.4%
excluding the impact of exchange rate differences, the effect of hyperinflation in Venezuela and changes
in the consolidation perimeter), representing 78% of total data revenues in reported terms (+8.9 p.p.
year-on-year).

Other income in 2014 mainly included own work capitalized in our fixed assets, profit from the sale of
other assets, and the sale of towers of Telefonica Spain, Telefonica Brazil and Telefonica Hispanoamérica,
and totaled 1,521 million euros, up 2.0% year-on-year, mainly due to increased sales of towers (which
had an impact on OIBDA of 196 million euros, primarily in Telefonica Spain with 191 million euros), and an
extraordinary sale of real estate in Telefonica Spain (41 million euros).

Other income in 2013 totaled 1,491 million euros and was attributable in part to the sale of towers o
Telefonica Brazil, Telefonica Hispanoamérica and Telefonica Spain (which had an impact of 113 million
euros in other income and 111 million euros in OIBDA) and capital gains on the assets sale of Telefonica
Germany (76 million euros) and the sale of Hispasat (21 million euros).

Total expenses (which include supply costs, personnel costs and other expenses (principally externa
services and taxes) but do not include amortization and depreciation expenses), amounted to 31,198
million euros in 2014, down by 9.7% in reported terms year-on-year as a result mainly of the impact o
changes in exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela and the sales of Telefonica Czech Republic and
Telefonica Ireland. In organic terms, expenses grew by 4.5% year-on-year, mainly due to higher
commercial expenditures and outlays on networks and systems. The breakdown of our expenses was as

that the Group is implementing to meet its targets) and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the
acquisition of E-Plus. In organic terms, personnel costs rose by 7.1% in 2014 compared to 2013
due to higher prices in some countries.

The average headcount in 2014 was 112,921 employees, down 6.1% compared to 2013 due
mainly to the changes in the scope of consolidation (-2.1% excluding changes to the scope of
consolidation). Including Telefonica United Kingdom, the average headcount in 2014 would have
been 120,497 employees, down 7.2% compared to 2013 due mainly to the changes in the scope
of consolidation.

e Other expenses amounted to 12,827 million euros in 2014, down 9.3% year-on-year in reported
terms mainly due to exchange rate differences and the effect of hyperinflation in Venezuela, the
impact of value adjustments in the sales of Telefonica Ireland and Telefénica Czech Republic,
changes to the scope of consolidation and the recognition of integration costs in Telefonica
Germany. In organic terms, other expenses increased by 8.1% due to higher commercial costs,
higher network costs produced by larger volumes of data traffic and greater outlays on
modernization of the network.

OIBDA reached 13,781 million euros, down 21.1% in reported terms, mainly due to exchange rate
differences and the effect of hyperinflation in Venezuela, the sales of Telefonica Czech Republic and
Telefonica Ireland and the impact of value adjustments relating to such sales and the increased
expenditures on the Company's global restructuring program (including the integration costs in
Telefonica Germany and costs resulting from the simplification initiatives that the Group is implementing
to meet its targets). In organic terms, OIBDA was practically stable (-0.1% year-on-year).

OIBDA margin was 31.7% in 2014, down 2.9 percentage points year-on-year in reported terms.

By segment, Telefonica Spain contributed most to the Group's consolidated OIBDA, accounting for 41.2%
of the total (+4.9 p.p. compared to 2013), Telefonica Hispanoamérica accounted for 29.5% (-2.1 p.p.
compared to 2013), Telefénica Brazil accounted for 25.7% (+3.2 p.p. compared to 2013), and Telefonica
Germany accounted for 5.3% (-2.2 p.p. compared to 2013).

Depreciation and amortization amounted to 7,431 million euros in 2014, a decline of 13.8% year-on-
year in reported terms, due to lower depreciation of fixed assets, mainly in Telefonica Brazil. The total
depreciation and amortization charges arising from purchase price allocation processes amounted to 574
million euros in 2014 (-21.2% year-on-year).

Operating income (Ol) in 2014 totaled 6,350 million euros, down 28.3% compared to 2013, mainly
affected by exchange rate differences and the effect of hyperinflation in Venezuela (-20.4 p.p.),
recognition in 2014 of expenditure on integrations costs in Telefonica Germany and the global
restructuring program, in accordance with the simplification initiatives the Group is implementing to
meet its targets (-7.6 p.p.), changes to the scope of consolidation (-5.2 p.p.), due to the sale of Telefonica
Czech Republic and Telefonica Ireland and the acquisition of the E-Plus Group, and additionally affected
by higher tower sales in 2014 as compared to 2013 (+1.0 p.p.). In organic terms, operating income would
have increased by 2.1% year-on-year.

The share of loss of investments accounted for by the equity method was a loss of 498 million euros
(compared to a loss of 291 million euros in 2013), mainly due to valuation adjustments of Telco, S.p.A. at
Telecom Italia, S.p.A. This, along with the contribution to the year’s results, had a negative impact of 464
million euros in 2014 (compared to a loss of 267 million euros in 2013).

Net financial expense amounted to 2,779 million euros in 2014 (-2.2% year-on-year in reported terms),
and included 290 million euros due to net negative foreign exchange differences primarily as a result of
the Company's decision to adopt the SICAD II exchange rate of the Venezuelan bolivar. Excluding this
effect, net financial expenses fell 9.0% year-on-year, mainly due to a 9.1% reduction in the average debt,

Telefonica, S.A. 224

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

placing the effective cost of debt in 2014 at 5.31%, one basis point higher than in 2013. The greater
weight of debt in Latin America currencies and repayment and maturity of cheap debt in euros increased
the average cost by 47 basis points, while the lower rates in Latin America and Europe reduced it by 41
basis points.

Corporate income tax totaled 260 million euros in 2014 on a pre-tax income of 3,073 million euros,
implying an effective tax rate of 8.5%, 12.5 percentage points lower year-on-year. This was mainly due to
the effect of a review of deferred taxes in Brazil following a change to legislation during the second
quarter of 2014, and to a larger recognition of tax credits in Colombia.

Profit after tax from discontinued operations totaled 439 million euros, a decrease of 0.7% compared
to 2013 and related exclusively to our operations in the United Kingdom.

The following table provides additional information on our discontinued operations:

Profit attributable to non-controlling interests reduced net profit by 251 million euros in 2014, 33.2%
less than in 2013, mainly due to the losses attributed to minority shareholders of Telefonica Germany
impacted by the recording of the restructuring expenses mentioned above, partially offset by the effect
of the review of deferred taxes in Brazil following a change to legislation in 2014, and to a larger
recognition of tax credits.

As a result of the foregoing, profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent for 2014
was 3,001 million euros (down 34.7% year-on-year).

Results discussion

Revenues totaled 12,023 million euros in 2014 (-7.2% year-on-year) showing a softer decline than in
previous years, due in part to a more favorable macroeconomic and competitive environment.

We consider revenue breakdown to be increasingly less relevant given the high penetration level of our
convergent offer, by which we mean the offer of more than a single service for a single price. However, we
continue to report revenue breakdown for information purposes. Fixed business revenues fell 3.6% year-
on-year in 2014, due to lower access and voice revenues, partially offset by higher broadband and new
services revenues, mainly TV and IT. Mobile business revenues fell 11.0% year-on-year in 2014 due to
the decline in mobile accesses and the 10.1% drop in ARPU, impacted by lower prices in the new tariff
portfolio.

Mobile ARPU is becoming less representative of the Group's business performance, owing to its
significant dependence on the allocation of revenue in convergent offers. In 2014 mobile ARPU declined
by 10.1% year-on-year, impacted by lower prices in the new tariff portfolio.

Notes:

(2) Excludes M2M.

OIBDA amounted to 5,671 million euros in 2014, down 10.6% year-on-year in reported terms, due
mainly to lower revenues and higher supplies expense. In organic terms, OIBDA fell 12.6% year-on-year in
2014, affected by the drop in revenues despite the higher commercial effort by Telefonica Spain to
capture the growth and value opportunities in the market and the decrease in total expenses. Total
expenses decreased 1.1% year-on-year, reflecting the control of costs and the transformation efficiency
initiatives implemented in recent years. However, personnel expenses increased 1.2% year-on-year,
primarily due to the end of the redundancy program in 2013 and the Company's contribution to its

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Germany, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate
2014/2013 variations in organic terms:

e Changes in the scope of consolidation:

We have excluded the impact of changes in our consolidation perimeter in 2014 and 2013. The
main change to our Telefonica Germany consolidation perimeter in such years related to the
consolidation of E-Plus in Telefonica Germany since October 2014. In order to exclude the impact
of this change in our perimeter, we have excluded E-Plus's results from October 1 to December
31, 2014 from our 2014 results.

e Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs associated with certain simplification
processes implemented in Telefonica Germany. In 2014, these restructuring costs totaled 409
million euros. In 2013 there were no restructuring costs.

Results discussion

Total revenues amounted to 5,522 million euros in 2014, up by 12.4% due mainly to the consolidation of
the E-Plus Group since October 1, 2014, and offset in part by the lower service revenues during the rest of
the year.

e Mobile service revenues totaled 3,580 million euros in 2014, up by 19.8% year-on-year in
reported terms, due mainly to the consolidation of the E-Plus Group since October 1, 2014 and
offset in part by the lower voice and SMS revenues during the rest of the year. Telefonica
Germany continued to focus on data revenues, which increased 24.3% and accounted for 50.1%
of mobile service revenues. Non P2P SMS data revenues accounted for 71.2% of the total data
revenues (+4.7 p.p. year-on-year), increasing 32.8% year-on-year.

e Fixed telephony revenues fell by 7.8% year-on-year in 2014 to stand at 1,138 million euros. The
main reason for this was a decline in fixed broadband customers (partially mitigated by VDSL
growth) and transit business revenues, impacting slightly on the margin.

ARPU was negatively affected by the consolidation of the E-Plus Group and decreased by 7.1% year-on-
year in 2014, reducing its year-on-year decline compared to 2013, due to the smaller proportional impact
of migration to new tariffs, and the various actions undertaken with respect to the Telefonica Germany's
customer base in order to boost income and data leverage.

OIBDA was 733 million euros in 2014, falling by 44.0% year-on-year in reported terms, mainly due to the
409 million euros provision relating to the restructuring process resulting from integration of the E-Plus
Group, which impact was partially offset by the consolidation of E-Plus. In organic terms, OIBDA
decreased 22.1% year-on-year, as a result of higher handset costs of sale, partially offset by lower
interconnection costs resulting from less SMS and lower interconnection tariffs.

OIBDA margin stood at 13.3% in 2014, down 13.4 percentage points year-on-year in reported terms,
mainly due to the provision relating to the restructuring process resulting from the integration of the
E-Plus Group, which impact was partially offset by the consolidation of E-Plus.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in
“organic terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Brazil, we have made the following adjustments in order to calculate
2014/2013 variations in organic terms:

Foreign exchange effects:

We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average
foreign exchange rates in 2014 and 2013. In particular, we have used the average foreign
exchange rate of 2013 for both years. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on our
reported 2014 Telefénica Brazil results as a result of the depreciation of the Brazilian real.

Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs associated with certain simplification
processes implemented in Brazil. In 2014, these restructuring costs totaled 68 million euros. No
restructuring costs were excluded from our 2013 results to calculate organic variations.

Results of tower sales:

The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2014 and 2013 have been excluded in both years.
The results from the sale of towers totaled 1 million euros and 29 million euros in 2014 and
2013, respectively.

Spectrum acquisition:

We have excluded the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2014 and 2013. In 2014, these
acquisitions totaled 889 million euros (and related to a LTE block in the 700 MHz band). In 2013
these acquisitions amounted to 185 million euros.

Results discussion

Revenues totaled 11,231 million euros in 2014, down 8.1% in reported terms as a result mainly of the
depreciation of the Brazilian real. In local currency, revenues increased by 0.5%, principally due to the
good evolution in the mobile business (+2.9% year-on-year in local currency).

Revenues from the mobile business totaled 7,618 million euros in 2014, falling by 5.9% in
reported terms as a result mainly of the depreciation of the Brazilian real. In local currency,
revenues from the mobile business increased by 2.9% due to the positive evolution of service
revenues (up 3.8% year-on-year in local currency) as a result of the good performance of
outbound revenues, which in turn increased as a result of an increase in the customer base and
the increased proportion of data revenues. This evolution was partially offset by the decrease in
handset revenues (down 11.9% year-on-year in local currency), and the lower inbound revenues
affected by lower interconnection tariffs.

Fixed telephony revenues totaled 3,613 million euros, down by 12.4% in reported terms, as a
result mainly of the depreciation of the Brazilian real. In local currency, revenues were down by
4.2%. This decrease was attributable in part to the lower retail fixed-mobile tariff, which reduced
fixed revenues despite the stable client base and higher minute bundling plans. This was partially
offset by the increase of the broadband and new services revenues (up by 4.0% in local
currency) helped by the increase of accesses connected with fiber, with a higher ARPU, and the
growth of the Pay TV accesses.

The mobile ARPU accounted to 7.3 euros in 2014, down 9.1% in reported terms and 0.6% year-on-year
in organic terms, mainly as a consequence of the reduction of the mobile termination rates. We believe
that the better quality of the clients’ base is reflected in an increase of the outbound ARPU and a 16.0%
growth of the data ARPU.

OIBDA was 3,543 million euros in 2014, a fall of 10.1% in reported terms as a result mainly of the
depreciation of the Brazilian real and, to a lesser extent, restructuring costs incurred in 2014 and lower
proceeds from the sale of towers. In organic terms, OIBDA grew by 0.9%. This growth was attributable in
part to the decrease in personnel expenses (-4.2% year-on-year in organic terms) as a result of the
various restructuring plans and voluntary redundancy programs carried out in 2013 and the decrease in
supplies (-6.3% year-on-year in organic terms). In addition, in 2014 there were lower interconnection
costs due to regulatory changes and lower handset consumption.

The OIBDA margin stood at 31.5% in 2014 in reported terms, down 0.7 percentage points compared to
2013.

Adjustments made to calculate organic variations

As explained above, year-on-year changes referred to in this document as “organic” or presented in

“organic

terms” intend to present year-on-year variations on a comparable basis.

With respect to Telefonica Hispanoamérica, we have made the following adjustments in order to
calculate 2014/2013 variations in organic terms:

Foreign exchange effects and the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela:

We have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates by assuming constant average
foreign exchange rates in 2014 and 2013. In particular, we have used the average foreign
exchange rates of 2013 for both years.

Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on our reported 2014 Telefénica Hispanoamérica
results, mainly due to the depreciation of various Latin American currencies versus the euro, in
particular the Argentine peso and the Venezuelan bolivar.

We have also excluded the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela by reversing
such adjustments.

Restructuring costs:

We have excluded the impact of certain restructuring costs associated with certain simplification
processes implemented in Telefonica Hispanoamérica. In 2014, restructuring costs totaled 99
million euros. No restructuring costs were excluded from our 2013 results to calculate organic
variations.

Results of tower sales:

The results attributable to the sale of towers in 2014 and 2013 have been excluded, which
totaled 4 million euros in 2014 and 11 million euros in 2013.

Results discussion

Revenues were 13,155 million euros in 2014, down 22.0% year-on-year in reported terms due mainly to
the impact of changes in exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela (which accounted for -36.1 p.p.
of the evolution). In organic terms, revenues increased 14.6% year-on-year, due to the good evolution of
mobile and fixed data revenues and mobile voice revenues, in both cases mainly due to customer base
growth and higher data consumption along with higher data penetration, which offset the negative
impact of the lower interconnection rates (which reduced growth by -1.6 p.p. year-on-year).

Mobile service revenues totaled 8,454 million euros in 2014, down 25.7% in reported
terms mainly due to the impact of changes in exchange rates and hyperinflation in
Venezuela. Excluding these impacts, mobile service revenues increased 17.5% year-on-year.
Additional information on the evolution of mobile service revenues, on a by country basis, is
provided below:

°

Argentina: mobile services revenues totaled 1,697 million euros, down 19.8% in
reported terms due to the foreign exchange effect (which decreased growth by 39.1
p.p.). In local currency, these revenues increased by 19.3% due to the good
evolution of voice and data revenues, despite the negative impact of certain
changes implemented in our billing (which implies billing on a per second basis once
a call's first 30 seconds have elapsed), and higher network usage by customer and
data penetration.

Peru: mobile service revenues totaled 1,250 million euros, up 7.8% in reported
terms mainly due to the higher customer base and data massification (non-SMS
data revenues were up 42.7% in 2014) and the launch of LTE which contributed to
an increase in average revenues per client, which more than offset the impact of
changes in exchange rates (which decreased growth by 5.6 p.p.). In local currency,
revenues increased 13.4%.

Telefonica, S.A. 237


--- Page 51 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

° Mexico: service revenues totaled 1,413 million euros, up 5.4% in reported terms due

to the favorable regulatory interconnection terms which allowed the company to
jaunch new competitive offers which boosted the customer consumption level in
both voice and data. This increase was partially offset by the foreign exchange
effect (which decreased growth by 4.6 p.p.). In local currency, revenues grew 10.0%.

° Venezuela and Central America: mobile service revenues totaled 1,305 million euros,
down 65.1% in reported terms mainly due to the foreign exchange effects and
hyperinflation in Venezuela. Excluding the foreign exchange effects and
hyperinflation in Venezuela, mobile service revenues were up by 36.8% year-on-
year mainly due to a tariffs increase of up to 25% in Venezuela, since July 2014, in
all services and a mobile data services expansion driven by non-SMS revenues
growth (+43.4% year-on-year excluding the foreign exchange effects and
hyperinflation in Venezuela), which represented 74.0% of data revenues (+10.5 p.p.
year-on-year excluding the foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in
Venezuela).

Data revenues in the region totaled 2,676 million euros in 2014, down 24.4% in reported
terms as a result mainly of the adverse impact of changes in exchange rates and
hyperinflation in Venezuela. Excluding the foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in
Venezuela, data revenues were up 23%, mainly driven by non-SMS data revenues (+43.4%
excluding the foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in Venezuela) which represented
74.0% of data revenues (+11 p.p. year-on-year excluding the foreign exchange effects and
hyperinflation in Venezuela).

Fixed business revenues totaled 3,604 million euros in 2014, down 10.1% in reported
terms as a result mainly of the adverse impact of changes in exchange rates and
hyperinflation in Venezuela. Excluding the foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in
Venezuela, these revenues increased 8.4% driven by broadband and new services revenues
(+16.2% excluding the foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in Venezuela). Broadband
and new services revenues represented 60.0% of fixed revenues (+5 p.p. year-on-year
excluding the foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in Venezuela). Argentina in
particular, experienced an acceleration of the fixed business with strong growth in access
and voice revenues (which led to an ARPU increase).

+

ARPU was up by 10.6% in 2014 excluding the foreign exchange effects and hyperinflation in Venezuela,
due to the data ARPU increase (+16.0% year-on-year) resulting from higher volume of minutes per client
(+5.4%). Data traffic also increased (+65.3%). This growth was mainly driven by higher smartphones
penetration and higher average consumption per access.

OIBDA totaled 4,068 million euros in 2014, down 26.5% in reported terms as a result mainly of the
adverse impact of changes in exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela. In organic terms, OIBDA
increased by 16.4% as higher revenues registered in 2014 more than offset higher expenses, which were
mainly attributable to:

higher commercial costs, due to higher handset costs as a result of higher high-end handset
sales (which more than offset lower interconnection costs resulting from the mobile
termination rates reductions in Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico);

higher personnel costs driven by increases in inflation in some countries of the region; and

higher costs related to commercial campaigns and higher network costs due to the increased
voice and data traffic.

Set forth below is additional information on OIBDA on a country basis:

Telefonica, S.A. 238


--- Page 52 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Argentina: OIBDA reached 802 million euros, down by 17.9% in reported terms mainly due
to the exchange rate effect. In local currency, OIBDA increased by 22.1% as higher revenues
more than offset the higher costs. Higher costs were attributable to the overall prices
increase, although Telefonica continued to carry out cost containment plans in order to
offset the inflation effect.

e Peru: OIBDA reached 844 million euros, down by 3.5% in reported terms mainly due to
higher costs, which impact was partially offset by the exchange rate effect. In local currency,
OIBDA increased by 1.4% mainly due to higher service revenues, that offset the higher
commercial costs resulting from higher competitive pressure in the Peruvian market.

e Venezuela and Central America: OIBDA reached 463 million euros, down by 73.4% in
reported terms mainly due to the exchange rate effect and the hyperinflation in Venezuela.
Excluding these impacts OIBDA grew 21.1% mainly due to higher service revenues that
offset the overall rise of prices and the higher purchases in U.S. dollars for services and
equipment purchases, both affected by the negative impact of currency devaluation in
Venezuela.

OIBDA margin was 30.9% in 2014, decreasing 1.9 percentage points year-on-year in reported terms as a
result mainly of the impact of changes in exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela.

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

Definitions

Below are definitions of certain technical terms used in this report:

“Access” refers to a connection to any of the telecommunications services offered by Telefonica. A single
fixed customer may contract for multiple services, and Telefénica believes that it is more useful to count
the number of accesses a customer has contracted for, than to merely count the number of Telefénica’s
customers. For example, a customer that has fixed line telephony service and broadband service is
counted as two accesses rather than as one customer.

“ARPU” is the average revenues per user per month. ARPU is calculated by dividing total gross service
revenues (excluding inbound roaming revenues) from sales to customers for the preceding 12 months by
the weighted average number of accesses for the same period, and then dividing by 12.

“Bundles” refer to combination products that combine fixed services (wirelines, broad band and
television) and mobile services.

“Churn” is the percentage of disconnections over the average customer base in a given period.

“Cloud computing” is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby shared
resources, software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility over a
network (typically the Internet).

“Commercial activity” includes the addition of new lines, replacement of handsets and migrations.

“Data ARPU” is the average data revenues per user per month. Data ARPU is calculated by dividing total
data revenues from sources such as Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Services
(MMS), other mobile data services such as mobile connectivity and mobile Internet, premium messaging,
downloading ringtones and logos, mobile mail and wireless application protocol (WAP) connectivity from
sales to customers for the certain period by the weighted average number of accesses for the same
period, and then dividing by the certain period.

“Data revenues” include revenues from SMS, MMS, other mobile data services such as mobile
connectivity and mobile Internet, premium messaging, downloading ringtones and logos, mobile mail and
WAP connectivity from sales to customers.

“Data traffic” includes all traffic from Internet access, messaging (SMS, MMS) and connectivity services
that is transported by the networks owned by Telefonica.

“FaasT” is a cybersecurity technology that scans an organization's system 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, in order to prevent cybernetic attacks.

“Final client accesses" means accesses provided directly to residential and corporate clients.

“Fixed telephony accesses” includes public switched telephone network, or PSTN, lines (including public
use telephony), and integrated services digital network, or ISDN, lines and circuits. For purposes of
calculating Telefénica's number of fixed line accesses, Telefonica multiplies its lines in service as follows:
PSTN (x1); basic ISDN (x1); primary ISDN (x30, x20 or x10); 2/6 digital accesses (x30).

“Fixed termination rates” is an established fixed network tariff that applies when a customer makes a
call to someone in a network operated by another operator.

“FTTx" is a generic term for any broadband network architecture that uses optical fiber to replace all or
part of the metal local loop.

“Gross adds” means the gross increase in the customer base measured in terms of accesses in a period.

Telefonica, S.A. 240


--- Page 54 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

“HDTV” or “high definition TV" has at least twice the resolution of standard definition television (SDTV),
allowing it to show much more detail than an analog television or digital versatile disc (DVD).

“Incoming revenues" refers to the interconnection revenues derived from the completion of calls made
from outside mobile or fixed carriers into Telefénica's network.

“Interconnection revenues” means revenues received from other operators which use Telefénica's
networks to connect or to finish their calls and SMS or connect to their customers.

“Internet and data accesses” include broadband accesses (including retail asymmetrical digital
subscriber line “ADSL,” very high bit-rate digital subscriber line “VDSL”, satellite, fiber optic and circuits
over 2 Mbps), narrowband accesses (Internet service through the PSTN lines) and the remaining non-
broadband final customer circuits. Internet and data accesses also include “Naked ADSL", which allows
customers to subscribe for a broadband connection without a monthly fixed line fee.

“IPTV” (Internet Protocol Television) refers to distribution systems for television subscription signals
or video using broadband connections over the IP protocol.

“ISP” means Internet service provider.

“IT", or information technology, is the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of vocal,
pictorial, textual and numerical information by a microelectronics-based combination of computing and
telecommunications.

“Latch”, is a cybernetic application, protecting accounts and on-line services.

“Local loop” means the physical circuit connecting the network termination point at the subscriber's
premises to the main distribution frame or equivalent facility in the fixed public telephone network.

Share price performance

European equity markets were very volatile in 2015, with the year dividing into two parts. The first part of
the year, to August, saw improving macroeconomic indicators and strong performance by exporting
sectors, supported by a more competitive euro (as a result of ECB stimulus measures), driving markets
upwards. However, uncertainty about economic growth in China and devaluation of the Yuan (increasing
volatility for all emerging economy currencies and causing a collapse in commodity prices) and
expectations of interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve (with the first rise since January 2009
taking place on December 16), dragged the markets back from mid-August onwards. Against this
backdrop, the performance of European indices varied over the year: CAC-40, +8.5%; DAX, +9.6%;
FTSEMIB, +12.7%; EStoxx-50, +3.8%; Ibex-35, -7.2%; and FTSE-100, -4.9%. The Ibex-35 underperformed
its peers due to the greater exposure of some of its companies to emerging economies, politica
uncertainty and the greater weight of exporting sectors in other European indices.

In terms of DJ Stoxx-600 sectors, the gainers in Europe were led by travel and leisure (+19.6%), financial
services (+18.7%) and consumer goods (+18.7%), whilst basic materials (-34.9%), energy (-7.8%) and
utilities (-3.7%) led the fallers. The telecommunications sector was up 8.5% over the year, 1.7 p.p. higher
than the DJ Stoxx-600 (+6.8%), due to operators experiencing a return to revenue growth in genera
terms and a better outlook for the future, together with announced and expected consolidations.

The Telefonica share ended 2015 at 10.24 euros per share, down 13.2%. This fall is reduced to 7.9%
when the dividends distributed in the year (0.40 euros in cash and 0.35 euros in scrip dividend) are
included.

In terms of individual shares, there were noteworthy performances by Telecom Italia (+33.2%, driven by
consolidation in the domestic market, expectations of corporate actions involving its Brazilian subsidiary
TIM, and the entry of significant new shareholders) and Deutsche Telekom (+26.0%, with a positive
performance in its domestic market and the possible divestment of its T-Mobile subsidiary). In addition,
BT finished the year up 17.5%, Telefonica Deutschland rose by 10.8% and Orange was up 9.4%. On the
negative side, Vodafone fell 0.7%, and TeliaSonera was down 16.3%, impacted by corporate governance
problems in its investments in Eurasia.

Other leading Spanish companies by stock market capitalization also struggled (Repsol -34.9%,
Santander -34.8% and BBVA -14.2%).

At 2015 year end, Telefénica's stock market capitalization stood at 50,921 million euros, the eleventh
largest telecommunications company worldwide. The average trading volume in its shares on the
Spanish continuous market was 33.7 million shares.

Research, Development and Innovation

Telefonica remains firmly committed to technological innovation as an essential tool for achieving
competitive advantages, anticipating market trends and differentiating its products. By introducing new
technologies and developing new products and business processes, we seek to become a more effective,
efficient and customer-oriented Group.

Telefonica has developed an open innovation model for the management of technological innovation to
boost the application of technical research in the development of new commercial products and services.
Telefonica focuses on certain applied research and development (R&D) priorities that are aligned with its
strategy. Open innovation initiatives driving this model include the creation of a venture capital fund and
involvement in business collaboration forums, among others. The model also promotes the use of
knowledge developed at technology centers, universities and start-ups, among other sources, and
encourages innovation in conjunction with other agents (e.g. customers, universities, public
administrations, suppliers, content providers and other companies), making them “technological
partners.” Within this open innovation strategy, during 2015 the Open Future initiative has been
consolidated.

Telefonica believes that in order to differentiate its products from competitors and enhance its market
position it cannot rely solely on acquired technology. It is also important to promote R&D in an effort to
achieve this differentiation and reinforce Telefonica's commitment to a sustainable business
development. The policy of the Group's R & D is aimed at:

e developing new products and services in order to win market share;

e boosting customer loyalty;

e increasing revenue;

e enhancing innovation management;

e improving business practices;

e increasing the quality of infrastructure services to improve customer service and reduce costs;
¢ promoting global products;

¢ supporting open innovation; and

¢ creating value from the technology generated.

In 2015, the technological innovation projects undertaken focused on sustainable innovation, process
efficiency, creation of new revenue streams, customer satisfaction, consolidation of presence in new
markets and technological leadership.

Technical innovation activities are a key element of Telefonica's strategy to create value through latest-
generation network communications and services.

In 2015, projects were undertaken to promote the increase of access to information technology, new
services focused on new internet business models, advanced user interfaces, TV distribution, multimedia
content and other added-value services leveraging on the potential of the new infrastructures. These
initiatives, among others, were undertaken based on our objective of rapidly identifying emerging
technologies that could have a relevant impact on our businesses and pilot testing these technologies in
relation to our new services, applications and platform prototypes.

Most of our R&D activities are carried out by Telefonica Investigacion y Desarrollo, S.A.U. (Telefonica I+D),
a wholly-owned subsidiary, which works mainly for the lines of business. In its operations, Telefonica I+D
receives the assistance of other companies and universities. Telefonica I+D's mission is centered on
enhancing the Company's competitive positioning by leveraging technological innovation and product
development. Telefonica I+D undertakes experimental and applied research and new _ product
development with the overriding goal of broadening the range of services offered and reducing operating
costs.

Telefonica I+D's technological innovation activities focus on two big areas:

1. Telefonica I+D's works on the development of new networks, primarily in collaboration with
Telefonica's Global Resources team. These activities are related to new radio access
technologies and fiber; network virtualization technologies, in line with the technology trend
known as software defined networks (SDN); and network optimization and zero touch
developments making networks more flexible and moldable and able to adapt dynamically to
new digital consumer and service requirements.

2. R&D activities to develop new products and services, which are conducted as part of the digital
services strategy. These activities are the following:

o Natural P2P communication of the future, using the Internet and smartphones.

o Video and multimedia services (combining text, audio, images and video) offering a user
experience in all connected devices.

o Advanced solutions in emerging ITC businesses such as cloud computing, security,
financial services or e-health.

o M2M (machine-to-machine) service management associated with energy efficiency and
mobility and with the Internet of Things and their adoption in the urban and industrial
scenario, and as a service creation enabler.

o Making use of user communication profiles to exploit opportunities to operate different
products and business models (marketing campaigns, target marketing, contextual
services, churn reduction, cross-selling, etc.).

With a view over the medium and long term, Telefénica I+D's also boasts scientific work groups that aim
to look into opportunities relating to new networks and services and solutions to the technological
challenges that arise.

In 2015, the new Telefénica I+D center in Chile -launched in 2014 in collaboration with the Chilean
government- was reinforced with the launch of the first MVP (Minimum Viable Product), in the field of
Smart Cities, Smart Industry and Smart Agro.

At December 31, 2015, Telefonica I+D had 654 employees (652 employees in 2014).

The total I+D expense in the Group for 2015 amounted to 1,012 million euros, down 0.9% from the 1,021
million euros incurred in 2014 (959 million euros in 2013). This expense represents 2.1%, 2.3% and 1.9%
of the Group's consolidated revenue for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These figures were calculated
using guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

During 2015, Telefonica filed 21 new patent applications, two of them registered through the United
State Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and 19 through the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office
(OEPM), of which 9 are International applications (PCT). Additionally two utility models were filed, also

Human Resources

Social objectives and policies

At Telefonica people are important and are the core of the business, representing one of the Group's
greatest assets. Our aim as HR department is to develop our employees’ capacities to the maximum in
order to fulfill the compromises agreed with our customers.

Our vision is based on five main pillars:

e Recruit, develop and keep the talented employees to ensure the Company meets its strategic
goals.

e Support the business units integration and the transformation process so that the companies
are aligned with the business objectives.

e Build a customer-focused organization culture.

e Offer a global HR service for managers and employees based on enpowerment and
simplification.

e¢ Become a 100% online department with high self-service options in the HR processes and with
outsourced resources.

Telefonica faces a great transformation in order to continue as a leader in the new digital environment.
Therefore, Human Resources dapartment plays a leading role both in the development of the employees
and in its own transformation process. In 2015 the progressive use of SuccessFactors —the new digital,
on-line, multi-gadget, cloud based and global tool for HR management- implied all global employees. The
highlights of this change are the review and unfification of the following global processes such as
performance, replacements, recruits and training.

Managing talent

Telefénica's main goals are to develop the talent of its employees, give them the chance to shape their
professional and personal lives, and provide them with constant support for their own personal
development.

Assessment of talent produces a management talent map of the entire Company, and a structured
succession plan.

it is a basic management tool that sets us apart from the rest and implements a culture of meritocracy to
facilitate decision-making concerning aspects such as development, organization, compensation etc.

n 2015, a project of talent oriented definition and identification of the profile for the digital
transformation of Telefénica was made: first an analysis to understand what capabilities are needed to
successfully face the current changes and future changes was developed. The key capabilities identified
are the ability to learn, the ability to transform and the ability to quickly adopt new technologies. From
there more than 1,300 directors and junior directors from 26 countries were invited to participate in an
exercise that has allowed to bring together professionals based on their strengths in 4 profiles that
provide us with skills, knowledge and different experiences: Profile Core, core for the development and
execution of business; Profile Transformer, able to mobilize the organization; Digital Profile, people who
learn experiences where new technologies are key; and Transformer Digital Profile, driving people from
the digital transformation within the company.

Employee training

Employee training and learning are an absolute priority for Telefénica as it continues to evolve, since the
Company is in a process of very ambitious transformation. In 2015, initiatives to advance the proposal to
become a Digital Telco were launched, adapting training programs to the digital world and giving
employees more learning capacity through Training Schools, these Training Schools recorded over
50,000 single user accesses entering to different schools: Technical, Commercial, Leadership, Languages,
Finance and Teachers. Universitas Telefonica operates on two levels: on-site and virtual. The facilities at
the Barcelona campus provided on-site training for 2,046 company executives, and in operations with the
concept Telefénica On the Road, for 2,155 middle managers, displacing Universitas teachers to the
countries in Latin America and Europe. All this obtaining a rating of 4.7 out of 5. In all cases it was
achieved with programs focused on leadership and strategy transformation.

In 2015, over 476,732 training initiatives and 4,229 virtual classrooms were performed, progressing in
this digital medium as a learning usual mode. For the company, managing knowledge is a priority.
Because of that, in 2015, the total cost of training in the Group amounted to 44 million euros.

Managing diversity

Telefonica understands diversity management as a business opportunity. A team of diverse
professionals:

1) identifies the needs of our customers, diverse too and provides the service they need;
2) generates innovation: different people thinking different;

3) diverse teams perform better and more productive results.

Our Business Principles include the basic right to equality:

“We support equal opportunities and treat all persons in a fair and impartial manner, with no prejudices in
respect of race, color, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age,
disability or family responsibilities”.

The concept of diversity, however, reaches well beyond this - it is a fundamental value and intrinsic value
to us: Telefonica has professional from more than 24 countries (four of them sit on the Board of
Directors) representing more than 100 nationalities.

In terms of the male/female distribution of our total headcount, at December 31, 2015 Telefénica had
129,916 employees. There were 49,159 professional female employees, or 38% of the total, and 80,757
male employees, accounting for the remaining 62%. The percentage of women reaches the 19% in the
management level.

For all these reasons Telefénica positions the Diversity project as a strategic project as part of its
Responsible Business Plan presented in the Committee on Institutional Affairs headed by Julio Linares
and under the Council.

In 2015 there has been a significant raise awareness among the executive committees of local operators.
As a result of these meetings, Company executives have become sponsors of the project as to promote
diversity on the local level, which in turn are to be grouped around a Global Committee managed by the
global sponsor and member of the Group Executive Committee.

Furthermore, the development of the career acceleration program for women (Women in Leadership)
during the last year is remarkable. 100 professional women of the Group have passed through this
program.

Occupational health and safety

One of Telefénica's priorities is to offer its staff the best possible working conditions at their place of work
or when they are on the move.

As per its Business Principles, Telefonica ensures staff work in a safe environment. Appropriate
mechanisms are therefore in place to avoid workplace accidents, injuries and illness associated with
professional activities by fully complying with prevailing regulations, implementing safe working
procedures, providing training and managing occupational risks.

The Occupational Risk Management System ensures worker health and safety is at the heart of all
Telefonica's processes and services; offering an end-to-end model for rolling out joint action, procedures
and policies. This system enables Telefénica to identify and disseminate practices that are proven to
have an impact on staff welfare and therefore on reducing accident rates.

Environment

Environmental policy, control of environmental risks and climate change

Telefonica has an Environmental Policy which is applicable to all of its companies, which sets out the road
map for the Company to advance towards a green economy, reducing the environmental impact of its
facilities at the same time as developing the potential for digital services to reduce the environmental
footprint of other sectors.

Currently over half of the companies in the Group have Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in
accordance with Regulation ISO 14001, certified by an external body, which contribute to the proper
management of the environmental aspects of the Company and to extending a culture of environmental
responsibility across the whole supply chain. Telefonica has set itself the target of certifying 100% of
operators under ISO 14001 by 2017.

Telefonica’s environmental risks and climate change are controlled and managed under the Company's
global risk model. The environmental aspects of the telecommunications operations are mainly focused
on the risk of high geographical dispersion and energy consumption, which is controlled by means of
environmental management based on uniform processes and a global energy efficiency programme.

Telefonica has a global environmental team made up of experts in environmental management in each of
the Group's companies.

Common minimum standards - Responsible Network

Environmental legislation, which is abundant in almost all of the countries where Telefonica operates,
applies mainly to our network infrastructures. Among these, it is worth mentioning the need to obtain
environmental permits for base stations, waste management, noise control and measuring
electromagnetic fields.

Telefonica has common standards for all of its companies, in harmony with the principle of caution,
establish minimum guidelines for environmental management with the aim of minimising the impact of
infrastructures, these standards go beyond existing legislation. Also, these standards extend to all of our
suppliers and contractors.

Among the activities which the Group carries in order out to manage the environmental aspects of its
operations, are the design and optimal transmission of new sites for network rollout, promoting shared
infrastructure with other operators and the development of adjustments to reduce the visual impact of
mobile phone antennas.

Main lines of action

Within the Responsible Business Strategic Plan, the Company has established lines of action regarding
the environment. This plan is also grounded in each county in order to be able to focus on the most
relevant aspects at a local level. Some of the lines of action are:

e Energy and climate change - by means of the Corporate Climate Change Office the Company
promotes energy efficiency and the reduction of Telefénica's carbon footprint. Currently, under a
structured corporate management model and an energy management figure in each country, an
Energy Efficiency Programme is being carried out in each country, which has managed to make a
reduction of 500 GWh in 5 years with almost 300 projects, and avoid the emission of over 140 Kt of
CO2. Telefonica has corporate energy and emissions reduction targets, 30% KWh/access to the
network and 10% KWh/used in offices by 2015, the new framework of objectives for 2020 are
currently being defined. Also, over 15% of the Company's electrical consumption comes from
renewable sources. Thanks to all of this, in 2015 Telefonica has been recognised by the Carbon

Telefonica, S.A. 252


--- Page 66 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

Disclosure Project, the best index of investment in climate change on a global level, as one of the
leading companies in its sector for managing energy and carbon.

e = Circular economy - The Company is committed to promoting a circular economy, in which goods
used are returned to the value chain. Thus, waste coming from Telefonica networks and customers,
with a particular focus on discarded electrical and electronic devices, are managed by authorised
entities, in compliance with environmental legislation and prioritising management in the following
order: reduce, reuse, and recycle. All companies in the group have waste management programmes
and recycling and/or reuse initiatives for managing customers’ devices.

e Green Services- in the current context, in which environmental and climate change challenges affect
society as a whole, Telefénica is developing services, mainly Machine to Machine (M2M) and the
Internet of Things (loT), aimed at reducing the consumption of resources and the environmental
impact of our customers. Telefonica is making a big play for the loT, it is estimated that it will
generate 11.000 million euros in 2025. According to current forecasts, the loT could reduce 200
million tonnes of CO2 emissions, approximately 23 % of the target set for 2030 by the European
Union. Telefonica wants to position itself therefore as a key actor in the green economy.

These actions have allowed Telefénica to extend its environmental responsibility to residential and
business customers and to continuously respond the the demands of responsible environmental
management from investors and shareholders.

Other aspects related to corporate social responsibility

Responsible business

Our customers, employees, investors, suppliers and society in general expect us to contribute to the
sustainable economic and social development of the countries in which we operate, and in order to
respond to these expectations, the aims of economic, social and environmental sustainability go hand in
hand with the strategic objectives of the Company itself.

We have made commitments to our different interest groups by means of our principles of Responsible
Business, in which we define the basic values which underpin all of our actions (we want to be an open,
challenging and reliable Company), the ethical principles which guide our way of doing business and our
specific commitments in the different areas for the Company. Compliance with the law at all times,
respect for human rights all across our value chain, assuming our fiscal responsibility and commitment to
the environment and social development are some of the principles which are reflected in this document.

Our specific sustainability objectives are set out in a Responsible Business Plan, which goes across all
Company departments and identifies the big challenges which we are setting ourselves regarding
sustainability. It is based on an analysis of the expectations of our customers, employees, investors and
suppliers, the regulator and the challenges facing society in general, as well as the Company strategy
itself and our risk map. The projects in the Plan include objectives regarding ethical behaviour, customer
promises, environmental impact and climate change, sustainable management of the supply chain,
digital trust and management of diversity and talent, and sustainable innovation.

Also, through Telefonica Digital Education and the Telefonica Foundations, we are pouring everything we
know about education, entrepreneurship and digital skills into a number of social projects aimed at
children, teenagers, parents and educators, in order to contribute to reducing the social gaps which
surround us.

We have updated our plan and our aims according to the expectations of our interest groups, taking
advantage of the many communication channels at our disposal. We have specific channels of
communication for employees, suppliers and other interest groups. We use different tools in order to
gather the views of our customers and society in general and we proactively promote conversations with
our investors.

The Responsible Business Plan has been approved by Telefénica's Administrative Board, along with the
strategy for participation and dialogue with our interest groups and the sustainability risk map, and there
is a copy in all operators in the group.

The Committee on Institutional Affairs is responsible for following up on the plan and the indicator control
panel. Each operator also has a Responsible Business Office, which represent the heads of all of the
business departments, which follows up on the plan and supervises the processes which have been
implemented to ensure the ethical and responsible conduct of the Company.

The Company's risk map is drawn up by the Company's auditing department and includes both financial
and non-financial risks - among others operational, technological, legal, social, environmental, political
and reputational - under the direct supervision of the Auditing Commission. The risk map not only
identifies and quantifies the relevant risks across the Company, but also the mitigation plans for said
risks.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Financing

In 2015, Telefonica's financing activity amounted approximately 18,001 million euros, excluding euro
commercial paper and short term banking loans, 26% of which were obtained through equity (shares and
hybrids) and the remaining amount as financial debt.

The financing activity was mainly focused on financing the GVT acquisition as well as on strengthening
the liquidity position, refinancing maturing debt and actively managing the cost of debt, through the
extension of the maturity of credit lines and the reduction of credit margins. The capital increases of
Telefénica, S.A., for a total of 3,048 million euros, and Telefénica Brasil, S.A. for a total of 16,107 million
Brazilian reais, were completed during the second quarter of 2015, and related mainly to the acquisition
of GVT. Approximately 25.2% of the capital increase of Telefénica Brasil, S.A. was subscribed by minority
shareholders (approximately 1,179 million euros).

The main financing transactions carried out in the bond market in 2015 are as follows:

Availability of funds

As of December 31, 2015, Telefénica’s liquidity, amounting to 19,143 million euros, includes: undrawn
committed credit facilities arranged with banks for an amount of 13,684 million euros (of which 12,497
million euros maturing in more than 12 months); and cash equivalents and current financial assets.

On February 19, 2015, Telefonica, S.A. signed a 2,500 million euros syndicated credit facility maturing in
2020, even though by mutual agreement between the parties could be extended to a maximum maturity
in 2022. On the same date, Telefonica S.A. signed an amendment to its 3,000 million euros syndicated
credit facility arranged on February 18, 2014 maturing in 2019 in which was included an option by mutual
agreement between the parties to extend the maturity up to 2021. On November 17, 2015, Telefonica,
S.A. signed a 3,000 million euros syndicated credit facility maturing in 2018. At December 31, 2015 there
was no outstanding amount under this facility. Therefore, with such last deal, in November 2015 the

liquidity has been increased and the company's gross debt maturities are fully covered until the end of
2016 with cash and credit lines available at December 31, 2015 and it is expected to be benefited from
other initiatives.

Additional information on sources of liquidity and undrawn lines of credit available to the Company, on
liquidity risk management, on the Company's debt levels, and on capital management is provided in
Notes 12, 13 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Contractual commitments

Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements provides information on firm commitments giving rise
to future cash outflows and associated with purchases and services received in relation to the Company's
principal activity, and any operating leases for buildings and assets related to the Company's activity,
primarily.

Credit risk management

The Telefonica Group considers commercial credit risk management as a key element to achieve its
sustainable business base growth targets in a manner that is consistent with Telefonica Corporate Risk
Management Policy. This management approach relies on the active monitoring of the risk-reward
balance in the commercial operations and the adequate separation between the risk ownership areas and
risk management areas.

Debtors that could cause a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements and
increased risk profile products — due to customer targets, term, channels or other commercial
characteristics - are subject to specific management practices in order to mitigate the exposure to credit
risk.

Uniform policies, procedures, delegation of authority and management practices are established in all
Group companies, taking into account benchmark risk management techniques but adapted to the local
characteristics of each market, including:

e Statistical and expert models for customer acquisition that are used to forecast and to manage
the expected probability of default of the transactions.

e Decision tools allowing the implementation of tailored credit strategies depending on products,
channels, geographies and types of customer.

¢ Continuous monitoring of the payment behavior and solvency of the customer portfolio.

e Internal and external collection processes designed to increase recovery through different
measures depending on debt age and the customer profile.

¢ Ongoing controls over the credit risk exposure performed by specific committees.

This commercial credit risk management model is embedded into the Group's decision-making processes,
especially from a day-to-day operating perspective, where the credit risk profile guides both the product
and services available for the different customers and the collections strategy.

Credit rating

At December 31, 2015, Telefonica, S.A.'s long-term issuer default rating is "BBB+/stable outlook" from
Fitch, “Baa2/stable outlook" from Moody's and "BBB/positive outlook" from Standard & Poor's. The most
recent updates on these ratings were issued by Fitch on June 26, 2015, Standard and Poor's on May 28,
2015 and Moody's on March 25, 2015. The changes in the long-term issuer default rating and outlook for
Telefonica, S.A. during 2015 were that Moody's revised the outlook to “stable” from “negative” on March
25, 2015 and Standard and Poor's revised the outlook to “positive” from “stable” on May 28, 2015.

Telefonica, S.A. 257

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

In 2015, among the measures taken to help to protect the credit rating, it is noteworthy the financing
activity together with a liquidity policy, the implementation of part of the dividend as a scrip dividend
(instead of cash only dividend) in the fourth quarter of 2015, a portfolio management through the
announced disposal of 02 UK , the rights issue to finance the GVT acquisition and the issuance of undated
deeply subordinated securities as a solvency protection measure to mitigate negative impacts on our
consolidated financial statements.

Dividend policy

Telefonica, S.A.'s dividend policy is revised yearly based on the Group's earnings, cash generation,
solvency, liquidity, flexibility to make strategic investments, and shareholder and investor expectations.
In 2015, the Annual General Meeting approved to pay a dividend, via scrip dividend of approximately 0.35
euros per share in November 2015, and the Board announced its intention to take corporate actions to
approve another cash dividend of 0.40 euros per share in the second quarter of 2016.

In November 2015, Telefonica launched a scrip dividend issue to allow shareholders to choose to receive
new shares in place of a cash dividend (which may be replaced by selling the associated subscription
rights to the Company at a pre-established price), while enabling the Company to reduce its debt,
depending on the take-up rate of the conversion.

Treasury shares

Telefonica has performed, and may consider performing, transactions with treasury shares and financial
instruments or contracts that confer the right to acquire treasury shares or assets whose underlying is
Company shares.

Treasury share transactions will always be for legitimate purposes, including:

e Undertaking treasury share acquisitions approved by the Board of Directors or pursuant to
General Shareholders’ Meeting resolutions.

e Honoring previous legitimate commitments assumed.

e Covering requirements for shares to allocate to employees and management under stock option
plans.

e Other purposes in accordance with prevailing legislation. In the past, treasury shares purchased
on the stock market were exchanged for other shares-securities (as in the case of preferred
capital securities), swapped for stakes in other companies (e.g. China Unicom, Telco S.p.A., or
Telef6nica Brasil, S.A.), or acquired to reduce the number of shares in circulation (by redeeming
the shares acquired), thereby boosting earnings per share.

Treasury share transactions will not be performed in any event based on privileged information or in
order to intervene in free price formation. In particular, any of the conduct referred to in Articles 83.ter.1
of the Spanish Securities Market Law and 2 of Royal Decree 1333/2005 of November 11 implementing
the Spanish Securities Market Law, with regards to market abuse will be avoided.

At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Telefonica, S.A. held the following treasury shares:

Treasury shares disposed of in 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounted to 593 million euros, 1 million euros and
1,423 million euros, respectively.

The main sale of treasury shares in 2015 was the exchange with Vivendi, S.A. of 46 million of Telefonica,
S.A.“s treasury shares, for 58.4 million preferred shares of Telefénica Brasil, S.A.. amounting to 555
million euros (see Note 5).

On June 30, 2015, the second phase of the Telefonica, S.A. long-term incentive plan called “Performance
and Investment Plan 2012-2015” (“PIP 2012-2015”) ended. According to the level of “Total Shareholder
Return” (TSR) achieved, 77%, 2,724,699 shares were delivered (see Note 19).

On July 24, 2015, pursuant to the resolutions adopted in the General Shareholders’ Meeting of June 12,
2015, capital was reduced by redeeming 74,076,263 treasury shares, thereby reducing this caption by
886 million euros.

The disposals of treasury shares in 2014 are mainly related to the shares delivered to Group employees
when the second phase of the Global Employee Share Plan (“the GESP”) matured (see Note 19).

At December 31, 2015, all the contracts of call option on treasury shares subject to physical delivery at a
fixed price have reached the maturity date or have been executed (76 million and 134 million options on
treasury shares at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively), which were presented as a reduction in
equity under the caption “Treasury shares”. They were valued, in previous periods, at the amount of
premium paid, and upon maturity if the call options were excercised the premium was reclassified as
traseury shares together with the price paid. If they were not exercised upon maturity their value was
recognized directly in equity.

The Company also has at December 31, 2015 a derivative financial instrument subject to net settlement
on a notional equivalent to 33.8 million Telefonica shares, recognized under “Current interest-bearing
debt” in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position (32 million and 30 million
equivalent shares in 2014 and 2013, respectively, recognized under the same caption).

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

Risks and uncertainties facing the company

The Telefénica Group's business is conditioned by a series of intrinsic risk factors that affect exclusively
the Group, as well as a series of external factors that are common to businesses of the same sector. The
main risks and uncertainties facing the Company which could affect its business, financial position,
reputation, corporate image and brand and its results of operations, must be considered jointly with the
information in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and are as follows:

Group-Related Risks

Worsening of the economic and political environment could negatively affect Telefénica's
business.

Telefonica’s international presence enables the diversification of its activities across countries and
regions, but it exposes Telefénica to various legislations, as well as to the political and economic
environments of the countries in which it operates. Any adverse developments or even uncertainties in
these countries, including exchange-rate or sovereign-risk fluctuations, may adversely affect the
business, financial position, cash flows and/or the performance of some or all of the Group's financial
indicators.

Economic conditions may adversely affect the level of demand of existing and prospective customers as
they may no longer deem critical the services offered by the Group.

Growth in Europe may be affected by political uncertainty in some European countries (including Spain),
a possible revival of the crisis in Greece, restructuring of the banking sector, the impact of steps taken
towards a EU banking union and a capital markets union and the referendum to be held in the near future
in the United Kingdom, among others. In 2015, the Telefénica Group obtained 26.3% of its revenues in
Spain and 16.7% in Germany.

In Latin America, higher exchange rate risks stand out after the large depreciation undergone by most
currencies in this region, affected by the fall in commodity prices, the uncertainties about growth in
China, and the interest rate evolution in the United States, among other macroeconomic factors. Abrupt
exchange rate movements could especially be triggered by scenarios characterized by high inflation and
fiscal and external deficits. In this regard, it should be noted that the Venezuelan bolivar exchange rate
quoted in SIMADI has remained stable for a year despite the high increase in prices accumulated over this
period, increasing the risk of readjustment. In addition, the Argentine peso (which already experienced a
sharp depreciation in December 2015) is experiencing some depth constraints in its trading market, and
the Brazilian real (which also experienced a depreciation in 2015) has remained volatile at the beginning
of 2016. Cash flows from countries in this region could decrease, and financial conditions could become
more unfavorable if any of these elements were to worsen in the future.

Some of the most significant macroeconomic risk factors in the region affect Brazil, where there is a
combination of high inflation, negative economic growth rates and significant internal and external
financing needs. All these elements have led to new downgrades to the country’s credit rating.

Moreover, the recent fall in oil prices and other commodity prices is having a negative impact on the
external and fiscal accounts in Chile, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, and Ecuador (which has a dollarized
economy, and is currently experiencing a lower supply of U.S. dollars).

In Argentina, the new government is focused on resolving Argentina's macroeconomic and financial
imbalances and on recovering international confidence. Although reforms taking place may have positive
effects in the medium term, short term risks persist.

In Venezuela after the parliamentary elections in which the Democratic Unity Roundtable (an opposition
coalition to the ruling United Social Party of Venezuela) claimed the majority of seats in the National
Assembly, a new economic emergency decree was announced which could increase state control on
private businesses. In addition, there continues to be very limited access to U.S. dollars.

Telefonica, S.A. 261

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended December 31, 2015, Telefénica Hispanoamérica and Telefonica Brazil represented
30.5% and 23.4% of the Telefonica Group's revenues, respectively. Moreover, approximately 35.6% of
the Group's revenues in the telephony business were generated in countries that do not have investment
grade status (in order of importance Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Costa Rica), and other countries are only one notch away from losing this threshold. At
December 31, 2015 the percentage of Telefénica's net financial debt in Latin American currencies stood
at 13%.

“Country risk” factors include the following, among others:

. unexpected adverse changes in regulation or administrative policies, including changes
that modify the terms and conditions of licenses and concessions and their renewal (or
delay their approval);

. abrupt exchange rate movements;

e expropriation or nationalization of assets, adverse tax decisions, or other forms of state
intervention;

. economic-financial downturns, political instability and civil disturbances; and

. maximum limits on profit margins imposed in order to limit the prices of goods and

services through the analysis of cost structures (for example, in Venezuela, a maximum
profit margin has been introduced that will be set annually by the Superintendence for
Defense of Socioeconomic Rights).

Any of the foregoing may adversely affect the business, financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the Group.

The Group's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if it does not
effectively manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates or financial
investment risks.

At December 31, 2015, 49.1% of the Group’s net debt was pegged to fixed interest rates for a period
greater than one year, while 28% was denominated in a currency other than the euro.

To illustrate the sensitivity of financial expenses to a change in short-term interest rates at December 31,
2015: (i) a 100 basis points increase in interest rates in all currencies in which Telefonica has a financial
position at that date would lead to an increase in financial expenses of 245 million euros, (ii) whereas a
100 basis points decrease in interest rates in all currencies except the euro, the U.S. dollar and the pound
sterling (these to zero rates in order to avoid negative rates), would lead to a reduction in financial
expenses of 75 million euros. These calculations were made assuming a constant currency and a balance
position equivalent to the position at that date and bearing in mind the derivative financial instruments
arranged.

According to the Group's calculations, the impact on net financial expense by changes in the value of a
10% depreciation of Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar and a 10% depreciation of the rest
of the currencies against the euro would result in exchange losses of 33 million euros, primarily due to the
weakening of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the Argentine peso. These calculations were made
assuming a constant currency position with an impact on profit or loss at December 31, 2015, including
derivative instruments in place. At December 31, 2015, 31.3% of the Telefonica Group's operating
income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) was concentrated in Telefonica Brazil and 38.2% in
Telefonica Hispanoamérica.

The Telefonica Group uses a variety of strategies to manage these risks, mainly through the use of
financial derivatives, which themselves also expose us to risk, including counterparty risk. Furthermore,
the Group's risk management strategies may not achieve the desired effect, which could adversely affect
the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Telefonica, S.A. 262


--- Page 76 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

Existing or worsening conditions in the financial markets may limit the Group's ability to finance,
and consequently, the ability to carry out its business plan.

The performance, expansion and improvement of the Telefonica Group's networks, the development and
distribution of the Telefénica Group's services and products, the development and implementation of
Telefénica's strategic plan and new technologies, the renewal of licenses or the expansion of the
Telefonica Group's business in countries where it operates, may require a substantial amount of
financing.

A decrease in the liquidity of the Company, a difficulty in refinancing maturing debt or raising new funds
as debt or equity, could force Telefénica to use resources allocated to investments or other commitments
to pay its financial debt, which could have a negative effect on the Group's business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

Funding could be more difficult and costly in the event of a significant deterioration of conditions in the
international or local financial markets (especially considering the recent volatility resulting from
uncertainties regarding China, the decline in commodity prices and the hikes in interest rates approved
by the Federal Reserve, all of which impact Latin America), or if there is an eventual deterioration in the
solvency or operating performance of the Company, or if Telefonica’s divestment of its operations in the
United Kingdom were to not be completed, or as a consequence of a credit rating downgrade of Spanish
sovereign risk by rating agencies.

At December 31, 2015, gross financial debt scheduled to mature in 2016 amounted to 11,275 million
euros (which includes the net position of derivative financial instruments and certain current payables),
and gross financial debt scheduled to mature in 2017 amounted to 8,461 million euros.

In accordance with its liquidity policy, the Company has fully covered its gross debt maturities until the
end of 2016 with cash and credit lines available at December 31, 2015, including a syndicated credit
facility signed in November 2015 with several national and foreign institutions amounting to 3,000
million euros with a maturity of up to 27 months. Our liquidity could be affected if Telefénica’s
divestment of its operations in the United Kingdom is finally not consummated, or if market conditions
make it difficult to renew existing undrawn credit lines, 8.7% of which, at December 31, 2015, were
scheduled to mature prior to December 31, 2016.

In addition, given the interrelation between economic growth and financial stability, the materialization of
any of the economic, political and exchange rate risks referred to above could lead to a negative impact
on the availability and cost of Telefonica's financing and its liquidity strategy; which could have, as well, a
negative effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Telefénica’s divestment of its operations in the United Kingdom may not materialize.

On March 24, 2015, Telefonica and Hutchison signed an agreement for the acquisition by the latter of
Telefénica's operations in the UK (02 UK) for a price (firm value) of 10,250 million pounds sterling in cash
(approximately 14,000 million euros at the exchange rate as of the date of the agreement), composed of
(i) an initial amount of 9,250 million pounds sterling (approximately 12,640 million euros as of the date of
the agreement) which would be paid at closing and (ii) an additional deferred payment of 1,000 million
pounds sterling (approximately 1,360 million euros) to be paid once the cumulative cash flow of the
combined company in the United Kingdom has reached an agreed threshold.

Completion of the transaction is subject to, among other conditions, the approval of the European
Commission and the obtainment of waivers to some contractual provisions affected by the sale, including
those related to network alliances, as well as change of control provisions under certain contractual
arrangements with third parties. As of the date of the issuance of these Financial Consolidated
Statements, such conditions had not been met. The European Commission authorization process is
ongoing.

As completion of the share purchase agreement is conditional on the satisfaction (or, if applicable,
waiver) of certain conditions, the acquisition may or may not proceed. If the abovementioned divestment

Telefonica, S.A. 263


--- Page 77 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

is ultimately not consummated, or it is consummated under conditions other than those initially
reported, this could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of Telefénica’s ordinary shares,
bonds and financial instruments, and its leverage.

Risks Relating to the Group's Industry

The Group operates in a highly regulated industry which requires government concessions for the
provision of a large part of its services and the use of spectrum, which is a scarce and costly
resource.

The telecommunications sector is subject to laws and regulations in different countries, and additionally,
many of the services the Group provides require the granting of a license, concession or official approval,
which usually requires certain obligations and investments to be made, such as those relating to
spectrum availability. Among the main risks of this nature are those related to spectrum regulation and
licenses/concessions, rates, Universal Service regulation, regulated wholesale services over fiber
networks, privacy, functional separation of businesses and network neutrality.

Thus, as the Group provides most of its services under licenses, authorizations or concessions, it is
vulnerable to administrative bodies’ decisions, such as economic fines for serious breaches in the
provision of services and, potentially, revocation or failure to renew these licenses, authorizations or
concessions, or the granting of new licenses to competitors for the provisions of services in a specific
market.

In this regard, the Telefonica Group pursues its license renewals in the terms referred in their respective
contractual conditions, though it cannot guarantee that it will always complete this process successfully
or under the most beneficial terms for the Group. In many cases complying with certain obligations is
required, including, among others, minimum specified quality, service and coverage standards and capital
investment. Failure to comply with these obligations could result in the imposition of fines, revision of the
contractual terms, or even the revocation of the license, authorization or concession. Additionally, the
Telefonica Group could be affected by regulatory actions carried out by the antitrust authorities. These
authorities could prohibit certain actions, such as new acquisitions or specific practices, create obligations
or lead to heavy fines. Any such measures implemented by the competition authorities could result in
economic and/or reputational loss for the Group, in addition to a loss of market share and/or harm to the
future growth of certain businesses.

Moreover, the fact that the Group's business is highly regulated both affects its revenues and imposes
costs on its operations. For example, regulations fix the rates that Telefonica charges for calls received
from other companies’ networks, and regulators have progressively lowered these rates in recent years.
In addition, and particularly in Spain, regulators have promoted competition in recent years by, for
example, adopting policies which allow alternative operators access to Telefénica'’s networks. This
intense competition has exerted downward pressure on Telefonica’s tariff structure, adversely affecting
revenues, and led to increased commercial expenses, adversely affecting margins.

Regulation of spectrum and government licenses

Further to the European Commission's new “Digital Single Market” (DSM) Strategy, Europe is expected to
undergo an important review of its regulatory framework. The new European DSM Strategy comprises a
series of policy initiatives to promote the development of the single market of digital services and
networks. As a result, the European Commission will initiate legislative processes, which could have
significant implications on access to network, spectrum use, auction conditions, duration and renewal of
licenses, audiovisual services and platforms, among other various matters.

On May 8, 2015, the European Commission approved a Decision on the harmonization of the 1452 - 1492
MHz frequency band (1500 MHz band), which encourages Member States to designate and to make
available this band frequency from November 2015, on a non-exclusive basis. As a result, new spectrum
award processes are expected in the short and mid-term all across the EU. Germany and the United
Kingdom have already auctioned the band frequency and therefore the Decision will not have a material

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

impact on Telefénica's cash flow in those markets. In Spain, the Government launched a consultation
which ended on June 21, 2015 to evaluate demand for spectrum in the 1500 MHz band. The tender of the
1500 MHz band in Spain may take place during 2016.

Additionally, the main terms of the allocation and use of the 700 MHz band in Europe is expected to be
decided in the coming months. This could require new cash outflows from Telefonica between 2018 and
2021 (the period over which it is expected that the spectrum will be available), except in Germany which
was the first country in Europe to award spectrum in the 700 MHz band, together with the 1800 MHz, 900
MHz and 1500 MHz bands.

Further, in Germany, on July 4, 2014 and September 25, 2015, the German Federal Network Agency
(BnetzA) adopted decisions concerning the impact of Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG merger with E-
Plus Mobilfunk GmbH & Co. KG (E-Plus) on the spectrum held by Telefonica Deutschland (the surviving
entity after the merger). BnetzA has required Telefénica Deutschland to terminate by June 30, 2016
(rather than December 31, 2016) some rights of use with respect to spectrum in the 1800 MHz band that
was not reacquired by Telefonica Deutschland at the abovementioned auction proceeding. The remaining
1800 MHz spectrum band that was not reacquired in such auction was returned at the end of 2015. The
German regulator also announced that it will perform a frequency distribution analysis, and determine
whether any additional action is needed, particularly in the area of the 2 GHz spectrum band granted to
Telefonica Deutschland.

United Internet and the regional cable operator Airdata have filed complaints against the EU General
Court decision allowing the merger between Telefénica Deutschland Holding AG and E-Plus Mobilfunk
GmbH & Co. Telefonica Deutschland has been accepted as an interested party in these proceedings.

In the United Kingdom, licenses were amended in January 2015 to introduce a 90% geographic coverage
obligation for voice and text services. Separately, on September 24, 2015, the telecommunication
regulator (Ofcom) issued a decision to increase the annual fees which mobile operators must pay for the
use of 900 MHz and 1800 MHz spectrum. Accordingly, from October 31, 2015, the annual charge that
Telefonica UK must pay is 32.2 million pounds sterling (increased from 15.6 million pounds sterling),
rising to 48.7 million pounds sterling plus CPI from October 31, 2016. Finally, following consultation, on
December 3, 2015 Ofcom published an update stating that it has decided to initiate an auction procedure
to award 2.3 GHz and 3.4 GHz spectrum once decisions have been made by the relevant competition
authorities, in relation to the proposed merger between Telefonica UK Limited and Hutchison 3G UK
Limited.

In Latin America, spectrum auctions are expected to take place implying potential cash outflows to obtain
additional spectrum or to meet the coverage requirements associated with these licenses. Specifically,
the procedures expected to take place in 2016 are:

e Peru: In August 2015, the government published the conditions for granting licenses in the 700
MHz spectrum band (three blocks of 2x15 MHz have been defined). On November 4, 2015
Telefonica was declared as a prequalified bidder.

e Costa Rica: In December 2015, the Government communicated its intention to auction 40 MHz in
the 1800 MHz band and 30 MHz in the 1900/2100 MHz band during 2016.

e Mexico: The Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) has proposed to auction spectrum in the
2500 MHz band in 2016. In addition, and in light of the constitutional reform resulting from the
"Pact for Mexico" political initiative, a wholesale network offering services in the 700 MHz band
will be created under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). On January 29, 2016, the SCT
(Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes) published the rules for the International
Competitive Tender. The rules state that the contract will be awarded in August 2016 and
commercial operations must begin no later than March 31, 2018.

e Panama: On December 4, 2015, the process of reallocation of the AWS band (140 MHz, 1710-
1780 / 2110-2180 MHz) was announced. It is expected to start by the end of 2016.

Telefonica, S.A. 265

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

e Uruguay: The Government approved a resolution allowing for a spectrum auction for mobile
services. The auction will contain 15 + 15 MHz in the “AWS Ext” spectrum band and 45 + 45 MHz
in the 700 MHz spectrum band (20 + 20 MHz of the 45 + 45 MHz in 700 MHz were previously
reserved for the National Telecommunications Administration, ANTEL). As of the date of this
report, this process has been delayed and the bidding rules for spectrum have not yet been
published.

¢ Colombia: The regulator has published a consultation document for comment which analyzes
alternatives and other considerations regarding the structuring of the allocation process for radio
spectrum in the 700 MHz bands (which is part of the “Digital dividend”, which is the set of
frequencies that have been available to mobile communications services in the frequency bands
traditionally used for television broadcast (700 MHz and 800 MHz) due to the migration from
analogue TV to digital TV), 900 MHz, 1,900 MHz and 2,500 MHz for mobile services. The first
auction is expected to take place in 2016. Colombia has established spectrum caps for lower
bands, which are currently set at 30 MHz, and Telefonica has 25 MHz in lower bands.

e Venezuela: The regulator has indicated the possibility of awarding spectrum in the 2600 MHz
band (20 + 20 MHz) for 4G services, in the 1900 MHz band (5 + 5 MHz) for 3G services and in the
900 MHz band during 2016.

In December 2015, the Brazilian regulatory authority (Agencia Nacional de Telecomunicagdes or
ANATEL) auctioned the spectrum lots remaining in the 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, 2500 MHz and 3500 MHz
bands, where Telefonica acquired seven lots of 2.5 GHz frequency band. These lots are associated to six
different States, five of them in the capital cities of the States of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre,
Florianapolis, and Palmas and one in an interior city of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. Such frequencies
will be used for provision of mobile broadband service on 4G.

Further to the above, certain administrations may not have announced their intention to release new
spectrum and may do so during the year. The above does not include processes announced via general
statements by administrations, which involve bands not key to Telefonica's needs. Telefonica may also
seek to acquire spectrum on the secondary market where opportunities might arise.

Risks relating to concessions and licenses previously granted

In the state of Sao Paulo, Telefonica Brazil provides local and national long-distance Commuted Fixed
Telephony Service ("CFTS") under the public regime, through a concession agreement, which will be in
force until 2025. In accordance with current regulations, Telefonica Brazil informed ANATEL that the net
value as of December 31, 2015 of assets assigned to the provision of the CFTS (which include, among
others, switching and transmission equipment and public use terminals, external network equipment,
energy equipment and system and operation support equipment) were estimated to total 7,856 million
Brazilian reais. In principle, the assets assigned to the provision of the CFTS are considered reversible
assets; the scope of such reversibility is subject to a complex debate at different instances.

On June 27, 2014, as established in the concession agreement, ANATEL issued a public consultation for
the revision of the concession agreement. Although definitive conditions (which might deal, among
others, with the reversibility of assets, universalization goals and, in general, the obligational regime of
the concessionaire) were to be published in 2015, such publication was postponed until April 2016. In
addition, current reversibility regulations will be reviewed by ANATEL, which is expected to issue a public
consultation in the near future. Definitive regulations might be issued in the second half of 2016. We
cannot assure that changes made to the concession terms or to the reversibility regulations will not be
detrimental to Telefénica’s interests.

In Colombia, the ICT Ministry issued Resolution 597 on March 27, 2014, to renew 850 MHz/1900 MHz
licenses for 10 additional years. The reversion of assets (other than radio frequencies, which is clear that
must be returned) and its scope, has been discussed in the context of the liquidation of the concession
contract, taking into consideration the terms of the contract, and the Constitutional Court's review of Law
422 of 1998, and Law 1341 of 2009. Discussions on the matter concluded on February 16, 2016. The ITC

Telefonica, S.A. 266

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

Ministry has announced that it is going to convene the Arbitral Tribunal, in accordance with what was
agreed upon in the concession contract. To date, the content of the claim is unknown.

In Peru, the concessions for the provision of the fixed-line service will remain in force until November
2027. However, the Company filed a partial renewal request for five more years in December 2013. As of
the date of this Annual Report, the decision of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (Ministerio
de Transportes y Comunicaciones) is still pending.

Telefonica Méviles Chile, S.A. was awarded spectrum on the 700 MHz (2x10 MHz) band in March 2014.
The claim brought by a consumer organization against 700 MHz assignments was rejected by the Court
of Defense of Free Competition in a judgment of July 24, 2015 and the appeal before the Hon. Supreme
Court submitted by the consumer organization is still awaiting resolution.

In El Salvador, the process of renewal of the Group's licenses, which expires in 2018, has been postponed.

In Ecuador, once the Group’s concession for mobile services expires in 2023, the renewal of such
concession or the granting of a new concession will be subject to negotiation with the Government. If the
Group fails to renew such concession or obtain a new concession, assets assigned to the provision of
mobile services will revert to the State in exchange for a fee.

The Group's consolidated investment in spectrum acquisitions and renewals in 2015 amounted to 1,585
million euros.

The Group's failure to obtain sufficient or appropriate spectrum capacity in the jurisdictions discussed
above or any others in which it operates or its inability to assume the related costs, could have an adverse
impact on its ability to launch and provide new services and on Telefénica's ability to maintain the quality
of existing services, which may adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Regulation of wholesale and retail charges

The European Regulation 2015/2120 on Net Neutrality and Roaming was adopted on November 25,
2015. Under this regulation, from April 30, 2016, when its implementation becomes effective, until June
15, 2017 operators may charge users roaming within the EU an additional fee on their domestic prices for
roaming calls, SMS and data services, subject to certain regulated limits. In particular, the surcharges
allowed during this period are 0.05 euro/minute for calls, 0.02 euro per SMS sent and 0.05 euro per
megabits data (excluding VAT). During this period, the sum of the domestic retail price and any such
surcharge shall not exceed 0.19 euro/minute for calls, 0.06 euro per SMS sent and 0.20 euro per megabits
data. However, surcharges will not be permitted from June 15, 2017 onwards. The impact of this measure
is very difficult to quantify because it will depend on the elasticity of traffic to decreases in the rates
charged.

The decreases in wholesale mobile network termination rates (MTR) in Europe are also noteworthy. In
the United Kingdom, wholesale MTRs have been reduced to 0.680 ppm (pence/minute) from May 1,
2015 (representing a 19.5% reduction compared to the previous rates). Further cuts of 26.3% and 3.1%
(in real terms) will come into effect in April 1, 2016, and April 1, 2017, respectively. However, the impact
of these decreases in the Group's results will be diminished if the proposed sale of our operations in the
United Kingdom to Hutchison is completed on a timely basis.

In Germany, on April 24, 2015, BNetzA adopted its final decisions to reduce MTRs. The new prices will
gradually decrease from 0.0172 euro/minute to 0.0166 euro/minute from December 1, 2015 until the
end of November 2016. The European Commission had beforehand requested that the German regulator
withdraw or amend the proposal of such decision. Because BNetzA did not apply the “Pure LRIC (Long
Run Incremental Cost Model)” approach recommended by the European Commission, there is a risk that
the Commission will initiate infringement proceedings against Germany, and rates may be further
reduced.

In Spain, the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (Comisi6n Nacional de los Mercados
y la Competencia or CNMC) has initiated the process of reviewing the prices of mobile termination, with a
final decision expected to be adopted in the second half of 2016. Additionally, in May 2015, the CNMC
launched a public consultation on the analysis of the market for access and call origination on fixed
networks. The CNMC proposes to maintain the obligation of Telefonica to provide a wholesale
interconnection offer (RIO) and a wholesale offer of access to the fixed telephone line (WLR), both with
cost-oriented prices. The final decision is expected to be issued during the first half of 2016.

In Latin America, it is likely that MTRs are also reduced in the short to medium term. For example, in
Mexico, on October 1, 2015, the IFT adopted the MTR for 2016. The MTR was set at 0.1869 Mexican
pesos per minute in consistency with the Pure LRIC model. The previous MTR was set at 0.2505 pesos per
minute.

Telefonica has appealed this decision as well as other decisions concerning the MTR applicable from 2011
to 2015.

In Brazil, ANATEL has been issuing ex-ante regulations to ensure competition in the wholesale market
which includes reductions of the MTR. In this regard, the “Plano Geral de Metas de Competicao (PGMC),
as amended by Resolution 649/2015, established that mobile termination fees are subject to successive
yearly reductions from 2016 until 2019, when the definitive cost-oriented-model fees shall be in force
(such Resolution has been challenged in courts without a definitive outcome).

In Argentina, the new legal framework "Argentina Digital" provides the new regulator the possibility to
regulate the tariffs and prices of essential public services, wholesale services and those the regulator
determines based on reasons of public interest, on which the law does not set parameters. As a result,
there may be a negative impact, depending on how the new regulator exercises its powers. In addition,
until the Secretary of Communications determines that there is effective competition for
telecommunications services, the "dominant" providers in the relevant areas (which include Telefonica de
Argentina) must respect the maximum tariffs established in the general tariff structure.

Regulation of Universal Services

In September 2015, as a part of the DSM Strategy, the European Commission issued a public consultation
on the review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, including certain aspects of
the Universal Service obligations. Depending on the outcome of this public consultation, the European
Commission could initiate a legislative process including both the potential inclusion of certain broadband
speeds in its scope and a possible reduction of some of the current Universal Service obligations that are
becoming obsolete. Depending on the terms that will be set forth in the new regulation, implementation
at a local level could lead to higher costs for both the Universal Service provider and the operators forced
to finance the Universal Service.

In Spain, the licenses of Telefonica de Espafia and Telefonica Telecomunicaciones Publicas (which owns
public terminals) for the provision of Universal Services will expire on December 31, 2016. As from this
date, there will be a new tender for the award of the provision of the Universal Services.

Regulation of fiber networks

On November 18, 2015 the Spanish CNMC adopted a Draft Resolution on the wholesale broadband
market regulation, which foresees a geographical segmentation in competitive and non-competitive
areas. This draft Resolution was approved by the European Commission on December 18, 2015. The new
resulting regulation, which will apply to NGA (Next Generation Access Networks), could be approved in
the first quarter of 2016 and will presumably last for at least three years. Its implementation is expected
to result in an increase, of the current regulatory obligations of Telefonica in Spain, in terms of its
granting of access to other operators to its fiber network and with respect to certain aspects relating
specifically to the business segment.

Regulations on privacy

In Europe, a political agreement between the Council and the European Parliament was reached on
December 15, 2015, on the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection
Directive. Formal adoption of such regulation by both the Council and the Parliament is expected to take
place in spring 2016. The GDPR would become effective two years thereafter, by spring 2018. Some of
the critical provisions of this new Regulation will make tougher the launch of new services focused on the
processing of personal data. In addition, the GDPR will introduce administrative fines of up to 4% of an
undertaking’s annual global turnover for breaching the new data protection rules.

In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared invalid the Decision of the European
Commission’ of July 26, 2002, known as the “Safe Harbor Agreement”, relating to the transfer of
personal data from the EU to the United States. Since November 2015, EU and US Authorities have been
negotiating a new agreement that ensures a level of protection similar to that provided by the EU. Failure
to reach this agreement would create difficulties in the provision of services which involve the flow of EU
citizens’ personal data to the US.

In Brazil, it is expected, in the near future, that the Personal Data Protection Act will be adopted. This
could lead to further obligations and restrictions for operators in relation to the collection of personal
data and its treatment. In Peru, on May 8, 2015, the new Personal Data Protection Law came into force.
The adoption of secondary legislation is still pending. In Ecuador, the Telecommunications Act (Ley
Organica de Telecomunicaciones), adopted in February 2015, devotes a whole chapter to regulate the use
of personal data.

Regulation of functional separation

The principles established in Europe's common regulatory framework, adopted in 2009 and transposed in
the national legislation of each Member State in which Telefonica operates could result in greater
regulatory pressure on the local competitive environment. Specifically, this framework supports the
possibility of national regulators (in specific cases and under exceptional conditions) forcing operators
with significant market power and vertically-integrated operators to separate their wholesale and retail
businesses at a functional level. They would therefore be required to offer equal wholesale terms to third-
party operators that acquire these products.

Regulation of network neutrality”

As mentioned above, the European Regulation 2015/2120 on Net Neutrality and Roaming was adopted
on November 25, 2015. The regulation will enter into force on April 30, 2016. The application of the
Regulation could directly affect possible future business models of Telefonica and may affect the
network management or differentiation of characteristics and quality of Internet access service.

Telefonica operates in Latin American countries where net neutrality has already been ruled, such as
Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Peru, where Osiptel published on September 8, 2015 the
Draft Regulation on Net Neutrality. In Brazil, the Secretariat of Legislative Matters of the Ministry of
Justice is concluding a proposal on Net Neutrality Regulation.

If changes to regulation such as those described above, or otherwise, occur in the various jurisdictions
where the Telefonica Group operates, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

* Commission Decision 2000/520/EC, of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related
frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce.

7 In general terms, it is a principle applicable to the field of Internet networks, for which operators may not place
restrictions on the terminals that can be connected or the services, applications and content that can be distributed.
It also refers to non-discrimination by operators between different types of traffic circulating through their networks.

Telefonica, S.A. 269

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

The Telefénica Group is exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and
regulations and economic sanctions programs.

The Telefonica Group is required to comply with the laws and regulations of various jurisdictions where it
conducts operations. In particular, the Group's international operations are subject to various anti-
corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery
Act of 2010, and economic sanction programs, including those administered by the United Nations, the
European Union and the United States, including the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets
Control. The anti-corruption laws generally prohibit providing anything of value to government officials
for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. As part
of the Telefonica Group's business, it may deal with entities, the employees of which are considered
government officials. In addition, economic sanctions programs restrict the Group's business dealings
with certain sanctioned countries, individuals and entities.

Although the Group has internal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable
anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies and
procedures will be sufficient or that the Group's employees, directors, officers, partners, agents and
service providers will not take actions in violation of the Group's policies and procedures (or otherwise in
violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations) for which the Group or they may
be ultimately held responsible. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations could lead to
financial penalties, exclusion from government contracts, damage to our reputation and other
consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations
and financial condition.

As at the date of this report, Telefonica is currently conducting an internal investigation regarding
possible violations of applicable anti-corruption laws. Telefénica has been in contact with governmental
authorities about this matter and intends to cooperate with those authorities as the investigation
continues. It is not possible at this time to predict the scope or duration of this matter or its likely
outcome.

Customers' perceptions of services offered by the Company may put it at a disadvantage
compared to competitors' offerings.

Customers’ perceptions of the assistance and services offered are critical to operating in highly-
competitive markets. The ability to predict and respond to the changing needs and demands of
customers affects the Company's competitive position relative to other technology sector companies,
and its ability to extract the value generated during this process of transformation. Failure to do so
adequately could have an adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

The Company may not be able to adequately foresee and respond to technological changes and
sector trends.

In a sector characterized by rapid technological change, it is essential to be able to offer the products and
services demanded by the market and consider the impacts of changes in the life cycle of technical
assets, secure margins and select the right investments to make.

The Telefonica Group operates in markets that are highly competitive and subject to constant
technological development. Therefore, as a consequence of both of these characteristics, it is subject to
the effects of actions by competitors in these markets and to its ability to anticipate and adapt, in a
timely manner, to constant technological changes, changes in customer preferences that are taking place
in the industry, as well as economic, political and social circumstances.

Failure to do so adequately could have an adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

New products and technologies arise constantly, and their development can render obsolete the products
and services the Telefénica Group offers and the technology it uses. This means that Telefonica must

Telefonica, S.A. 270


--- Page 84 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

invest in the development of new products, technology and services so it can continue to compete
effectively with current or future competitors, which may result in the decrease of the Group's profits and
revenue margins. In this respect, margins from traditional voice and data business are shrinking, while
new sources of revenues are deriving from mobile Internet and connectivity services that are being
launched. Research and development costs amounted to 1,012 million euros in 2015, representing a
decrease of 0.9% from 1,021 million euros in 2014 (959 million euros in 2013). These expenses
represented 2.1%, 2.3% and 1.9% of the Group’s consolidated revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. These figures have been calculated using the guidelines established in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) manual. One technology that telecommunications
operators, including Telefonica (in Spain and Latin America), are focused on is the new FTTx-type
network, which offers broadband access using optical fiber with superior services, such as Internet speed
of up to 1O0MB or HD television services. However, substantial investment is required to deploy these
networks, which entails fully or partially substituting copper loop access with optic fiber. While an
increasing demand for the capabilities offered by these new networks to end users exists, the high level
of the investments requires a continuous analysis of the return on investment.

The explosion of the digital market and entry of new players in the communications market, such as
MVNOs, Internet companies or device manufacturers, may cause the loss of value of certain assets, and
affect the Group's ability to generate income. Therefore, it is necessary to update the business model,
encouraging the pursuit of incomes and additional efficiencies to those followed traditionally. Failure to
do so adequately could have an adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

In addition, the ability of the Telefonica Group's IT systems (operational and backup) to respond the
Company's operating requirements is a key factor to be taken into account with respect to the
commercial development, customer satisfaction and business efficiency.

The Company depends on its suppliers.

The existence of critical suppliers in the supply chain, especially in areas such as network infrastructure,
information systems or handsets, with a high concentration in a small number of suppliers, poses risks
that may affect the Company's operations, and may cause legal contingencies or damages to the
Company's image in the event that inappropriate practices are produced by a participant in the supply
chain.

As of December 31, 2015, the Telefonica Group depended on five handset suppliers and 13 network
infrastructure suppliers, which together accounted for 80% of the awarded contracts for the year then
ended. These suppliers may, among other things, extend delivery times, raise prices and limit supply due
to their own stock shortfalls and business requirements.

If these suppliers fail to deliver products and services to the Telefonica Group on a timely basis, it could
jeopardize network deployment and expansion plans, which in some cases could adversely affect the
Telefonica Group's ability to satisfy its license terms and requirements, or otherwise have an adverse
impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Unanticipated network interruptions can lead to quality loss or the interruption of the service.

Unanticipated network interruptions as a result of system failures, including those due to network,
hardware or software, stealing of infrastructure elements or cyber-attacks, which affect the quality of or
cause an interruption in the Telefonica Group's service, could lead to customer dissatisfaction, reduced
revenues and traffic, costly repairs, penalties or other measures imposed by regulatory authorities and
could harm the Telefonica Group's image and reputation.

Telecommunications companies worldwide face increasing cybersecurity threats as businesses become
increasingly dependent on telecommunications and computer networks and adopt cloud computing
technologies. Cybersecurity threats include gaining unauthorized access to our systems or inserting
computer viruses or malicious software in our systems to misappropriate consumer data and other

Telefonica, S.A. 271


--- Page 85 ---

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

sensitive information, corrupt our data or disrupt our operations. Unauthorized access may also be gained
through traditional means such as the theft of laptop computers, portable data devices and mobile
phones and intelligence gathering on employees with access.

Telefonica attempts to mitigate these risks through a number of measures, including backup systems
and protective systems such as firewalls, virus scanners and other physical and logical security. However,
these measures are not always effective. Although the Telefonica Group has insurance policies to cover
these types of incidents, and the claims and loss in revenue caused by service interruptions to date have
been covered by these policies, these policies may not be sufficient to cover all possible monetary losses.

The telecommunications industry may be affected by the possible effects that electromagnetic
fields, emitted by mobile devices and base stations, may have on human health.

In some countries, there is a concern regarding potential effects of electromagnetic fields, emitted by
mobile devices and base stations, on human health. This public concern has caused certain governments
and administrations to take measures that have hindered the deployment of the infrastructures
necessary to ensure quality of service, and affected the deployment criteria of new networks and digital
services such as smart meters development.

There is a consensus between certain expert groups and public health agencies, including the World
Health Organization (WHO), that states that currently there are no established risks associated with
exposure to low frequency signals in mobile communications. However, the scientific community is still
investigating this issue especially with respect to mobile devices. Exposure limits for radio frequency
suggested in the guidelines of the Protection of Non-lonizing Radiation Protection Committee (ICNIRP)
have been internationally recognized. The mobile industry has adopted these exposure limits and works
to request authorities worldwide to adopt these standards.

Worries about radio frequency emissions may discourage the use of mobile devices and new digital
services, which could cause the public authorities to implement measures restricting where transmitters
and cell sites can be located, how they operate, the use of mobile telephones and the massive
deployment of smart meters and other products using mobile technology. This could lead to the
Company being unable to expand or improve its mobile network.

The adoption of new measures by governments or administrations or other regulatory interventions in
this respect, and any future assessment on the adverse impact of electromagnetic fields on health, may
negatively affect the business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows of the Telefonica
Group.

Possible regulatory, business, economic or political changes could lead to asset impairment.

The Telefonica Group reviews on an annual basis, or more frequently when the circumstances require it,
the value of assets and cash-generating units, to assess whether their carrying values can be supported
by the future expected cash flows, including, in some cases synergies allowed for in acquisition costs.
Potential changes in the regulatory, business, economic or political environment may result in the need
to introduce changes to estimates made and to recognize impairment in goodwill, intangible assets or
fixed assets. Although the recognition of impairments of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets
and financial assets results in a non-cash charge on the income statement, it could adversely affect the
results of the Telefonica Group's operations. In this respect, the Telefonica Group has experienced
impairments on certain of its investments, affecting its results of operations in the year in which they
were experienced. For example, with respect to the investment in Telco, S.p.A. (Telco), value adjustments
were made in 2014 with a negative impact of 464 million euros.

The Telefonica Group's networks carry and store large volumes of confidential, personal and
corporate data, and its Internet access and hosting services may lead to claims for illegal or illici
use of the Internet.

The Telefénica Group's networks carry and store large volumes of confidential, personal and business
data, through both voice and data traffic. The Telefonica Group stores increasing quantities and types of

Telefonica, S.A. 272

Telefonica 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements

customer data in both business and consumer segments. Despite its best efforts to prevent it, the
Telefonica Group may be found liable for any loss, transfer, or inappropriate modification of the customer
data or general public data stored on its servers or transmitted through its networks, any of which could
involve many people and have an impact on the Group's reputation, or lead to legal claims and liabilities
that are difficult to measure in advance.

In addition, the Telefonica Group's Internet access and hosting servers could lead to claims for illegal or
unlawful use of the Internet. Telefénica, like other telecommunications providers, may be held liable for
any loss, transfer or inappropriate modification of the customer data stored on its servers or carried by its
networks.

In most countries in which the Telefonica Group operates, the provision of its Internet access and hosting
services (including the operation of websites with shelf-generated content) are regulated under a limited
liability regime applicable to the content that it makes available to the public as a technical service
provider, particularly content protected by copyright or similar laws. However, regulatory changes have
been introduced imposing additional obligations on access providers (such as blocking access to a
website) as part of the struggle against some illegal or illicit uses of the Internet, notably in Europe.

Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on the business, financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Group.

Telefénica and Telefonica Group companies are party to lawsuits, tax claims and other legal
proceedings.

Telefonica and Telefonica Group companies are party to lawsuits, tax claims and other legal proceedings
in the ordinary course of their businesses, the financial outcome of which is unpredictable. An adverse
outcome or settlement in these or other proceedings could result in significant costs and may have a
material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and
cash flows. In particular, the Telefénica Group is party to certain judicial tax proceedings in Peru
concerning the clearance of certain previous years’ income tax, in respect of which a contentious-
administrative appeal is currently pending and to certain tax proceedings in Brazil, primarily relating to
the CIMS (a Brazilian tax on telecommunication services). Further details on these matters are provided in
Notes 17 and 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Trend evolution

Telefonica is one of the world's leading mobile and fixed communications services providers, with a
strategy focused on becoming a leader in digital communications to support future growth.

In 2015, Telefonica made progress towards long-term profitable and sustainable growth, improving its
competitive position in key markets, increasing efficiencies and capturing synergies from the integrated
approach of its business, processes and technologies. During recent years, the Company has taken
several steps designed to transform its business, which have affected 2015 results:

First, Telefonica has developed new business models based on mobile data centric proposals,
bundled services, including converged fixed and mobile services, and digital capacities as part of a
group-wide digital transformation drive to address changing consumption habits. A key
component of this effort has been the increased investments in fiber and Long Term Evolution
technology, which Telefonica believes will allow it to further monetize data and digital services. In
this regard, Telefonica has significantly increased its number of data-driven accesses, including
78.0 million new smartphone accesses, 4.9 million new Pay TV accesses and 5.7 million new fiber
accesses during the 2013-2015 period, to more than offset declining revenues and thereby
increased average revenue per access year-on-year by 1.9% over the period.

Second, changing consumption habits have resulted in reduced demand for fixed voice and
mobile voice services and increased demand for mobile data services, such as watching videos
and internet browsing on a smartphone, which finally in 2015 has been at a sufficient pace to
offset in most of our markets the decline in fixed and mobile voice revenues (excluding declines
due to changes in regulation) and start to show a positive trend.

Third, Telefonica has strengthened its competitive position through a strategy of active portfolio
management and in-market consolidation in key markets like Germany (with the acquisition of
the E-Plus Group), Brazil (with the acquisition of GVT) and Spain (with the acquisition of DTS).
hese strategic acquisitions in core markets, coupled with recent divestments in non-core
markets, have already allowed Telefonica to capture significant synergies.

4

Finally, Telefonica has launched a simplification program designed to enable growth and
transformation across its businesses; capture Group-wide synergies; simplify its commercial
offerings (as it has done with the launch of “Movistar Fusion" bundle packages in Spain);
modernize its information technology (“IT”) network and global processes (through increased IT
investment and commercial and customer care cost-reduction efforts); and improve its channels
by increasing back-office efficiency. As part of this program, Telefonica has also sought to boost
fficiency by increasing its outsourcing of support functions.

o

Telefonica has taken these steps against a backdrop of several broad trends and developments affecting
Telefonica in recent years which have contributed to a downward trend in certain key performance
indicators during the 2013-2015 period.

First, changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly during 2014 and 2015 with the depreciation
of the Brazilian real against the euro and the effects of the depreciation of the Venezuelan
bolivar, have affected Telefénica’s revenue growth.

Second, inflation rates have increased Telefénica's expenses in many of our markets and we
have not been able to increase our revenues at the same pace.

Third, after a period of significant expansion, Telefonica has generally reduced the scope of its
activities and exited certain countries in recent years to reduce its level of indebtedness and
strengthen Telefonica's capacity for future growth.

e Fourth, Telefénica's business is highly regulated, which affects its revenues and imposes costs
on its operations. For example, regulation sets the fixed rates that Telefonica charges for calls
received from other companies’ networks, and regulators have progressively lowered these rates
in recent years.

e In addition, weak economic conditions in Europe generally, and in Spain in particular, have been a
key driver of revenue trends in recent years, leading to a reduced demand for many of
Telefonica's products and services, and the same trend is beginning to emerge in Latin America.

These trends and developments have contributed to a general downward trend in certain of Telefénica’s
key performance indicators during the 2013-2015 period, with revenues decreasing by 6.6% to 47,219
million euros for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 50,547 million euros for the year ended
December 31, 2013 and operating income, profit for the year and net cash from operating activities
decreasing during this period by 67.6%, 40.2% and 5.1%, respectively.

Nevertheless, we believe that Telefonica is positioned to benefit from the return to GDP growth in
Europe, which began in 2014, as well as the potential implementation of the European Commission's
recently announced Digital Single Market package of legislative measures, as we believe Telefonica is
prepared to thrive in a policy environment that supports innovation and investment for the benefits of
end users.

Other information

Group companies with non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests in the Telefonica Group companies can be divided into two groups. Firstly,
subsidiaries listed in a regulated market: Telefénica Brasil and Telefonica Deutschland,
where minority shareholdings are widely dispersed and in respect of which Telefénica protects minority
interests by complying with the regulations of the related market. Secondly, subsidiaries with a main
minority shareholder, with whom agreements are entered into in order to guarantee the protection of
such shareholder's rights and, in certain cases (such as Colombia Telecomunicaciones) where there are
also specific commitments resulting from corporate transactions (see Note 21.b).

Average payment period of the Spanish companies

The Telefonica Group's Spanish companies have adapted their internal processes and payment schedules
to the provisions of Law 15/2010 (amended by Law 31/2014) and Royal Decree-Law 4/2013, amending
Law 3/2004, which establishes measures against late payment in commercial transactions. Engagement
conditions with commercial suppliers in 2015 included payment periods of up to 60 days, according to
the terms agreed between the parties.

For efficiency purposes, the Telefonica Group's companies in Spain have agreed payment schedules with
suppliers, whereby payments are made on set days of each month. Payments to Spanish suppliers in
2015 surpassing the established legal limit were the result of circumstances or incidents beyond the
payment policies, mainly the delay in issuing invoices (legal obligation of the supplier), the closing of
agreements with suppliers over the delivery of goods or the rendering of services, or occasional
processing issues. The average payment period to suppliers of the Telefonica Group's companies in Spain
in 2015, calculated In accordance with the only additional provision of the Resolution of the Instituto de
Contabilidad y Auditoria de Cuentas (Spanish Accounting and Audit Institute) dated January 29, 2016,
amounted to 49 days.

Governance system

The Company has a governance system, which applies to Telefénica's entire structure. Pursuant to the
Company's commitment to its shareholders, the Board of Directors, supported by its Committees,
manages the Company's business in accordance with the corporate governance rules laid down primarily
in the Corporate By-laws, in the Regulation of the General Shareholders’ Meeting, and in the Regulation of
the Board of Directors.

Telefénica's Board of Directors consists of 18 directors and is responsible for overseeing and controlling
the Company's activity. It has sole powers regarding general strategy and policies on corporate
governance, corporate social responsibility, remuneration of the Board and senior management,
shareholder remuneration, and strategic investments.

In order to strengthen the corporate governance of the Company, the Board of Directors of Telefénica,
S.A. has eight committees (including the Executive Commission) which are charged with examining and
overseeing areas of particular relevance. Pursuant to its regulation, the Board also confers responsibility
for day-to-day management of the businesses to Telefénica's executive bodies (primarily through the
Executive Committee) and management team.
