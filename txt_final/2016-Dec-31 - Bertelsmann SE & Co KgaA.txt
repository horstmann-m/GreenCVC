Report of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. This Combined
Management Report outlines the business performance,
including the business result and the position of the
Bertelsmann Group and Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. Infor-
mation about Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA in accordance
with the German Commercial Code (HGB) will be detailed in a
separate section. The Combined Management Report will be
published instead of the Group Management Report within
the Bertelsmann Annual Report.

Corporate Profile

Bertelsmann operates in the core business fields of media,
services and education in around 50 countries worldwide. The
geographic core markets are Western Europe — in particular,
Germany, France and the United Kingdom — and the
United States. In addition, Bertelsmann is strengthening its
involvement in growth markets such as China, India and
Brazil. The Bertelsmann divisions are RTL Group (television),
Penguin Random House (books), Gruner + Jahr (magazines),
BMG (music), Arvato (services), Bertelsmann Printing Group
(printing), Bertelsmann Education Group (education) and

Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is a capital-market-oriented but
unlisted partnership limited by shares. As a Group holding
company, it exercises central corporate functions such as the
specification and development of the Group’s strategy, capital
allocation, financing and management development. Internal
corporate management and reporting follow the Group's
organizational structure, which consists of the operating
divisions and Corporate.

RTL Group is, based on revenue, one of the leading televi-
sion groups in the broadcasting, content and digital business
with interests in 60 television channels, 31 radio stations and
content production throughout the world. The television port-
folio of RTL Group includes RTL Television in Germany, M6
in France and the RTL channels in the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Croatia and Hungary, as well as investments in
Atresmedia in Spain and RTL CBS Asia Entertainment Network
in Southeast Asia. Fremantle Media is one of the largest inter-
national creators, producers and distributors of a wide range
of formats outside the United States. Combining the catch-up

TV services of its broadcasters, the multichannel networks
BroadbandTV, StyleHaul and Divimove and Fremantle Media’s
260 YouTube channels, RTL Group has become the leading
European media company based on online video views.
Furthermore, RTL Group owns a majority stake in SpotX, a
programmatic video advertising platform. The publicly traded
RTL Group S.A. is listed on the German MDAX index.

Penguin Random House is, based on revenue, the world's larg-
est trade book publisher, with more than 250 imprints across
five continents. Its book brands include storied imprints such as
Doubleday, Viking and Alfred A. Knopf (United States), Ebury,
Hamish Hamilton and Jonathan Cape (United Kingdom), Plaza &
Janés and Alfaguara (Spain) and Sudamericana (Argentina), as
well as the international imprint Dorling Kindersley. Each year
Penguin Random House publishes over 15,000 new titles and
sells nearly 800 million print books, e-books and audio books.
Germany’s Verlagsgruppe Random House, which includes
illustrious publishing houses such as Goldmann and Heyne, is
not part of Penguin Random House from a legal point of view,
but is under the same corporate management and is part of the
Penguin Random House division.

Gruner + Jahr is represented in over 20 countries with more
than 500 magazines and digital businesses. G+J Germany
publishes well-known magazines such as “Stern,” “Brigitte”
and “Geo.” The digital business consists of publishing
offerings, communities, commerce transactions such as the
“Schoner Wohnen” shop and the Ligatus Ad-Tech business.
Gruner + Jahr owns 59.9 percent of Motor Presse Stuttgart.
In France, G+J operates Prisma Media, the country’s largest
print and digital magazine publisher in terms of overall reach.

BMG is an international group that manages music publishing
rights and recording rights. With 14 branches in 12 major
music markets, BMG now represents more than 2.5 million
songs and recordings, including those in the catalogs of
Chrysalis, Bug, Cherry Lane, Sanctuary, Primary Wave and
Alberts Music.

Arvato develops and implements innovative solutions for
customers in a wide range of sectors in over 40 countries for
all kinds of business processes. These comprise Customer
Relationship Management (CRM), Supply Chain Management
(SCM), Financial Solutions and IT Services.

The Bertelsmann Printing Group bundles all of Bertelsmann’s
offset and gravure printing activities. It comprises the German

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2016 5


--- Page 5 ---

offset printers Mohn Media, GGP Media and Vogel Druck;
the gravure activities of Prinovis in Germany and the United
Kingdom; and the offset and digital printers Berryville Graphics,
Coral Graphics and OPM in the United States. The group offers
a wide range of print and other services. The Bertelsmann
Printing Group also includes RTV Media Group, the creative
services provider MBS and the storage media producer Sonopress.

Bertelsmann Education Group comprises Bertelsmann’s edu-
cation activities. The digital education and service offerings are
primarily in the healthcare and technology sectors. The education
activities include the e-learning providers Relias Learning and
Udacity and the investments in the online education platform
HotChalk and in Alliant International University.

Bertelsmann Investments bundles Bertelsmann’s global start-up
investments. The activities are focused on the strategic growth
markets of Brazil, China and India and on the United States and
Europe. Investments are made through the funds Bertelsmann
Brazil Investments (BBI), Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI),
Bertelsmann India Investments (BII) and Bertelsmann Digital
Media Investments (BDMI).

Regulatory Environment

Bertelsmann has television and radio operations in several
European countries that are subject to regulation. In Germany,
for example, media are subject to oversight by the Commission
on Concentration in the Media. Bertelsmann Group companies
occupy leading market positions in many lines of business
and may therefore have limited potential for growth through
acquisition due to antitrust legislation. Moreover, some
education activities are subject to regulatory provisions of
government authorities and accreditation bodies.

Because its profit participation certificates and bonds are
publicly listed, Bertelsmann is required to comply in full
with capital market regulations applicable to publicly traded
companies.

Shareholder Structure

Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is an unlisted partnership limited
by shares. Three foundations (Bertelsmann Stiftung, Reinhard
Mohn Stiftung and BVG-Stiftung) indirectly hold 80.9 percent
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shares, with the remaining
19.1 percent held indirectly by the Mohn family. Bertelsmann
Verwaltungsgesellschaft (BVG) controls all voting rights at
the General Meeting of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and
Bertelsmann Management SE (general partner).

Strategy

Bertelsmann’s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability
with efficient capital investment at the same time (see the
“Value-Oriented Management System” section).

Bertelsmann aims to achieve a faster-growing, more digital,
more international and more diversified Group portfolio.
Businesses in which Bertelsmann invests should have long-
term stable growth, global reach, stable and protectable
business models, high market-entry barriers and scalability. The
education business is being gradually developed into the third
earnings pillar alongside the media and service businesses.
Group strategy comprises four strategic priorities — strengthen-
ing the core businesses, driving the digital transformation for-
ward, developing growth platforms and expanding into growth
regions. In the financial year 2016, Bertelsmann continued to
make significant progress in line with these strategic priorities.

As part of strengthening the core businesses, the Ad Alliance
was formed as a cooperation in advertising marketing
between Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland and Gruner + Jahr.
In 2016, RTL Group launched new TV channels. Gruner + Jahr
founded Deutsche Medien-Manufaktur in conjunction with
Landwirtschaftsverlag and also focused on the core markets
of Germany and France through the disposals of the publishing
group News in Austria and G+J Spain. A new management
structure was implemented at Bertelsmann Printing Group.
Bertelsmann continued to roll out the Group-wide earnings
improvement program.

The Group also pushed forward with the digital transformation at
RTL Group, through the takeover of the online video marketer
Smartclip among other things. Gruner + Jahr expanded its
digital businesses primarily through the acquisition of the
French digital video provider Groupe Cerise, the takeover of
the demand-side platform provider LiquidM and the increase
in its stake in (and thus complete takeover of) the market-
ing services provider trnd. Arvato generated growth through
services for companies in the |T/high-tech sector and with
e-commerce services.

The growth platforms were strengthened through the acquisi-
tion of a majority share in the ARC Music publishing catalog
and signing contracts with many new artists at BMG — includ-
ing Pink Floyd founding member and songwriter Roger
Waters. BMG also entered the Australian market and
took over the Australian music publisher Alberts. Arvato
created the conditions for the further expansion of its SCM


--- Page 6 ---

services by developing a new logistics center in the Eastern
Ruhr region and also commissioning a distribution center in
Gennep, Netherlands. In addition, Arvato posted further sales
successes in the Financial Solutions division. The education
business was further reinforced by, among other things, the
continued organic and acquisitive expansion of the activities of
Relias Learning. For example, Relias Learning expanded inter-
nationally and took over the US companies CMT, AHC Media
and Swank Healthcare, among others. The e-learning provider
Udacity also continued to expand its business internationally
and is now also operating in Brazil, China, India and Germany
with its Nanodegree offerings.

As part of expanding its presence in growth regions, the BAI
fund made further new and follow-up investments in China
and made a positive contribution to Group profit through
gains from disposals of investments. In India, Bertelsmann
strengthened its activities in strategically relevant business
areas by acquiring stakes in the e-commerce services
provider KartRocket, the social fashion network Roposo, the
budget hotel marketplace Treebo and the Fintech company
Lendingkart. BBI in cooperation with its strategic partner
Bozano Investimentos took stakes in the university education
provider Medcel and the NRE Education Group.

Bertelsmann will push ahead with its transformation into a
faster-growing, more digital, more international and more
diversified Group in 2017 in line with the four strategic priori-
ties. Compliance with and achievement of the strategic devel-
opment priorities are continuously examined by the Executive
Board at the divisional level through regular meetings of the
Strategy and Business Committee and as part of the annual
Strategic Planning Dialogue between the Executive Board and
the Supervisory Board. In addition, relevant markets and the
competitive environment are analyzed on an ongoing basis in
order to draw conclusions concerning the further development
of the Group's strategy. The Executive Board is also supported
by the Group Management Committee (GMC) on issues of
corporate strategy and development. This Committee is com-
posed of executives representing key businesses, countries,
regions and select Group-wide functions.

The Group's content-based and entrepreneurial creativity will
remain very important for the implementation of its strategy.
Bertelsmann will therefore continue to invest significantly in
the creative core of its businesses. In addition, Bertelsmann
needs to have qualified employees at all levels of the Group
to ensure its strategic and financial success. Innovation com-
petence is also very important for Bertelsmann and is a key
strategic component (see the “Innovations” section).

Value-Oriented Management System

Bertelsmann’s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability.
In order to manage the Group, Bertelsmann has been using
a value-oriented management system for many years, which
focuses on revenues, operating earnings and optimum capital
investment. For formal reasons, Bertelsmann makes a distinc-
tion between strictly defined and broadly defined operational
performance indicators.

Strictly defined operational performance indicators, including
revenues, operating EBITDA and Bertelsmann Value Added
(BVA), are used to directly assess current business perfor-
mance and are correspondingly used in the outlook. These are
distinguished from performance indicators used in the broader
sense, which are partially derived from the above-mentioned
indicators or are strongly influenced by these. These include
the EBITDA margin and the cash conversion rate. The financial
management system, with defined internal financing targets,
is also part of the broadly defined value-oriented management
system. Details of the expected development of performance
indicators used in the broader sense are provided as additional
information and are not included in the outlook.

In order to explain the business performance and to control
and manage the Group, Bertelsmann also uses alternative
performance measures that are not defined in accordance with
IFRS (more details are given in the “Alternative Performance
Measures” section).

Strictly Defined Operational Performance Indicators

In order to control and manage the Group, Bertelsmann uses
revenues, operating EBITDA and BVA as performance indica-
tors. Revenue is used as a growth indicator of businesses.
In the financial year 2016, organic growth was 0.9 percent.
Group revenues of €17.0 billion were 1.1 percent below the
previous year's figure (previous year: €17.1 billion) due to
exchange rate and portfolio effects.

A key performance indicator for measuring the profitability
of the Bertelsmann Group and the divisions is the operating
EBITDA. Operating EBITDA increased to €2,568 million
(previous year: €2,485 million) in the reporting period.

Bertelsmann uses BVA for assessing the profitability of opera-
tions and return on invested capital. BVA measures the profit
realized above and beyond the appropriate return on invested
capital. BVA in the financial year 2016 was €147 million compared

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2016 7


--- Page 7 ---

to the previous year's figure of €155 million. The impact of the
increase in average invested capital could only partially be offset
by the improved year-on-year operating earnings.

Broadly Defined Performance Indicators

In order to assess business development, other performance
indicators are used that are partially derived from revenues and
operating EBITDA or are strongly influenced by these figures.

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash generated
from business activities, which should be between 90 and
100 percent as a long-term average. The cash conversion rate
in the financial year 2016 increased to 93 percent (previous
year: 83 percent) as a result of an improved cash generation
from operations and an associated increase in cash flow from
operating activities.

The EBITDA margin is used as an additional criterion for
assessing business performance. The EBITDA margin in the
financial year 2016 improved to 15.1 percent compared to
14.5 percent in the previous year.

Bertelsmann’s financial management and controlling system
is defined by the internal financial targets outlined in the
“Net Assets and Financial Position” section. These financing
principles are pursued in the management of the Group and
are included in the broadly defined value-oriented manage-
ment system.

The non-financial performance indicators (employees, corporate
responsibility and innovations) are not included in the broadly
defined value-oriented management system. As they can only
be measured to a limited extent, it is not possible to make any
clear quantifiable statements concerning interrelated effects and
value increases. For this reason, the non-financial performance
indicators are not used for the management of the Group.

Non-Financial Performance Indicators
Employees

At the end of the financial year 2016, the Group had
116,434 employees worldwide. In 2016, there were 1,225 people
serving in trainee positions in Bertelsmann companies in
Germany.

The purpose of the human resources (HR) strategy is to
support the implementation of the Group's strategy. In
2016, the main focus was again on the further development
and training of employees. This included a comprehensive

8 Financial Information Combined Management Report

adaptation of the central talent management processes and
tools and the establishment of further talent pools.

Continuous employee training is the basis of a company’s
future economic success. In view of this, the training courses
offered by Bertelsmann University have been further digi-
tized and expanded. Furthermore, at the end of 2016, some
80,000 employees in 31 countries were able to access training
courses on the Group-wide “peoplenet” HR IT platform.

At Bertelsmann, partnership primarily involves working with
employees to shape the company. For this reason, the
employee survey has been an important tool for many years at
Bertelsmann. In 2016, 89 percent of employees took part in the
worldwide survey. Supporting dialogue between the employee
representatives and dialogue with Bertelsmann management
is also very important for a cooperative corporate culture. As
a result of this, a number of conferences were held in 2016
that, in particular, looked at how changes could be addressed.
At the Diversity Conference in February 2016, business cases
on the topic of diversity within the Group were presented and
new concepts developed.

One priority of the HR strategy is the Bertelsmann Sense of
Purpose. The Sense of Purpose “To Empower. To Create. To
Inspire.” was formulated and communicated in an interna-
tional dialogue with various stakeholders.

Bertelsmann has been one of the pioneers in profit sharing since
1970. Thus, a total of €95 million (previous year: €85 million)
was distributed to employees worldwide in 2016, thanks to
the positive operating results for the previous year.

Corporate Responsibility

The aim of corporate responsibility (CR) at Bertelsmann is to
bring the economic interests in line with the Group's social
and ecological concerns as part of a dialogue with all relevant
stakeholders.

In view of this, the Bertelsmann Corporate Responsibility
Council continued its cross-divisional dialogue and the strategic
further development of significant Group-wide CR topics in
2016. The focus here was on employee concerns such as
training, fair working conditions, health and diversity, societal
and environmental concerns such as freedom of the press,
media user/customer protection and eco-efficiency.

In 2016, Bertelsmann reported on its activities in these
areas in the magazine “24/7 Responsibility.” The Group also
published an online index on its website in accordance with
the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4)


--- Page 8 ---

and Bertelsmann’s fifth annual carbon footprint report with
extensive details regarding greenhouse gas emissions and
further environmental data.

Also in 2016, Bertelsmann made donations and was involved
in a wide range of funding initiatives in the areas of education,
culture, science and creativity.

Innovations

Businesses invest in the research and development of new
products in order to ensure their long-term competitiveness.
The media sector has a similar imperative to create innovative
media content and media-related products and services
in a rapidly changing environment. This means that rather
than conventional research and development activities, the
company’s own innovative power and business development
are particularly important to Bertelsmann. The long-term
success of the Group depends heavily on product innovations,
investing in growth markets and integrating new technolo-
gies. Furthermore, innovative expertise is very important for
strategy implementation and, in the future, will be anchored
even more strongly within the Bertelsmann Group in organi-
zational terms.

Bertelsmann relies on innovation and growth in core
operations and new business fields. The key success factors
of Bertelsmann’s innovation management include continuously
following cross-industry trends and observing new markets.
At the Group level, Bertelsmann works with the divisions to
continuously identify and implement innovative business
strategies. Alongside market-oriented activities, support is
given to Group-wide initiatives that actively promote knowledge
transfer and collaboration. At regular innovation forums,
executives meet with internal and external experts to examine
success factors for innovation and creativity.

The innovations at RTL Group are focused on three core
topics — developing and acquiring new, high-quality TV content
and formats, using all digital means of distribution, and
expanding diverse forms of advertising sales and monetization.
The new innovative TV formats include “The Young Pope,”
a production by the Italian Fremantle Media subsidiary
Wildside, and the adaptation of the novel “American Gods” by
Fremantle Media North America that is currently in production.
RTL Group also expanded its position in the marketing of
online videos. In particular, the takeover of Smartclip by
Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland reinforced the technological
competence of RTL Group and offers global innovation
opportunities in cooperation with SpotX. Synergy Committees
are used for exchanging information and knowledge within
RTL Group. As a result of the growing significance of big data

and the provision and use of data, the position of Head of
Smart Data was created at Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland
in 2016.

The innovations at Penguin Random House incorporate a
number of key areas, including innovative approaches toward
content, distribution and interaction with consumers. In the
digital sector the company is exploring new technologies in
conjunction with well-known industry players. One example
of this from the United States is the recording of children’s
book titles on the voice-activated platform Google Home.
Penguin Random House also continues to identify new ways in
which readers can discover authors and their works in order to
reach the widest possible audience. Examples of this include
“Subway Reads,” an eight-week advertising campaign in the
United States, where train commuters were offered e-books
by Penguin Random House, and “Puffin World of Stories,”
a partnership with OnBlackheath for a family festival in the
United Kingdom.

As well as the digital transformation, the innovations at
Gruner + Jahr in various market segments were also a key
focus in 2016. The digital business also grew strongly as a
result of significantly increased advertising revenues from
the brand websites and at the performance marketer Ligatus
through innovative developments such as the marketing plat-
forms InCircles and AppLike or the multichannel food network
“Club of Cooks.” G+J expanded its e-commerce activities
with the “Schoéner Wohnen” shop. The publishing house
Deutsche Medien-Manufaktur founded by Gruner + Jahr and
Landwirtschaftsverlag successfully launched innovative mag-
azines such as “Wolf” and “Essen & Trinken mit Thermomix.”
G+J also formed Germany's largest provider of content com-
munication services, Territory.

The innovations at BMG concern market access and product
innovations in particular. In 2016 these included the global
bundling of distribution in the label business into one distri-
bution partner (Warner/ADA) and the creation of the song-
writer workshop model SoundLab. In China, BMG expanded
its cooperation with Alibaba Music, the music division of the
e-commerce company Alibaba, with the aim of developing
new music offerings for the Chinese market and to make it
easier for international artists to access digital music platforms
in China. In the digital sector, BMG extended the manage-
ment of audiovisual content to live streaming and was able to
stream excerpts from concerts by the artists Albert Hammond,
Katie Melua and LP live on the Internet as part of its television
program “Berlin Live” in cooperation with Arte.

The innovations at Arvato were driven forward in a number of
different areas. These include promoting internal dialogue on

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2016 9


--- Page 9 ---

innovation topics, analyzing the use of innovative technologies,
investing in innovative projects in the area of cloud infrastruc-
ture, creating innovation partnerships with companies such as
IBM Watson, developing new products and solutions in the area
of fraud prevention, and investing in innovative companies.

The innovations of the Bertelsmann Printing Group are mainly
in optimizing technology and processes and in developing
new products and services. One innovative approach is the
development and launch of the optical data carrier Ultra HD
Blu-ray 100 by Sonopress. In summer 2016, the storage
media producer Sonopress obtained the certification for the
innovative optical data carrier, commenced fully automated
production of the innovative data carrier and thus successfully
positioned itself in a new market segment.

The innovations at Bertelsmann Education Group refer to the
further development of digital education offerings. For example,
Relias Learning developed over 400 new online courses for
employees in the healthcare sector and started local courses
in the United Kingdom, Germany and China. The group was
also able to expand its capabilities in the area of analytics with
the aim of creating personalized training courses and improving
performance within companies. At Udacity, further training
programs were developed, such as, among other things,
“Self-Driving Car Engineer” and “Artificial Intelligence,” which
give students the qualifications for future jobs in technology.

Report on Economic Position

Corporate Environment
Overall Economic Developments

In 2016 global economic expansion was moderate but accel-
erated slightly toward the end of the year. Real GDP once
again increased by 3.1 percent compared to 3.1 percent in
2015. The global economy in 2016 was characterized by
stable growth in the developed economies and a slight upturn
in the emerging countries.

The economic recovery in the eurozone continued. Real GDP
grew by 1.7 percent in 2016 compared to 1.5 percent in
the previous year. More favorable financing conditions and
sustained employment growth were the key drivers of this
positive development.

The German economy proved to be robust, particularly
as a result of strong domestic demand. Real GDP grew by

10 Financial Information Combined Management Report

1.9 percent compared to 1.7 percent in the previous year.
In France, too, the economic growth continued. Real GDP
growth was 1.1 percent in 2016 compared to 1.2 percent in
2015. In the United Kingdom, economic activity slowed, with
an increase in real GDP of 2.0 percent compared to a rise of
2.4 percent in the previous year.

In the United States, after a weak first six months, real GDP
increased by 1.9 percent in 2016 compared to a rise of
2.4 percent in 2015.

Developments in Relevant Markets

The following analysis focuses on markets and regions that
are of a sufficient size and that are strategically important from
a Group perspective.

The majority of the European TV advertising markets developed
favorably in 2016. The TV advertising markets in Germany,
France, Belgium and Croatia showed slight to moderate
growth, while the TV advertising market in Spain once again
reported significant growth. By contrast, the development of
the TV markets in the Netherlands and Hungary showed a
slight to moderate decline.

Sales of printed books in the United States and the United
Kingdom saw moderate growth, while publishing sales of
e-books fell as a result of changes to sales conditions. The
German- and Spanish-language book markets showed largely
stable development.

The magazine markets in Germany and France in 2016 were
characterized by strongly declining print advertising business
and moderately declining circulation business, while the
digital business posted strong growth.

The global music markets in 2016 reported moderate growth
in the publishing and recording rights segments.

The key service markets for Arvato, namely CRM, SCM,
Financial Solutions and IT, saw moderate to significant growth.

Overall, the relevant European print markets declined in 2016,
while the offset market showed far more stable development
than the gravure printing market. The North American book
printing market saw a moderate decline over the same period.

The education markets in the United States grew strongly
overall in 2016 in the market segments where Bertelsmann is
involved — namely, healthcare and technology, online services
and university education.

Significant Events in the Financial Year

At its meeting on January 26, 2016, the Supervisory Board
appointed Bernd Hirsch as the new Bertelsmann Chief Financial
Officer. As of April 1, 2016, he took over the department from
Executive Board Chairman Thomas Rabe who had performed
this function in addition to his other responsibilities on a
transitional basis.

With the acquisition of Smartclip in March 2016, Medien-
gruppe RTL Deutschland has significantly extended its options
in the area of digital advertising marketing and has therefore
enhanced its growth strategy. The acquisition simultaneously
strengthens RTL Group's technological competence and, in
cooperation with SpotX, opens up global innovation options.

At the end of May 2016, the French G+J subsidiary Prisma
Media took over Groupe Cerise, a digital media company
operating in the video sector in France. Cerise develops its
own technologies in order to produce and distribute content,
thus ensuring that its brands reach a wide audience.

In December 2016, Bertelsmann Education Group took over
Advanced Practice Strategies (APS), a provider of e-learning
products for clinical assessments and performance improvement
for US hospitals. With this takeover, Bertelsmann Education
Group is expanding its range of acute healthcare services and
strengthening its service offerings in terms of the targeted
provision of online training courses and employee assessments.

Results of Operations

The following analysis of earnings performance relates to
continuing operations as of December 31, 2016. Please refer

Revenues by Division

to the “Performance of the Group Divisions” section for a
more detailed picture of the results of operations.

Revenue Development

In the financial year 2016, Group revenues of €17.0 billion were
1.1 percent below the previous year’s figure (previous year:
€17.1 billion). The revenue decline is primarily attributable to
negative exchange rate effects, portfolio effects of disposals
and declining organic revenues at Penguin Random House and
Bertelsmann Printing Group. This was contrasted by organic
revenue growth at RTL Group in particular and at BMG, Arvato
and Bertelsmann Education Group. The Group achieved
organic growth of 0.9 percent, adjusted for exchange rate and
portfolio effects. The exchange rate effects were -1.3 percent
and the portfolio effects were -0.7 percent.

Revenues at RTL Group rose 3.5 percent to €6,237 million (previous
year: €6,029 million). The organic growth was 3.2 percent. This
was mainly attributable to the fast-growing digital activities and
positive developments in the French and German television
businesses. Revenues at Penguin Random House declined by
9.6 percent to €3,361 million (previous year: €3,717 million). The
organic growth was -3.9 percent. The revenue decline resulted
primarily from portfolio and exchange rate effects. A decline in
e-book revenues that was partly due to new sales conditions
in the retail market had an adverse effect on organic growth. At
€1,580 million, Gruner + Jahr’s revenues were down 1.9 percent
year on year (previous year: €1,611 million). The organic growth
was -1.3 percent. The revenue decline stems largely from the
portfolio effects of disposals and declining print advertising
and circulation revenues. This was offset by revenue growth
of new and digital businesses. Revenues at BMG increased by
12.2 percent to €416 million (previous year: €371 million) as a
result of further organic and acquisitive business expansion.
The organic growth was 12.8 percent. Revenues at Arvato rose

1.4 percent to €3,838 million (previous year: €3,783 million).
The organic growth was 3.9 percent. The increase stemmed
in particular from positive business development in the CRM
and Financial Solutions divisions. Revenues at Bertelsmann
Printing Group fell 6.9 percent to €1,624 million (previous year:
€1,744 million). The organic growth was -4.0 percent. The
revenue decline was primarily attributable to the closure of
Sonopress USA in the reporting period and the disposal of the
Spanish print companies in 2015. Bertelsmann Education Group
increased its revenues by 28.9 percent to €142 million (previous
year: €110 million). The organic growth was 15.9 percent.
The rise was primarily the result of the organic and acquisitive
expansion of Relias Learning. None of the held investments in
the fund activities grouped under Bertelsmann Investments are
fully consolidated.

There were changes in the geographical breakdown of revenues
compared to the previous year. The share of revenues generated
in Germany was 34.6 percent compared to 33.9 percent in
the previous year. The revenue share generated by France
amounted to 13.2 percent (previous year: 13.2 percent). In the
United Kingdom, the revenue share was 6.4 percent (previous
year: 6.7 percent). The share of total revenues generated by the
other European countries amounted to 18.3 percent compared
to 17.7 percent in the previous year. The revenue share
generated by the United States was 20.8 percent (previous
year: 21.6 percent), and the other countries achieved a revenue
share of 6.7 percent (previous year: 6.9 percent). This means
that the share of total revenues generated by foreign business
was 65.4 percent (previous year: 66.1 percent). Year on year,
there was a slight change in the ratio of the four revenue
sources (own products and merchandise, advertising, services,
rights and licenses) to overall revenue.

The revenue share generated by the growth businesses
increased to 30 percent overall (previous year: 28 percent),
thanks to organic growth and acquisitions, while the revenue
share of structurally declining businesses fell to 4 percent
overall (previous year: 5 percent) as a result of disposals and
scaling back. The growth businesses comprise those activities
that post continuous revenue increases due to sustained posi-
tive market factors and that have been identified as growth
priorities as part of Group strategy. These include the digital
businesses of RTL Group and Gruner + Jahr; the TV produc-
tion, music business and the service businesses in the Arvato
divisions of SCM Solutions, Financial Solutions and Systems;
the education business and the fund activities. The structurally
declining businesses comprise those activities that post sus-
tained revenue losses due to market factors. These include in
particular the gravure printing activities and the storage media
replication business.

Operating EBITDA

Bertelsmann achieved a 3.3 percent increase in operating
EBITDA to €2,568 million in the financial year 2016 (previous
year: €2,485 million), despite start-up losses for digital and
new businesses. The increase in operating earnings was
essentially generated by RTL Group, BMG and Arvato. The
EBITDA margin of 15.1 percent was above the high level of
14.5 percent in the previous year.

Operating EBITDA at RTL Group rose 3.7 percent to
€1,405 million (previous year: €1,355 million). The increase
was primarily attributable to higher earnings contributions
from the French and German television businesses. The French
television businesses profited above all from a positive effect
in connection with the gradual phase-out of the M6 Mobile
contract. Penguin Random House posted lower earnings
due to lower revenues. The operating EBITDA declined by
3.6 percent to €537 million (previous year: €557 million).
Gruner + Jahr’s operating EBITDA increased by 4.6 percent to

€137 million (previous year: €131 million), in particular thanks
to a higher contribution to earnings by G+J Germany. BMG's
operating EBITDA rose by 13.1 percent to €95 million (previous
year: €84 million), thanks to the continued development of the
business. At Arvato, operating EBITDA grew by 14.7 percent
to €359 million (previous year: €313 million). All Solution
Groups posted improved earnings, particularly the service
businesses for IT and SCM. Operating EBITDA at Bertelsmann
Printing Group declined by 4.8 percent to €118 million
(previous year: €124 million) due to the persistently declining
print market and as a result of divestments. Operating EBITDA
at Bertelsmann Education Group amounted to €-17 million
(previous year: €-5 million). This was mainly due to planned
start-up losses for further business expansion of the invest-
ments in the online education platform HotChalk and the
online learning provider Udacity, both of which were acquired
in the previous year. None of the investments in the fund
activities grouped under Bertelsmann Investments are fully
consolidated, therefore in most cases no operating results are
disclosed for this segment.

Special Items

Special items in the financial year 2016 totaled €-139 million
compared to €-191 million in the previous year. They con-
sisted of impairment losses and reversals on impairments on
investments accounted for using the equity method totaling
€4 million (previous year: €-23 million), impairments on other
financial assets of €-22 million (previous year: €-17 million),
adjustments of carrying amounts of assets held for sale of
€-14 million (previous year: —), fair value remeasurement of
investments of €12 million (previous year: €82 million), results
from disposals of investments totaling €41 million (previous
year: €24 million), restructuring expenses and other adjustments
totaling €-152 million (previous year: €-257 million) (see also
the reconciliation of EBIT to operating EBITDA in the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, segment information).
Results from disposals of investments were particularly charac-
terized by gains on disposals at Bertelsmann Investments.

EBIT

EBIT amounted to €1,799 million in the financial year 2016
(previous year: €1,681 million) after adjusting operating
EBITDA for special items totaling €-139 million (previous year:
€-191 million) and the amortization, depreciation, impair-
ments and reversals of impairments on intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment totaling €-630 million (previous
year: €-613 million), which were not included in adjustments.

Group Profit or Loss

The financial result was €-244 million compared to €-230 million
in the previous year. The year-on-year deviation was attribut-
able to a lower interest result and a lower other financial result.
The income tax expenses came to €-419 million compared
to €-346 million in the previous year, in particular due to the
improved earnings before taxes from continuing operations. In
addition, the positive special effects included in tax expenses
decreased compared to the same period in the previous year.
This produced after-tax earnings from continuing operations
of €1,136 million (previous year: €1,105 million). Taking into
account the after-tax earnings from discontinued operations of
€1 million (previous year: €3 million), this resulted in a Group
profit of €1,137 million (previous year: €1,108 million). The
share of Group profit held by non-controlling interests came to
€451 million (previous year: €431 million). The share of Group
profit held by Bertelsmann shareholders was €686 million
(previous year: €677 million). At the Annual General Meeting of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, an unchanged year-on-year divi-
dend payout of €180 million will be proposed for the financial
year 2016 (previous year: €180 million).

Net Assets and Financial Position
Financing Guidelines

The primary objective of Bertelsmann’s financial policy is
to achieve a balance between financial security, return on
equity and growth. For this, Bertelsmann bases its financing
policy on the requirements of a “Baa1/BBB+” credit rating
and the associated qualitative and quantitative criteria.
Credit ratings and capital market transparency make a
considerable contribution to the company’s financial security
and independence.

In accordance with the Group structure, the capital
allocation is made centrally by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA,
which provides the Group companies with liquidity and
manages the issuance of guarantees and letters of comfort
for them. The Group consists largely of a single financial
unit, thereby optimizing capital procurement and invest-
ment opportunities.

Bertelsmann utilizes a financial control system employ-
ing quantitative financial targets concerning the Group's
economic debt and, to a lesser extent, its capital structure.
One of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor
limited to the defined maximum of 2.5. As of December 31,
2016, the leverage factor of Bertelsmann was 2.5, slightly
above the previous year’s value (December 31, 2015:
2.4) but not over its self-imposed maximum value of 2.5
(see further explanation in the “Alternative Performance
Measures” section).

As of December 31, 2016, economic debt increased to
€5,913 million from €5,609 million in the previous year,
despite a reduction in net financial debt. In particular, pen-
sion provisions increased due to a lower discount interest
rate, while the net present value of the operating leases
increased due to a consolidation of locations at Penguin
Random House in the United States. The pension provisions
and similar obligations amounted to €1,999 million as of
December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015: €1,709 million).
The net financial debt fell to €2,625 million (previous year:
€2,765 million).

Another financial target is the coverage ratio. This is calcu-
lated as the ratio of operating EBITDA (after modifications)
to financial result, which is used to determine the leverage
factor and is supposed to be above 4. In the reporting
period, the coverage ratio was 9.7 (previous year: 10.1). The
Group's equity ratio was 41.6 percent (December 31, 2015:
41.2 percent), which remains significantly above the self-
imposed minimum of 25 percent.

Financing Activities

In April 2016, Bertelsmann placed a bond with a 10-year term
and an issue volume of €500 million. The bond, which is listed
in Luxembourg, has a fixed 1.125 percent coupon. In addi-
tion, Bertelsmann issued a promissory note in the amount of
€200 million with a term of two years in a private placement
in June 2016. The proceeds from the placements were used
to repay the bond, which became due in September 2016. As
of December 31, 2016, the carrying amounts of bonds and
promissory notes totaled €3.7 billion compared to €3.8 billion
as of December 31, 2015 (see also note 22 “Financial debt,
bonds and promissory notes”).

Rating

Bertelsmann has been rated by the rating agencies Moody’s
and Standard & Poor's (S&P) since 2002. The agency ratings

facilitate access to the international capital markets and are
therefore a key element of Bertelsmann’s financial security.
Bertelsmann is rated by Moody's as “Baal” (outlook: stable)
and by S&P as “BBB+” (outlook: stable). Both credit ratings
are in the investment-grade category and meet Bertelsmann’s
target rating. Bertelsmann’s short-term credit quality rating is
“P-2" from Moody's and “A-2” from S&P.

Credit Facilities

As well as its existing liquidity, the Bertelsmann Group has
access to liquidity via a syndicated loan with a term that in
2016 was extended by one year until 2021. This forms the
backbone of the strategic credit reserve; Bertelsmann can
utilize this to draw up to €1.2 billion of revolving funds in
euros, US dollars and pounds sterling.

Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities

The off-balance-sheet liabilities include contingent liabilities and
other financial commitments, almost all of which result from
operating activities conducted by the divisions. Off-balance-
sheet liabilities increased year on year. The off-balance-sheet
liabilities in place as of December 31, 2016, had no significant
negative effects on the Group's net assets, financial position
and results of operation for the past or the future financial year.

Investments

Total investments including financial debt acquired of €6 million
(previous year: €41 million) amounted to €1,244 million in the
financial year 2016 (previous year: €1,281 million). Invest-
ments according to the cash flow statement amounted to
€1,240 million (previous year: €1,259 million). As in previous
years, the majority of the €326 million investment in property,
plant and equipment (previous year: €297 million) stemmed
from Arvato. Investments in intangible assets came to
€388 million (previous year: €349 million) and were primarily
attributable to BMG for the acquisition of music catalogs
and to RTL Group for investments in film rights. The sum of
€248 million was invested in financial assets (previous year:
€447 million). These include, in particular, the investments of
Bertelsmann Investments. Purchase price payments for con-
solidated investments (less acquired cash and cash equiva-
lents) totaled €278 million in the reporting period (previous
year: €166 million). These include, in particular, the acquisition
of shares in Smartclip, APS and Groupe Cerise.

Balance Sheet

Total assets amounted to €23.8 billion as of December 31, 2016
(previous year: €22.9 billion). Cash and cash equivalents increased
to €1.4 billion (previous year: €1.3 billion). Equity increased to
€9.9 billion (previous year: €9.4 billion). This resulted in an
equity ratio of 41.6 percent (previous year: 41.2 percent). Equity
attributable to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shareholders was
€7.9 billion (previous year: €7.5 billion). Provisions for pensions
and similar obligations increased to €1,999 million (previous
year: €1,709 million) due to a reduction in the interest rate. Gross
financial debt only changed slightly to €3,998 million compared
to €4,075 million as of December 31, 2015, due to the taking up
and repayment of long-term debt of a comparable amount as
reported in the “Financing Activities” section. Apart from that,
the balance sheet structure remained largely unchanged from
the previous year.

Profit Participation Capital

Profit participation capital had a par value of €301 million as
of December 31, 2016, which is unchanged from the previous
year. If the effective interest method is applied, the carrying
amount of profit participation capital was €413 million as of
December 31, 2016 (previous year: €413 million). The 2001
profit participation certificates (ISIN DE0005229942) account
for 94 percent of par value of profit participation capital, while
the 1992 profit participation certificates (ISIN DE0005229900)
account for the remaining 6 percent.

The 2001 profit participation certificates are officially listed
for trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock

Exchange. Their price is listed as a percentage of par value. The
lowest closing rate of the 2001 profit participation certificates
in the financial year 2016 was 310.00 percent in January; their
highest was 335.02 percent in April.

Under the terms and conditions of the 2001 profit partici-
pation certificates, the payout for each full financial year is
15 percent of par value, subject to the availability of sufficient
Group profit and net income at the level of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA. These conditions were met in the past financial
year. Accordingly, a payout of 15 percent of the notional value
of the 2001 profit participation certificates will be made for the
financial year 2016.

The 1992 profit participation certificates, approved for trad-
ing on the Regulated Market in Frankfurt, only have a limited
cash trade due to their low volume. Payouts on the 1992 profit
participation certificates are based on the Group's return on
total assets. As the return on total assets for the financial
year 2016 was 7.09 percent (previous year: 6.99 percent),
the payout on the 1992 profit participation certificates for the
financial year 2016 will be 8.09 percent of their notional value
(previous year: 7.99 percent).

The payout distribution date for both profit participation
certificates is expected to be May 15, 2017. Under the
terms and conditions of the profit participation certificates,
the auditors appointed by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA are
responsible for verifying whether amounts to be distributed
have been calculated correctly. The auditors of both profit
participation certificates provide confirmation of this.

Performance of the Group Divisions
RTL Group

RTL Group saw a positive business development, further
growing its revenues and earnings. Sales rose by 3.5 percent
to anew record level of €6.2 billion (previous year: €6.0 billion).
This growth was fueled primarily by the fast-growing digital
businesses, Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland and Groupe M6.
Operating EBITDA also reached a new high, rising by
3.7 percent to €1.4 billion (previous year: €1.4 billion),
driven by Groupe M6 and Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland.
The increase at Groupe M6 was mainly due to a positive
effect from the gradual phase-out of the M6 Mobile con-
tract. RTL Group's overall EBITDA margin was 22.5 percent
(previous year: 22.5 percent). Most of the relevant European
TV advertising markets developed positively.

Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland once again generated record
revenues and operating EBITDA. Higher advertising income from
the TV and digital businesses, the expansion of the online video
marketing sector and higher platform revenues contributed to
this growth. Although UEFA Euro 2016 and the Olympics were
aired by public broadcasters, Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland’s
family of channels recorded a stable collective audience share
of 28.4 percent (previous year: 28.4 percent) in the main target
group, simultaneously increasing the company’s lead over
the largest commercial competitor to 3.1 percentage points
(previous year: 1.7 percentage points).

In France, Groupe M6 increased its revenues primarily through
higher income from TV advertising. The flagship channel M6
improved its average audience share to 16.0 percent (previous
year: 15.4 percent), boosted among other things by the
broadcast of 11 European Soccer Championship matches.
RTL Nederland generated higher revenues, largely thanks to
increased distribution revenues; operating EBITDA was down
due to lower TV advertising revenues and higher costs.

Fremantle Media recorded a slight revenue decline due to
negative currency effects, but increased its operating result
thanks to higher earnings contributions from Asia and
Fremantle Media International. The game show “Family Feud”
was a big hit with audiences in the United States.

In 2016, RTL Group continued to invest in its three strategic
pillars of broadcasting, content and digital. RTLplus became
the most successful channel launch in recent years. In
December 2016, the channel already had a market share of
0.9 percent in the target group of viewers aged 14 to 59.
Fremantle Media acquired a majority holding in the produc-
tion company Abot Hameiri and also bought stakes in Eureka
Productions, Dr Pluto, Wild Blue Media and Dancing Ledge.
The UFA fiction series “Deutschland 83” continued its interna-
tional success with audiences and critics, as did the Wildside

18 Financial Information Combined Management Report

production “The Young Pope,” which became the most
popular premiere for a new series on Sky in Italy and launched
on Canal+ as its number-one new international drama of 2016
in France.

Thanks to strong organic and acquisitive growth, the digital
businesses for the first time contributed more than 10 percent
to RTL Group's total revenues, having grown their revenues
by 32 percent to €670 million. This was primarily due to
BroadbandTV, StyleHaul and SpotX — the businesses bundled
in the RTL Digital Hub — all of which saw dynamic growth.
Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland strengthened its position in
the digital advertising sector by acquiring a majority stake in
the online video marketer Smartclip.

Penguin Random House

Penguin Random House delivered a strong bestseller perfor-
mance in 2016, led by the multimillion-selling Paula Hawkins’s
thriller “The Girl on the Train” and the Jojo Moyes novels
“Me Before You” and “After You.” The group’s business
performance was impacted by the expected decline in e-book
sales in the United States and the United Kingdom due mostly
to new retail sales terms.

Including Verlagsgruppe Random House, the German publishing
group wholly owned by Bertelsmann, Penguin Random House
achieved a turnover of €3.4 billion in 2016 (previous year:
€3.7 billion), reflecting a year-on-year decline of 9.6 percent.
The revenue decline was mainly due to negative currency
effects and portfolio changes, as well as lower sales of print
and e-books. It was partly offset by fewer returns and positive
developments in the audio formats. The book group's operat-
ing EBITDA fell by 3.9 percent to €537 million (previous year:
€557 million); higher savings from the integration process
and lower other costs had a positive effect on earnings. The
EBITDA margin was increased again to 16.0 percent (previous
year: 15.0 percent).

In the United States, Penguin Random House publishers had
585 print and e-book titles in the “New York Times” bestseller
lists last year, including 101 at number one. In addition to
the novels by Hawkins and Moyes, the year's biggest sellers
across print, audio and digital formats included John Grisham's
“The Whistler,” Colson Whitehead’s “The Underground
Railroad” and Paul Kalanithi’s “When Breath Becomes Air.”
Multititle Dr. Seuss classics sold more than 11 million copies.

In the United Kingdom, Penguin Random House published
40 percent of all top 10 titles on the “Sunday Times” weekly
bestseller lists. Top sellers included Lee Child's “Night School,”
the classic children’s books “The BFG” and “Matilda” by
Roald Dahl, Jeff Kinney's “Wimpy Kid” series and Jamie Oliver's
cookbooks, as well as the Hawkins and Moyes titles.

Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial benefited from rising
e-book sales, a strong new-title list, and net savings from its
merger integration. In Spain, the Group grew its market share;
in Latin America, the business outperformed the market in a
challenging macro-economic environment.

In Germany, Verlagsgruppe Random House maintained its
market-leading position. The publishing group had 379 titles
on the “Spiegel” bestseller lists, including 17 at number one.
Its bestselling authors included Jonas Jonasson, Charlotte
Link and Juli Zeh.

Numerous Penguin Random House authors won internation-
ally renowned awards last year, including Pulitzer Prizes for

Fiction, History, and Autobiography and the National Book
Award for Fiction.

Bertelsmann owns 53 percent of shares in Penguin
Random House; Pearson 47 percent.

Gruner + Jahr

Despite expenditure on the transformation to digital,
Gruner + Jahr achieved an earnings turnaround by improving
its operating profit year on year. Revenues dipped 1.9 percent
to €1.6 billion (previous year: €1.6 billion), impacted both by
the general trend in the print advertising and sales market and
by changes to the portfolio, including in Austria and Spain.
However, the growth in digital revenues nearly compensated
for these organic and portfolio-driven effects. Overall, the
digital share of total revenues in the core markets of Germany
and France increased strongly. Operating EBITDA improved
by 4.6 percent to €137 million (previous year: €131 million),
driven mainly by the businesses in Germany. Against this
backdrop, the EBITDA margin rose to 8.7 percent (previous
year: 8.1 percent).

Thanks to further investments, G+J improved its revenues
as well as its results in Germany. Print advertising sales
were nearly stable, while sales revenues rose slightly. G+J
Germany's digital revenues saw strong growth. This dynamic
development was fueled by significantly higher ad sales for the
brand websites, as well as the performance marketer Ligatus.
Beyond this, there were in-house developments — such as the
AppLike marketing platform — as well as purchases, includ-
ing Ligatus's acquisition of the tech company LiquidM. The
three largest G+J websites — “Stern,” “Gala” and “Brigitte” —
each achieved record reach. G+J Germany also launched the
multichannel video network Club of Cooks and expanded its
e-commerce activities with the “Schéner Wohnen” shop.

New titles launched during the last two years — including
“Barbara” and “Stern Crime” — and the Deutsche Medien-
Manufaktur offerings also contributed to the revenue growth.
The subsidiary co-founded with the Landwirtschaftsverlag
publishing company began its work and successfully launched
two new magazines: “Essen & Trinken mit Thermomix” and
“Wolf.”

During the reporting period, G+J formed Germany's largest
content communication service provider: Territory. Through
investments into ventures such as the Webguerillas digital
agency, Territory contributed to G+J Germany's revenue
growth, as did Deutscher Pressevertrieb, which consolidated
its market position by acquiring Axel Springer Vertriebsservice.
The DDV Media Group also grew its revenues and results as
it expanded its new businesses.

G+J EMS teamed up with the RTL subsidiary IP Deutschland
to form the Ad Alliance. Under this umbrella, the marketing
agents will develop cross-genre concepts, meaning that the
two Bertelsmann subsidiaries now reach 99% of the German
population in high-end journalistic environments with their
portfolios.

20 Financial Information Combined Management Report

In France, Prisma Media's revenues and earnings remained
largely stable. Declines in the print division were nearly entirely
offset by the digital business, which increased its revenues
significantly. By acquiring Groupe Cerise, Prisma Media took
over an international digital media company with high growth
potential, while also securing the market leadership in terms
of video reach among the country’s publishing companies.

BMG

Bertelsmann’s music subsidiary BMG saw sustained growth
in the publishing and recorded music business and continued
its internationalization. Revenues rose by 12.2 percent to
€416 million (previous year: €371 million), both organic and
acquisitive. This development was driven by the publishing
business in the United Kingdom, Australia and continental
Europe; a strong recorded music business in continental
Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom; and the
worldwide increase in revenue from streaming offerings.
Operating EBITDA rose by 13.1 percent to €95 million
(previous year: €84 million), thanks to the development in the
United Kingdom and the United States. The EBITDA margin
increased to 22.8 percent (previous year: 22.6 percent).

BMG strengthened its international presence, opening branches
in Australia and Brazil. In all, BMG now has operations in
countries that account for 75% of the global music market.
Only a few months after its market entry in Australia, BMG
concluded its takeover of the music operations of Alberts, one
of the country's foremost music companies. In China, BMG
expanded its collaboration with the Alibaba Music Group to
make it easier for international artists to access to the country's
digital music platforms.

Among the most important clients newly signed to BMG
during the fiscal year was Pink Floyd founder and songwriter
Roger Waters. BMG now represents Waters’s publishing
interests in the Pink Floyd catalog, which includes the titles
“Money,” “Another Brick in the Wall” and “Comfortably
Numb.” Artists including Pitbull, Jamiroquai and Robin Schulz
also chose to have BMG represent their publishing rights
going forward. In the recorded music business, BMG signed
artists including Blink-182, Nickelback, Rick Astley, A Perfect
Circle and Max Giesinger.

Furthermore, BMG strengthened its portfolio through a
series of acquisitions and catalog acquisitions. In the United
Kingdom, for example, the acquisition of a majority stake in
the ARC Music publishing catalog secured the rights to songs
by artists including Chuck Berry, the Beach Boys and John
Lee Hooker. Here, the company also expanded its business
with the acquisition of Blondie’s catalog and acquired a
publishing catalog from the BBC. BMG also largely completed
the consolidation of its worldwide distribution of digital and
physical recorded music.

Many BMG contract partners celebrated creative successes
in 2016. In publishing, BMG songwriters helped international
artists like Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Rihanna and David Guetta
storm the charts. BMG also benefited from the success of its
clients, including Frank Ocean, Robbie Williams, DJ Snake,
Kings of Leon and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards from the

Rolling Stones. The company’s continued expansion of its
recorded music business was accompanied by chart-topping
releases — BMG went to the top of the UK charts with Rick
Astley’s album “50” and to number one in both the United
States and Britain with the album “California” by Blink-182.

Arvato

Arvato recorded a very positive business performance in 2016,
with nearly all Solution Groups growing their revenues and
results. Arvato’s revenues rose by 1.4 percent to €3.8 billion
(previous year: €3.8 billion). Despite economic challenges in
a few markets, operating EBITDA increased by 14.7 percent
to €359 million (previous year: €313 million); all Solution
Groups contributed to this. The EBITDA margin improved to
9.3 percent, after 8.3 percent in the previous year.

Effective January 1, 2016, the printing and replication busi-
nesses that were previously part of Arvato were transferred to
the newly created Bertelsmann Printing Group. At the same
time, the communications agency Medienfabrik was assigned
to Gruner + Jahr. The reorganization served to strengthen the
focus on services within the Arvato Solution Groups, which
first showed an impact in the 2016 reporting year.

Arvato CRM Solutions significantly increased both its revenues
and earnings in the 2016 financial year. This growth was fueled
mainly by new customer acquisitions in the core business
areas of IT/Internet and Tourism and the further internation-
alization of the business. A service center that can accommo-
date around 1,400 employees was opened in Gurgaon, India.

Arvato SCM Solutions massively expanded its European
logistics network, reflecting its excellent order situation.
Among other things, a new distribution center in Gennep,
Netherlands, was put into operation, the cornerstone was
laid for the building of a new site in Dorsten and the logistics
site at the Gitersloh headquarters was expanded. Beyond
this, the Solution Group expanded its services businesses
in sectors such as e-commerce, fashion & beauty, and
healthcare. Moreover, it significantly strengthened its North
American business by taking over deliveries to the United
States for a major high-tech client.

Arvato Financial Solutions, the financial services businesses
arm, also reported positive revenues and earnings. This solid
business performance was mainly due to the provision of
Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services for interna-
tional customers, the further rollout of the subsidiary AfterPay
in Europe and a steadily growing business in the core market
of Germany. To further consolidate its power to innovate,
Arvato Financial Solutions opened an IT development and
innovation center in Tallinn, Estonia, and set up a robotics lab
in Dublin, Ireland.

Arvato Systems generated a consistently high demand for
IT services and further accelerated its specialization in the core
industries of Commerce, Media and Utilities by optimizing
the portfolio while also investing in emerging fields such as
cloud infrastructure.

Bertelsmann Printing Group

Since January 1, 2016, all of Bertelsmann’s global offset and
gravure printing activities, and several other service and pro-
duction businesses, have been grouped in the Bertelsmann
Printing Group (BPG). The newly created division enjoyed a
successful year in an overall challenging market and made
progress on key integration issues.

In the 2016 financial year, the Group saw revenues fall by
6.9 percent to €1,624 million (previous year: €1,744 million).
This is mainly attributable to the sale of the Spanish printing
operations in April 2015 and the closure of Sonopress USA in
February 2016. Owing to a persistently declining print market
and as a result of divestments, operating EBITDA declined by
4.8 percent to €118 million (previous year: €124 million). At
7.3 percent, the Group’s EBITDA margin remained near the
previous year's level (previous year: 7.1 percent).

BPG’'s offset printing business remained virtually stable in
financial year 2016, at a good earnings level. Mohn Media
renewed important customer contracts in the retail segment
during the year. GGP Media, a company that specializes in
print solutions for book publishers, maintained its position in
a competitive market environment, and Vogel Druck, a BPG
subsidiary specializing in magazines and catalogs with small
to medium-size print runs, won new reference customers.

The gravure printing activities bundled in the Prinovis Group
developed positively overall. Two major new customers were
attracted in the United Kingdom. These new orders will con-
tribute to the long-term capacity utilization of the Liverpool
site. Despite persistent price pressure, the German Prinovis
sites recorded a solid business performance.

BPG’s US printers continued to face an intensely competitive
situation in the book-printing business. Declines in pocket
book production were offset by the acquisition of a major
customer in the publishing sector and by expanding the busi-
ness to new sectors with innovative print products. The US
printers’ operating result was above the previous year’s level.

Revenues at Sonopress declined as expected due to the
closure of the US site in Weaverville, North Carolina. Mean-
while, at the Gltersloh headquarters, the company bucked
the overall market trend by increasing its production volumes,
revenues and earnings against the general market trend. In
the spring, Sonopress became one of the first companies in
the world to introduce fully automated production of UHD
Blu-ray discs. By the end of 2016, it had produced more than
two million copies of the high-resolution storage media.

Bertelsmann Education Group

Bertelsmann's education holdings, grouped into the Bertelsmann
Education Group, continued their expansion last year. The
fully consolidated companies in the Education Group, which
has been an independent business division since January 1,
2016, delivered a positive performance, generating a revenue
increase of 28.9 percent to €142 million (previous year:
€110 million). Operating EBITDA fell to €-17 million (previous
year: €-5 million), mainly due to scheduled start-up losses for
the further business expansion of the Group’s holdings in the
online education services provider HotChalk and the online
learning provider Udacity, both acquired in late 2015.

The e-learning provider Relias Learning, currently Bertelsmann’s
most profitable education business, recorded significant growth,
both organically and through acquisitions. The Bertelsmann
subsidiary expanded its customer base from around 4,500 to
more than 5,500 institutions, advanced various innovations to
improve its products and expanded its business activities to new
markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany and China.
In addition, Relias made six acquisitions during the reporting
period, among other things entering the market for acute care
training by fully acquiring the US training companies Swank
HealthCare and AHC Media.

Udacity expanded the internationalization of its business and
is now active in Brazil, India and Germany. The company intro-
duced five new “nanodegrees” during the reporting period,
including its program for Self-Driving Car Engineers.

HotChalk continued its partnerships with universities in the
United States, supporting them in offering their courses to the
digital world. Several thousand students at seven universities
are currently enrolled in programs supported by HotChalk.

Alliant International University, which specializes in psychology,
recorded rising revenues in the 2016 financial year. The
university continued its transformation and began building a
range of digital courses.

Bertelsmann Investments

The Group's four strategic investment funds, forming the
division Bertelsmann Investments since January 1, 2016, further
expanded their shareholdings in international start-ups during
the year. Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI), Bertelsmann
Brazil Investments (BBI), Bertelsmann India Investments (BII)
and Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI) made a
total of 43 new investments, so that Bertelsmann held shares
in 138 companies through the funds at the end of the year.

Across all countries, the focus was on investments in start-ups
with innovative business models, for example, in the Fintech
sector. All funds contributed to identifying digital trends that are
important for the Group, supporting the portfolio companies
with the further development of innovative business models
and further strengthening Bertelsmann’s position as an
attractive partner. Since 2012, the four investment funds have
collectively invested more than €500 million in international
start-ups.

The business performance of Bertelsmann Investments is
largely measured by EBIT, which increased to €35 million
(previous year: €-14 million) in 2016. Capital gains from divest-
ments — above all at BAI — made a positive contribution to
Group profit.

In China, BAI made 27 new investments during the reporting
period and several follow-up investments in existing portfolio

companies. Many of BAI's portfolio companies provide online
services to the country’s growing middle class, including
the fitness app Keep, the dating platform Tantan, the bike-
sharing app Mobike and the Fintech company Yixin Capital.
For the first time since the fund was established, the 2016 exit
proceeds exceeded the investments during the year.

In India, Bertelsmann also further expanded its activities.
BIl invested in the fashion network Roposo, the Fintech
company Lendingkart and Treebo, a technology-enabled
branded budget hotel chain. In addition, BIl participated in
follow-up investments for existing portfolio companies such
as the university services provider iNurture and Pepperfry, an
online marketplace for furniture.

In Brazil, BBI further pursued the Group's entry into the edu-
cation business with a focus on healthcare. Together with its
strategic partner Bozano Investimentos, the fund purchased
stakes in NRE Education Group, a network of medical univer-
sities, and in Medcel, a provider of online preparatory courses
for aspiring residents.

In the financial year 2016, BDMI invested, among other
things, in the online video network FloSports. The fund
focused on the virtual reality sector, where it invested in
US companies such as 8i and Visionary VR, and German
start-up Splash.

General Statement by Company Management
on the Economic Situation

In 2016, Bertelsmann posted a positive operating performance.
The Group achieved organic revenue growth, record operating
earnings despite start-up losses for digital and new businesses,
and once again a high Group profit. In addition, Bertelsmann
made further progress in line with all of the strategic priorities.
Consequently, Bertelsmann is increasingly becoming a faster-
growing, more digital, more international and more diversified
Group.

In the reporting period, Group revenues of €17.0 billion were
1.1 percent below the previous year's figure of €17.1 billion
and thus fell short of expectations (outlook in 2015 Annual
Report: slight increase in revenues). The revenue decline is due
to exchange rate and portfolio effects. By contrast, organic
growth was 0.9 percent. Operating EBITDA of €2,568 million
(previous year: €2,485 million) recorded a positive deviation
from outlook, which despite planned start-up losses for new
and digital businesses was moderately above the previous year
(outlook in 2015 Annual Report: stable operating EBTIDA).
At €147 million, the BVA used for Group management was
considerably below the previous year’s figure of €155 million
(outlook in 2015 Annual Report: strongly declining BVA). The
expected development reflects the increase in the average
level of capital invested, which is primarily due to acquisitions;
the deviation from outlook reflects the better operating
earnings performance in the reporting period.

Bertelsmann’s four strategic priorities — strengthening the
core businesses, driving the digital transformation forward,
developing growth platforms and expanding into growth
regions — continued to be the focus of Group development
in the financial year 2016. As well as the formation of the
Ad Alliance as a cooperation in advertising marketing between
Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland and Gruner + Jahr and the
foundation of Deutsche Medien-Manufaktur by Gruner + Jahr
in conjunction with Landwirtschaftsverlag, the recently imple-
mented management structure at Bertelsmann Printing Group
and the Group-wide earnings improvement program helped to
strengthen the core businesses. As part of the digital transfor-
mation, RTL Group, among other things, took over the online
video marketer Smartclip, Gruner + Jahr took over the digital
video provider Groupe Cerise and Arvato generated growth
through services for companies in the IT/high-tech sector and
with e-commerce services. The growth platforms were further
strengthened through organic and acquisitive expansion,

26 Financial Information Combined Management Report

particularly in the music and education segments. As part of
expanding the presence in the growth regions, Bertelsmann
Investments made other new and follow-up investments and
made a positive contribution to Group profit through gains
from disposals of investments.

The net assets and financial position remained solid over the
last financial year. The maturity profile of the capital market
financings was further optimized through the issues made in
the financial year 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the cash
and cash equivalents reported at €1.4 billion (previous year:
€1.3 billion) represent sufficient liquidity. The ratings agencies
Moody's and S&P continued to rate Bertelsmann as “Baa1”
and “BBB+,” respectively, with a stable outlook. Overall,
Bertelsmann ended the financial year 2016 with a successful
performance and has a solid financial basis.

Alternative Performance Measures

In this Combined Management Report the following Alternative
Performance Measures, which are not defined in accordance
with IFRS, are used to explain the results of operations
and/or net assets and financial position. These should not be
considered in isolation but as complementary information
for evaluating Bertelsmann’s business situation and are
differentiated in terms of strictly defined and broadly defined
key performance indicators, in the same way as the value-
oriented management system.

The organic growth is calculated by adjusting the reported
revenue growth for the impact of exchange rate effects and
corporate acqusition and disposals. When determining the
exchange rate effects, the functional currency that is valid in
the respective country is used.

Operating EBITDA

Operating EBITDA is determined as earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and is
adjusted for special items. The adjustments for special items
serve to determine a sustainable operating result that could
be repeated under normal economic circumstances, which is
not affected by special factors or structural distortions. These
special items primarily include impairment losses and reversals
of impairment losses, remeasurements, restructuring expenses
and/or results from disposals of investments. This means that
operating EBITDA is a meaningful performance indicator.

BVA
BVA measures the profit realized above and beyond the

orientation is reflected in strategic investment, portfolio
planning and the management of Group operations and,
together with qualitative criteria, provides the basis for
measuring the variable portion at the Group level. BVA is
calculated as the difference between net operating profit
after tax (NOPAT) and the cost of capital. NOPAT is calculated
on the basis of operating EBITDA. NOPAT, which is used to
calculate BVA, is determined by deducting depreciation and
amortization, provided that they are not included in special
items, and a flat 33 percent tax. Cost of capital is the product
of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the
average level of capital invested. The uniform WACC after
taxes is 8 percent. The average invested capital is calculated
quarterly on the basis of the Group's operating assets
less non-interest-bearing operating liabilities. In addition,
66 percent of the net present value of operating leases is
taken into account when calculating the invested capital.

Operating free cash flow / operating EBIT

Cash Conversion Rate

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash generated
from business activities and is calculated as the ratio of operating
free cash flow to operating EBIT. The operating free cash flow
is determined on the basis of the cash flow from operating
activities as reported in the consolidated cash flow statement,
whereby the impact of paid income taxes and the change in
provisions for pensions and similar obligations on cash flow
from operating activities is offset. Operating free cash flow is
also reduced by investments in intangible assets and property,
plant and equipment or, if applicable, increased by proceeds
from the sale of non-current assets. Further adjustments are
made in order to ensure an allocation of capital flows to the
relevant periods and to offset the impact of payment flows
resulting from special items on the operating free cash flow
in a way that is methodically consistent with the operating
EBITDA. Further adjustments in the financial year 2016 mainly
reflected the impact of restructuring measures on payments.

The operating EBITDA is used to calculate the operating EBIT
by deducting amortization and depreciation, provided that
these are not included in special items. The Group aims to
maintain a cash conversion rate of 90 to 100 percent as a
long-term average

Economic Debt

Net financial debt is calculated on the basis of gross financial
debt, which is derived from the balance sheet items current
and non-current financial debt minus cash and cash equiva-
lents. Economic debt is defined as net financial debt less the
50 percent par value component of the hybrid bonds plus
provisions for pensions, profit participation capital and the
net present value of operating leases. In calculating economic
debt, the hybrid bonds are accounted for at 50 percent as
both bonds are classified by the rating agencies as 50 percent
equity. Economic debt is modified for the purposes of calcu-
lating the leverage factor.

operating EBITDA

One of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor
calculated as the ratio of economic debt to operating EBITDA
and limited to the defined maximum of 2.5. In determining
the leverage factor, the economic debt and the operating
EBITDA are modified in order to enable financial management
that corresponds to the Group’s structure and its tolerable
indebtedness. The modifications in respect of the economic
debt largely relate to cash and cash equivalents, which are
tied up in the Group while the modifications in respect of
the operating EBTIDA address the Group’s structure and its
co-shareholder shares. The leverage factor determined in
this way is thus always more conservative than the figure
that would be obtained using only the items recognized in
the balance sheet.

Significant Events After the Balance Sheet Date

At the end of January 2017, BMG took over the BBR Music
Group, which includes well-known country music labels such
as Broken Bow Records, Stoney Creek Records, Wheelhouse
Records and Red Bow Records and the music publisher Magic
Mustang Music. The takeover also included the rights to many
well-known country music artists.

British education company Pearson, which holds an interest of
47 percent in Penguin Random House, informed Bertelsmann
on February 1, 2017, of its intent to sell its shareholding and
submitted an exit notice as required by contract. As of this date,
the structured process begins during which Bertelsmann and
Pearson will initially work together to determine the market
value of Penguin Random House. Bertelsmann then has the
option to accept, refuse or not to respond to the exit notice.

Risks and Opportunities

Risk Management System

The purpose of the Bertelsmann risk management system
(RMS) is the early identification and evaluation of, as well as
response to, internal and external risks. The internal control
system (ICS), an integral component of the RMS, monitors
the effectiveness of the risk response measures that have
been implemented. The aim of the RMS is to identify, at an
early stage, material risks to the Group so that risk response
measures can be taken and controls implemented. Risks are
possible future developments or events that could result in a
negative deviation from outlook or objective for Bertelsmann.
In addition, risks can negatively affect the achievement of
the Group’s strategic, operational, reporting and compliance-
related objectives and its reputation.

The risk management process is based on the internationally
accepted frameworks of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO Enterprise
Risk Management — Integrated Framework and Internal
Control — Integrated Framework, respectively) and is organized
in subprocesses of identification, assessment, response,
control, communication and monitoring. A major element of
risk identification is a risk inventory that lists significant risks
year by year, from the profit center level upward. These risks
are aggregated step by step at the division and Group levels.
This ensures that risks are registered where their impact would
be felt. There is also a Group-wide reassessment of critical
risks every six months and quarterly reporting in case the risk
situation has changed. Ad hoc reporting requirements ensure
that significant changes in the risk situation during the course
of the year are brought to the attention of the Executive Board.
The risks are compared against risk management and control
measures to determine the so-called net risk position. Both
one- and three-year risk assessment horizons are applied to
enable the timely implementation of risk response measures.
The basis for determining the main Group risks is the three-
year period, similar to medium-term corporate planning.
Risk assessment is the product of the estimated negative
impact on Group free cash flow should the risk occur and
the estimated probability of occurrence. Risk monitoring is
conducted by Group management on an ongoing basis. The
RMS, along with its component ICS, is constantly undergoing
further development and is integrated into ongoing reporting
to the Bertelsmann Executive Board and Supervisory Board.
Corporate and Divisional Risk Management Committee

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2016 29

meetings are convened at regular intervals to ensure
compliance with statutory and internal requirements.

The auditors inspect the risk early-warning system for its
capacity to identify developments early on that could threaten
the existence of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA according to
section 91(2) of Germany's Stock Corporation Act (AktG)
and then report their findings to the Supervisory Board.
Corporate Audit conducts ongoing reviews of the adequacy
and functional capability of the RMS in all divisions apart from
RTL Group. RTL Group’s RMS is evaluated by the respec-
tive internal auditing department and by the external auditor.
Any issues that are identified are promptly remedied through
appropriate measures. The Bertelsmann Executive Board
defined the scope and focus of the RMS based on the specific
circumstances of the company. However, even an appropri-
ately designed and functional RMS cannot guarantee with
absolute certainty that risks will be identified and controlled.

Accounting-Related Risk Management System and
Internal Control System

The objectives of the accounting-related RMS and ICS are
to ensure that external and internal accounting is proper and
reliable in accordance with applicable laws and that information
is made available without delay. Reporting should also present
a true and fair view of Bertelsmann’s net assets, financial
position and results of operation. The following statements
pertain to the Consolidated Financial Statements (including
the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” and
“Combined Management Report” sections), interim reporting
and internal management reporting.

The ICS for the accounting process consists of the follow-
ing areas. The Group's internal rules for accounting and the
preparation of financial statements (e.g., IFRS manual, guide-
lines and circulars) are made available without delay to all
employees involved in the accounting process. The Group
financial statements are prepared in a reporting system that
is uniform throughout the Group. Extensive automatic system
controls ensure the consistency of the data in the financial
statements. The system is subject to ongoing development
through a documented change process. Systematized pro-
cesses for coordinating intercompany transactions serve
to prepare the corresponding consolidation steps. Circum-
stances that could lead to significant misinformation in the
Consolidated Financial Statements are monitored centrally by
employees of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and by RTL Group

30 Financial Information Combined Management Report

(for the preconsolidated subgroup) and then verified by
external experts as required. Central contact persons from
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and the divisions are also in
continuous contact with local subsidiaries to ensure IFRS-
compliant accounting as well as compliance with reporting
deadlines and obligations.

These preventive measures are supplemented by specific
controls in the form of analyses by the Corporate Financial
Reporting department of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and
RTL Group (for the preconsolidated subgroup). The purpose of
such analyses is to identify any remaining inconsistencies. The
controlling departments at the Group and division levels are
also integrated into the internal management reporting. Internal
and external reporting are reconciled during the quarterly
segment reconciliation process. The further aim in introduc-
ing a globally binding control framework for the decentralized
accounting processes is to achieve a standardized ICS format
at the level of the local accounting departments of all fully
consolidated Group companies. The findings of the external
auditors, Corporate Audit and the internal auditing depart-
ment of RTL Group are promptly discussed with the affected
companies and solutions are developed. An annual self-
assessment is conducted to establish reporting on the quality
of the ICS in the key Group companies. The findings are dis-
cussed at the divisional level. Like the RMS, each ICS cannot
guarantee with absolute certainty that significant misinforma-
tion in the accounting process can be prevented or identified.

Corporate Audit and the internal auditing department of
RTL Group evaluate the accounting-related processes as part
of their auditing work. As part of the auditing process, the
Group auditor also reports to the Audit and Finance Committee
of the Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board about
any significant vulnerabilities of the accounting-related ICS
that were identified during the audit and the findings regard-
ing the risk early-warning system.

Major Risks to the Group

Bertelsmann is exposed to a variety of risks. The major risks
to Bertelsmann identified in the risk reporting are listed in
order of priority in the table below. In line with the level
of possible financial loss, the risks are classified as low,
moderate, significant, considerable or endangering, for the
purposes of risk tolerability. The risk inventory carried out did
not identify any risks that would be classified as considerable
or endangering.

I Existing risks

Given the diversity of the businesses in which Bertelsmann is
active and the corresponding diversity of risks to which the
various divisions are exposed, the key strategic and opera-
tional risks to the Group identified below are broken down
by business segment. Risks from acquisitions and informa-
tion security risks were identified as the primary risks and are
therefore described separately. This is followed by an outline
of legal and regulatory risks and financial market risks. These
risks are largely managed at the corporate level.

Strategic and Operational Risks

In 2016, the global economy developed in line with the
previous year’s modest level of growth. In 2017, the global
economic momentum is expected to accelerate slightly. In
view of the ongoing uncertainty in the markets, Bertelsmann’s
business development is still subject to risks. Assuming
a continuing normalization of the overall economic situa-
tion, Bertelsmann expects positive development of Group
revenues for 2017. In the short to medium term, in addition to
customer risks, other significant Group risks include pricing
and discounting risks, risks from changes in the market envi-
ronment, loss of audience and market share, supplier relation-
ship risks and risks associated with economic development.
How these risks develop depends, among other things, to a
large extent on changes in customer behavior due to factors
such as the continued digitization of media, the development
and implementation of products and services by new or exist-
ing competitors, bad debt losses and default and interference
along the production chains in individual sectors, such as IT.
Employee-related risks and legal and regulatory risks are

moderate risks for Bertelsmann, while financial market risks
and risks from future technological challenges in the three-year
period under review are classified as low.

The ongoing digitization is resulting in an increasing fragmen-
tation of RTL Group's markets as audiences will have more
choice (for example, through online platforms) and, at the
same time, the market-entry barriers are being lowered. The
possible risks of this for RTL Group are decreasing audience
and advertising market shares of its advertising-financed
channels and therefore, ultimately, lower revenues. In order
to counter these risks, RTL Group is continuously revising
and developing the channels and program strategies — for
example, by establishing complementary families of channels
and constantly adapting these to international program
trends. RTL Group is addressing the risks associated with
digitization and is actively helping to shape this trend through
a range of investments in the fast-growing online video adver-
tising market. Increasing competition in the area of program
acquisition and TV production and the growing dependence
on individual production companies, coupled with the risk of
potential cost increases, could also impact RTL Group's ability
to generate revenues. This risk is being reduced by expand-
ing the program share of own productions and signing long-
term contracts with major content providers. Furthermore,
economic development directly impacts the TV advertising
markets and therefore RTL Group's revenue. This risk is
being countered by focusing on developing non-advertising
revenue streams, for example, distribution revenues from plat-
form operators. To reduce the risk of customer losses, active
customer relationship management is established.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2016 31

Falling e-book sales constitute one risk for Penguin
Random House, triggered in particular by falling sales prices
and changes to the sales conditions for e-books. Declining
sales from physical books, due to declining sales figures and
increasing margin pressure in brick-and-mortar book retail,
are another risk. Penguin Random House is countering these
risks by introducing differentiated pricing, increasing online
sales of physical books and continuously examining alter-
native marketing options. Any risk of bad debt loss is being
limited through debtor management and in some cases
through credit insurance. In addition, Penguin Random House
is finding itself exposed to the risk of cost increases. There
are also risks from general economic uncertainty, which
could lead to lower sales. Management controls these risks
through careful management of supplier relationships and by
maintaining a flexible cost structure that allows for a quick
response in the event of an economic downturn.

For Gruner + Jahr, besides the risk of a deterioration of the
overall market environment and the resulting declines in adver-
tising and circulation revenues, supplier risks represent signifi-
cant challenges. A changing market environment with price
pressure and declining revenues as a result of further concen-
tration in the agency market and more aggressive advertising
conditions may lead to falling margins. Furthermore, there is
the risk of losing key customers as advertising customers could
switch to other media, notably digital media. The risks are
being countered by active cost and customer management,
the development of new, in particular digital, forms of offer-
ings and product, price and quality improvements. Through
association work, the Group is responding to the advertising
restrictions discussed at the EU level (e.g., car advertising),
which could lead to declining advertising revenues.

Risks that affect BMG primarily concern the business structure
(including customer and supplier relations), corporate growth
(including acquisitions and integrations) and the profitable
scalability of the company (including technical platform and
organization). Market risks are addressed through high
revenue diversification (clients/catalogs, segments, regions)
and contractual protection clauses (hedging the recouping of
advances).

Arvato sees itself as particularly exposed to risks from customer
and supplier relationships and from a changing market environ-
ment. The potential loss of key customers is being countered
through contracts offering comprehensive service packages
with simultaneously flexible cost structures. On the supplier
side, a key risk is the quality of goods and services purchased.

32 Financial Information Combined Management Report

The same applies to procurement and wage costs where
these cannot be passed on to customers. Countermeasures
include entering into long-term framework agreements, an
active exchange with existing suppliers and monitoring the
supplier market. New competitors entering the market could
intensify the competitive pressure and lead to lower margins.
By developing the range of services, the aim is to improve the
competitive position and to increase customer loyalty through
integrated solutions. A worsening of the economic environ-
ment could result in declining revenues and thus lower margins,
which would necessitate cost-cutting measures and capacity
downsizing. Broad diversification across customers, sectors
and regions helps to reduce this risk. Digitization entails further
risks for individual customer segments of Arvato, particularly in
physical product distribution. These risks are being addressed,
for example, by developing digital services. Furthermore, busi-
ness segments that offer no strategic or economic prospects
are being deliberately scaled back.

For Bertelsmann Printing Group, customer risks are the most
significant risks. The aim is to minimize the risks through key
account management, entering into more flexible customer
contracts and by taking out credit insurance and utilizing
active debtor management. Furthermore, deterioration in the
economic environment also may lead to declining circula-
tions with a negative impact on earnings. In addition, price
and margin pressures result from a market environment that
is characterized by overcapacity and existing trends toward
consolidation. There are further risks on the supplier side
associated with rising raw material prices — particularly for
paper — that cannot be passed on to customers and with the
quality of the raw materials purchased. Similarly, the increasing
use of digital media is accelerating the decline in circulation.
These risk minimization strategies are based, in particular, on
constantly optimizing cost structures and making them more
flexible, as well as using price adjustment clauses, developing
new products and monitoring markets on an ongoing basis.

For the Bertelsmann Education Group, increasing competition
with other online providers, particularly in the US healthcare
market, can lead to growing price and margin pressure and
impact the planned growth targets. These risks are being
countered in particular through strategic partnerships and
marketing measures.

The key risks for Bertelsmann Investments consist of falling
portfolio valuations and a lack of exit opportunities. These
risks are being addressed through investment processes and
continuous monitoring.


--- Page 32 ---

The increasing pace of change in the markets and in
Bertelsmann's business segments means that employees will
need to be more willing and able to adapt in the future. There are
also continuing demographic risks that impact the recruitment,
development and retention of talent as a result of shifts in the
age distribution of the workforce. To counteract this, employees
are being offered further individual education, comprehensive
health programs, a competitive salary and flexible working
models. Bertelsmann is also extending its recruitment measures
and making it easier for employees to switch jobs within the
Group by harmonizing processes and structures.

Acquisition-Related Risks

The Group strategy focuses on acquisitions of businesses and
organic growth. The risk of potential mistakes when selecting
investments and the allocation of investment funds is limited by
means of strict investment criteria and processes. Acquisitions
present both opportunities and risks. For example, integration
into the Group requires one-time costs that are usually offset
by increased benefits in the long term, thanks to synergy
effects. The risks here are that the integration costs may be
higher than expected or the predicted level of synergies may
not materialize. The integration processes are therefore being
monitored by management on an ongoing basis.

Information Security Risks

For a global media company like Bertelsmann, the reliability and
security of information technology are crucial and can often
give the company a competitive edge. The ability to provide and
process information in a timely, comprehensive, error-free and
confidential way is crucial to Bertelsmann’s success. Challenges
arise, on the one hand, from the many non-standardized internal
processes and comparatively fragmented IT system landscapes
and from external potential risks such as cyber attacks, which
are still increasing dramatically in the market and competitive
environment. Bertelsmann has responded to the stricter regula-
tory conditions with an information security management
system (ISMS, based on industry standard ISO 27001), which
was introduced across the Group in 2014. The ISMS includes
regular and structured monitoring of compliance with the
regulations and systematic recording of information security
risks and deriving appropriate mitigation measures.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Bertelsmann, with its worldwide operations, is exposed to a
variety of legal and regulatory risks, for example, concerning

litigation or varying interpretations of tax assessment criteria.
Bertelsmann has television and radio operations in several
European countries that are subject to regulation. In
Germany, for example, the media is subject to oversight by
the Commission on Concentration in the Media. Bertelsmann
Group companies occupy leading market positions in many
lines of business and may therefore have limited potential
for growth through acquisition due to antitrust legislation.
Moreover, the education activities are subject to regulatory
provisions of government authorities and accreditation
bodies. These risks are being continuously monitored by the
relevant divisions within the Group.

In November 2008, RTL II filed legal actions against
IP Deutschland, a wholly owned subsidiary of RTL Group,
and Seven One Media (SOM) as a result of the 2007
proceedings of the German Federal Cartel Office against
the discount scheme agreements (“share deals”) offered by
IP Deutschland and SOM. RTL II's claim is currently limited
to access to information, on the basis of which the claim-
ants want to prove that they suffered damages from these
discount schemes. The court of first instance in Dusseldorf
decided to order an expert report. Similar proceedings of
other smaller broadcasters initiated in different courts were
unsuccessful or have been withdrawn.

In June 2016, the main competitors of Fun Radio alleged
that a host of the morning show had influenced Fun Radio's
audience ratings by encouraging his listeners to give favorable
treatment to Fun Radio in the Médiamétrie surveys. In response
to these allegations, Médiamétrie called a special commit-
tee, which ultimately decided to remove Fun Radio from
Médiamétrie’s survey to be published in July 2016. Following
a legal procedure initiated by Fun Radio, Médiamétrie was
required to reinstate Fun Radio in the ratings surveys as from
September 2016 but, since then, decided to lower Fun Radio's
audience results, arguing a possible “halo effect.” Thereafter,
Fun Radio initiated a procedure to challenge the scientific reli-
ability of the Médiamétrie calculation. In December 2016, the
main competitors of Fun Radio also filed a claim for damages
claiming unfair competition.

Foreign investments in the People’s Republic of China
are highly regulated. In view of this, in order to secure
Bertelsmann’s rights, it is standard market practice to invest
through so-called VIE structures. However, there is the risk
that it will not be possible to safeguard such structures
through Chinese courts particularly if the People’s Republic
changes its policies toward foreign investments or if courts

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2016 33


--- Page 33 ---

and authorities change their case law or administrative prac-
tice. A draft of a revised “PRC Foreign Investment Law” is
being discussed politically. It is not yet clear to what extent
Chinese investment policy will change as a result of this. The
draft stipulates a wide-reaching ban on trust structures in
regulated markets. However, there is also no provision what-
soever for dealing with existing trust structures. In an extreme
case, it is conceivable that the total investment could be lost.
In the past, however, such measures have only been reported
in exceptional cases. By contrast, observers are anticipating
solutions that will only have a minor impact on the Chinese
economy. These developments would affect BMG, Arvato,
Gruner + Jahr and Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI).

Aside from the matters outlined above, no further significant
legal and regulatory risks to Bertelsmann are apparent at this
time.

Financial Market Risks

As an international corporation, Bertelsmann is exposed to
various forms of financial market risk, especially interest rate and
currency risks. These risks are largely controlled by the Central
Financial Department on the basis of guidelines established
by the Executive Board. Derivative financial instruments are
used solely for hedging purposes. Bertelsmann uses currency
derivatives mainly to hedge recorded and future transactions
involving foreign currency risk. Some firm commitments
denominated in foreign currency are partially hedged when
they are made, with the hedged amount increasing over time.
A number of subsidiaries are based outside the eurozone. The
resulting translation risk is managed based on economic debt
in relation to operating EBITDA (leverage factor). Bertelsmann’s
long-term focus is on the maximum leverage factor permitted
for the Group. Foreign currency translation risks arising from
net investments in foreign entities are not hedged. The cash
flow risk from interest rate changes is centrally monitored
and controlled as part of interest rate management. The aim
is to achieve a balanced ratio of different fixed interest rates
through the selection of appropriate maturity periods for the
originated financial assets and liabilities affecting liquidity
and through the ongoing use of interest rate derivatives.
Liquidity risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference
to the budget for current and future years. The syndicated
loan and appropriate liquidity provisions form a sufficient
risk buffer for unplanned payments. Counterparty risks exist
in the Group in an amount equivalent to the invested cash
and cash equivalents and in the default of a counterparty in

34 Financial Information Combined Management Report

derivatives transactions. Financial transactions and financial
instruments are restricted to a rigidly defined group of banks
with a high credit rating (Investment Grade). Within the
guidelines, a risk limit specified by the Bertelsmann Executive
Board has been issued for financial assets and derivatives
for each counterparty. Compliance with this limit is regularly
monitored by the Central Financial Department. The guidelines
concerning the investment of cash and cash equivalents
are continuously monitored and extended if necessary. The
financial investments are generally made on a short-term
basis so that the investment volume can be reduced if the
credit rating changes. Overall, the financial market risks are
estimated as low.

General Statement on the Risk Situation

The risks identified in the financial year 2016 are not endan-
gering. Neither are there any substantial risks discernible that
could threaten the existence of the Group.

The overall risk position has slightly reduced compared to
December 31, 2015. The major risks to the Group have not
changed compared to the previous year. In particular, pricing
and discounting risks, customer and supplier relationship
risks, a changing market environment and volatile economic
development still constitute the key Group challenges. How-
ever, as a result of the diversification of Group businesses,
there are no concentration risks stemming from dependency
on individual business partners or products in either procure-
ment or sales. The Group’s financial position is solid, with
liquidity needs covered by existing liquidity and available
credit facilities.

Opportunity Management System

An efficient opportunity management system enables
Bertelsmann to secure its corporate success in the long term
and to exploit potential in an optimum way. Opportunities are
possible future developments or events that could result in a
positive deviation from outlook or objective for Bertelsmann.
The opportunity management system, like the RMS, is an
integral component of the business processes and company
decisions. During the strategy and planning process, signifi-
cant opportunities are determined each year from the profit
center level upward, and then aggregated step by step at the
division and Group levels. By systematically recording them
on several reporting levels, opportunities that arise can be
identified and exploited at an early stage. This also creates an


--- Page 34 ---

interdivisional overview of Bertelsmann’s current opportuni-
ties. A review of major changes in opportunities is conducted
at the divisional level every six months. In addition, the largely
decentralized opportunity management system is coordinated
by central departments in the Group in order to derive syner-
gies through targeted cooperation in the individual divisions.
The interdivisional experience transfer is reinforced by regular
meetings of the GMC.

Opportunities

While the above-mentioned opportunities associated with
positive development may be accompanied by correspond-
ing risks, certain risks are entered into in order to be able to
exploit potential opportunities. This link to the key Group risks
offers strategic, operational, legal, regulatory and financial
opportunities for Bertelsmann.

Strategic opportunities can be derived primarily from the
Group's four strategic priorities. Strengthening core busi-
nesses, driving forward the digital transformation, developing
growth platforms and expanding in growth regions consti-
tute the most important long-term growth opportunities for
Bertelsmann (see the “Strategy” section). In particular, there
are opportunities in some cases for exploiting synergies as
a result of the strategic portfolio expansions. There is poten-
tial for efficiency improvements in the individual divisions and
individual operational opportunities in addition to the possibil-
ity of more favorable economic development.

For RTL Group, a better-than-expected development of the
TV advertising markets and higher audience and advertis-
ing market shares are major opportunities. Furthermore, the
increasing digitization and fragmentation of the media land-
scape are opening up opportunities. Professionally produced
content can be distributed across multiple platforms nationally
and internationally. New revenue streams could be generated
by exploiting existing TV content across different platforms
and by creating native digital content. Also, with an increased
presence in the digital sector, RTL Group could increase online
video advertising sales on all devices and TV platforms and
establish pay models in the on-demand business. In this way,
new advertising sales could be generated through the offering
of new interactive or targeted forms of advertising (HbbTV,
IPTV or mobile television). As an established content producer
with a global presence, RTL Group could further expand its
digital distribution through multichannel networks and digital
streaming platforms.

The combination of Penguin and Random House has enhanced
the publishing opportunities for Penguin Random House.
With market share gains, the publishing group could further
increase its leading market position, attract new authors and
publish the industry's most successful debut publications.
Especially in emerging and multilingual markets, the publish-
ing group could take advantage of the fast-growing demand
and offer its products to the widest possible readership.
Further acquisitions could also offer significant opportunities
for growth. In this context, Penguin Random House could
also generate greater synergies through the integration of the
acquired businesses. The increasing digitization of the book
markets offers opportunities for new product development
and more efficient marketing channels. The development of
new products and enhancements to existing offerings could
make books more appealing to a wider audience and offer
new experiences to readers. Moreover, building networks and
tools could help authors to connect better with their readers.

For Gruner + Jahr, a better development of the advertising
and sales markets represents significant opportunities. The
transformation from magazine publisher to content house is
providing further opportunities. The organizational structure
of G+J Germany integrates the printing and digital businesses,
thus allowing it to implement product innovations faster and
more efficiently. Besides the expansion and development of
existing media brands, there are opportunities for growth,
particularly in the development and expansion of digital activities
and in cooperation with other publishers and marketers. There
are also opportunities for developing additional services, such
as commerce and paid services. In terms of marketing, G+J
could gain new customers through new forms of advertising
in the online, mobile and video media channels. Developing
new special advertising formats and implementing integrated
campaigns could also help to attract potential new customers.

Further takeovers of music rights catalogs and additional
signings of contracts with artists, which could be managed
on the existing platform at marginal cost, offer growth
opportunities for BMG. The accelerated market penetration of
streaming offerings also offers the opportunity for expansion
of the recorded music and music publishing markets at an
international level.

At Arvato, interdivisional cooperation can provide additional
opportunities for acquiring new customers, particularly key
international customers. The global e-commerce market will
continue its dynamic growth over the next few years as a result

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2016 35

of ongoing digitization. Arvato could benefit significantly
from this growth, primarily through new services offered by
the Solution Groups SCM and Financial Solutions. Further
growth opportunities from the digital transformation lie in pro-
viding support to customers with CRM solutions via multiple
digital channels and in developing and providing cloud-based
IT services.

The Bertelsmann Printing Group businesses may decline less
steeply through additional volumes of existing and new cus-
tomers. This would provide opportunities from the targeted
servicing of market segments that are still growing. Moreover,
the prospect of further consolidation of the printing market
could effectively strengthen Bertelsmann Printing Group's
market position.

The education business is being developed as Bertelsmann’'s
third earnings pillar, alongside the media and service
businesses. Rapidly growing markets in online education,
focusing on the healthcare and technology segments, offers
further growth opportunities. The education business could
benefit from a faster shift away from the traditional class-
room-based delivery methods toward online and skill-based
trainings, in addition to a general increase in the demand
for training in the healthcare and technology segments.
Businesses of Bertelsmann Education Group also have
organic growth opportunities. Relias Learning has the poten-
tial to grow through further penetration in its core verticals,
the development of employee assessments and data analytics
products, and the expansion into global healthcare markets.
Udacity benefits from the rapid obsolescence of content in
the technology sector, which creates a steady demand for
further education from the labor market. This, along with
the shortage of qualified IT staff with the right skills, gives
Udacity the opportunity to develop into a premium brand in
the |T/technology training sector. Finally, HotChalk offers a
range of services that are targeted at the growing number of
universities that are increasingly offering university programs
online and are looking to outsource selected services.

For the Bertelsmann Investments fund activities, there is the
opportunity to realize higher-than-expected profits, thanks to
increasing portfolio valuations or exit options.

The current innovation efforts detailed in the “Innovations”
section offer further potential opportunities for the individual

divisions.

Other opportunities could arise from changes to the legal and
regulatory environment.

The financial opportunities are largely based on a favorable
development of interest and exchange rates from Bertelsmann’s
point of view.

Outlook

Anticipated Overall Economic Development

Bertelsmann anticipates that economic conditions will develop
as follows in 2017. Overall, the global economy will expand
slightly faster. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW)
estimates that global production will increase by 3.5 percent
in 2017, compared to 3.1 percent in 2016. The outlook for
economic development on a global level continues to be
overshadowed by a number of factors, including the adverse
effects of low raw materials prices for raw material-exporting
countries, the gradual realignment of the Chinese economy
and a wide range of political uncertainties. By contrast, the
continuing accommodative monetary policy overall will help
to stimulate the economy.

In the eurozone, the economic recovery is set to continue even
if downward risks remain. The IfW estimates real economic
growth of 1.7 percent in 2017. The IfW also expects GDP for
Germany to grow by 1.7 percent in real terms. It expects the
growth rate in France to be 1.2 percent in real terms. For the
United Kingdom, GDP is expected to rise at a lower pace by
1.2 percent in real terms in 2017. For the United States, real
economic growth of 2.5 percent is expected, thanks to the
continuing economic momentum.

Anticipated Development in Relevant Markets

The worldwide media industry is primarily influenced by
global economic developments and the resulting growth
dynamic. The continued trend toward digitization of content
and distribution channels, changes in media usage and the
increasing influence of emerging economies will continue
to present risks and opportunities in the years to come.
Through the intended transformation of the Group portfolio
in line with the four strategic priorities, Bertelsmann expects
to benefit to an increasing extent from the resulting oppor-
tunities. Through its businesses, Bertelsmann operates in a
variety of different markets and regions whose developments
are subject to a range of factors and that do not respond in
a linear fashion to overall economic tendencies. The follow-
ing takes into account only those markets and regions that
are large enough to be relevant for forecasting purposes
and whose expected development can be appropriately

aggregated and evaluated or that are strategically important
from a Group perspective.

For 2017, with the exception of continued significant growth in
Spain and a slightly declining development in the Netherlands
and Hungary, the European TV advertising markets are
expected to remain stable or to show slight growth. In the
book markets, an overall stable development is expected.
In the magazine business, the print advertising and circula-
tion markets in Germany and France are expected to decline
further in 2017, while continued growth is expected in the
digital segment. For 2017, continuing moderate growth of
the global music market is expected in the publishing and
recording rights segments. In 2017, the services markets are
expected to achieve growth similar to the previous year. The
relevant European print markets and the North American book
printing market are likely to show continued decline in 2017.
For the US education markets, continuing strong growth is
expected in the relevant segments overall.

Expected Business Development

The global economy is on a moderate growth path. However,
economic prospects continue to be subject to certain risks. The
following expectations are therefore based on the assumption
that the recovery of the overall economic situation will con-
tinue and that most of the forecasted market developments
and the economic predictions of the research institutions will
be realized.

For the financial year 2017, Bertelsmann anticipates that
business development will be driven by the slightly positive
market expectations for the European TV advertising markets,
by stable book markets and by continuously growing service
markets. The growth stimuli created through strategic port-
folio expansions will continue to have a positive impact on
Bertelsmann’s growth profile.

In addition to the assumed market developments, the
predicted economic developments in the geographic core
markets of Western Europe and the United States are the
basis of the expected business development. With revenue
and earnings share within the eurozone expected at around
two-thirds, the extent of growth is above all based on the
forecasted real and nominal economic development in this
economic zone. The IfW therefore assumes that GDP in
the eurozone will increase by 3.2 percent in nominal terms
and by 1.7 percent in real terms for 2017. The OECD predicts
that GDP in the eurozone will increase by 2.8 percent in
nominal terms and by 1.6 percent in real terms for 2017. In

view of these economic expectations, Bertelsmann expects
Group revenues to increase slightly in the financial year 2017.
Operating EBITDA is expected to show stable development in
the financial year 2017. The average level of capital invested
will continue to increase in the financial year 2017 as a result
of ongoing acquisition activity. As a result of the growth
profile of the acquired businesses, compensating effects
from earnings contributions are not expected to materialize
for some time. Consequently, a strong fall in BVA is expected
for the Group.

At present, the expected performance of any individual unit of
key significance for the Bertelsmann Group is not expected to
deviate significantly from that of the Group.

Depending on how the economy develops, Bertelsmann does
not currently anticipate interest rate changes to have any
material impact on the average financing costs of medium-
to long-term financing. The liquidity situation in the forecast
period is expected to be sufficient.

These forecasts are based on Bertelsmann’s business strategy,
as outlined in the “Company Profile” section. In general, the
forecasts reflect careful consideration of risks and opportuni-
ties and are based on operational planning and the medium-
term outlook for the corporate divisions. All statements
concerning potential economic and business developments
represent opinions advanced on the basis of the information
that is currently available. Should underlying assumptions fail
to apply and/or further risks arise, actual results may differ
from those expected. Accordingly, no assurances can be
provided concerning the accuracy of such statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA (in accordance with
HGB, German Commercial Code)

In addition to the Group reporting, the business develop-
ment of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is outlined below.
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is a parent company and a
management holding company of the Bertelsmann Group.
Its tasks include management functions for the Bertelsmann
Group as well as the management of its investments and
financing. There are also service functions for individual divi-
sions within the Corporate Center. It also bears the tax liability
for most of the subsidiaries in Germany. The position of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is essentially determined by the
business success of the Bertelsmann Group.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2016 37


--- Page 37 ---

The Annual Financial Statements of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA, in contrast to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, have not been prepared in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) but in
accordance with the regulations of the German Commercial
Code (HGB) and the supplementary regulations of the German
Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

Results of Operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

As a result of the definition of revenues amended by the
“Accounting Directive Implementation Act” (BiIRUG), the format
for the income statement and the reporting of particular
types of expenses and income (including the previous year’s
amounts shown) were adapted. Accordingly, the income from
services that are atypical for the business (including leasing
and rental) will be reported under revenues, and the expenses
that are directly attributable to this income will be reported
under cost of materials.

The results of operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA will
continue to be significantly affected by the amount of income
from other participations. With an increase in income from
other participations, the fall in the net income of €88 million
is primarily attributable to the increase in taxes on income of
€98 million as a result of a corporate income tax loss carryfor-
ward that was fully used up.

The decrease in other operating income by €96 mainly results
from a reduction in write-ups on shares in Bertelsmann Inc.,
Wilmington (2016: €53 million, previous year: €143 million).

The increase in the income from other participations in the
reporting period is characterized in particular by the con-
trasting development of the net income of two key subsid-
iaries with which profit and loss transfer agreements exist.
Income of €118 million was generated from the existing profit
and loss transfer agreement with Reinhard Mohn GmbH,
Gltersloh, in the financial year 2016. For the previous year, a
loss of €146 million had to be assumed as a result of write-
downs of investment carrying amount of a subsidiary of
Reinhard Mohn GmbH, Gutersloh. The profits contributed by
Bertelsmann Capital Holding GmbH, GUtersloh, declined year
on year (2016: €691 million, previous year €863 million).

Net Assets and Financial Position of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA

The increase in intangible and tangible assets to €359 million
(previous year: €322 million) mainly resulted from the acqui-
sition of land and buildings for leasing to subsidiaries. The
increase in long-term financial assets of €358 million to
€14,714 million primarily concerns the change in the carrying
amount of shares in affiliated companies by €678 million in
connection with the payment of contributions to subsidiaries.
In the financial year 2016, the investment carrying amount of
Bertelsmann Capital Holding GmbH, Gutersloh, increased by
€422 million due to a payment made by Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA in connection with the profit and loss transfer
agreement between Bertelsmann Capital Holding GmbH,
Gitersloh, and RTL Group Deutschland GmbH, Cologne.
The loans to affiliated companies fell by €500 million as
a result of an intercompany disposal of a loan granted to

RTL Group Deutschland GmbH, Cologne in the reporting
period. The increase in receivables and other assets includes
€1,031 million of receivables from affiliated companies. The
increase primarily concerns the receivable from Reinhard
Mohn GmbH, Gutersloh, in connection with the transfer of
an intercompany financing function to a subsidiary of this
company.

The equity of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA increased to
€9,322 million as a result of the net income of the report-
ing year by €450 million, less distributions to shareholders
by €180 million. The increase in provisions to €484 million
is mainly attributable to increased provisions for taxes. Of
the liabilities, liabilities to affiliated companies account for
€5,439 million, which increased by €923 million during the
reporting period. The amount of the loan granted to sub-
sidiaries of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is affected by the
development of the business and financial position of these
subsidiaries.

Risks and Opportunities for Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

As Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is largely linked to the
Bertelsmann Group companies, among other things through
the financing and guarantee commitments as well as through
direct and indirect investments in the subsidiaries, the situation
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA in terms of risks and opportu-
nities is primarily dependent on the risks and opportunities of

the Bertelsmann Group. In this respect, the statements made
by corporate management concerning the overall assessment
of the risks and opportunities also constitute a summary of the
risks and opportunities of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA (see
the “Risks and Opportunities” section).

Outlook for Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

As the parent company of the Bertelsmann Group,
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA receives dividend distributions
from its subsidiaries as well as income from services provided
to them. Consequently, the performance of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA is primarily determined by the business perfor-
mance of the Bertelsmann Group (see the “Outlook” section).
