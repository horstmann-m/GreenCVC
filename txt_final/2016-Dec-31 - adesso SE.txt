announces strong growth for the previous year with
a continuing trend. This company was founded in
2013 and has since been providing hosting and cloud
services for the secure operation of customised busi-
ness-critical applications. One essential driver of
growth for the financial year 2015 was adesso hosting

How do you write a real history of success? What
are the necessary elements? Can you learn how to
be successful? Or is business success for the most
part the result of a company’s original disposition, its
founding principles and the talent it recruits?

Don’t worry: we are not about to become overly
philosophical in the year of our 20th anniversary,
rather, we are sticking to our tried and tested focus
on practice. And if there were a patented recipe for
business success, it would still be difficult to gain a
competitive advantage, as it would make it almost
impossible to make any real differentiation in the
market for information technology services and
solutions.

However, we think that it is not without reason that
our disposition has managed to uphold adesso’s
business model for over 20 years and we believe
that it has led to our considerable growth. Our
focus on employees and customers, the way we
combine research, teaching and practice, and the
expertise that this gives rise to, but above all our
special company culture, are adesso’s fundamental
components - its disposition for success. We have
consciously cultivated these values, constantly
tended to them and will continue to apply them
consistently. This is what enables us to utilise the
right combination of technological expertise and
experience to help our customers with their software
projects. The resulting confitlence is the foundation
of the way that adesso hasibeenable to develop its
market share year after yeahaWhich makes us grateful
and also a little bit proud. In 2017 te year of our
20th anniversary, and with a current team of more
than 2,100 employees, adesso is one of the largest
IT service providers in the German-speaking world.

Recruiting

Consulting and customised software development
are an absolute “people business”. You need little
more than competent, motivated employees and a
suitable IT infrastructure. It sounds simple, but in an
environment characterised by a shortage of skilled
professionals, this is anything but easy if you want
to hire the cream of the highly qualified crop. Since
adesso’s listing on the stock market 10 years ago, the
company has grown by an average of more than 21%
per year, for the most part organically.

One of adesso’s keys to success is the fact that it
has been able to recruit the right number of experts
to enable growth like this. To do so, we have put our
shoulder to the wheel. In 2016, adesso was awarded
the title of Best Employer for a company of its size
in the information and telecommunications industry.
In the year under review, we registered more than
11,000 applications, which then entered the adesso
selection process with its very high quality standards.
This testifies to adesso’s growing attractiveness as
an employer. In 2017, we intend to once again hire 365
new permanent employees (internal programme: one
employee per day).

Professional development

In light of a sustained shortage of qualified pro-
fessionals and adesso’s strong growth rate, we
are barely able to fulfil our huge requirements for
experienced employees who are optimally qualified
to perform their respective tasks through the labour
market alone. Moreover, innovation cycles in the IT
sector are short. Nevertheless, young graduates can
expect exciting projects, tasks that allow them to
take on responsibility right away, and good career
prospects. With targeted training and further edu-
cation programmes based on our needs, adesso is
able to fulfil a diverse range of requirements. At a
very early stage, adesso conceived of its own further
education programmes alongside a comprehensive
training programme. At the “academy”, selected
employees can take part in a 1.5-year interdiscipli-
nary academy programme that accompanies them
on their career paths. There are also other targeted
training programmes in place, for example, for project
managers, software architects and managers. In 2016
alone, adesso enabled more than 3,000 employees to
take part in training. adesso’s transparent culture of
knowledge is also beneficial in this respect. It allows
employees to learn from one another, and internal
tutors enjoy sharing their knowledge with the team.
This means that adesso can take action based on
cutting-edge, up-to-date knowledge while offer-
ing employees first-class projects and good career
prospects in a dynamic company. Combined with its
unique company culture (see page 30, this ensures
a below-average turnover rate and highly motivated
employees.

CUSTOMER
FOCUS

Long-term customer
relationships

Customer satisfaction is a topic that is very close
to our hearts. It is a complex issue, which requires
problem-solving expertise, professional collaboration,
open communication, confidence that goals will be
reached, planning security and appropriate remu-
neration. Only those who are able to empathise with
a customer’s situation can really understand their
motivations and act to the benefit of the customer’s
long-term satisfaction. When optimising customers’
key business processes, the dominant factor is not
the price - what counts most is the result. Customer
relationships, some of which have been in place for
over 10 years, prove that customers appreciate the
quality of our work and our personal adesso style.
adesso has been working with one of its major cus-
tomers, the BITMARCK Group, for more than 14 years.
In this way, adesso has played a significant role in the
projects of Germany’s largest full-service provider in
the IT market of the statutory health-insurance pro-
viders. Due to its exceptional expertise and extensive
experience, adesso also has the confidence of major
customers in the state lottery sector. Even after 19
years of collaboration, these clients include West-
Lotto, one of adesso’s first major customers, and
adesso has been working with Swisslos sinees2006.
A promising and entirely innovativagtandard sott-
ware product for the life insurancesegment emerged
from its successful business relationship With Barme-
nia Versicherungen (a customer/Since 2007).

adesso Group

Annual Report 2016

An atmosphere of appreciation

adesso has taken part in the “Germany’s Best
Employer” awards five times and has finished as
one of the best companies in its industry every time.
In 2016, it was awarded first place among the major
companies in the information and telecommunica-
tions sector. It received high scores for the areas of
team spirit, fairness, pride and respect, which reflect
our company culture. We place great value on culti-
vating a friendly, relaxed environment shaped by a
sense of community, and put our emphasis on an
open exchange of information and reciprocal support.
What is special about working at adesso is its high
regard it has for every single employee’s everyday
achievements. This includes, in particular, its special
ability to integrate new employees into the existing
adesso team. It doesn’t matter whether the new col-
league is fresh out of university or is bringing years
of practical experience with them. Everybody is wel-
come and receives optimal preparation for their role
within the adesso Group during its informative and
integrative Welcome Days mentoring programme, as
well as the appropriate equipment and access. This
applies in particular to the employees of companies
that have been acquired by adesso, because our com-
pany culture, shaped by openness, does not stop at
the boundaries of our organisational units.

Flat hierarchies, a company open-door policy, quick
decision-making processes and reciprocal support
when answering questions are other key elements
that allow us to compete dynamically and flexibly.
At adesso, it is always the argument that counts and
not the position of the person using it. This is also
reflected in the first-name basis that applies to all
levels of the hierarchy. A culture that is this beneficial
needs to be maintained, which is where our written
management principles and adesso values come in.
Team building exercises such as joint excursions and
parties, and an eye for the small details that make
the working day that bit more pleasant, round off
this coherent overall picture.

Entrepreneurial thinking
The nucleus
of growth

Successful business is based on innovative ideas
and solid technologies, as well as on committed
people who combine these two things at the highest
level. Thinking outside the box of our own projects,
regularly exchanging information with colleagues and
experts, and creating space for innovation - this is
what enables continuous progress and secures our
technological lead. Since its founding, the entire
adesso Group, including all of its organisational
units, have been geared towards growth. The focus
here is by no means simply on the employee’s own
area of responsibility, but on the big picture. Because,
alongside the typical growth initiatives that focus on
specific business divisions, the way that available
expertise is connected within the company group and,
above all, the way that models that have been suc-
cessfully applied are transferred to other sectors and
technologies provides a diverse range of development
opportunities. This requires absolute team players
but sometimes lateral thinkers too. It also requires an
incentive system that also honours the initiative that
employees take outside their own area of responsibil-
ity. Promising ideas are openly discussed, tested and,
if possible, implemented in practice.

There are more than enough examples of this in
adesso’s history, for example the platform drebis,
which was successfully established to carry out the
standardised exchange of information between law-
yers and legal protection insurers. The expansion of
adesso’s successful health insurance solution PS|Life
into a complete, multidisciplinary product family is
a result of this philosophy of growth. adesso also
provides sufficient space and support for strategic
initiatives like this, including the necessary equip-
ment and staff where needed. Committed employees
who are fascinated by technological advances have
the opportunity to implement their own ideas and
plans. Companies organised within the adesso Group
also complement each other to the extent that they
can handle interdisciplinary calls for projects or pro-
ject requests.

Technological competence

Blessed with
talent

Talent is hereditary. adesso’s close contact to a uni-
versity blessed it with special technological expertise
from the very start, and adesso has fostered and
developed this talent enthusiastically. For example,
at the end of the 1990s, adesso set up the first inven-
tory control system using Java technology, which was
still very new at that point, for an insurance provider
in the German market. It was a feat of technological
daring that we were warned about at the time, but it
helped adesso to write history as a trailblazer, mark-
ing a milestone in the development of the company.
Trusting our instincts and our special expertise paid
off. Since then, the world of technology has contin-
ued to develop rapidly. adesso has invested a lot in
fostering its special talents. The result of thisis a
company where one thing has always been clear: the
foundation of its business is its expertise in state-of-
the-art technologies. When adesso helps companies
with the Internet of Things or to digitally transform,
its consultants and developers can make use of a
solid portfolio of technologies, which is all state of
the art but has also been extensively tried and tested.
This has also made adesso’s employees sought-after
authors for specialist magazines throughout the IT
spectrum. We do not keep our knowledge secret, but
rather share it with the community, which leads to
productive discussions and new ideas.

EXPERTISE

But we have to be able to apply technology too. This
means managing risks and working efficiently. 20
years of experience have given rise to a method that
combines these two aspects. We have been imple-
menting our software projects agilely for many years
now. This requires us to be goal-oriented, but it also
poses challenges, in particular as customers want
to have budget security. The adesso adVANTAGE
approach lets us combine the two. Internal monitor-
ing and management processes have also reached a
level of maturity that makes adesso projects espe-
cially secure.

Specialist expertise

It’s all about the
right combination

There is an expert for almost every challenge among
our more than 2,000 adesso employees. adesso’s
tight industry focus over the years now means that
adesso consultants are able to understand every
particular of their customers’ business. They are able
to identify best practices and industrial standards
for countless questions of detail. Or they sketch out
fully customised solutions, depending on what the
customer's specific situation requires. adesso’s pro-
ject teams are interdisciplinary in their make-up. For
example, insurance mathematicians work alongside
specialists in requirements engineering together
with sales specialists. Its particularly intensive
professional development programme (see page 27)
ensures that software developers and technology
experts understand customers’ specialist processes
in just as much detail, and we put together a special
combination of different competencies for each pro-
ject. Always on board: 20 years of experience.

GROUP PRINCIPLES

Business Model, Targets and
Strategies

adesso Group is a fast growing IT company which
has set its sights on becoming one of the leading con-
sulting and technology groups for industry-specific
business processes in Central Europe. With a high
level of expertise in the areas it caters to, adesso oper-
ates at the interface between business processes and
IT, implementing software projects at the highest
technical level. The development of its own soft-
ware solutions increases market penetration and
strengthens the company’s position in promising
IT fields, such as mobilisation and enterprise con-
tent management. adesso pursues the internation-
alisation of its own product sales as a strategic goal.
Enterprise development is complemented by a well-
defined acquisition strategy.

Fuelled by past growth and growth in the making, a
focused business model and an insistence on outper-
forming industry average margins, adesso Group’s
value is continually being enhanced. To achieve this,
we invest significant resources in targeted business
development, the expansion of sales capacities,
recruiting and marketing. These investments, cou-
pled with extensive industry and consulting exper-
tise, enable growth rates which exceed the industry
average by far.

We are a leading technology group in the field of
software development and invest more than aver-
age in the training and development of our work-
force and in the ongoing development of the adesso
model for the software development process.

The Executive Board is committed to a strategy
of striving for the right balance of growth, solid
finances and profitability.

For 2016, the Executive Board targeted sales growth
of 12 %to 18 % to EUR 220 million to EUR 232 mil-
lion, stable operating profit measured as EBITDA of
between EUR 14.5 million and EUR 17.0 million
and an increased minimum EBITDA margin of 6.5 %
compared to the previous year. All targets were met
and even exceeded.

Employees and
Structure

Founded in 1997, adesso had a total of 2,174
employees (FTE) (previous year: 1,702) in Ger-
many, Austria, Switzerland, Turkey and the USA at
the end of 2016. While the adesso Group employed
248 (previous year: 246) staff members outside of
Germany, 1,234 (previous year: 1,058) employees
were deployed in Germany and work for the parent
company, adesso AG, which is both by far the largest
operating unit and the holding company.

adesso AG’s largest location is Dortmund, which is
also the city in which the company was founded and
where its corporate headquarters are located. To stay
close to its customers and keep travel times and costs
as low as possible, adesso maintains fourteen other
offices in all of Germany’s major economic regions.
This broad local presence is also extremely important
in terms of recruitment. International sites include
Bern, Boston, Istanbul, London, Vienna and Zurich.
Further sites are scheduled to open in Aachen, Basel
and Essen in 2017.

In addition to adesso AG, the largest operating unit
and parent company, adesso Group also includes 23
majority-owned companies, consolidated second-
tier subsidiaries and a minority interest as at the
reporting date.

adesso has two different segments: IT Services and
IT Solutions. While the IT Services segment offers
customised, project-oriented services in the areas of
consulting and software development, the IT Solu-
tions businesses market their own solutions in the
shape of home-grown products or standard software
products.

The parent company adesso AG is publicly traded
and listed on nearly all German stock exchanges
(ISIN code: DEO00A0Z23Q5, WKN [national secu-
rity identification number]: AOZ23Q).
GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Group Principles
Economic Report

Management System

As the spearhead of adesso Group, adesso AG defines
the strategy and operational targets of all group com-
panies. It controls the legally independent group
companies by implementing a target system, an
ongoing reporting process and by occupying posi-
tions in the supervisory bodies and management
teams.

Operational control is ensured by a reporting system
which has been implemented group-wide. In the
process, each group company prepares full monthly
financial statements based on national legal regu-
lations. Key performance figures for reporting are
sales, EBITDA, earnings before tax (EBT), the EBT
margin, number and proportion of employees not
fully utilised, number of employees and net liquid-
ity. The most important performance indicators are
subject to continuous comparisons with plan and
actual data. All indicators are carried forward and
subject to an internal group benchmark. An updated
rolling forecast is prepared per Group company for
the entire year so that possible planning deviations
can be identified in a timely manner. Fixed report-
ing channels and cycles have been defined and there
is also a fixed appointment schedule for manage-
ment meetings. There are no fundamental differ-
ences between key performance indicators in the
reporting systems for each segment.

Research and Development

The bulk of adesso Group’s turnover is generated
through its sales in IT services. With few exceptions,
adesso solutions represent the core of project solu-
tions which are then tailored to customer require-
ments in client-specific projects. Research expenses
in IT Solutions segment are negligible in relation to
group expenses. None of the group companies has
its own dedicated research department.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT

ECONOMIC REPORT

Macroeconomic Climate and
Industry-specific Conditions

Macroeconomic Climate

Economic growth in Germany accelerated slightly
again in 2016. According to initial calculations by
the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), gross domes-
tic product (GDP) growth is expected to increase to
1.9% for 2016 following on from growth of 1.7 % in
the previous year. This would see the original projec-
tion of the federal government for 2016 be exceeded
by 0.2 percentage points. According to the ministry,
the German economy is ona solid growth course and
is reinforcing its potential in an extremely challeng-
ing climate, particularly in terms of foreign trade. In
the wake of significant growth of 0.7 % in the first
quarter of 2016, growth momentum slowed over the
course of the year to 0.2 % in the third quarter. How-
ever, economic growth picked up again in the final
quarter of 2016. The outlook for the global economic
climate and international trade became bleaker dur-
ing the year, particularly due to the Brexit referen-
dum and the slowdown in growth in the USA. In
Germany, however, the domestic market was in
robust shape.

The labour market developed dynamically, boasting
new record employment figures once again. Rising
incomes and only moderate rates of inflation stimu-
lated private consumption, which remained the key
pillar of growth. The increase in incomes and low
interest rates also benefited private investment in
residential property. Financial policy also had signif-
icant expansive effects on economic development.
This was due in part to additional spending to deal
with the influx of refugees, but there was also a major
increase in public-sector investment.

Investments in equipment, on the other hand, were
limited by weak exports and uncertainties surround-
ing the foreign trade environment. Asa result, robust
domestic demand stood against negative growth
from foreign trade. There was slight recovery in eco-
nomic development in the second half of 2016. Asa
result, there was alsoa significant upturn in the busi-
ness climate. Further growth is expected in 2017.

Annual Report 2016

The Swiss economy continued its recovery in 2016.
Following relatively weak GDP growth of 0.8 % in
2015, which was impacted by the currency appre-
ciation, growth is expected to have come in at 1.5%
in 2016. However, the fall in the growth dynamic
was also evident in Switzerland in 2016, with Swiss
GDP stagnating in the third quarter after four pos-
itive quarters in succession. That being said, early
indicators suggest that growth has picked up once
again. Global economic development is expected to
continue to provide positive impetus.

Economic recovery accelerated in Austria once
again in 2016. In the wake of GDP growth of 1.0%
in the prior year, expansion is expected to stand at
between 1.4% and 1.5% in 2016. Private spending,
bolstered by tax reductions, is one of the main pil-
lars of growth here.

billion in 2016. Asa result, the growth dynamic has
slowed considerably compared to the previous year’s
figure of 4.2 %. This was largely due to the signifi-
cant fall in growth in the IT hardware sector to 2.8 %.

However, the IT market grew at almost twice the rate
of the economy as a whole. After a solid increase in
the previous year, growth in the software segment
was somewhat lower in 2016 at +6.2 % and reached
a market volume of EUR 24.3 billion.

Growth in the IT services industry, which is the
most important for adesso Group in terms of sales,
rose slightly year on year by 0.1 percentage point to
2.7 %. According to BITKOM, this was largely due to
digitalisation among companies. The market volume
of this segment now amounts to EUR 38.2 billion.

Industry-specific conditions therefore continued to
be positive for adesso’s business performance.

Business Performance

There were no individual events that could be seen
as having significantly affected the business perfor-
mance in the reporting period. The acquisition of
what is now known as smarthouse adesso financial
solutions GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany, in the sec-
ond quarter of 2016 has to be taken into account in
assessing the development of key performance fig-
ures such as sales, the number of employees, oper-
ating earnings and depreciation and amortisation.

Overall Statement on Business Performance by
the Management

adesso Group was able to improve sales by 33 %
(of which 19 % is organic) and operating earnings
(EBITDA) by 61 % year on year, achieving its 2016
targets for these key performance figures. The objec-
tive of generating a minimum EBITDAmargin of
6.5 % was also achieved, with the final margin com-
ing in at 8.9 % and resulting in a margin increase of
1.6 percentage points.

Internationalisation targets were not able to be
achieved in full. The development of adesso’s own
product family for the insurance sector remains pos-
itive. Pre-tax earnings (EBT) increased by 76 % to
EUR 16.7 million.

Earnings Situation

Growth in Sales

adesso Group successfully increased its sales by 33 %
from EUR 196.4 million to EUR 260.4 million in
financial year 2016. By expanding the existing busi-
ness activities and growing the service and product
portfolio, purely organic growth was 19 %, exclud-
ing the company acquisitions in 2016.

With estimated market growth of 3.0 % for the
industry, adesso, as it did in previous years, had sig-
nificantly higher organic growth than the market in
2016 and was, therefore, able to gain additional mar-
ket share.

During the financial year 2016, sales revenues
increased from EUR 119.0 million in the first six
months to a new high of EUR 141.4 million in the
second half of the year. The increase is due to the
higher number of potential working days, a further
increase in the number of employees, higher licens-
ing proceeds and increased sales contributions from
company acquisitions.

In the IT Services segment, the adesso Group’s lead-
ing subsidiary by size in Germany, adesso AG, was
able to increase its sales significantly by 29 % as in

the previous year due to the high proportion of
externally purchased services. In Switzerland, sales
including subsequent M&A effects rose by 24 %,
while in Turkey sales were up by 14 %. In Austria,
no organic growth was generated.

Most of the sales with external experts are gener-
ated in the context of adesso Group projects. Exter-
nal resources are used here for capacity reasons or
to obtain specialised knowledge. The share of sales
generated with external experts rose in 2016. Sales
revenues generated in the area of “Expert Resourc-
ing” rose by 34 % year on year to EUR 13.6 million.
An additional contribution to sales growth in the IT
Services segment was made by the business activ-
ities with Smart Hosting & Cloud Services with
a growth rate of 40 %. Further significant growth
contributions came from the E-Commerce busi-

ness area.

In the IT Solutions segment, the Content Solutions
business area was able to increase the licensing and
maintenance sales for the in-house content manage-
ment system FirstSpirit by 3 %. Due to the increased
share of contractual models with diverse sales real-
isation, such as in the case of software as a service

agreement, there is a delay between rising order
intake and rising sales revenues from licences. This
applies particularly in the USA, where new custom-
ers were once again acquired.

Sales in the Mobile Solutions segment rose signif-
icantly. Mobilising web content and business pro-
cesses is one of the fastest-growing areas in IT. In this
field, adesso Group is a leading company for enter-
prise mobility in Germany. Its own in|JMOTION
technology, along with proven expertise in the
development of mobile applications and integra-
tion with knowledge about core business processes
among adesso customers, make a contribution here.
Continuing to expand the business with in|sure,
adesso’s own family of products for the insurance
sector, is an important growth driver in the IT Solu-
tions segment. Sales revenues from licences and from
implementation projects both rose, with sales able
to be increased with many of adesso Group’s top ten
customers.

Percentage sales growth was highest in the core bank-
ing/financial services and lottery industries. Dou-
ble-digit growth rates were consistently achieved in
banking/financial services, insurance and healthcare

as the core industries that account for the largest pro-
portion ofadesso’s sales. The automotive and trans-
portation industry, established as a new core indus-
try in 2016, was able to attract new customers and
increase sales.

Sales with customers outside of Germany increased
by 5 % in 2016 to EUR 46.0 million.

Earnings

Operating earnings (EBITDA) increased by 61 % in
2016, while the EBITDA margin improved from
7.3 % to 8.9 %. The targets were therefore exceeded.
The most important factors in the significant
increase in earnings were the organic sales growth
of 19 % and the earnings contributions from com-
pany acquisitions in 2015 and 2016.

A higher gross margin (sales revenues less cost of
materials) per employee was also realised through
improved daily rates, especially in the course of
implementation projects for the own insurance
solutions, and through high capacity utilisation. The
contribution margin from maintenance and licens-
ing proceeds with a significant impact on earnings
increased, as well.

SERVICE

At sales growth of 33 %, the average number of
employees (FTEs) grew by 28 %, or 422 employ-
ees, to 1,956 in 2016. With a lower material usage
ratio of 10.8 % (previous year: 11.7 %), gross profit
per employee increased significantly by 5 % to
EUR 119 thousand (previous year: EUR 113 thou-
sand). At EUR 3.3 million, other operating income
rose by EUR 1.4 million year on year. This increase
was due to a rise in revenues from the reversal of
provisions.

The cost of materials came in at EUR 28.1 million
(previous year: EUR 23.0 million) and was mainly
associated with the cost of integrating subcontrac-
tors into projects, which rose by 22 % and therefore
by a less-significant margin than sales. This means
that gross profit increased by a greater margin than
sales, namely by 34 % to EUR 232.3 million (previ-
ous year: EUR 173.6 million).

Personnel costs were up by 34 % to EUR 168.3 mil-
lion. This included higher variable compensation
due to earnings growth throughout the Group and
a EUR 4.0 million (prior year: EUR 1.3 million)
increase in the valuation of long-term incentives, as
the price of the adesso share increased significantly in

average personnel costs per employee from EUR 82
thousand to EUR 86 thousand.

Other operating expenses increased by a dispro-
portionately low margin compared to sales reve-
nues by 23 % to EUR 44.3 million (previous year:
EUR 36.1 million). A large share of this increase was
due to the rise in the number of employees. Costs
such as travel, vehicle and training expenses tend
to increase proportionately with each employee.
Occupancy and related costs also increased due to
relocations and expansions. However, the increase
in other operating expenses was lower than the
increase in sales, which had a positive impact on

ciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by

The operating EBITDA margin came to 8.9 %, up
from 7.3 % in the previous year. This rise in the

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Economic Report

EBITDA of EUR 8.9 million (previous year: EUR 4.2
million) was generated in the first half of the year and
rose to EUR 14.2 million in the second half (previ-
ous year: EUR 10.1 million). The increase during the
year was largely due to the higher number of poten-
tial working days, company acquisitions and higher
license sales.

Both segments contributed to the increase in earn-
ings. In the IT Services segment, the subsidiaries in
Germany and Switzerland and e-commerce business
made a particular contribution to the rise in earn-
ings, whereas earnings declined in Austria and Tur-
key. In the IT Solutions segment, additional earn-
ings contributions from the sale and introduction of
in|sure, adesso’s own insurance solutions, and the
rise in income from licences and maintenance with
FirstSpirit had a positive effect.

Depreciation and amortisation increased by 30 % in
the reporting period to EUR 6.4 million. This signifi-
cant increase was due both to organic growth and to
the amortisation ofintangible assets from the acqui-
sition of what is now smarthouse adesso financial
solutions GmbH and of flitcon GmbH. This includes
amortisation resulting from business combinations
of EUR 2.3 million (previous year: EUR 2.1 million).
It also includes depreciation on property, plant and
equipment and amortisation of intangible assets,
which increased significantly by EUR 1.2 million to
EUR 4.0 million. Besides the growth of the company
during 2016 and in the previous year, the further
expansion of the licensing base for internal software
tools due to amendments to partnership contracts
was the driving force behind the increase in depre-
ciation and amortisation. As in the previous year, no
goodwill impairments were recognised.

Income from financing and investment activities
remained at approximately EUR 0.0 million. Interest
expense increased significantly by 53 % to EUR 0.4
million due to revolving money market loans granted
for acquisitions in the amount of EUR 24.0 million
and EUR 6.5 million respectively. This was offset
by the year-on-year rise in income from investment
activities from EUR 0.3 million to EUR 0.4 million.

Earnings before taxes (EBT) were up by 76 % to
EUR 16.7 million (previous year: EUR 9.5 million)
due to the significant rise in operating earnings.
Income tax expense stood at EUR 4.0 million (previ-

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SERVICE

ous year: EUR 4.2 million) and the effective tax rate
came in at 24 % (previous year: 44 %). The utilisa-
tion of tax loss carry-forwards, on which no deferred
tax assets had been formed in previous years, hada
positive effect on the tax result. Overall, the afore-
mentioned effects led to positive consolidated earn-
ings of EUR 12.7 million in 2016, up from EUR 5.3
million in the previous year. The proportion of con-
solidated earnings allocated to minority interests
amounted to EUR 0.2 million, down from EUR 0.6
million in the previous year, so that the portion allo-
cated to adesso shareholders rose by EUR 7.8 mil-
lion to EUR 12.5 million. Earnings per share stood
at EUR 2.14, increasing from EUR 0.82 in the pre-
vious year.

Orders

Order intake increased throughout 2016 due to
high demand. A general slump in demand was not
observed in any region, segment or industry. Busi-
ness activities continued at the start of 2017 with
the vast majority of the leading customers for 2016.

Financial Position

Financial Management Principles and Objectives
adesso pursues a balanced financial policy. The objec-
tive of financial management is to assure short-term
liquidity, including a margin of safety, as well as to

adesso Group

Annual Report 2016

secure and acquire financial assets to fund medium-
and long-term investment projects. In principle,
the company does not enter into investment trans-
actions with speculative elements.

There are no variable interest rates on investments.
The maximum investment term is six months, with
investments on a daily basis being the most com-
mon in view of interest rates tending towards zero
for low-risk investments in order to remain flexible
in response to investment opportunities that arise.

Central cash management at the level of daily
account clearing has not been set up. Bank borrowing
is centralised with the parent company. The account
balances and financial position of all companies are
transparent to the Group’s Executive Board, and con-
stitute a standard element of the monthly reporting
system. All interest-bearing liabilities are denomi-
nated in euros, except for the 2015 acquisition in
Switzerland denominated in Swiss francs. Factoring
or other methods of selling receivables are not used.

Capital Structure

Financing is needed primarily for the receivables
portfolio and services that have not been settled in
the amount of EUR 70.0 million (previous year:
EUR 46.7 million). Working capital (trade receiv-
ables plus PoC receivables less trade payables and
PoC liabilities) came to EUR 47.0 million as at 31
December 2016 (previous year: EUR 30.4 million).
Asa result, the need for advance financing of busi-
ness operations rose by 55 % year on year, while sales
increased by 33 %. Acquired companies not included
in the consolidated financial statements for the full
year are to be taken into consideration here.

In 2016, the Group took out loans totalling EUR 24.0
million (on instalment payments) to acquire shares
in what is now smarthouse adesso financial solutions
GmbH and increase the shareholding in ARITHNEA
GmbH to 100 %. The loans have been granted for
terms of five years at a fixed rate of interest of 1.0%
p.a. Newly taken out revolving money market loans
with terms of between three and six months and
interest rates of between 0.2 % and 0.3 % p.a. con-
tinued to exist as at the reporting date. The portfo-
lio of interest-bearing financial liabilities increased
as a result and following instalment payments from
EUR 25.6 million in the previous year to EUR 47.0
million on the reporting date. Interest is fixed over

the respective entire term. All interest-bearing lia-
bilities are denominated in euros or Swiss francs.
Credit balances are available in the short term and
bear fixed rates of interest. Net liquidity after deduct-
ing the financial liabilities is EUR -4.2 million (pre-
vious year: EUR 6.4 million).

Investments, Acquisitions and Divestments

The adesso business model requires relatively low
investments in property, plant and equipment. The
capital assets of EUR 6.7 million (previous year:
EUR 5.3 million) largely consist of hardware, such
as laptops and servers, as well as office furnish-
ings. Investments in more employees, as well as the
expansion of licenses for software programs used
internally are responsible for the increase. There are
no significant subsequent obligations from prop-
erty, plant and equipment investment projects as at
31 December 2016, and no investment backlog to
report.

In the reporting period, adesso AG acquired all
shares in what is now smarthouse financial solu-
tions GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany, at a cost of
EUR 23.6 million. This company has established an
excellent position in the financial services indus-
try in the provision and maintenance of efficient
and high-tech financial information websites. This
expands adesso Group’s access to financial institu-
tions’ specialist departments and widens its portfo-
lio in this sector.

The increase in the stake in ARITHNEA GmbH from
51% to 100 %, which was contractually agreed in
2015, was successfully implemented in 2016 partly
through a non-cash capital increase. Purchase agree-
ments concerning the full acquisition of SP Integra-
tion GmbH and flitcon GmbH were concluded in
September 2016.

SP Integration GmbH is expanding its capacities
and Microsoft customer portfolio, particularly in
the metropolitan area of Frankfurt am Main. The
company employs 30 people; the purchase price
amounts to up to EUR 0.4 million, EUR 0.3 million
fixed, with anticipated EBIT of EUR 0.1 million.

flitcon GmbH isa consulting firm with 15 employees
specialising in business intelligence in the insurance
industry. The purchase price amounted to EUR 2.2
million with anticipated EBIT of EUR 0.4 million.

Annual Report 2016

Both companies were merged with adesso AG with
retroactive economic effect in 2016. Last but not
least, the stake in PSLife Consulting GmbH was
increased from 70 % to 100 % ata cost of EUR 1.4
million. The notes to the consolidated financial state-
ments provide more details on this.

Liquidity

Cash and cash equivalents totalled EUR 43.1 mil-
lion on the reporting date (previous year: EUR 28.2
million). They were partly offset by financial liabili-
ties, mainly from acquisition loans, in the amount of
EUR 47.4 million (previous year: EUR 21.7 million).
Net liquidity after the deduction of interest-bearing
liabilities decreased by EUR 10.6 million to EUR -4.2
million (previous year: EUR 6.4 million).

Cash flow from operating activities stood at
EUR 15.5 million (previous year: EUR 16.9 mil-
lion). The considerable growth in net operating
assets of EUR 7.1 million prevented any further
increase, despite the sharp rise in EBITDA. Cash
flow from investment activities stood at EUR -30.2
million (previous year: EUR -26.9 million). This
amount was the result of company acquisitions as
well as payments for non-current assets, which
increased from EUR 2.1 million to EUR 2.3 million
year on year. Cash flow from financing activities
amounted to EUR 29.7 million, up from EUR 14.1
million in the previous year. This was the result of
taking out EUR 30.5 million of new acquisition and
money market loans and the addition of EUR 12.7
million from a cash capital increase.

Dividends of EUR 2.3 million (previous year:
EUR 2.1 million) were paid out, of which EUR 1.7
million went to adesso AG’s shareholders (pre-
vious year: EUR 1.4 million). All in all, cash and
cash equivalents rose by EUR 15.0 million com-
pared to an increase of EUR 4.4 million in the pre-
vious year.

Variable salary components are paid from cash and
cash equivalents and are paid out in the first few
months of 2017. This is typical for the business.
Overall, the liquidity of the adesso Group is ade-
quate to carry on current business operations, for the
planned redemption of liabilities and to compensate
for ordinary fluctuations in capacity utilisation.

Results of Operations

Analysis of the Asset Structure

Total assets on the reporting date increased year on
year by 53 %, or EUR 63.3 million, to EUR 183.5
million. The acquisitions and the capital increase
were the main driving forces behind this devel-
opment, besides the organic growth of business
activities.

On the assets side, goodwill increased by EUR 17.6
million as a result of the acquisition. Other intan-
gible assets increased by EUR 5.3 million. Sales
growth and the acquisition caused trade receivables
to increase by EUR 17.3 million and PoC receivables
by EUR 6.0 million.

In absolute terms, current assets increased more
sharply than non-current assets. On the liabilities
side, non-current liabilities, and in particular liabil-
ities to banks, increased by EUR 20.9 million. Con-
solidated equity increased by EUR 17.3 million to
EUR 59.7 million due to the capital increase at the
parent company and the positive consolidated earn-
ings. The sharp rise in total assets resulted in the con-
solidated equity ratio fall from 35.3 % to 32.6 %.

Financial and Non-financial Performance Indicators
The key financial performance indicators used
for internal control of the Group are sales growth,
EBITDA and the EBITDA margin. Targets and actual
values for the reporting period as well as the medium
and long-term target corridor are provided in the fol-
lowing table.

adesso Group does not use any group-wide non-
financial performance indicators for the internal
control of the group. Given the outstanding impor-
tance to the group of adesso AG, which is responsi-
ble for over 50 % of adesso Group business, and the
otherwise broad range of control-relevant perfor-
mance indicators within the group due to the busi-
ness it conducts, the financial and non-financial per-
formance indicators used for the internal control of
adesso AG are reported on below.

The development of earnings generated by adesso
AG depends ona number of performance indicators.
In addition to the growth rate which is achieved,
these are in particular:

Annual Report 2016

Employee capacity utilisation (proportion of
employees working on customer projects)

The proportion of employees working on billable
customer projects has a direct influence on earnings.
The greatest possible constant and high utilisation
is the goal, without severely limiting flexibility in
staffing new projects. Since the end and beginning
of projects cannot always be optimally scheduled
in sequence, some basic non-utilisation of capac-
ity is unavoidable. Utilisation is measured biweekly
according to the number of employees in operations
and is reported as the proportion of employees that
are not assigned to a project.

A higher utilisation was achieved in 2016 compared
to the previous year. The achieved value is within
the target corridor and above the two previous years.

Booking Intensity

(Average of Billed Hours per Project Day)

The number of billable customer hours as the basis
for sales and earnings is subject to fluctuations,
which do not depend on the order situation, such
as the number of potential working days, holidays
taken, illness and capacity utilisation. When these
effects are neutralised in the analysis of billable cus-
tomer hours, it is possible to determine the aver-
age billable customer hours per project day for an
employee assigned to a project, provided that struc-
tures remain unchanged. Changes to structures, such
as the management team, career levels and working
models, are also included in booking intensity. The
booking intensity determined this way measures
the development of quantitative value creation per
employee in the project and structural efficiency.

Since additional or fewer hours worked per pro-
ject day leave costs virtually unchanged, a change in
the booking intensity has a direct impact on earn-
ings. The booking intensity is also influenced by the
intensity of pursuing internal projects for company
development, business development or pre-sales. It
is specified as a percentage of an eight-hour workday.

Average booking intensity fell again slightly in 2016
compared to the previous year and stood below the
target range. This was due to the introduction ofa
trainee model, in which trainees are introduced to
the company and project work through a mixture of
training and project involvement that is either free
for the customer or at a very low cost. This model has

been a resounding success from a recruiting perspec-
tive as well as for projects and trainees themselves
and, thanks to the high number of trainees (over 50),
has had a significantly positive impact on booking
intensity, as trainees perform much fewer billable
customer hours.

Average Daily Rates

The change in the average daily rates, both in pro-
jects billed on a time and materials basis and in fixed-
price projects ona calculation basis, is a key earnings
driver. In particular compared to the change in labour
cost per employee as the leading cost item, it has a
significant impact on the operating earnings mar-
gin. Accordingly, the daily rates are a fixed internal
control element. Their developmentis tracked on an
individual customer basis and they are purposefully
examined for improvement potential. The change
in the average daily rate is reported as a percentage
compared to the previous period. In financial year
2016, the daily rate — billed on a time and materials
basis — was once again successfully increased within
the target range.

Calculated Daily Rates and Budget
Overruns for Fixed-price Projects

The number of project days in fixed-price projects
that exceed the budget has a direct impact on earn-
ings, since those days are not available for other
potential working time. Even if they can only be
used in combination with projects completed below
budget for an overall image of the impact that fixed-
price projects have on earnings, the change in budget
overruns serves as a signal for progress or setbacks
related to fixed-price projects. The evaluation is
based on days and not on euros, so this is a qualita-
tive view.

Together with the daily rates used in project cal-
culations, the under- and over-budget ratio is used
to derive the calculated daily rate on fixed-projects
during post-calculation. In 2016, adesso Group was
able to avoid devaluation-induced budget shortfalls
and significantly increase the calculated daily rate on
fixed-projects. The target corridor was met.

adesso AG examines employee aspects as non-finan-
cial performance indicators. As a fast-growing pre-
mium IT service provider, adesso depends on the
ability to gain many of the best graduates and expe-
rienced experts as new employees to pursue their

internal further development as extensively as pos-
sible and to retain them over the long term. Here the
following two performance indicators are of partic-
ular relevance.

Recruiting Performance Figures and Turnover
Recruiting examines the number of applications
received, initial interviews conducted and new hires.
The turnover ratio is based on employee resignations
of permanent staff.

In 2016, the number of applications received and
initial interviews were increased by 26 % and 20 %
respectively and at a higher rate of year-on-year
growth than gross profit. The rapid organic growth
continued, with the number of new hires for all posi-
tions increasing by 30 %. This was due to the expan-
sion of the trainee programmes, further efforts to
integrate students early on and the receipt of more-
targeted applications. The turnover ratio decreased
and remains at a good level within the target corridor.

Group management also examines the develop-
ment of licence and maintenance proceeds from the
FirstSpirit product and from the in|sure product for
insurance companies as internal performance indica-
tors, since licence proceeds in a short-term quarterly
and financial year view have a major direct impact on
earnings, and because maintenance proceeds form
the basis for growing the development and mar-
keting cost base of the product. Licence and main-
tenance proceeds were increased within the target
corridor in 2016.

Group Orientation over the Coming Financial Year
adesso’s vision of becoming one of Central Europe’s
leading IT consulting firms for industry-specific
business processes will be pursued with vigour. The
strategic guidelines for profitable growth through
industry segmentation, new industries, new tech-
nologies, regional expansion and the expansion of
the company’s solution portfolio will continue to
determine what action adesso takes over the next
two years.

adesso Group will continue to invest in its own prod-
ucts and solutions, such FirstSpirit, inJMOTION in
the Enterprise Mobility segment, and in|sure and
drebis for the insurance sector. It will continue to
pursue its active acquisition policy and also priori-
tise the rapid expansion of business activities while
accepting that margins may be negatively impacted
asa result.

Future Macroeconomic Situation

In the wake of the significant upturn in economic
development in Germany in 2014, growth momen-
tum only rose slightly in 2015 by 0.1 percent-
age points to 1.7 %. The federal government had
expected the rate of growth to remain stable in the
reporting year, but economic growth continued to
accelerate by a low margin to 1.9 % of gross domes-
tic product.

In its latest projection issued in autumn 2016, the
federal government expects there to be a major
decrease in GDP growth momentum to 1.4 % in
2017. However, the government puts this decline
down to the lower number of working days rather
than any kind of economic downturn. Adjusted
for calendar effects, growth in 2017 and 2018 is
forecast to be much steadier at 1.6 %. The federal
government expects continued solid growth for
Germany even though the global economic envi-
ronment is mixed.
COMPANY

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Forecast, Opportunities and

Based on forecasts from international organisa-
tions, the global economy is expected to expand
from 3.25 % in 2017 to 3.75 % in 2018. Prospects
for individual regions, however, are extremely var-
ied. The situation in emerging economies is said to
have stabilised, while the outcome of the Brexit ref-
erendum has significantly reduced growth prospects
for the United Kingdom, particularly in the coming
year. The eurozone is set to continue its moderate
growth, even though growth forecasts for 2017 are
somewhat bleaker due to Brexit effects. All in all,
weak growth on Germany’s most important sales
markets means that export growth is only set to be
moderate.

Although the outlooks for foreign trade and the
global economy have been somewhat brighter since
the end of 2016, development continues to be
fuelled by solid domestic economies. Private con-
sumption, bolstered by further rises in employment
rates and significant real income increases, is set to
inject significant momentum into economic devel-
opment in the coming years.

Based on information provided by a federal expert
group, SECO, the Swiss State Secretariat for Eco-
nomic Affairs, expects the Swiss economy to expe-
rience subdued growth in the coming years follow-
ing widespread recovery in 2016 to GDP growth
of 1.5 %. It anticipates growth of 1.8 % and 1.9% in
2017 and 2018 respectively, which will be driven by
domestic demand and foreign trade.

Based on projections by the Austrian Institute of
Economic Research (WIFO) and the Austrian Insti-
tute for Advanced Studies (IHS), the Austrian Fed-
eral Ministry of Science, Research and Economy
expects GDP growth to remain stable at between
1.4% and 1.5 % in 2017. The IHS expects the rate
of growth to increase slightly to 1.5 % in 2018,
whereas the WIFO anticipates a slight slowdown
in growth to 1.4 % due to the planned end to tax
breaks midway through 2017 and the impact on
consumer demand.

Asa result, adesso expects a largely friendly mac-
roeconomic market environment in 2017, associ-
ated with ongoing and some new risks in regards to
actual development. One key tenet of the German
federal government’s projection is that Brexit and
other effects will not lead to any negative develop-

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SERVICE

ments that will result in uncertainty rising signifi-
cantly in the projection period. In addition, itis also
assumed that the financial sector will remain stable
and that there will be no further escalation in geo-
political risks. Based on previous measures and ten-
dencies towards stabilisation of the financial sector
and the eurozone, a serious worsening of the cur-
rent positive economic development in the sectors
important for adesso is not expected in 2017 and
2018.

Future Industry Situation

According to the assessment of the industry associa-
tion BITKOM, the ITC market will continue to grow
in 2017. BITKOM expects the overall ITC market
to expand by 1.2 % to EUR 162.4 billion in 2017.
Growth in the previous year stood at 1.7 %. Besides
the slight slowdown in macroeconomic growth, the
lower rate of growth is due to the anticipated weak-
ening of business involving IT hardware such as
desktop PCs and notebooks and a more-significant
decline in sales involving landline and mobile phone
services owing to price competition and regulatory
effects.

According to research institute Gartner, global IT
investment is expected to rise by 2.7 % to USD 3.5
trillion in 2017. The highest rates of growth are
expected to be generated by the Enterprise Soft-
ware segment, with growth of 6.8 % (2016: 5.9 %) to
USD 355 billion, and the IT services segment, with
growth of 4.2 % (2016: 3.9 %) to USD 938 billion.
Both segments are also expected to experience accel-
erated growth rates in 2018.

Internally, adesso Group assumes the market growth
relevant to adesso in 2017 will be up by 3.0% in the
DACH region.

Anticipated Sales and Earnings Situation

The report on risks and opportunities is a pivotal part
of management’s considerations of the further devel-
opment of adesso and of the forecast report. Potential
acquisitions or acquisitions targeted after the point at
which the consolidated management report is pre-
pared are not included in the forecast report.

Based on anticipated economic growth of 3.0 % in
relevant segments of the IT market as well as on
internal calculations, adesso’s management expects
the following developments in financial year 2017:

53
adesso Group

Annual Report 2016

> Sales revenues are expected to increase to between
EUR 270 million and EUR 300 million (2016:
EUR 196 million and 2015: EUR 157 million).

> Operating earnings (EBITDA) are expected to range
between EUR 23.0 million and EUR 27.0 million
(2016: EUR 23.1 million and 2015: EUR 14.3 mil-
lion).

> In terms of the operating EBITDA margin, a mini-
mum value of 7.5 % is being targeted (2016: mini-
mum value of 6.5 %).

Growth significantly above the industry average is
expected in both segments. It must be noted that, on
average, there are three fewer working days in 2017
compared to the previous year, which will result in
a lower earnings contribution per employee in the
IT Services segment and dampen potential earn-
ings growth. The organic expansion of the number
of employees in Germany in 2016 resulted in a cor-
responding rise in sales expectations for 2017.

The planned increase in the operating result was pre-
dominantly based on growth targets and earnings
contributions from company acquisitions. Earnings
are expected to be higher in the second half of 2017
than in the first half of the year. This is due to the
slightly higher number of working days in the sec-
ond half of the year, higher licence proceeds based
on empirical figures and assumed growth through-
out the year.

For 2018, we are anticipating further sales growth
as well as further positive development of the oper-
ating result.

Expected Financial Position

adesso Group’s liquid asset base is considered solid
and will be sufficient to cover financial obligations
in 2017 should the forecast business development
come to fruition. The consolidated balance sheet
structure at adesso Group and the balance sheet
structure at adesso AG allow them to assume addi-
tional liabilities for investment projects to ensure
that there are no shortfalls in terms of financing.

adesso Group is aiming to achieve net debt of
between zero and 1.5 times EBITDA in the past
financial year. Only if there is an opportunity to
acquire a company of unusual size and profitability
with a high strategic value for adesso Group would
a deviation be considered.

The Executive Board intends to continue the div-
idend policy on this basis, calling for a balanced
weighting of investments in growth, financial sta-
bility and shareholder participation in the compa-
ny’s earnings. If the earnings targets can largely be
achieved, the Executive Board will strive to further
increase the dividend. The dividend proposed for
2017 will reflect actual business development.

Forecast, Opportunities and
Risk Reports

Opportunities and Risk Report

Risk managementis a pivotal component ofall deci-
sions and business processes. adesso takes a broad
view of risk, defined as the risk of not achieving
financial and operating targets as planned and, in
the strictest sense, factors endangering the exist-
ence of the company. In order to safeguard the suc-
cess of the company over the long term, it is there-
fore essential that adesso identifies and analyses risks
efficiently and combats or mitigates them by imple-
menting sufficient control measures. adesso’s active
risk management therefore also opens up opportu-
nities for the company.

Risk Management System

adesso Group possesses a system of processes and
data analysis structures to monitor risks posed to
the Group. An exclusive risk management software
system is not used. Instead, adesso uses an inte-
grated system developed by Corporate Planning
AG for financial and operational planning as well
as operational controlling. All plan and actual data
from all business areas is stored in a central data-
base for the purposes of reporting. Current figures
are recorded directly from the company’s financial
accounting. Key performance indicators such as sales
per employee, available liquidity, resources not fully
utilised and incoming orders and the order backlog
are registered. All companies included in the scope of
consolidation are part of the reporting system.

Fixed reporting channels have been established for
other risks, such as those arising from the absence
of contracts, high levels of receivables from cus-
tomers or projects that are threatening to go over
budget. Certain reporting thresholds apply, which,
if breached, result in the issue being included on the
agenda of Executive Board meetings. Similar risks
posed to companies in the adesso Group are identi-
fied through close cooperation with the respective
responsible Executive Board member of adesso AG.
adesso does not have a central risk manager. Risk
reporting and assessment is documented in a risk
manual. The risk manual is submitted to the Super-
visory Board and to the auditor so that the risk man-
agement system can be acknowledged and reviewed.

Recognising opportunities and new areas of business
are just as important for the development of adesso
Group. Working groups consisting of the Executive

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SERVICE

Board, Business Development, the management of
companies in adesso Group and heads of business
areas, meet on a regular basis to analyse new busi-
ness opportunities and develop new business mod-
els, industries, solutions or regions. The progress
made in implementing these measures is presented
at regular intervals.

Within the scope of a risk inventory, the following
risks were assessed as relevant to the business and
subsequently assessed in view of their probability
of occurrence and amount of loss. In principal, only
risks that would have negative implications for the
asset, financial or profit situation are listed here.

Moreover, adesso Group is potentially exposed to
further risks which may not be known or be consid-
ered as major risks at the current time. The risk fac-
tor is calculated from the probability of occurrence
and the amount of loss, which determines how rel-
evant the risk is. The following risks were identified
as at the reporting date and as at the preparation of
the management report as having a risk factor wor-
thy of inclusion in this report:

Primary Risk Carrier

Project Risks

In the event of the budgeted time frame and costs
being exceeded, fixed-price projects can lead to
project-related losses. Budget deviations are iden-
tified and analysed constantly during every fixed-
price project. There is also an escalation mechanism
that extends to the Executive Board. A customer has
refused acceptance under a service contract as at the
reporting date (previous year: one refusal of accept-
ance). One customer claimed back payments total-
ling more EUR 0.1 million (previous year: no cus-
tomers). Several projects presented for customer
approval have not yet been formally accepted by the
customer. However, given that none of these cus-
tomers has refused approval, this delay is not unu-
sual in normal business practice.

The backlog of fixed-price projects that have yet to
be invoiced in full rose year on year. However, pro-
ject risk remains unchanged since the proportion of
budget overruns in fixed-priced projects was further
reduced.

A customer in Austria threatened damage claims of
EUR 1.3 million in 2013 for allegedly high subse-

55
56

adesso Group

Annual Report 2016

quent costs relating to the software supplied as part
of a project. Those claims have not been pursued
in court and adesso cannot see any grounds for the
claims. As in the past two years, there was no further
communication with the former customer regarding
the claim in 2016.

adesso Group uses an Excel-based project controlling
and reporting system, which directly draws on data
from the ERP system implemented in mid-2016 and
from the respective time and project management
systems.

Depending on the project structure, sub-projects
are defined and mapped on our web-based project
and schedule management system. Expenses are dis-
tributed across the sub-projects and milestones are
defined. Over the course of the project, actual time
and expenses are compared with planning figures,
the expenses are calculated and compliance with
the defined schedule is documented. Additional
monthly or weekly assessments of work still to be
completed are used to calculate the level of comple-
tion of the project underway.

By comparing the level of completion and the
remaining expenses, any potential budget devia-
tions can be identified at an early stage. Projects that
are likely to exceed the budget are given “overspend”
status and are then added to the agenda of subse-
quent Executive Board meetings.

Aside from acknowledging the risk, the Executive
Board meeting also discusses potential strategies to
improve the situation by analysing the reasons for
the overspending. In most cases, the estimations of
remaining costs are determined and cost develop-
ment displayed as a graph in order to counteract the
tendency that project inconsistencies are identified
too late. However, the share of projects with fixed
budgets in the form of service contracts in terms of
overall adesso Group sales is low at under 20 %.

adesso AG has established a Project Management
Office (PMO) where experts supervise particularly
large-scale or challenging projects using standard-
ised tools and mechanisms alongside the regular pro-
ject management team. These tools and processes
are routinely used. Expenses arising from budget
overspends for new fixed-price projects tended to
be lower compared to the average of previous years.

Risks from a Shortfall in Planned Sales

In the event of a high gross margin and a large pro-
portion of fixed costs, low sales can be directly
reflected in adesso’s results. Sales improved year on
year in 2016 and planned sales were exceeded, as in
the previous year. General expectations in terms of
economic development in 2017 are cautiously opti-
mistic, although uncertainty surrounds elections in
the USA, France and Germany. Demand, therefore,
appears to be dynamic at a level of certainty similar
to the previous planning period (the low growth rate
and the low oil price had a negative impact in the
previous year), albeit with a greater level of uncer-
tainty. The IT Services segment in 2017 is planning
for capacity utilisation to remain unchanged in 2017,
which, given political uncertainty, leads to a higher
planning risk. This risk factor is considered higher
compared to the previous year due to the higher like-
lihood of sales revenues not meeting planned figures.
However, a decline in order intake or the termination
of important ongoing customer orders could result in
idle periods with corresponding implications for the
profit and financial situation within a short period
of time. Given that the IT Services business area in
particular generates business over specific periods
of time, such idle periods are difficult to compen-
sate for. As this risk factor is highly relevant to the
company, adesso monitors the following values on
amonthly and sometimes biweekly basis in order to
identify trends at an early stage and take correspond-
ing action: Order backlog, order intake, number of
hours invoiced and capacity utilisation rates, number
of employees not working at full capacity. Planning
reliability for the subsidiary in Turkey that is under
development is considered unchanged.

The IT Solutions segment pursues a product strat-
egy. In this segment, even standard solutions devel-
oped by adesso are sold and implemented through
licensing with maintenance contracts. While the
established base of maintenance contracts repre-
sents a relatively stable basis for sales, the achieve-
ment of targets and the results of product companies
are reliant on order intake and much more volatile
than the service business, given the low number of
new licences sold. Sales revenues from maintenance
activities do not cover total ongoing costs at any of
the adesso Group companies. Asa result, the prod-
uct companies’ licence sales and related sales pipe-
lines are monitored in detail in terms of structure
and development over time. The planning deviation
COMPANY

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Forecast, Opportunities and
Risk Reports

risk factor remains constant in the IT Solutions seg-
ment for 2017 (previous year: stable after slight rise
in 2015 due to increased license sales in the USA for
the FirstSpirit product).

In each business area, there are detailed plans in
which actual figures and previous year’s figures are
compared ona monthly basis. A forecast is also pre-
pared and revised ona cycle, identifying possible
future deviations in a timely manner. Correspond-
ing reports form the basis for the monthly discus-
sions of business development and prospects. This
applies to all companies of adesso Group.

Financial Risks

The risks posed by the financial situation and
liquidity have increased slightly (previous year:
slight increase). Due to borrowing of approximately
EUR 20 million in further loans as part of acompany
acquisition, the indebtedness of adesso Group rose
despite the successful implementation of a capital
increase at the parent company with cash inflows of
over EUR 12 million.

These loans, and acquisition loans taken out in previ-
ous years, must be repaid regardless of the economic
performance of the company. As at 31 December
2016, the loan liabilities exceeded the level of cash
and cash equivalents (previous year: cash and cash
equivalents exceeded loan liabilities). Currency risks
remain low for us. Only a small proportion of sales
are conducted in a currency other than the euro.
These transactions mainly concern adesso Schweiz
AG and e-Spirit Schweiz AG, which conduct busi-
ness in Swiss francs, adesso Turkey, which operates
in Turkish lira, e-Spirit UK Ltd., which conducts
business in British pounds and e-Sprit Inc., which
operates in US dollars. These companies process the
majority of their business in the respective national
currency. No currency hedging transactions were
carried out.

As part of the review into the allocation of costs of
the market launch and entry of the FirstSpirit con-
tent management system in the USA, it was deter-
mined within the scope of an arm’s length com-
parison that — unlike previous practices — adesso
Group company e-Spirit AG must bear significant
shares of the losses which were incurred and con-
tinue to be incurred by the US subsidiary e-Spirit
Inc. (categorised as a limited-risk distributor).

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SERVICE

All losses incurred in the USA have so far been
fully financed by loans granted to e-Spirit Inc. by
e-Spirit AG. For the years 2011 to 2016, the mar-
ket entry compensation invoiced to e-Spirit AG by
e-Spirit Inc. amounted to EUR 5.1 million, includ-
ing the reversal of impairments in previous years.
This results in a reduction of the overall tax bur-
den of adesso AG (as the parent company of the
income tax group, including with e-Spirit AG) and
of adesso Group, as losses in the USA were not pre-
viously recognised as deferred tax assets. In the
case of incomplete or only partial recognition, the
effective tax rate of adesso AG and adesso Group in
2016 would be too low.

Financial risks can arise from the payment terms of
service agreements for completed projects with sig-
nificant volumes. In addition to prepayments and
instalments, payments are often linked to the com-
pletion of the project. In the case of delayed com-
pletion, significant liquidity shortfalls can arise. The
resulting risks can be predicted in the scope of pro-
ject controlling, but not prevented. In some cases,
project completion bonds must be deposited and are
paid out if a project fails. In the case of major pro-
jects, service agreements can lead to large receiva-
bles. For example, if a customer has not paid two
monthly invoices and the third month of service is
already being provided.

The level of unpaid receivables and their development
are included in monthly reporting at the individual
company level. The CFO includes major receivables
on the part of adesso AG in the agenda of Executive
Board meetings, where individual strategies for col-
lection are determined. There are currently several
major projects (previous year: several) that could
havea significant negative effect on adesso’s liquidity.
Projects relating to adesso solutions for the insurance
industry, in particular, involve flows of liquidity that
are largely independent of the provision of services.
The corresponding risk factor was already increased
in previous periods and remains at that level.

There were no notable risks from financial instru-
ments.

Personnel Risks

adesso Group is an IT company, and its most impor-
tant assets are its employees. Asa result, adesso con-
stantly monitors and assesses a number of key per-

57

formance indicators such as headcount, number of
unproductive employees, number of employees on
sick leave, employee, costs/sales per employee and
capacity utilisation.

The top-level management is always informed about
every dismissal and new recruit. The Executive Board
regularly analyses trends and discussed measures in
its meetings. This allows any potential loss of knowl-
edge and expertise to be identified promptly. In the
product segments, essential knowledge is concen-
trated around a small group of key developers. These
developers area particular focus of human resources
activities.

The search for suitable, experienced employees
remains characterised by a demand surplus from
companies. Circumstances remain difficult with
no change compared to the previous year (previous
year: no change, difficult). As in the past, the result-
ing entry-level salary expectations expressed by new
recruits, as well as existing employees’ expectations
regarding pay rises, cannot always be compensated
through a corresponding adjustment of market
prices, meaning that the operating margin can be
negatively impacted as a result.

We reinforce our position as a premium IT service
provider through extraordinarily talented employ-
ees with a vast amount of experience in their fields.
Competitors in this area continue to increase their
headcounts — not simply IT service providers, but
also between user companies and the IT industry. A
small number of employees are responsible for ades-
so’s outstanding position in its core industries. The
simultaneous departure of more than one of these
employees would expose the company to medium-
term risks in terms ofits further development. Such
risks are combated through active recruiting, strat-
egies to intensify employee loyalty and excellent
career prospects in a prospering company. The num-
bers of incoming applications and new hires were
further increased in 2016 over the already high level
in the previous year.

Employee turnover decreased further year on year in
2016 (previous year: decreased) and remains under
the industry average. The risk of insufficient avail-
ability of experienced employees for adesso is still
considered high (previous year: high). The risk from
high employee turnover and salaries increasing dis-

proportionately to market prices was assessed as
constant. Personnel risk remains one of the Group’s
highly weighted main risks.

Internationalisation/Risks from Business Activities
in other Legal Systems

adesso Group has expanded internationally in past
years, entering new legal systems. This involves
possible risks related to lacking knowledge of legal
affairs and business practices, as well as difficulties
with direct supervision by adesso AG’s Executive
Board due to distance.

In 2012, e-Spirit AG established the business oper-
ations of a company in the USA, e-Spirit Inc. based
in Boston, and continuously expanded its struc-
tures and customer base. In the USA, the risk of
product manufacturers taking legal action is greater
than it is in Germany. e-Spirit Inc. has an insurance
policy with the maximum amount of liability that
it could be granted. In terms of both the legal struc-
ture of the company as well as internal cost alloca-
tion, it has been ensured that the potential for any
problems to spread across to e-Spirit AG is as low
as possible.

In 2013 the company established adesso Turkey in
Istanbul and has begun operations there. The com-
pany did not turn a profit in 2016. The risk asso-
ciated with Turkey appears to remain high due to
political uncertainties, the Kurdish conflict and
the proximity to Syria. Given the size of the pre-
vious negative impact to earnings in the USA and
in Turkey, this risk is still considered to be a pri-
mary risk.

Risk Reports

Other Relevant Risks

Risks from the Customer Structure

As sales from individual customers or customer
groups increase, so does the risk posed by such cus-
tomer relationships from potential project termina-
tions or normal project expiry. The largest customer
accounted for 7 % (half year; previous year total: 8 %)
of total sales in 2016. Thirty eight percent of total
sales were generated with the ten largest custom-
ers (half year; previous year total: 38 %, 2014 total:
40%). Customer structure risks tend to decrease with
the growth ofadesso and the proportion of sales with
the top ten customers is constant. Continued cooper-
ation with the largest customers was agreed for 2017.

The risk is considered to be unchanged year on year
(previous year: unchanged) and remains in the group
of other relevant risks. However, the abrupt loss of
one of the top three customers or more than one of
the ten largest customers would have the potential
to negatively impact the earnings and financial situ-
ation of the Group substantially, at least in the short
term. The relationship to each of these top custom-
ers is managed by a member of the Executive Board
or by the management of the respective subsidiary in
order to recognise potential risks promptly and take
appropriate action.

The top ten customers are regularly listed by sales,
with each customer’s share of overall sales also
being calculated. This avoids concentration on a
small number of customer relationships and there-
fore allows a cluster risk to be recognised promptly.

Declining or Insufficiently Increasing Daily Rates

A significant proportion of sales is generated by service
agreements and the charging of hours or days of ser-
vice provided to the customer. With rising salaries and
prices providing the basis for other costs, increases in
nominal hourly and daily rates are essential in order to
maintain the earnings margin and ultimately the exist-
ence of the Group. However, one must differentiate
between a change in the daily rate for a certain activ-
ity for a certain customer and a change in average daily
rates resulting from a different combination of orders
or changes in the customer structure.

At adesso AG, volumes and daily rates are recorded
for all service agreements and analysed in terms of
their development. The volume-weighted aver-
age daily rate of the contract is thus calculated ona

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SERVICE

monthly, quarterly and annual basis and reflected in
the historical development. This does not include
orders based on framework agreements or public
tenders, which implies that the figures are suitable
for general statements only. The daily rate for the
orders increased by 2 % in 2016 compared to 2015
(previous year: 2 %), so that the risk of realised aver-
age daily rates is considered unchanged in the con-
text of low overall increases in costs.

The realised daily rates are also periodically recorded
at adesso AG at customer level and analysed by the
Executive Board in terms of necessary adjustments.
Any identified need for action will be implemented
by sales wherever possible, which has anchored the
relevant elements in its target-based system. Real-
ised increases of daily rates are recorded for each cus-
tomer anda price history is maintained. Daily rates
were increased slightly in many cases among existing
customers during 2016, with new customers tending
to pay significantly more than the average daily rate.
However, it was not possible to increase the prices
paid by several major customers. It was not necessary
to accepta price reduction with any of the ten leading
customers (previous year: none). The risk of insuffi-
ciently rising daily rates compared to salary increases
and prices on the cost side therefore remains, but has
not increased compared to the previous year.

Risks from the Development of New Products and
Solutions

Since 2012, the adesso Group has significantly
increased its investment in the development of new
products and solutions and, therefore, shifted the
risk profile of its heavily service-oriented business
model towards its product business.

The volume of investment was substantial in relation
to the consolidated income statement and, asa result,
was included as one of the main risks in 2012. Devel-
opment of dynamic.suite, the company’s single most
important development, was stopped in mid-2012;
investments made thus far have been lost. While this
underscores the relevance of this risk, it has declined
due to a reduction in investment in 2013 and has
been reassigned to the other relevant risk category.
With its solutions for the insurance sector, adesso
is now pursuing the strategy of becoming one of the
most important providers of software solutions for
the insurance industry in addition to its service busi-
ness. With this aim in mind, the company is carry-

59
60

adesso Group

Annual Report 2016

ing out major development projects for customers in
the health insurance, property insurance and vehi-
cle insurance segments. The available life insurance
system is being marketed broadly. All these products
involve increasing risk from service and maintenance
obligations. In the development phase, there is also
increased risk from higher than planned develop-
ment costs, for which adesso is partially responsi-
ble. However, those risks are offset by opportunities
for considerable income from licences and mainte-
nance. The risk remains unchanged due to the stage
of the development of health insurance and property
insurance interpreted positively by new customers.

Risks from Regulatory Law

Asa listed company on the regulated market, adesso
AG is subject to a number of additional legal regula-
tions and obligations. adesso follows corresponding
developments in case law, obtains assessments from
experience solicitors and familiarises its entire work-
force with the fulfilment of the legal obligations of
a listed company. It has established the position ofa
Compliance Officer, maintains an insider directory
and continuously identifies transactions that could
either constitute breaches of insider trading regula-
tions or could lead to imbalances in the information
supplied to the capital market.

In 2015, BaFin reviewed and objected to an ad-hoc
release from 2014 regarding suspicion of incomplete
and late publication. The matter was handed over to
the corresponding department of the federal agency
for follow-up. The department requested that adesso
providea further statementin February 2017. IfBaFin
issues a fine as a result of the case, the fine guidelines
it published in November 2013 shall apply.

Other Risks

The risk manual specifies a number of other risks as
at the balance sheet date, the risk factor (probabil-
ity of occurrence multiplied by the expected average
loss) of which has not changed compared to the pre-
vious year and is lower than average. These risks are:

> risks from falling order backlog

> risks from insufficient sales pipeline

> change to market and competition structure
> liquidity risks from bank credit lines

> risks from falling market volume

> risks from technical infrastructure

> risks from lack of insurance cover

Overall Statement Concerning the Group’s Risk
Situation

The overall risk profile of adesso Group rose slightly
year on year by 16 points, or 3 %, to 492 points (pre-
vious year: declined by 6 % to 476 points). The fall
in risk from incorrect products and the solid order
backlog and sales pipeline asa result of the reception
of the in|sure product range for insurance companies
had a positive impact.

The increase in risk associated with the use of loss
carry-forwards following the reassessment of
e-Spirit Inc. as a limited-risk distributor and with
liquidity risks from the borrowing of further acqui-
sition loans had a negative impact. Due to the polit-
ical uncertainty following the US elections and the
Brexit referendum, and with upcoming elections in
Germany, France and the Netherlands, the risk of
planning adherence is considered higher. None of
the identified risks can be considered at the current
point in time as risks that endanger the existence of
the company as a going concern. However, the risks
detailed above could have a negative impact on the
Group’s asset, financial and earnings situation as well
as on business performance.

Opportunities

We have introduced a series of measures to identify,
assess and monitor opportunities for positive group
development. In order to do so, organisational units
were established to monitor portfolio development
within a particular industry, to assess new techno-
logical developments and to evaluate the suitability
of other industries for adesso.

With the group further increasing in size, the sys-
tematic networking ofall units within adesso Group
is leading to ever-increasing synergy effects, particu-
larly in sales, and an integrated service approach for
major customers.

In 2017, there will be a wide range of further oppor-
tunities to expand business activities and increase
profits. In terms of the in|sure product range for
insurance companies, the product geared towards
the next insurance sector was completed at the end of
2016, in the wake of in|sure Life and in|sure Health
for private health insurance companies. This product
range can be launched in 2017. The development of
the in|sure General segment for property insurance
companies is already at an advanced stage to enable
COMPANY

Risk Reports

the first sales cycle to begin. Further new customers
are expected to be attracted to in|sure on the basis of
the expanded range. The development of the vehi-
cle insurance segment offers further opportunities
in subsequent years.

In the Content Solutions segment, with the inter-
national product FirstSpirit, a range of further mod-
ules have been developed that open up potential for
further growth. FirstSpirit CaaS (Content as a Ser-
vice), companies can migrate their content manage-
ment systems into the digital world and future. CaaS
enables content to be provided for everything that
can be reached using the internet, both at the cur-
rent time and moving forward —- mobile apps, smart/
connected devices in the internet of things, shops,
portals, software or third-party websites. This can
be activated overnight without any additional imple-
mentation work. The entry to the US market, which
has been pursued for some time now, offers poten-
tial, as the USA is the world’s largest market for con-
tent management software.

The takeover of UnitCon GmbH at the start of 2017
adds valuable SAP skills, such as SAP CRM, SAP
Hybris Marketing and SAP HANA Analytics, to the
business activities and toolset of the adesso Group’s
E-Commerce business area. This consolidation of
e-commerce platform, customer management and
core ERP system makes adesso one of the largest
providers in the German-speaking world, putting
it in an outstanding position to rise to customers’
challenges in relation to digitalisation. New oppor-
tunities for the acquisition of large transformation
projects arise through the interplay with in-depth
knowledge of the core business processes and the
significant position of adesso mobile solutions.

In 2017, a great many activities and skills in the areas
of smart hosting, application operations and cloud
offers are to be migrated under the roof of adesso as
a service GmbH, formerly known as adesso hosting
services GmbH, with the company increasing its
footprint as a provider in this area as a result.

We have established our own platform to invest
in and develop start-up companies in the shape of
inQventures GmbH (www.inqventures.de). The
plan here is to make targeted investments in busi-
ness ideas and companies offering potential syner-
gies in adesso’s core sectors and act as a partner to

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SERVICE

start-ups by providing infrastructure, advice and
software development services and helping them
to gain market access as a means of testing the busi-
ness model. The aim here is to attract further equity
partners. Further opportunities can also open up for
the entire adesso Group on the basis of the business
models and adesso’s position as a driver of innova-
tion. In addition, value can be increased if compa-
nies in which adesso Group holds a stake develop
positively.

The increase in the number of employees during the
year and the continued pursuit of headcount growth,
in particular for adesso in Germany, once again offers
opportunities for growth that far outstrips general
market growth in 2017. This is supported by com-
pleted and planned office openings in Nuremberg,
Hanover, Essen and Aachen.

We continue to consider ourselves as an active con-
solidator in the IT market, even after the two major
company acquisitions in 2015 and 2016. This was
shown once again in early 2017 with the acquisition
of UnitCon GmbH. Possible M&A transactions offer
additional growth opportunities.

INTERNAL CONTROL
SYSTEM AND RISK
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
FOR THE CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTING PROCESS

In the accounting process, there is a risk that the
financial reports based on the accounts could con-
tain misrepresentations of facts that could havea sig-
nificant influence on decisions made by the intended
recipients of the reports.

These can include the misallocation of resources
and non-performance of certain measures by the
Executive Board in terms of the internal operational
management of the Group, as well as misinterpre-
tation on the part of report recipients, and particu-
larly existing and potential shareholders. The pro-
cesses and systems established at adesso are geared
toward identifying potential sources of errors in the
accounting process and thus limiting the resulting
risks. They are intended to ensure that the annual
report and consolidated financial statements are pre-
pared in accordance with legal requirements. The
report is standardised and identical in form for both
the management report of the annual financial state-
mentas well as for the group management report of
adesso AG.

At adesso, no control and risk management system
was defined and documented especially for the pur-
poses of the accounting process. There is no inter-
nal auditing structure or risk committee. No external
advisors or auditors were regularly engaged to review
the efficiency of the controls in place as part of the
consolidated accounting process.

A separate IT audit took place as part of the audit
of the annual financial statements in 2016, which
focused on the accounting system and the complete-
ness and transparency of accounting systems due to
the introduction of anew ERP system at adesso AG
in mid-2016.

The structure of the internal control mechanisms
and risk management system is primarily the result
of how the accounting and reporting processes are
organised. The majority of the accounting is car-

ried out decentrally by each of the Group’s subsidi-
aries. As the parent company, adesso AG performs
accounting services for some adesso Group compa-
nies together with centralised administrative pro-
cesses such as payroll accounting. These companies’
accounts are primarily kept on the same accounting
system as clients. The fact that the same people are
responsible for this process throughout the Group
and that the adesso AG CFO has ongoing, direct
access provides a good basis for the standardised,
correct representation of facts.

Almost all companies use a standardised consoli-
dated accounts system, minimising the number of
discrepancies from the standard style of accounts.
The detailed coverage of Group accounts means
that it is simple to coordinate internal Group per-
formance processes. The respective management
teams are responsible for individual annual finan-
cial statements. Each annual financial statement that
forms part of the consolidated financial statement is
reviewed by the group auditor in terms of its plau-
sibility and compliance with group standards, irre-
spective of any audits performed by the local auditor
or tax consultant. For this purpose, the auditor of the
consolidated financial statements visits the respec-
tive local auditor and inspects the documentation of
key group companies.

All individual financial statements are submitted to
a centralised consolidation system in adesso AG’s
Finance department and consolidated into the con-
solidated financial statement in accordance with the
IFRS reconciliation statement. The software solu-
tion specially procured for this purpose was audited
and certified in accordance with the “Erteilung und
Verwendung von Softwarebescheinigungen” audit-
ing standards (“Issuance and Use of Software Cer-
tificates”) published by the Institut der Wirtschaft-
prufer in Deutschland e.V. (IDW PS 880). All IFRS
reconciliation and consolidation processes are fully
documented and traceable.

The core elements of the control and risk manage-
ment system when it comes to accounting is the
monthly, standardised reporting of full monthly
financial statements on the basis of the consolidated
accounts system, the comparison ofactual data with
plan data and the update to the full-year forecast. A
member of the adesso AG Executive Board is directly
responsible for every company in adesso Group.

REMUNERATION
REPORT

Principles of the Remuneration System

Atadesso, variable remuneration systems are in place
throughout the group fora variety of functions. Man-
agement remuneration is primarily geared toward
the success of the company and industry standards.

In addition to fixed remuneration, the adesso AG
Executive Board is compensated depending on
the amount of operating earnings (in reference to
EBITDA), as well as earnings per share at the Group
level, constituting performance-based remunera-
tion. Part of the Executive Board’s variable remuner-
ation is share-based in the form of stock options and
virtual stock options, and phantom shares granted
to some members. The Executive Board participated
in the company-wide stock option scheme open to
many employees and which expired at the end of
2013. This was replaced by a model of virtual stock
options for the Executive Board. Since this model
has expired, no new virtual stock options are being
issued.

The members of the Supervisory Board are reim-
bursed for their expenses and also receive annual
remuneration.

Executive Board Remuneration

Basic remuneration is paid as a monthly salary and
is performance related. An annual pay rise of 1 %
was contractually agreed for the Executive Board
members appointed in each year up to and includ-
ing 2019. Negotiations for salary adjustments are
conducted when inflation exceeds 3 %. The mem-
bers of the Executive Board also receive payments in
kind and other remuneration, including the use ofa
company car, the reimbursement of travel expenses,
coverage of direct insurance premiums, a personal
pension and reimbursement of half the documented
premiums for voluntary health and nursing care
insurance.

Variable, Performance-based remuneration

The variable remuneration model for the Execu-
tive Board is based directly on the relevant met-
rics of EBITDA and earnings per share (EPS), which
are reported to adesso AG shareholders in the con-
solidated financial statements according to IFRS.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SERVICE

Variable remuneration increases proportionally to
EBITDA and EPS. Ata defined point, the increase is
limited to EUR 60 thousand for the EBITDA value
and EUR 90 thousand for the EPS value. One of two
different variants, which are differentiated by the
rate of increase and watershed, can be selected each
year.

Long-term remuneration

A phantom share programme for certain members
of the Executive Board and employees at the first
management level of adesso AG was approved by
the Supervisory Board in financial year 2009. It was
intended to help bind managers to the company in
the long term. The phantom shares participate in
dividends just like actual shares but the payments
are included in salaries. After being with the com-
pany for a term of five to eight years, the holders
of phantom shares have a right to receive the value
represented at the time by the number of phantom
shares and the underlying share price. Payment is
included in salaries. The members of the Execu-
tive Board obtained additional rights from these
phantom shares in 2016. In case a board member
leaves the Executive Board, the following has been
established with regard to the phantom share pro-
gramme: Ifa board member leaves before the end of
three years from the start of the programme (for one
board member, three years and eight months) due
to termination of contract, the board member only
has to return the shares in exchange for compensa-
tion in case of a change of control. This is the case
if shareholders Rainer Rudolf and Prof. Dr. Volker
Gruhn (or companies through which they hold their
shares) hold less than 35 % of the company’s share
capital through the sum of their shares. If a board
member leaves after at least three years (for one board
member, three years and eight months) because the
Supervisory Board dismisses the member, or due to
the termination of their contract, or if the company
fails to make a contract renewal offer at terms and
conditions at least equivalent to those of the current
contract, the board member has to return the shares.
Compensation is 75 % of the applicable value. If a
board member leaves after at least eight years (for
one board member, six years and eight months), the
shares have to be returned in exchange for compen-
sation.

The share option programme of adesso AG duly
expired on 31 December 2013. In view of the

65
66

adesso Group

Annual Report 2016

granted stock options, the Executive Board received
virtual stock options for financial year 2014. The aim
of the virtual stock options was that they are finan-
cially equal to option rights when post-tax income
is used for subscribing the virtual stock options in
order to buy adesso AG shares on the market. The
same conditions apply to virtual stock options as for
stock options granted by the programme expiring
on 31 December 2013. The number of virtual stock
options issued to the Executive Board depends on
the variable performance-based remuneration com-
ponent, which means it is also performance-based.
The virtual stock options only result in cash value
compensation if the exercise criteria are met after
the end of the minimum holding period. 140 virtual
stock options are granted for each EUR 1,000 paidas
the performance-based variable remuneration com-
ponent 1 fora year. The virtual stock options remain
valid even ifa board member leaves before exercising
the virtual stock options. Due to the further devel-
