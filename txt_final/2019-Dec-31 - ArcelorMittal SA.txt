Company overview
History and development of the Company

ArcelorMittal is the world’s leading integrated steel and
mining company. It results from the merger in 2007 of its
predecessor companies Mittal Steel Company N.V. and
Arcelor, each of which had grown through acquisitions over
many years. Since its creation ArcelorMittal has
experienced periods of external growth as well consolidation
and deleveraging (including through divestments), the latter
in particular during the years following the global financial
and economic crises of 2008-2010. In recent years
ArcelorMittal has punctuated its overall deleveraging focus
with targeted acquisitions. These have included the
acquisition through a joint venture of the Calvert plant in the
United States in 2014 and, in 2018 the acquisition of AMSF
in Brazil and ArcelorMittal Italia in Italy, Europe's largest
single steel site. In 2019, the Company completed its
acquisition of AMNS India through a joint venture with NSC.
For more information on the key transactions carried out in
2019, see “—Key transactions and events in 2019” below.

ArcelorMittal's success is built on its core values of
sustainability, quality and leadership and the entrepreneurial
boldness that has empowered its emergence as the first
truly global steel and mining company. Acknowledging that a
combination of structural issues and macroeconomic
conditions will continue to challenge returns in its sector, the
Company has adapted its footprint to the new demand
realities, redoubled its efforts to control costs and
repositioned its operations with a view toward outperforming
its competitors. ArcelorMittal’s research and development
capability is strong and includes several major research
centers as well as strong academic partnerships with
universities and other scientific bodies.

Against this backdrop, ArcelorMittal's strategy is to leverage
four distinctive attributes that will enable it to capture leading
positions in the most attractive areas of the steel industry's
value chain, from mining at one end to distribution and first-
stage processing at the other: global scale and scope;
superior technical capabilities; a diverse portfolio of steel
and related businesses, one of which is mining; and
financial capabilities.

Geography: ArcelorMittal is the largest steel producer in the
Americas, Africa and Europe and is the fifth largest steel
producer in the CIS region. ArcelorMittal has steel-making
operations in 18 countries on four continents, including 46
integrated and mini-mill steel-making facilities. As of
December 31, 2019, ArcelorMittal had approximately
191,000 employees.

ArcelorMittal’s steel-making operations have a high degree
of geographic diversification. Approximately 37% of its crude
steel is produced in the Americas, approximately 49% is
produced in Europe and approximately 14% is produced in

other countries, such as Kazakhstan, South Africa and
Ukraine. In addition, ArcelorMittal’s sales of steel products
are spread over both developed and developing markets,
which have different consumption characteristics.
ArcelorMittal’s mining operations, present in North and
South America, Africa, Europe and the CIS region, are
integrated with its global steel-making facilities and are
important producers of iron ore and coal in their own right.

Products: ArcelorMittal produces a broad range of high-
quality finished and semi-finished steel products (“semis”).
Specifically, ArcelorMittal produces flat steel products,
including sheet and plate, and long steel products, including
bars, rods and structural shapes. In addition, ArcelorMittal
produces pipes and tubes for various applications.
ArcelorMittal sells its steel products primarily in local
markets and through its centralized marketing organization
to a diverse range of customers in approximately 160
countries including the automotive, appliance, engineering,
construction and machinery industries. The Company also
produces various types of mining products including iron ore
lump, fines, concentrate and sinter feed, as well as coking,
PCI and thermal coal.

As a global steel producer, the Company is able to meet the
needs of different markets. Steel consumption and product
requirements clearly differ between developed markets and
developing markets. Steel consumption in developed
economies is weighted towards flat products and a higher
value-added mix, while developing markets utilize a higher
proportion of long products and commodity grades. To meet
these diverse needs, the Company maintains a high degree
of product diversification and seeks opportunities to
increase the proportion of higher value-added products in its
product mix.

Automotive focus: ArcelorMittal has a leading market share
in its core markets in the automotive steel business and is a
leader in the fast-growing advanced high strength steels
segment. ArcelorMittal is the first steel company in the world
to embed its own engineers within an automotive customer
to provide engineering support. The Company begins
working with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) as
early as five years before a vehicle reaches the showroom,
to provide generic steel solutions, co-engineering and help
with the industrialization of the project. In November 2016,
ArcelorMittal introduced a new generation of advanced high
strength steels, including new press hardenable steels and
martensitic steels. Together, these new steel grades aim to
help automakers further reduce body-in-white weight to
improve fuel economy without compromising vehicle safety
or performance. In November 2017, ArcelorMittal launched
the second generation of its iCARe® electrical steels.
iCARe® steel grades play a central role in the construction
of electric motors.

Mining Value Chain: ArcelorMittal has a significant portfolio
of raw material and mining assets. In 2019, approximately


--- Page 2 ---

52% of ArcelorMittal’s iron-ore requirements and
approximately 12% of its PCI and coal requirements were
supplied from its own mines. The Company currently has
iron ore mining activities in Brazil, Bosnia, Canada,
Kazakhstan, Liberia, Mexico, Ukraine and the United States.
The Company currently has coal mining activities in
Kazakhstan and the United States.

In addition, ArcelorMittal produces substantial amounts of
direct reduced iron, or DRI, which is a scrap substitute used
in its mini-mill facilities to supplement external metallics
purchases. ArcelorMittal is also a significant producer of
coke, which is produced from metallurgical coal and is a
critical raw material for steel-making, satisfying 95% of its
coke needs through its own production facilities.
ArcelorMittal’s facilities have good access to shipping
facilities, including through ArcelorMittal’s own, or partially
owned, 15 deep-water port facilities and linked railway
sidings.

ArcelorMittal has its own downstream steel distribution
business, primarily run through its Europe segment. It also
provides value-added and customized steel solutions
through additional processing activities to meet specific
customer requirements.

Key factors affecting results of operations

The steel industry, and the iron ore and coal mining
industries, which provide its principal raw materials, have
historically been highly cyclical. They are significantly
affected by general economic conditions, consumption
trends as well as by worldwide production capacity and
fluctuations in international steel trade and tariffs. This is
due to the cyclical nature of the automotive, construction,
machinery and equipment and transportation industries that
are the principal consumers of steel. A telling example of the
industry cyclicality was the sharp downturn in 2008/2009
after several strong years, which was a result of the global
economic crisis. Such cyclicality, though to a lesser degree
than in 2008/2009, was seen again in the downturns
experienced in 2015 and 2019.

Weakness in North American and European markets have a
significant impact on ArcelorMittal’s results, with these
markets together accounting for over 60% of ArcelorMittal's
deliveries in 2019, despite demand declining in both
markets. In the European Union (“EU”), 2019 was the first
year to show a decline in demand since 2012, when the
onset of the eurozone crisis caused European apparent
steel demand to decline over 10%. Since then, EU steel
demand rebounded by 18% until 2018, returning to the
average demand levels seen during the period between
2000 to 2005 but remaining almost 20% below 2007 peak
levels. During this same period, import competition also
increased, with imports more than doubling since 2012 to
over 31 million tonnes in 2018, meaning domestic European
deliveries have lost market share, impacting the ability of
ArcelorMittal to serve its largest market. Steel demand fell
by around 4% in the EU in 2019 as underlying real demand
declined by approximately 2.5%, driven by macroeconomic
headwinds including declining automobile production,
coupled with significant destocking, which negatively
impacted apparent steel demand by a further 2%.
Underlying steel demand in the United States increased
strongly following the 2008/2009 financial crisis, but
apparent demand has been affected by inventory
movements, since demand peaked in 2014. Although the
decline in apparent demand for flat products in 2019 at
around -4.7% was less severe than the decline in 2015
(-8.6%) and both of these declines were exacerbated by
significant destocking. This was due to underlying real steel
demand weakening more than was anticipated at the start
of the year, coupled by steel prices falling from high levels,
resulting in stockists and later end-users, reducing inventory
levels, which negatively impacted the Company's deliveries
and profitability. Although the Company does not anticipate
an economic recession in the United States over the next
twelve months, as the country is in the longest economic
expansion on record and given the frailty of the current
global economic outlook, any new economic downturn could
significantly impact ArcelorMittal’s deliveries and profitability.

See "Risks related to the global economy and the mining
and steel industry."

Demand dynamics in China have also substantially affected
the global steel business. Historically, after growing strongly
since 2000, Chinese steel demand started to decline in
2015 because of weaker real estate sector construction and
machinery production. This decline in domestic demand led
to a surge in Chinese steel exports, which more than
doubled between 2012 and 2015, increasing by over 56
million tonnes to 112 million tonnes in 2015. This increase in
Chinese exports was greater than the growth in world ex-
China steel demand over the same period, and had the
effect of curtailing domestic production in countries outside
of China. A rebound in domestic demand and the beginning
of a capacity reduction plan in China in the second half of
2016 led to a decline in exports, by 14% year-on-year in the
second half of 2016 and by 3% for the year as whole. While
most exports were directed to Asia, and exports to the U.S.
were limited due to the impact of anti-dumping trade cases,
a declining but still significant proportion were directed
toward ArcelorMittal’s core European markets in 2016.
Indeed, Chinese exports in 2015 were being sold at prices
below cost (China Iron and Steel Association (CISA)
reported CISA mills losing an accumulated RMB 65 billion
($10 billion) in 2015), negatively impacting prices and
therefore margins in many regions. Chinese producers
continued to accumulate losses until April 2016 when
domestic and export prices rose sharply as domestic
demand surprised producers on the upside, increasing
capacity utilization. Between mid 2016 and early 2018,
significant capacity had been closed, consisting of over 150
million tonnes of legal blast furnace capacity and an
estimated 120 million tonnes of illegal induction furnaces.
This led to a significantly higher capacity utilization rate,
despite a 40 million tonnes reduction in exports over the
past few years, translating into an improved domestic
spread of steel prices over raw material costs, and therefore
higher export prices. Starting in October 2017, this situation,
combined with environmental policies which led to
temporary capacity restrictions over the winter period,
caused even higher utilization rates in China and an even
higher spread of steel prices over raw materials. Prices
have since fallen back as these temporary capacity
restrictions have been less strictly enforced and the risk of
continued capacity increases remains. The Company
expects Chinese steel demand to grow in 2020 within a
range of +0.0% to +1.0% (versus estimated growth of
+3.2% in 2019) driven by robust real estate activity and
given the Company's current view on the Coronavirus. This
may be revised downward due to the impact of the
Coronavirus on Chinese demand and the knock-on impact
elsewhere. However, demand is eventually expected to
decline as infrastructure spending has been front-loaded
and real estate demand structurally weakens due to lower
levels of rural-urban migration. If this does not coincide with
renewed capacity closures, this is expected to have a


--- Page 4 ---

negative impact on steel prices and spreads. See “—Risks
related to the global economy and the mining and steel
industry—Excess capacity and oversupply in the steel
industry and in the iron ore mining industry have in the past
and may continue in the future to weigh on the profitability of
steel producers, including ArcelorMittal.”

Unlike many commodities, steel is not completely fungible
due to wide differences in its shape, chemical composition,
quality, specifications and application, all of which affect
sales prices. Accordingly, there is still limited exchange
trading and uniform pricing of steel, whereas there is
increasing trading of steel raw materials, particularly iron
ore. Commodity spot prices can vary, which causes sale
prices from exports to fluctuate as a function of the
worldwide balance of supply and demand at the time sales
are made.

ArcelorMittal’s sales are made based on shorter-term
purchase orders as well as some longer-term contracts to
certain industrial customers, particularly in the automotive
industry. Steel price surcharges are often implemented on
steel sold pursuant to long-term contracts to recover
increases in input costs; however longer term contracts with
low steel prices will not reflect increases in spot steel prices
that occur after contract negotiation. Spot market steel, iron
ore and coal prices and short-term contracts are more
driven by market conditions.

One of the principal factors affecting the Company’s
operating profitability is the relationship between raw
material prices and steel selling prices. Profitability depends
in part on the extent to which steel selling prices exceed raw
material prices, and specifically the extent to which changes
in raw material prices are passed through to customers in
steel selling prices. Complicating factors include the extent
of the time lag between (a) the raw material price change
and the steel selling price change and (b) the date of the
raw material purchase and of the actual sale of the steel
product in which the raw material was used (average cost
basis). In recent periods, steel selling prices have not
always been correlated with changes in raw material prices,
although steel selling prices may also be impacted quickly
due in part to the tendency of distributors to increase
purchases of steel products early in a rising cycle of raw
material prices and to hold back from purchasing as raw
material prices decline. With respect to (b), as average cost
basis is used to determine the cost of the raw materials
incorporated, inventories must first be worked through
before a decrease in raw material prices translates into
decreased operating costs. In some of ArcelorMittal’s
segments, in particular Europe and NAFTA, there are
several months between raw material purchases and sales
of steel products incorporating those materials. Although
this lag has been reduced recently by changes to the timing
of pricing adjustments in iron ore contracts, it cannot be
eliminated and exposes these segments’ margins to
changes in steel selling prices in the interim (known as a

Management report 7

“price-cost squeeze”). This lag can result in inventory write-
downs, as occurred in 2015 and 2019 due to sharp declines
in steel prices. In addition, decreases in steel prices may
outstrip decreases in raw material costs in absolute terms,
as has occurred numerous times over the past few years,
for example throughout 2019 as well as the fourth quarters
of 2015, 2016 and 2018.

The Company's operating profitability has been particularly
sensitive to fluctuations in raw material prices, which have
become more volatile since the iron ore industry moved
away from annual benchmark pricing to quarterly pricing in
2010. Volatility on steel margins aside, the results of the
Company's mining segment (which sells externally as well
as internally) are also directly impacted by iron ore prices,
which decreased significantly in 2015, ending the year at
$40 per tonne ("/t") and averaging only $56/t. Iron ore (62%
Fe) prices rebounded from $40/t during December 2015 to
an average of $58/t during 2016, and the upward trend
continued into the first quarter of 2017 with an average of
$86/t, and then fluctuated between $60-75/t during most of
the following two years, leading to an annual average of
$71/t in 2017 and $69/t in 2018. Vale’s Brumadinho dam
disaster at the end of January 2019, coupled with strong
steel production in China during the first half of 2019,
pushed the price up to highs above $120/t in July. Vale
managed to bring back 35 million tonnes of supply by the
end of 2019, allowing the price to decline to an average of
$92/t during December 2019 as supply better matched
levels of demand. Iron ore prices have so far remained
slightly above these levels during January 2020 but should
iron ore prices decline significantly from these levels as
further supply is brought online and especially if Chinese
demand weakens, this would negatively impact
ArcelorMittal’s revenues and profitability. See Risks related
to the global economy and the mining and steel industry—
Protracted low steel and iron ore prices would likely have an
adverse effect on ArcelorMittal’s results of operations.

Economic environment

Global growth in 2019 is estimated to have been 2.6% - its
lowest level since the global financial crisis ("GFC") in
2008/09. This subdued growth is a consequence of rising
trade barriers, elevated uncertainty surrounding trade and
geopolitical issues and the impact of prior U.S. interest rate
increases which had a tightening effect on financing
conditions in emerging economies ("EM"s). A notable
feature of the sluggish growth in 2019 was the sharp and
geographically broad-based slowdown in manufacturing and
global trade. A few factors drove this slowdown, including
higher tariffs and prolonged uncertainty surrounding trade
policy which dented investment and demand for capital
goods that are heavily traded. The automobile industry is
continuing to contract due to distinct reasons, including
lower demand and disruptions from new emission standards
in Europe and China. Consequently, global import volume
growth in 2019 declined to less than 1%, the weakest level


--- Page 5 ---

8 Management report

since 2015. In contrast to weak manufacturing and trade,
the services sector across much of the globe continues to
hold up, which has kept labor markets buoyant and wage
growth healthy in advanced economies.

U.S. GDP growth decelerated to 2.4% in 2019 from 2.9% in
2018, amid slowing investment and exports as the
heightened uncertainty due to trade policy and increasing
perceived risk of recession caused businesses to scale
back investment. Escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict
led to increased U.S. tariffs of 25% (from 10%) on $250
billion of Chinese imports, and imposed 15% tariffs on an
additional $160 billion. While the recent “Phase-One” trade
deal with China rolled back some of the tariffs (15% tariff
halved to 7.5%), rising tariffs increased trade costs in 2019,
while policy uncertainty weighed on investment and
confidence. As in many other advanced economies, the
U.S. manufacturing sector has been weak, while support
from tax cuts and changes in government spending faded
and became a drag on growth. Despite these headwinds,
the labor market has remained robust and benefited from a
rising participation rate. The unemployment rate of 3.5%
which was reached at certain points of 2019 was near a
decade low and wage growth has been solid, fueling
resilient private consumption. However, concerns about the
global outlook and persistent below-target inflation have
resulted in the Federal Reserve cutting its policy rates by 75
basis points since mid-2019. See "Risks related to the
global economy and the mining and steel industry". Unfair
trade practices in ArcelorMittal’s home markets could
negatively affect steel prices and reduce ArcelorMittal’s
profitability, while trade sanctions and barriers may have an
adverse effect on ArcelorMittal’s operations in various
markets.

After reaching a cyclical peak of 2.7% in 2017, EU GDP
growth slowed notably to 2.0% in 2018 and 1.4% in 2019.
The main source of the slowdown has been weaker external
demand, including from Turkey and Asia, especially China.
External trade drove most of the volatility in eurozone
growth in recent years, with exports contracting during
2019. While the U.S.-China trade war was partly
responsible, exports to Asia have fallen, other impacts
include Brexit-related uncertainty and especially Turkey's
recession reducing external demand from the automotive
sector, which was exacerbated by the disruption caused by
emission standards. Several economies were on the verge
of recession at some point during 2019, particularly
Germany as its industrial sector was exposed to weakness
in external trade and disruptions to car production. By
contrast, domestic fundamentals in Europe remain strong,
with unemployment having fallen to 6.3% in 2019 the lowest
level since the GFC and increasing real wages supporting
household consumption. As a result, the European economy
remains dominated by the wide divergence between
resilient activity in services and a struggling manufacturing
sector.

Growth in China slowed from 6.6% in 2018 to a still robust
6.2% in 2019, supported by resilient consumption. Growth
has decelerated amid cooling domestic demand and
heightened trade tensions, with trade policy uncertainty
weighing on sentiment for most of 2019. Industrial
production growth has reached multi-year lows (5.5% in
2019) and trade flows have weakened substantially.
Imports, especially those of intermediate goods, have
declined, falling more than exports, partly reflecting a
deceleration in domestic demand. The contraction in
exports to the U.S. deepened due to the escalation in trade
tensions resulting in new tariffs imposed on Chinese exports
to the U.S. (although some tariffs have been reduced since
the "Phase-One" trade deal discussed above was reached),
though shipments to the rest of the world were somewhat
more resilient. In response to the deceleration in activity,
monetary policy has become more accommodative, but
regulatory tightening to reduce non-bank lending has
continued. The government has also stepped up some fiscal
measures, including tax cuts and increased bond issuances
by the central government to support local governments’
public infrastructure investment spending. As a result, total
debt has surpassed 260% of GDP, but the share of non-
bank lending has continued to decline.

GDP growth in Brazil slowed slightly to 1.2% in 2019
(compared to 1.3% in 2018), largely due to weak growth in
the first half of 2019, reflecting the impact of the iron ore
dam disaster (Brumadinho) which caused a contraction in
mining output and the recession in Argentina - Brazil’s
largest trading partner - leading to weaker export growth. In
Russia, growth weakened to 1.3% (compared to 2.3% in
2018) due to slower investment growth as high funding
costs due to the risk of further sanctions dampened private
investment, while slow implementation of the infrastructure-
related national projects impacted public investment.
Exports have also fallen, due to lower oil prices, while an
increase in VAT negatively impacted private consumption.
Following the sharp lira depreciation and associated
recession in late-2018, Turkey’s economy recovered during
the second half of 2019, with 2019 growth averaging 0.3%,
supported by expansionary fiscal policy and rapid credit
expansion by state-owned banks. In South Africa, growth
remained subdued at 0.3% in 2019 (down from 0.8% in
2018) due to infrastructure bottlenecks - especially in
electricity supply - and weakening external demand,
particularly from the eurozone and China. Slowing global
trade, a weakness in global automotive sales and
destocking, have negatively impacted global manufacturing,
with output growth slowing in 2019 to an estimated 1.9%
(down from 3.8% in 2018). While growth in manufacturing
output in China weakened to 5.7% (down from 6.3% in
2018), world-ex China manufacturing output declined by
approximately 0.4%. The main impacts came from
developed markets, where manufacturing output is
estimated to have contracted by approximately 0.9% in
2019, offsetting an estimated 0.8% growth in output from


--- Page 6 ---

developing markets ex-China. European manufacturing has
been impacted by weakness in automotive production which
has impacted Europe more than the U.S., with output
estimated to have declined by 0.8% while output in the U.S.
was broadly stable in 2019.

Global apparent steel consumption (“ASC”) is estimated to
have grown by 1.1% in 2019 following strong growth of
2.4% in 2018. ASC growth in China remained resilient at
3%, primarily driven by construction, supporting robust
machinery output, offsetting declining automotive output and
slower growth in infrastructure. World-ex China ASC is
down by around 0.8% year-on-year. Demand in developing
ex-China is estimated to have declined by an estimated
1.2% year-on-year, due to domestic crises in some large
emerging markets causing steel demand to decline sharply
in Turkey (-10% year-on-year), Iran (-7% year-on-year) and
Argentina (-14% year-on-year). This more than offset growth
in India (+4% year-on-year), ASEAN (+3% year-on-year)
and Russia (+4% year-on-year). In EU28, underlying
demand for steel was impacted by weak manufacturing,
particularly automotive and machinery, due to weaker
external demand and heightened uncertainty related to both
the U.S.-China trade conflict and Brexit. Weakness in real
demand led to inventory destocking, causing ASC to decline
by over 4% in 2019. While underlying demand for steel in
the US performed better than EU28, U.S. ASC is estimated
to have declined by around 2% year-on-year, with
construction performing better than manufacturing. Indeed,
due to weaker than expected manufacturing output, and
prices declining from elevated levels, stockists reduced
inventory levels causing demand for flat products to decline
over 4% year-on-year, more than offsetting continued
growth in longs.

Steel production

After growing strongly in 2017 (+6.3%) and 2018 (+4.7%),
reaching 1.79 billion tonnes in 2018, world crude steel
production in 2019 is estimated to have increased 3.5%
year-on-year to 1.85 billion tonnes, primarily driven by
increased production in China. In 2019, China accounted for
52% of global steel production, East Asia 12%, EU28 9%,
NAFTA 7%, India 6%, CIS 6% and the rest of the world 8%.
World ex-China production declined by 1.6% (down 14
million tonnes) as the higher output in the U.S. (+1.5%),
India (+1.8%) and Middle East (+20%) was not enough to
offset lower output in other developed markets, particularly
in the EU (-4.9%) and Developed Asia (-3.6%), and in some
emerging markets, including Turkey (-9.6%) and South
America (-8.4%).

Chinese steel production data over the past few years has
been subject to increased uncertainty due to under-
reporting, particularly at illegal induction furnaces ("IF"s)
after most were closed during 2017. Since IF production

Management report 9

was mostly unrecorded in the official figures previously, and
this production has moved to mills whose production is
recorded officially, it led to official estimates of production
growing more strongly than actual production output as
estimated by ArcelorMittal. Although the Company believes
that the most recent production data is broadly accurate, it
estimates that production was under-recorded until
mid-2018, meaning that the World Steel Association's
growth rate of 8.3% in 2019 is overstated (as are growth
rates in 2017 and 2018). ArcelorMittal's crude steel
production estimates are consistent with its belief that
Chinese steel demand grew just over 3%, supported by the
Company's proprietary bottom-up steel demand modeling,
as well as China’s production and trade in raw materials and
metallics.

World ex-China steel production declined in 2019 as
production in all major regions either fell or stagnated,
except for the Middle East, where output rose by 7.3 million
tonnes, largely due to Iran, where output grew more than
30% year-on-year. In 2018, production in the EU28 (168
million tonnes) was curtailed by increased import
penetration despite continued demand growth and due to
weakness in German steel production. In 2019, while a
sharp fall in domestic European steel prices led to lower
import penetration, steel production in EU28 declined by
approximately 9 million tonnes to 159 million tonnes as the
weakness in industrial output, particularly automotive
production, led to much weaker steel demand. In North
America, strong production growth in 2018 (4.4% year-on-
year) was driven by U.S. fiscal stimulus and supported by
Section 232 applied tariffs and quotas on steel imports. As
the impact of the U.S. fiscal stimulus faded and North
America steel demand fell, steel production in 2019 declined
slightly (-0.8% year-on-year) due to weaker manufacturing
with lower production in Mexico (-8.0%) and Canada
(-4.9%) more than offsetting growth in the U.S. (+1.5%). The
decline in steel output in South America was mainly caused
by a 9% decline in Brazil production (down 3.2 million
tonnes). Production in Developed Asia fell by 3.6% year-on-
year (down 7 million tonnes), particularly Japan (-4.8%) and
South Korea (-1.5%). Weakness in CIS steel production is
due to persistent weakness in Ukrainian steel production
(2019 production of 21 million tonnes is one third below the
2011 peak of 35 million tonnes), while Russian production
declined slightly to 71.2 million tonnes from its historically
high production in 2018 (approximately 72 million tonnes).
After increasing 13.1% year-on-year to a record 37.5 million
tonnes in 2017, Turkish steel production fell significantly to
33.4 million tonnes in 2019 as the economy suffered from a
domestic recession triggered by a lira crisis in late 2018
which led to a collapse in domestic demand, especially in
the construction sector.

Steel prices
Flat products

Steel prices for flat products in Europe were stable in
Southern Europe and on a slight upward trend in Northern
Europe during the first quarter of 2017 compared to
December 2016. Prices of hot rolled coil (“HRC”) increased
in Northern Europe by €69/t quarter-on-quarter and in
Southern Europe by €63/t quarter-on-quarter. Prices
weakened in the second quarter of 2017 with an average
price decline of €47/t in Europe. The average HRC prices
for the first half of 2017 were at €545/t in Northern Europe
and €513/t in Southern Europe compared to the first half of
2016. Prices bottomed out in July 2017, thus the downtrend
reversed during August and September 2017. In the third
quarter of 2017, spot HRC prices in Northern Europe
remained €5/t below the second quarter 2017 average, and
in Southern Europe there was an average increase of €9/t
quarter-on-quarter.

There was little fluctuation in prices in the fourth quarter of
2017, with a quarter-on-quarter improvement of €22/t in
Northern Europe and €11/t in Southern Europe. HRC prices
during the second half of 2017 increased €65/t in Northern
Europe and €67/t in Southern Europe compared to the
second half of 2016.

In the first quarter of 2018, steel prices for flat products in
Europe continued their steady upward trend which started in
November 2017. HRC prices peaked towards the end of
March at €574/t in Northern Europe. In Southern Europe,
HRC prices increased from €519/t in January to €558/t at
the beginning of March. In the second quarter of 2018,
prices decreased sharply in USD terms following the
international market trend. However, the depreciation of the
euro against the USD helped sustain domestic HRC prices
in euro terms, with a low of €561/t in Northern Europe at the
beginning of June 2018, €13 below its peak in April 2018. In
Southern Europe, HRC prices bottomed out at €514/t by
mid-June 2018 from a peak of €544/t in April 2018. Average
HRC prices were €564/t in Northern Europe and €538/t in
Southern Europe for the first half of 2018, compared to
€545/t in Northern Europe and €513/t in Southern Europe
for the first half of 2017. The provisional safeguard
measures and tariff rate quotas implemented in July 2018
did not create a tangible effect on market protection in
Europe and there was very limited improvement in flat
products prices during the third quarter of 2018. In Northern
Europe HRC prices increased slightly in euro terms
compared to the June level but only to reach a quarterly
average of €566/t representing a €1/t decrease quarter-on-
quarter, while in Southern Europe the price improvement
averaged at €537/t representing a €7/t increase over the
second quarter level. In USD terms, however, prices
declined across the regions due to further euro depreciation
against USD. Market seasonality, high inventory levels and
imports pressured prices during the fourth quarter of 2018

and HRC prices declined in euro and USD terms both in
Northern Europe by €18/t to €548/t and in Southern Europe
by €38/t to €499/t compared to the third quarter of 2018
average levels. Overall, the second half 2018 HRC prices
averaged at €557/t in Northern Europe and at €518/t in
Southern Europe, corresponding to a €30/t and €13/t year-
on-year increase, respectively.

In the first quarter of 2019, steel prices for flat products in
Europe continued their steady downward trend which
started in September 2018. The prices of HRC in Northern
Europe reached €517/t in January 2019, finishing the
quarter €8/t lower, at €509/t. The decrease was attributable
to weak domestic demand in the beginning of the year, high
levels of inventories and the influence of declining
international steel prices. In Southern Europe, HRC prices
followed an inversed trend starting at €470/t in January and
closing the quarter at €486/t, €16/t higher. This inversed
trend was partially driven by a stronger demand in Southern
Europe and partially by the Turkish imports that were
entering the Italian market with higher price ranges between
€495/t-€500/t Cost, Insurance and Freight Free Out
(“CIFFO”) effective. Domestic mills followed the Turkish
import prices.

In the second quarter of 2019, prices in Northern Europe
continued to decrease and ended the quarter at €487/t,
which was €11/t lower compared to April 2019. HRC prices
in the Southern regions followed the same trend from the
previous quarter peaking in June at €472/t, from €469/t in
April. Turkish suppliers continued with their export offers of
€470/t-€480/t CIFFO effective into Italy and Iberia, providing
room for further increases in Southern European domestic
prices, given there was no import price pressure. The
average HRC prices for the first half of 2019 were €499/t in
Northern Europe and €472/t in Southern Europe, which
were accordingly €65 and €66/t lower than in the first half of
2018.

Flat products prices continued to slide down in the third
quarter of 2019, impacted by soft demand and weakening
international raw material prices. HRC in Northern Europe
had several trenches of price drops, ending the quarter at
€469/t, which was €18/t lower versus the previous quarter.
In Southern Europe the price of HRC averaged €453/t,
which was €19/t lower compared to the second quarter of
2019. Market seasonality, high inventory levels and import
pressure during the fourth quarter of 2019 pushed the HRC
prices on a downward spiral. Several attempts of price
increases were rejected by the market, as real demand in
Europe was weak. In Northern Europe, HRC prices ended
the fourth quarter at €431/t, which was €38 lower quarter-
on-quarter and in Southern Europe, HRC averaged €413/t
in the fourth quarter of 2019, €40/t lower than the previous
quarter. In the second half of 2019, HRC prices averaged
€450/t in Northern Europe and €433/t in Southern Europe
respectively €107/t and €85/t lower than the second half of
2018.

In the United States, HRC spot prices increased during the
first quarter of 2017 by an average of $106/t quarter-on-
quarter. Price levels improved sharply during January, had
stability during February and peaked at $725/t by end of
March 2017, to reach their highest average level since
September 2014. During the second quarter of 2017, HRC
spot prices decreased $11/t quarter-on-quarter, with
progressive declines until the first week of June 2017, but
were followed by a price pickup, sustained by declining
inventories and improved international market sentiment.
The average HRC price in the United States during the first
half of 2017 was $688/t compared to the first half of 2016 at
$547/t. The HRC spot price slightly improved in July and
August, and stabilized towards the end of the third quarter
of 2017, increasing $4/t quarter-on-quarter. Slight declines
were recorded during October, but prices picked up during
November and December to reach $704/t by the end of
2017. The average prices during the fourth quarter of 2017
decreased $2/t quarter-on-quarter. Overall, in the second
half of 2017 prices averaged at $686/t, representing a $68/t
increase compared to the second half of 2016.

In the United States, as a consequence of the then-ongoing
Section 232 national security investigation which started in
April 2017 and the expectation of the imminent
implementation of import tariffs on steel, spot HRC prices
increased sharply during the first quarter of 2018. Before the
release of the investigation report by the Department of
Commerce on February 16, 2018, HRC prices reached
$830/t from $723/t at the beginning of January 2018. After
the release of the report that recommended tariffs in the
range of 24 to 53%, prices spiked further to $936/t at the
beginning of March 2018. The increase slowed down as
25% tariffs and exceptions went into effect during March
2018, closing the month at a high of $960/t. In the second
quarter of 2018, HRC prices surpassed the $1,000/t level in
the United States, peaking at $1,012/t by the end of June.
The average HRC prices were $907/t for the first half of
2018 in the United States, as compared to $688/t for the
first half of 2017, corresponding to a $219/t increase year-
on-year. HRC prices hit a 10 year high of $1,014/t at the
beginning of July 2018 in the United States. However,
market seasonality and weakening of the international
prices in the second part of the year coupled with an
increase in the domestic capacity utilization rate (thus an
increase in domestic supply), resulted in consistent price
deterioration, with HRC prices falling to $799/t by the end of
the year. Third quarter HRC prices averaged $982/t, still $2/t
above the second quarter level, while average prices
declined in the fourth quarter by $99/t quarter-on-quarter to
$883/t. Overall, average HRC prices for the second half of
2018 were $932/t as compared to $686/t for the second half
of 2017 corresponding to a $246/t increase year-on-year.

In the United States, domestic HRC prices in the first half of
2019 continued the downward trend that began in July
2018. The first quarter of 2019 started with prices at $776/t

Management report 1

in January and in March reached $767/t ($9/t lower). Prices
in the second quarter of 2019 plunged even deeper - from
$749/t in April to $598/t in June (a drop of $151/t), well
below import parity levels. This descent represents the
market's search for an equilibrium point after additional local
capacity came on-stream in the second half of 2018. This
additional supply availability added pressure on domestic
prices at the same time as domestic mills were fighting
imports. U.S. suppliers’ short lead time combined with
comfortable inventory levels at customers contributed to the
downward trend in domestic prices.

The average HRC price for the first half of 2019 in the
United States was $723/t, as compared to $907/t for the first
half of 2018 (a drop of $184/t). The anticipated decline in
imports, as an outcome of the implementation of the Section
232 import tariffs was not as strong as expected. Therefore,
import prices continued to add pressure on the domestic
pricing. The HRC import Houston DDP index continued to
decline over the first half of 2019, from $746/t in the first
quarter to $685/t in the second quarter.

In the second half of 2019, the average HRC price in the
United States was $603/t, $330/t below the second half of
2018. The dramatic decrease is due to 2018 having been a
record year in which prices were inflated by Section 232
import tariffs on steel. In 2019, prices fell due to weak real
demand and decreasing scrap prices. The average HRC
price for the third quarter was $627/t, a drop of $52/t versus
the previous quarter which was mainly due to the scrap USA
#1 Busheling price dropping by $33/t, to $290/t and
pressure from destocking at both Steel Service Centers
(“SSCs”) and Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”).

Prices in the fourth quarter of 2019 averaged at $579/t,
which is $48/t lower versus the third quarter. The situation
further deteriorated in October due to the strike at General
Motors that added to the market's negative sentiment. From
November onwards, some relief came as scrap started an
upward trend and international prices began to show signs
of recovery. As a result, the fourth quarter ended in
December at $623/t from the yearly low of $545/t, recorded
in October.

In China, spot HRC prices increased during the first quarter
of 2017, compared to the average levels of the fourth
quarter of 2016, fluctuating on an upward trend until the first
part of February 2017, but deteriorated afterwards, in line
with raw material basket cost decline. Domestic HRC prices
increased during the first quarter of 2017 by an average of
$35/t quarter-on-quarter. Prices then continued to slide,
hitting a bottom level of $374/t, VAT excluded by mid-May,
followed however by a rapid recovery to a $439/t, VAT
excluded average in June, supported by a new upward
trend in raw materials cost, positive market sentiment and
local mill interest to ramp up production and maximize
profits. HRC spot prices decreased in the second quarter of
2017 on average by $62/t quarter-on-quarter. In the first half

12 Management report

of 2017, HRC domestic prices in China averaged $427/t,
VAT excluded, compared to $317/t, VAT excluded, during
the first half of 2016. HRC spot prices in China continued
their steady increase in the beginning of September and
increased for the third quarter of 2017 by $113/t quarter-on-
quarter. The price increases slowed down during the fourth
quarter of 2017 with an increase of $29/t quarter-on-quarter.
HRC spot prices in China averaged $523/t, VAT excluded in
the second half of 2017, an increase of $138/t, VAT
excluded from the second half of 2016.

In China, spot HRC prices fluctuated during the first quarter
of 2018, peaking at $562/t VAT excluded at the end of
February, followed by a sharp decline due to weak demand
and high inventories. HRC prices bottomed out at the end of
March at $507/t VAT excluded. Production cuts in several
regions and mill inspections to ensure compliance with
pollution emission standards impacted supply during the
second quarter of 2018. These measures supported HRC
prices in China, which increased from $524/t VAT excluded
at the beginning of April to a high of $581/t VAT excluded by
mid-June. However, due to improvements in production
levels and seasonal weak demand, HRC prices declined at
the end of the month. In China, HRC domestic prices
averaged $555/t VAT excluded for the first half of 2018, as
compared to $427/t VAT excluded for the first half of 2017.

Despite the implementation of tough environmental controls
and positive fiscal policies to expand domestic demand,
production continued to increase, sustained by attractive
margins, while consumption remained flat during the second
half of 2018. This resulted in further pressure on HRC prices
in China, which declined by $15/t (during the third quarter of
2018) as compared to the second quarter average level to
$546/t VAT excluded and by an additional $58/t to $488/t
VAT excluded during the fourth quarter of 2018.

HRC domestic prices averaged $517/t VAT excluded for the
second half of 2018, representing a $7/t decline as
compared to $524/t VAT excluded for the second half of
2017.

In China, spot HRC prices averaged at $482/t VAT excluded
in the first quarter of 2019. The year started in January with
prices at $467/t, strengthening to $494/t by March, as a
result of the market's resumed activity following the Chinese
New Year.

In the second quarter of 2019, due to Brazil's

major accident at one of its largest iron ore mining facilities,
as well as due to the market seasonality, the peak prices
were reached in April at $523/t VAT excluded. The second
quarter of 2019 closed in at an average of $512/t VAT
excluded. Despite the governmental measures targeting
production cuts due to overcapacity and environmental
issues, domestic mills have reacted slowly to the
indications, driving the domestic price by end of June 2019
to $493/t VAT excluded, i.e. on a downward trajectory. The

HRC domestic price in China averaged $497/t VAT excluded
for the first half of 2019, compared to $557/t VAT excluded
for the first half of 2018.

The downward spiral of the Chinese HRC price continued in
the third quarter of 2019 reaching $474/t, which was $38/t
lower versus the previous quarter, with increased inventory
levels of both raw materials and finished products. Domestic
demand was impacted by seasonality. The fourth quarter of
2019 began with further weakening of Chinese HRC prices,
with October being the weakest month at an average of
$441/t. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) dropped to
its lowest point in four years, with the rate of new order
intake dropping by over 5% for both domestic and exports.
However, the market started to improve from November
onwards when the 7-month downward spiral reversed.
Better domestic demand and a decrease in finished product
inventory (-10% month-on-month) helped improve the prices
in November. In December, international steel prices started
to improve, which also supported a positive price
environment in China. The fourth quarter of 2019 ended at
$462/t, $12/t lower than in the third quarter. HRC spot prices
in China averaged $468/t, VAT excluded in the second half
of 2019, a decrease of $50/t, VAT excluded from the second
half of 2018.

Long products

Long steel product prices increased in Europe in the
beginning of the first quarter of 2017, followed by a decline
in mid-February, but with a recovery by the end of March.
Prices then weakened during the second quarter of 2017 for


--- Page 10 ---

both medium sections and rebars, but seemed to bottom out
by the end of June with a quarter on quarter decline of €15/t
and €22/t, respectively. The average price for medium
sections in Europe during the first half of 2017 was €508/t
compared to €481/t in the first half of 2016. The average
rebar price in Europe during the first half of 2017 was €452/t
compared to €404/t in the first half of 2016. Prices for long
steel products were on a steady upward trend toward the
end of the year. Medium sections prices increased €29/t
quarter-on-quarter, while rebar prices increased €28/t
quarter-on-quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2017,
medium sections prices further increased €58/t quarter-on-
quarter, while rebar prices increased €84/t quarter-on-
quarter. The average medium sections price in Europe for
the second half of 2017 was €557/t as compared to €499/t
for the second half of 2016. The average rebar price in
Europe for the second half of 2017 was €517/t as compared
to €432/t for the second half of 2016.

Long steel product prices remained relatively stable in
Europe in euro terms at the beginning of 2018 compared to
the peak level in December 2017, but continued their
upward trend in USD terms as the euro strengthened.
Prices weakened from mid-February and towards the end of
the first quarter of 2018 with inventories reaching
comfortable levels and a cautious market following the
volatility in raw material costs. Medium sections prices
declined from €625/t in January to €600/t by the end of
March. Similarly, rebar prices declined from €568/t in
January to €553/t in March. Prices remained stable again
during April 2018 but followed a downward trend until mid-
June when medium sections bottomed out at €585/t and
rebar at €528/t. Average medium sections prices were €603/
tin Europe for the first half of 2018 as compared to an
average of €508/t for the first half of 2017. Average rebar
prices were €552/t in Europe for the first half of 2018 as
compared to €452/t for the first half of 2017. Good market
sentiment and strong demand supported an improvement of
long product prices during the third quarter of 2018, with
medium sections reaching €620/t and rebars €560/t by
September corresponding to a €35/t and €32/t increase,
respectively, as compared to the bottom level in June, and
representing a quarter-on-quarter average improvement of
€20/t for medium sections and €6 for rebars. Prices
remained relatively stable during the fourth quarter of 2018
as compared to the levels at the end of September despite
some weakening in rebars with a quarterly average of €538/
trepresenting a €13/t decrease quarter-on-quarter. The
average medium sections prices were €618/t in Europe for
the second half of 2018 as compared to €557/t for the
second half of 2017. The average rebar prices were €545/t
in Europe for the second half of 2018 as compared to €517/t
for the second half of 2017.

Prices of long steel products in Europe continued their
steady downward trend in 2019. In January 2019, rebar
price and medium sections price reached €528/t and €624/t,

Management report 13

respectively. The rebar price decline started in August 2018,
while the medium sections price decline started in January
2019. By the end of March 2019, the rebar price and the
medium section price dropped to €526/t and €588/t,
respectively, reaching a quarterly average of €526/t and
€605/t, respectively. In June 2019, prices bottomed further
to €501/t for rebar and €579/t for medium sections. The
falling domestic pricing environment followed the trend of
weakening world scrap prices on international markets.

In Europe, the average medium sections price for the first
half of 2019 was €595/t as compared to an average of €603/
t for the first half of 2018. The average rebar price for the
first half of 2019 was €521/t as compared to €552/t for the
first half of 2018.

Prices for long steel products in Europe continued their
steady downward trend in the second half of 2019. The
prices reached a floor in November 2019 at €452/t for rebar
and €521/t for medium sections, the lowest over the last two
years. The average medium sections price in Europe for the
second half of 2019 was €548/t as compared to €619/t for
the second half of 2018, representing a drop of €71/t year-
on-year. The average rebar price in Europe for the second
half of 2019 was €476/t as compared to €545/t for the
second half of 2018, a decrease of €69/t year-on-year.

In the first quarter of 2017, imported scrap HMS 1&2 in
Turkey improved by $18/t compared to the fourth quarter of
2016 average of $275/t CFR. Rebar export prices closely
followed the evolution of Turkey imported Scrap HMS 1&2,
declining in the beginning of 2017 from $430/t FOB in
December 2016 to close to an average of $390/t FOB by
the end of January 2017, and continued fluctuating towards
the end of March 2017. However, Turkish rebar export
prices increased during the first quarter of 2017 by $14/t
quarter-on quarter. The price fluctuation continued during
the second quarter of 2017, but with an uptick towards the
end of June with an overall increase of $4/t over the
previous quarter. The average price in the first half of 2017
for rebar exported from Turkey was $425/t FOB compared
to $388/t FOB in the first half of 2016. From July through the
end of 2017, the Turkey rebar FOB price has been
fluctuating on an upward trend, closely following HMS 1&2
Turkey CFR price evolution. After hitting a three-year high of
$550/t FOB in the beginning of September 2017, rebar
prices declined to $508/t FOB by October. This drove an
increase in the average price range during the third quarter
of 2017 by $80/t quarter-on-quarter. Toward the end of
2017, the Turkey rebar FOB export price reached $570/t,
and further improved the quarterly average price by $20/t for
the fourth quarter of 2017. The average Turkey rebar export
price was $517/t FOB in the second half of 2017, an
increase of $123/t compared to $394/t FOB for the second
half of 2016.

In the first quarter of 2018, the price of imported scrap HMS
1&2 in Turkey improved by $40/t to an average level of


--- Page 11 ---

14 Management report

$363/t CFR as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Rebar export prices closely followed the evolution of Turkey
imported scrap HMS 1&2, declining from $573/t FOB at the
beginning of January to $555/t FOB by the end of the
month. Rebar export prices then increased to a peak of
$590/t FOB by the end of February followed by a downward
trend reaching $568/t FOB at the end of March. During the
second quarter of 2018, the Turkish export rebar price
continued to follow a downward trend alongside the scrap
HMS 1&2 index, ranging between $565/t FOB at the
beginning of April to $540/t FOB at the end of May. The
average Turkish export rebar price for the first half of 2018
was $562/t FOB, as compared to $425/t FOB for the first
half of 2017. With US and European markets blocked for
Turkish exporters due to EU safeguard measures and
doubling of the Section 232 import tariffs into the U.S.,
Turkish producers faced increased competition on
alternative markets resulting in further pressure on export
rebar prices during the first part of the third quarter. Prices
seemed to bottom out mid-August at $523/t; however they
continued to deteriorate during October to a $500/t level.
After a small uptick in November supported by an
improvement in scrap prices as well as a strengthening of
the Turkish Lira, Turkish export rebar prices dropped by the
end of the fourth quarter of 2018 to $455/t, the lowest level
since July 2017.

The average Turkish export rebar price for the second half
of 2018 was $507/t FOB, as compared to $518/t FOB for
the second half of 2017.

In Turkey, rebar export prices continue to align closely with
the evolution of world scrap prices. The first quarter of 2019
started for Turkish rebar at one of the lowest points
compared to the previous six quarters, being at $466/t FOB,
which is in line with the bottomed HMS 1&2 index at $310/t
CFR. However, the March 2019 rebar export price was
$482/t FOB, higher by $36/t compared to January at $446/t.
During the second quarter of 2019, the Turkish export rebar
price followed a month over month downward trend
alongside scrap HMS 1&2 index, from a high of $480/t FOB
at beginning of April down to $468/t FOB at the end of June.
Nevertheless, the average for the second quarter, at $473/t,
was higher than the average for the previous quarter at
$466/t. In the first half of 2019, the Turkish export rebar
price averaged $470/t FOB compared to $562/t FOB
average during the first half of 2018.

In the third quarter of 2019, the price of Turkish rebar
continued the downward trend from the previous quarter,
reaching $441/t FOB, which is a $32/t decrease quarter-on-
quarter. July opened the quarter at $461/t, while September
closed at $413/t, representing a drop of $48/t driven by the
seasonally limited demand. In October, prices reached a
floor for the year at $405/t, which was also the lowest point
over the last three years. The prices subsequently
increased with the overall fourth quarter of 2019 averaging
at $421/t. The year closed in December with a price of

$442/t, $37/t higher versus the low reached in October. The
increase in prices was driven by the U.S. scrap price
improvement from early November, which recovered the
$40/t lost in September/October and ended the year in
December at $290/t, although not enough to surpass the
level from the first half of the year at $348/t. The average
Turkish rebar export price for the second half of 2019 was
$431/t FOB as compared to $508/t FOB for the second half
of 2018.

Current and anticipated trends in steel production and
prices

The global economy clearly slowed in 2019, particularly in
Europe, and the lower global automotive production
weighed on steel demand. This impact was exacerbated by
supply chain destocking in all the major markets, particularly
in the Company’s core markets of NAFTA, Europe and
Brazil.

In China, in 2019, ArcelorMittal believes steel production
grew almost 3% (despite the 8.3% increase in official figures
- see discussion in "-Steel production" above) as demand
grew over 3%, while net exports declined by 6 million
tonnes. Before the onset of the coronavirus, the Company
expected production to grow in 2019 as domestic demand
increased by around 1 to 2%, coupled by marginally higher
exports as world ex-China demand grows. This may be
revised downward due to the impact of the Coronavirus on
Chinese demand and the knock-on impact elsewhere,
particularly the rest of Asia. The Chinese HRC spread
(difference between raw material costs and finished steel
prices) in 2017 increased from approximately $150/t in the
first half of 2017 to $250/t in the second half supported by
an elevated crude steel utilization rate mainly due to a
structural steel capacity cut and the winter heating season
policy, which temporarily restricted steel supply. Since then,


--- Page 12 ---

Chinese spreads have seen a sharp correction, declining
from $280/t in the third quarter of 2018 to approximately
$160/t in the third quarter of 2019. This was largely
impacted by the Chinese government lowering the focus on
reducing emissions and deleveraging and increasing the
focus on sustaining the economy. This led to both stronger
demand in 2019 (largely due to the stimulus plan targeting
infrastructure), and to more capacity (due to less effective
winter capacity constraints and some capacity creep). The
U.S.-China “phase one” trade deal led to improved market
sentiment, which resulted in industrial restocking. The
Chinese government also continued to ease liquidity
conditions moderately, as a tool to simulate the economy
supporting an improved HRC spread, reaching $190-200 by
the end of 2019 and sustained into January 2020. The
precise impact of the Coronavirus is unknown but has had a
negative impact on Chinese prices and spreads, and could
continue to have a negative impact if inventories continue to
rise at mills in China, putting downward pressure on pricing.
While the Company expects a significant negative impact on
industrial output and steel demand during the first quarter of
2020, assuming the disruption fades soon, employment and
incomes are expected to be relatively unaffected, with most
of the lost output expected to be recouped during the
remainder of 2020, supported by fiscal and monetary
easing. However, in 2020 both GDP and steel demand
growth are still likely to be weaker than what was expected
prior to the outbreak (Steel demand now expected to grow
only 0 to 1% in 2020, down from 1 to 2% previously
expected).

U.S. ASC decreased by almost -2% in 2019, as significant
destocking and declining auto output led flat products to
decline -4.7%, coupled with reduced pipe and tube
deliveries, this more than offset growth in long products.
Imports, however, continued to decline in 2019 (-18% year-
on-year) due to Section 232 25% tariffs on most non-NAFTA
countries, which allowed domestic production to increase
(+1.5% year-on-year). The Company anticipates a small (0
to 1%) further increase in steel demand in 2020, but with
imports expected to be broadly stable, steel production is
expected to grow at a similar rate to demand. In the EU,
steel demand declined by over 4%, driven by weaker real
demand and exacerbated by destocking, which accounted
for almost half the decline in apparent steel consumption.
Brazilian flat products demand was also negatively
impacted by destocking in 2019 and alongside continuing
growth in real demand, the Company expects growth in
apparent steel consumption of almost 5% in 2020. Despite
imports declining too, steel production in the EU still
declined by 4.9% in 2019. While real steel demand is
expected to remain weak in 2020, an end to destocking is
expected to support mild growth (around +1.5%) in ASC. In
2020, the Company expects continued pressure from
imports, which is why appropriate safeguard measures on
steel trade are important to enable European mills to benefit
from any improvement in demand.

Management report 15

Overall, ArcelorMittal expects world ex-China ASC to grow
again in 2020 due to relatively strong demand growth in
developing Asian markets and a rebound from significant
declines in Turkish steel demand, coupled by slow growth in
developed markets. Continued capacity restraint and
relatively stable production in China, together with continued
growth in demand in world ex-China is expected to lead to a
gradual improvement in utilization and support the spread of
steel prices over raw material costs. However, the
Coronavirus is having a significant impact on Chinese
demand during the first quarter of 2020 and is likely to have
a negative impact elsewhere, mainly Asia, through reduced
goods exports to China, fewer tourists from China and
supply-chain disruptions due to shortages of Chinese
produced intermediate goods. Although the impact on the
Company's core markets is expected to be smaller, until the
virus is under control, these cannot be quantified and our
current forecasts for steel demand assume that the situation
in China does not deteriorate materially. However, the
recent increase in cases outside China is worrying and
increases the risk of a global pandemic and a much larger
negative impact on global GDP. The Company is monitoring
the situation closely and in particular in Italy, as should the
virus spread more widely through Europe this will likely have
a material impact on the Company’s sales and profitability in
2020

Raw materials

The primary raw material inputs for a steelmaker are iron
ore, coking coal, solid fuels, metallics (e.g., scrap), alloys,
electricity, natural gas and base metals. ArcelorMittal is
exposed to price volatility in each of these raw materials
with respect to its purchases in the spot market and under
its long-term supply contracts. In the longer term, demand
for raw materials is expected to continue to correlate closely
with the steel market, with prices fluctuating according to
supply and demand dynamics. Since most of the minerals
used in the steel-making process are finite resources, their
prices may also rise in response to any perceived scarcity of
remaining accessible supplies, combined with the evolution
of the pipeline of new exploration projects to replace
depleted resources.

In 2017, the increase in the average reference iron ore and
hard coking coal price that occurred in 2016 continued due
to the impact of closures of induction furnaces capacity
since 2016. In 2017, iron ore and coking coal prices
increased by 22.3% and 31.5% year-on-year respectively
(Metal Bulletin 2017 vs. 2016). In the first quarter of 2018,
iron ore market reference prices increased following a
decrease in the fourth quarter of 2017, averaging $74.39/t,
up 13.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 (Metal
Bulletin 2018 vs. 2017), supported by robust crude steel
production in China. For the full year 2018, the strong steel
production in China amid its fight against air pollution and
overcapacity kept iron ore and coking coal prices at
elevated levels and boosted prices for high-grade qualities


--- Page 13 ---

16 Management report

as steel mills chased productivity. Though prices for the
most common qualities of iron ore decreased 2.2% year-on-
year in 2018, the high-grade qualities of iron ore posted a
price increase on an annual basis. Coking coal prices
increased 10.3% compared to 2017 (Metal Bulletin 2018 vs.
2017).

In 2019, iron ore market reference prices increased
following a supply disruption caused by the collapse of the
Brumadinho dam owned by Vale in Brazil on January 25,
2019 and the cyclone in Australia mining region (end of
March 2019), averaging $93.63/t, up 34% compared to
2018 (Metal Bulletin 2019 vs. 2018).

Coking coal prices in 2018 averaged $206.58/t (compared
to $187.31/t in 2017) and were supported by robust crude
steel production in China as well as bullish market
sentiment from risk of lower Australian supply due to the
announcement of changes in the maintenance schedule by
the main local rail network operator. Coking coal prices in
2019 averaged $177.36/t (compared to $206.58/t in 2018)
and were initially supported by incidents in Australia (heavy
rains, accident at Anglo’s Moranbah mine) and the local
Australian rail network operator trade union’s industrial
action and maintenance works, however, in the second half
of 2019, the prices decreased, driven by coking coal import
restrictions at key Chinese ports and a weak demand from
India amid domestic slowdown.

As for pricing mechanisms, since 2012, quarterly and
monthly pricing systems have been the main type of
contract pricing mechanisms, but spot purchases also
appear to have gained a greater share as steelmakers have
developed strategies to benefit from increasing spot market
liquidity and volatility. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the trend for
using shorter-term pricing cycles continued. Pricing is
generally linked to market price indexes and uses a variety
of mechanisms, including current spot prices and average
prices over specified periods. Therefore, there may not be a
direct correlation between market reference prices and
actual selling prices in various regions at a given time.

Iron ore

Iron ore prices recovered to $85.60/t in the first quarter of
2017 following strong demand for steel after the Chinese
New Year. The average price for the second quarter of 2017
decreased to $62.90/t; this downward trend was influenced
by increased inventory levels at Chinese ports. In the third
quarter of 2017, the average price increased to $71.20/t
driven by bullish sentiment in the steel market reflected in
strong steel PMIs (Purchasing Manager Index) for China.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the price varied from a
minimum of $58.52/t on October 31, 2017 and a maximum
of $76.36/t on December 22, 2017, with the average for the
fourth quarter at $65.50/t. The quarter was marked by high
volatility driven by environmental regulation announcements

by the Chinese authorities to constrain emissions and steel
production during the 2017-2018 winter period.

In the first quarter of 2018 iron ore prices recovered at
$74.39/t, up 13.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
However, great price disparities were observed. Seaborne
iron ore demand was hit by a persistent weakness in
downstream steel demand, the trade war developing
between China and the U.S. and the extension of winter
restrictions in China beyond March 15, 2018 all of which
had a significant impact. In March, prices plummeted from
the highest quarter price of $79.39/t in the beginning of the
month to $64.99/t at the end of the month (Metal Bulletin
2017 & 2018). In the second quarter of 2018, prices
decreased and remained stable at an average $65.30/t
despite strong steel demand over the period. China iron ore
port stocks remained high and concentrate production
sharply decreased year-over-year as a result of mine
inspections. However, steel PMI remained in expansion at
51.6 points in June. In the third quarter, prices were fairly
stable, averaging $66.8/t. Low prices on the seaborne
market found support in the fear of an intensification of the
trade war between China and the U.S., depreciation of the
Chinese currency, low future prices and environmental
restriction in China. The last quarter of 2018 saw the iron
ore price jumping and averaging $71.6/t. It reached $76.75/t
on November 12, 2018 amid strong steel margins depleting
stocks at Chinese ports and restocking demand in China
before the start of the winter period. Also, the derailment of
a BHP train carrying iron ore in Australia in the beginning of
November provided some short-term support to the iron ore
price that boosted the November average. However, prices
dropped at the end of November, and in the beginning of
December, mills corrected for weak off-season demand and
reduced steel margins due to less stringent winter
restrictions, which led to prices at the end of 2018 at $72.70/
t

In the first quarter of 2019, following the Vale owned
Brumadinho dam disaster in Brazil, the seaborne iron ore
market surged to $82.41/t on average, up 15% compared to
the last quarter of 2018. The supply shock was aggravated
by the cyclone season in Australia with some Australian iron
ore producers lowering their output guidance for the year,
which contributed to reaching $100.92/t on average in the
second quarter of 2019 with a peak of $125.77/t observed
on July 2 (Metal Bulletin) also supported by lower
inventories at Chinese ports. Prices remained elevated in
July at $119.93/t in average and sharply decreased in
August to $90.69/t following expectations of weaker demand
as well as the impact of currency risks which were
exacerbated by the decision of China’s central bank to
depreciate the yuan in response to decision of the U.S.
government to extend punitive tariffs, both of which cast
uncertainty on the iron ore future market, along with supply
recovery. In September 2019, iron ore prices rose again on
the back of a supportive paper market and expectations of


--- Page 14 ---

increased end-user restocking activity. The average price for
the third quarter of 2019 was $102.03/t. October 2019 was
bearish with continued lack of end-user demand for iron ore
fines ahead of announcements for winter production cuts.
However, prices recovered sharply in November amid
higher end-user demand for high-grade materials and
supportive futures market for steel. The fourth quarter of
2019 average price was $88.97/t and the average price for
2019 was $93.63/t (Metal Bulletin).

Coking coal

In the first quarter of 2017, the spot prices (Metal Bulletin
Premium Hard Coking Coal FOB Australia index "HCC
FOB") sharply dropped from $266.50/t in December 2016
(monthly average) to $155.20/t in March 2017 (monthly
average) with the average spot price for the first quarter at
$166.80/t. The temporary relief of the Chinese working days
restriction and fully recovered supply from Australia, as well
as expected additional seaborne supply from North America
allowed such a sharp drop in prices by the end of the first
quarter of 2017. At the beginning of the second quarter of
2017, the cyclone Debbie that unexpectedly hit Australia
caused supply disruptions and spot prices spiked. The
upward trend of April up to $300/t on April 18, 2017 and a
monthly average of $257.80/t was followed by the
downward trend in May and June as the Australia mining-
rail-port system recovered earlier than expected from the
cyclone disruption. The spot price decreased through the
second quarter to $175/t in May (monthly average) and
$145/t in June 2017 (monthly average), leading to an
average spot price for the second quarter of 2017 of
$190.60/t.

For the second quarter of 2017, a new index-based
methodology was adopted for the premium HCC FOB
Australia quarterly contract price between some Japanese
steel makers and Australian HCC suppliers. In the third
quarter of 2017, the average spot price (Metal Bulletin
Premium HCC FOB Australia index) increased to $188.30/t
driven by bullish sentiment in the steel market and strong
steel PMIs for China. In the fourth quarter, supported by the
port congestion in Australia, the price further increased to
$203.50/t.

Coking coal prices entered 2018 as a bullish market with
record high vessel queues at a key port in Queensland,
Australia and Chinese restocking demand high ahead of the
Chinese New Year holiday. The spot prices (Metal Bulletin
Premium HCC FOB Australia index) averaged $228.48/t in
the first quarter of 2018 increasing 36.8% year-on-year and
12.2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The
elevated prices were then corrected in the second quarter
and reached $188.89/t (quarterly average) due to the
extension of Chinese winter restrictions until April and
delayed increase of steel demand in China. However, the
downward movement was limited by a continued threat of
supply disruptions due to Aurizon’s announced change in

Management report 17

the maintenance plan at its rail system in Australia, and
safety check at Chinese mines. The price also found
support from Chinese coke prices as domestic coke
producers faced environmental crackdowns. In the third
quarter, coking coal prices averaged $184/t and $183/t in
July and August respectively with no major supply disruption
and less demand during Indian monsoon season. The
prices rose again in September to $198/t with demand from
strong steel production in China amid healthy margins and
tight supply of low-Sulphur coking coal in the Chinese
domestic market. Prices kept on increasing in the last
quarter on the back of strong steel production and threat of
supply issues from scheduled maintenance at key
Australian ports which increased port queues again to the
record levels seen at the end of 2017. The bullish sentiment
found support from the breakout of a fire at one Australian
mine, rendering it idle for at least six months. The coking
coal spot prices increased to a quarterly average of
$220.79/t in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In the first quarter of 2019, coking coal prices were volatile
ranging from $190/t to $217/t. The volatility was supported
by incidents in Australia, including heavy rains, an accident
at Anglo’s Moranbah mine and a trade union's industrial
action at a local rail network operator. The average spot
price in the first quarter of 2019 was $206.33/t (Metal
Bulletin Premium HCC FOB Australia index). In the second
quarter of 2019, prices first increased to the quarter’s high
of $213.16/t on May 13, 2019 fueled by the increased
sentiment of potential less availability of metallurgical coal
railroad capacity in Australia due to maintenance at a local
rail network operator in April. Prices then decreased to
$191.61/t on June 28, 2019 due to reduced steel margins
putting pressure on coke prices. The average spot price in
the second quarter of 2019 was $202.85/t. In the third
quarter of 2019, tightening of coking coal import restrictions
at key Chinese ports and weak demand from India during
the monsoon season led to a decrease in prices with the
average spot price at $161.03/t (Metal Bulletin Premium
HCC FOB Australia index). In the fourth quarter of 2019, the
bearish trend in the coking coal market continued driven by
a slowdown in Chinese imports including a ban on imports
at China’s largest coking coal handling port in Jingtang
effective from October 1, 2019. Weak demand from India
post the monsoon season amid domestic slowdown
contributed to this bearish trend. The average coking coal
spot price decreased to $139.27/t in the fourth quarter of
2019.

ArcelorMittal has continued to leverage its iron ore and
coking coal supply chain and diversified supply portfolio as
well as the flexibility provided by contractual terms to
mitigate regional supply disruptions and also mitigate part of
the market price volatility.

Scrap

The Company considers the German suppliers’ index
("“BDSV”) Delivered at Place (“DAP”) as market reference.

During 2019, the BDSV for reference grade E3 started in
January at €262/t and reached a maximum for the period of
€278/t in March. From April on it decreased month by month
until reaching the bottom in October at €196/t € followed by
two consecutive increases in November and December to
€244/t. The average index for 2019 was €252/t as
compared to €285/t for 2018 and €259/t for 2017, a
decrease of €33 or 12% less than 2018.

Turkey’s scrap imports declined by 11% in the first nine
months of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018,
nevertheless it remains by far the main scrap buying country
in the international market. Turkish Electric Arc Furnace
steel production share dropped from 69% in 2018 to 68% in
the first 9 months of 2019 and total crude steel production
was down by 10.1% in the same period. The Scrap Index
HMS 1&2 CFR Turkey, North Europe origin, started January
2019 at $280/t reaching a maximum for the year in March at
$317/t and then dropped during the second quarter to $286/
tin June. It then reached a peak in July at $288/t followed
by a continuous decrease until October to $233/t and then
increasing again to reach $290/t in December. The average
yearly prices were $294/t in 2017, $334/t in 2018 and $281/t
in 2019. The average European scrap prices were
consistent with the exports HMS 1&2 CFR Turkey, North
Europe reference for 2019.

In the domestic U.S. market, HMS 1 delivered Midwest
index was $75/t lower in 2019 than 2018. The Midwest
Index for HMS 1 decreased from an average of $322/t for
2018 to $247/t for 2019. On the export market, HMS export

FOB New York average prices of 2019 were at $266/t, a
decrease by $54/t compared to 2018 ($280/t in 2017).

Ferro alloys and base metals
Ferro alloys

The underlying price driver for manganese alloys is the
price of manganese ore which was at the level of $5.63 per
dry metric tonne unit (“dmt”) (for 44% lump ore) on Cost,
Insurance and Freight (“CIF”) China for 2019, representing
a 21% decrease from $7.16/dmt in 2018 ($5.97/dmt in
2017) mainly due to overstocking of material at Chinese
ports reflecting low appetite from manganese alloy
producers as a result of low steel demand.

Manganese alloys prices also followed a downward trend
where high carbon ferro manganese decreased by 10%
from $1,330/t in 2018 to $1,203/t in 2019 ($1,428/t in 2017),
silicon manganese decreased by 7% from $1,325/t in 2018
to $1,234/t in 2019 ($1,343/t in 2017) and medium carbon
ferro manganese decreased by 8% from $1,930/t in 2018 to
$1,780/t in 2019 ($1,910/t in 2017).

Base metals

Base metals used by ArcelorMittal are zinc, tin and
aluminum for coating, aluminum for deoxidization of liquid
steel and nickel for producing stainless or special steels.
ArcelorMittal partially hedges its exposure to its base metal
inputs in accordance with its risk management policies.

The average price of zinc for 2019 was $2,549/t,
representing a 13% decrease as compared to the 2018
average of $2,926/t (the 2017 average was $2,896/t).
Stocks registered at the London Metal Exchange (“LME”)
warehouses stood at 51,225 tonnes as of December 31,
2019, representing a 60% decrease compared to December
31, 2018 when registered stocks stood at 129,325 tonnes
(182,050 tonnes in 2017).

The average price of tin for 2019 was $18,671/t, 7% lower
than the 2018 average of $20,167/t (2017 average was
$20,098/t).

The average price of aluminum for 2019 was $1,792/t,
representing a 15% decrease compared to the 2018
average of $2,110/t (the 2017 average was $1,968/t).

The average price of nickel for 2019 was $13,936/t,
representing a 6% increase compared to the 2018 average
of $13,118/t (the 2017 average was $10,407/t).

Energy market

Solid fuels, electricity and natural gas are some of the
primary raw material inputs for a steelmaker. ArcelorMittal is
exposed to price volatility in each of these raw materials
with respect to its purchases in the spot market and under
its long-term supply contracts.

Oil

In the first quarter of 2016, after decreasing for six quarters
in a row, the Brent crude oil price leveled at just below $30/
barrel (“bbl”). To boost prices, a group of producers led by
OPEC (the "Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries") and Russia agreed at the end of 2016 to cut
production by 1.8 million barrels per day (“bpd”). Initially, the
cuts were expected to last for only six months. However, an
extension in May 2017 and again in November the same
year launched an era in which production cuts became a
popular tool among producers to support global oil prices.
As a consequence, prices increased starting in the summer
of 2017 when prices gained 75% year-on-year from $45/bbl
in May 2017 to $80/bbI in May 2018, with prices continuing
to steadily increase throughout the first three quarters of
2018. The Brent crude oil front month contract started 2018
at $66/bbI and peaked at $86/bbI (a 4-year high) in October
2018. During the same period, the U.S. pulled out of the
Iran nuclear deal, and was threatening sanctions against
any country which further imported Iranian oil. In the
following months, Brent crude oil fell more than 30% and
finished the year at $53.80/bbl, a 15-month low. The drop
was backed by growing concerns of a global economic
slowdown as a tariff war between the world's biggest
economies (namely, the U.S. and China) intensified. To stop
plummeting prices, a final effort from OPEC and its allies
was made in early December 2018, when they jointly
decided to cut output by 1.2 million bpd throughout the first
half of 2019. Immediately, the oil market started tightening
throughout the first quarter of 2019, finishing the first half of
the year just higher than $65/bbl. The driving forces of 2019
proved to be the same as in 2018. While tensions grew in
the Middle East fueled by renewed sanctions on Iran, the
U.S. continued to pump oil at record high levels. The U.S.
and China continued its trade war and the UK continued to
postpone Brexit. At the start of the third quarter of 2019,
OPEC and Russia confirmed that they would continue their
efforts to balance the global market by extending the 1.2
million bpd cut by another nine months and into the first
quarter of 2020. In December 2019, a decision was made to
increase the level of cuts in the first quarter of 2020 but not
to extend these cuts beyond March 2020. In the meantime,
Iran's retaliation threats kept the oil markets on alert.
Throughout 2019, Brent crude oil moved between $55/bbl
and $75/bbl, not exposing a clear trend, not even after
supply shocks like the bombing of a Saudi facility in
September. Brent crude oil finished the year in the middle of
the range at $66/bbI.

co2

The integrated steel process involves carbon and COz,
which distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini-
mills and many other industries where COz2 generation is
primarily linked to energy use. Launched in 2005, the
European Union Emission Trading System (“EU-ETS”) is
currently in its third phase, stretching from 2013 to
December 2020 and the trading system for the period after
2020 has been revised in a manner that may require
ArcelorMittal to incur additional costs to acquire emissions
allowances. The EU-ETS is based on a cap-and-trade
principle; it sets a cap on greenhouse gas emissions
(“GHG”) from covered installations, which is then reduced
year after year. Since 2009, a surplus of emission
allowances has built up in the EU-ETS, keeping prices
below €10 per ton of COz equivalent (“€/tCO2e”) until 2018.
In 2016 and 2017, the price for a European Union
Allowance (“EUA”) - which gives the holder the right to emit
one ton of carbon dioxide (“CO.”) - ranged between €4/
tCO2e and €6/tCO2e.

To boost the EUA price and to provide an incentive to the
industry and the power sector to alter their behavior in terms
of COz emissions, in July 2015 the European Commission
proposed a reform of the EU-ETS for the period 2021-2030
(phase 4). More than 2 years later, inter-institutional
negotiations were concluded presenting solutions to reduce
the current surplus. Consequently, in November 2017 the
EUA price crossed the €8/tCO2e mark for the first time
since January 2016. With the EU Council's final approval in


--- Page 17 ---

20 Management report

February 2018, the ETS reform became law (Directive (EU)
2018/410). As a result, the EUA price surged further and
only leveled after surpassing the historical high of €25/
tCO2e in September 2018. This marked a 360% price
increase in only nine months. At the end of 2018, the price
reached an all-time high of €25.3/tCO2e amid thin trading
activity during the holiday period. Throughout the first half of
2019 the EUA price increased by 15% and finished the
second quarter of 2019 at €26.5/tCO2e. Not only did the
EUA price increase but the market also witnessed great
volatility mainly driven by uncertainties around Brexit, the
end of the compliance period in April and the market stability
reserve (“MSR”) which started operating in January 2019,
reducing auction supplies since the second week of
January. A new historical high was reached in July 2019,
when the price for a EUA touched €30/tCO2e. However,
more generally, during the first quarter of 2019, prices
remained around €22/tCO2e while prices remained around
€25/tCO2e for the rest of 2019. See "Risks related to the
global economy and the mining and steel industry". Laws
and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases
could force ArcelorMittal to incur increased capital and
operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on
ArcelorMittal's results of operations and financial condition.

Thermal coal

The 2017/2018 winter began with a Chinese campaign
aimed at switching millions of households from using coal to
natural gas for heating purposes. At the same time, the
country tightened imports by banning small ports from
receiving foreign coal cargoes. The campaign unexpectedly
boosted demand from coal-fired power plants as it created a
shortage of natural gas. The tightening of the Asian market
had some severe spill-overs to the European market and
pushed the spot price for all publications index number 2
(“API2”) - which reflects the price for imports into ARA
(Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp) - above $90/t, a level not
seen since the end of 2012. Throughout the first quarter of
2018, the API2 shed almost 20% as the global supply
demand balance softened amid the Chinese New Year
holiday. After increasing throughout the second quarter of
2018, the API2 reached a new 6-year high when it
surpassed the $100/t mark in the third quarter. This was
triggered by utilities replenishing stocks and strong demand
from power stations due to a hot and dry summer. In the
fourth quarter of 2018, prices remained volatile but
decreased almost 20% amid China's imposition of new
import restrictions, and Europe benefiting from a mild start
to the winter. During the first half of 2019, the downward
trend continued and the spot contract for API2 lost more
than 40%, finishing the second quarter of 2019 at a 3 year
low of just below $50/t. This sharp price decrease was
driven by coal-to-gas switching across the European power
sector and an abundance of supply, since Australia had to
redirect its cargoes due to Chinese import restrictions.
During the third quarter of 2019, short term prices

rebounded amid higher spot demand and stock replenishing
activity ahead of the winter. However, a milder than average
winter led to a price decrease of almost 20% during the
fourth quarter of 2019, from around $64/t in September to
$52/t end of December.

Natural gas - Europe

Year after year, the natural gas market moves toward
becoming a global commodity due to the continuous
development of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”), driven by the
construction of new liquefaction units (called trains) in
Russia, Australia and in the U.S. The worldwide LNG
exports reached 485 billion cubic meters (“bcm”) in 2019, an
increase of 11.5% compared to 2017. Consequently, natural
gas is increasingly exposed to the same commodity super-
cycles that also affect thermal coal and crude oil, for
example. Unlike thermal coal and crude oil, the European
natural gas market is showing stronger seasonal patterns.

Despite starting 2018 at the same price level as 2017, the
2018 TTF Spot Price (the price for natural gas to be
delivered the next day, which is traded on a virtual trading
platform located in the Netherlands) averaged €22.85 per
Megawatt hour (“€/MWh’”), which is more than 30% higher
than the 2017 average (€17.32/MWh). The year 2018
started with milder than normal weather but a late cold snap
at the end of February brought freezing temperatures from
Siberia to Europe. Combined with limited storage flexibility
and supply problems across Europe, spot prices at major
European hubs skyrocketed to multi-year highs. In the
aftermath, northwest European natural gas storage levels
dropped well below the 5-year average. Efforts to refill
storages, together with strong summer demand from natural
gas fired power plants, exceptionally high LNG prices and
an overall rising energy complex kept supporting European
natural gas prices up until the start of the fourth quarter of
2018 (an increase of 50% throughout the first nine months
of the year). During the last quarter of 2018, the TTF spot
price tumbled from €29.50/MWh down to €22.00/MWh. This
trend continued into 2019, and the TTF spot price
plummeted below the €10.00/MWh mark by end of June.
This sharp decrease of 55% from the beginning of first
quarter to the end of second quarter happened on the back
of milder than normal seasonal temperatures, rapidly
improving storage levels, historical high LNG arrivals and a
continuous strong import of Norwegian and Russian piped
gas. Even high levels of coal-to-gas switching across the
European power sector could not prevent prices from
dropping to historical lows by the end of June. Throughout
the third quarter of 2019, TTF spot prices traded in average
at €10.2/MWh (year-on-year decrease of 58%), with a low in
September close to €7/MWh. In November, TTF spot prices
traded up and reached levels of around €16.6/MWh. This.
price increase was supported by colder temperatures and
the fear that Russia and Ukraine would not be able to sign a
new multi-year transit contract. It was only in the very last
days of December that the two countries agreed on a deal


--- Page 18 ---

leading to a price collapse during the second half of
December, and the front month delivery finished the year at
€11.7/MWh.

Natural gas - United States

In 2019, natural gas production in the U.S. reached another
record. Total production grew by 8.3 billion cubic feet per
day ("bcf/d") in 2019 year-over-year, with associated gas
contributing to more than half (4.5 bcf/d) of the increase.
Gas markets across the U.S. remain oversupplied and
continuously pressured Henry Hub gas prices lower in
search of a new floor. Consequently, low gas prices in 2019
led to another record year for gas-for-power demand at 31
bef/d, growing 2 bef/d from the previous year. Furthermore,
2019 was also a record year for LNG development in the
number of final investment decisions reached ("FIDs") and
LNG train start-ups. More than 30 Million Metric Tonnes per
Annum ("mmpta") of capacity became available following
the FIDs reached in 2019, the single largest year in U.S.
LNG history. In 2019, the U.S. exported a total of 37.6
mmpta of LNG, which marks an increase of 66% year-on-
year.

In North America, natural gas prices trade independently of
oil prices and are set by spot and future contracts, traded on
the NYMEX exchange or over-the-counter. In the first nine
months of 2018, the Henry Hub front month price (the price
for gas traded on a U.S. virtual trading platform, for delivery
in the next calendar month) averaged $2.85 per million
British Thermal Units ("/MMBtu"), a 6.5% decrease
compared to the first nine months of 2017. The recession in
natural gas prices that held from the beginning of 2015 until
September 2018 changed in the first two weeks of
November 2018, as weather-related natural gas demand
increased sharply, and the relatively low levels of natural
gas in storage could not provide the needed flexibility
leading to a 60% price increase in only 10 days. In mid-
November 2018, the front-month Henry Hub natural gas
futures hit a price of $4.8/MMBtu, the highest price since the
second quarter of 2014. Consequently, at the end of
November, natural gas inventories stood 19% lower than
the previous five-year average forcing the Henry Hub Month
Ahead price to average $4.0/MMBtu throughout November
and December 2018. Henry Hub natural gas futures lost
more than 20% throughout the first half of 2019 and at the
end of June stood more than 50% lower than the winter
peak in the fourth quarter of 2018. U.S. dry gas production
during the first quarter of 2019 was almost 13% higher than
in the same period a year earlier. This led to a faster than
normal rise of working stocks in underground storage,
resulting in downward pressure of the natural gas market.
This downward pressure persisted throughout the second
half of 2019, with only occasional spikes up to $2.7/MMBtu
in September and $2.9/MMBtu in November. Nevertheless,
the fourth quarter of 2019 averaged $2.4/MMBtu (down 35%
from the fourth quarter of 2018).

Management report 21

Natural gas - Asia

Throughout the first quarter of 2018, the Platts Japan Korea
Marker ("JKM") - the LNG benchmark price assessment for
spot physical cargoes delivered ex-ship into Japan, South
Korea, China and Taiwan - front month contract prices
dropped 35% (equivalent to $4/MMBtu) and bottomed at
$7.2/MMBtu before entering a period of increasing prices.
While prices normally would have relaxed on the back of
muted demand from Asian consumers at the end of June
2018, the front month contract price again surpassed the
$11/MMBtu level ($6/MMBtu higher year-on-year). However,
in 2018 strong Asian restocking demand ahead of the winter
met strong cooling needs. At the end of the first quarter of
2018, the price spread between the Pacific and the Atlantic
basin dropped below $1/MMBtu erasing the arbitrage
window and allowing LNG cargoes to sail to Europe. This
spread quickly increased to $3.7/MMBtu dragging cargoes
away from Europe. After a period of high volatility, the
spread stabilized around $2.0/MMBtu by the end of the third
quarter and into the fourth quarter of 2018, fueled by
lackluster Asian demand. At the same time, charter rates for
LNG vessels exploded and moved north of $160,000/day (a
long way from the lows of 2016 and 2017 when spot rates
were hovering at $25,000/day). This led to trapped LNG
supply in the Atlantic basin leading to sharply dropping
European natural gas prices. During the first half of 2019,
European importers saw record high levels of LNG arrivals,
reflecting the abundant supply across Asia amid healthy
storage levels in key importing countries as a result of a
mild winter. Furthermore, a significant ramp-up of new
liquefaction capacity across Australia, the U.S. and Russia
meant more supply to an already oversupplied market.
Consequently, the JKM front month contract lost 47% from
the start of the year until the end of June 2019. With muted
demand and more global supply, the low prices persisted
until the end of the second quarter of 2019. In the fourth
quarter of 2019, amid the start of the winter, the JKM rose
and averaged $5.9/MMBtu (42% lower than 2018).

Electricity - Europe

Due to the regional nature of electricity markets, prices
follow mainly local drivers (i.e. energy mix of the respective
country, power generation from renewables, country specific
energy policies, etc.). However, unlike previous years, 2018
marked a structural change with the emergence of the CO2
price as one of the major price drivers. The forward
baseload power contract for the front calendar year (delivery
2019) strongly increased in all European market places
throughout the year (e.g. from €40.5 to €59.1/MWh in
Belgium (an increase of 46% year-to-date), from €41.75 to
€58.45/MWh in France (an increase of 40% year-to-date)
and from €36.7 to €52.7/MWh in Germany (an increase of
44% year-to-date)). The 2018 price increase was mainly
due to the overall fuel price increases, the unreliability of an
aging French and Belgian nuclear fleet and a weak year in
terms of renewable output, a trend which reversed in the
first half of 2019. Tumbling fuel prices, combined with
healthy renewable power generation and strong nuclear
output helped to pressure spot prices across North West
Europe in the first half of 2019. The lack of a severe
summer heatwave helped to pressure the third quarter of
2019 prices. Wet early winter months, mild temperatures
and good renewable power output contributed to a
significant reduction in France and Belgium the fourth
quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease occurred
despite the fact that French nuclear availability was at a
multi-year low for that time of the year, which is normally a
strong support for prices.

The following table shows quarterly average spot prices of
electricity in Germany, France and Belgium for the past
three years:

Ocean freight

Ocean freight prices (average for all sizes) remained at the
same level in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the increase
on cape size offset by the decrease on Panamax,
Supramax and Handymax segments. The Baltic Dry Index
(“BDI”) maintained the same average at 1,352 points in
2019 compared to 2018 (1,145 points in 2017). The
Capesize index increased by 9% year-on-year to average
$18,025/day against $16,529/day in 2018 ($15,129/day in
2017). Meanwhile the Panamax index increased by 9% to
an average of $11,112/day as compared to $11,654/day in
2018 ($9,766/day in 2017). In 2019, on the cape size a total
of 79 vessels or 18.8 million deadweight was delivered, the
most since 2016 and up from 52 vessels or 14.4 million
deadweight in 2018. Panamax in 2019 was heavy in terms
of deliveries with 134 vessels or 11.1 million deadweight
delivered, the most since 2014 and up from 67 units or 5.5
million deadweight in 2018.

Fleet growth remained moderate but picked up slightly by
4.1% in deadweight terms in 2019 (2.6% increase
compared to 2018) following increased deliveries and
limited demolition activity. Deliveries up 22% y-o-y to 98.4
million deadweight, scrapping down 45% year-over-year to
17.0 million deadweight. Part of the impact of this fleet
growth was offset by scrubber retrofitting activity (at year
end, 35 million deadweight was in repair yards undergoing a
retrofit) and slower speeds. The high fleet growth in 2019
(4.1%) is expected to continue in 2020 when the fleet is also
expected to grow more than demand. The cumulative
impact of these growth rates means that the gap between
demand for shipping and the supply of ships is expected to
continue to put downward pressure on freight rates
throughout the year.

Impact of exchange rate movements

Because a substantial portion of ArcelorMittal’s assets,
liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar (its reporting currency),
ArcelorMittal has exposure to fluctuations in the values of
these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. These currency
fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro, as well as fluctuations in the currencies
of the other countries in which ArcelorMittal has significant
operations and sales, can have a material impact on its
results of operations. For example, ArcelorMittal’s non-U.S.
subsidiaries may purchase raw materials, including iron ore
and coking coal, in U.S. dollars, but may sell finished steel
products in other currencies. Consequently, an appreciation
of the U.S. dollar will increase the cost of raw materials;
thereby having a negative impact on the Company's
operating margins, unless the Company is able to pass
along the higher cost in the form of higher selling prices. In
order to minimize its currency exposure, ArcelorMittal enters
into hedging transactions to lock-in a set exchange rate, as
per its risk management policies.

In 2017, the fluctuations on the foreign exchange markets
were broadly driven by the activity of central banks that
started to reduce their accommodative monetary policies,
including the U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Federal Reserve"),
which increased rates three times during the year. The less
accommodative policies adopted by the European Central
Bank (“ECB”), Bank of Canada (“BoC”) and Bank of
England (“BoE”) were already anticipated by the markets
and their respective currencies strengthened even before
the banks’ monetary decisions. The euro strengthened
significantly against the U.S. dollar, from 1.0541 at the
beginning of 2017 to 1.1993 at the end of the year.

Since April 1, 2018, the Company has designated a portfolio
of euro denominated debt (€6.9 billion as of December 31,
2019) as a hedge of certain euro denominated investments
(€8.1 billion as of December 31, 2019) in order to mitigate
the foreign currency risk arising from certain euro
denominated subsidiaries net assets. The risk arises from
the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between EUR/USD,
which causes the amount of the net investments to vary.
See also note 6.3 to the consolidated financial statements.
As a result of the hedge designation, foreign exchange
gains and losses related to the portfolio of euro
denominated debt are recognized in other comprehensive
income.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company is mainly subject to
foreign exchange exposure relating to the euro, Brazilian
real, Canadian dollar, Indian rupee, Kazakhstani tenge,
South African rand, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Argentine
peso and Ukrainian hryvnia against the U.S. dollar resulting
from its trade payables and receivables.

Management report 23

In 2019, the euro decreased from 1.1450 at December 31,
2018 to 1.0889 at end of the third quarter, before gradually
increasing back to 1.1234 on December 31, 2019 against
the U.S. dollar as a result of a global context driven by the
U.S. administration's protectionism on trade policies and
progressive narrowing of U.S. dollar and euro rate
differentials as the U.S. Federal Reserve ("FED") delivered
three rates cuts in the second half of 2019 thus lowering
FED Funds target rate to 1.55%.

The Polish zloty marginally decreased against the U.S.
dollar throughout 2019 from 3.7567 on December 31, 2018
to 3.7892 on December 31, 2019 after reaching 4.0208 at
the end of the third quarter. Although Polish economic
performance remained strong for the period, the zloty’s
behavior for the period mainly resulted from the persistently
accommodative stance from the Polish Central Bank even
with local inflation finally beating the 2.5% official target on
the second semester.

The Ukrainian hryvinia increased gradually against the U.S.
dollar in 2019 starting from 27.6886 on December 31, 2018
to 23.6860 on December 31, 2019 reflecting the positive
news around the local economic potential following the
election of the new president Volodymyr Zelensky and
benefiting from improvements in the country’s relations with
Russia as well as optimistic view on key structural reforms.

The Kazakh tenge was stable at 384.17 against the U.S.
dollar at the beginning of the year, depreciated to 390.39 on
October 9, 2019 and then appreciated to 381.24 as of
December 31, 2019. This fluctuation was due to the
National Bank raising its base rate in order to contain rising
inflationary pressures from the ongoing recovery of
consumer demand and a 4.2% stronger than expected
economic growth.

The Indian rupee decreased against the U.S. dollar in 2019
from 69.6330 at the beginning of the year to 71.3776 on
December 31, 2019 resulting mainly from extremely
accommodative monetary measures taken by the National
Bank of India in its attempt to support India's slowing
economy notably affected by the deteriorating trade context
globally as well as through weak household demand locally,
slower credit disbursements by banks and non-bank
financial companies, policy disruptions, a sluggish
investment cycle and structural issues. In October 2018, the
Company entered into hedging programs including non-
deliverable forwards and non-deliverable options for a total
nominal amount of $5.9 billion in order to hedge the volatility
between the Indian Rupee and U.S. dollar in relation to the
proposed acquisition of AMNS India. In 2019, $5.1 billion of
the hedging program settled generating a gain of $360
million. As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of the
hedging program remained at $0.8 billion. See note 6.3 to
the consolidated financial statements for further information.

24 Management report

The South African rand concluded 2019 slightly appreciating
against the U.S. dollar after having decreased from 14.4306
on December 31, 2018 to 15.4190 in August 2019 and
finally appreciating to 14.1183 on December 31, 2019 and
thus not reflecting significantly the fact that signs of
improvement from the South African economy remain quite
weak.

The Canadian dollar appreciated against the U.S. dollar in
2019 from 1.3629 to 1.3248 between the beginning of the
year and the end of the third quarter, before finishing the
year stronger at 1.2994, due to commodity prices weighing
on the currency followed by a solid increase in domestic
demand, government spending and a strong job market
supporting the Canadian dollar.

The Mexican peso decreased in 2019 from 19.6437 on
December 31, 2018 to 20.0767 at the beginning of
September 2019 before finishing the year stronger at
18.8893 against the U.S. dollar, as 2019 growth was lower
than expected, followed by low interest rates in U.S. dollar
supporting the improvement.

The Brazilian real decreased in 2019 from 3.8748 on
December 31, 2018 to 4.2304 at the end of November 2019
before finishing the year stronger at 4.0307 against the U.S.
dollar, as a social security reform was approved.

The Argentine peso decreased in 2019 from 37.7003 on
December 31, 2018 to 59.8910 on December 31, 2019
against the U.S. dollar, as poor economy and debt issues
weighed on the local economy.

Trade and import competition
Europe

There has been a trend of imports growing more strongly
than domestic demand in Europe since 2012. ASC
increased approximately 14% between 2012 and 2019,
while finished steel imports increased by approximately
80%, taking market share from domestic producers. Over
this period total finished imports have risen from just over 15
million tonnes in 2012 to around 28 million tonnes in 2019,
causing import penetration to rise to 18% in 2019 from 11%
in 2012. A slowdown in global steel consumption coupled
with excess capacity in China led to increased finished steel
shipments into Europe in 2015, with import penetration
increasing to over 16%. Since then, Chinese imports into
Europe have fallen back from a peak of 7 million tonnes in
2015 to around 2.5 million tonnes in 2019. However, this
has been more than offset by an increase in imports from
Turkey (up from 2 million tonnes in 2015 to 7 million tonnes
in 2019) and developed Asia (2 million tonnes in 2014 to 4
million tonnes in 2019). Meanwhile, CIS imports have
remained the largest share (approximately 25%) remaining
relatively stable at an average of 7 million tonnes annually

between 2014 and 2019. While there has been a trend of
imports growing more strongly than domestic demand since
2012, in 2019, due to weakness in industrial output,
particularly European automotive production, ASC
decreased by 4%. As domestic European steel prices fell
sharply, imports followed suit decreasing approximately
10% year-on-year, particularly from CIS (down 12%),
developed Asia (down 14%), China (down 14%) and India
(down 20%). As a result, import penetration declined to 18%
in 2019 from 19.5% in 2018, with flat product imports
declining to 20% (from 22% in 2018) and long product
imports declining to 11% (from 13% in 2018). See —Risk
factors—Risks related to the global economy and the mining
and steel industry—Unfair trade practices, import tariffs and/
or barriers to free trade could negatively affect steel prices
and ArcelorMittal’s results of operations in various markets.

United States

Finished steel imports peaked in 2014 at almost 30 million
tonnes, declining to approximately 25.7 million tonnes in
2017 (or an import penetration of over 26%). In 2019, with
section 232 (implemented in 2018) adding a 25% tariff on
most imports outside NAFTA, finished steel imports
decreased by approximately 7 million tonnes from the levels
of 2017, despite the level of apparent steel consumption in
2019 being similar to 2017 levels. As a result, import
penetration has continued to fall, from 23% in 2018 to 19%
2019, as imports declined (-18% year-on-year) more sharply
than apparent steel consumption (-2% year-on-year). Import
penetration in 2019 was at 19%, close to the average level
between 2007 and 2013, but much lower than the 27%
average import penetration between 2014 and 2017.

Relative to other regions, imports from NAFTA decreased by
only approximately 15% year-on-year as section 232 tariffs
only applied until May 2019. As a result, over a third of
imports came from the NAFTA region, of which 27% came
from Canada and 9% from Mexico, up slightly from the two
countries’ 34% combined share in 2018. Other countries
such as Brazil, Ukraine, Australia and South Korea, though
not subject to 25% tariffs, are subject to quotas. Imports
decreased further from Turkey (down approximately 70%
year-on-year), where its share of imports declined from 5%
in 2018 to approximately 1% in 2019. Though declining
year-on-year, the breakdown of imports from the rest of the
world remained stable, with 20% of U.S. steel imports
coming from both Developed Asia (with the total down 14%
year-on-year) and from EU28 (total down 16% year-on-
year), with a 6% share from ASEAN (total down 19% year-
on-year), 3% from CIS (total down 13% year-on-year) and
approximately 2% from China (total down 21% year-on-
year). See —Risk factors—Risks related to the global
economy and the mining and steel industry—Unfair trade

Consolidation in the steel and mining industries

Prior to 2017, consolidation transactions had decreased
significantly in terms of number and value in the context of
economic uncertainties in developed economies combined
with a slowdown in emerging markets.

However, in an effort to reduce the worldwide structural
overcapacity, some key consolidation steps were
undertaken in 2019 and 2018, specifically in China and in
Europe.

Steel industry consolidation in China aims at enhancing
international competitiveness, reducing overcapacity,
rationalizing steel production based on obsolete technology,
improving energy efficiency, achieving environmental targets
and strengthening the bargaining position of Chinese steel
companies in price negotiations for iron ore. The Chinese
government set a target that 60 to 70 percent of steel
should be produced by the top ten steel groups by 2025.
China will soon release guidelines to foster mergers and
restructuring plans for the steel industry to facilitate the
creation of larger and stronger groups that can compete in
the global market. The guidelines, aiming to clear obstacles
in steel consolidation, will encourage cross-region and
cross-ownership mergers and restructuring by qualified
enterprises. Examples of recent merger activity in China
include the Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel
Group merger that was completed in late 2016, creating
Baowu Steel Group ("Baowu") with an annual production
capacity of around 60 million tonnes. Further, in September
2019, Baowu and Magang (Group) Holding Co., Ltd
("Magang") signed a partnership agreement where Baowu
secured a 51% stake in Magang, increasing Baowu's steel
production capacity to approximately 90 million tonnes and
representing a big step in the ongoing consolidation of the
Chinese steel industry.

In Europe, the proposed joint venture between
Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel, which would have created
Europe's second-largest steel company after ArcelorMittal,
was canceled in May 2019 as the joint venture partners
considered that the concessions required by the European
Commission to overcome its concerns over higher prices for
electrical steel, automotive steel and packaging, among
others, in the event of the merger, would adversely affect
the intended synergies of the merger. On October 29, 2019,
Liberty House Group announced a merger with GFG
Alliance's steel businesses to create Liberty Steel Group
with a capacity of 18 million tonnes and a plan to be carbon
neutral by 2030. According to the announcement, Liberty
Steel Group will be the eighth largest steel producer outside
China, with operations stretching from Australia to

Management report 25

continental Europe, the United Kingdom and the United
States.

In another step towards consolidation in the U.S., United
States Steel Corp announced on October 1, 2019 that it
reached an agreement to purchase a minority stake in Big
River Steel with an option to take complete control of the
company over the next four years. On December 3, 2019,
AK Steel and Cleveland Cliffs announced an all stock
merger which is expected to close in the first half of 2020.

In November 2018, ArcelorMittal completed the acquisition
(via a long-term lease) of ArcelorMittal Italia, Europe’s
largest single steel site and only integrated steelmaker in
Italy with its main production facility based in Taranto.
ArcelorMittal Italia also has significant steel finishing
capacity in Taranto, Novi Ligure and Genova. The
transaction was approved by the European Commission on
May 7, 2018 subject to the disposal of certain assets in Italy,
Romania, North Macedonia, the Czech Republic,
Luxembourg and Belgium, which were completed in June
2019. ArcelorMittal is engaged in ongoing negotiations with
the Italian government regarding ArcelorMittal Italia. See
Key transactions and events in 2019.

In the first quarter of 2018, ArcelorMittal signed a joint
venture formation agreement with NSC and submitted its
Resolution Plan for the acquisition of AMNS India, setting
out a positive future for the bankrupt company, an integrated
flat steel producer and the largest steel company in western
India. The acquisition was completed in December 2019,
and ArcelorMittal announced the creation of its joint venture
with NSC. The Company’s Resolution Plan for AMNS India
should enable it to participate in anticipated steel demand
growth in India. See Key transactions and events in 2019.

Further future consolidation should allow the steel industry
to perform more consistently through industry cycles by
achieving greater efficiencies and economies of scale.

Critical accounting policies and use of judgments and
estimates

Management's discussion and analysis of ArcelorMittal’s
operational results and financial condition is based on
ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS
recognition and measurement principles and, in particular,
making the critical accounting judgments highlighted below
require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. Management reviews its estimates on an
ongoing basis using currently available information.
Changes in facts and circumstances or obtaining new
information or more experience may result in revised
estimates, and actual results could differ from those
estimates.

assumptions are made may be found in note 1.2 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Key indicators

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report.

ArcelorMittal reports its operations in five reportable
segments: NAFTA, Brazil, Europe, ACIS and Mining. The
key performance indicators that ArcelorMittal’s management
uses to analyze operations are sales, average steel selling
prices, crude steel production, steel shipments, iron ore and
coal production and operating income. Management's
analysis of liquidity and capital resources is driven by net

cash provided by operating activities less capital
expenditures.

This annual report includes net debt and operating working
capital, which are alternative performance measures.
ArcelorMittal believes net debt and operating working capital
to be relevant to enhance the understanding of its financial
position and provides additional information to investors and
management with respect to the Company's operating cash
flows, capital structure and credit assessment. Alternative
performance measures should be read in conjunction with
and not as an alternative for, ArcelorMittal’s financial
information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Such
alternative performance measures may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures applied by other companies.

Sales

ArcelorMittal had sales of $70.6 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2019, representing a 7.1% decrease from
sales of $76.0 billion for the year ended December 31,
2018, primarily due to a 9.6% decrease in average steel
selling prices, partially offset by a 0.8% increase in steel
shipments and higher marketable iron ore selling prices. In
the first half of 2019, sales were $38.5 billion decreasing
1.8% from sales of $39.2 billion in the first half of 2018,
primarily due to 6.1% lower average steel selling prices,
partially offset by 3.5% higher steel shipments. In the
second half of 2019, sales of $32.1 billion represented a
12.8% decrease as compared to sales of $36.8 billion in the
second half of 2018, primarily driven by a 13.7% decrease
in average steel selling prices and a 2.1% decrease in steel
shipments.

ArcelorMittal had sales of $76.0 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018, representing a 10.7% increase from
sales of $68.7 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017, primarily due to a 13.5% increase in the average steel
selling prices, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in steel
shipments. In the first half of 2018, sales were $39.2 billion
increasing from sales of $33.3 billion in the first half of 2017,
primarily due to 16.7% higher average steel selling prices.
In the second half of 2018, sales of $36.8 billion
represented a 4.2% increase as compared to sales of $35.3
billion in the second half of 2017, primarily driven by a
10.6% increase in average steel selling prices, partially
offset by a 4.5% decrease in steel shipments.

Cost of sales

Cost of sales consists primarily of purchases of raw
materials necessary for steel-making (iron ore, coke and
coking coal, scrap and alloys), electricity, repair and
maintenance costs, as well as direct labor costs,
depreciation and impairment. Cost of sales for the year
ended December 31, 2019 was $68.9 billion as compared to
$67.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to
an increase in shipments (primarily due to the inclusion of
ArcelorMittal Italia from November 1, 2018, partially offset
by the sale of remedy asset as of June 30, 2019), an
increase in raw material costs, impairment charges of $1.9
billion related to impairment of the fixed assets of
ArcelorMittal USA ($1.3 billion - see NAFTA below), remedy
asset sales in connection with the ArcelorMittal Italia
acquisition ($0.5 billion) and impairment charges in South
Africa ($0.1 billion) as well as $0.8 billion primarily for
inventory related charges in NAFTA and Europe following a
period of exceptionally weak steel pricing. Selling, general
and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $2.4 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.5 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2018. SG&A as a
percentage of sales increased marginally for the year ended
December 31, 2019 (3.3%) as compared to 2018 (3.2%).

Management report 27

Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was
$67.0 billion as compared to $60.9 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017, primarily due to a 9.4% increase in raw
material costs (consistent with the increase in sales) and
impairment charges of $1.0 billion primarily related to the
remedy asset sales in connection with the ArcelorMittal Italia
acquisition and the agreed remedy package required for the
approval of the AMSF acquisition, partially offset by the $0.2
billion in gain from a bargain purchase recognized with
respect to the acquisition of ArcelorMittal Italia. Selling,
general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $2.5
billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to
$2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. SG&A
as a percentage of sales decreased for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (3.2%) as compared to 2017 (3.4%).

Operating (loss) income

ArcelorMittal’s operating loss for the year ended December
31, 2019 was $0.6 billion as compared with an operating
income of $6.5 billion for the year ended December 31,
2018 and was primarily impacted by weaker operating
conditions (negative price-cost effect in steel segments)
reflecting both the decline in steel prices and higher raw
material costs (due in particular to supply-side
developments in Brazil), impairments and inventory related
charges described above, offset in part by improved mining
segment performance driven by higher seaborne iron ore
reference prices (which were up 34.3%). The raw material
prices increased during 2019 and for most of the year
remained disconnected from steel fundamentals,
compressing steel spreads to unsustainably low levels.

ArcelorMittal's operating income for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was $6.5 billion as compared with an
operating income of $5.4 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and was primarily driven by improved
operating conditions (positive price-cost effect in the steel
segments), offset in part by the impact of lower iron ore
reference prices and impairment charges of $1.0 billion
primarily related to the remedy asset sales in connection
with the ArcelorMittal Italia acquisition and the agreed
remedy package required for the approval of the AMSF
acquisition, partially offset by a $0.2 billion bargain purchase
gain relating to the acquisition of ArcelorMittal Italia.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018
was also impacted by $113 million in charges related to a
blast furnace dismantling in Florange (France), $60 million
in charges related to the new collective labor agreement in
the United States (including a signing bonus), a $146 million
provision taken in the first quarter of 2018 in respect of a
litigation case that was paid in the third quarter of 2018,
offset in part by the recognition in Brazil of $202 million in
PIS/Cofins tax credits related to prior periods.

28 Management report

Shipments and average steel selling price

ArcelorMittal had steel shipments of 84.5 million tonnes for
the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to steel
shipments of 83.9 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2018, representing an increase of 0.8%,
primarily due to higher steel shipments in Europe by 3.2%
due to the impact of the consolidation of ArcelorMittal Italia
as from November 1, 2018, offset in part by the remedy
asset sales related to the ArcelorMittal Italia acquisition
(completed on June 30, 2019) and ongoing weak demand
driven by macro headwinds including declines in automobile
production. Weaker domestic apparent demand conditions
led to lower shipments in NAFTA (5.1%), while weaker
export markets led to lower shipments in ACIS (1.7%) and
Brazil (2.4%).

Steel shipments increased 3.5% to 44.6 million tonnes in
the first half of 2019 compared to 43.1 million tonnes for the
first half of 2018 while steel shipments decreased 2.1% to
39.9 million tonnes in the second half of 2019 compared to
40.8 million tonnes in the second half of 2018.

ArcelorMittal had steel shipments of 83.9 million tonnes for
the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to steel
shipments of 85.2 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of 1.6%,
primarily due to a 10.3% decline in shipments in ACIS
(including unplanned maintenance in Ukraine and
operational issues in Kazakhstan/Ukraine) offset in part by

increases in Brazil (5.8%, including the impact of the
Votorantim acquisition), NAFTA (1.0%, including the impact
of a slower restart post blast furnace maintenance in
Mexico) and Europe (0.2%, including the impact from the
Ilva acquisition offset by the effect of a flood in Asturias
(Spain), power outage in Fos (France) and slower ramp-up
after the blast furnace reline in Poland). Steel shipments
increased 1.3% to 43.1 million tonnes in the first half of
2018 compared to 42.5 million tonnes for the first half of
2017 while steel shipments decreased 4.5% to 40.8 million
tonnes in the second half of 2018 compared to 42.7 million
tonnes in the second half of 2017.

Average steel selling price decreased by 9.6% for the year
ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018. Average steel selling price in the first
half of 2019 decreased by 6.1% as compared to the first half
of 2018 and decreased by 13.7% in the second half of 2019
as compared to the second half of 2018.

Average steel selling price increased by 13.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017. Average steel selling price in the first
half of 2018 increased by 16.7% as compared to the first
half of 2017 and increased by 10.5% in the second half of
2018 as compared to the second half of 2017.

Sales

Sales in the NAFTA segment were $18.6 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2019, representing a 8.7% decrease
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales
decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in average
steel selling prices by 4.9% and a decrease in steel
shipments by 5.1%.

Sales in the NAFTA segment were $20.3 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2018, representing a 13.0% increase
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales
increased primarily as a result of the increase in average

steel selling prices by 14.8% and a 1.0% increase in steel
shipments.

Operating (loss) income

Operating loss for the NAFTA segment was $1.3 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to
operating income of $1.9 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily driven by a 5.1% decline in
steel shipments and a negative price cost effect due toa
4.9% decrease in average steel selling prices, reflecting
weaker demand exacerbated by prolonged customer
destocking and increased domestic supply with prices well


--- Page 26 ---

below import parity, and an increase in raw material prices.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019
was negatively impacted by an impairment in the second
quarter of 2019 of property, plant and equipment of
ArcelorMittal USA for $0.6 billion and a further impairment in
the fourth quarter of 2019 of the property, plant and
equipment of ArcelorMittal USA for $0.7 billion following
downward revisions of future cash flow projections reflecting
lower near term average steel selling price assumptions.
Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 also
included $0.2 billion in charges related to inventory
following a period of exceptionally weak steel pricing.

Operating income for the NAFTA segment was $1.9 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to
operating income of $1.2 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017, primarily driven by a 14.8% increase in
average steel selling prices. Operating income for the year
ended December 31, 2018 included $60 million in charges
related to the new collective labor agreement in the United
States (which included a signing bonus).

Crude steel production, steel shipments and average steel
selling price

Crude steel production decreased 2.9% to 21.9 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared
to 22.6 million tonnes for the year ended December 31,
2018. Crude steel production declined in the first half of
2019 primarily due to the restart of a blast furnace in Mexico
which was only fully operational in the second quarter of
2019 after scheduled maintenance in the third quarter of
2018, loss due to power outage in Burns Harbour in the first
quarter of 2019 and a slowdown following weaker market
demand in the first half while production in the second half
of 2019 was 1.6% higher than the second half of 2018
mainly due to the impact of the scheduled maintenance of a
blast furnace in Mexico from third quarter of 2018, partly
offset by planned outages both in flat and long product
operations in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Crude steel production decreased 3.9% to 22.6 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared
to 23.5 million tonnes for the year ended December 31,
2017. Crude steel production declined in particular in the

Management report 29

second half of 2018, primarily due to market slowdown and
blast furnace reline delay in Mexico.

Steel shipments decreased 5.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018 reflecting the decreased production and
market demand during the year (including pronounced
supply chain destocking).

Steel shipments increased 1.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017 reflecting improved demand in the first
half and a slowdown and the impact of the blast furnace
delay in the second half. Shipments were 11.4 million
tonnes for the first half of 2018, an increase of 3% from 11
million tonnes in the first half of 2017, in line with available
inventory. Shipments decreased 1.1% to 10.7 million tonnes
in the second half of 2018 as compared to 10.8 million
tonnes in the second half of 2017.

Average steel selling prices decreased 4.9% for the year
ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018. Average steel selling prices increased
4.7% to $855/t in the first half of 2019 from $817/t in the first
half of 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, average steel
selling prices were 12.1% higher than the first quarter of
2018 while in the second quarter of 2019, average steel
selling prices were 1.9% and 4.3% lower than the second
quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, respectively. This
decline continued in the second half of 2019 with average
steel selling prices decreasing by 14.3% compared to the
second half of 2018, reflecting the ongoing supply chain
destock. The average steel selling prices in the second half
of 2018 were higher following the imposition of import tariffs
on steel in the second quarter of 2018.

Average steel selling prices increased 14.8% for the year
ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017 in particular as a result of import tariffs
on steel implemented in the United States. Average steel
selling prices increased 10.5% for the first half of 2018 as
compared to the first half of 2017 and 19.4% for the second
half of 2018 as compared to the second half of 2017.

Sales

In the Brazil segment, sales decreased 6.9% to $8.1 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a 5.5%
decrease in average steel selling prices and a 2.4%
decrease in shipments. In the first half of 2019, sales
increased 2.5% to 4.3 billion as compared to $4.2 billion for
the first half of 2018 primarily due to 6.6% higher steel
shipments partially offset by 4.7% lower average steel
selling prices while in the second half of 2019, sales
decreased 15.5% compared to the second half of 2018
driven by a 10.1% decrease in shipments and a 7.0%
decrease in average steel selling prices.

In the Brazil segment, sales increased 12.3% to $8.7 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a 7.7%
increase in average steel selling prices and a 5.8% increase
in shipments. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2018
were also negatively impacted by hyperinflation accounting
in Argentina.

Operating income

Operating income for the Brazil segment was $0.8 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a
decrease of 37.6% as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018, driven primarily by a negative price-
cost effect reflecting in part the increasing price of iron ore
due to supply-side developments in Brazil, foreign exchange
translation impact and lower steel shipments in the second
half of 2019.

Operating income for the Brazil segment was $1.4 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an
increase of 94.6% as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017, primarily driven by increased
shipments and higher average steel selling prices.
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018
was negatively affected by foreign exchange translation
impact, hyperinflation in Argentina and $86 million
impairment related to the agreed remedy package required
for the approval of the AMSF acquisition. It was positively
affected by the recognition of $202 million additional PIS/
Cofins tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2018 relating to
favorable judgments obtained in cases filed by ArcelorMittal
Brasil concerning the period of 2005 to 2013. See note 9.3
to the consolidated financial statements for further
information on pending cases related to the PIS/Cofins
topic.

Crude steel production, steel shipments and average steel
selling price

Crude steel production decreased 10.3% to 11.0 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared
to 12.3 million tonnes for the year ended December 31,
2018 mainly due to lower flat production following the
stoppage of ArcelorMittal Tubarao's blast furnace #2 in
response to deteriorating export market conditions and
lower long product production.

Crude steel production increased 9.4% to 12.3 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared
to 11.2 million tonnes for the year ended December 31,
2017 mainly due to an increase in long products following
the integration of AMSF. Excluding AMSF, crude steel
production increased 4.9%.

Steel shipments decreased to 11.2 million tonnes for the
year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 11.5 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2018. Steel
shipments in the first half of 2019 increased 6.6% to 5.7
million tonnes as compared to 5.3 million tonnes in the first
half of 2018 due to higher sales of flat products in both
domestic and export markets, while shipments for the
second half of 2019 decreased 10.1% to 5.5 million tonnes
compared to 6.2 million tonnes for the second half of 2018
due to deteriorating export market conditions.

Steel shipments increased to 11.5 million tonnes for the
year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 10.8 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting
the contribution from the acquisition of AMSF. Excluding
AMSF, steel shipments increased 0.5%. Total steel
shipments in the Brazil segment increased 9.6% to 5.3
million tonnes for the first half of 2018 as compared to 4.8
million tonnes for the first half of 2017, driven by improved
demand in long products and the integration of AMSF,
partially offset by a nationwide truck strike. Total steel
shipments in the Brazil segment increased 2.6% to 6.2
million tonnes in the second half of 2018 as compared to 6.0
million tonnes for the second half of 2017.

Average steel selling prices decreased 5.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018 in line with domestic and export prices.
Average steel selling prices declined 4.7% in the first half of
2019 compared to first half of 2018 and 7.0% in the second
half of 2019 compared to the second half of 2018.

Average steel selling prices increased 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December
31, 2017 in line with international prices. Average steel selling prices in the Brazil segment increased 11.0% for the six months
ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, in line with domestic and export prices, and 4.9%
during the second half of 2018 as compared to the second half of 2017.

Sales

Sales in the Europe segment were $37.7 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2019, representing an 6.8% decrease
as compared to sales of $40.5 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to a 11.7% decrease in
average steel selling prices offset in part by a 3.2% increase
in steel shipments. Sales decreased by 1.3% and 12.9% in
the first and second half of 2019 as compared to the first
and second half of 2018, respectively.

Sales in the Europe segment were $40.5 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2018, representing an 11.8% increase
as compared to sales of $36.2 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017, primarily due to a 12.2% increase in
average steel selling prices, a 0.2% increase in steel
shipments and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
the euro.

Operating (loss) income

Operating loss for the Europe segment for the year ended
December 31, 2019 was $1.1 billion as compared to an
income of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31,
2018. The operating loss was impacted by a negative price-
cost effect (with lower steel pricing due to weaker economic
activity and continued high level of imports, as well as
higher raw material costs), continued losses at ArcelorMittal
Italia, foreign exchange impact, an impairment of $0.5 billion
in the first half of 2019 related to the remedy asset sales for
the ArcelorMittal Italia acquisition and inventory related
charges of $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 following
a period of exceptionally weak steel pricing. For the
purposes of comparison with the prior year, the operating
loss contribution (excluding purchase price allocation impact
in 2018 and full year depreciation effect in 2019) of
ArcelorMittal Italia for 2019 deteriorated by $0.6 billion
compared to 2018 as it was consolidated from November 1,
2018.

Operating income for the Europe segment for the year
ended December 31, 2018 decreased to $1.6 billion as
compared to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017, primarily due to the impairment charges of $908
million mainly related to the remedy asset sales for the

acquisition of ArcelorMittal Italia (reflecting the adjustment to
the carrying amount of the disposal group to the expected
sale proceeds based on the offers received) as well as
charges of $113 million related to blast furnace dismantling
in Florange (France) and a charge of $146 million taken for
the German Cartel case which settled in July 2018.
Operating income for the Europe segment for the year
ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted by $209
million of bargain purchase gain recognized with respect to
the acquisition of ArcelorMittal Italia.

Crude steel production, steel shipments and average steel
selling price

Crude steel production for the Europe segment decreased
1.7% to 43.9 million tonnes for the year ended December
31, 2019 as compared to 44.7 million tonnes for the year
ended December 31, 2018. In the first half of 2019, crude
steel production increased 9.8% to 24.5 million tonnes from
22.3 million tonnes in the first half of 2018, primarily due to
the impact of ArcelorMittal Italia (subsequent to its
acquisition on November 1, 2018). The Company
announced production cuts in May 2019 for approximately
4.2 million tonnes of annualized production to bring supply
in line with addressable demand. The production cuts were
implemented in the second half of 2019, with a portion
taking effect in the third quarter of 2019 and the remainder
completed as scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2019. Crude
steel production decreased 13.2% in the second half of
2019 compared to the second half of 2018, including the
impact of the remedy asset sales for the ArcelorMittal Italia
acquisition with effect from June 30, 2019 and production
cuts mentioned above.

Crude steel production for the Europe segment increased
2.1% to 44.7 million tonnes for the year ended December
31, 2018 as compared to 43.8 million tonnes for the year
ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to the
consolidation of ArcelorMittal Italia as from November 1,
2018, partially offset by production issues including floods in
Asturias (Spain) and blast furnace reline in ArcelorMittal
Zenica (Bosnia) in the second quarter and a power outage

in ArcelorMittal Méditerranée (Fos-sur-Mer, France) and a
slower ramp up following a blast furnace repair in Poland in
the third quarter of 2018.

Steel shipments were 42.4 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2019, a 3.2% increase from steel shipments
of 41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Steel
shipments increased 10.1% to 23.4 million tonnes in the first
half of 2019, from 21.2 million tonnes in the first half of
2018, primarily due to the impact of ArcelorMittal Italia as
mentioned above, partially offset by lower long product
shipments, while shipments in the first half of 2018 were
impacted by floods in Asturias, Spain and rail strikes in
France. Steel shipments decreased 4.13% in the second
half of 2019 compared to the second half of 2018, due to
the impact of the remedy asset sales for the ArcelorMittal
Italia acquisition and the impact of ongoing weak demand,
in particular macroeconomic headwinds including declines
in automobile production.

Steel shipments were 41.0 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2018, a 0.2% increase from steel shipments
of 40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the
first half of 2018, steel shipments increased 2.6% to 21.2
million tonnes, from 20.7 million tonnes in the first half of
2017, both for flat and long products partially offset by the
operational issues described above, while steel shipments

in the second half of 2018 decreased 2.3% to 19.8 million
tonnes from 20.3 million tonnes in the second half of 2017
due to weak market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2018,
particularly in long products, and the operational issues
described above, partially offset by the consolidation of Ilva
as from November 1, 2018.

Average steel selling prices decreased 11.7% for the year
ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018 in line with market prices and the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro in 2019.
Average steel selling prices decreased 10.5% during the
first half of 2019 as compared to the first half of 2018 in line

Sales

Sales in the ACIS segment were $6.8 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of
14.1% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to a 13.6% decrease in average steel selling
prices and a 1.7% decrease in steel shipments.

Sales in the ACIS segment were $8.0 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of
4.5% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017,
primarily due to a 16.1% increase in average steel selling
prices, partially offset by a 10.3% decrease in steel
shipments.

Operating (loss) income

Operating loss for the ACIS segment for the year ended
December 31, 2019 was $25 million as compared to an
income of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31,
2018, primarily due to a negative price-cost effect, lower
shipments, impairments of $0.1 billion related to
ArcelorMittal South Africa (of which $75 million related to the
fixed assets of the Newcastle facility as a result of lower
domestic volume forecasts and $20 million related to the
closure of the Saldanha facility) and $0.1 billion of closure
and retrenchment costs related to the Saldanha facility in
relation to the announced Section 189 process.

Operating income for the ACIS segment for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was $1.1 billion as compared to $508
million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing
primarily due to a positive price-cost effect and partially
offset by the decrease in shipments in 2018.

Crude steel production, steel shipments and average steel
selling price

Crude steel production for the ACIS segment decreased
marginally by 0.2% remaining at 13.0 million tonnes for the
year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Crude steel production for the ACIS segment decreased by
11.3% to 13.0 million tonnes for the year ended December
31, 2018, from 14.7 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2017, primarily due to planned (blast furnace
#9) and unplanned maintenance in Ukraine in the first half
of 2018 and an explosion at a gas pipeline at Temirtau
(Kazakhstan) in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Steel shipments for the year ended December 31, 2019
decreased by 1.7% to 11.5 million tonnes as compared to
11.7 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2018
primarily due to lower shipments in South Africa impacted
by weaker demand, offset in part by the normalization of
production in the second quarter of 2019 at Temirtau
following the explosion described above.

Management report 33

Steel shipments for the year ended December 31, 2018
decreased by 10.3% to 11.7 million tonnes as compared to
13.1 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017
reflecting the operational issues mentioned above. In the
first half of 2018, steel shipments decreased 6.1% to 6.1
million tonnes from 6.5 million tonnes in the first half of 2017
due to lower CIS shipments partially offset by higher steel
shipments in South Africa, while steel shipments in the
second half of 2018 decreased 14.5% to 5.7 million as
compared to 6.6 million in the second half of 2017, primarily
due to lower steel shipments in CIS following the incidents
mentioned above.

Average steel selling prices decreased 13.6% for the year
ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018 in line with market prices. Average steel

1. There are three categories of sales: (1) “External sales”:

ined product sold to third parties at market price; (2) “Market-priced tonnes’: internal sales of mined

product to ArcelorMittal facilities reported at prevailing market prices; (3) “Cost-plus tonnes”: internal sales of mined product to ArcelorMittal facilities on a cost-
plus basis. The determinant of whether internal sales are reported at market price or reported at cost-plus is whether or not the raw material could practically be
sold to third parties (i.¢., there is a potential market for the product and logistics exist to access that market).

2. Market-priced tonnes represent amounts of iron ore and coal from ArcelorMittal mines that could practically be sold to third parties. Market-priced tonnes that are
transferred from the Mining segment to the Company's steel producing segments are reported at the prevailing market price. Shipments of raw materials that do

not constitute market-priced tonnes are transferred internally on a cost-plus basis.

Fe US § per tonne, Metal Bulletin) and the average
reference price for hard coking coal was $176.71 per tonne
in 2019, $206.62 per tonne in 2018 and $187.28 per tonne
in 2017 (Premium HCC FOB Aus, Metal Bulletin). However,
there may not be a direct correlation between reference
prices and actual selling prices in various regions at a given
time.

Operating income

Operating income for the Mining segment was $1,215
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared
to $860 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily driven by the increase in the iron ore reference


--- Page 32 ---

prices offset in part by the reduction in market-priced iron
ore shipments and lower coking coal reference prices and
lower iron ore quality premia.

Operating income for the Mining segment was $860 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to
$991 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
primarily driven by the decrease in the iron ore reference
prices and lower coal volumes.

Production

ArcelorMittal had iron ore production of 57.1 million tonnes
for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 2.3%
compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Iron ore
production decreased 1.3% for the first half of 2019
compared to the first half of 2018 primarily due to lower
production in Brazil due to the temporary suspension of
Serra Azul in Brazil (following evacuation on February 8,
2019) which restarted on March 18, 2019, Liberia, Temirtau
and Mexico (Volcan mine reached end of life in May 2019),
partially offset by higher production in Canada and Ukraine.
lron ore production decreased 3.4% for the second half of
2019 compared to the second half of 2018 primarily due to
lower production in AMMC (following an electrical failure in
the third quarter of 2019 which led to a temporary stoppage
of the concentrator followed by a slow ramp-up in the fourth
quarter of 2019) and the Volcan mine end of life in Mexico,
offset in part by higher production in Kazakhstan.

ArcelorMittal had iron ore production of 58.5 million tonnes
for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 1.9%
compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily
due to Liberia (production of 4.6 million tonnes in 2018
which, although above the 2017 level, was slightly below the
5 million tonne full year capacity, due to handling/logistical
issues at the new Gangra deposit during the wet season in
the second half of 2018), offset in part by lower production
in Canada (lower yield from a new mix of ore bodies
following a pit wall instability issue which first occurred in the
fourth quarter of 2017) and Mexico.

ArcelorMittal had coking coal production of 5.5 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease
of 7.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
mainly due to lower production in both Kazakhstan and
Princeton.

ArcelorMittal had own coking coal production of 5.9 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease
of 6.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
mainly due to lower production in the Kazakhstan mines
following operational and geological issues.

Income or loss from investments in associates, joint
ventures and other investments

ArcelorMittal recorded income of $347 million from
investments in associates, joint ventures and other

investments for the year ended December 31, 2019, as
compared to $652 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 driven by lower profitability of Calvert and Chinese
investee and includes a dividend income from Erdemir of
$93 million as compared to $87 million in 2018.

ArcelorMittal recorded income of $652 million from
investments in associates, joint ventures and other
investments for the year ended December 31, 2018, as
compared to $448 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 and includes a dividend income from Erdemir of $87
million as compared to $45 million in 2017.

Financing costs-net

Financing costs-net include net interest expense,
revaluation of financial instruments, net foreign exchange
income/expense (i.e., the net effects of transactions in a
foreign currency other than the functional currency of a
subsidiary) and other net financing costs (which mainly
include bank fees, accretion of defined benefit obligations
and other long-term liabilities).

Net financing costs were lower at $1.7 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.2 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2018. Net interest expense
(interest expense less interest income) was lower at $607
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared
to $615 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Foreign exchange gains were $4.0 million as compared to a
loss of $235 million for the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2018, respectively. The 2018 loss was primarily due to
the first quarter of 2018 as described below.

Other net financing costs (including expenses related to true
sale of receivables, bank fees, interest on pensions and fair
value adjustments of the call option of the mandatorily
convertible bond and derivative instruments) were $1.0
billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to
$1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, and
included mark-to-market losses related to the mandatory
convertible bond call option totaling $356 million as
compared to $501 million for the year ended December 31,
2018.

Net financing costs were higher at $2.2 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $0.9 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2017. Net interest expense
(interest expense less interest income) was lower at $0.6
billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared
to $0.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, driven
by debt reduction including early bond repayments and
lower cost of debt.

Foreign exchange losses were $235 million as compared to
a gain of $546 million for the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The foreign exchange losses
were primarily due to the effect of the depreciation of the

36 Management report

U.S. dollar against the euro on the Company's euro
denominated debt in the first quarter of 2018. As of April 1,
2018, the Company designated a portfolio of euro
denominated debt (€5,169 million as of December 31, 2018)
as a hedge of certain euro denominated investments
(€7,804 million as of December 31, 2018) in order to
mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from certain euro
denominated subsidiaries’ net assets. The risk arises from
the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and euro, which causes the amount of the net
investments to vary. The hedged risk in the hedge of net
investments is a risk of a weakening euro against the U.S.
dollar that will result in a reduction in the carrying amount of
the Company's net investments in the subsidiaries subject
to the hedge. The euro denominated debt is designated as
a hedging instrument for the change in the value of the net
investments that is attributable to changes in the euro/U.S.
dollar spot rate. As a result, the Company's statement of
operations no longer includes foreign exchange exposure
on such euro denominated debt.

Other net financing costs (including expenses related to true
sale of receivables, bank fees, interest on pensions and fair
value adjustments of the call option of the mandatorily
convertible bond and derivative instruments) were $1.4
billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to
$0.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, and
included mark-to-market losses related to the mandatory
convertible bond call option totaling $0.5 billion as
compared to gains of $0.8 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017. Other net financing costs for the year
ended December 31, 2018 also included $0.1 billion
premium expense on the early redemption of bonds as
compared to $0.4 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017. Other net financing costs in 2017 were negatively
affected by mark-to-market losses relating to a derivative
embedded in a pellet supply agreement in the United States
(due to a payment based on the evolution of the price of
steel in the United States domestic steel market) of $0.3
billion.

Income tax expense (benefit)

ArcelorMittal recorded an income tax expense of $0.5 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to
income tax benefit of $0.3 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The current income tax expense of
$786 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as
compared to $928 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 was primarily driven by lower results in a number of
countries. The deferred tax benefit of $327 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $0.3 billion

reduction of deferred tax assets following tax rate decrease
in Luxembourg and a $0.6 billion deferred tax benefit
recorded in Luxembourg, due to the expectation of higher
future profits.

ArcelorMittal recorded an income tax benefit of $0.3 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to
income tax expense of $0.4 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017. The current income tax expense of
$928 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as
compared to $583 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 was primarily driven by improved results in a number
of countries. The deferred tax benefit of $1,277 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with a
deferred tax benefit of $151 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 included a $1.4 billion deferred tax
benefit recorded mainly in Luxembourg, due to the
expectation of higher future profits. This benefit included a
$0.6 billion deferred tax income in the context of the change
in the currency denomination of the Company's tax losses in
Luxembourg as the revised taxable income projections in
U.S. dollar terms reflect a change in the foreign currency
exposure of the different income streams. Following the
May 16, 2018 approval of the extraordinary general meeting
("EGM") to change the share capital of the ArcelorMittal
parent company from euro to U.S. dollar, the parent
company will file consolidated tax returns in U.S. dollar for
the main Luxembourg tax integration going forward. The
euro denominated tax losses and the related deferred tax
asset held by the ArcelorMittal parent company in
Luxembourg were translated into U.S. dollar effective as of
January 1, 2018.

ArcelorMittal’s consolidated income tax expense (benefit) is
affected by the income tax laws and regulations in effect in
the various countries in which it operates and the pre-tax
results of its subsidiaries in each of these countries, which
can change from year to year. ArcelorMittal operates in
jurisdictions, mainly in Eastern Europe and Asia, which have
a structurally lower corporate income tax rate than the
statutory tax rate as enacted in Luxembourg (24.94%), as
well as in jurisdictions, mainly in Brazil and Mexico, which
have a structurally higher corporate income tax rate.

The statutory income tax expense (benefit) and the statutory
income tax rates of the countries that most significantly
resulted in the tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate for
each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and
2017 are as set forth below:

Non-controlling interests

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $63
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared
to $181 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net
income attributable to non-controlling interests decreased in
2019 primarily as a result of the operating performance of
ArcelorMittal South Africa.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was
$181 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as
compared to $7 million for the year ended December 31,
2017. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests
increased in 2018 primarily as a result of the improved
operating performance of ArcelorMittal South Africa.

Net income attributable to equity holders of the parent

ArcelorMittal’s net loss attributable to equity holders of the
parent was $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31,
2019, compared to net income attributable to equity holders
of the parent of $5.1 billion and $4.6 billion for the years
ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Liquidity and capital resources

ArcelorMittal’s principal sources of liquidity are cash
generated from its operations and its credit facilities at the
corporate level.

Because ArcelorMittal is a holding company, it is dependent
upon the earnings and cash flows of, as well as dividends
and distributions from, its operating subsidiaries to pay
expenses and meet its debt service obligations. Significant
cash or cash equivalent balances may be held from time to
time at the Company’s international subsidiaries, in
particular those in France and in the United States, where
the Company maintains cash management systems under
which most of its cash and cash equivalents are centralized,
and in Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan, South Africa and
Ukraine. Some of these operating subsidiaries have debt
outstanding or are subject to acquisition agreements that
impose restrictions on such operating subsidiaries’ ability to
pay dividends, but such restrictions are not significant in the
context of ArcelorMittal’s overall liquidity. Repatriation of
funds from operating subsidiaries may also be affected by
tax and foreign exchange policies in place from time to time
in the various countries where the Company operates,
though none of these policies is currently significant in the
context of ArcelorMittal’s overall liquidity.

In management's opinion, ArcelorMittal’s credit facilities are
adequate for its present requirements.

38 Management report

As of December 31, 2019, ArcelorMittal’s cash and cash
equivalents, including restricted cash of $128 million,
amounted to $5.0 billion as compared to $2.4 billion as of
December 31, 2018. In addition, ArcelorMittal had available
borrowing capacity of $5.5 billion under its $5.5 billion
revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

As of December 31, 2019, ArcelorMittal’s total debt, which
includes long-term debt and short-term debt was $14.3
billion, compared to $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2018.

Net debt (defined as long-term debt ($11.5 billion) plus
short-term debt ($2.9 billion) including debt classified as
held for sale (nil), less cash and cash equivalents and
restricted cash ($5.0 billion)) was $9.3 billion as of
December 31, 2019, down from $10.2 billion at December
31, 2018, comprised of long-term debt ($9.3 billion) plus
short-term debt ($3.2 billion) including debt classified as
held for sale ($0.1 billion), less cash and cash equivalents
and restricted cash ($2.4 billion). Most of the external debt
is borrowed by the parent company on an unsecured basis
and bears interest at varying levels based on a combination
of fixed and variable interest rates. Gearing (defined as net
debt divided by total equity) at December 31, 2019 and
2018 was 23%.

The margin applicable to ArcelorMittal’s principal credit
facilities ($5.5 billion revolving credit facility and certain
other credit facilities) and the coupons on certain of its
outstanding bonds are subject to adjustment in the event of
a change in its long-term credit ratings. In 2019,
ArcelorMittal's credit ratings remained unchanged although
outlooks were revised as described in the Risk Factors
above. ArcelorMittal has a substantial amount of
indebtedness, which could make it more difficult or
expensive to refinance its maturing debt, incur new debt
and/or flexibly manage its business and the market's
perception of ArcelorMittal's leverage may affect its share
price.

ArcelorMittal’s $5.5 billion revolving credit facility signed on
December 19, 2018 with a maturity of December 19, 2023.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, ArcelorMittal executed the
option to extend the facility to December 19, 2024. The
extension was completed for $5.4 billion of the available
amount, with the remaining $0.1 billion remaining with a
maturity of December 19, 2023 as of December 31, 2019.
The facility may be further extended for an additional year in
December 2020. The facility contains restrictive covenants,
which among other things, limit encumbrances on the
assets of ArcelorMittal and its subsidiaries, the ability of
ArcelorMittal’s subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of
ArcelorMittal and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets in
certain circumstances. The agreement also requires
compliance with a financial covenant, as summarized below.

The Company must ensure that the ratio of “Consolidated
Total Net Borrowings” (consolidated total borrowings less
consolidated cash and cash equivalents) to “Consolidated
EBITDA’ (the consolidated net pre-taxation profits of the
ArcelorMittal group for a Measurement Period, subject to
certain adjustments as set out in the facility) does not, at the
end of each “Measurement Period” (each period of 12
months ending on the last day of a financial half-year or a
financial year of the Company), exceed a certain ratio,
referred to by the Company as the “Leverage ratio”.
ArcelorMittal’s principal credit facilities set this ratio to 4.25
to 1. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in
compliance with the ratio.

Non-compliance with the covenants in the Company's
borrowing agreements would entitle the lenders under such
facilities to accelerate the Company's repayment
obligations. The Company was in compliance with the
financial covenants in the agreements related to all of its
borrowings as of December 31, 2019 and December 31,
2018.

As of December 31, 2019, ArcelorMittal had guaranteed
$236 million of debt of its operating subsidiaries, including
$23 million following the adoption of IFRS 16 for which the
Company recognized additional liabilities, compared to $99
million as of December 31, 2018. See also note 9.4 to the
consolidated financial statements for a description of
ArcelorMittal guarantees for associates and joint ventures of
$3.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. ArcelorMittal’s debt
facilities have provisions whereby the acceleration of the
debt of another borrower within the ArcelorMittal group
could, under certain circumstances, lead to acceleration
under such facilities.

The following table summarizes the repayment schedule of
ArcelorMittal’s outstanding indebtedness, which includes
short-term and long-term debt, as of December 31, 2019.

ArcelorMittal’s use of financial instruments for hedging
purposes is set forth in note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Financings

ArcelorMittal’s principal credit facilities are described below,
for further information on its existing credit facilities and
several debt financing and repayment transactions
completed during 2019, please refer to note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Principal credit facilities

On December 19, 2018, ArcelorMittal signed an agreement
for a $5.5 billion revolving credit facility (the "Facility"). This
Facility replaced the $5.5 billion revolving credit facility
dated April 30, 2015, which was amended and extended on
December 21, 2016. The agreement incorporates a single
tranche of $5.5 billion and on November 27, 2019
ArcelorMittal exercised the option to extend the facility's
maturity by one year to December 19, 2024. The
commitments are $5.5 billion until December 19, 2023 and
$5.4 billion until December 19, 2024, subject to
ArcelorMittal’s option to extend the term by an additional
year exercisable in the end of 2020. The Facility may be
used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31,
2019, the $5.5 billion revolving credit facility was fully
available. The Company makes drawdowns from and
repayments on this Facility in the framework of its cash
management.

On September 30, 2010, ArcelorMittal entered into the $500
million revolving multi-currency letter of credit facility (the
“Letter of Credit Facility”). The Letter of Credit Facility is
used by the Company and its subsidiaries for the issuance
of letters of credit and other instruments. The terms of the
letters of credit and other instruments contain certain
restrictions as to duration. The Letter of Credit Facility was

amended on October 26, 2012 and September 30, 2014 to
reduce its amount to $450 million and to $350 million,
respectively. On July 31, 2019, the Company refinanced its
Letter of Credit Facility by entering into a $350 million
revolving multi-currency letter of credit facility, which
matures on July 31, 2022.

Mandatory convertible bond

Please refer to note 6.3 and 11.2 to the consolidated
financial statements.

True sale of receivables (“TSR”) programs and payment
terms with suppliers

The Company has established a number of programs for
sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable to
various financial institutions (referred to as true sale of
receivables (“TSR’”)). As of December 31, 2019, the total
amount of trade accounts receivables sold amounted to
$4,436 million. Through the TSR programs, certain
operating subsidiaries of ArcelorMittal surrender the control,
risks and benefits associated with the accounts receivable
sold; therefore, the amount of receivables sold is recorded
as a sale of financial assets and the balances are removed
from the consolidated statements of financial position at the
moment of sale.

As part of the Company’s ongoing efforts to improve its
working capital position, it continually engages with its
customers and suppliers with the aim of improving overall
terms, including pricing, quality, just in time delivery,
discounts and payment terms. Trade accounts payable have
maturities from 15 to 180 days depending on the type of
material, the geographic area in which the purchase
transaction occurs and the various contractual agreements.
The Company's average outstanding number of trade
payable days amounted to 78 over the last 5 years. The
ability of suppliers to provide payment terms may be
dependent on their ability to obtain funding for their own
working capital needs and or their ability to early discount
their receivables at their own discretion. Given the nature
and large diversification of its suppliers base the Company
does not expect any material impact to its own liquidity
position as a result of suppliers not having access to
liquidity. As of December 31, 2019, a 5 day reduction in
trade payable days would result in a trade payables
decrease by $750 million.

40 Management report

Earnings distribution

ArcelorMittal held 9.8 million shares in treasury as of
December 31, 2019, as compared to 8.3 million shares as
of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the
number of shares held by the Company in treasury
represented approximately 0.96% of the Company's total
issued share capital.

On January 31, 2018, the Company announced that the
Board had agreed on a new dividend policy which was
approved by the shareholders at the annual general
meeting of shareholders in May 2018. Given the current de-
leveraging focus, dividends began at $0.10/share in 2018
(paid from 2017 results). The Company intends to
progressively increase the base dividend paid to its
shareholders, and, on attainment of the net debt target,
return a percentage of net cash provided by operating
activities annually. The Company paid the base dividend for
2019 (paid from 2018 earnings) of $0.20 per share to the
shareholders. On February 4, 2020, given the resilient cash
flow and progress towards its net debt target, the Board
proposes a base dividend of $0.30 per share for 2020 (in
respect of 2019) which will be proposed to the shareholders
at the AGM in May 2020.

Pension/OPEB liabilities

The defined benefit liabilities for employee benefits
increased by $0.4 billion to $7.3 billion as of December 31,
2019, as compared to $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2018.
The increase is mainly due to the increase in the defined
benefit obligation due to lower discount rates, offset partly
by increase in assets value and other actuarial gains. For
additional information with respect to the Company’s
pension plan and OPEB liabilities, including a breakdown by
region and by type of plan, see note 8.2 to the consolidated
financial statements.

IFRS 16

The Company adopted IFRS 16 “Leases” as of January 1,
2019, using the modified retrospective transition approach
with right-of-use assets measured at an amount equal to the
lease liability recognized at January 1, 2019, adjusted by
the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments
relating to those leases. On January 1, 2019, the Company
recognized additional lease liabilities (discounted at the
incremental borrowing rates at that date) for an amount of
$1,136 million (see note 7 to the consolidated financial

Sources and uses of cash

Years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017

The following table presents a summary of cash flow of ArcelorMittal:

Management report 41

Summary of cash flow

For the year ended December 31,

(in $ millions) 2019 2018 2017
Net cash provided by operating activities 6,017 4,196 4,563
Net cash used in investing activities (3,824) (3,759) (2,830)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 514 (689) (1,731)

Net cash provided by operating activities

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided
by operating activities increased to $6.0 billion, as
compared with $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31,
2018. The increase in net cash provided by operating
activities was mainly due to an operating working capital
release of $2.2 billion as compared to an operating working
capital investment of $4.4 billion in 2018, including an inflow
for inventories of $2.47 billion , an inflow for trade accounts
receivables of $0.96 billion, partially offset by an outflow of
trade accounts payables of $1.24 billion. The operating
working capital release was driven by lower inventories and
receivables, due in part to lower selling prices, particularly in
the fourth quarter of 2019, as well as by raw material costs
and improved collection of receivables.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided
by operating activities decreased to $4.2 billion, as
compared with $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31,
2017. The decrease in net cash provided by operating
activities was mainly due to an investment in operating
working capital of $4.38 billion which represented an outflow
for trade accounts receivables of $0.65 billion, an outflow for
inventories of $4.65 billion and an inflow for trade accounts
payables and other of $0.91 billion, partially offset by an
increase in operating income driven by the increase in
average steel selling prices offset by lower steel shipments.
The operating working capital investment for the year ended
December 31, 2018 largely reflected the price effect of
improved market conditions which impacted operating
working capital through higher inventories and higher trade
receivables. The investment in operating working capital for
the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected a lower than
anticipated release of working capital in the fourth quarter of
2018 due to the weaker apparent demand conditions
leading to an accumulation of metal stock and raw material
volumes.

Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Capital
expenditures increased to $3.6 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2019 as compared to $3.3 billion for the year

ended December 31, 2018. Capital expenditures for the
year ended December 31, 2019 were significantly below the
initial guidance of $4.3 billion but marginally above the
revised $3.5 billion guidance provided after the third quarter
of 2019 and below the mid-year guidance of $3.8 billion as
the Company adapted its capital expenditure plans to the
weaker market conditions. Cash used in investing activities
includes i) $0.8 billion net cash outflow for the acquisition of
AMNS India and $83 million additional UG payments, ii)
lease payments ($200 million) for the ArcelorMittal Italia
acquisition and iii) the acquisition of Minker Metallprofile
GmbH in Germany ($46 million) . These outflows were
offset in part by i) proceeds from remedy asset sales for the
ArcelorMittal Italia acquisition of $518 million (cash
consideration of $694 million, net of cash disposed of $34
million, an escrow deposit of $125 million which was
subsequently drawn and proceeds of $17 million paid to a
joint venture of the Company), ii) the final installment of
disposal proceeds from ArcelorMittal USA's 21% stake in
the Empire Iron Mine Partnership for $44 million and iii) the
sale of remaining 2.6% stake in Gerdau for $116 million.
See “—Capital expenditure projects”.

Net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.8 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2017. Capital
expenditures increased to $3.3 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.8 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2017. Capital expenditures for the
year ended December 31, 2018 were lower than expected
due to underspending in certain strategic projects and at
ArcelorMittal Italia due to the acquisition only being
completed in November 2018. Cash used in investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 included
the acquisition of the Uttam Galva and KSS Petron debt for
$1 billion in the context of the AMNS India bidding process,
offset in part by the proceeds from the sale of Go Steel
Frydek Mistek ($39 million), the second installment of
proceeds of $44 million from the disposal of ArcelorMittal
USA's 21% stake in the Empire Iron Mining Partnership,
$220 million of sale proceeds following the disposal of the
Company's 50% interest in Macsteel and $55 million
relating to the release of restricted cash related to the
mandatory convertible bond following contractual
renegotiation.

Net cash provided by financing activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.5 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the net
cash used in financing activities of $0.7 billion in 2018. In
2019, net cash provided by financing activities included an
inflow of $1.3 billion net proceeds (proceeds of $6.4 billion
offset by payments of $5.1 billion) for short and long-term
debt, partially offset by dividends of $332 million, a $90
million outflow related to the share buyback program and
$326 million net outflows from lease payments and other
financing activities. The 2019 cash outflows for lease
payments and other financing activities increased as a
result of the first-time application of IFRS 16 effective from
January 1, 2019, as the repayments of the principal portion
of the operating leases are presented under financing
activities (previously reported under operating activities).
For further details related to capital markets, liability
management transactions and debt repayments in 2019,
see note 6.1.2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Net cash used in financing activities was $0.7 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.7 billion
in 2017. In 2018, $0.2 billion net payments for short and
long-term debt included mainly $0.6 billion of bonds
repurchased pursuant to cash tender offers, $0.9 billion
repayment at maturity of the euro denominated Floating
Rate Notes due April 9, 2018 and the remaining amount of
the euro denominated 4.5% Notes due March 29, 2018
partly offset by $1 billion drawing under the $7 billion term
facility with respect to the UG and KSS Petron payments.
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2018 also included dividend payments of

$220 million and $226 million outflow related to the share
buyback program. Net cash used by financing activities for
the year ended December 31, 2017 included net payments/
proceeds for short and long-term debt of $1.5 billion. Net
cash used by financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2017 included $1.2 billion of bonds
repurchased pursuant to cash tender offers, $0.6 billion
repayment at maturity of the euro denominated 4.625%
Notes, $0.6 billion used to early redeem the 6.125% Notes
due June 1, 2018 and $1.0 billion used to early redeem the
9.85% Notes due June 1, 2019, offset in part by a new $0.4
billion Schuldschein loan, a $0.4 billion loan from the
European Investment Bank, $0.3 billion drawdown on the
4.5 billion South African rand revolving borrowing base
finance facility and $0.6 billion proceeds from the issuance
of euro denominated 0.95% Notes due January 17, 2023.

Dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2019
were $332 million, including $203 million paid to
ArcelorMittal shareholders and $129 million paid to non-
controlling shareholders in subsidiaries. Dividends paid
during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $220
million, including $101 million paid to ArcelorMittal
shareholders and $119 million paid to non-controlling
shareholders in subsidiaries.

Equity

Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent
decreased to $38.5 billion at December 31, 2019, as
compared to $42.1 billion at December 31, 2018, primarily
due to the net loss attributable to the equity holders of the
parent of $2.5 billion and $0.3 billion actuarial losses. See
note 11 to ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent
increased to $42.1 billion at December 31, 2018, as
compared to $38.8 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily
due to net income attributable to the equity holders of the
parent of $5.1 billion and $0.6 billion actuarial gains partly
offset by $2.2 billion foreign exchange losses. See note 10
to ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2018.

Trend information

All of the statements in this “Trend Information” section are
subject to and qualified by the information set forth under
the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements”. See also "Key factors affecting results of
operations".

Outlook

Based on the current economic outlook, ArcelorMittal
expects an expansion in global ASC in 2020 by +1% to +2%
(versus growth of +1.1% in 2019). Supply chain destocking
constrained demand in ArcelorMittal's core markets,


--- Page 40 ---

particularly for flat products, and the Company estimates
that World-ex China ASC declined by 0.8% in 2019. China
had a better than expected year with ASC estimated to have
increased by 3%. Whilst acknowledging the risks and
uncertainties, ArcelorMittal believes that there are signs that
the real demand slowdown is beginning to stabilize, and the
supportive inventory environment means that the Company
is more optimistic on the apparent demand outlook for 2020.
This may be revised downwards due to the impact of the
Coronavirus outside China. By region:

- Inthe U.S., ASC is expected to grow within a range
of +0% to +1% in 2020 (versus an estimated -2%
contraction in 2019), with stronger ASC in flat
products offsetting an anticipated decline in ASC
for long products.

— In Europe, ASC is expected to grow within a range
of +1% to +2% in 2020 (versus over -4% estimated
contraction in 2019); although automotive is
expected to remain weak, the end of destocking is
expected to support improved ASC for flat
products, similarly the end of destocking should
offset the impact of the slowdown in construction
activity for long products ASC.

- In Brazil, ASC is expected to rebound in 2020 with
growth expected in the range of +4% to +5%
(versus estimated -2.6% contraction in 2019)
following the pronounced destocking of flat
products in 2019 and expected growth in
construction activity.

- Inthe CIS, ASC growth in 2020 is expected to slow
but remain positive within a range of +0% to +1%
(versus +4% estimated growth in 2019).

-—  Asaresult, overall World ex-China ASC in 2020 is
expected to grow within the range of +2% to +2.5%
(versus estimated -0.8% contraction in 2019).

-  InChina, that in 2020 both GDP and steel demand
growth are still likely to be weaker than what was
expected prior to the Coronavirus outbreak (Steel
demand now expected to grow only 0 to 1% in
2020, down from 1 to 2% previously expected).

Management report 43

The China and global ASC forecast reflects the Company's
base case view of the impact of Coronavirus. Absent a
degradation of the situation and/or a further extension of the
holiday period, the Company believes the effect of the
Coronavirus will likely have a short-term negative demand
impact in China and to a lesser degree elsewhere.
ArcelorMittal's current view is that the vast majority of the
impact on the first quarter of 2020 demand is expected to be
recovered throughout the remainder of the year and its
perspective on the fundamentals of the Chinese steel
market remain unchanged. However, the recent increase in
cases outside China is worrying and increases the risk of a
global pandemic and a much larger negative impact on
global GDP. The Company is monitoring the situation
closely and in particular in Italy, as should the virus spread
more widely through Europe this will likely have a material
impact on the Company’s sales and profitability in 2020.

The Company expects certain cash needs of the business
(consisting of capital expenditures, cash paid for interest,
cash paid for taxes, pensions and certain other cash
payments but excluding operating working capital
movements) to total $4.5 billion in 2020 versus $5.0 billion
in 2019. The Company maintains the ability to adapt its
capital expenditure plans to the operating environment and
now expects 2020 capital expenditures to be $3.2 billion
(down from $3.6 billion in 2019). Net interest expense in
2020 is expected to be $0.5 billion (versus $0.6 billion in
2019) while cash payments for taxes, pensions and other
cash payments are expected to be stable at $0.8 billion
(versus 2019).

The Company released $2.2 billion in operating working
capital in 2019 (versus an operating working capital
investment of $4.4 billion in 2018). Whilst the Company
does not at this stage want to give a firm target or specific
guidance for operating working capital needs in 2020 (due
to the fact that it is so dependent on operating conditions
towards the end of the year), should market conditions
remain at current levels then there is the potential to reduce
working capital by a further $1 billion.

As previously announced in the first half of 2019, and in line
with the Company's ongoing efforts to optimize its asset
portfolio, it identified opportunities to unlock $2 billion of
value from the portfolio over the next 2 years. The Company
has made good progress to date and has achieved ~$0.6
billion, including the sale of its stake in Gerdau ($0.1 billion)
and the sale of a 50% stake in Global Chartering Ltd which
is expected to reduce net debt in total by $0.5 billion ($0.4
billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $0.1 billion early
2020). ArcelorMittal remains engaged in active discussions
with interested parties on several additional opportunities.

Given the ongoing focus on delivering the $1 billion of
identified cost improvement plans in order to fully achieve
the Action 2020 targets, the potential for an approximate $1
billion operating working capital release assuming market


--- Page 41 ---

44 Management report

conditions remain at current levels, together with further
progress on portfolio optimization efforts, the Company is
optimistic that it can achieve its $7.0 billion net debt
objectives by year end 2020 which would provide strong
foundations for improved shareholder returns going forward.

ArcelorMittal intends to progressively increase the base
dividend paid to its shareholders, and, given the resilient
cash flow and progress towards its net debt target, the
Board proposes a base dividend of $0.30 per share for 2020
(in respect of 2019) which will be proposed to the
shareholders at the AGM in May 2020.

Disclosures about market risk

ArcelorMittal is exposed to a number of different market
risks arising from its normal business activities. Market risk
is the possibility that changes in raw materials prices,
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, base metal
prices (zinc, nickel, aluminum and tin) and energy prices
(oil, natural gas and power) will adversely affect the value of
ArcelorMittal’s financial assets, liabilities or expected future
cash flows.

The fair value information presented below is based on the
information available to management as of the date of the
consolidated statements of financial position. Although
ArcelorMittal is not aware of any factors that would
significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such
amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for
purposes of this annual report since that date, and
therefore, the current estimates of fair value may differ
significantly from the amounts presented. The estimated fair
values of certain financial instruments have been
determined using available market information or other
valuation methodologies that require considerable judgment
in interpreting market data and developing estimates.

See note 6 to ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial
statements for quantitative information about risks relating
to financial instruments, including financial instruments
entered into pursuant to the Company’s risk management
policies.

Risk management

ArcelorMittal has implemented strict policies and procedures
to manage and monitor financial market risks.
Organizationally, supervisory functions are separated from
operational functions, with proper segregation of duties.
Financial market activities are overseen by the President
and CFO, the Corporate Finance and Tax Committee and
the CEO Office.

All financial market risks are managed in accordance with
the Treasury and Financial Risk Management Policy. These
risks are managed centrally through Group Treasury by a

group specializing in foreign exchange, interest rate,
commodity, internal and external funding and cash and
liquidity management.

All financial market hedges are governed by ArcelorMittal’s
Treasury and Financial Risk Management Policy, which
includes a delegated authority and approval framework, sets
the boundaries for all hedge activities and dictates the
required approvals for all Treasury activities. Hedging
activity and limits are monitored on an ongoing basis.
ArcelorMittal enters into transactions with numerous
counterparties, mainly banks and financial institutions, as
well as brokers, major energy producers and consumers.

As part of its financial risk management activities,
ArcelorMittal uses derivative instruments to manage its
exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange
rates and commodities prices. These instruments are
principally interest rate, currency and commodity swaps,
spots and forwards. ArcelorMittal may also use futures and
options contracts.

Counterparty risk

ArcelorMittal has established detailed counterparty limits to
mitigate the risk of default by its counterparties. The limits
restrict the exposure ArcelorMittal may have to any single
counterparty. Counterparty limits are calculated taking into
account a range of factors that govern the approval of all
counterparties. The factors include an assessment of the
counterparty’s financial soundness and its ratings by the
major rating agencies, which must be of a high quality.
Counterparty limits are monitored on a periodic basis.

All counterparties and their respective limits require the prior
approval of the Corporate Finance and Tax Committee.
Standard agreements, such as those published by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
(ISDA) are negotiated with all ArcelorMittal trading
counterparties.

Currency exposure

ArcelorMittal seeks to manage each of its entities’ exposure
to its operating currency. For currency exposure generated
by activities, the conversion and hedging of revenues and
costs in foreign currencies is typically performed using
currency transactions on the spot market and forward
market. For some of its business segments, ArcelorMittal
hedges future cash flows.

Because a substantial portion of ArcelorMittal’s assets,
liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar (its reporting currency),
ArcelorMittal has exposure to fluctuations in the values of
these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. These currency
fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the value of the
U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the Canadian dollar,
Brazilian real, South African rand, Argentine peso, Kazakh


--- Page 42 ---

tenge, Indian rupee, Polish zloty and Ukrainian hryvnia, as
well as fluctuations in the currencies of the other countries
in which ArcelorMittal has significant operations and/or
sales, could have a material impact on its results of
operations.

ArcelorMittal faces transaction risk, where its businesses
generate sales in one currency but incur costs relating to
that revenue in a different currency. For example,
ArcelorMittal’s non-U.S. subsidiaries may purchase raw
materials, including iron ore and coking coal, in U.S. dollars,
but may sell finished steel products in other currencies.
Consequently, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar will
increase the cost of raw materials, thereby negatively
impacting the Company's operating margins, unless the
Company is able to pass along the higher cost in the form of
higher selling prices.

Impact on net debt translation of a 10%
appreciation of the

Management report 45

ArcelorMittal faces foreign currency translation risk, which
arises when ArcelorMittal translates the financial statements
of its subsidiaries, denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar for inclusion in ArcelorMittal’s consolidated
financial statements.

The tables below illustrate the impact of an appreciation and
a depreciation of the U.S. dollar of 10% against the euro, on
the conversion of the net debt of ArcelorMittal into U.S.
dollars as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
The impact on net debt denominated in a currency different
than the euro, is computed based on historical data of how
such currency would move against the U.S. dollar when the
U.S. dollar appreciates/depreciates 10% against the euro. A
positive sign means an increase in the net debt.

Derivative instruments

ArcelorMittal uses derivative instruments to manage its
exposure to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange
rates and commodity prices. Changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations or in equity according to nature
and effectiveness of the hedge.

Derivatives used are non-exchange-traded derivatives such
as over-the-counter swaps, options and forward contracts.

For the Company's tabular presentation of information
related to its market risk sensitive instruments, please see
note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Interest rate sensitivity

Cash balances, which are primarily composed of euros and
U.S. dollars, are managed according to the short term (up to
one year) guidelines established by senior management on
the basis of a daily interest rate benchmark, primarily
through short-term currency swaps, without modifying the
currency exposure.

Interest rate risk on debt

ArcelorMittal’s policy consists of incurring debt at fixed and
floating interest rates, primarily in U.S. dollars and euros
according to general corporate needs. Interest rate and


--- Page 43 ---

46 Management report

currency swaps are utilized to manage the currency and/or
interest rate exposure of the debt.

For the Company's tabular presentation of the fair values of
its short and long term debt, please see note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Commodity price risk

ArcelorMittal utilizes a number of exchange-traded
commodities in the steel-making process. In certain
instances, ArcelorMittal is the leading consumer worldwide
of certain commodities. In some businesses and in certain
situations, ArcelorMittal is able to pass this exposure on to
its customers. The residual exposures are managed as
appropriate.

Financial instruments related to commodities (base metals,
energy, freight and emission rights) are utilized to manage
ArcelorMittal’s exposure to price fluctuations.

Hedges in the form of swaps and options are utilized to
manage the exposure to commodity price fluctuations.

For the Company's tabular presentation of information
related to its market risk sensitive instruments, please see
note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

In respect of non-exchange traded commodities,
ArcelorMittal is exposed to volatility in the prices of raw
materials such as iron ore (which is generally correlated
with steel prices with a time lag) and coking coal. This
exposure is almost entirely managed through long-term
contracts, however some hedging of iron ore exposures is
made through derivative contracts. For a more detailed
discussion of ArcelorMittal’s iron ore and coking coal
purchases, see "Raw materials”.

Key transactions and events in 2019

ArcelorMittal’s principal investments, acquisitions and
disposals, and other key events that occurred during the
year ended December 31, 2019 are summarized below.

ArcelorMittal Italia acquisition and subsequent events

On November 1, 2018, ArcelorMittal announced that AM
InvestCo completed the first part of the acquisition of
ArcelorMittal Italia (formerly Ilva) through a lease and
subsequent conditional obligation to purchase agreement
after having been granted merger clearance by the
European Commission ("EC") on May 7, 2018 on the basis
of the Company’s committed divestment package (see
below) and its fulfillment of all of the conditions precedent in
ArcelorMittal’s contract with the commissioners in the
extraordinary administration insolvency procedures of the
business units subject to the lease (the "Commissioners").
ArcelorMittal Italia's Taranto plant is Europe’s largest single
steel site and only integrated steelmaker in Italy.
ArcelorMittal Italia also has significant steel finishing
capacity in Taranto, Novi Ligure and Genova. AM InvestCo
undertook the acquisition subject to certain conditions
precedent to be satisfied by August 2023. The contractual
purchase price amounted to €1.8 billion ($2.1 billion) subject
to certain adjustments, with annual leasing costs of €180
million ($206 million) due in quarterly installments which
qualify as down payments against the purchase price. The
lease is for a minimum lease period of four years. The
acquisition included industrial capital expenditure
commitments of approximately €1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) over
a seven-year period focused on blast furnaces including
€0.2 billion revamping of blast furnace #5 intending to bring
steel production to 8 million tonnes by 2024, steel shops
and finishing lines and environmental capital expenditure
commitments of approximately €0.8 billion ($0.9 billion)
including €0.3 billion for stock pile coverage, €0.2 billion for
reduction of emissions at coke ovens and €0.2 billion in
waste water treatment. The acquisition also provided for
environmental remediation obligations of approximately €0.3
billion ($0.4 billion), the latter of which would be funded with
funds seized by the Italian Government from the former
shareholder.

According to the legal framework in force at November 1,
2018 (for a period up to August 2023), the Commissioners
and AM InvestCo were granted protection from possible
criminal liability related to environmental, health and safety
and workplace security issues at ArcelorMittal Italia’s
Taranto plant, pending the timely implementation of the
environmental investment program set forth in a Prime
Minister's Decree. In September 2017 and then August
2018, the Italian State Solicitor-General issued an opinion
confirming that the term of the protection coincided with the
term of this environmental plan, namely to August 23, 2023.
However, on November 2, 2019, the Italian Parliament
ratified a law decree previously enacted by the Italian

government, which effective November 3, 2019, removed
the legal protection necessary for AM InvestCo to implement
its environmental plan without the risk of criminal liability.

On November 4, 2019, after such law decree became
effective, AM InvestCo sent to the Commissioners a notice
to withdraw from, or terminate the lease. In addition, among
other serious occurrences independent of AM InvestCo's
will, the decisions issued by the criminal court of Taranto
binding the Commissioners to complete certain
prescriptions by December 12, 2019, a term the
Commissioners themselves deemed impossible to meet,
failing which blast furnace #2 would be shut down, also
contributed to a situation of legal and operational
uncertainty that further significantly impaired the ability to
carry out the necessary operations at ArcelorMittal Italia and
operate the Taranto plant. While the Taranto court of
appeals reversed the criminal court’s order on January 7,
2020 therefore allowing blast furnace #2 to remain open,
any potential shutdown would make it impossible for AM
InvestCo to implement its industrial plan, operate the
Taranto plant and, generally, continue to implement the
commitments described above. In its November 4, 2019
notice of withdrawal and termination, AM InvestCo asked
the Commissioners to take responsibility for ArcelorMittal
Italia’s operations and employees within 30 days from the
receipt of such notice. On November 15, 2019, the
Commissioners filed suit in a Civil Court in Milan seeking an
injunction to prevent AM InvestCo’s withdrawal from, and
termination of, the lease and require AM InvestCo to stop
the implementation of its plan to suspend the operations
and to continue the maintenance and operation of the
leased business units. The Commissioners also requested
that the court require AM InvestCo to pay €1 billion in the
event that it fails to comply with an adverse decision on the
Commissioners’ application for interim injunctions.
Moreover, following a complaint filed by the Commissioners,
in mid-November 2019 prosecutors in Milan and Taranto
opened investigations into potential violations of numerous
criminal laws. The hearing to discuss the Commissioners’
application for interim measures was originally set for
November 27, 2019, pending which AM InvestCo
suspended the implementation of its plan to suspend the
operations at ArcelorMittal Italia. Following announcements
on November 22, 2019 and November 23, 2019,
respectively, by the Italian Prime Minister’s office and AM
InvestCo that meetings had been held between the parties
to discuss potential solutions for the plants and that
discussions would continue with the aim of reaching an
agreement as soon as possible to support sustainable steel-
making in Taranto, at the hearing the court granted the
requested by the Commissioners and AM InvestCo for
postponement (to December 20, 2019) in order to allow the
development of ongoing negotiations, provided that AM
InvestCo assure the maintenance of the normal functioning
of the plants and guarantee production continuity pending
such negotiations. On December 20, 2019, ArcelorMittal


--- Page 48 ---

announced that AM InvestCo had signed a non-binding
agreement with the Commissioners that forms a basis to
continue negotiations on a new industrial plan for
ArcelorMittal Italia, including discussions on a substantial
equity investment by a government-controlled entity. The
new industrial plan would contemplate investments in green
technology, including through a new company funded by
public and private investors. In light thereof, the Civil Court
of Milan granted the parties' request to further postpone the
hearing until February 7, 2020, and on such date (given
ongoing negotiations) granted a further request to postpone
until March 6, 2020. AM InvestCo has incurred losses since
its consolidation of ArcelorMittal Italia in November 2018.
ArcelorMittal expects to continue to consolidate ArcelorMittal
Italia unless and until the control of the assets is transferred
to the Commissioners or other changes in its power over the
relevant activities or exposure to variable returns occur.

ArcelorMittal Italia acquisition related divestments

On June 30, 2019, ArcelorMittal completed the sale to
Liberty House Group ("Liberty") of several steelmaking
assets that form the divestment package the Company
agreed with the European Commission ("EC") during its
merger control investigation into the Company's acquisition
of ArcelorMittal Italia. Assets included within the divestment
package are: ArcelorMittal Ostrava (Czech Republic),
ArcelorMittal Galati (Romania), ArcelorMittal Skopje
(Macedonia), ArcelorMittal Piombino (Italy), ArcelorMittal
Dudelange (Luxembourg) and several finishing lines at
ArcelorMittal Liege (Belgium). The total net consideration
(consisting of amounts payable upon closing and
subsequently in part contingent upon certain criteria, net of
€110 million placed in escrow) for the assets payable to
ArcelorMittal was €740 million subject to customary closing
adjustments. Of this total amount, €610 million was received
on June 28, 2019. At closing, the Company deposited €110
million in escrow that were subsequently withdrawn during
the second half of 2019 and used by Liberty for certain
capital expenditure projects to satisfy commitments given in
the EC approval process. See note 2.3 to the consolidated
financial statements for further details.

AMNS India

On December 16, 2019, ArcelorMittal announced the
completion of its acquisition of AMNS India through, the
Luxembourg based joint venture it established with NSC,
which following the acquisition owns and operates AMNS.
India. ArcelorMittal holds 60% of the joint venture, with NSC
holding 40%. The acquisition occurred following the Indian
Supreme Court's ruling on November 15, 2019 approving
the Company's Resolution Plan and resolving the appeals
brought by creditors following the National Company Law
Tribunal’s initial approval on March 8, 2019 and the National
Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s further ruling on July 4,
2019.

Management report 51

AMNS India is an integrated flat steel producer, and the
largest steel company in western India. It has a crude steel
capacity of 9.6 million tonnes per year. AMNS India’s main
steel manufacturing facility is located at Hazira, Gujarat in
Western India. It also has:

-  Twoiron ore beneficiation plants close to the mines
in Kirandul and Dabuna, with slurry pipelines that
then transport the beneficiated iron ore slurry to the
pellet plants in the Kirandul-Vizag and Dabuna-
Paradeep systems;

— adownstream facility in Pune (including a pickling
line, a cold rolling mill, a galvanizing mill, a color
coating mill and a batch annealing plant); and

— seven service centers in the industrial clusters of
Hazira, Bhuj, Indore, Bahadurgarh, Chennai,
Kolkata and Pune. It has a complete range of flat
rolled steel products, including value added
products, and significant iron ore pellet capacity
with two main pellet plant systems in Kirandul-
Vizag and Dabuna-Paradeep, which have the
potential for expansion. Its facilities are located
close to ports with deep draft for movement of raw
materials and finished goods.

In terms of iron ore pellet capacity, the Kirandul-Vizag
system has 8 million tonnes of annual pellet capacity; and
the Dabuna-Paradeep system has 6 million tonnes of
annual pellet capacity, which is in the process of being
expanded to a new capacity level of 12 million tonnes. This
expansion would bring pellet capacity above AMNS India’s
own requirements and provide the opportunity to improve
operating income by fully utilizing such pellet capacity.
AMNS India's assets do not include certain assets that are
ancillary to the steel plant, such as a slurry pipeline, power
plants, port facilities and certain mines. The joint venture
partners are assessing various options to secure the
availability of such assets, including additional acquisitions
and participation in ongoing auctions, such as for the
Odisha mines, where the joint venture acquired the
Thakurani working block in February 2020.

The Resolution Plan which was approved for the acquisition
of AMNS India included an upfront payment of 42,785 crore
Indian rupees ($6.0 billion) towards AMNS India’s debt
resolution including working capital payment, with a further
8,000 crore Indian rupees ($1.1 billion) of capital injection
into AMNS India to support operational improvement,
increase production levels and deliver enhanced levels of
profitability. In December 2019, ArcelorMittal and NSC
financed the joint venture for the acquisition of AMNS India
through a combination of partnership equity of $2,253
million (of which $1,362 million for ArcelorMittal) and debt of
$3,679 million, including $2,204 million drawn by AMNS
Luxembourg (and guaranteed by the Company) under the
bridge financing, which was outstanding on December 31,


--- Page 49 ---

52 Management report

2019, and a $1,475 million via a shareholder loan from
NSC. On February 10, 2020, in order to complete the $840
million follow-on equity funding of AMNS India, NSC
provided a $325 million shareholder loan and an additional
$475 million was drawn under the bridge financing by AMNS
Luxembourg (and guaranteed by the Company). The
outstanding amount under the bridge financing as of such
date was $3,046 million. See note 2.4.1 to the consolidated
financial statements. In connection with the execution of the
Resolution Plan, the Company had provided a $0.6 billion
performance guarantee, which was terminated on
December 31, 2019.

In connection with the acquisition of AMNS India, the
hedging programs that ArcelorMittal had entered into,
including non deliverable forwards and non deliverable
options for a nominal amount of $5.9 billion in order to
hedge the volatility between the Indian rupee and U.S.
dollar, resulted in cash proceeds of $360 million which were
contributed into the joint venture thus decreasing the
acquisition cost of AMNS India (see note 2.4.1 and note 6.3
to the consolidated financial statements).

In 2018, the Company had also been required to pay 7,469
crore Indian rupees (approximately $1 billion) to the
financial creditors of Uttam Galva ("the UG payments") and
KSS Petron in order that the Resolution Plan would be
eligible for consideration by ESIL's Committee of Creditors
("CoC"). ArcelorMittal had previously been a shareholder of
Uttam Galva and HSBC Trustee (C. |.) Limited, as trustee of
trusts of which Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, Mrs. Usha Mittal and
their children are the beneficiaries, had previously been a
shareholder of KSS Petron. At the time of such payment,
neither had any interest in such companies and, in
particular, the trusts and their beneficiaries did not have any
liability to KSS Petron or its creditors or other stakeholders
and hence did not benefit from such payment. In the context
of the creation of the AMNS India joint venture, the
Company transferred the UG payments to the joint venture.
ArcelorMittal and NSC financed such payments through a
combination of equity contributions into the joint venture of
$288 million and debt of $597 million, including $367 million
drawn by the joint venture on the $7 billion term facility
agreement and a $230 shareholder loan from NSC. The
payments related to KSS Petron have not been transferred.

The Resolution Plan also includes a capital expenditure
plan of 18,697 crore Indian rupees (approximately $2.6
billion) to be implemented in two stages over six years. The
first stage involves investments to increase the production
of finished steel goods sustainably to 6.5 million tonnes per
annum and includes completion of ongoing capital
expenditure projects with respect to a coke oven, second
sinter plant, third line CSP caster, Paradeep pellet plant and
Dabuna beneficiation plant. The first stage will also include
investment in maintenance to restore current assets, the
implementation of an environmental management plan and
the implementation of ArcelorMittal’s best practices on raw

material sourcing, plant operations, sales and product mix
(in particular through greater sophistication of the quality
and markets of the steel produced with a focus on
developing sales to the automotive industry), people
management and health & safety. The second stage will
involve investments to increase the production of finished
steel goods from 6.5 million tonnes per annum to 8.5 million
tonnes per annum by the end of 2024, including asset
reconfiguration and the addition of a coke oven, blast
furnace and basic oven furnace.

There is also a long-term aspiration to increase finished
steel shipments to between 12 and 15 million tonnes tonnes
through the addition of new iron and steelmaking assets, so
that AMNS India can play an active role and fully benefit
from the anticipated growth in the Indian steel industry.

AMNS India is expected to reinvest cash flows from
operations to finance its turnaraound and growth plans.

The joint venture agreement entered into between the
ArcelorMittal and NSC includes detailed provisions
regarding AMNS India’s governance and the roles and
responsibilities of ArcelorMittal and NSC as joint venture
partners for the operation of the business and the
implementation of the Resolution Plan. Pursuant to this
agreement, the AMNS India business shall be managed by
a board of directors consisting of six directors, three of
which will be appointed by ArcelorMittal and three appointed
by NSC. It also provides for provisions related to the
selection of the management team by the joint venture
partners. Aditya Mittal, President and CFO of ArcelorMittal,
has been appointed as the chairman of the board of AMNS
India and Dilip Oommen has been appointed its CEO.

AMNS India is accounted for under the equity method as
from the acquisition date. See note 2.4.1 to the consolidated
financial statements for further details.

Other events in 2019

During 2019, ArcelorMittal completed several debt financing
and repayment transactions. See "Liquidity and capital
resources—Financings” and note 6.1.2 to the consolidated
financial statements for a summary of the transactions.

On May 6, 2019, ArcelorMittal announced its intention to
temporarily idle production at its steelmaking facilities in
Krakow, Poland, reduce production in Asturias and Spain. In
addition, the planned increase of shipments at ArcelorMittal
Italia to a six million tonne annual run-rate was slowed down
following a decision to optimize cost and quality over
volume in this environment. Together, these actions resulted
in a temporary annualized production reduction of around
three million tonnes. On May 29, 2019, the Company
announced its decision to take additional steps to adjust its
European production levels to further align its production to
the current market demand by a further 1.2 million tonnes to


--- Page 50 ---

take total annualized productions cuts to 4.2 million tonnes
in the second half of 2019. As a result, it:

+ Reduced primary steelmaking production
at its facilities in Dunkirk, France and
Eisenhittenstadt, Germany;

+ Reduced primary steelmaking production
at its facility in Bremen, Germany in the
fourth quarter of 2019, where a planned
blast furnace stoppage for repair works
were extended; and

+ Extended the stoppage planned in the
fourth quarter of 2019 to repair a blast
furnace at its plant in Asturias, Spain.

These actions were taken in light of difficult operating
conditions in Europe with a combination of weakening
demand, rising imports, high energy costs and rising carbon
costs. Such conditions, along with high iron ore prices, have
persisted since the Company's announcement of these
measures.

On July 16, 2019, the Company sold its 30 million shares,
representing a stake of 2.6% of preferred shares, held in its
investment Gerdau, an equity instrument at fair value
through other comprehensive income, for $116 million. See
note 2.5 to the consolidated financial statements.

In recent periods, the performance of ArcelorMittal South
Africa has been challenged by increased electricity, port and
rail regulated costs, and uncompetitive raw material
sourcing as well as the ongoing weak economic backdrop in
South Africa. ArcelorMittal South Africa has undertaken an
intensive review of its business focused on cash
preservation and cost reduction through an expanded
Business Transformation Program. At the same time, a
strategic asset footprint review was launched to establish an
asset base with an enduring competitive advantage to
ensure the long-term sustainability of ArcelorMittal South
Africa. Following this review, a large-scale employee
reorganization (over 1000 employees) has been finalized
with an additional repricing and rescoping of sub-contractor
services expected by the end of the first quarter of 2020.
During the first phase of the asset review, it has been
agreed to orderly and commercially wind-down the
Saldanha Works. The process is progressing according to
plan and is anticipated to be largely completed by the end of
the first quarter of 2020. The second phase of the Asset
Review commenced in November 2019, focusing on
Newcastle Works and certain of the long steel products
rolling facilities in Pretoria and Vereeniging. The objective of
this phase of the review is to sustainably improve these
operations’ structural cost position and service offerings.
The closure of significant long steel product plants is not
anticipated in the near future, and notably, primary steel
making operations will continue in the short-term at

Management report 53

Newcastle Works, although it will now be focused on
primarily serving the domestic and Africa Overland markets.
Significant organizational configuration opportunities have
been identified to improve both operational effectiveness
and controllable cost competitiveness of not only the long
steel product business, but that of ArcelorMittal South Africa
overall.

On December 23, 2019, ArcelorMittal announced that it
signed a share purchase agreement with DryLog Ltd
("DryLog") for the sale of a controlling 50% stake in Global
Chartering Limited ("Global Chartering"), its wholly owned
shipping business, and subsequently formed a 50:50
shipping joint venture with DryLog. Accordingly,
ArcelorMittal's remaining 50% interest is accounted for
under the equity method. Global Chartering operates 28 dry
cargo vessels, which range from Supramax to Cape Size,
25 of which are on long-term leases and have been
transferred into the joint venture, with the remaining 3 being
owned outright. The joint venture will benefit from the
combination of the two businesses respective knowledge
and expertise, and ArcelorMittal’s extensive annual cargo
commitments, a portion of which will be handled exclusively
by this joint venture. It will also benefit from DryLog's ability
to optimize transport solutions and its technical and
commercial vessel management expertise. These factors
are expected to enable the joint venture to grow its
operations and become a significant player in the
international shipping industry. The transaction decreases
ArcelorMittal’s net debt by $0.5 billion, with a decrease in
debt of $0.4 billion at December 31, 2019 (resulting from a
derecognition of lease liabilities in this amount) and a further
$0.1 billion decrease in early 2020 (following the completion
of a sale-and-lease back of the 3 vessels owned by Global
Chartering) and is part of ArcelorMittal’s commitment to
unlock up to $2 billion of value from its asset portfolio by
mid-year 2021. The transaction closed on December 31,
2019. See note 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements
for further information.

Recent developments

On February 27, 2020, the Mayor of Taranto adopted an
order addressed to ArcelorMittal Italia and Ilva related to
certain emissions events that appear to have occurred in
August 2019 and February 22 and 23, 2020 and that
allegedly concern the Taranto plant. The order requires
ArcelorMittal Italia to identify the responsible installations
within 30 days, to eliminate any anomalies at such
installations causing such emission events within 60 days
or, if necessary, to shut down certain installations related to
such emissions events. The Mayor of Taranto also alleges
that it did not receive adequate responses from the Italian
Ministry of the Environment with respect to such emissions
events. ArcelorMittal Italia considers the order to be
unfounded and will appeal it. Following the order, the
Ministry of the Environment requested additional information
from the Mayor of Taranto about the events (including the


--- Page 51 ---

54 Management report

type of emissions and how the events can be connected to
the Taranto plant) and has also requested information from
certain other industrial companies in Taranto, as to any
anomalies, accidents or events that may have occurred on
February 22 and 23, 2020. ArcelorMittal Italia is preparing
its responses to the request for information from the Ministry
of the Environment, which will also be provided to the Mayor
of Taranto.

Research and development. The Company's Global
Research and Development ("R&D") division provides the
technical foundation for the sustainability and commercial
success of the Company by stimulating innovative thinking
and the continuous improvement of products and
processes.

ArcelorMittal believes it possesses leading R&D capabilities
among steel producers and is committed to maintaining and
extending this advantage by anticipating and responding to
major technological, sustainability and social trends, while
also making a significant contribution towards achieving the
Company's 10 Sustainable Development Outcomes (see
“—Sustainable Development’ below).

To support this commitment, the Company operates 11
research sites around the world, and in 2019, ArcelorMittal’s
R&D expense was $301 million.

Among its R&D initiatives, ArcelorMittal has developed
expertise in Lifecycle Analysis ("LCA"), which analyzes the
environmental impact of products during their production,
use and disposal. In 2019, the Company undertook a total
of 27 LCA studies related to steel products and the
processes used to produce them, all guided by ISO
standard 14040-44.

The Company's expertise in LCA is an important asset in all
of its global markets. For example, LCA is a requirement of
Environmental Product Declarations ("EPD") for
construction products in Europe, and contributes to
increasing the Company's competitiveness in the
construction sector. The Company's EPDs are reviewed by
third parties and validated by the "Institut Bauen und
Umwelt", the Institute of Construction and Environment, and
are made available via ArcelorMittal Europe’s Constructalia
website. The Company is also leading the development of a
methodological framework for EPDs in Brazil, where it
published its first EPD in 2019.

ArcelorMittal also participates in the Worldsteel LCA expert
group and the SOVAMAT initiative (SOcial VAlue of
MATerials), an international network of experts on the social
and environmental impacts of materials. It is a member of
the CIRAIG International Lifecycle Chair, the international
reference center for the lifecycle of products, processes and
services, and is active in particular in their circular economy
working group. It is also a member of the Roundtable for
Product Social Metrics.

The Company has developed a Sustainable Innovation
("SI") tool with the ultimate goal to enable researchers to
evaluate the contribution of all new products to sustainable
development. In 2019, the SI tool has been reviewed by
third parties and an interface for industry products has been
developed.

ArcelorMittal’s R&D strategy focuses on six main pillars:

Maintaining the competitiveness of the Company’s steel
among its unique automotive customer base. R&D
continually drives innovation that enables the Company's
strategic focus on higher-added-value products. A key focus
is products designed to meet the complex and changing
needs of the automotive industry.

ArcelorMittal has developed its S-in motion® range of
solutions, which showcase the benefits of Advanced High
Strength Steel ("AHSS") grades and manufacturing
processes that help automotive customers meet demanding
new targets for fuel economy, and thereby drive
improvements in CO2 emissions.

In 2020, ArcelorMittal will celebrate the 40" year
anniversary of S-in Motion®. This concept has proven to
adapt to the evolving needs of the automotive market, with
its most recent developments in 2019 including a catalog of
solutions for the booming electrified vehicles market. The
Company's S-in Motion® projects for Hybrid vehicles,
Battery Electric Vehicles ("BEVs") and battery packs are
now available for roll out to customers.

The results of the ArcelorMittal S-in motion® BEV study
completed in 2019 on a Sports Utility Vehicle demonstrate
why steel is expected to remain the dominant auto body
metal for the growing electrified vehicle market. Steel will
allow original equipment manufacturers to achieve the goals
of creating more light weight vehicles with increased driving
ranges in a more cost-effective manner. More than ever,
steel is the material of choice for automotive customers as it
combines the ability to meet stringent expectations for
passenger safety with the best price on the market.

With total life cycle emissions of BEVs expected to
decrease compared to internal combustion engine vehicles,
BEVs’ embedded carbon from metal production and its end-
of-life impacts will become increasingly relevant. A
comprehensive LCA study encompassing the vehicle’s
production and end-of-life phases has been made on the
company's S-in motion® BEV. It concludes that while light-
weighting still improves BEVs’ life cycle performance, gains
in powertrain efficiency will have much greater benefits. The
most sensitive aspects of BEVs’ life cycle are the
environmental footprint of battery production and that of the
electricity grid. Current battery production impacts are
greater than those of steel body production. For BEVs to
reach legislated CO2 targets, the electricity grid needs to be
decarbonized much more quickly. Between 2000 and 2015,


--- Page 52 ---

the grid decarbonized at a rate of 2%. For large cars to
meet CO2 targets, progress will need to triple between 2020
and 2035.

Creating a robust and diverse portfolio of niche non-
automotive steel products to serve customers across
multiple sectors. Customers in many sectors share the
automotive industry's demand for innovative products and
processes. The Company aims to deliver similar
breakthrough advances in these sectors by creating
differentiated products and unique engineering solutions, all
designed to ensure that steel is the customer's material of
choice.

ArcelorMittal is developing innovative solutions for the
energy segment, both renewable and conventional. It has
innovated steel for wind turbines, and its patented anti-
corrosion steel coating Magnelis® is used extensively in
framing solutions for photovoltaic modules. The Company’s
pioneering technology for electrical steels also benefits this
market.

Packaging is, in the Company's view, another important
opportunity. ArcelorMittal continues to respond to the need
to meet evolving health and safety regulations, to achieve
lightweight, cost-saving design, and to develop new
functionalities. A major opportunity is also presented by the
increasing pressure to reduce packaging made of plastics,
as society becomes less and less accepting of packaging
that is not in line with sustainable development objectives.
With its ability to be recycled and to eliminate hazardous
elements, steel is well-positioned to extend its applications
in packaging and replace an increasing volume of plastic
packaging.

In 2019, R&D launched 11 new products and solutions to
accelerate sustainable lifestyles, while also progressing
further on 16 such product development programs.

The R&D division also launched 31 products and solutions
this year to support sustainable construction, infrastructure
and energy generation, while also progressing further on 17
such product development programs.

Fully capitalizing on the capacity of Steligence® - a
holistic platform for environmentally-friendly, cost-
effective construction - to create higher-added-value
products and solutions for the construction market.
Construction is one of the key sectors for ArcelorMittal. The
Company’s R&D effort is focused on providing higher-
added-value products that meet customer needs, including
their sustainable development objectives.

In 2018, ArcelorMittal launched Steligence® to highlight the
innovations the Company’s steel has to offer in the design
and performance of a building, and to support its customers
in their use of its products. Steligence® adds value through
its holistic approach of helping specialist architectural and
engineering disciplines meet the increasing demand for

Management report 55

sustainability, flexibility, creativity and cost in high-
performance building design by harnessing the credentials
of steel through its potential for recyclability and the
reduction of materials used.

Akey concept within Steligence® is to make buildings easier
to assemble and dismantle. As a result, buildings become
quicker to construct, leading to significant efficiencies and
cost savings while also creating the potential for re-use.
This reflects ArcelorMittal’s wider interest in modularization
and the potential re-use of steel components - a field it is
discussing with customers and in its LCA assessments. The
approach is demonstrated in the Company’s planned new
Luxembourg headquarters, which has been designed so
that nearly all the steel components can be dismantled and
re-used in a new building without the need for recycling.

Developing breakthrough process innovations to
deliver cost reduction, sustainability benefits to meet
current and emerging environmental challenges, and
new product development. The creation of unique
processes creates value for the Company and its
stakeholders by: enhancing the performance of operations
through cost efficiency and improved product quality;
promoting process-driven product development; and
enabling environmental improvements, including carbon
reductions and improvements in air, land and water.
Process improvements contribute decisively to the future of
the Company, both helping to preserve its license to operate
and ensuring its financial sustainability through important
management gains.

By-products and circular economy. Work in this area
includes the re-use of slag as a valuable product for many
applications, which reduces waste while avoiding the
ecosystem disruption that can result from the extraction of
other materials such as natural stone or sand. For example,
the Company is making innovative re-use of slag in the
following applications: ballast in offshore wind turbine
foundations to replace natural ballast; a construction
material for building protection walls to reduce noise and
dust; a fertilizer source for agriculture; and the potential re-
use of slag from furnaces in water filtration and greenhouse
gas capture. Other circular economy initiatives include:
working on the use of mining tailings as a secondary raw
material, either by finding marketable solutions or
generating valuable products to be used in-house; and
improving the quality of the scrap the Company uses, as
well as exploring automated sorting processes for treating
scrap.

Improvement in air, land, water. Work in this area includes
research in technology for cleaning fumes from stacks,
reducing dust diffusive emissions, cleaning water
discharges, and solving water scarcity issues.

In 2019, the research on cleaning fumes was extended to
investigate a holistic combination of technologies for

multipollutant abatement (of dust, SOx, NOx and dioxins)
with great success, and significant progress was made on
developing improved pleated bags for boosting filters
efficiency. Technology on desalination has been
implemented at Tubarao, leading to an international award
for the most innovative desalination project in 2019 by
International Desalination Association. Also in 2019, an
industrial demonstrator for waste water from Blast Furnace
treatment was launched at Asturias, along with an
innovative technology to reduce dust emissions in the
chutes transfer with very high efficiency that was validated.

Reductions of carbon emissions and energy use.
ArcelorMittal’s global R&D division also continues to
research processes to support carbon neutrality and energy
efficiency. In 2019, significant progress was made in the
concept development and engineering of a full Hy MIDREX
direct reduction process, and of a pilot plant in Hamburg for
cold electrolysis of iron, which will be operational in 2022.
Assessment through simulation and experiments of several
CO2 reduction technologies has led to the creation of
breakthrough projects that should allow the substantial
reduction of blast furnace route CO2 emissions. Meanwhile,
the roll-out of in-house developed solutions, such as smart
oxygen sensors and innovative combustion control
strategies, is enabling incremental reductions in energy and
CO2 emissions.

The Company's Jet Vapor Deposition ("JVD") technology is
an example of process-driven product development, which
enables advanced steels for industry. The Company
introduced its unique JVD line to create a new generation of
coated products with improved quality and enhanced
functionality (Jetgal® for automotive applications and
Jetskin® for industrial applications).

Mining process improvements. Global R&D has developed
the capabilities to upgrade and digitalize its systems using
satellites, drones, wireless sensors and robots to feed a
geographic information system for detailed monitoring of
tailings dams, which forms part of the Company’s mining
circular economy initiative. In the future, this will be
extended to both plants and wildlife, thus helping the
Company respond to increasing expectations from
stakeholders looking for reassurance that biodiversity
hotspots are not negatively impacted by the Company’s
mining operations.

Fully capitalizing on opportunities from the digital
economy. ArcelorMittal envisages itself as a fully digital
enterprise where everything is connected. ArcelorMittal
invested early and significantly in automation systems, and
for decades the Company has been a pioneer in the
introduction and use of artificial neural networks.
ArcelorMittal is currently fully committed to a total digital
transformation, including significant advances in a number
of fields and relies on the secure and reliable performance
of its digital technology platforms, information technology

systems, continuously updating its security measures to
avoid data breaches or data theft (see also “Risks related to
the global economy and the mining and steel industry”). The
Company is focusing its efforts on:

+ Global platforms (Big Data, IloT, Deep Learning
developments);

+ Manufacturing digitalization (Production, Quality and
Maintenance); and

. Business digitalization (Procurement, Commercial,
Supply Chain, Strategy, Finance).

The Company's global standard platform for Big Data
storage and analytics (ARTHUR) and IloT (DASHIELL)
avoids the use of a mosaic of technologies and facilitates
the global sharing and rapid implementation of Artificial
Intelligence ("Al") models with proven results among all
units. This approach makes the Company's size a key
advantage.

In its digital strategy, the Company makes use of solutions
that are directly acquired in the market, solutions that are
co-developed with technology suppliers, and solutions that
are fully developed internally to take advantage of the rich
knowledge interfaces the Company has (process, product,
Al). This combination leads to performance superiority.

The main driver for digitalization at ArcelorMittal is
competitive advantage, with new technologies and
especially cutting-edge Al and mathematical optimization
tools contributing to ensure:

+ The best product quality, through better prediction using
advanced analytics made possible through Big Data
and distributed computing. This means production
issues can be detected before they happen, enabling
adjustments to be made to production parameters to
avoid them.

+ Maximizing equipment operational time and avoiding
unplanned stoppages via predictive maintenance. The
Company is already seeing positive results in several
production units in Brazil, Spain and Belgium, and is
deploying this solution across the Company.

+ Cost efficiency in production and logistics. For example,
R&D has developed a unique, breakthrough technology
for line scheduling - inspired by studying and mimicking
the movements in ant colonies - that has significantly
improved productivity. In addition, the deployment of
automated stockyards, linked to line scheduling and
transport devices such as autonomous cranes, means
less stock is needed and lead times are cut, yielding
two major supply chain benefits.

While the implementation of large-scale digital and industry
4.0 projects is challenging in a company of ArcelorMittal’s
size, once implemented these projects bring major benefits


--- Page 54 ---

and value because of the Company’s scale and complexity.
The global standard platforms strategy has contributed
significantly to this initiative.

ArcelorMittal is also working with leading universities in the
USA, Canada, Spain, the UK, Germany, Belgium and
France to capture the best scientific expertise and fully
industrialize new ideas and emerging academic theories.
The Company also establishes partnerships with start-up
companies, working on fields such as Big Data analytics,
predictive maintenance, supercomputing and manufacturing
intelligence. ArcelorMittal’s approach is to work with a broad
range of entities, thus maximizing the knowledge
transference into its teams, avoiding black-boxes, and
increasing its development capabilities. This has led to the
development of new algorithms using Big Data technologies
that can solve problems in ways that were not possible
before, mainly due to limitations in the manipulation of large
volumes of data.

Seizing the potential of additive manufacturing.
ArcelorMittal sees significant potential in additive
manufacturing and 3D printing. For example, within the
Company's operations, it will be possible to ‘print’ spare
parts when predictive analytics show that equipment needs
replacing, thus reducing disruptions. As 3D technology
matures, it will have an increasing impact on the way the
Company and its customers do business. ArcelorMittal’s
R&D teams are exploring opportunities and partnering in
this field.

Sustainable development

ArcelorMittal recognizes the important contribution its
products and processes make to Sustainable Development
(“SD”) and aims to ensure that its steels are the material of
choice in the transition towards a circular and low-carbon
economy. This means preparing for and responding to the
most significant long-term environmental and social trends
that are transforming the context in which the Company
operates. These include sector-focused decarbonization
ambitions aligned with the Paris Agreement, the
transformation of society towards a circular economy and
the growing demand from customers for adherence to
sustainability standards from their entire supply chains, from
mine sites to delivery of products.

The Company's SD framework, launched in 2015, sets out
the 10 SD outcomes it needs to achieve in order to protect
and grow long-term value for its stakeholders. These
outcomes are aligned with, and aim to contribute to, many
of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals
(“SDGs"). Details of the relationship between the 10 SD
outcomes and the SDGs are included in the reporting index
to ArcelorMittal's Integrated Annual Review 2018, which is
available on the Company's website. The outcomes provide
the basis for engaging the Company’s workforce on SD

Management report 57

issues, and support the development, management and
reporting of sustainability across its operations.

ArcelorMittal's 10 SD Outcomes:

Safe, healthy, quality working lives for ArcelorMittal’s
people

Products that accelerate more sustainable lifestyles

Efficient use of resources and high recycling rates

Trusted user of air, land and water

Responsible energy user that helps create a lower-

A pipeline of talented scientists and engineers for
9 |tomorrow

ArcelorMittal’s contribution to society measured,
10 | shared and valued

To drive its goal of inventing smarter steels for a better
world, the Company recognizes the value in creating an
integrated marketing offer that combines many aspects of
these 10 SD outcomes. These include being the supplier of
choice for innovative products while maintaining steel and
mine sites that operate to standards that meet and exceed
the sustainability expectations of customers and investors.
This is at the heart of the Company's approach to SD.

ArcelorMittal listens carefully to stakeholders, both locally
and globally, and recognizes a trend of rising expectations
among stakeholders regarding local community issues as
well as the global transition toward a circular economy and
the steel industry's critical role within it. The Company
assesses stakeholder trust to be a key value driver, and
accordingly adopts a Board-led strategic approach to
deepening trust through stakeholder engagement.

Integration of SD into the business is therefore essential for
ArcelorMittal to achieve long-term value for its shareholders
and other stakeholders while maintaining a profitable market
share. Over the last four years since the Company launched
the 10 SD outcomes in 2015, it has been integrating them
into the business, beginning at the site level by explaining
the need for integrating SD into planning and reporting of
results. In 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors
established the Appointments, Remuneration & Corporate
Governance and Sustainability Committee of the Board (the
"ARCGS"), an expansion of the previous Appointments,
Remuneration & Corporate Governance Committee, which
monitors the performance of corporate functions and
business segments against the 10 SD outcomes pursuant to
the five management themes discussed below. This
integration of SD was fully embedded in 2019 with the
implementation of theme dashboards and quarterly
reporting from local sites to the board-level.


--- Page 55 ---

58 Management report

The ARCGS organizes its governance of SD through five
management themes, which helps deepen the Company’s
strategic approach towards each one.

The themes (and the relevant SD outcomes to which they
relate) are:

Management Theme Relevant SD Outcome

1 |Safety 1

2 |Climate change 6

3 |Customer reassurance |7

4 |Environment 4,5

5 |Social 1,8, 9,10

The ARCGS's oversight underpins the Company's strategy
to ensure that both corporate functions and business
segments contribute to achieving the 10 SD outcomes with
the following elements:

+ Each business segment, acting on its understanding of
SD trends and through its engagement with
stakeholders, develops a plan in pursuit of the 10 SD
outcomes as a priority, with a set of key performance
indicators (“KPls") established against which they must
report quarterly to the ARCGS committee;

+ Corporate functions lead on key areas including:
progress towards low-carbon steelmaking, innovating
steel solutions and steelmaking technologies with a
positive SD impact, and developing a ‘mine to metal’
chain of assurance against multi-stakeholder
environmental and social standards; and

+ Arobust articulation of the Company's approach and
progress through clear narrative and transparent, third-
party assured reporting.

The Company is committed to transparency as evidenced
by the comprehensive SD disclosures made in the
Integrated Annual Review and Factbook each year, and by
the publication of its first stand-alone Climate Action Report
in May 2019, which serves as the Company’s response to
the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”).

The Company now sees the need to go beyond
transparency and invest in stakeholder dialogue by leading
collaborative conversations with stakeholders on climate
action and multi-stakeholder standard setting processes and
certification for both steel sites and mines (see
“Management Theme #3: Customer reassurance" below).

The Company's management of SD is summarized along
the five management themes in the following pages.

Management Theme #1: Safety

ArcelorMittal's employees are essential to its ambition to
build a high-performing organization. The Company wants

all its employees to be safe and healthy, committed to
ArcelorMittal's success and to act with integrity in everything
they do. ArcelorMittal aims to build an inclusive culture in
which diversity is valued, and every individual is respected
and their potential developed. Safety is the number one
priority.

Safety

The Company-wide safety program, “Journey to Zero”, was
introduced in 2007. It aims to achieve zero fatalities and
severe lost-time injuries by creating a culture of shared
vigilance in which risks and hazards are understood and
monitored, best practices are shared, and appropriate
action is taken at every level. The Company's remuneration
policy links 10% of the bonuses of its leadership - from
managers to the CEO - to safety KPIs (i-e., fatalities, LTIFR
(defined below), PSIF (defined below)) in the business
where he or she works, where relevant. The Company
works with trade unions to drive safety improvements
through a global partnership, which includes joint local
Health and Safety Committees at every production unit and
a Global Health and Safety Committee (“GHSC”) which is
made up of representatives from both the trade union
IndustriALL and union members from ArcelorMittal, together
with senior ArcelorMittal managers. This is supported
internally by the ArcelorMittal Health and Safety Council.

It is with deep regret that the Company reported 21 fatalities
during 2019, including 12 in steel and 9 in mining
operations. Any fatality is a cause of great distress to
families, friends, ArcelorMittal's leadership and the entire
workforce. The Company's leadership is driving a campaign
to ensure that a culture of vigilance and mutual
accountability, in which every individual takes responsibility
for their own actions, and the actions of those around them,
prevails everywhere it operates. ArcelorMittal recognizes
that, more than improving its performance against LTIFR (as
defined below), it must work harder to ensure that its safety
culture prevents fatalities and serious incidents. During the
year, the Company implemented the following measures:

+ The Safety Leadership program in CIS (Ukraine and
Kazakhstan), training the top 100 managers and
creating the key platform from which to roll out Take
Care! training in the region. This program aims at
developing the skills of middle and upper management
to influence people's safety behavior and improve the
safety culture within their teams. It has been
successfully implemented over the past three years
across ArcelorMittal’s European operations and long
operations in Latin America, where it entered into phase
two in 2019;

+ Strengthened health and safety policy on working at
heights;


--- Page 56 ---

. Improved detection, recording, and understanding of
hazards and risks through PSIFs in order to prevent
severe incidents;

+ Improved safety leadership practices, supported by the
continuation of the Target 21 Safety Leadership
Program, where managers undertake safety training
through 21 days of 5-minute e-learning sessions ;

+ Improved communications internally across the
workforce using social media techniques; and

+ Sharing lessons within the steel industry through the
Company's participation in the Worldsteel Association.

The lost-time injury frequency rate ("LTIFR") for the
Company, defined as the number of injuries per million
hours worked that result in employees or contractors taking
time off work, was at 0.75 (1.21 including ArcelorMittal Italia)
in 2019 compared with 0.69 in 2018 (0.73 including
ArcelorMittal Italia for the last two months of 2018). The
industry average was 0.84 incidents per million hours
worked in 2018, according to the Worldsteel Association.
For comparison, ArcelorMittal recorded an LTIFR of 3.1
incidents per million hours worked in 2007, the year after
the Company's formation. The table below shows the LTIFR
by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018:

For the year
ended December 31,

Lost time injury frequency rate 2019 2018
Mining 0.97 0.61
NAFTA 0.58 0.53
Brazil 0.36 0.36
Europe 1.00* 0.93*
ACIS 0.69 0.61
Total Steel 0.73* 0.70*
Total (Steel and Mining) 0.75* 0.69*
ArcelorMittal Italia 11.13 8.20
Total (Steel and Mining) including

ArcelorMittal Italia 1.21 0.73

*Data does not include the LTIFR for Ilva (subsequently renamed
ArcelorMittal Italia) which was acquired on November 1, 2018.

Improving workers’ ability to monitor and analyze potential
severe injuries and fatalities (“PSIF"s) is also a key focus,
as it provides a deeper understanding of how safety
incidents can arise and therefore be avoided. Results show
that sites with no fatalities proactively detect and manage
twice as many PSIFs as sites that have one or more. The
volume of proactive PSIFs logged across the Company has
increased more than five times since 2016, and more than
3,500 situations have been proactively detected and
addressed this year, a 29% increase in 2019 as compared
to 2018. In addition, the Company is specifically focusing on
improving the quality of its analysis and actions, including by

Management report 59

sharing best practices across the Company, which has been
further facilitated this year through the use of the intra-
organization, social networking online tool Yammer.

PSIF is now a KPI for the Company and, alongside fatalities
and LTIFR, is reported monthly to leadership as part of the
governance process. Health and safety is reviewed by the
GHSC and overseen by the ARCGS, which meets quarterly.
When a fatality occurs, all levels of management are
informed of the circumstances and the incident is subject to
a comprehensive review process. The Company supports
sites where fatalities have occurred to ensure stronger
alignment between Group-level safety strategy and site-
level implementation.

Health

ArcelorMittal takes a proactive approach to the health of
employees and communities by partnering with local
stakeholders on initiatives which raise the level of discourse
on environmental matters and their effects on health from
stakeholder sentiment to more empirical and technical
debates necessary to find a solution to this complex issue.

For example, ArcelorMittal Tubarao signed a cooperation
agreement in 2018 worth R$3.9 million with the State of
Espirito Santo Federal University (UFES) to support their
study to identify the relationship between pollutants and
asthma cases in Vitoria, Brazil. For the next three years, 20
engineering and health specialists from UFES in Vitoria, will
develop an unprecedented study in Brazil through which
they will identify which pollutants, from particulate matters
and gases, most influence the intensifying of asthma
symptoms in children and adolescents with a goal to
generate knowledge and information to guide other
regulatory agencies in establishing maximum pollution limits
tolerable for the population, thus helping to determine
prevention policies based on qualitative data. This is
significant because ArcelorMittal Tubarao is supporting
research methods using primary data, genetics testing and
air quality testing in subjects' homes and will build trust with
its stakeholders by demonstrating it takes air pollution
seriously.

Management Theme #2: Climate change

ArcelorMittal is committed to the objectives of the Paris
Agreement and to keeping the global temperature increase
to well below 2°C. The Company's ambition is to be carbon
neutral in Europe by 2050 and to significantly reduce its
carbon emissions globally. In 2019, in response to growing
investor and customer expectations, and to align with and
exceed the recommendations of the TCFD, the Company
published its first Climate Action Report. To achieve this
goal, the Company is building a strategic roadmap linked to
the evolution of public policy and developments in low-
emissions steelmaking technologies. A target to 2030 will be
launched in 2020, replacing the Company’s current target of


--- Page 57 ---

60 Management report

an 8% carbon footprint reduction by 2020, against a 2007
baseline.

Subsequently, in December 2019 ArcelorMittal Europe
announced a CO2 roadmap to reduce emissions by 30% by
2030. The target is in line with an ambition announced in
May last year, to be carbon neutral in Europe by 2050.

The Company sees the low-carbon transition as presenting
significant opportunities as steel will remain a vital material
in the application of new industrial technologies and the
transition of the energy, transport and packaging industries,
and the future construction sector. ArcelorMittal develops
innovative products and processes that help its customers
reduce their carbon footprint in all these sectors, including
S-in motion® for automotive, Steligence® for the built
environment, and glass-granulated blast furnace slag as a
low carbon alternative for use in place of Portland cement.

The Company views steel as having many advantages in a
decarbonizing world in which demand for materials will
continue to grow. Steel is 100% recyclable without quality
loss, and in many applications, it is a lower-carbon
alternative over its lifecycle than other materials such as
aluminum and concrete. However, modeling shows that
global stocks of scrap will be insufficient to meet global
demand for steel from secondary, recycled sources for
many decades to come, so the world will continue to rely on
primary steelmaking for decades to come. Existing iron and
steelmaking processes are carbon intensive, and therefore
the route to decarbonizing steel will be through developing
new low-emissions technologies. The Company has
identified three pathways to achieving this:

* Clean power used as the energy source for hydrogen-
based ironmaking and, in the longer term, for direct
electrolysis ironmaking, and also as a contributor to
other low-emissions technologies. The Company is
building a demonstration plant in Hamburg, called
H2Hamburg, which will reduce iron ore with hydrogen.
It is also collaborating with 11 partners on a project
called Siderwin to build a three-meter industrial cell
which will test iron ore reduction via electrolysis in
Maiziéres, France.

¢ Circular carbon energy sources, including bio-based
and plastic wastes from municipal and industrial
sources and agricultural and forestry residues. Through
a process called Torero, ArcelorMittal will reduce iron
ore with waste carbon rather than fossil fuel coal in a
demonstration plant in Ghent, Belgium. Meanwhile, the
Company’s campus in Dunkirk, France is piloting the
IGAR (Injection de Gaz Réformé) project which reforms
carbon from the blast furnace, converting it into a
synthetic gas to reduce iron ore.

+ Fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (“CCS”)
enabling the continued use of existing iron and

steelmaking processes while transforming them to a
low-emissions pathway. The Carbon2Value process
captures fossil fuel carbon for storage or re-use. The
Group's Carbalyst® project, in partnership with
LanzaTech, will capture carbon gas and recycle it into
chemicals. Pilot plants for both technologies are under
construction at the Company's plant in Ghent, Belgium.
Investment in Carbalyst® started in 2018 and is
expected to be completed in 2021. the technology will
capture approximately 15% of available waste gases at
the demonstration plant and convert them into 80
million litres of ethanol annually.

These pathways could all lead to low-emissions
steelmaking. However, they pose significant challenges in
terms of new technology, expanded clean energy
infrastructure and infrastructure for the transport and
storage of CO. All three also lead to structurally higher
costs of steelmaking and therefore, for them to become a
reality, significant policy support is required.

Through its innovative low-emissions steelmaking program
(which is a multi-year budget covering the Company’s low-
carbon development and demonstration program with
partners, aimed at building industrial pilots and
demonstrations and is additional to its annual R&D
expenditure), ArcelorMittal is actively testing technologies
across each of these three pathways, and developing a
broad portfolio of breakthrough low-carbon steelmaking
processes. The Company believes that these initiatives
present significant opportunities for the decarbonization of
steelmaking provided the correct regulatory and investment
environment exists.

In the medium term, ArcelorMittal is developing an
emissions reduction roadmap to support a new global 2030
carbon target alongside its European target. However,
ArcelorMittal has also identified that its most substantial
climate-related risk stems from a policy environment that
does not enable the industry to cover the higher structural
costs that new low-emissions technologies bring.

The Company's most significant policy work is on the need
for a global framework to create a level playing field and
avoid the risk of carbon leakage. For example, carbon
border adjustments would ensure that steelmakers bearing
the structurally higher capital and operating costs of low-
emissions technology could compete with imports from
steelmakers with higher emissions. The Company is
advocating a green border adjustment in the new European
Green Deal so that Phase 4 of the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme (ETS), which requires a substantial reduction in the
carbon intensity of European steel, does not result in carbon
emissions being effectively exported from the EU to
steelmakers with higher emissions in regions where carbon
regulations are less stringent.


--- Page 58 ---

ArcelorMittal is also actively engaging in analyzes, with
customers, investors, policymakers and global think tanks,
on what policy mechanisms could be created to make low-
emissions steelmaking more competitive. For example, the
Company has been collaborating with the Energy
Transitions Commission's Mission Possible initiative on
pursuing net-zero carbon emissions from harder-to-abate
sectors, and with the Science-Based Targets initiative
(“SBT”) on the steel sector decarbonization approach.
ArcelorMittal has also been driving multi-stakeholder efforts
through ResponsibleSteel™ to develop standards on
greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) for steel.

Other global policy recommendations are:

+ Access to abundant and affordable clean energy.
Policies giving the steel industry access to abundant
and affordable renewable electricity will be key to
scaling up the clean power pathway. For acceleration of
the circular carbon pathway, the steel industry requires
priority access to biomass and waste.

+ Facilitating necessary energy infrastructure. In
addition to abundant renewable electricity, policies to
support investments in hydrogen infrastructure will be
needed to advance large-scale hydrogen-based
processes. Similarly, for the fossil fuels with CCS
pathway, policies are also important to enable and
accelerate the development of carbon transport and
storage infrastructure and services.

+ Access to sustainable finance for low-emissions
steelmaking. The scale of the challenge requires an
acceleration of technology development and roll out.
Breakthrough steelmaking technologies need to be
identified as a key priority area for public funding.

+ Accelerate transition to a circular economy.
Materials policy should divert waste streams from
landfill and incineration. It should focus on driving
recycling and reuse of all waste streams and incentivize
the use of waste streams as inputs in manufacturing
processes. It should reward products for their
reusability and recyclability.

In addition to new technologies and policy work,
ArcelorMittal’s low emissions strategy focuses on energy
efficiency in its existing steelmaking operations across the
globe, and on expanding opportunities for further steel
production using end-of-life scrap. Each year, the
Company's Investment Allocation Committee (“IAC”)
approves a number of capital investments that will bring
significant energy and carbon efficiency improvements,
enabling the Company to meet its medium-term emissions
reduction targets. In 2019, the ArcelorMittal’s IAC has
allocated a total of $711 million to 25 projects with energy
and/or carbon benefits to be spent in the next years.

Management report 61

For the third consecutive year, ArcelorMittal has won the
Steelie Award for excellence in sustainability in recognition
of the Company’s publication of the steel sector’s first
Climate Action report. Announced at the Worldsteel
Association's annual meeting in Monterrey, Mexico, the
award distinguishes the Company’s industry leadership on
sustainability amid the growing pressure steel companies
are facing to outline their approach to reducing carbon
emissions.

Management Theme #3: Customer reassurance

The Company envisions the momentum behind supply
chain accountability continuing to grow, with a particular
focus on mined raw materials. Consumer-facing brands
want to demonstrate responsible sourcing, and customers
are joining together to demand, and validate, higher
standards in their supply chains, driven by their own due
diligence processes. This is expressed through growing
demand from the Company's customers for reassurance on
environmental and social standards. As a result,
ArcelorMittal regards supply chain certification and
reassurance as a vital commercial opportunity to forge
closer links with customers and believes that taking a
leading role in multi-stakeholder engagement is one of the
most effective ways to achieve results. It is working with
peers in the steel and mining industries, and with other
stakeholders, to advance the development of new third-
party standards.

To establish a single, global standard for the entire ‘mine-to-
metal’ steel value chain, and in response to the strong trend
of rising assurance expectations from customers,
ArcelorMittal has been playing a leading role in developing
ResponsibleSteel™ since 2015. ResponsibleSteel™ is the
steel industry's only global multi-stakeholder certification
initiative, which has 40 members including steel producers,
mining companies, NGOs, steel-consuming customers,
financial institutions, and industry bodies. It enables steel
producers to prove their production processes and products
meet rigorously defined standards across a broad range of
social, environmental and ethical criteria. It also improves
responsible sourcing of the raw materials used in
steelmaking and reduces supply-chain risk.

In November 2019, following a robust accreditation process,
ResponsibleSteel™ launched its first site certification
standard. The standard presents 12 principles underpinned
by over 50 criteria and over 200 auditable requirements,
addressing: health and safety, human rights, local
communities, biodiversity and GHG among other
sustainability and assurance issues. In 2020, a full product
certification standard will follow, which will also cover the
mining of raw materials before they arrive on site, and the
full chain of custody from mine to site to final customer.

ArcelorMittal has carried out readiness assessments against
the ResponsibleSteel™ site standard across nearly all its


--- Page 59 ---

62 Management report

European flat products production sites with positive results.
It is currently working on a site assessment and verification
plan and is on track to seek certification for its European
Flat sites next year. ArcelorMittal believes that its leading
role in the development of ResponsibleSteel™, and its
commitment to achieve certification in 2020, will enable the
Company to improve customer relations, increase market
share among customers already seeking certification, and
create demand for certified products.

ArcelorMittal also plays a leading role in the wider
movement towards establishing social and environmental
standards for mining that stakeholders recognize and value.
As a member of the IRMA (the Initiative for Responsible
Mining Assurance) steering committee, ArcelorMittal
participates in the multi-stakeholder expert panels shaping
its standards. Another example is its commitment to the
Mining Association of Canada’s Towards Sustainable Mining
initiative at its mines in Canada, which helps the Company
to monitor and improve performance and customer
reassurance.

The Company is also a member of a multi-stakeholder
collaboration on sustainable tin production in Indonesia, the
Tin Working Group.

The Company engages directly on responsible supply chain
issues with customers from the automotive, rail and other
sectors, including construction, household goods and
packaging, as well as with initiatives used by customers to
share their processes for assessing supply chain risk, such
as DRIVE Sustainability, Electronic Industry Citizen
Coalition, Railsponsible, EcoVadis and the Green Building
Council.

Alongside these multi-stakeholder, customer-focused
initiatives, the Company is committed to driving standards in
its own supply chain. Since 2011, the Company’s Code for
Responsible Sourcing has set out minimum standards for its
suppliers and described how it will work with suppliers to
achieve them. In 2018, the Company continued to ask all
new global suppliers to sign the Code and surveyed key
suppliers for their implementation of the Code. At the same
time, it reinforced its risk mapping analyses, with particular
reference to its raw material suppliers. This process aims to
identify social and environmental areas of concern, and the
key hotspots for further due diligence; the Company is
developing action plans where these are needed. It also
identifies those suppliers which have the potential to take
part in certification schemes in the future.

Overall, the Company is shaping its supplier process to be
better aligned to the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (“OECD”) guidelines on due
diligence on supply chains, in particular for conflict minerals,
which reflect continued concern that some conflicts around
the world are being financed by the trade in minerals such
as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. From a portfolio of more

than 2,000 steel products, only a very limited number of
ArcelorMittal products contain tin and tungsten, which are
necessary for the functionality or production of certain
products.

Management Theme #4: Environment

Behind the SDGs to which ArcelorMittal is committed, is a
vision of progress that leaves no-one behind. The Company
therefore focuses on making steel in ways that work for
society, without creating harmful carbon footprints (as
discussed in “Management Theme #2: Climate Change"
above), or other negative environmental impacts. The
Company aims to meet stakeholders’ expectations around
the use of shared resources, particularly natural capital in
the form of air, land and water. Operating transparently and
responsibly in these areas is essential for retaining
stakeholders’ trust.

The Company continues to make significant environmental
investments, and in 2019, ArcelorMittal’s IAC has approved
a total of 38 projects with environmental benefits totalling
$692 million.

Some of the challenges affecting air, land and water are
global in nature, and ArcelorMittal engages in multi-
stakeholder forums aimed at addressing them. Where the
issues and the means of addressing them are local, country
managers engage with stakeholders at every level,
including site-by-site. Before developing any new mine or
steel plant, the Company carries out detailed environmental
impact assessments, and establishes an environmental
management plan. At all existing production sites, it
monitors air, water, energy and residue data, and publishes
data annually in its Integrated Annual Review and country
level sustainability reports, of which 12 were published in
2019.

The Company monitors regulatory developments and aims
to be fully compliant with regulatory standards. The
Company also aims to listen to concerns wherever they are
raised, and to respond appropriately, including by
acknowledging where its standards have fallen short. In
2019, the Company's focus on responding to environmental
issues was centered on addressing air quality concerns,
managing tailing storage facilities and tailings transition
plans, improving land use and biodiversity and responsible
water use, as further discussed below.

Addressing air quality concerns

In 2019, the Company’s investments in environmental
improvements included 16 projects to improve air quality.
ArcelorMittal understands that air quality is among the most
salient issues for the communities around its operations. It
is also a continuing focus for regulators, and the Company's
goal is to comply fully with regulatory standards. Although
the specific sources of pollutants, particularly in urban and
industrial areas, are not always identifiable, the Company


--- Page 60 ---

aims to listen to concerns wherever they are raised, and to
respond appropriately. The Company also continues to
make significant environmental investments that address air
quality.

In 2019, the following sites raised particular air quality
concerns, which were addressed by the Company:

Fos-sur-Mer (France)

In Fos-sur-Mer (France), ArcelorMittal acknowledges
stakeholder concerns and historic regulatory non-
compliance around emissions from the coke plant. Between
2012 and 2017, the Company invested €100 million in the
site, and succeeded in reducing dust emissions by 50%,
dioxins by 70%, and sulphur dioxide by 50%. After a further
investment of €130 million in the coke plant over 2012-2018,
and substantive work completed in 2019, the coke ovens
are now compliant. Investment will continue with an
additional €100 million by 2023 to reduce environmental
impact by a further 30%. Moreover, on public health issues,
ArcelorMittal supports scientific studies to establish an
accurate measure of air quality, its sources and its
implications for health.

Krivyi Rih (Ukraine)

The Company is also responding to concerns raised by
local stakeholders in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. In Ukraine,
over 14 years of operating in Krivyi Rih, the Company has.
invested $4.4 billion (2006-2018) in production processes
which resulted not only in improving the Company's
competitiveness but also reduced environmental footprint:
waste water discharge was reduced by 81% and dust
emissions by 48%.

ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih's strategy to further reduce their
environmental impact from dust covers all the main types of
production - mining, coke, steelmaking, rolling and sintering.
The latter is of key importance, since it accounts for about
75% of the plant's total dust emissions. The Company is
planning to build a pellet plant to replace the sinter plant at
the steel production site and sinter plant number 1 at the
mining production site, as well as modernizing sinter plant
number 2 at the mining production site. As a result of these
investments, dust emissions will be reduced by about 79%
within the sinter plant area and 43% across the whole site
between 2018 and 2024.

In addition, to further reduce emissions, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi
Rih applied an innovative method of repairing coke oven
batteries. The method is based on ceramic welding of deep
cracks with subsequent injection of powder mixtures to seal
small cracks in the refractory brickwork of coke ovens. Such
method to reduce dust emissions is already being used in
Europe, but is being implemented for the first time in
Ukraine. The Company is also planning construction of two
continuous casting machines and the new rolling mill which

Management report 63

will further reduce the environmental footprint of the
operations.

Kazakhstan

In Kazakhstan, where emissions and their impact on air
quality is the most pressing concern for local communities,
ArcelorMittal has built a comprehensive environmental plan
with local stakeholders. As part of this plan, in 2018, the
Company announced a $198 million environmental
investment program. The projects in its scope will result in a
series of incremental performance improvements
throughout the investment plan’s implementation period to
2025. The program is focused on removing dust from a
range of facilities including the lime plant, the coke shop and
related processes, the sinter plant, the steel shop, blast
furnace 2 and its associated storage area.

ArcelorMittal Italia

ArcelorMittal Italia, has undertaken an ambitious
environmental engineering project at its Taranto site:
creating the world’s largest suite of primary raw materials
coverage yards. Work on the iron ore yard coverage was
completed in late 2019 and it will play a key role in reducing
diffused dust dispersion towards the city, particularly in the
Tamburi district. The coke yard coverage is expected to be
completed in May 2020.

Another key milestone will be the coverage of the coal yard.
Each structure is made up of six arches which collectively
use around 22,000 tonnes of steel pipes produced by
ArcelorMittal. With a height of 77 meters, the equivalent of
an 18-floor building, and a length of 476 meters and a width
of 254 meters, equal to around 17 professional-sized
football pitches. The ongoing work and the scope of the
environmental plan is subject to ongoing negotiations with
the Commissioners for a new industrial plan for ArcelorMittal
Italia. For further information, see “Key transactions and
events in 2019—ArcelorMittal Italia acquisition”.

Managing tailings storage facilities

The stability of tailings dams is a risk that every mining
company faces and managing them carefully to ensure they
are structurally sound is a vital aspect of ArcelorMittal’s
responsibility as a mining company. The tragedy of the Vale-
owned Feijao dam failure prompted all mining companies to
examine the monitoring systems at their tailings storage
facilities (“TSFs"). ArcelorMittal has 24 TSFs, which include
dry stack and in-pit disposal, of which 19 are active, 5 are
dormant.

The Company employs a strong governance model based
on the Mining Association of Canada’s (“MAC”) guidelines
for TSFs. Its global tailings stewardship program employs
three types of audits: in-house at site level, in-house at
corporate level and an entirely independent audit, which are
benchmarked against international guidelines of Australian

National Committee on Large Dams ("ANCOLD"), MAC and
Canadian Dam Association ("CDA").

ArcelorMittal’s Serra Azul mine's tailings has been dormant
since 2012 and the Company had commenced reclamation
to re-process tailings through the concentrator in January
2019. In February 2019, following stress tests on the Serra
Azul dam model safety factors, the Company decided to
evacuate the local community downstream of the dam as a
precaution, enabling the Company to carry out further
testing and safely implement any mitigation measures.

Mining operations were simultaneously suspended but were
recommenced on March 18, 2019. Following an update of
the theoretical dam break analysis, and adopting the most
conservative assumptions, the potential area of impact has
been expanded, in order to keep a greater margin of safety.
In response, ArcelorMittal relocated 23 families from two
communities to temporary homes as a precautionary
measure. Monthly emergency payments have been made to
the relocated families as well as to people who lost access
to their land - in total 149 families have been directly
impacted. For safety reasons, access to the evacuated area
continues to be restricted and controlled according to
guidance from local authorities.

ArcelorMittal is employing continuous 24/7 monitoring of the
tailings storage facility via radar, accelerometers,
piezometers and imaging, and is currently reviewing its
approach to safely deconstructing the Serra Azul TSF.

The Company is working on potential application of non-wet
or reduced moisture tailings disposal methodologies such
as thickened, paste, dry stack and in-pit tailings options
where appropriate. This approach is already in use in
Mexico, Brazil and Quebec iron ore mines.

Improving land use and biodiversity

ArcelorMittal aims to practice good land use management,
and to protect biodiversity in the environments where it
operates, including through partnerships with local
environmental organizations and others to improve and
research local biodiversity.

Mining is a key focus both in terms of responsible land
management and biodiversity.

In Liberia, the Company operates a Biodiversity
Conservation Program (“BCP”) to address the damage
caused by agriculture and mining.

ArcelorMittal’s Liberian mines are set in Nimba County,
surrounded by both mountain and lowland rainforest.
ArcelorMittal’s mining area consists of approximately 51,000
hectares in Nimba County, representing less than 1% of the
total forest. The Nimba Mountains are renowned for their
biodiversity but have been damaged by agricultural
practices and overhunting.

Launched in 2011, the BCP is the Company’s approach to
developing sustainable forest management throughout the
area. Through the BCP, the Company is partnering with
authorities and communities to create a healthy ecosystem
and sustainable livelihoods across the region. The
Company spent almost $2 million on the BCP program in
the last three years and its achievements include training
1,000 farmers in conservation agriculture, retraining 50
hunters as front-line conservationists and replanting trees in
Tokedeh and Gangra.

The impact of the Company's steelmaking activities on
biodiversity can be less apparent than mining, given that
most steel operations are located in urban areas.
Nonetheless, ArcelorMittal runs a range of programs aimed
at protecting and enhancing ecosystems. For example,
ArcelorMittal Tubarao has implemented a green belt around
the plant, housing about 2.6 million trees and shrubs and
eight different permanent preservation areas, with lagoons,
swamps, mangroves, and beaches. In partnership with the
Capixaba Institute for Research, Technical Assistance and
Rural Extension (Incaper), ArcelorMittal Tubarao is currently
conducting research to improve the diversity of flora and
fauna in its green project. Another example is ArcelorMittal
Mediterranee which works with the bureau d’étude
écologique Eco-Med to manage close to 450 hectares of
protected natural spaces within its Fos-sur-Mer site.

Responsible water use

Water is a vital resource to the Company and its
stakeholders, and ArcelorMittal aims to be responsible both
in the amount of water it consumes, and in the quality of the
water discharged by its sites into the environment. Its work
in the area is aligned to the UN's SDG 6 (Clean water and
sanitation), with particular reference to the target 6.3 on
water recycling, target 6.4 on water efficiency, and target 6.5
on water management.

The Company's net water use in steelmaking, defined as
the difference between the water it withdraws and the water
discharged, is measured, monitored and managed at each
site by a dedicated team. In general, steel plants treat and
recycle the same intake of water repeatedly, losing water
only through evaporation. Water withdrawn from
groundwater sources makes up less than 1% of the
Company's water intake. Water treatment facilities play a
vital role in managing the Company's emissions to water,
and in improving the water efficiency of its operations.

Unlike reducing carbon emissions, which is a global
challenge, water use is a more localized issue. Where
freshwater is scarce, or when there is a drought, the
Company works with local municipal and water authorities
to explore the best sources for water, including seawater,
rainwater and wastewater from water treatment plants.
When issues occur, ArcelorMittal aims to act swiftly and co-
operatively with local authorities.

In August 2019, ArcelorMittal Burns Harbor experienced a
failure at the pump station for the blast furnace process
water recycle system, which is believed to have contributed
to the reported excess of Ammonia-N and cyanide at two
outfalls and impacted aquatic wildlife near those outfalls.
ArcelorMittal Burns Harbor has continued daily sampling for
cyanide and ammonia and other regulated pollutants. The
results are provided to the state regulatory authority
responsible for water issues. The Company believes the
circumstances leading up to the station failure were unique
and it continues to investigate the station failure and related
water concerns in coordination with regulatory authorities to
understand what happened and to implement measures
designed to prevent recurrence.

ArcelorMittal Burns Harbor has two permits which impose
monitoring requirements and establish certain limits for
pollutants regulated under those permits. Any surpassing of
limits or other violations of permit requirements are reported
to the state water authority. While any instance of non-
compliance is concerning, the Company does not believe
that the reported non-compliance with the permit
requirements in any way reflect systemic issues. Any
instances of non-compliance are investigated, and
appropriate actions are taken in response. Governmental
authorities are tasked with responding to non-compliance
with permits in the way they deem appropriate in response
to the reported information. For further information, see note
9.3 to the consolidated financial statements.

Recognizing the importance of water within our business
and our communities, the Company continued its leadership
role in Sustain Our Great Lakes ("SOGL") in 2019, a public-
private partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife
Foundation ("NFWF"), U.S. EPA, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, U.S.D.A. Forest Service, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, and U.S.D.A. Natural
Resources Conservation Service. SOGL’s mission is to
restore and protect fish, wildlife and habitat throughout the
basin by leveraging funding, building conservation capacity
and focusing partners and their resources on key ecological
issues. Since 2006, the program has awarded 337 grants
totaling nearly $81 million, which when combined with $93.5
million in grantee match, has resulted in a total conservation
investment of more than $174.5 million in the region.

The Company seeks to improve water use and the quality of
effluent discharge at its mine sites and conducts regular
water quality monitoring as standard at all operations. Run-
off from the Company's mining operations is treated either
chemically or through sediment control dams and tested
before being released into surface water bodies or reused
elsewhere at the mine. Where possible, water is reused for
processing, for example, as part of the cooling process
during pellet production. At AMMC, a multi-year holistic
water management project aimed at controlling the surface
effluents on the waste rock piles and to achieve compliance
with federal regulations is ongoing. This consists of the

Management report 65

construction of collector ditches on the perimeter of the
waste rock piles and the installation of temporary and
permanent water treatment units in Mont Wright and Fire-
Lake.

ArcelorMittal Brasil has one of the highest rates of water
recirculation amongst Brazilian steelmakers, of
approximately 98%. Between 2015 and 2017, ArcelorMittal
Mineragao Serra Azul managed to reduce its water intake
by more than 50%, from efficiencies in both the mining and
processing stages. The plant’s water resource management
from ArcelorMittal Mineragao Serra Azul provides high rates
of water recirculation in the iron ore beneficiation process. In
2019, the index was 88.5%.

Management Theme #5: Social

ArcelorMittal wants communities to recognize it as a good
neighbor, that actively engages with local stakeholders to
make a positive contribution in terms of creating economic
and social value through employment, procurement,
taxation and sustainable development initiatives and
through strong risk management and respect for human
rights. To do this, the Company understands it must take a
partnership approach, listening to the concerns of
stakeholders at the site, country and segment levels, to give
them the confidence that ArcelorMittal will address the
impacts it has on them and their environment. ArcelorMittal
wants to be a pro-active partner in local socio-economic
development; one which is trusted to have an open dialogue
and find constructive solutions when challenges arise. This
approach is an essential part of the Company’s integrated
approach to managing risks and impacts, and thus
maintaining the Company's social license to operate.

Direct management of community issues, monitoring of
local risks and opportunities and how these are being
addressed is led by local operations. In 2019, community
dashboards were established with the ARCGS Committee
to oversee the significance of a site’s risks and
opportunities.

The aim is to use the dashboards to improve performance
at sites identified as being at risk, in particular those
consider to be high risk. For all sites that are considered
‘high risk’, a deeper dive is performed by the corporate
responsibility team, usually with site visits, to understand the
underlying factors behind the site’s situation. This root
cause analysis is used to identify trends and patterns in the
factors behind poor community relations. A similar but less
in-depth approach is taken with ‘medium risk' sites.

In addition, in 2019, the Company continued to increase its
corporate oversight of local sites’ stakeholder engagement
plans and grievance-handling mechanisms, developing a
new standard for ArcelorMittal community procedures to be
implemented at all sites. This standard sets the minimum
requirements for planning, implementation, monitoring and


--- Page 63 ---

66 Management report

evaluation of community engagement and development
activities. It is defined by four priorities:

+ Understanding local communities by conducting
social context analyses of local impacts and
opportunities, human rights and associated
impacts, and trends linked to the local risk profile;

+ Comprehensive planning of human rights
assessments, stakeholder engagement,
mechanisms to manage community complaints
and grievances, and community investment
strategies;

+ — Effective implementation of development activities
through strong leadership, appropriate resource,
timely engagement, and robust governance; and

+ Consistent monitoring and evaluation of
performance through community perception
surveys, analysis of grievances, and annual
independent verification of data and social
performance.

The Company also analyzes broader trends across its
global portfolio in relation to community issues enabling it to
make sure best practices are shared between sites.
Examples of how the Company works to share best
practices for community engagement include the
Company’s quarterly Community Liaison Committee in
Avilés, Spain and its multi-stakeholder forum in Poland
which follows the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement
Standard (2015) methodology. The Company also continues
to foster collaborative relations, bringing sites’ corporate
responsibility teams across the group together through
webinars and internal seminars. In February 2019,
ArcelorMittal corporate responsibility representatives from
over 18 countries met in Milan, Italy for a three-day
knowledge management program to network, discuss
current issues and learn from one another.

Alongside responding to communities’ needs and concerns,
the Company's community investment strategy focuses on
developing skills in STEM (science, technology, engineering
and mathematics). This reflects the important role scientists
and engineers will play in building a sustainable future for
society at large, for the steel industry and for the Company.
The strategy is delivered in many ways: from providing
teaching aids and technological support, through inviting
students to steel plants, to the Company's long-term
partnerships with leading academic organizations around
the world.

Sustainable Development Governance

The Company's commitment to integrity is enshrined in its
code of business conduct and is supported by a
comprehensive framework of policies in areas such as
human rights, anti-corruption, and insider dealing. These

reflect the principles and concepts of the UN Global
Compact, the OECD Guidelines on Multinational
Enterprises and UN Sustainable Development Goal 16
("Peace, justice and strong institutions"). See also “
Directors, senior management and employees and Board
practices/corporate governance”.

Listening, learning, respect and transparency are key to the
integrity of the Company’s leadership and governance,
which helps ensure ArcelorMittal operates effectively and
ethically in all parts of the world.

ArcelorMittal considers its relationships with its various
stakeholders to be vital to its success. Conducted in the
right way, these relationships help the Company know how
best to respond to challenges, to anticipate future problems,
and to earn trust. ArcelorMittal’s operations in each country
are encouraged to assess their stakeholders’ expectations
and concerns, in order to inform their approach to the 10 SD
outcomes and 5 management themes. Working with
customers, suppliers, unions and others can also contribute
to UN SDG 17 (Partnership for the goals).

Fully integrating SD into the business is essential to reach
the Company's aim of achieving long-term value for its
shareholders and other stakeholders, while maintaining a
profitable market share. As discussed above, ArcelorMittal
introduced a sustainable development framework including
10 SD outcomes in 2015 and the ARCGS oversees the
Company's progress towards these outcomes, as well as
the Company's overarching strategy towards SD according
to the five management themes described above. The
Company's approach to meeting its SD targets includes:

+ Key Performance Indicators. A set of KPls for every
business segment to report against, overseen by the
ARCGS;

+ | §D-focused Business Plans. An expectation that SD
is integrated into each business segment plan, acting
on the relevant SD issues material to its business;

+  §D-focused Corporate Initiatives. Corporate
initiatives on SD for the benefit of the Group, which
include, for example, accelerating progress towards
low-carbon steelmaking; innovating steel solutions for
a positive SD impact; and developing a ‘mine to metal’
chain of assurances measured against multi-
stakeholder environmental and social standards; and

+ | §D-focused Reporting. A robust articulation of the
Company's approach and progress through clear
narrative and transparent, third-party assured
reporting. In 2018, climate change was identified as
one of the themes to be overseen by the ARCGS,
which then nominated senior officers to take
responsibility for its low-carbon transition strategy, its
carbon performance, and its work on advocating for
the introduction of carbon-related government policies.
