THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

| 5.1. Operating and financial review

The elements of chapter 5.1 come from the 2015 management report as
adopted by the Company's Board of Directors, meeting on 15 February 2016'.

5.1.1 KEY FIGURES

Pursuant to European regulation no. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 on the
adoption of international accounting standards, the EDF group’s consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are prepared
under the international accounting standards published by the IASB and
approved by the European Union for application at 31 December 2015.
These international standards are IAS (International Accounting Standards),
IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), and SIC and IFRIC
interpretations.

The Group’s accounting policies are presented in note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements at 31 December 2015.

The figures presented in this document are taken from the EDF group’s
consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2015.

EXTRACT FROM THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT:

The comparative figures for 2014 have been restated to reflect the impact
of retrospective application of IFRIC 21 “Levies”. This interpretation has
been applicable since 1 January 2015 and is applied retrospectively in
compliance with IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors”.

For the Group, the main consequence of this change in accounting method
concerns the recognition of certain taxes, which are no longer spread over
the year but recorded as soon as the triggering event for those taxes arises,
which in most cases is during the first half-year.

The taxes concerned by this change in recognition practice essentially relate
to operation of the EDF group’s businesses in France. Many of them are
taxes for which the triggering event arises on 1 January, such as the tax on
nuclear facilities, the tax on network firms (IFER), land tax, pylon tax and
hydropower tax.

The application of IFRIC 21 has no significant impact on the annual
consolidated financial statements.

The Group's key figures for 2015 are shown in the following tables.

5.1.2 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

5.1.2.1. Trends in market prices for electricity and the principal energy sources

In an increasingly interconnected European market, analysis of market prices in France and the rest of Europe provides vital context.

Spot electricity prices in Europe were higher overall during 2015 than 2014. The sharper temperatures of 2015, with a colder first quarter and hotter summer
than the previous year, counterbalanced the downward pressure on prices associated with the fall in fuel prices. Only German spot prices decreased, due
to a substantial rise in energy generation from renewable sources.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

The comments below concern baseload prices.

In France, spot electricity prices stood at an average €38.5/MWh in 2015,
€3.8MWh higher than in 2014. This price rise was mainly driven by
temperatures which, compared to 2014, were 1.8°C colder in the first
quarter and 0.7°C higher in the third quarter, and also by lower water levels.

The rise in demand in the first quarter was partly met by more extensive use
of fossil-fired thermal plants. Despite the higher demand, the increase in spot
prices was limited by the fall in gas and coal prices. Second and third quarter
spot prices were relatively similar to 2014, although consumption levels
were lower year-on-year in May (which contained several public holidays)
and December (when temperatures were well above normal for the month).

2015 was marked by stable availability for the nuclear power plants,
higher wind power and photovoltaic power output, and lower levels of
hydropower generation.

In the United Kingdom, spot electricity prices rose by €3.5/MWh compared
to 2014 to an average €55.7/MWh. The rise occurred in the second and third

quarters, which showed respective year-on-year increases of €10.1/MWh
and €9.0/MWh.

In Italy, average spot prices remained stable (+0.2%) compared to 2014,
at €52.3/MWh.

In Germany, spot prices stood at an average €31.6/MWh, €1.1/MWh lower
than their 2014 level. This was the lowest average price since 2005. Despite
lower temperatures than the previous year, the supply/demand balance
was relaxed on the whole, helped by plentiful supplies of wind power in
particular while photovoltaic solar power output remained stable overall.
Total wind power output for 2015 was 8.6GW, up by 2.5GW from 2014.

In Belgium, spot prices were up by €3.9/MWh compared to 2014, with
an average price of €44.7/MWh. This rise is attributable to the markedly
lower available nuclear capacity. The Doel 1 plant, which was shut down in
February 2015 to prepare for a 10-year extension of its operating life after
40 years of use, only started up again on 30 December 2015. Two nuclear
power plants (Doel 3 and Tihange 2) which had been shut down in late
March 2014 also received authorisation to restart in December 2015.

5.1.2.1.2 Forward electricity prices in Europe’

France United Kingdom Italy Germany Belgium
Average forward baseload price under the 2016 annual
contract for 2015 (€/MWh) 38.2 58.8 47.2 31.0 43.3
Variation in average forward baseload price under the annual
contracts, 2015/2014 -10.1% -6.8% -12.3% -11.7% 7.5%
Forward baseload price under the 2016 annual contract
at 28 December 2015 (€/MWh) 33.8 49.2 46.2 28.1 33.3
Average forward peakload price under the 2016 annual
contract for 2015 (€/MWh) 47.0 66.5 52.7 39.1 51.9
Variation in average forward peakload price under the annual
contracts, 2015/2014 “11.5% -6.7% -12.2% -12.0% -9.3%
Forward peakload price under the 2016 annual contract
at 28 December 2015 (€/MWh) 42.3 56.9 52.5 34.3 42.1

Annual contract prices for baseload and peakload electricity were lower on
average than in 2014 in Europe, mainly due to lower fuel prices.

In France, the annual contract baseload price was 10.1% (-€4.3/MWh)
lower on average than in 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the fall
in coal, oil and gas prices, although it was slightly offset by the rise in CO,
emission prices and changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Apart from
an increase after the announcement in February of production restrictions
for the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands and a tense short-term
supply/demand balance during the summer which affected the forward
contract, electricity prices dropped sharply along with fuel prices, and the
movement was accentuated in November by the announced restart of the
Belgian Tihange 2 and Doel 3 nuclear plants.

In the United Kingdom, the April Ahead contract baseload price for
1 April Y+1 to 31 March Y+2 decreased by 6.8%, in keeping with the
downward trend in gas prices. This decline was slightly offset by the rise
in the UK’s carbon tax on electricity generation, which was increased from
around £9.0/t to £18.08/t from 1 April 2015.

(1) France and Germany: average year-ahead EEX price;
Belgium and Italy: average year-ahead EDF Trading price;

In Italy, the annual contract baseload price also registered a substantial
downturn and was €6.5/MWh lower on average than in 2014. This drop
was caused by lower gas prices and the progression in installed renewable
energy capacity.

In Germany, the annual contract baseload price was down by an average
€4.1/MWh from 2014. This decrease is attributable to falling fuel prices,
which were slightly counterbalanced by a rise in CO, emission prices and
the effect of the EUR/USD exchange rate, together with the expansion of
almost 10GW in wind farms and photovoltaic plants in Germany. German
prices moved in line with French prices for the whole year apart from April,
July and October.

In Belgium, the annual contract baseload price was lower than in 2014
by 7.5% on average, standing at €43.3/MWh. This decrease is explained
by the fall in fuel prices, and the restart of operations by the Doel 3 and
Tihange 2 reactors announced in November.

Forward prices for coal delivered in Europe continued their decline in 2015
and the supply/demand balance was very relaxed. They declined progressively
over the year, from US$65.9/t to US$44/t at the year-end. Demand remained
subdued, with a sluggish outlook for China, compounded in September
by restrictions on poor-quality coal imports into China. Coal supplies
remained plentiful from both Russia and South Africa, which sent some
of their production to Europe rather than Asia. A few individual events
caused tensions during the year, such as the landslide in Russia’s Kuzbass
coalmining area, and uncertainties over the nocturnal operation of the
Colombian railway line that carries more than half of the 90 million tonnes
of coal produced in Colombia every year.

At 31 December 2015, the crude oil price stood at US$37.3/bbl, a year-
on-year drop of US$20/bbl. This decrease masks contrasting movements
over the year. February was initially marked by a rise in the price per barrel
to more than US$62/bbl due to supply-side tensions (conflicts in Libya
and Iraq, restrictions on North Sea oil production, reduction of shale oil

NATURAL GAS AND OIL PRICES

production in America). Prices then relaxed in response to information on
an imminent agreement for Iranian nuclear power, and rose rapidly in April
to reach US$67.8/bbl on 6 May, boosted by a significant downturn in US
production. Since then, the price has gradually declined, with the prospect
of higher supply on the market following the agreement on Iranian nuclear
power, plus a relatively large supply coming from the main oil-producing
countries (Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States) and the prospect of a
fall in Chinese demand.

Natural gas prices under the annual contract in France were lower than
in 2014. Despite production restrictions at the Groningen gas field in the
Netherlands, prices declined due to greater availability of LNG in Europe
caused by lower demand in Asia, and an easing of the tensions between
Russia and Ukraine. The downturn in oil prices also led to a fall in long-term
supply contracts which are partly indexed on oil commodity prices. Russian
gas supplies to Europe also increased between 2014 and 2015.

5.1.2.2 Electri

‘ity 1 and gas? consumption

Overall electricity consumption in France in 2015 was up by 2.2%
from 2014. Electricity consumption for the first half-year was 4.2% higher
in 2015 than 2014 because of colder temperatures, principally in the first
four months. July and August were warmer in 2015 than 2014, boosting
demand. But the last quarter, despite a cool October which caused a 7.8%
increase in consumption, could not offset the 10.6% year-on-year decrease
observed for the single month of December.

After correction for weather effects, electricity consumption in France was
up slightly by 0.5% after three years of stability. Consumption by small
and medium-sized businesses and residential customers was also up by
0.6%, while consumption by large industrial customers was stable (+0.2 %)
compared to 2014.

In the United Kingdom, estimated electricity consumption was down
by 0.4% from 2014, mainly due to improvements in energy efficiency. In
Italy, electricity consumption was up by 1.5% as a result of exceptional
temperatures in the third quarter of 2015.

Natural gas consumption in France rose by 8.1% in 2015. The main
reason for this increase was the relatively mild weather of 2014 and a
colder February and October 2015 with below-normal temperatures. But
in December 2015, temperatures were 3.9°C above seasonal norms: it was
the warmest December on record in France since 1900, with lower year-
on-year gas consumption.

Estimated natural gas consumption in the United Kingdom was up by
4.1% from 2014 due to lower temperatures and higher demand. In Italy,
domestic demand for natural gas increased by +9.1% as a result of favourable
weather conditions, leading to a rise in consumption on the residential
market and for thermal power generation.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

5.1.2.3. Electricity and natural gas sales tariffs

For details of recent developments concerning tariffs in France,
see section 5.1.3.6.1.5, “Regulated electricity sales tariffs in France”.

In the United Kingdom, there were two tariff changes in 2015:

= on 11 February 2015, fixed gas tariffs were reduced by 1.3%. This
decrease is explained by the fall in gas prices on the wholesale markets.
and is coherent with the reduction in fixed gas tariffs applied by the five
other largest energy suppliers in the UK;

@ in early March 2015, new, more competitive fixed-tariff products were
introduced on the B2C segment. The “Blue Price Promise June 2016”
guarantees a fixed price of £965 per year up to and including June 2016,
and the “Blue Price Promise February 2017” guarantees a fixed price of
£999 a year up to and including February 2017.

5.1.2.4 Weather conditions: temperatures
and rainfall

2015 was a particularly warm year. In France, average temperatures were
0.3°C above normal levels, making 2015 the third-warmest year since 1900
after 2014 and 2011.

Widely contrasting temperatures were recorded during the year:

= February temperatures were 2°C below normal, and the early autumn
(September and October) was relatively cool;

m= the summer (July and August) was around 2°C warmer than in 2014;

2015 was marked by a significant shortfall in annual precipitation in many European countries contained in a wide band of land stretching from the Iberian

peninsula to the former USSR countries, and therefore comprising France.

The opposite situation was observed in Northern Europe (the British Isles and Scandinavia) and Southern Europe (South Italy, the Balkans and Turkey), where

there was surplus precipitation.

In France, except in the Pyrenees which registered surplus precipitation,
there was a shortfall in precipitation in the first half of 2015, particularly in
the Southern Alps and the central regions. A heat wave in July accentuated
this shortfall and led to severely low water levels before a rainy month of
August improved the situation. Autumn brought further shortfalls, especially
in December, which was a very mild, dry month.

268 EDF | 2015 Reference Document

As a consequence of these unusual weather conditions, French hydropower
capacity was below normal for every month of the year, particularly in the
second half of the year when the shortage gradually worsened until it
reached the lowest point of the year in December. The cumulative shortfall
for the year 2015 was the fourth most serious in more than 30 years
after 1989, 2005 and 2011.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

5.1.3 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2015*

5.1.3.1 European Commission decision

on the tax treatment of provisions
established between 1987 and 1996
for renewal of the General Network

On 22 July 2015 the European Commission adopted a new decision
classifying the tax treatment of provisions established between 1987 and
1996 for renewal of the General Network facilities as state aid that is
incompatible with European Union rules.

This decision followed the European Union General Court's cancellation,
through a decision of December 2009 upheld by the Court of Justice of
the European Union in June 2012, of the Commission's initial decision
of 16 December 2003 on the grounds that when making its decision the
Commission should have applied the private investor principle to determine
whether or not the action constituted state aid.

Following this cancellation the French state repaid €1,224 million to EDF
on 30 December 2009, corresponding to the sum paid by EDF to the French
state in February 2004 (the respective shares of ERDF and RTE? had already
been transferred). The European Commission then decided in May 2013
to reopen the proceedings.

In the decision of 22 July 2015 the Commission concluded that state aid
incompatible with the common market had indeed been given. As a result
of this decision the French state ordered EDF to reimburse the amount
corresponding to the alleged aid, plus interest calculated as determined
by the Commission.

In response to this decision EDF reimbursed the sums demanded. However,
the Group contests the existence of unlawful state aid and filed an action for
annulment before the European Union General Court on 22 December 2015.

Following this decision, on 13 October 2015 EDF made a payment
of €1,383 million to the French state, which was partly offset by a
reimbursement of €375 million received from RTE. The detailed impact
on the Group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2015 is
presented in note 3.3 to these financial statements.

5.1.3.2 Liberalisation of hydropower
concessions in France

The European Commission (EC) Directorate-General for Competition
has begun proceedings against the French state concerning hydropower
concessions in France, on the grounds of Article 106, Chapter 1 of the Treaty
on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), read in conjunction with Article 102
of the same Treaty.

The European Commission therefore sent a formal notice to the French
state on 22 October 2015, stating that it considered the fact that most
hydropower concessions in France are attributed to and reserved for EDF
as a violation of the above articles, since these measures reinforced EDF's
dominant position on the French retail electricity markets.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

The State had two months to reply to this notice, which marked the
beginning of an adversarial exchange of positions between the State and
the EC, without prejudice to the final outcome. As the principal interested
party, EDF received a copy of this notice. It sent the EC its observations in
response to the notice on 4 January 2016, firmly contesting the EC's analysis
and the grounds for this analysis.

5.1.3.3 Strategic development

Agreements for construction
of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant

EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) signed a strategic
investment agreement on 21 October 2015 for a joint investment in the
construction of two reactors at Hinkley Point C.

The agreement includes a broad UK partnership to develop new nuclear
power plants at Sizewell and Bradwell. Contracts between the British
government and EDF, and contracts with Hinkley Point C's four main
suppliers, have also been finalised.

Under the Strategic Investment Agreement, EDF's share in Hinkley Point C
should be 66.5% and CGN‘s should be 33.5%. Without reducing this initial
stake below 50%, EDF will in due course consider bringing other investors
into the project.

EDF and CGN have also agreed the principal terms of a wider partnership
for the joint development of new nuclear power stations at Sizewell in
Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. These terms will be finalised before the final
investment decision for Hinkley Point C.

The stages involved in a final investment decision are as follows:

= finalisation by EDF of its financing plan and contribution by CGN of
guarantees for its own financing;

= approval by the EDF and CGN Boards of Directors;

™ clearance by merger control and other governmental authorities in
China and Europe;

= finalisation of contractual documentation based on agreements signed
in October 2015.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

5.1.3.4.1.2 Extension of a series of existing agreements
with EDF's Chinese partners

As part of their strategic partnerships, EDF and China General Nuclear Power
Group (CGN) announced on 29 January 2015 that they had signed a new
agreement to share their experience of plant operation and engineering for
existing nuclear fleets, with the aim of preserving the highest safety levels
and maintaining consistency between French and Chinese procedures and
standards. EDF also signed an agreement with Huadian, a leading Chinese
electric utility, paving the way for future cooperation on joint projects in
China and at international level. The three key areas of focus are combined-
cycle gas-turbine power plants, hydropower plants and renewable energies.

During his visit to France on 30 June 2015 the Chinese Prime Minister
and French Prime Minister made a joint declaration on French-Chinese
cooperation in nuclear energy. They asked industrial operators to work
together more closely to design safe, competitive new third-generation
reactors that meet the needs of the global market.

Together with AREVA, EDF therefore signed agreements with its Chinese
partners CGN and CNNC to develop the approaches required by the
two governments.

5.1.3.4.1.3 Snam, GIC and EDF Invest sign an agreement
with Crédit Agricole Assurances for its investment
in TIGF

In January 2015, Snam, GIC, and EDF Invest announced that they had
concluded an agreement with Crédit Agricole Assurances for its entry into
the share capital of TIGF with a 10% stake. The transaction was finalised
on 26 February 2015. Upon its completion, Snam, GIC, EDF Invest and
Crédit Agricole Assurances now hold respectively 40.5%, 31.5%, 18%
and 10% of the share capital of TIGF indirectly.

5.1.3.4.1.4 EDF Invest finalises the acqui
of Madrilefa Red de Gas

In May 2015, EDF Invest and two other long-term investors finalised the
acquisition of a minority shareholding in Madrilefia Red de Gas (MRG). MRG
was formed in 2009 after a spinoff of some of the assets of Gas Natural
Fenosa, and is a regulated gas distribution network operator exclusively in
the Madrid region. The company is accounted for by the equity method
in the Group's consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2015.

5.1.3.4.1.5 Ardian and EDF Invest sign a firm agreement
for acquisition of a majority stake in Géosel
from Total

In December 2015 Ardian and EDF Invest, as equal shareholders in a
consortium, completed their acquisition from the Total group of an
investment of more than 50% in Géosel, a hydrocarbon storage company
based in Manosque, France.

Total has retained a minority stake and will continue to use Géosel’s
infrastructures for its own requirements.

With a capacity of almost 9 million m?, Géosel owns a critical site for
management of French strategic hydrocarbon reserves. The company owns
and operates underground storage cavities and related pipelines linked to
the Fos-Marseille seaport terminals and the petrochemical facilities of étang
de Berre (Fos-Lavera), all located in France.

This investment has been allocated to EDF Invest's “Infrastructures” pocket
alongside TIGF, Porterbrook and RTE.

5.1.3.4.2.2 Dalkia

Finalisation of Dalkia’s acquisition of Cesbron

On 24 March 2015, Dalkia announced the completion of its acquisition of
100% of Cesbron, an industrial and commercial refrigeration and HVAC
(heating, ventilation and air conditioning) specialist. Dalkia and Cesbron
will develop commercial synergies in order to improve their market shares
and respond positively to the challenges posed by the energy transition.
The closer relationship between the two companies means that integrated
offerings can be developed for customers looking for energy savings.

Dalkia’s acquisition of Zaklady Energetyki CiepInej Katowice SA

On 2 September 2015 Dalkia announced its acquisition of 100% of Zaklady
Energetyki CiepInej Katowice SA (ZEC), a company that essentially specialises
in production and distribution of heat in the Katowice region of Poland,
and its subsidiary EC Szopienice.

The company’s development plan, which focuses on mine gas recovery
and expanding heating networks, is set to decarbonise the region‘s energy
mix while making the best use of local resources and drawing on more
efficient processes.

The acquisition of ZEC is Dalkia’s first international external growth operation
since it became part of the EDF group. This ambitious project will make full
use of Dalkia’s expertise in heat networks and energy services for industrial
customers.

5.1.3.4.2.3 EDF Luminus

Finalisation of the agreement between EDF Luminus and ATS

On 27 May 2015, EDF Luminus’ acquisition of a majority stake in ATS SA.
was finalised after clearance by the Belgian competition authority. As well
as electric equipment, ATS sells fully-integrated solutions for electricity and
heating: design and engineering, installation and maintenance of industrial
electric networks, automation projects, industrial refrigeration, fire detection
and hydraulics. EDF Luminus and ATS will be able to better assist their
industrial customers and the service and public sectors through an enhanced
range of solutions for energy efficiency and optimisation of consumption.

New agreement on the EDF Luminus shareholder pact

On 26 October 2015 Publilec, Socofe, Ethias and Nethys, shareholders of
EDF Luminus, and the EDF group signed an amendment to the shareholder
pact, reaffirming their intent to support the company’s development.

This move put an end to the IPO process initiated the previous May.


--- Page 10 ---

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

The amendment signed extends the shareholder pact to 2025, providing
for the following reorganisation in the ownership structure (the control
exercised by the Group is unaffected):

= four Belgian shareholders will remain: Publilec (26.4%), Socofe (4.7%),
Ethias (0.2%) and Nethys (0.1%). Under the shareholder pact, they will
benefit from a liquidity mechanism allowing them to exit the capital
of EDF Luminus from the end of 2018, subject to certain conditions;

m the EDF group's stake will rise from 63.5% to 68.6%, as a result of the
Group's acquisition of the shares in EDF Luminus held by Publilum and
VEH for €58 million.

5.1.3.4.2.4 EDF Energies Nouvelles

Investments and disposals by EDF Energies Nouvelles

Following the third call for tenders from Hydro-Québec Distribution in 2013,
EDF Energies Nouvelles announced on 17 February 2015 that it had won
the contract for the Nicolas-Riou wind farm project (224.4MW) in Quebec,
through its local subsidiary EDF EN Canada. Construction should start in
the spring of 2016 and the plant is expected to be commissioned at the
end of 2017. This project is owned 50% by EDF EN Canada and 33% by
Energie Eolienne Bas-St-Laurent. The remaining 17% belongs to La Régie
Inter-Municipale de I'Energie Gaspésie-lles-de-la-Madeleine. The companies
have jointly signed a 25-year electricity supply contract with Hydro-Québec
Distribution.

On 25 February 2015, EDF Energies Nouvelles announced the creation of
a local subsidiary, EDF EN do Brasil based in Rio, marking its move into the
Brazilian market. EDF EN do Brasil started its local activities by acquiring a
majority stake in an 800MW portfolio of wind farm projects from SOWITEC, a
leading international renewable energy developer. This portfolio will be jointly
developed by EDF EN do Brasil and SOWITEC, which continues to be involved
in the projects in development through a minority 20% stake. Located in
one of the windiest areas in the state of Bahia, the portfolio includes an
initial 7OMW project due to be commissioned by the end of 2017. The
electricity produced will be sold under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA) that has been signed with ANEEL. On 26 November 2015, following
an auction organised by the Brazilian government, EDF Energies Nouvelles
announced through its subsidiary EDF EN do Brasil that it had been awarded
a long-term PPA for 117MW of wind power capacity.

On 14 April 2015, EDF Energies Nouvelles announced its arrival on the
Chilean market. Its new local subsidiary, EDF EN Chile, signed a financing
contract and a partnership agreement for a 146MWp solar photovoltaic
generation plant named Laberinto. Located in the Atacama Desert in northern
Chile, this project is owned in equal shares by EDF Energies Nouvelles and
Marubeni. EDF Energies Nouvelles has obtained long-term project funding
from a consortium of local and international banks. A local dedicated
subsidiary of EDF Energies Nouvelles will handle construction, operating
and maintenance of the solar plant.

On 23 June 2015 EDF Energies Nouvelles announced the acquisition of
the Salt Fork wind farm project in Texas via its North American subsidiary
EDF Renewable Energy. With a maximum capacity of 20OMW, this wind
farm, initially developed by Cielo Wind Power, is due to be commissioned
in late 2016. The electricity generated by the first 150MW from Salt Fork
will be sold to Garland Power & Light under a long-term power purchase
agreement.

On 12 November 2015 EDF Energies Nouvelles announced the acquisition
of the Dorenell wind farm project in Scotland by its UK subsidiary,
EDF Energy Renewables, which will build the facility. This large-scale project
of at least 177MW capacity will ultimately be the largest onshore wind farm
built by the Group in the United Kingdom.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

On 26 November 2015 EDF Energies Nouvelles announced its acquisition of
two wind farms with total capacity of 44MW, located in the départements
of Meuse (Trois-Sources) and Doubs (Lomont). They have been in operation
since 2007 and 2008. With this acquisition, after the commissioning of several
wind farms throughout France, the Group reached the 1GW milestone for
installed onshore wind power capacity in France.

EDF Energies Nouvelles also sold several power plants during 2015 for a
net total capacity of 623MW. Most of the facilities sold were wind farms.
The principal disposal took place in Canada and concerned 42.5% of the
Riviére-du-Moulin plant (148.8MW).

Development of EDF Energies Nouvelles’ operating
and maintenance activities

On 5 March 2015, EDF Energies Nouvelles announced the deployment
through its dedicated subsidiary EDF EN Services of its operating and
maintenance (O&M) service activities for renewable energy installations in
Belgium, with the creation of EDF EN Services Belgium. The new subsidiary is
jointly held with EDF Luminus, one of the EDF group's companies in Belgium,
and offers wind farm and solar plant management services in Belgium for
EDF Luminus and non-group owner-operators.

Long-term power purchase agreement between
EDF Energies Nouvelles and Google

On 3 December 2015 EDF Energies Nouvelles announced the signature
of a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Google and its
north American subsidiary EDF Renewable Energy. The electricity will be
generated by the future 201MW Great Western wind farm in Oklahoma.
The Great Western project is the second wind farm operation concerned
by an agreement between EDF Renewable Energy and Google.

Agreement between EDF Energies Nouvelles and
Procter & Gamble for construction of wind farms in Texas

On 20 October 2015, EDF Energies Nouvelles, through its subsidiary
EDF Renewable Energy, entered into a partnership with Procter & Gamble
(P&G) to supply wind-generated electricity to all P&G's north american sites
manufacturing laundry and household cleaning products. The electricity sold
to P&G, under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement, will be generated
by a wind farm in Cooke County, Texas, due to start operation in late 2016.

5.1.3.4.2.5 EDF Energy: acquisition of a wind farm
in the United Kingdom

On 2 April 2015 EDF Energy Renewables (owned 50% by EDF Energy and
50% by EDF Energies Nouvelles) announced the takeover of the plan to
construct a wind farm at Corriemoillie in Scotland, which will ultimately
have 19 turbines and total installed capacity of 45MW.

5.1.3.4.2.6 Edison: arbitration concerning the long-term
Libyan gas supply contract

On 27 November 2015, the International Chamber of Commerce Court
of Arbitration notified Edison and ENI of its decision regarding arbitration
concerning the long-term Libyan gas contract price. This decision led to
a positive impact of €855 million on the Group’s operating profit before
depreciation and amortisation for 2015.

(BE Zrt) and Energie Steiermark Holding AG
(Estag)

Sale of BE Zrt

On 10 December 2015, the EDF group finalised the sale of its majority 95.6%
stake in the Hungarian company Budapesti Erémti Zrt (BE Zrt) to EP Energy.

Sale of Estag

On 21 December 2015, the EDF group completed the sale of its minority
25% stake in Energie Steiermark Holding AG (Estag) following the signature
on 10 July 2015 of an agreement for this operation with Macquarie
Infrastructure and Real Assets.

The impact of these two sales on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements is not very significant.

5.1.3.5 Investment projects

5.1.3.5.1 France

5.1.3.5.1.1 Flamanville EPR

On 7 April 2015, AREVA and EDF announced that they had informed the
French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) that a new series of tests would be
launched to qualify the Flamanville EPR reactor vessel head and bottom.
This series of tests follows chemical and mechanical tests performed on a
representative component of the reactor vessel head and bottom, which
showed that one of the criteria was not fulfilled. The industrial processes
used on the Flamanville 3 reactor vessel are compliant with the mechanical
requirements implemented and validated for the French nuclear reactor
programme. The robustness of these processes has been demonstrated
through the 1,700 nuclear reactor years of safe operation. However, since
the 2005 order on nuclear pressure equipment (ESPN Order), the ASN has
required equipment to comply with new mechanical specifications to be
implemented at Flamanville 3. The EDF and AREVA teams are working to
complete the additional tests as soon as possible, following ASN approval
of the test conditions, and will provide the ASN with all the information
required to demonstrate the safety and quality of the equipment concerned.

On 12 December 2015, the ASN issued a position statement concerning
the approach used to demonstrate the mechanical properties of the
Flamanville 3 EPR reactor pressure vessel (RPV) closure head and bottom
head proposed by AREVA. Subject to its observations and requests being
taken into consideration, the ASN considers the approach proposed by
AREVA acceptable in principle, and has no objection to the initiation of a
new test programme.

In a letter of 12 June 2015, the President of the ASN acknowledged receipt
of the application for commissioning of Flamanville 3 remitted by EDF
on 19 March 2015, and requested additional information.

On 3 September 2015, EDF presented a new organisational structure for
the Flamanville EPR project, with a view to improving industrial construction
site management until commissioning has been completed.

The new structure involves:

™ a complete review of the project organisation and working methods,
centred around streamlined management reporting directly to
Mr Xavier Ursat, Group Senior Executive VP in charge of New Nuclear
Projects and Engineering, and Mr Jean-Bernard Lévy, EDF's Chairman
and CEO;

272

EDF | 2015 Reference Document

® introduction of new bodies with involvement of both EDF and its partners,
to provide close leadership, coordination and monitoring of the project;

™ greater on-site accountability and stronger managerial presence as the
construction phase comes to a close and test preparation gets underway;

= new contractual frameworks with key suppliers;

® enhanced dialogue with the ASN, particularly in respect of the new
regulations on nuclear pressure equipment.

Significant progresses have been made on the construction site recently.
98% of the civil engineering structure has been completed, as has 60%
of the electromechanical assembly. Pre-stressing operations on the reactor
building inner containment have been carried out, and the control room
has been commissioned.

The new roadmap, to which EDF and its partners are committed, aims to
optimise management of the project. The new timetable sets outs three
key milestones:

® primary circuit mechanical erection to be finalised in the first quarter
of 2016;

® electromechanical erection to be completed and system performance
testing to begin in the first quarter of 2017;

® first fuel loading and start-up of the reactor in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In response to this new start-up date, on 9 October 2015 EDF submitted a
request to the Ministry for Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
to change the final deadline for commissioning of the new reactor, which
was initially set at April 2017 in the authorisation decree.

Following assessment of all the industrial and financial parameters, project
costs have been revised to €10.5 billion.

EDF Production Electrique Insulaire (EDF PEI)

In keeping with its objectives to implement guaranteed-power electricity
generation facilities for Corsica and French overseas territories, the subsidiary
EDF PEI (standing for Production Electrique Insulaire or Island Electricity
Generation) commissioned the final five Diesel generators of the Pointe-Jarry
plant in Guadeloupe during the first half of 2015. By the end of the year,
all four of EDF PEI’s power plants were in operation, with a total generation
capacity of close to 7SOMW.

5.1.3.5.1.3 Programme of investment in existing nuclear
facilities in France

On 22 January 2015, EDF's Board of Directors approved the principle of
the major industrial overhaul programme (Grand carénage) to refurbish
‘the French nuclear fleet, enhance reactor safety, and extend operating lives
when the circumstances are suitable. The Board of Directors also expressed
its wish that the investment programme should be conducted, monitored
and controlled to the most exacting standards.

The cost of this investment programme is estimated at a maximum of
€,01355 billion by 2025 for the 58 reactors currently operating. This estimated
figure will be progressively confirmed after the optimisation of solutions
for rolling out the programme, additional review work, and consideration
of the multi-year energy plans (Programmations Pluriannuelles de I’Energie
or PPE, and the strategic plan) as set out in the energy transition Law for
green growth.

This industrial programme will be implemented gradually, in compliance
with that law, the multi-year energy plans, the opinions and orders of the
French Nuclear Security Authority (ASN), and the authorisation procedures
required for reactors to run for more than 40 years.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

5.1.3.5.2 Other activities

5.1.3.5.2.1 Principal wind farms and photovoltaic power
plants commissioned

EDF Energies Nouvelles commissioned a number of wind farms in North
America during 2015. With the new Longhorn (200MW) and Spinning
Spur 3 (194MW) facilities in Texas, the Roosevelt (250MW) wind farm
in New Mexico, the Pilot Hill (175MW) plant in Illinois and Slate Creek
(150MW) in Kansas, the Group now has more than 3GW of gross installed
capacity for renewable energy. In Canada, with the second tranche of
the Riviére-du-Moulin (2OOMW) and Mont-Rothery (74MW) wind farms,
EDF Energies Nouvelles has reached a total of 1.4GW in renewable energy.

EDF Energies Nouvelles also continued its development in Europe, notably
Turkey where the third section of the Soma wind farm (100MW) was
commissioned, and Poland where 58MW of capacity was installed at the
Rzepin wind farm.

Since starting up in South Africa early in the year, the Group has constructed
three wind farms (Grassridge, Chaba and Waainek) with total installed
capacity of more than 100MW.

In solar power, the Group commissioned two solar power plants totalling
150MWp of installed capacity in the Indian states of Rajasthan and Odisha.

5.1.3.5.2.2 Green bonds: issuance and allocation

In October 2015, EDF successfully placed the largest ever US dollar green
bond issue by an industrial company. With a maturity of 10 years, a total
amount of US$1.25 billion and an annual fixed coupon of 3.625%, this
new green bond will support further investment by the Group in renewable
energies. By 31 December 2015, US$500 million had been allocated to
construction of three wind farms.

The Group successfully issued its first green bond in Euros in November 2013,
raising €1.4 billion to finance EDF Energies Nouvelles’ renewable energy
projects. The total €1.4 billion had been allocated by 30 June 2015.

The funds raised by these two issues have financed a total of fifteen
renewable energy projects (wind power, photovoltaic solar power, and
biomethane plants), located in France and North America and developed
by EDF Energies Nouvelles. These projects represent total capacity of
nearly 2.1GW.

5.1.3.6 Regulatory environment

5.1.3.6.1 France

5.1.3.6.1.1 Energy transition Law for green growth

After a final reading, on 22 July 2015 the French National Assembly adopted
the energy transition Law for green growth, marking the end of a long
legislative process. The resulting law no. 2015-992 of 17 August 2015 on
the energy transition for green growth was promulgated in the Journal
officiel of 18 August 2015 after a decision by the Constitutional Council
of 13 August 2015.

5.1.3.6.1.2 The NOME Law and the ARENH system

Supplies of electricity to EDF's competitors under the ARENH scheme for
regulated access to nuclear power supplies concerned a volume of 12.3TWh
for the first half of 2015. This volume decreased substantially in the second
half of 2015 to 3.8TWh, principally because of the sharp decline in prices

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

on the wholesale market, which is becoming a more attractive source of
energy supplies, and also due to termination of framework contracts with
several suppliers. No ARENH applications were made at the end of 2015
for supplies in the first half of 2016.

The ARENH price has been set at €42/MWh since 1 January 2012, and is
intended to reflect the economic conditions of generation by the existing
nuclear fleet. The draft decree stipulating the valuation method for costs
making up the ARENH price was examined by France's Higher Energy Board
(CSE) on 19 June 2014, and has also been examined by France‘s Competition
Authority and the French Energy Regulator CRE. It is still under examination
by the European Commission, which must approve the price formula. The
French government has deferred the application date of the new decree until
the conclusions of discussions with the European Commission are available.

5.1.3.6.1.3 CSPE

The Contribution to the Public Electricity Service (Contribution au Service
Public de |'Electricité or CSPE) exists to compensate for certain public service
charges assigned to EDF in particular’. The CSPE is collected directly from
the end-user.

The CSPE system was reformed by the amended finance law for 2015,
published in the Journal officiel on 30 December 2015. The charges for
the public energy service (electricity and gas) will be incorporated into
the French national budget in 2016. The finance law introduces a special
“Energy Transition” budget item of €4.4 billion, which will be funded
in 2016 by the TICFE tax on consumption of electricity (Taxe intérieure sur
la consommation finale d'électricité), less €2 billion, plus 2.16% of the
TICGN tax on gas consumption (Taxe Intérieure de Consommation sur le Gaz
Naturel). This budget will cover expenses borne by obligated suppliers, such
as the additional cost associated with contracts obliging them to purchase
renewable energies and biogas, the difference between forecast and actual
expenses, the annual contribution to repayment of the accumulated shortfall
due to EDF, for which the schedule will be set by an official decision, and
reimbursement of CSPE advances for industrial operators who were exempt
prior to 2016. Solidarity charges, purchase obligations excluding renewable
energies, and the cost of applying the standard national tariffs to areas not
connected to France’s mainland network are covered by the national budget
through the €2 billion “Public Energy Service” budget item.

The law also introduces changes to energy taxes, increasing the TICGN and
coal tax in 2016 and 2017 and replacing the TICFE by the new CSPE. CSPE
rates are set at €22.5/MWh for 2016, €2/MWh, €5/MWh or €7.5/MWh
for electro-intensive users based on a criterion of kilowatthours per Euro.
of value added, and €0.5/MWh for hyper-electro-intensive users.

The draft “CSPE” decree was presented to France’s Higher Energy Board
(Conseil supérieur de I’énergie, or CSE) on 21 December 2015. Under this
proposed decree, the public financial organisation Caisse des Dépédts et
Consignations (CDC) would be required to make the payments to obligated
suppliers, one of which is EDF, and keep the “Public Energy Service” and
“Energy Transition” accounts. The CRE would be required to determine the
amount of the charges for the public energy service (actual and forecast).
The procedures for compensating obligated suppliers for these charges are
also laid down in the proposed decree.

The estimated amount of expenses to be covered by compensation for
EDF for 2015 is €6.3 billion, 7% more than in 2014. The main explanation
for this rise is the lower level of market prices, which increases the surplus
costs of energy covered by purchase obligations to be compensated by the
CSPE, and a rise in the volume output by photovoltaic and wind power
facilities. The amounts received during 2015 total €6.1 billion, 17.6% more
than in 2014. This rise principally results from the CSPE increase applicable
since 1 January 2015 (an increase of €3/MWh compared to 2014, taking
the CSPE to €19.5/MWh for the year 2015).

1. Local distribution companies and Electricité de Mayotte also make small contributions to the system.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

The agreement signed in early 2013 by EDF and the French authorities,
providing for progressive reimbursement to EDF by 31 December 2018 of
the receivable consisting of the CSPE shortfall at 31 December 2012 and the
costs of bearing this shortfall for the Group, was updated in late 2015 by a
ministerial letter received on 26 January 2016. The State has acknowledged
the further shortfalls that arose between 2013 and 2015 and the associated
interest, estimated at a total €644 million, and authorises EDF to allocate
this receivable to dedicated assets in 2016. The amount of the receivable
due to EDF is thus €5.9 billion at 31 December 2015 (see note 36.3 of the
consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2015). The repayment
schedule has been adjusted such that this receivable will be fully reimbursed
by 2020. It will be set out in a ministerial order.

5.1.3.6.1.4 “TURPE 4” Network access tariffs

On 28 May 2015 the French Energy Regulator (Commission de Régulation de
l'Energie — CRE) published its resolution on changes from 1 August 2015 in
the TURPE distribution tariffs, which were raised by 0.4%. This rise reflects
the stabilisation of the clearance coefficient for the income and expenses
adjustment account (CRCP'), and a 0.4% increase in inflation.

TURPE transmission tariffs were also increased by 2.4% from 1 August 2015,
again corresponding to 2% for the clearance of the CRCP, and 0.4% for
inflation.

On 7 May 2014, the CRE had also decided to apply an exceptional
50% reduction to the electricity transmission bills of industrial sites that
are large electricity consumers. This measure was initially applicable
from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015. In its decision of 11 June 2015 setting
the changes in TURPE transmission tariffs, the CRE extended this 50%
reduction for electro-intensive users to 31 December 2015. It is now laid
down in Article L.341-4-2 of the Energy Code introduced by Article 157
of the energy transition Law, and can be increased up to 90%. The loss of
income for RTE will be compensated through future tariff changes thanks
to the CRCP mechanism.

The CRE also began during 2015 to examine the future structure of tariffs for
using the public electricity networks (the TURPE 5 tariffs). On 22 July 2015
it presented its preliminary analyses on the TURPE 5 tariffs structure for a
consultation process. The responses, submitted by 25 September 2015,
specifically concerned the tariff structure, i.e. the way network costs are
allocated between different user types through tariff components, chiefly
extraction, injection, metering and management. A further consultation
will take place concerning the tariff scale itself.

5.1.3.6.1.5 Regulated electricity sales tariffs in France

On 15 July 2015 the CRE published its 2015 report on France's regulated
sales tariffs for electricity, in which it reported a tariff shortfall of €922 million
for 2014 in addition to previous shortfalls that had not been compensated.

A decision of 30 July 2015 set the regulated sales tariffs that took effect
from 1 August 2015. The average increases were 2.5% for the “blue”
residential customers’ tariffs, 0.9% for the “yellow” tariffs and 4% for
the “green” tariffs, while the “blue” tariffs for non-residential customers
remained unchanged.

31 December 2015 saw the end of the “yellow” and “green” regulated
tariffs. By 1 January 2016 around three quarters of the sites concerned had
signed a market-rate contract with their chosen supplier. The remaining
quarter who had not yet signed up with a supplier continued to receive
electricity from their former supplier, under a transitional contract valid for
a maximum period of six months.

isterial order concerning the cost of the Cigéo
storage project

On 15 January 2016 the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and
Energy issued an order setting the cost associated with implementation of
long-term management solutions for long-lived medium and high-level
radioactive waste under the Cigéo storage project at €25 billion under 2011
economic conditions. This cost valuation is required by Article L. 542-12 of
France's Energy Code.

The cost stated in the order constitutes an objective to be met by the
French Agency for Radioactive Waste Management (ANDRA), in compliance
with safety standards set by the Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN), in close
cooperation with operators of nuclear installations. In application of this
order, the cost of the Cigéo project will be regularly updated, at least at
each key milestone of the project's development (authorisation to create the
facility, commissioning, end of the “pilot industrial phase", safety reviews)
in accordance with the opinion of the ASN.

The cost of the Cigéo project set by the ministerial order is €25 billion
under the economic conditions of 2011. This figure replaces the estimated
benchmark cost of €20.8 billion used by the EDF group for its consolidated
financial statements at 31 December 2014 and 30 June 2015.

At 31 December 2015, the new cost figure has resulted in an increase
of around €820 million in the provisions for long-term radioactive waste
management established to cover future expenses relating to the Cigéo
deep storage project.

This increase in provisions has a negative impact of €509 million, net of
taxes, on EDF net income for 2015.

5.1.3.6.1.7 AGIRC-ARRCO agreement of 30 October 2015

On 30 October 2015 the social partners reached an agreement intended to
balance the accounts of the AGIRC-ARRCO public pension body.

This agreement contains several sets of measures, some of which apply
from 1 January 2016: smaller adjustments to pensions from 2016 to 2018,
moving the pension value adjustment date from 1 April to 1 November, a
lower return on plan assets, extending the basis for AGFF's contribution to
tranche C of the AGIRC scheme, and other measures aiming to improve
management of pension and related systems.

The special pension system for France's electricity and gas sector has been
affiliated to the AGIRC-ARRCO standard national system since 2005. Since
the new agreement does not change IEG beneficiaries’ pension rights, the
increase in obligations resulting from this affiliation, amounting to €1 billion,
is recorded in actuarial adjustments.

5.1.3.6.2 United Kingdom

On 19 March 2014, the British government confirmed that it was setting up
a capacity market. EDF Energy took part in the second capacity auction in
December 2015 for agreements starting from October 2019, with 94.6%
of its capacity or 8.8GW qualified.

In 2011, to meet its objectives in the fight against climate change, the British
government introduced a Carbon Price Support mechanism intended to
guarantee a minimum price for carbon, consisting of a tax added to the
price of CO, emission rights. The aim of this mechanism is to bring the
overall carbon price (emission right and tax) to £30/t in 2020, a target set
when the price of CO, stood at around £15/t. In March 2014, in view of
the significant decline in CO, prices on the markets, the British government
decided to cap the carbon tax at £18/t from April 2016 until 2020.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

During the week of 6 July 2015, the British Competition and Markets
Authority (CMA) published its provisional findings and proposals for possible
solutions as identified during its preliminary investigation into the “supply
and acquisition of energy in Great Britain”.

These provisional findings confirmed the lack of any significant effect
concerning generation, sharing generation and supply resources (vertical
integration) and the efficiency of wholesale electricity and gas markets.
However, the CMA provisionally reached the conclusion that the “weak
customer response” both by residential and very small business customers
gives suppliers a competitive advantage over inactive customers, and that
they exploit that advantage through their pricing policies.

The CMA therefore proposed 18 solutions, many of them stated only in
general terms at this stage, which will be the basis for consultation with
stakeholders. The majority of these potential solutions focus on selling
and the regulatory framework as expected, particularly measures that can
improve customer involvement. Later in the year, the CMA will publish a
provisional decision document covering all the solutions it will recommend
applying. This will be followed by a further consultation period.

In late September 2015, the regulatory deadline for publication of the CMA’s
final report, initially set at 25 December 2015, was put back to 25 June 2016.
This extension will enable the CMA to take the view of consumer associations
and industrial operators into account.

5.1.3.6.3 Belgium

Nuclear power plants

The Law of 18 December 2013 amending the Law of 2003 on the timetable
for withdrawal from nuclear energy laid down the principles of a three-party
agreement between Electrabel, EDF and the Belgian government defining
the terms for extension of operation by Tihange 1 (in which EDF Belgium
directly owns a 50% stake) to 2025, particularly the fees due by the owners
to the State. The agreement was signed on 12 March 2014 and sets out
the operating, financial and legal conditions of this extension.

In June 2015 the Belgian federal parliament approved the law (known as
“the first bill") to extend the operating lifetimes of the oldest nuclear reactors
in Belgium. On 30 November 2015, the Prime Minister's office announced
that an agreement had been reached between Electrabel and the federal
government to extend operations at Doel 1 and Doel 2, which are wholly-
owned by Electrabel, until 2025. Associations opposing this extension filed
an action to cancel this law before the Constitutional Court. The Council
of State, in its opinion on this bill, expressed doubts as to its compatibility
with European law.

In parallel to the decision to extend operations by Doel 1 and Doel 2, an
agreement was reached concerning the nuclear annuity, which affects
EDF Luminus for the Tihange 2, Doel 3 and Doel 4 plants. The agreement sets
a transitional period for 2015 and 2016, when the nuclear tax is a standard
amount (€200 million in 2015 and €130 million in 2016) followed for the
years 2017 to 2026 by a variable nuclear operator's contribution, consisting
of 38% (before a sliding scale) of the margin generated by nuclear activities,
with a guaranteed minimum for the State which is set at €150 million for
the three-year period 2017 to 2019.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

Thermal power plants

The Belgian government organised a strategic reserve through a call for
tenders from thermal power plants that had announced their temporary
or permanent shutdown, in order to secure the country’s energy supply
during the winter periods. In 2014 the Seraing CCGT plant, fully-owned
by EDF Luminus, was selected for a 3-year period starting in winter 2014,
ending preparations for the plant's temporary shutdown announced
in March 2013. The open cycle plants Izegem and Angleur 3, also fully-owned
by EDF Luminus, were selected in the 2015 call for tenders for a 1-year period
from winter 2015. Since 1 November 2015, the three selected power plants
can be activated by the Belgian network operator Elia at any moment in
the event of a risk of energy shortages during the winter.

Offshore wind farms

The Belgian government has reached an agreement on a new system of
subsidies for offshore wind farms. Firms will receive fewer subsidies. The
aim of reducing subsidies for offshore wind farms is to avoid further rises
in the cost of electricity for consumers.

Nuclear plants in Belgium

After 10 months of outage for the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear power
plants (in which EDF Luminus holds 10.2% drawing rights) for inspections
of the reactor vessels, which had been found to have microcracks during
the summer of 2012, the Federal Nuclear Control Agency (AFCN) gave its
authorisation on 17 May 2013 for both plants to resume operation. The
operator Electrabel had agreed on a battery of additional tests with the
AFCN to evaluate the long-term behaviour of the reactor vessels. Since
one of the tests conducted did not give the results experts had expected,
Electrabel took the initiative on 25 March 2014 to shut both plants down
temporarily as a precautionary measure until further test results were
available. On 13 May 2015 Electrabel issued a statement that the shutdown
of Doel 3 and Tihange 2 would be extended to 1 November 2015, to give
the AFCN further time to finalise the additional analyses.

On 17 November 2015, the AFCN announced its authorisation for resumption
of operation by Doel 3 and Tihange 2 until 2022 and 2023, the date set
for their final shutdown. Further tests are to be conducted during the next
reactor outage in September 2016 and February 2017. Both plants were
in operation in January 2016.

sales in 2015, compared to 45.6% in 2014.

5.1.4.1.2.1 France

Change in sales in the France segment

France's contribution to Group sales amounted to €39,619 million,
corresponding to an organic decline of €115 million (-0.3%) compared
to 2014. Excluding the €908 million impact of 2012-2013 regulated sales
tariffs which were recognised in 2014, sales showed organic growth of 2.0%
(€793 million). This growth mainly results from favourable weather effects
with a €562 million impact, reflected in higher sales volumes (+7.7TWh).

Sales revenues benefited from the rise in tariffs (€724 million), but were
adversely affected by falling market prices resulting in lower volumes sold
under the ARENH system (-55TWh) and an equivalent rise in volumes sold
at market prices.

Gas sales to final customers increased by €99 million, largely driven by the
weather (+0.6TWh).

At 31 December 2015, EDF's volume market share for electricity sales to all
final customers was 77.4%, down by 1.4 point from 31 December 2014.
EDF's share of the natural gas market was 5.0%, a year-on-year gain of

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

There was a 1.1% organic decline in sales by the deregulated activities.
Excluding the €881 million impact of 2012-2013 regulated sales tariffs
which were recognised in 2014, sales showed an organic increase of 1.3%
(€467 million) driven by colder weather in the early part of the year compared
to 2014. It also reflects the higher energy component in regulated tariffs
at 1 November 2014 and 1 August 2015.

Sales by the network activities were up by 2.0%, as the transmission volumes
rose due to the colder weather at the start of 2015 compared to 2014.

Electricity generation

Nuclear generation produced 416.8TWh in 2015, compared to 415.9TWh
for 2014, an increase of +0.9TWh. This surpassed the Group's 410-415TWh
target announced to the market for 2015. This improvement was achieved
by controlling the duration of scheduled outages.

Hydropower output stood at 32.1TWh, down by 5.4TWh from 2014 due
to less favourable hydrological conditions (see section 5.1.2.4 “Weather
conditions: temperatures and rainfall”).

Fossil-fired thermal generation produced 6.8TWh, -0.1TWh less than in 2014.

Sales volumes to final customers (a market segment that includes local
distribution firms) were up by +1.2TWh, including +7.9TWh resulting from
the temperature differential. The impact of lost customers was -7.8TWh,
including -5.4TWh concerning customers who paid the regulated “yellow”
and “green” tariffs.

The effects of discontinuation of the VPP' system, which had begun in 2012,
caused a 2.7TWh downturn in sales compared to 2014. Electricity supplies
under the ARENH system totalled 16.2TWh, 55.1TWh less than in 2014.

EDF was a net seller on the wholesale markets to the extent of 82.7TWh.
The 55.8TWh increase in market sales compared to 2014 is explained by a
54.5TWh decline in structured demand (ARENH supplies).

5.1.4.1.2.2 United Kingdom

The United Kingdom’s contribution to Group sales amounted to
€11,618 million in 2015, an increase of €949 million including a foreign
exchange effect of €1,129 million. The organic change was -1.7% compared
to 2014.

The primary reason for the lower level of sales is the decrease in electricity
sales to final customers, which reflects the falling customer numbers resulting
from strong competition, and lower gas tariffs.

5.1.4.1.2.3 Italy

Italy contributed €11,677 million to consolidated sales, down by 8.0%
from 2014 (-8.1% in organic terms).

This decrease, which principally concerns Edison, was essentially driven by
the market context, which saw a sharp drop in brent oil prices and falling
average sales prices on the electricity and gas markets.

In the electricity business, sales were down by 18%, mainly due to the fall
in sale prices, but also due to a decrease in volumes.

In the hydrocarbon business, in contrast, sales increased by 9%: demand
recovered after the significantly negative weather effect experienced in 2014
which had a strong impact on volumes sold to residential customers and
thermal power plants. This trend, combined with a high increase in sales
volumes on the wholesale markets, more than offset the fall in gas and
brent oil prices.

Fenice registered sales of €387 million, an organic decline of -€9 million
compared to 2014.

5.1.4.1.2.4 Other international

The Other international segment principally covers operations in Europe,
excluding the United Kingdom and Italy, and operations in the United States,
Brazil and Asia (China, Vietnam and Laos).

This segment contributed €5,634 million to Group sales in 2015, €31 million
or +0.6% more than in 2014. Excluding foreign exchange effects (-€3 million)
and changes in the scope of consolidation (+€52 million), sales declined by
0.3% in organic terms from 2014.

The downturn essentially comes from:

= Asia (-€74 million organic decline), where the decrease in sales is
essentially explained by the handover of the Figlec concession in early
September 2015;

® Brazil (-€9 million organic decline), due to the lower spot market prices;

m Hungary (-€23 million organic decline), where sales were affected by
the decrease in regulated tariffs for electricity and heat introduced in
the second half of 2014, and the lower market prices for electricity
associated with declining gas prices.

In Belgium, in contrast, sales registered organic growth of €62 million.
The rise in gas volumes sold, driven by a very positive weather effect, and
‘the growth in business for auxiliary services largely offset the fall in wholesale
market prices for electricity and gas.

Poland also saw organic growth of €26 million in its sales, thanks to higher
electricity prices and heat tariffs.

5.1.4.1.2.5 Other activities

Other activities comprise, among other entities, EDF Energies Nouvelles,
EDF Trading, Electricité de Strasbourg and Dalkia.

The contribution by the Other activities segment to Group sales amounted
to €6,458 million in 2015, an increase of €1,944 million or 43.1% from 2014,
corresponding to organic growth of €19 million (+0.4%). The effect of
changes in scope totalled +€1,833 million and mostly reflects the takeover
of Dalkia’s activities in France from July 2014.

EDF Energies Nouvelles’ contribution to Group sales showed an
organic increase of €14 million (+1.7%) compared to 2014. In 2015
EDF Energies Nouvelles continued to develop its operation and maintenance
activity.

EDF Trading's sales also showed an organic decline of €210 million (-24.5%)
from 2014, explained by a poorer performance on the North American
market after the particularly good levels of business in 2014, and difficult
market conditions, particularly in Europe.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

Sales by Electricité de Strasbourg totalled €802 million, with organic
growth of €33 million (+4.3%) compared to 2014. The rise was mainly
attributable to the higher volumes of electricity and gas sold as a result of
more favourable weather early in the year in 2015 than 2014.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

Dalkia contributed €2,878 million to Group sales, reflecting the takeover
of Dalkia’s activities in France from 25 July 2014. The organic decline of
€70 million! (-5.3%) is principally explained by a downturn in energy prices
and the industrial work activity, which was not offset by the positive impact

Sales by the gas activities amounted to €594 million in 2015, compared to of commercial development.

€191 million in 2014. These activities were part of the “France” segment in
the first half of 2014. The organic growth of €227 million corresponds to an
increase in volumes, driven by a favourable weather effect and optimisation
of storage activities.

5.1.4.2 Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)

EBITDA rose by 1.9%, with an organic decrease of -0.6%. Excluding the impact of the regulated tariff catch-up for 2012-2013 recognised in 2014, organic
growth was 3.9%.

5.1.4.2.1 Change in consolidated EBITDA and analysis

Consolidated EBITDA for 2015 amounted to €17,601 million, up by 1.9%
from 2014. After adjustment for the positive €155 million scope effect,
essentially related to the takeover of Dalkia’s activities in France in July 2014
and favourable foreign exchange effects of €271 million, mainly resulting
from the pound sterling's rise against the Euro, organic growth was -0.6%.

The Group's fuel and energy purchases amounted to €38,775 million
in 2015, up by €1,562 million (+4.2%) from 2014, or an organic increase
of €415 million (+1.1%). In France, the organic increase of €1,144 million
(+7.6%) is essentially driven by obligations to purchase renewable energies,
nuclear fuel costs and ERDF network access costs. Italy registered an organic
decline of €793 million (-7.4%), essentially due to the fall in prices and the
arbitration ruling on the Libyan gas contract, which offset the effect of
higher fuel and energy purchase volumes. The organic decrease observed
in the United Kingdom (€173 million or -2.8%) relates to the organic
downturn in sales.

Other external expenses amounted to €9,526 million for 2015,
€345 million (+3.8%) higher than in 2014 but corresponding to an organic
decline of €464 million (-5.1%). In the United Kingdom, the organic
decrease of €156 million (-12.9%) reflects EDF Energy's efforts to control
its costs, the lower year-on-year charges on the ECO energy efficiency
programme, and costs associated with inspections and repairs of steam

decrease of €112 million mainly relates to an operating cost-cutting plan.
In France, the €81 million decline (-1.5%) reflects efforts made to reduce
costs, particularly in thermal generation and commercial activities.

The Group’s personnel expenses totalled €12,529 million, an increase
of €744 million from 2014, or €166 million (+1.4%) in organic growth.
In France, personnel expenses totalled €9,209 million, an organic rise of
€138 million (+1.5%) compared to 2014, notaby due to growth in the
workforce, particularly in the nuclear activities in 2014. Excluding the Linky
project, the workforce was 0.5% lower than in 2014, thanks to efforts in
the thermal generation, commercial and general functions.

Taxes other than income taxes amounted to €3,641 million for 2015, up
by €48 million or +1.3% from 2014 (+0.6% in organic growth).

Other operating income and expenses generated net income of
€7,066 million for 2015, up by €1,398 million from 2014 (an organic rise
of €1,355 million or +23.9%). In France, other operating income and
expenses registered organic growth of €610 million, particularly because
of the rise in the CSPE. In Italy the organic rise was €588 million, mainly
attributable to the effects in 2015 of arbitration concerning the long-term
gas contract with Libya, and a significant reduction in bad debt following
action to recover outstanding payments. The Other activities segment saw
an organic increase of €278 million, principally as a result of real estate sales.

Change in EBITDA for the France segment

France contributed €11,517 million of consolidated EBITDA for 2015, down by 5.6% (organic decline of -6.0%) compared to 2014. After eliminating the
effect of the regulated sales tariff catch-up for the period 23 July 2012 to 31 July 2013 following the Council of State's decision of 11 April 2014, which

was recorded in 2014 in the amount of €731 million, EBITDA was stable.

The France segment's contribution represented 65.4% of EBITDA in 2015 compared to 70.6% in 2014.

EBI

FOR THE FRANCE SEGMENT

EBITDA for the generation and supply (deregulated) activities was down
by 12.5%. After adjustment for the €731 million impact of the regulated
sales tariff catch-up for 2012-2013 recognised in 2014 and the €53 million
scope effect related to the transfer of upstream gas portfolio management
activities to the “Other activities” segment, EBITDA was down by €317 million
or -4.4%.

The good performance by nuclear generation +0.9TWh and more favourable
weather conditions (+7.9TWh) had a combined effect of +€41 million.
Hydropower output, in contrast, was down by 5.4TWh (-€207 million).

2015 was marked by less favourable market conditions which had a
-€437 million impact. With the discontinuation of the “yellow” and “green”
regulated sales tariffs, losses of customers (-7.9TWH) had a negative impact
of -€149 million. The decline in market prices led to lower volumes sold
under the ARENH system and an equivalent increase in sales at market
prices. The impact of lower take-up of the ARENH system amounted to
approximately -€230 million in 2015.

1. Further details of this breakdown can be found in section 5.1.4.1.2.1

EDF | 2015 Reference Document

12,198 (681)

These effects were counterbalanced by the rise in regulated sales tariffs
at 1 November 2014 and 1 August 2015 which contributed +€800 million
to EBITDA.

The growth in other external purchases and personnel expenses was
controlled (+0.1%). Cost adjustment campaigns have been initiated,
particularly in the commercial and thermal generation activities and general
functions.

A final factor in the decrease in EBITDA for the deregulated activities was the
non-recurring changes in provisions, including for nuclear fuel processing.

EBITDA for the network activities increased by +7.8%. This rise is explained
by the less mild weather in the early part of the year in 2015 than 2014
(+€122 million), a lower cost of purchases to compensate for network losses
due to falling electricity market prices, and favourable changes in provisions
and non-recurring expenses.

EBITDA for the island activities was up by €36 million (+5.1%), primarily
due to new power plants commissioned by the subsidiary EDF Production
Electrique Insulaire (EDF PEI).

5.1.4.2.2.2 United Kingdom

The United Kingdom's contribution to Group EBITDA for 2015 was
€2,242 million, up by +15.5% from 2014 corresponding to organic growth of
+4.9%. The decline in the Euro against the pound sterling had a favourable
impact of €205 million compared to 2014.

Nuclear generation output amounted to 60.6TWh for 2015, a rise of
+4.4TWh over 2014. This increase essentially resulted from the end of
inspection and repair work on the steam generators at the Heysham 1
and Hartlepool power plants: three of the reactors resumed operation in
late 2014, and the fourth in early 2015. Generation by the rest of the nuclear
fleet registered a very good operating performance.

EDF Energy also began a cost saving plan across all activities and successfully
reduced its charges under the ECO energy efficiency programme in 2015.

5.1.4.2.2.3 Italy

The Italy segment contributed €1,345 million to the Group’s consolidated
EBITDA, 51.8% more than in 2014 corresponding to organic growth
of 51.5%.

This movement essentially concerned Edison, and includes the €855 million
positive effects of the international arbitration court's decision in the
dispute between Edison and ENI over revision of the long-term Libyan gas
contract prices.

This growth in EBITDA covers contrasting situations across the different
activities.

EBITDA for the electricity activities reflects a contraction in margins on
thermal power generation, less favourable hydrological conditions than
the exceptionally good weather conditions of 2014, and an adverse trend
in average sales prices.

In contrast, EBITDA in the hydrocarbon activities registered a rise of
€749 million. The positive impact of the arbitration decision was partly
counterbalanced by falling brent oil prices which adversely affected
exploration and production activities.

A cost-cutting plan was also implemented from the start of the year, to
adapt to the new market situation.

Excluding the effects of revisions of Russian contract prices in 2014 and Libyan
contract prices in 2015, the rise in EBITDA for the hydrocarbon activities was
€294 million. EBITDA for the overall Italy segment was nonetheless stable
despite an unfavourable price environment.

Fenice contributed €85 million to Group EBITDA in 2015, a decrease of
1.2% from 2014 due to unfavourable foreign exchange effects, but an
organic increase of 1.2%.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

5.1.4.2.2.4 Other international

EBITDA for the Other international segment stood at €609 million in 2015,
a decrease of 3.6% from 2014 corresponding to an organic decline of -3.5%.

This change was essentially attributable to Asia, with the end of the Figlec
concession in early September 2015, and Brazil, where the €26 million
organic decline in EBITDA principally related to the maintenance programme
of 2015 which had no equivalent in 2014. The impact of falling electricity
prices on the spot market was counterbalanced by the decrease in the
purchase price for gas.

In contrast, EBITDA for Belgium showed an organic rise of €44 million,
thanks to progression in wind power output following the start of
operations by new facilities (+37% of installed wind power capacity since
31 December 2014) and the rise in business for auxiliary services. EBITDA was
affected by the shutdown since 25 March 2014 of the Doel 3 and Tihange
2 plants, which only received authorisation to restart in December 2015.

There was an organic rise of €37 million in EBITDA in Poland, thanks to
better margins due to higher prices and control of operating costs.

5.1.4.2.2.5 Other activities

Other activities contributed €1,888 million to Group EBITDA for 2015, an
organic rise of 6.2% from 2014.

EDF Energies Nouvelles’ contribution to consolidated EBITDA totalled
€818 million in 2015. The organic year-on-year growth of €69 million
(+10.0%) was mainly driven by higher generation output following
commissioning of new facilities in 2015, good weather conditions in Europe
and active business in Development and Sales of Structured Assets.

EBITDA at EDF Trading amounted to €495 million in 2015, an organic
decline of €139 million (-22.0%) from 2014. This decrease is directly
associated with a deterioration of the trading margin observed on sales
(see section 5.1.4.1.2.5) which was partly offset by gains on sales made
in 2015.

Dalkia contributed €217 million to Group EBITDA, corresponding to organic
growth of €38 million’ compared to 2014, notably achieved through
operating efficiency and commercial development plans.

Sales of real estate property in 2015 also contributed to the organic growth
in Group EBITDA.

Other income and expenses (885) (212) (673) $317.5
EBIT 4,280 84 (3,704) 4

The Group's consolidated EBIT amounted to €4,280 million for 2015,
down by €3,704 million from 2014. This decrease is primarily explained
by higher net depreciation and amortisation, especially in France and the
United Kingdom, and an increase in impairment.

5.1.4.3.1 Net changes in fair value on Energy
and Commodity derivatives,
excluding trading activities

The net changes in fair value on Energy and Commodity derivatives,
excluding trading activities, decreased from +€203 million in 2014 to
+€175 million in 2015. This change was mainly located in Italy, where it
concerned economic hedging of the industrial gas portfolio. It principally
reflects settlement upon maturity of economic hedging instruments that
generated positive results in 2014, plus the change in positive fair value of
hedging instruments hedging gas positions beyond 2015.

5.1.4.3.2 Net depreciation and amortisation

Net depreciation and amortisation was €1,069 million higher than in 2014.

France registered a €347 million increase in net depreciation and
amortisation, essentially explained by investments in the generation fleet
(new industrial facilities commissioned and nuclear maintenance) and
distribution assets.

In the United Kingdom, the €409 million rise in net depreciation and
amortisation (an organic increase of €303 million) essentially reflects the
higher investments in maintenance for nuclear plants and coal-fired plants.

In Italy, net depreciation and amortisation was up by €142 million, particularly
due to the rise in exploration expenses.

The €95 million increase in EBITDA in the Other activities segment essentially
relates to the inclusion of Dalkia in the consolidation since July 2014.

282

EDF | 2015 Reference Document

5.1.4.3.3 Net increase: provisions for renewal
of property, plant and equipment operated
under concessions

The €55 million decrease between 2014 and 2015 in the net increases in
provisions for renewal of property, plant and equipment operated under
concessions is mainly attributable to ERDF.

5.1.4.3.4 Impairment/reversals

In 2015, impairment amounted to €3,500 million and principally concerned:

m the United Kingdom (€1,096 million). In view of the low additional
income generated by the capacity premium mechanism, the narrower
spreads on forward and long-term horizons and the lack of an upward
market response to the 2015 announcement of reduced operating time
for certain assets, impairment of €811 million was booked in respect of
the Cottam and West Burton A coal-fired power plants, and to a lesser
extent the West Burton B gas-fired plant commissioned in 2013. Finally,
lower volatility levels affected the possible benefits of flexibility in gas
storage cavities, leading to recognition of impairment of €285 million
on gas storage assets;

= Edison (€1,419 million). Poor market conditions that led to significantly
reduced options for asset portfolio optimisation, low demand, and
downward revision of the capacity premium led to recognition of
€868 million of impairment, mainly concerning the thermal, hydropower
and wind power plants. In view of the long-term downturn in brent
crude oil and gas prices over the market horizon, impairment of
€551 million was also recorded on Edison's exploration-production
activities;

m Poland (€206 million). The worsening of clean dark spreads adversely
affected performance at certain Polish fossil-fired plants, particularly
facilities that are fully exposed to market prices.

Details of other impairment are given in note 13 to the 2015 consolidated
financial statements, “Impairment/reversals”.

In 2014, impairment amounted to €1,189 million and essentially concerned:

= Belgium: €586 million in respect of the subsidiary EDF Luminus, due to
the deterioration in long-term market price assumptions;

= the United Kingdom: €169 million in respect of the West Burton B

of site security and unfavourable market conditions;

= Edison: €167 million, mostly in respect of hydropower and wind power
assets, which were affected by falling market prices.

5.1.4.3.5 Other income and expenses

Other income and expenses generated a net expense of €885 million in 2015,
compared to €212 million in 2014.

In 2015, the main components of other income and expenses were:

= a €820 million increase to provisions following the decision of
15 January 2016 concerning the cost of implementing long-term
management solutions for long-lived medium and high-level radioactive
waste under the Cigéo storage project (see section 5.1.3.6.1.6 “Ministerial
order concerning the cost of the Cigéo storage project");

5.1.4.4 Financial result

scenario and contractor quotes for decommissioning nuclear power plants.
that are permanently shut down, less a reversal of €332 million from the
provision for long-term radioactive waste management resulting from
updating of this scenario, giving a net effect of €258 million;

= income of €287 million in connection with the agreement signed
on 30 June 2015 between EDF and Engie concerning the compensation
system for employee benefits in kind in the form of energy. This
agreement entailed a contractual change in the number of beneficiaries
covered by the Group;

= income of €154 million associated with the change in EDF Energy's
defined-benefit pension plans.

Other income and expenses in 2014 included:

= again on sale of €217 million from operations in connection with the
Group's investment in Dalkia;

= an expense of €388 million relating to decommissioning of French
nuclear power plants that have been permanently shut down (natural
uranium graphite gas-cooled (UNGG) plants, Creys-Malville, Brennilis
and Chooz A).

Other financial income and expenses 2,218 2,688 (470) -17.5
FINANCIAL RESULT (2,588) (2,551 (37)

The financial result for 2015 corresponds to a financial expense of
€2,588 million, €37 million more than in 2014. This change is explained by:

= a decrease in net indebtedness due notably to the positive impact of
variabilisation of the debt;

= a €184 million decrease in discount expenses compared to 2014,
essentially concerning provisions for employee benefits;

= a€470 million downturn in other financial income and expenses, as the
increase in capital gains on divestment of dedicated assets was more
than outweighed by the €360 million financial interest associated with
the European Commission’s decision of 22 July 2015 (see section 5.1.3.1
“European commission decision on the tax treatment of provisions
established between 1987 and 1996 for renewal of the General
Network").

5.1.4.5 Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to €483 million, corresponding to an effective tax
rate of 28.5% in 2015. The effective tax rate was 33.8% in 2014.

The effective tax rate was driven up by impairment; after adjustment to
eliminate this factor, it stood at 24.3% in 2015 compared to 32.2% in 2014.

The main explanations for the fall in the effective tax rate between 2014 and
2015 are the lower income tax rate and cancellation of the “Robin Hood”
tax in Italy, and the lower income tax rate in the United Kingdom.

5.1.4.6 Share in net income of associates
and joint ventures

The Group's share in net income of associates and joint ventures was a
positive €192 million in 2015, compared to €179 million in 2014. This
rise essentially results from higher year-on-year net income at RTE, as the
weather was more favourable than in 2014.

The share in net income of associates in 2015 also includes impairment
totalling €549 million, including:

= Alpiq (€196 million). Against a background of persistently low prices
on the wholesale markets, the Group booked impairment in respect of
Alpiq’s Swiss assets, corresponding to its share of the impairment recorded
in Alpiq’s published financial statements at 30 June 2015.

If the Alpiq group finds itself obliged to recognise additional impairment
in its consolidated financial statements for 2015, the EDF group
will be obliged to reflect that in its half-yearly financial statements
at 30 June 2016 ;

= CENG (€271 million). This impairment was booked in view of lower
forward prices and long-term electricity prices caused by the long-term
decline in gas prices.

In 2014 impairment of €425 million was recorded, including €206 million in
respect of Alpiq, €122 million on CENG and €83 million on the investment
in the joint venture Estag (Austria).

Changes in financial assets

The overall change in financial assets in 2015 was -€5,600 million, principally
reflecting the acquisition of liquid assets.

In 2014, the -€294 million change in financial assets essentially reflected
the Group‘s investments in construction of the South Stream gas pipeline
(which have since been sold) and the ultra-supercritical coal-fired power
plant on the Fuzhou site in China.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

Cash flows related to financing activities generated a net inflow of
€5,574 million in 2015, an increase of €4,351 million from 2014. This
change primarily reflects:

® an increase of €7,662 million in issuance of borrowings (net of
redemptions);

m the issuance of perpetual subordinated bonds in 2014 which had
no equivalent in 2015;

= the lower level of dividends paid in cash by EDF in 2015 compared
to 2014.

Changes in the Group’s net indebtedness were as follows:

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

5.1.5.2. Net indebtedness

Net indebtedness comprises total loans and financial liabilities, less cash
and cash equivalents and liquid assets. Liquid assets are financial assets
consisting of funds or securities with initial maturity of over three months
that are readily convertible into cash and are managed according to a
liquidity-oriented policy. It also includes the Group’s loan to RTE.

The Group’s net indebtedness stood at €37,395 million at 31 December 2015
compared to €34,208 million at 31 December 2014.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

5.1.5.2.1 Operating cash flow

The operating cash flow amounted to €13,502 million in 2015 compared
to €11,691 million in 2014, an increase of €1,811 million (+15.5%).

This change mainly reflects:

m the rise in EBITDA (+€322 million), and lower eliminations of
non-monetary items included in EBITDA (-€1,610 million in 2015,
compared to -€1,901 million in 2014), notably due to the closing of
favourable positions on trading activities recorded in late 2014;

= the lower level of net financial expenses disbursed (€1,252 million in 2015
compared to €1,752 million in 2014), essentially explained by the full-
year effect in 2015 of the campaign to variabilise rates on borrowings
between January and June 2014;

™ a decrease in income taxes paid (-€1,508 million in 2015 versus
-€2,614 million in 2014), essentially as a result of differences in France
in the balance of income tax due for previous years, and the lower
advance instalments of income tax paid in France in 2015 as a result of
lower taxable income.

These rises were partly offset by the lower amount of dividends received
(-€350 million), primarily explained by the exceptional dividend received
from CENG in 2014 which had no equivalent in 2015.

5.1.5.2.2 Change in working capital

The change in working capital over 2015 amounted to +€132 million, and
is mainly explained by:

= collection of trade receivables related to the regulated sales tariff catch-up
for 2012-2013 (increase of +€775 million);

® gains resulting from the working capital improvement plan, essentially
on inventories and trade receivables (approximately +€700 million);

= anunfavourable foreign exchange and price effect on uranium in France
and the United Kingdom (approximately -€400 million);

m the rise in the CSPE operating receivable (-€230 million);
= the weather impact in France, which was not very significant in 2015;
® other operating effects (approximately -€300 million).

The difference between the 2015 and 2014 change in working capital
(+€1,173 million) essentially results from the favourable effect of the
regulated sales tariff catch-up for 2012-2013 (approximately +€1.8 billion),
gains resulting from the working capital improvement plan (approximately
-€350 million), and an unfavourable price and foreign exchange effect
in 2015 on nuclear fuel inventories in France and the United Kingdom
(approximately -€200 million).

5.1.5.2.3 Net investments

Net investments amounted to €12,672 million in 2015 compared to €11,887 million in 2014, an increase of €785 million (+6.6%). Details are as follows:

(1) 2014 figures are restated, principally by eliminating net investments in the UK Nuclear New Build programme, which are now included in new developments.

In France, net investments were up by +€265 million or +3%.

= Inthe generation and supply (deregulated) activities, the increase in net
investments (+€110 million) mainly resulted from nuclear maintenance
activities.

= In the network activities, the rise in net investments (+€163 million)
primarily resulted from payments made during 2015 for investments
undertaken in late 2014. The lower investments in customer connections
were offset by higher investments to improve network coverage quality
and network reinforcement.

288

EDF | 2015 Reference Document

In the International segment, net investments were up by €1,075 million
or +69.7%.

m In the United Kingdom, the increase of €134 million or +13.7% is largely
explained by an unfavourable foreign exchange effect.

® In Italy, the rise of €507 million was principally due to development of
projects already launched in exploration-production, and sales of assets
during 2014 which had no equivalent in 2015.


--- Page 28 ---

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

= The increase in the Other International segment’s net investments
(+€434 million) is notably explained by investments to bring coal-fired
and cogeneration plants in Poland up to the latest standards, and
investments in Belgium relating to reorganisation of EDF Luminus’
shareholding structure.

In the Other activities segment, net investments were down by €373 million
or -31.1%. This decrease primarily resulted from EDF Energies Nouvelles,
where the ongoing capacity development required high levels of investment
but benefited from higher subsidies received in 2015, mainly for wind farm
projects in the United States.

New developments and asset disposals correspond to the Group‘s new
development projects and sales of assets undertaken to fund them. They
also include Linky investments. In 2015 and 2014 these new developments
mainly concerned New Nuclear investments in the United Kingdom, and to a
smaller degree investments in Linky meters and offshore wind farm projects.
Asset disposals essentially concerned real estate property, sales of assets
by EDF Trading and sales of the Group’s investments in Estag and BE Zrt.

5.1.5.2.4 French General Electricity Network

Following the European Commission's decision of 22 July 2015 classifying
the tax treatment of provisions established between 1987 and 1996 for
renewal of the General Network facilities as state aid that is incompatible
with European Union rules, EDF repaid the sums demanded: the amount
of the state aid (€889 million) plus interest (€494 million) as calculated on
terms set by the Commission.

The impact relating to the French General Network totals €906 million,
comprising:

= payment to the State of €1,383 million, which was partly offset by a
reimbursement of €375 million received from RTE;

® a tax saving of €102 million associated with the decline in taxable income.

5.1.5.2.5 Dedicated assets

In compliance with the French law no. 2006-739 of 28 June 2006 on the
sustainable management of radioactive materials and waste, EDF has built up
a portfolio of dedicated assets for secure financing of its long-term nuclear
obligations which amounted to €23,480 million at 31 December 2015.

Overall, the changes in dedicated assets comprise:
® allocations to reach full coverage of obligations;

= reinvestment of financial income (dividends and interest) generated by
these assets;

= withdrawals of assets corresponding to the costs incurred over the period
in application of long-term nuclear obligations falling within the scope
of the Law of 28 June 2006;

= exceptional withdrawals proposed to the governance bodies in charge
of managing dedicated assets when the value of the portfolio exceeds
the amount of the obligations to be financed; such withdrawals must
be validated by these bodies.

The net movements of €217 million in 2015 correspond to the second and
third types of change described above.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

5.1.5.2.6 Cash flow before dividends

The cash flow before dividends in 2015 was positive at €273 million
(compared to a negative €1,063 million in 2014) and is mainly explained
by the following factors:

= operating cash flow of +€13,502 million;
= net investments of -€12,672 million;

m= the payment related to the French General Network with a net effect
of -€906 million.

The +€1,336 million improvement from 2014 is essentially due to the
€1,811 million increase in operating cash flow, although this effect was
reduced by the payment related to the French General Network in 2015
(-€906 million).

5.1.5.2.7 Dividends paid in cash

Dividends paid in cash during 2015 (-€2,337 million) comprise:
m the balance of the 2014 dividends (€1,268 million);

@ the interim dividend for 2015 (€152 million) decided by the Board of
Directors on 4 November 2015 and paid on 18 December 2015 at the
rate of €0.57 per share;

™ payments made in 2015 to bearers of perpetual subordinated bonds
for the “hybrid” bond issues of January 2013 and January 2014
(€591 million);

= dividends paid by Group subsidiaries to their minority shareholders
(€326 million).

The favourable difference of €607 million compared to 2014 is principally
attributable to payment of the interim dividend for 2015 in the form of a
scrip dividend to 85.63% of shareholders.

5.1.5.2.8 Group cash flow

The Group cash flow after dividends amounted to -€2,064 million compared
to -€4,007 in 2014. The €1,943 million improvement primarily reflects the
€1,336 million change in cash flow before dividends and €607 million
decrease on dividends paid in cash.

5.1.5.2.9 Effect of change in exchange rate

The foreign exchange effect (rise of the pound sterling and US dollar against
the Euro') had an unfavourable impact of -€951 million on the Group’s net
indebtedness at 31 December 2015.

1. The pound sterling rose by 6.1% against the Euro, from €1.284/£1 at 31 December 2014 to €1.362/£1 at 31 December 2015.
The US dollar rose by 11.5% against the Euro, from €0.824/$1 at 31 December 2014 to €0.919/$1 at 31 December 2015.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

5.1.6 MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL
OF MARKET RISKS

5.1.6.1 Management and control

of financial risks

This section sets forth the policies and principles for management of the
Group's financial risks defined in the Strategic Financial Management
Framework (liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange rate and equity risks),
and the Group counterparty risk management policy set up by the EDF group.
These principles apply only to EDF and operationally controlled subsidiaries
or subsidiaries that do not benefit by law from specific guarantees of
independent management such as ERDF. In compliance with IFRS 7, the
following paragraphs describe the nature of risks resulting from financial
instruments, based on analyses of sensitivities and credit (counterparty) risks.

Since 2002, a dedicated body — the Financial Risks Control Department
(Département Contréle des Risques Financiers et Investissements — CRFl)
— has been in charge of financial risk control at Group level by ensuring
correct application of the principles of the Strategic Financial Management
Framework (July 2015). This department, which has reported to the Group’s
Risk Division since 2008, is an independent unit that also has the task of
carrying out a second-level check (methodology and organisation) of EDF
entities and operationally controlled Group subsidiaries (excluding ERDF), and
a first-level check of financing activities at parent company level, including
trading room activities.

The CRFI Department issues daily monitoring reports of risk indicators
relevant to activities in EDF's trading room.

Regular internal audits are carried out to ensure controls are actually applied
and are effective.

5.1.6.1.1 Liquidity position and management
of liquidity risks

5.1.6.1.1.1 Liquidity position

At 31 December 2015, the Group's liquidities, consisting of liquid assets,
cash and cash equivalents, totalled €22,323 million and available credit lines
amounted to €11,380 million.

For 2016, the Group's scheduled debt repayments (principal and interest) are
forecast at €12,799 million at 31 December 2015, including €3,751 million
for bonds (excluding hybrid bonds).

At 31 December 2015, no Group company was in default on any borrowing.

5.1.6.1.1.2 Management of li

On 18 April 1996, EDF set up a programme to issue debt securities in the
form of Euro Medium Term Notes (the “EMTN" programme). This programme
was regularly renewed until May 2009, when an EMTN programme governed
by French law was established for EDF's EMTN issues from that date. The
new programme has also been regularly renewed since then, and its current
ceiling is €45 billion.

On 25 September 2015, EDF issued a senior “Formosa bond” on the
Taiwanese market for a total US$1,500 million, with 30-year maturity and
a 4.75% fixed coupon.

On 8 October 2015 EDF also issued a US$4,750 million senior bond in
five tranches:

m™ ~aUS$1,500 million bond with 5-year maturity and a 2.35% fixed coupon;

= a US$1,250 million green bond with 10-year maturity and a 3.625%
fixed coupon;

= ~aUS$500 million bond with 20-year maturity and a 4.75% fixed coupon;

m a US$1,150 million bond with 30-year maturity and a 4.95% fixed
coupon;

= ~aUS$350 million bond with 40-year maturity and a 5.25% fixed coupon,

The green bond issue of US$1.25 billion with 10-year maturity and a 3.625%
fixed coupon is enabling EDF to continue its investments for development
of renewable energies. This operation is based on the structure of EDF's
bond issue of November 2013 which is a benchmark for the market, and
demonstrates EDF’s ongoing commitment to development of the green
bond market and its support for best practices, in line with the Green
Bond Principles !:

m the funds raised by the green bond are exclusively dedicated to financing
renewable energy projects developed by EDF Energies Nouvelles;

m the projects funded are selected through a stringent, documented
process based on ESG criteria validated by the extra-financial rating
agency, Vigeo?;

m the funds raised are managed and monitored under strict segregation
principle, from their receipt in EDF's cash until allocation to eligible
green projects.

EDF will regularly report on the amounts allocated from the green bond, the
portfolio of projects financed and the associated environmental benefits.
A statement by Deloitte & Associés on respect of EDF’s commitments will
be included in the 2015 Reference Document.

These operations contribute to the Group’s investment strategy and are part
of its policy to extend the average maturity of its debt.

Details of the Group's bond borrowings are given in note 38.2 to the 2015
consolidated financial statements.

The average maturity of Group debt was 13 years at 31 December 2015,
compared to 13.2 years at 31 December 2014. For EDF SA, the average
maturity of debt was 13.9 years at 31 December 2015, against 14.4 years
at 31 December 2014.

1. The Green Bond Principles, updated in March 2015, are voluntary guidelines for issuance of green bonds. They recommend transparency and disclosure to support
development of the green bond market and promote integrity. For more information, see http://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/green-bonds/

green-bond-principles.

2. ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria cover five areas: respect for human rights and governance in the project's host country; management of environmental
impacts; protection of employee health and safety; promotion of responsible relationships with suppliers; and dialogue with local stakeholders.

The EDF group was able to meet its financing needs by conservative liquidity
management, and has obtained financing on satisfactory terms.

A range of specific levers are used to manage the Group's liquidity risk:

m the Group's cash pooling system, which centralises cash management
for controlled subsidiaries. The subsidiaries’ cash balances are made
available to EDF SA in return for interest, so as to optimise the Group’s
cash management and provide subsidiaries with a system that guarantees
them market-equivalent financial terms;

= centralisation of financing for controlled subsidiaries at the level of
the Group’s Cash Management Department. Changes in subsidiaries’
working capital are financed by this department in the form of stand-
by credit lines provided for subsidiaries, which may also be granted
revolving credit from the Group. EDF SA and the investment subsidiary
EDF Investissements Groupe (EDF IG), set up in partnership with the
bank Natixis Belgique Investissements, also provide medium and long-
term financing for EDF group operations outside France, arranged by
EDF SA and EDF IG on a totally independent basis: each company sets
its own terms, which are the same as the subsidiary would have in an
arm’s-length market transaction;

= active management and diversification of financing sources used by the
Group: the Group has access to short-term resources on various markets
through programmes for French commercial paper (billets de trésorerie),
US commercial paper and Euro market commercial paper. For EDF, the
ceilings for these programmes are €6 billion for its French commercial
paper, US$10 billion for its US commercial paper and €1.5 billion for its
Euro market commercial paper.

At 31 December 2015, the amount of commercial paper outstanding was
€3,744 million for French commercial paper, and US$3,232 million for US
commercial paper. No Euro market commercial paper has been issued.
EDF has access to the world’s main bond markets: the Euro markets through
its EMTN programme, which currently has a ceiling of €45 billion, particularly
for Euro and sterling issues; and the domestic markets used for stand-alone
issues in US dollars (144A bonds), yen (samurai bonds) and Swiss francs.

5.1.6.1.3. Management of foreign exchange risk

Due to the diversification of its activities and geographical locations, the
Group is exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which may have
an impact on the translation differences affecting balance sheet items, Group
financial expenses, equity and net income.

To limit exposure to foreign exchange risks, the Group has introduced the
following management principles:

® local currency financing: to the extent possible given the local financial
markets’ capacities, each entity finances its activities in its own accounting
currency. When financing is contracted in other currencies, derivatives
may be used to limit foreign exchange risk;

= matching of assets and liabilities: the net assets of subsidiaries located
outside the Euro zone expose the Group to a foreign exchange risk.
The foreign exchange risk in the consolidated balance sheet is managed
either by matching with liabilities for acquisitions in the same currency,
or by market hedging involving use of financial derivatives. Hedging of

GROSS DEBT STRUCTURE BY

net assets in foreign currencies complies with risk/return targets, and
the hedging ratio varies from 41% to 73% depending on the currency
(apart from the BRL and CNY). If no hedging instruments are available,
or if hedging costs are prohibitive, the foreign exchange positions remain
open and the risk on such positions is monitored by sensitivity calculations;

= hedging of operating cash flows in foreign currencies: in general, the
operating cash flows of EDF and its subsidiaries are in the relevant local
currencies, with the exception of flows related to fuel purchases which
are primarily in US dollars, and certain flows related to purchases of
equipment, which concern lower amounts. Under the principles of
the Strategic Financial Management Framework, EDF and the main
subsidiaries concerned by foreign exchange risks (EDF Energy, EDF Trading,
Edison, EDF Energies Nouvelles) are required to hedge firm or highly
probable commitments related to these future operating cash flows.

As a result of the financing and foreign exchange risk hedging policy,
the Group’s gross debt at 31 December 2015 breaks down as follows by
currency after hedging:

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

The foreign exchange risk on available-for-sale securities is mostly
concentrated in EDF's dedicated asset portfolio, which is discussed in
section 5.1.6.1.6 “Management of financial risk on EDF's dedicated asset
portfolio”.

The foreign exchange risk associated with short-term investments and
operating liabilities in foreign currencies remains restricted for the Group
at 31 December 2015.

5.1.6.1.4 Management of interest rate risk

The exposure of the Group’s net indebtedness to interest rate fluctuations
covers two types of risk: a risk of change in the net financial expenses on
floating-rate financial assets and liabilities, and a risk of change in the value of
financial assets invested at fixed rates. These risks are managed by monitoring

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

the floating-rate portion of net indebtedness, defined by reference to the
risk/return for net financial expenses, taking into consideration expected
movements in interest rates.

Some of the debt is variabilised and the Group may use interest rate
derivatives for hedging purposes. The distribution of exposure between
fixed and floating rates is monitored.

The Group’s debt after hedging instruments at 31 December 2015 comprised
54.09% at fixed rates and 45.91% at floating rates.

A 1% uniform annual rise in interest rates would generate an approximate
€296 million increase in financial expenses at 31 December 2015, based
on gross floating-rate debt after hedging.

The average cost of Group debt (weighted interest rate on outstanding
amounts) was 2.92% at the end of 2015.

The table below sets forth the structure of Group debt and the impact of a 1% variation in interest rates at 31 December 2015. The impact of the change

in interest rates was €73 million higher than in 2014.

5.1.6.1.5 Management of equity risks

The equity risk is concentrated in the following areas:

Coverage of EDF's nuclear obligations

Analysis of the equity risk is presented in section 5.1.6.1.6 “Management
of financial risk on EDF's dedicated asset portfolio”.

Coverage of employee benefit obligations for EDF SA,
EDF Energy and British Energy

Assets covering EDF's employee benefit liabilities are partly invested on the
international and European equities markets. Market trends therefore affect
the value of these assets, and a downturn in equity prices would lead to a
rise in balance sheet provisions.

29.5% of the assets covering EDF's employee benefit obligations were
invested in equities at 31 December 2015, representing an amount of
€3.1 billion of equities.

At 31 December 2015, the two pension funds sponsored by EDF Energy
(EDF Energy Pension Scheme and EDF Energy Group Electricity Supply Pension
Scheme) were invested to the extent of 36.2% in equities and equity funds,
representing an amount of £438 million of equities.

CENG fund

CENG is exposed to equity risks in the management of its funds established
to cover nuclear decommissioning and employee benefit obligations.

EDF's long-term cash management

As part of its long-term cash management policy, EDF has continued its
strategy to reduce the portion of equity-correlated investments, resulting
in a non-significant position well below €1 million at 31 December 2015.

Direct investment

At 31 December 2015, EDF's investment in AREVA amounted to €46.5 million,
with estimated volatility of 36.0% (annualised volatility of monthly returns
observed over three years).

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

5.1.6.1.6 Management of financial risk on EDF's
dedicated asset portfolio

Dedicated assets have been built up progressively by EDF since 1999
to secure financing of its long-term nuclear commitments. The Law
of 28 June 2006 and its implementing regulations defined provisions not
related to the operating cycle, which must therefore be covered by dedicated
assets; they are listed in note 47 to the consolidated financial statements
at 31 December 2015, “Dedicated assets”.

The dedicated asset portfolio is managed under the supervision of the Board
of Directors and its advisory committees (Nuclear Commitments Monitoring
Committee, Audit Committee).

The Nuclear Commitments Monitoring Committee (CSEN) is a specialised
Committee set up by EDF's Board of Directors in 2007.

A Nuclear Commitments Financial Expertise Committee (CEFEN) exists
to assist the Company and its governance bodies on questions of matching
assets and liabilities and asset management. The members of this Committee
are independent of EDF. They are selected for their skills and diversity of
experience, particularly in the fields of asset/liability management, economic
and financial research, and asset management.

Governance and management principles

The governance principles setting forth the structure, decision-making and
control processes for the management of dedicated assets are validated
by EDF's Board of Directors. These principles also lay down rules for the
asset portfolio’s structure, selection of financial managers, and the legal,
accounting and tax structure of the funds.

Strategic asset allocation is based on asset/liability reviews carried out to
define the most appropriate target portfolio for financing long-term nuclear
expenses. Strategic allocation is validated by EDF's Board of Directors
and reviewed every three years unless circumstances require otherwise.
Since 2013, this target allocation has consisted of a financial portfolio and
around one quarter of unlisted assets. The unlisted assets are managed by
EDF Invest (formed in July 2013 following the Decree of 24 July 2013) and
comprise infrastructures, real estate and investment funds.

The financial portfolio principally contains two sub-portfolios, “equities” and
“bonds”, themselves divided into “secondary asset classes” or “pockets”
that correspond to specific markets. The strategic allocation of the financial
portfolio is 49% international equities and 51% bonds. A benchmark index
is set for monitoring performance and controlling the risk on the financial
portfolio: MSCI World AC DN hedged in Euros 50% (excluding emerging
country currencies) for the equities sub-portfolio, and a composite index of
60% Citigroup EGBI and 40% Citigroup EuroBlG corporate for the bonds
sub-portfolio.

A third “cash” sub-portfolio exists to provide secure coverage for the
disbursements related to the purpose of the asset covered, and may be
reinforced tactically, particularly when a prudent approach is required in
the event of a market crisis.

The CSPE receivable was allocated to dedicated assets on 13 February 2013.
Tactical management of the financial portfolio has several focal areas:

= monitoring of exposure between the “equities” and “bonds”
sub-portfolios;

= within each sub-portfolio, allocation by “secondary asset class”;

® selection of investment funds, aiming for diversification:

by style (growth securities, unlisted securities, high-return securities),

by capitalisation (major stocks, medium and small stocks),

by investment process (macroeconomic and sector-based approach,
selection of securities on a “quantitative” basis, etc.),

by investment vehicle (for compliance with maximum investment
ratios);

= for bonds, a choice of securities held directly, through brokers, or via
investment funds incorporating the concern for diversification:

= by type of issue (fixed income, indexed income),

= by type of instrument (government or supranational bonds, covered
bonds and similar, corporate bonds),

= by issuer and by maturity.

The allocation policy for the financial portfolio was developed by the
Operational Management Committee ' on the basis of the economic and
financial outlook for each market and geographical area, a review of market
appreciation in different markets and market segments, and risk analyses
produced by the CRFI department.

Change in regulations

The Decree of 24 March 2015 contains two new measures concerning
dedicated assets:

m the annual allocation to dedicated assets, net of any increases to
provisions, must be positive or zero as long as their realisable value is
below 110% of the amount of the provisions concerned;

® subject to certain conditions, real estate property owned by the operators.
of nuclear facilities may be allocated to coverage of these provisions.

Changes in the portfolio during 2015

In 2015 EDF Invest and two other long-term investors completed acquisition
of a minority shareholding in Madrilefia Red de Gas (MRG), a regulated
operator for the Madrid region gas distribution network.

Also, EDF Invest and Ardian, through a consortium held in equal shares,
acquired an investment of more than 50% in Géosel, a hydrocarbon storage
company based in Manosque in France, from the Total group.

Both these investments (see sections 5.1.3.4.1.4 “EDF Invest finalises the
acquisition of Madrilefia Red de Gas” and 5.1.3.4.1.5 “Ardian and EDF Invest
sign a firm agreement for acquisition of a majority stake in Géosel from
Total”) were allocated to EDF Invest’s “Infrastructures” pocket along with
RTE, TIGF and Porterbrook.

Over the year EDF Invest also continued to build up its real estate and
investment fund portfolio.

The non-exclusive real estate investment fund created in late 2014 at the
initiative of EDF Invest and Amundi undertook a second real estate investment
in Germany during 2015.

EDF Invest also signed a contract with Nexity in September 2015 for the
off-plan purchase of the Smart Side office and service “campus”. This
development will be located on the edge of Paris in the towns of Saint-Ouen
and Clichy, and its address will be in Paris’ 17" arrondissement.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

Changes in the financial portfolio are described in the following section,
under the heading “Performance of EDF's dedicated asset portfolio”.

The CSPE receivable is a financial receivable (bearing interest at 1.72%). It will
be repaid under a revised schedule extending to the end of 2020, which is to
be set out in a decision as stated in a ministerial letter of 26 January 2016.
In that letter the State also acknowledged the shortfall that arose
between 2013 and 2015, estimated at €644 million and included in the
revised repayment schedule, and authorised its allocation to dedicated assets.

The allocation to dedicated assets for 2015 was €38 million, resulting from
allocation during the second half-year of shares already owned by EDF SA

(no allocations were made to dedicated assets in 2014). As increases to
provisions that must be offset by allocations to dedicated assets under the
Decree of 24 March 2015 amount to €1,010 million over the year 2015,
the allocations to dedicated assets yet to be made amount to €972 million
at 31 December 2015. These allocations must be made within a maximum
of three years from that date.

Disbursements relating to decommissioning expenses incurred in 2015

portfolio.

(2) Performance for assets held at the start of the year. The RTE shares are included at their equity value in the consolidated financial statements (to the extent of their allocation
to the dedicated asset portfolio), i.e. they are not adjusted to fair value. By limiting the value of certain investments in compliance with Article 16 of Decree 2007-243
concerning calculation of the regulatory realisable value of dedicated assets which must be equal to or greater than long-term nuclear provisions, the amount of this
regulatory realisable value has been reduced to €3,887 million for EDF Invest assets and a total €23,392 million for all dedicated assets.

There were three major events in 2015: the continued decline in oil prices,
which accelerated towards the end of the year, the growth dichotomy
between developed countries and emerging countries, and the divergent
developments in the principal countries’ monetary policies.

After recovering by almost 30% in the first half-year, oil resumed its dramatic
fall and the price per barrel was halved. This had major impacts for emerging
countries that produce commodities, while the positive impact on consumers
remained more diffuse. This “black gold” price pattern certainly contributed
to the economic divergence between developed countries, although growth
figures were satisfactory, including in Europe and emerging countries. The
situation was particularly worrying in Brazil and Russia, but the slowdown
in China and the decision by the People’s Bank of China to widen the yuan-
dollar rate band were the main causes of the summer's emphatic stock
market correction. The ongoing fall in oil prices and anxieties over Chinese
policy affected the markets again at the end of the year. The first increase
for more than 10 years in Federal Reserve rates also added to the climate of
feverish uncertainty, and investors did not consider further monetary policy
relaxation by the ECB sufficient to make up for these points of concern.
The geopolitical environment was another source of volatility, with terrorist
attacks in France, poorly coordinated international intervention in the Middle
East, rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and more.

In the Euro zone, tensions appear to have faded after an acute crisis phase
in Greece during the summer. Action by the ECB, especially its Quantitative
Easing policy, helped considerably to stabilise peripheral spreads at low
levels, although the fragile political situation in the Iberian peninsula is still
being closely watched by the market.

These events led to a deliberate but moderate devaluation of the Euro
against the dollar.

Against this background, after a relatively volatile year, stock markets rose
over the year. The world equities markets (MSCI World AC DN index hedged
in Euros 50%, excluding emerging country currencies) were up by 4.9%.
The European bond index (60% Citigroup EGBI and 40% Citigroup EuroBIG
corporate) progressed by 0.8%. This is close to the coupon on bonds, as
rates ultimately moved little overall. After a marked decrease early in the

298

EDF | 2015 Reference Document

year and a strong rebound in the second quarter, rates stabilised during the
second part of the year at close to their initial level.

In this market environment, the financial portfolio performance was positive
at +3.5%. This should be compared with the composite benchmark, which
rose by +3.0%. Given the lack of visibility from the summer onwards, the
bond/equities allocation was kept close to neutral in the second part of the
year. However, geographical allocations that prioritised Europe and Japan
over North America and emerging countries in particular were continued. The
+50 bp difference is principally explained by the good active management
performance in Europe and North America, and foreign exchange exposures:
overweighting in the Swiss franc and pound sterling at the beginning of the
year, and in the Yen at the end of the year. In bonds, sensitivity management
and credit management brought profitable results.

In 2015, the overall after-tax performance of dedicated assets (impacts
on reserves and net income) was +€516 million: +€309 million on the
financial portfolio and cash (+506 million before tax), +€53 million for the
CSPE receivable after funding (+€86 million before tax) and +€153 million
for EDF Invest (including +€113 million for the RTE shares allocated to
dedicated assets).

Dedicated assets’ exposure to risks

EDF is exposed to equity risks, interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks
through its dedicated asset portfolio.

The market value of the equities sub-portfolio in EDF's dedicated asset
portfolio was €7,304 million at 31 December 2015. The volatility of
the equities sub-portfolio can be estimated through the volatility of
its benchmark index, which at 31 December 2015 was 15.5% based
on 52 weekly performances, compared to 12.4% at 31 December 2014.
Applying this volatility to the value of equity assets at the same date, the
Group estimates the annual volatility of the equities portion of dedicated
assets at €1,132 million. This volatility is likely to affect the Group’s equity.

At 31 December 2015, the sensitivity of the bond sub-portfolio
(€6,694 million) was 5.52, i.e. a uniform 100 base point rise in interest
rates would result in a €369 million decline in market value which would


--- Page 38 ---

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

be recorded in consolidated equity. The sensitivity was 5.38 at the end
of 2014. While the sensitivity of the bond sub-portfolio was higher than
in 2014, it remained below the sensitivity of the benchmark index (6.19).

5.1.6.1.7 Management of counterparty/credit risks

Counterparty risk is defined as the total loss that the EDF group would
sustain on its business and market transactions if a counterparty defaulted
and failed to perform its contractual obligations.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

The Group has a counterparty risk management policy which applies to
the parent company and all operationally controlled subsidiaries. This
policy, updated in September 2014, sets out the governance associated
with monitoring for this type of risk, and organisation of the counterparty
risk management and monitoring (including definition of limits and Group
indicators). The policy also involves monthly consolidation of the Group’s
exposures, updated monthly for financial and energy market activities and
quarterly for other activities. The CRFl Department closely monitors Group.
counterparties (daily review of alerts, special cautionary measures for certain
counterparties).

The table below gives details, by rating, of the EDF group’s consolidated exposure to counterparty risk. At 30 September 2015, 86% of the Group's exposure
concerns “investment grade” counterparties, mainly as a result of the predominance of exposures generated by the cash and asset management activity,

with most short-term investments in low-risk assets:

AAA AA A BBB BB B cccic Unrated Total
31/03/2015 2% 20% A% 22% 4% 1% 0% 10% 100%
30/09/2015 2% 19% 37% 21% 11% 1% 0% 9% 100%

The exposure to counterparty risk by nature of activity is distributed as follows:

Distribution Cash and asset _—_ Fuel purchases and
Purchases Insurance and sales management energy trading Total
31/03/2015 6% 1% 8% 74% 11% 100%
30/09/2015 11% 1% 8% 70% 10% 100%

Exposure in the energy trading activities is concentrated at the level of
EDF Trading, where each counterparty is assigned a limit that depends on
its financial robustness. A range of methods are used to reduce counterparty
risk at EDF Trading, primarily position netting agreements, cash-collateral
agreements and establishment of guarantees from banks or affiliates.

For counterparties dealing with EDF's trading room, the CRFI Department
has drawn up a framework specifying counterparty authorisation procedures
and the methodology for calculation of allocated limits. The level of exposure
can be consulted in real time and is systematically monitored on a daily basis.
The suitability of limits is reviewed without delay in the event of an alert or
unfavourable development affecting a counterparty.

As the situation in the Euro zone is still unstable, EDF has continued to
apply a prudent management policy for its cash investments in non-core
countries. Apart from dedicated assets, purchases of sovereign debt
are restricted to maximum maturities of three years for Italy and Spain
(no exposure in Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, etc). Only “investment grade”
banking counterparties are authorised, for limited amounts and maturities.

5.1.6.2 Management and control of energy
market risks

5.1.6.2.1 Framework for management and control
of energy market risks

In keeping with the opening of the final customer market, development
of the wholesale markets and on the international scene, the EDF group is
exposed to price variations on the energy market which can significantly
affect its financial statements.

Consequently, the Group has an “energy markets” risk policy for all energy
commodities, applicable to EDF and entities over which it has operational
control.

The purpose of this policy is to:

= define the general framework for management of energy market risks,
governing the various Group entities’ asset portfolio management
activities (energy generation, optimisation and sale), and trading for
EDF Trading;

= define the responsibilities of asset managers and traders, and the various
levels of control of activities;

= implement a coordinated Group-wide hedging policy that is coherent
with the Group’s financial commitments;

=™ consolidate the exposure of the various entities operationally controlled
by EDF on the structured energy-related markets.

At Dalkia, EDF Energies Nouvelles and Edison, the principles of the energy
market risk policy continue to be rolled out. These entities are managed
under a risk management framework approved by the Group's Executive
Committee (Comex) and their respective Boards of Directors.

At entities not operationally controlled by EDF, the risk management
framework is reviewed by the governance bodies.

5.1.6.2.2 Organisation of risk control

The process for controlling energy market risks for entities operationally
controlled by the Group is based on:

™ a governance and market risk exposure measurement system, clearly
separating management and risk control responsibilities;

299

EDF | 2015 Reference Document


--- Page 39 ---

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

™ an express delegation to each entity, defining hedging strategies and
establishing the associated risk limits. This enables the Comex to set out
and monitor an annual Group risk profile consistent with the financial
objectives, and thus direct operational management of energy market
risks over market horizons (generally 3 years).

Given its close interaction with the decisions made in the generation, supply
and trading activities, this process involves Group management and is
based on a risk indicator and measurement system incorporating escalation
procedures in the event risk limits are exceeded.

The Group’s exposure to energy market risks through operationally controlled
entities is reported to the Comex on a quarterly basis. The control processes
are regularly evaluated and audited.

5.1.6.2.3 Principles for operational management
and control of energy market risks

The principles for operational management and control of energy
market risks for the Group's operationally controlled entities are based
on clearly-defined responsibilities for managing those risks, distinguishing
between management of assets (generation and supply) and trading.

Managers of generation and supply assets are responsible for implementing
arisk management strategy that minimises the impact of energy market risks
on the variability of their financial statements (the accounting classifications
of these hedges are described in note 41 to the 2015 consolidated financial
statements). However, a residual risk remains that cannot be hedged on
the market due to factors such as insufficient liquidity or market depth,
uncertainty over volumes, etc.

For operationally controlled entities in the Group, positions on the energy
markets are taken predominantly by EDF Trading, the Group’s trading entity,
which operates on the markets on behalf of other Group entities and for the
purposes of its own trading activity associated with the Group’s industrial
assets. Consequently, EDF Trading is subject to a strict governance and control
framework, particularly the European regulations on trading companies.

EDF Trading trades on organised or OTC markets in derivatives such
as futures, forwards, swaps and options (regardless of the accounting
classification applied at Group level). Its exposure on the energy markets is
strictly controlled through daily limit monitoring overseen by the subsidiary’s
management and by the division in charge of energy market risk control at
Group level. Automatic escalation procedures also exist to inform members
of EDF Trading’s Board of Directors of any breach of risk limits (value at risk
limit) or loss limits (stop-loss limits). Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure
of the potential maximum loss in market value on a portfolio in the event
of unfavourable market movements, over a given time horizon and with a
given confidence interval '. The stop-loss limit stipulates the acceptable risk
for the trading business by setting a maximum level of loss over a rolling
three-month period. If the limit is exceeded, EDF Trading’s Board of Directors
takes appropriate action, which may include closing certain positions

In 2015, EDF Trading’s commitment on the markets was subject to a daily
VaR limit of €36 million (with a daily confidence interval of 97.5%), and
a stop-loss limit of €180 million?. The VaR and stop-loss limits were not
exceeded in 2015, and EDF Trading’s risks remained within the limits of
the mandate from EDF at all times. The stop-loss has never been triggered
since its introduction.

At Edison, for operational purposes net exposure? is calculated based on
the entire portfolio of assets and contracts (industrial portfolio), and on
assets and contracts related to its trading business for the company’s own.
purposes (trading portfolio). The level of economic capital engaged in the
markets, expressed in terms of Profit at Risk (PaR*) is then determined using
this net exposure.

For an analysis of fair value hedges of the Group's commodities, see note 41.5
to the 2015 consolidated financial statements. For details of commodity
derivatives not classified as hedges by the Group, see note 42.3 to the same
consolidated financial statements.

5.1.6.3 Management of insurable risks

The EDF group has an extensive insurance programme that covers EDF SA and
its controlled subsidiaries as they are integrated. The coverage, exclusions,
excesses and limits are appropriate to each business and the specificities
of these subsidiaries.

The main insurance programmes cover:

= conventional damage to Group property: EDF is a member of the
international mutual insurance company for energy operators, OIL.
Additional insurance coverage is provided by EDF's captive insurance
subsidiary Wagram Insurance Company Ltd®., other insurers and
reinsurers;

= damage to the EDF group's nuclear facilities: In addition to coverage
through EDF's membership of OIL, physical damage (including following a
nuclear accident) to EDF's nuclear installations in France and EDF Energy's
nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom, and nuclear decontamination
costs, are covered by a Group insurance policy involving the French
nuclear pool (Assuratome), the British atomic pool National Risk Insurers
(NRI), European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance (EMANI), and
the insurer Northcourt.

In connection with CENG’s operations in the United States, EDF Inc. is
a member of NEIL7;

= damage to merchandise transported;

= nuclear operator's civil liability: EDF's current insurance policies
comply with French law no. 68-943 of 31 October 1968, as amended
by Law no. 90-488 of 16 June 1990, which codified the civil liability
obligations imposed on nuclear facility operators by the Paris Convention.
To guarantee availability of the funds required to meet such obligations,
EDF opted to use insurance policies with the insurance company AGCS

1. EDF Trading estimates the VaR by the “Monte Carlo” method, which is based on volatilities and historical correlations measured using observed market prices over the

40 most recent business days. The VaR limit applies to the total EDF Trading portfolio.
2. Five times the VaR: €180 million.

time horizon and confidence interval.
5. Oil Insurance Limited.
6. An Irish insurance company fully-owned by EDF
7. Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited.

(formerly called Allianz) and the mutual insurance company European
Liability Insurance for the Nuclear Industry (ELINI).

For onsite accidents, total cover is €91.5 million per nuclear accident,
for a maximum of two occasions per site within a three-year period.
In accordance with the law, these insurance policies do not include
an excess. However, Océane Re, a Group reinsurance company, shares
this risk through reinsurance agreements entered into with the insurers
stated above.

The €91.5 million cover will be raised to €700 million from 18 February 2016
in line with the law of 17 August 2015 on the energy transition for
green growth, which raises the ceilings for indemnities in the event
of a nuclear accident (to €700 million for installations, €70 million for
lower-risk installations and €80 million for transport), without extending
the scope of liability.

Consequently, EDF put out a call for tenders in August 2015 to set up
the appropriate coverage and related claim management.

In the United Kingdom, where EDF Energy operates nuclear plants, the
liability scheme applicable to operators of nuclear facilities is similar to
that in France. EDF Energy is insured to the extent of £140 million, the
current limit for civil liability applicable to nuclear plant operators in the
United Kingdom. Since 1 January 2014, this insurance has been provided
by the European mutual insurance company ELINI and Wagram Insurance
Company Ltd. Océane Re is associated with this risk through the
reinsurance contract issued to the benefit of Wagram Insurance
Company Ltd.

In the United States, the specific Price-Anderson Act regime would apply
in the event of a significant nuclear accident (above US$300 million);

= general civil liability: this programme covers the Group against the
possible financial consequences for third parties of the (non-nuclear)
risks inherent to the EDF group’s businesses;

= civil liability of directors and senior executives: EDF's insurance
programme covers defence costs and other financial consequences arising
from third party claims against the Group's managers and key executives,
either individually or jointly, for any proven or alleged misconduct in the
course of their duties;

= construction risks: for these risks, EDF takes out insurance policies
covering specific worksite risks (general worksite risks/general assembly

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

risks). These policies are not part of a Group programme but are purchased
on an ad hoc basis for major projects such as the Flamanville EPR,
or construction of combined cycle power plants, dams, combustion
turbines, etc. This cover is recorded as an investment in the EDF SA
financial statements;

= exploration and production: Edison had a specific insurance policy
providing damage and civil liability coverage worth €2.2 billion for
these assets, both onshore and offshore. Through optimised use of
EDF’s membership of OIL, Edison was able to construct a new specific
“Exploration and Production” programme from 1 January 2013;

m= ERDF’s overhead distribution network: on 11 August 2011, ERDF
took out a policy with Natixis/Swiss Re that runs until 5 May 2016 for
coverage of its overhead distribution network against the consequences
of exceptional events such as storms and gales. This “cat-bond”
provided maximum cover of €150 million, with payouts based on a
parametric index dependent on wind speed. It was redeemed early on
15 September 2015 in accordance with the conditions for ERDF trigger
levels, as stipulated in the issuance contract for Pylon Il Capital Ltd
Catastrophe Bonds.

ERDF therefore put out a European call for tenders to select an
arrangement, structuring and placement company to set up new cover
for storm risks, through parametric insurance running for five winters.

In the meantime, on 25 September 2015 ERDF signed a “bridge policy”
equivalent to Pylon II for the period 25 September 2015 to 30 April 2016,
so that the network is insured against high-intensity gales and storms.
during that time.

The underlying Pylon Il cover with €40 million capacity, which was
signed on 16 November 2011, terminated on 27 December 2015.
Until its storm cover is renewed, ERDF signed a “bridge cover” contract
on 14 December 2015, providing equivalent coverage to the Pylon II
underlying for the period 28 December 2015 to 30 April 2016. This
reinforces the network insurance for storm and gale risks during that
period.

The total value of premiums for all types of coverage provided by
EDF's insurance programmes and Group programmes managed by
EDF Assurances was €154.3 million in 2015, excluding insurance covering
people, and €17.5 million for coverage of ERDF's overhead networks.

5.1.7 INFORMATION UNDER ARTICLE L. 441-6-1 OF THE FRENCH COMMERCIAL CODE

Since 1 December 2008, EDF has applied the law no. 2008-776 of 4 August 2008 (the French law on modernisation of the economy) and settles supplier

invoices within 60 days of the invoice date.

EDF SA’‘s trade payables excluding invoices receivable amounted to €2,560 million at 31 December 2015 and to €2,540 million at 31 December 2014,

distributed as follows:

31 December 2015 31 December 2014

Subsequent events

This chapter presents the material events which occurred between
15 February 2016, when the Board of Directors closed the financial
statements, and the date of filing of this Reference Document (see note 50
of the Appendix to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year
ended 31 December 2015).

FLAMANVILLE EPR: 15° MILESTONE ACHIEVED
WITH FINALISATION OF THE PRIMARY CIRCUIT
MECHANICAL ERECTION

On 24 March 2016, the EDF group announced that the mechanical erection
of the Flamanville EPR’s main primary circuit ' had been completed, as the
large components had been installed and assembled (four steam generators,
reactor vessel, pressuriser and reactor coolant pumps).

This stage marks the achievement of the first key milestone set by the EDF
Group for the first quarter of 2016, in compliance with the schedule updated
overt the summer of 2015.

Quality inspections performed demonstrated that all assembly operations
fulfil the expected requirements. Only one weld out of the 32 performed
on the primary circuit has to be reworked to ensure compliance.

After completion of the main building structure at the end of 2015 and
finalisation of the primary circuit mechanical erection, construction of the
Flamanville EPR continues to advance at a sustained pace towards the
2" milestone as electromechanical erection accelerates and plant system
test phases start (system by system). These operations will intensify in the
second half of the year, in coordination with the suppliers and the teams
in charge of reactor operation in order to prepare for system performance
testing planned for 2017.

HANDLING ACCIDENT AT PALUEL
POWER PLANT

Thursday 31 March 2016, a handling accident occurred in the reactor building
of Unit 2, shut down since May 2015 with its tank completely defueled.

During a handling operation on a used steam generator, carried out as part
of its replacement, it has switched to its height to be grounded.

The first elements of controls, carried out by a technical team of EDF,
establish that the steam generator is partly positioned on the concrete of
the reactor building, and partly on the protection plates of the pool of the
reactor building, some of which have been damaged.

The event had no impact on the health of participants, nor on plant safety
or the environment.

The ASN was informed of the event and visited the site. The expertise
needed to understand the causes of the event are ongoing and an inspection
program was engaged to assess the work to lead and define the terms of
resumption of handling operations on the steam generator.

The reactor should remain stopped several months.

FLAMANVILLE EPR: ADVANCEMENT
OF REACTOR VESSEL TESTING PROGRAMME

On 13 April 2016, AREVA, together with EDF, has recommended to the
French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) to adapt the testing programme of
the Flamanville 3 EPR reactor vessel head and bottom, as decided at the
end of 2015.

Initial analyses conducted on two parts similar to those at Flamanville 3
have shown that the carbon segregation phenomena extend beyond
mid-thickness on one of them.

As specified in the initial strategy approved by the ASN, the material sampling
and related tests will be extended to three-fourths of the thickness of the
part concerned.

The purpose of these initial analyses is also to better specify the variability
of the main manufacturing parameters of the different parts. AREVA and
EDF have therefore proposed extending the testing programme to include
a third part to strengthen the robustness of the demonstration.

These adaptations to the testing programme will double the number of
samples analysed. A total number of 1200 material samples will be taken
‘to consolidate the representative nature of the three forged parts tested,
both for carbon content and required mechanical properties.

The ASN has approved this addition to the testing programme, which will
continue through the end of 2016, when the final report will be submitted.

EDF and AREVA have reaffirmed their confidence in their ability to
demonstrate the quality and safety of the reactor vessel for the start-up of
‘the Flamanville 3 reactor planned for the last quarter of 2018. The assembly
and testing activities are going ahead at the construction site in line with
the announced schedule.

EDF, THE CEA AND AREVA ESTABLISH
THE FRENCH NUCLEAR PLATFORM

On 31 March 2016, in order to develop aligned positions to meet the major
challenges facing the French nuclear sector and to prepare the appropriate
decisions, EDF, the CEA and AREVA have decided to found the French Nuclear
Platform (Plateforme France Nucléaire — PFN), a tripartite body to discuss
the major transversal topics for the nuclear sector in France and abroad.

This body will unite, on a quarterly basis, six key managers from the three
entities, including the Chairmen of the CEA, EDF and AREVA. Its chairmanship
will be decided on a rotating basis, with the Chairman’s mandate lasting
one year. The first mandate will be entrusted to the Chairman of AREVA.

The purpose of the PFN is to improve the joint effectiveness of the three
entities, in particular to devise a shared vision of the medium- and long-
term goals for the sector, which will contribute to the preparation and
implementation of decisions taken by the French Presidential Nuclear Policy
Council (Conseil de Politique Nucléaire).

The PFN will establish by the end of 2016 a working agenda that will to
cover the current priority topics: the prospects for the French nuclear sector
in accordance with France's Energy Transition law, the sector's international
strategy established in cooperation with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs

1. The primary circuit is a closed loop circuit, containing pressurised water. This water is heated in the reactor vessel when in contact with the fuel assemblies. The acquired
heat is transferred to the secondary coolant in the steam generators to produce steam to drive the turbine generator.

and International Development and other concerned ministries, the review
of technological options for the EPR NM, the consolidation of relations
with SMEs in the sector in coordination with the French Industry Strategic
Committee (Comité Stratégique de Filiére Nucléaire), and the coordination
of positions on regulatory changes notably regarding safety requirements
and objectives. The PFN will also work together on the future of the closed
fuel cycle in France and abroad, the optimization of the CIGEO deep waste
disposal project, the development of dismantling technologies, as well as
the R&D program for fourth generation reactors.

It was imperative for EDF, the CEA and AREVA to form a consultative body
to be able to best confront the profound changes currently underway in
the highly-competitive nuclear.

EDF AND STUDSVIK SIGN AN AGREEMENT
IN DECOMMISSIONING AND RADIOACTIVE
WASTE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

EDF and Sweden-based Studsvik signed on 20 April 2016 an agreement
regarding decommissioning and radioactive waste management activities.
EDF thus completes its low-level radioactive waste treatment activities by
reinforcing the existing capacity of its French subsidiary Socodei.

According to this agreement, EDF Development Environnement SA, a
100% subsidiary of EDF SA, will acquire Studsvik’s Waste Treatment
business and facilities in Sweden and the UK. The scope of the transaction
includes Studsvik’s waste treatment assets and facilities for metal recycling,
incineration and pyrolysis ' situated at the Studsvik site, near Nykoping in
Sweden, as well as the Metal Recycling Facility (MRF) near Workington in
the UK.

As part of the transaction, EDF and Studsvik have also signed a cooperation
agreement in the areas of nuclear decommissioning and waste management.
This agreement will enable both companies to pool their expertise and to
grow their activity in order to become benchmark operators in the sector.

The acquisition of Studvisk’s waste treatment activity will significantly
increase EDF's industrial capacity and represents a major milestone for
EDF's development in waste management and decommissioning activities.

EDF is expected to take over the operations on completion of the transaction
when all necessary licenses and permits have been granted by the relevant
authorities in relation to the Waste Treatment business to be acquired.
Closing is expected during the third quarter of 2016.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ MEETING HELD
ON 22 APRIL 2016

During its meeting held on 22 April 2016, EDF's Board of Directors reviewed
the Group's long term financial trajectory under the new adverse market
price conditions.

A responsible, efficient electricity producer that champions low carbon
growth, EDF group’ ambitions are consistent with its CAP 2030 strategy
priorities:

= proximity to customers and local communities;

= low carbon generation, with a balanced mix of nuclear and renewable
energy;

® international expansion.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

An action plan was presented to the Board of Directors which includes:

= net investments (excluding Linky and excluding new developments)
optimised by close to €2 billion in 2018 compared to 2015. Net
investments should reach €10.5 billion in 2018;

™ a reduction in operational expenditures of at least €1 billion in 2019
compared to 2015;

™ anassets disposals plan of c. €10 billion by the 2020 horizon.

These measures will be included in the Group’s Medium Term Plan to be
presented to the Board of Directors in December as every year.

The Board of Directors examined the need to increase the company’s equity
capital:

= EDF shared its intention to propose an option to pay the dividend related
‘to fiscal years 2016 and 2017 in shares and to submit to the Board
of Directors, by the closure date of the 2016 accounts and subject to
market conditions, a capital increase project via a market operation for
an amount of around €4 billion;

m the French State informed the Board of its position on the matter: it is
disclosed separately.

Wholesale power prices — ranging between 25 and 28 €/MWh since the
beginning of 2016 ~ are at an all-time low. Prices could stay at this low level
in France and in Europe over the next two to three years. In France, the end
of regulated tariffs for businesses at end 2015 increases EDF's exposure to.
wholesale market prices. Around 65% of EDF's generation output in France
is now exposed to market prices.

EDF announces consequently an action plan? in order to enable the
company, despite these adverse market conditions, to continue its strategic
development within the CAP 2030 framework.

1. Investments optimisation and selectivity in accordance with the
CAP 2030 strategy

Investments on the existing scope will be reduced by close to €2 billion
between 2015 and 2018, with the objective to reach €10.5 billion by then.

Investments excluding existing scope representing close to €2 billion per year
are planned until 2018 in regulated activities (Linky meters whose rollout is
already under way, construction of new generation units from renewable
energy sources, Hinkly Point C project).

The total amount of Group investments should hence range between
€12.5 billion and €13.5 billion per year over the next three years.

2. Reduction in operational expenditures

The Group already reduced cost by around €300 million in 2015 compared
to 2014 and announced, during the presentation of its annual results on
16 February 2016, a cost reduction objective of €700 million in 2018
compared to 2015.

Cost reductions are strengthened and furthered. The reduction objective is
reinforced to at least €1 billion in 2019 compared to 2015.

3. Assets disposals plan to finance the Group’s new developments

The disposals plan initiated in 2015 to contribute to financing investments
corresponding to new developments is strengthened. The Group sets an
assets disposals target of around €10 billion between 2015 and the 2020
horizon, including an evolution of RTE’s equity capital, thermal power
generation assets outside of France and minorities stakes.

1. Pyrolisis is a thermochemical decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures.
2. These figures do not include the projected acquisition of a controlling stake in AREVA NP.

THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN 2015 AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK
CHANGES IN MARKET PRICES FROM JANUARY TO MARCH 2016

(53

Changes in market prices from January to March 2016

In France, the electricity prices of the day for the day after (spot) amounted on
the first quarter 2016 to € 28.8/MWh on average and on basis (- €16.1/MWh
compared to the first quarter 2015), to €25.2/MWh in Germany (- €6.9/MWh)
and € 45.1/MWh in England (- €9.8/MWh). This difference can be explained
by the more relaxed climatic conditions compared to last year and by the
decrease of commodity prices which resulted in a sharp decrease of the
operating cost of thermal power plants in all countries.

The price of the Brent barrel reached $27.9/bbl on 20 January 2016, its
lowest level in 12 years. It then climbed gradually to close the quarter at
$39.6/bbl. Over the quarter, it sharply decreased compared to the first
quarter of 2015 (an average of $35.2/bbl, a drop of $19.9/bbl).

The (spot) gas prices in the French market for PEG Nord were at €13.1/MWh
on average over the first quarter 2016, a drop of €8.7/MWh in comparison
with the same period last year. This drop is due to the drop in the price of oil,
through the indexing of gas supply contracts, and to the significant increase
of supply volumes by pipeline from Russia to Western Europe. Lastly, the
relatively gentle weather conditions did not contribute to supporting the
temperature-sensitive portion of natural gas demand (heating).

The prices of CO, are lower in comparison to last year (€5.6/t against
€7.2/t for the same time period). This drop can be explained by a decrease

in the demand for quotas, because of the subdued industrial perspectives
and because of projected operation being reviewed downwards, even to
the extent of closing of several carbon-fired power plants, mainly in the
United Kingdom.

The (spot) coal prices are on average at $45.3/t, a drop of 25% in comparison
to the price (spot) of the first quarter 2015. Supply is still abundant, in the
face of depressed demand, in Asia in particular. Russian coal exports also
increased, the production of coal having become very competitive in that
country, owing to the depreciation of the ruble in relation to the dollar. That
is also the case in Colombia and in South Africa. The drop in the price of
oil also brought about a drop in production costs, which was particularly
marked in the open-pit mines. However, some mines begin to close because
they are not profitable at this price level.

The forward electricity baseload price in France for delivery the following
year reached €27.5/MWh on average on the quarter, in comparison to
€38.9/ MWh in the first quarter 2015. This strong drop is linked in particular
to the drop in the price of fuels, gas, coal, as well as the drop in the price
of CO,.

Forward prices in neighboring countries also dropped, especially in England
and in Germany.

Outlook

(5.4

2016 TARGETS

On 16 February 2016, the Group announced the following financial
objectives for 2016:

= Group EBITDA: €16.3 to 16.8 billion;
= Net financial debt/EBITDA: between 2x and 2.5x;

= Pay-out ratio, based on net income excluding non-recurring items!
post-hybrid: 55% to 65%.

With regard to operations in France, the Group expects for 2016 a higher
volume of planned outages than in 2015, with six 10-year inspections,
the replacement of the steam generators of two reactors, and the gradual
deployment of backup diesel generators as part of post-Fukushima works.
EDF is targeting between 410TWh and 415TWh of nuclear output.

Also, in the United Kingdom, EDF Energy plans to reach a nuclear output
equivalent to 2015.

2018 OUTLOOK

In February 2014, the Group announced its ambition of achieving a positive
cash flow after dividends excluding Linky in 2018. This objective has been
confirmed during the presentation of the annual results on 16 February 2016.

With respect to the net investment trajectory excluding new developments
such as Hinkley Point C or Linky, net of disposals, the Group confirms its

ambition for the investments to reach a maximum of €10.5 billion in 2018.
A plan of disposals has been set up to contribute to the financing of new
developments.

The action plan is, in addition, reliant upon the pursuit of improving the
working-capital requirement, with the objective of optimising the cash flow
by €1.8 billion in 2018, on a standardised reference. At the end of 2015,
this plan has already implied an optimisation of the 2015 working-capital
requirement by €0.7 billion.

Lastly, the plan relies on a decrease in the Group's operating costs, which
will be in 2018 €700 million below the 2015 cost base.

These targets and forward-looking statements are based on reasonable
figures, assumptions and estimations.. Those factors may change or be
modified as a result of uncertainties that may arise in the economic, financial,
competitive, regulatory and climatic environments. Moreover, if certain of the
risks described in chapter 2 (“Risk factors and control framework") of this
Reference Document were to materialise, this would have an impact on the
Group's business and its capacity to achieve its objectives. In addition, the
achievement of these targets and forward-looking statements presupposes
successful implementation of the strategy described in section 1.3 (“Group
strategy”) of this Reference Document. Consequently, EDF does not give
any undertaking or guarantee concerning the attainment of targets, and
the forward-looking information contained in this chapter concerning the
Group's financial prospects should not be used to forecast future results.
