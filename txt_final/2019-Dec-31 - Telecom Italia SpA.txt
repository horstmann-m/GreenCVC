HIGHLIGHTS OF 2019

In the last quarter of the year, management continued to accelerate the achievement of the plan’s objectives,
particularly with regard to debt, about 6 months ahead of the plan presented to the financial community last
year.

Operating free cash flow reached 3.1 billion euros, recording an improvement of 1 billion euros compared to
2018, thanks to the continuous cost reduction and optimization of working capital management. Equity free
cash flow amounted to 1.7 billion euros, up by over 1.1 billion euros YoY.

Consequently, comparable net financial debt at December 31 fell by 1.4 million euros from the end of 2018 and
by 473 million euros compared to September 30, 2019, amounting to 23.8 billion euros.

With reference to the development of strategic initiatives:

° — Network-sharing partnership with INWIT and Vodafone Italia: following the green light from the
European antitrust authority, the creation of the new INWIT and the implementation of the planned
programs for the sharing of passive mobile network infrastructure with Vodafone will be monitored, with
benefits in terms of lower capital invested and shorter development times for 5G networks.

° Fiber networks: a period of exclusivity has been granted to the KKR Infrastructure fund as financial partner
for the development of the fiber network in Italy following the submission of a non-binding offer for the
purchase of approximately 40% of TIM’s secondary fiber/copper network and in view of the desired
integration with Open Fiber.

° — Partnership for Cloud Services: signed the final agreements with Google Cloud, which start a technological
collaboration to create cloud services and enrich TIM’s technological services offering, which will lead to
the development of a business of about 1 billion euros in revenues and 400 million euros in EBITDA up to
2024.

° — Exclusive deal with Disney: the big world player in the content industry has chosen TIM Vision for the
exclusive distribution of Disney+ in Italy, confirming TIM Vision as the reference operator in the aggregation
of premium content in Italy, a position achieved in just one year.

In 2019, revenues from Group services, net of the contribution of Telecom Italia Sparkle (International
Wholesale), amounted to 15.6 billion euros (-2.6% YoY in organic terms), while total revenues reached 18.0 billion
euros (-4.9% YoY in organic terms).

Group comparable EBITDA was 7.5 billion euros, up 1.2% YoY, thanks to the ongoing cost-optimization actions
and to a positive balance of non-recurring items benefiting from 685 million euros from the favorable outcome
for TIM Brasil of the disputes over double taxation, partly offset by 756 million euros in provisions relating to staff
leaving as well as risks relating to penalties.

The Reported EBITDA - CAPEX indicator reached 3.7 billion euros, benefiting from ongoing improvement in
expenditure terms and conditions and from the levels of coverage already reached both in fixed and in mobile.

The net result attributable to shareholders of the parent company amounted to 1 billion euros (negative 1.4
billion euros in 2018).

The Board of Directors has therefore approved, for the first time since the 2013 financial year, a proposal to pay
a dividend of 0.01 euros per ordinary share. The proposed dividend for savings shares remains unchanged at
0.0275 euros.

TIM Group
PERFORMANCE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2019

Service revenues totaled 4 billion euros, down 261 million euros in organic terms compared to the fourth quarter
2018 (-6.1% YoY), due to the significant reduction in low- or zero-margin International Wholesale services
contracts started at the beginning of the year. Net of the latter impact, revenues from services were down by -
3.8% YoY at Group level and by -5.9% for the Domestic.

Total Group comparable revenues in the fourth quarter were 4.6 billion euros (-6.6% YoY on an organic basis).

In Italy, the trend of weakening of the market’s Mobile Number Portability dynamics was confirmed again in this
quarter, demonstrating greater rationality at the top end of the market while the most price-sensitive market
segment remained very competitive. The total number of TIM mobile lines was 31 million at the end of December,
slightly down compared to the previous quarter with a reduced churn rate compared to the third quarter of last
year (5.5% compared to 6.2% in 4Q 2018). The policy of reducing volumes of mobile devices sold (94 million euros
in the fourth quarter, -30% YoY) with zero or negative margins brought the expected significant EBITDA benefits.

In the fixed segment, broadband lines continued to grow (+60,000) as did the continued migration of the
customer base to the ultra-broadband (93,000 net increases in the fourth quarter, compared to 68,000 in the
third quarter).
Also in the fourth quarter, fixed line telephone prices were not increased. Retail and Wholesale fiber lines
reached 7.0 million units, up 27% YoY and 5% QoQ. Revenues from ICT continued to grow in the business
segment (+13.7% YoY), confirming and consolidating TIM's leadership in the ICT segment in terms of both offer
and market presence.

In Domestic Wholesale, service revenues benefited from the continued migration of customers from copper to
fiber, balancing the churn of copper-only customers.

In Brazil, TIM increased revenues from services by 3.2% YoY (+3.0% YoY in the third quarter) thanks to the
commercial policies implemented in the mobile segment and despite the adverse macroeconomic and market
changes, with guidance confirmed.

Group EBITDA After Lease totaled 1.8 billion euros (-1.0% YoY on organic basis).
Group organic EBITDA (IFRS 9/15) amounted to 1.9 billion euros (-1.6%) with a 40.7% EBITDA margin (+2.1 pp
YoY) thanks to the cost containment measures taken. The EBITDA of the Domestic Business Unit came to 1.4

billion euros (-4.7% YoY) while the EBITDA of TIM Brasil went up 8.3% YoY (+6.8% YoY in the third quarter).

At Group level, fourth quarter investments totaled 1.5 billion euros (-1.8% YoY) of which 1.2 billion euros in Italy
(-1.5% YoY).

NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The obligations laid down in Legislative Decree 254/2016, regarding the disclosure of sensitive information of a
non-financial nature and on diversity, have been the object of reporting by TIM Group since 1997, the year in
which the Group published its first “Social Report”, subsequently extended to cover environmental issues.

The current Sustainability Report follows a multi-stakeholder approach involving the joint analysis of actions
taken in respect of the main stakeholders with whom the Company interacts. It is based on the main reference
standard for Sustainability Reporting and on the principles (inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness) of the AA1000
AccountAbility Principles Standard (APS 2008), adopted by the Group as of the 2009 Financial Statements.

The 2019 materiality matrix, which summarizes the point of view of the Company and stakeholders, also
identified the Sustainable Development Goals which the Group considers it can significantly contribute to,
through its own operations.
The Group's commitment to integrating sustainability within its corporate strategy is proven by it being included
in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Europe (DJSI Europe) for the 16th year in a row.

TIM's presence in the Dow Jones is added to other important world indexes, including the FTSE4Good and
Euronext Vigeo Eiris.

For more details of TIM's approach to sustainability and results achieved, see the 2019 Sustainability Report -
Non-Financial Disclosure.

INTRODUCTION

The TIM Group and TIM S.p.A. Consolidated Financial Statements for 2019 and the comparative figures for
the previous year have been prepared in compliance with the IFRS issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board and endorsed by the European Union ("IFRS").

The accounting criteria and consolidation principles adopted are homogeneous with those used when

drawing up the Consolidated Financial Statements of the TIM Group and the Separate Financial Statements

of TIM S.p.A. at December 31, 2018, except for the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) adopted starting from January

1, 2019 with the modified retrospective method (that is, without recalculating the comparative figures of

previous years), whose effects are explained in the Note "Accounting Policies - Adoption of the new IFRS 16

(Leases) standard" to which reference is made for further details. It should be noted that, starting from

January 1, 2018, the TIM Group adopted IFRS 15 (Revenues from contracts with customers) and IFRS 9

(Financial instruments).

To allow the comparability of the economic and financial performances of 2019 with the previous year,

the financial figures and main income statement balances of 2019 are shown in this Report on Operations

in a "comparable" layout, using the previous IAS 17 (Leases) accounting standard and relevant
interpretations (IFRIC 4, SIC 15 and SIC 27) in order to distinguish between operating and finance leases
and the resulting booking of the lease contracts payable.

TIM Group, in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by the IFRS, uses

certain alternative performance measures in order to present a better understanding of the trend of

operations and financial condition. Specifically, these alternative performance measures refer to:

EBITDA; EBIT; organic change and impact of the non-recurring items on revenues, EBITDA and EBIT;

EBITDA margin and EBIT margin; and net financial debt carrying amount and adjusted net financial debt.

Following the adoption of IFRS 16, the TIM Group also presents the following additional alternative

performance indicators:

(1) EBITDA adjusted After Lease (“EBITDA-AL”), calculated by adjusting the Organic EBITDA, net of the
non-recurring items, from the amounts connected with the accounting treatment of the finance
leasing contracts according to IAS 17 (applied until year-end 2018) and according to IFRS 16 (applied
starting from 2019);

(2) Adjusted net financial debt After Lease, calculated by excluding the liabilities connected with the
accounting treatment of the finance leasing contracts from the adjusted net financial debt according
to IAS 17 (applied until year-end 2018) and according to IFRS 16 (applied starting from 2019).

The meaning and content of the alternative performance indicators are provided in the "Alternative
performance indicators" chapter; analytical detail of the amounts of the reclassifications introduced and
of the methods for determining indicators is also provided.
Lastly, the section entitled "Business Outlook for the year 2020" contains forward-looking statements in
relation to the Group's intentions, beliefs or current expectations regarding financial performance and other
aspects of the Group's operations and strategies. Readers of this Annual Financial Report are reminded not
to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements; in fact, actual results may differ significantly from
forecasts owing to risks and uncertainties depending on numerous factors, the majority of which are beyond
the scope of the Group’s control. Please refer to the "Main risks and uncertainties" section for more
information. It provides a detailed description of the major risks pertaining to the TIM Group business activity
which can, even considerably, affect its ability to meet the set goals.

NON-RECURRING EVENTS

In the years 2019 and 2018, the TIM Group recognized non-recurring net operating expenses connected to
events and transactions that by their nature do not occur on an ongoing basis in the normal course of operations
and which have been shown because their amount is significant. Non-recurring charges include, among others,
any goodwill impairment changes, provisions for regulatory disputes and potential liabilities related to them,
liabilities with customers and/or suppliers, and charges associated with corporate reorganization/restructuring
and prior-year adjustments. In 2019, the positive effect from the recognition in the Brazil and Domestic Business
Units of receivables consequent to the favorable result of disputes is also noted.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PERFORMANCE

Revenues

Total TIM Group revenues amounted to 17,974 million euros for the year 2019.

Comparable revenues - recognized on the basis of the accounting standards consistent with those adopted in
2018 - amounted to 17,977 million euros, down by 5.1% compared to 2018 (18,940 million euros); organic change
in total revenues was -4.9%.

TIM Group revenues from services, not including the contribution coming from the Telecom Italia Sparkle group,
which is repositioning its business with the exit from voice contracts with lower margins, amounted to 15,608
million euros, in organic terms, down 2.6% compared to 2018 (16,021 million euros).

The Telecom Italia Sparkle group underwent market repositioning in 2019, which at the end of the year made it
possible to achieve progressive and significant integration of the Sparkle group's business with the Core Domestic
business. This integration is linked to the transformation of the Sparkle group, aimed at innovating the traditional
business by focusing on more innovative areas that can meet the challenges of the new Gigabit Society.
Therefore, starting from the end of 2019, the distinction between Core Domestic and International Wholesale no
longer applies, with information provided solely for the Domestic Business Unit.

Total TIM Group revenues amounted to 4,551 million euros for the fourth quarter of 2019; comparable revenues
amounted to 4,554 million euros, a decrease of 320 million euros in organic terms (-6.6%). TIM Group revenues
from services, not including the contribution by the Telecom Italia Sparkle group amounted to 3,834 million euros
in organic terms, down 3.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.

The breakdown of total revenues for the year 2019 by operating segment in comparison with 2018 is as follows:

(millions of euros) 2019 2018 Change
comparable
% organic
% of total % of total amount % excluding

Consolidated Total __ 17,977 100.0; 18,940 100.0 (963) (5.1) (4.9)

The organic change in consolidated revenues of the Group for the year 2019 is calculated leaving out the negative
effect of the changes in exchange rates, totaling -81 million euros, non-recurring expenses of 15 million euros
(62 million euros in 2018) attributable to adjustments to revenues from previous years and the effect of the
change in consolidation scope due to the sale of Persidera S.p.A. for -6 million euros.

EBITDA

Reported EBITDA for 2019 was 8,151 million euros, and benefited, for the amount of 662 million euros, from the
application of IFRS 16 following which, with reference to lease liabilities covered by the standard, the lease
payments are no longer recognized as costs for acquisition of goods and services, but a financial liability must
be recognized in the statements of financial position, represented by the current value of future payments, and
the right of use under assets, amortized along the probable term of the contact with the relevant finance
expenses posted to the income statement.

Comparable EBITDA for the year 2019 - prepared on the basis of accounting standards consistent with those
adopted in 2018 - amounted to 7,489 million euros (7,403 million euros in 2018; +1.2%), with an EBITDA margin
of 41.7% (39.1% in 2018; +2.6 percentage points).

(1) The average exchange rates used for the translation into euro (expressed in terms of units of local currency per 1 euro) were 4.41422 in 2019 and
4.30628 in 2018 for the Brazilian real. For the US dollar, the average exchange rates used were 1.11954 in 2019 and 1.18121 in 2018. The effect of
the change in exchange rates is calculated by applying the foreign currency translation rates used for the current period to the period under
comparison.

Organic EBITDA - net of the non-recurring items amounted to 7,560 million euros; the EBITDA margin was 42.0% (7,774
million euros in 2018, with an EBITDA margin of 41.1%).
Specifically, EBITDA for 2019 reflected a negative impact totaling 71 million euros (negative for 408 million euros in 2018)
referring to net non-recurring expenses as already described.

For further details, see the Note "Non-recurring events and transactions" in the Consolidated Financial Statements as
at December 31, 2019 of the TIM Group.

Organic EBITDA, net of the non-recurring component, is calculated as follows:

Exchange rate fluctuations mainly related to the Brazil Business Unit, while the effect of the change in the scope
of consolidation was connected with the sale of Persidera S.p.A..

EBITDA was particularly impacted by the change in the line iterns analyzed below:

The decrease mainly relates to the Domestic Business Unit for around -952 million euros and the Brazil Business
Unit for around -98 million euros.

Regarding the Domestic Business Unit, the change was mainly due to both the decrease in purchases of goods
for resale, linked to the decrease in sold volumes of mobile handsets, in line with the repositioning of the current

The net decrease of 28 million euros was mainly driven by:

the decrease of 78 million euros of ordinary employee expenses in the Italian component, mainly due to the
benefits related to the reduction in the average salaried workforce amounting to a total of -2,428 average
employees, of which -319 average employees related to the "Solidarity Agreement", which expired in June 2019
and the subsequent expansion contract applied with effect from August 2019;

the increase of 43 million euros mainly for restructuring expenses in the Italian component. Provisions in 2019,
amounting to 267 million euros, were related both to the revised estimate and start date for staff leaving the Parent
scheduled for the 2020 financial year (also in accordance with the application of article 4 of the Law of June 28, 2012,
no. 92, as last defined in the union agreement of February 26, 2019) and the expenses recognized in light of the
agreements signed by Olivetti on July 12, 2019, by H.R. Services on November 29, 2019 and Telecom Italia Sparkle on
December 18, 2019 with the trade unions, based on the application of article 4 of the Law of June 28, 2012, no. 92. In
2018, provisions were made for expenses totaling 224 million euros following the updated actuarial measurements for
provisions related to the application of Article 4, of Italian Law no. 92 of June 28, 2012;

the increase of 7 million euros of the outside Italy component, mainly for restructuring and other expenses.

non-recurring), connected with the recognition of tax credits consequent to the favorable result of the tax
disputes connected to the inclusion of the ICMS indirect tax in the basis of calculation of the taxes on PIS and
COFINS revenues, which the company has been pursuing in court since 2006, with requests for reimbursement
referring - as is allowed - to the previous five years, and therefore with effect from 2001. The amount includes
407 million euros related to the recovery of indirect taxes and 278 million euros for the legal revaluation.

The use of the recognized tax receivables started from the end of 2019, in compliance with the formal
ification procedures established by the Brazilian tax authorities with a conjectured horizon of three years,
will be subject to taxation; therefore, deferred direct taxes with a similar time horizon were recognized for a

cer
and

total of 233 million euros.

Oth

er operating income also includes a non-recurring component of 21 million euros relating to the recognition

by

he Parent of receivables for the repayment of the fine relating to Antitrust Case 1761, following the ruling of

68 million euros was carried out;

° net losses related to the disposal of equipment and other assets of the Domestic Business Unit.

Net impairment losses on non-current assets

In 2019, this item amounted to nil.

Report on Operations of the Key Operating and Financial Data - TIM Group | 16
TIM Group
In 2018, net impairment losses on non-current assets amounted to 2,586 million euros (2,590 million euros, net
of 4 million euros of impairment reversals). Impairment losses for 2018 (2,590 million euros) refer to the goodwill
impairment loss attributable to the Core Domestic unit and International Wholesale. Further details are provided
in the Note “Goodwill” to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2018 of the TIM Group.

EBIT

Reported EBIT amounted to 3,175 million euros for 2019.

Comparable EBIT for 2019, net of the impact of IFRS 16 of 117 million euros, amounted to 3,058 million euros (561
million euros for 2018), an increase of 2,497 million euros compared to 2018, the EBIT margin stood at 17.0%
(3.0% in 2018).

In detail, in 2019, the TIM Group recognized non-recurring charges of the Domestic and Brazil Business Units,
totaling 89 million euros, mainly relating to provisions for regulatory disputes and potential related liabilities, to
liabilities with customers and/or suppliers and to charges related to corporate reorganization/restructuring as
well as the capital loss realized following the sale of Persidera S.p.A. and the adjustments to revenues from
previous years;

In 2018, net non-recurring operating expenses attributable to EBIT amounted to 2,998 million euros, including
the abovementioned goodwill write-down.

For further details, see the Note "Non-recurring events and transactions" in the Consolidated Financial
Statements as at December 31, 2019 of the TIM Group.

Exchange rate fluctuations mainly related to the Brazil Business Unit.

Finance income (expenses), net

Finance income (expenses) showed an expense of 1,436 million euros.

On the same accounting basis, without taking into account the effects of the adoption of the new IFRS 16,
financial income/(expense) showed an expense of 1,237 million euros (expense of 1,348 million euros in 2018):
the improvement was mainly driven by lower finance expenses, connected to the reduction in the Group’s
average debt exposure and a drop in interest rates.

Income tax expense

This item amounted to 513 million euros, up by 138 million euros on 2018 (375 million euros). Specifically, the
figure for 2018 included 200 million euros of deferred tax assets from the Brazil Business Unit, related to the tax
recoverability of past losses recorded in previous years. In the 2019 financial year, the reduction in taxes paid by
the Parent (-244 million euros) due to the contraction in the taxable base, was mainly offset by the higher
deferred tax liabilities recognized by the Brazil Business Unit mainly against the aforementioned non-recurring
income relating to tax credits following the favorable outcome of the disputes relating to the inclusion of the
ICMS tax in the basis for calculating the PIS/COFINS contribution.

Profit (loss) from Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale

Profit from Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale of 16 million euros relates to a partial
repayment of taxes, whose collection became certain in 2019, connected to the sale of the Sofora-Telecom
Argentina group in 2016.

The Telecom Italia Sparkle group underwent market repositioning in 2019, which at the end of the year made it
possible to achieve progressive and significant integration of the Sparkle group's business with the Core Domestic
business. This integration is linked to the transformation of the Sparkle group, aimed at innovating the traditional
business by focusing on more innovative areas that can meet the challenges of the new Gigabit Society. Therefore,
starting from the end of 2019, the distinction between Core Domestic and International Wholesale no longer
applies, with information provided solely for the Domestic Business Unit.

As a result, the data for the year was restated in order to provide a homogeneous representation.

Revenues

In order to bear in mind the changed market context and types of offer, starting from 2019 the breakdown of
revenues and the itemization of some commercial indicators have been revised; as a result, also the comparative
2018 figures have been updated in order to provide a homogeneous representation. In detail, Revenues are
represented by distinguishing between those deriving from offers of only Services or packages of Services
(Revenues from stand alone Services) and those deriving from so-called “bundle” offers that include the customer
signing a contract providing for the purchase of devices/products jointly with the rendering of a service along a
certain time span (Handset and Bundle & Handset revenues).

Domestic Business Unit revenues amounted to 14,081 million euros, down 950 million euros (-6.3%) compared to
2018.

Revenues from Stand alone services amounted to 12,588 million euros (-764 million euros compared to 2018,
equal to -5.7%) and were affected by the effects of the changed regulatory and competitive scenario. Not including
the revenues of the international wholesale component, down compared to 2018 following the review of the
Sparkle group in the voice business, with better focused contracts having higher margins, revenues from services
amounted to 11,879 million euros in organic terms (-493 million euros compared to 2018, equal to -4.0%).

In detail:

= revenues from Fixed market Stand alone services amounted to 9,364 million euros, down 511 million euros
(-5.2%) compared to 2018. Not including the revenues of the international wholesale component, down
compared to the same period of 2018 following the review of the Sparkle group in the Voice Business, revenues
from fixed services fell by 2.0%, in a challenging competitive and market context. The increased retail ARPU,
growth in revenues from ICT solutions (+107 million euros compared to the previous year, +14.1%) and from
broadband services (+89 million euros, +3.8%), only partly offset the natural decline in revenues from voice
services resulting from the decreased accesses;

= Stand alone revenues from services in the Mobile business came to 3,775 million euros (-332 million euros,
-8.1% compared to 2018) and were affected by the impact of the changed regulatory environment and
competitive, with a fall in the ARPU, but a progressive recovery during the quarters of 2019 (-11.4% in the first
quarter, -9.6% in the second, -7.2% in the third, -3.8% in the fourth).

Revenues from Handsets and Bundles & Handsets, including the change in work in progress, amounted to 1,493
million euros in 2019 (-186 million euros on the previous year).

Domestic Business Unit revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 amounted to 3,558 million euros, down 291 million
euros (-7.6%) compared to same period of the previous year.

As regards the market segments of the Domestic Business Unit, please note the following changes compared to
2018:

Consumer: the segment consists of all Fixed and Mobile voice and Internet services and products managed
and developed for individuals and families and of public telephony; customer care, operating credit support,
loyalty and retention activities, sales within its remit, and administrative management of customers; includes
the company TIM Retail, which coordinates the activities of flagship stores. Revenues of the Consumer
segment 2019 totaled 6,594 million euros and decreased by 786 million euros (-10.7%) compared to 2018, also
due to the different competitive and regulatory context. The trend seen in total revenues also applied to
revenues from stand alone services, which amounted to 5,800 million euros, down by 7.7% compared to the
previous year (-481 million euros). In particular:

revenues from Stand alone Mobile services amounted to 2,569 million euros and posted a decrease of
246 million euros (-8.7%) compared to 2018, mainly due to the changed regulatory and competitive
dynamics which increased the churn rate and put pressure on ARPU levels; moreover, in the fourth quarter
there was an improvement in the trend over the same period of the previous year;
revenues from Fixed market Stand alone services amounted to 3,253 million euros, down compared to
2018 (-244 million euros, equal to -7.0%); this trend reflected a decrease in accesses, only partly offset by
higher ARPU levels. The growth of Broadband customers is highlighted, in particular Ultra Broadband.

Revenues for Handsets and Bundles & handsets in the Consumer segment amounted to 794 million euros,
down 305 million euros compared to 2018 (-27.8%), concentrated on the mobile sector following the change
in the product sales strategy, focused on protecting margins.

Business: the segment consists of voice, data, and Internet services and products, and ICT solutions managed
and developed for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), Small Offices/Home Offices (SOHOs), Top
customers, the Public Sector, Large Accounts, and Enterprises in the Fixed and Mobile telecommunications
markets. The segment includes the companies Olivetti, Tl Trust Technologies and Telsy. Revenues for the
Business segment amounted to 4,627 million euros, down by 51 million euros on 2018 (-1.1%, of which -2.9%
for revenues from the stand alone services component). In particular:

mobile revenues show a negative performance compared to the previous year (-9.9%), driven mainly by
lower revenues from stand alone services (-9.8%) from the reduction in ARPU levels;

Fixed-line revenues grew by 62 million euros compared to 2018 (+1.7%) while revenues from services
remained substantially the same: lower prices and revenues from traditional services (also connected
with the technological shift towards VoIP systems and solutions) were almost completely offset by steady
growth in revenues from ICT services.

National Wholesale Market: the segment consists of the management and development of the portfolio of
regulated and unregulated wholesale services for Fixed-line and Mobile telecommunications operators in the
domestic market. The segment includes the companies TN Fiber, Tl San Marino and Telefonia Mobile
Sammarinese. The National Wholesale Market segment revenues in 2019 came to 1,843 million euros, up by
68 million euros (+3.8%) compared to 2018, with a positive performance mainly driven by the growth in
accesses in the Ultra Broadband segment.

Report on Operations of the Financial and Operating Highlights of the Business Units of the TIM Group | 24
TIM Group Domestic Business Unit
International Wholesale Market: includes the activities of the Telecom Italia Sparkle group, which operates
in the market for international voice, data and Internet services for fixed and mobile telecommunications

operators, ISPs/ASPs (Wholesale market) and multinational com

panies through its own networks in the

European, Mediterranean and South American markets. Revenues for the International Wholesale Market
segment for 2019 totaled 947 million euros, showing a drop of 325 million euros (-25.6%) on the 2018 figure.

This trend is mainly connected to the new positioning of Telecom

Italia Sparkle in the Voice business, with

better focused contracts having higher margins, also in a perspective of simplifying and streamlining

operating processes.
Other: includes:

INWIT S.p.A.: from April 2015, the company has been operating within the Operations area in the
electronic communications infrastructure sector, specifically relating to infrastructure for housing radio
transmission equipment for mobile telephone networks, both for TIM and other operators. As previously
indicated, at December 31, 2019, Inwit is presented as an "Asset held for sale" and the income data and
cash flows of the Domestic Business Unit for 2019 include the data for the entire year of Inwit S.p.A.;

Other Operations units: covering technological innovation and development, engineering, construction
and operating processes for network infrastructures, IT, real estate properties and plant engineering; the
Flash Fiber company and Open Access operations connected with delivery and assurance of customer

services are also included, until September 2019 included in the Wholesale segment and now reclassified

following the change in organizational structure;

= Staff & Other: services carried out by Staff functions and other support activities performed by minor
companies, including Persidera, included in income and cash flows until the date of disposal (December

2, 2019).

EBITDA

Reported EBITDA of the Domestic Business Unit for 2019 amounted to 5,708 million euros as it benefited from

the application of IFRS 16 by the amount of 363 million euros.

Comparable EBITDA in 2019 amounted to 5,345 million euros, down 610 million euros (-10.2%) compared to 2018.
Organic EBITDA, net of the non-recurring component, amounted to 6,041 million euros, down 321 million euros
(-5.0%) compared to 2018. In particular, EBITDA in 2019 was negatively impacted by 696 million euros, referring to
non-recurring charges mainly related to provisions for regulatory disputes and related liabilities, to liabilities with
customers and/or suppliers and to charges related to corporate reorganization/restructuring as well as to cited

adjustments to revenues from previous years.

Organic EBITDA, net of the non-recurring component, is calculated as follows:

This item fell by 952 million euros compared to 2018. In particular, there was a reduction in purchases for resale,
linked to the drop in the volumes of mobile handsets sold, in line with the repositioning of the current commercial
strategies, a reduction in the revenue shares to be transferred to other operators and costs for access to
telecommunications networks, partially offset by an increase in commercial and advertising costs.

= Employee benefits expenses 2,753 million euros; 2,753 million euros on comparable basis; 2,781 million

Revenues

Revenues for 2019 for the TIM Brasil group amounted to 17,377 million reais, up by 396 million reais compared to
2018 (+2.3%).

Revenues from services totaled 16,597 million reais, an increase of 391 million reais compared to 16,206 million
reais for 2018 (+2.4%).

Revenues from product sales totaled 780 million reais (775 million reais in 2018). The increase reflects the change
in the sales policy, which is now focused more on value than on increasing sales volumes. The main goals of the
new strategy are to increase purchases of new connected devices giving TIM customers access to broadband
services on 3G/4G networks and to support new retention offerings for higher-value postpaid customers.

Revenues of the fourth quarter of 2019 were equal to 4,586 million reais, an increase of 2.9% compared to the
same period of the previous year (4,457 million reais).

Mobile Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) was 23.7 reais in 2019, up on the 22.5 reais recorded in 2018, thanks to
the global repositioning towards the postpaid segment and new commercial initiatives aimed at promoting data
use and the average spend per customer.

Total lines in place at December 31, 2019 amounted to 54.4 million, a decline of 1.5 million compared to
December 31, 2018 (55.9 million). The lower figure was driven entirely by the prepaid segment (-2.7 million), only
partially offset by growth in the postpaid segment (+1.2 million), in part due to the consolidation underway in
the market for second SIM cards. Postpaid customers accounted for 39.4% of the customer base at December
31, 2019, an increase of 3.2 percentage points on December 2018 (36.2%).

EBITDA

Reported EBITDA for 2019 amounted to 10,820 million reais.

Comparable EBITDA in 2019 amounted to 9,505 million reais, an increase of 3,189 million reais (+50.5%).
EBITDA in 2019 includes 2,760 million reais of net non-recurring income (2 million reais in 2018) attributable to
the recognition of tax receivables for an amount equal to 3,024 million reais (following recognition by the Brazilian
Federal Supreme Court ("STF") that the inclusion of ICMS in the basis for calculating the PIS/COFINS contributions
was unconstitutional), offset by charges for non-recurring expenses for an amount equal to 264 million reais,
mainly consisting of provisions for regulatory disputes and potential related liabilities, liabilities with customers
and/or suppliers and charges for corporate reorganization/restructuring.

EBITDA, net of the non-recurring component, was equal to 6,745 million reais and calculated as follows:

MAIN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC

Consumer

TIM is driving the country's digital revolution, continuing to invest in innovation through the development of fixed
and mobile Ultrabroadband networks, platforms and highly customized quality services based on customer
needs. TIM is also committed to spreading a digital culture for leisure, offering innovative, flexible and
increasingly convergent products that boast the best multimedia content, with filrns, TV series, music, video
games, sports' news and major events, delivered through decoders, smart TVs, the Web and mobile apps.

In 2019, TIM continued to develop the fixed-line consumer market with its new TIM Super deal, aimed at
providing families with a complete solution for all their needs: connectivity, security, entertainment, smart home.
TIM Super launched in June and starts from € 35 per month, offering a Fiber connection of up to 1GB with Best
Technology Available logic, a TIM modem, TIM Vision and the option to choose between security, smart home,
unlimited voice calls and assistance.

To support new BroadBand and UltraBroadBand customer activation, the offer was further expanded during
2019, making the selling proposition easier, introducing more aggressive price points and targeted promotions to
push direct debits and support churn reduction.

Throughout 2019, TIM continued to support the adoption of new fiber technology with offers for ADSL
customers already covered by the FTTCab and FFTH service to upgrade to the new technology without additional
costs and leveraging on new offer content different to that of the market. The Smart Home and Safe Web
browsing security services in the TIM Super portfolio are examples of this, in addition to family SIM with a mobile
sim linked to the Fiber offer or Giga benefits linked to fixed-line direct debit payments.

To support the net balance of the fixed-line market, the TIM Super offer was further expanded with a second
home offer, TIM Flexy, a new connection concept with rechargeable FTTC technology for non-continuous home
navigation use.

Close strategic partnerships with major players play a decisive role in supporting the Fixed-line segment, as does
the significant content push and the launch of bundled offers for home use with the use of the TIM box decoder
and Fiber quality. In August, the Kit Sport offer was launched, initially with NOW TV from SKY and subsequently
with the complete Serie A and B football championship package and major sporting events, thanks also to the
Dazn bundle. The package costs 29.99 euros per month with discounted or free promotions used to encourage
take up during the various sporting seasons. Other content offers, including a wide range of films and TV series,
such as that from Chili, together with TIM Vision, are important and unique levers to support the fixed-line
segment, also with the ability to add the services to bills.

In October, the TIM Internet FWA family offer was launched, again to encourage greater spread in the fixed-line
segment, at the very competitive price of 24.90 euros per month. With FWA technology and dedicated indoor or
outdoor modems, it allows internet browsing at 30Mega download and 3Mega upload speeds even in those
areas (e.g. White Areas) without Fiber coverage.

As regards the Mobile sector, TIM continued to support the development of 4G and 4.5G ultrabroadband during
2019, achieving important goals - and first and foremost its download speed record in Ookla tests.

At national level, 4G technology has now reached more than 7,600 municipalities, covering over 99% of the
population. The company continued the steady roll-out to Italy’s major cities of 4.5G services (LTE Advanced
technology), which offer data connection speeds of up to 700 Megabits per second.

TIM's technological leadership was confirmed with the launch of 5G frequencies, which are fundamental for the
future development of mobile services that can revolutionize the lives of citizens, consumers and businesses
alike, steering the country towards a dimension in which everything is smarter and more connected: from public
safety to transport, from environmental monitoring to health, tourism and culture, and even applications for
media, education and virtual reality.

TIM 5G is already available with services for citizens and businesses in Italy's main cities with speeds of up
to 2 Gigabytes per second: Rome, Turin, Florence and Naples were the first cities covered, with Bologna, Genoa,
Brescia and Monza added more recently, including the first 5G connected racetrack in Europe. By 2021, 120 cities
will have cover, as will 200 tourist destinations, 245 industrial districts and 200 specific projects for large
enterprises.

TIM is also continuing its 5G development path with a number of live service trials in the Smart City, healthcare,
tourism and culture fields. The latest during the Monza Rally Show 2019, where spectators were able to
experience and test the new 5G enabled services: self-driving cars, Smart City and Public Security, Cloud Gaming,
Virtual Reality and 360° 4K Video for experiencing live events in an innovative and engaging way.

Technological leadership means a competitive edge for TIM, which is fundamental for making it mark in a highly
competitive market. By making the most of the distinctive quality of the network, TIM has been able to continue
its “value” strategy and focus on the quality of its offering, maintaining a premium position on the market.

TIM Group
Another essential aspect of its business strategy was customer retention, with the focus on reducing churn rates
and stabilizing customer spending. With this in mind, offer portfolios were launched on the market with content
benefits and discounted fees for customers who choose direct debit or credit card debit as their payment
method.

Plus, to increase customer awareness and satisfaction, TIM Party was launched - the retention program for all
TIM customers that can only be accessed online.

The program has three levels:

™ extensive benefits for all customers joining the program;

™ specific benefits for clusters selected based on how long customers have been with TIM and the presence of
several TIM services (3Play, 4Play);

™ competitions with prizes.

TIM Party, with its innovative, differentiated format, aims to increase customer retention, the penetration of
services and the digital customer base.

Finally, and still with a view to improving customer loyalty, during February 2020 agreements between TIM S.p.A.
and Santander Consumer Bank S.p.A. were signed, launching a partnership to offer a consumer credit platform
dedicated to TIM's customers, as announced in November 2019.

Thanks to the partnership, instalment plan financing for product purchases will be progressively rolled out in all
TIM stores. They will subsequently also offer personal loans, credit cards and insurance products designed to
meet customers' needs, with a high degree of innovation and digitalisation, both of which have always been
hallmarks of the two companies.

The launch of consumer credit services is the first step following the development of the new joint venture, will
begin operating once the necessary authorization has been obtained. It will allow TIM to further reduce debt and
optimize credit costs. TIM customers will also gain quick and easy access to customised and transparent financial
and insurance solutions, strengthening and improving the continuity of customer relationships.

Business

TIM's work in the Business market during 2019 focused on four main areas:

™ further strengthening Customer Base retention with structural action targeting offers as well as Customer
Experience, through customer care activities and a "more for more policy" that makes the most of TIM's
profile as an integrated operator;

= improving commercial monitoring of the market, above all by increasing the proximity of direct and indirect
sales channels;

™ expanding its footprint in the ICT market by increasing products targeting “over-the-network” services and
data deals for the large customer segment and through “off-the-shelf” cloud based computing solutions for
SMEs.

The main goals of 2019 were protecting the Customer Base and consolidating TIM's position as a national player
that can meet the IT needs of SMEs, large companies and the public administration. These goals were pursued
by maintaining a distinctive product offering and consolidating the commercial front end, which has also been
functional in the gradual migration of the services mix used by customers towards more updated models based
on the extensive adoption of fixed network Fiber/VoIP connectivity, mobile network LTE and Cloud solutions.
Considerable effort has gone into developing the ARPU, through bundle deals and by leveraging professional
services that are distinctive and highly visible.
For the fixed-line network in particular, on one hand, TIM has further simplified its offers for the SOHO-SME
segment, focusing on Fiber and VoIP solutions and on the other, has expanded the Business market with the
aunch of Fixed Wireless Access solutions.
Loyalty and ARPU growth support activities saw the introduction of bundles including Mobile, with the TIM 100%
offer, and with the creation of "More 4 More" Triple Protection offers.
For Unified Communication services (TIM Integrated Smart Communication offer), in convergence with mobile
network services and IT services, focus continued on improving Time 2 Market.
Customer care management benefited from new customer segmentation that combines customer value with
technological equipment and pre-retention activities leveraging predictive models were strengthened.

The proposition of cloud computing services was stepped up further, offering - alongside consolidated VoIP and
advanced Collaboration service -the “cloud-on premise” deal with SIP trunking as part of the TIM Comunicazione
Integrata, in synergy with the development of IT services.

Development of the Information Technology offer focused on expanding hybrid and public cloud solutions,
through the definition of strategic partnerships with the main OTTs and the consolidation of IT offers delivered
in bundles with fixed-line and mobile connectivity. Furthermore, work was done to consolidate the "Vertical" loT
offer, with the collaboration with partners and investee companies in specific areas (e.g. fleet management) and

Report on Operations of the Main Commercial Developments | 29
TIM Group
M2M Narrowband IoT solutions. In parallel, the bouquet of Analytics-based services was further developed by
integrating TIM and Olivetti platform solutions with third-party applications to expand the informative and
strategic value of Big data solutions.

The integration of connectivity deals with public cloud services managed by TIM was exemplified by the launch of the
TIM Safe Web secure DNS deal for all segments of the Business market. Protection with these security services reached
over 600,000 customer accesses, blocking over a billion IT threats.

The TIM Multicloud project was launched, providing hybrid services which include TIM Cloud Business solutions, On
Customer Premises components and the main OTTs' Public Clouds (Amazon, Microsoft, Google). The strength of the
MultiCloud solution is the Cloud Management Platform (CMP) which allows the customer to monitor the entire
architecture in terms of management, systems and cost control. The IT offering for SMEs (Small and Medium
Enterprises) continued to be developed with the Digital Store Market Place featuring around 170 solutions for SMEs, also
developed by partners in the TIM Open environment, using both a horizontal and vertical approach to new e-commerce,
e-payment, security, and video control solutions, to give just a few examples. In addition, the portfolio has been
expanded with a new range of offers for SMEs taking a consultancy approach to digital transformation, accompanying
the customer in choosing the most suitable services for their needs.

TIM announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Google Cloud to define a strategic partnership.

In relation to Mobile services in 2019:

. he development of the Ultra BroadBand Mobile service continued, based on the spread of VoLTE boosted by the
aunch of 5G for the entire business customer base, and with enabled vertical applications (e.g. industry 4.0, smart
city);
. he fixed-mobile-ICT convergence proposition was strengthened, with a dedicated "TIM 100%" product and the
introduction of a single invoice and assistance service, giving customers the benefits of TIM's position as the only
convergent operator;

he value-based purchasing strategy continued with an offer based on flexible pricing that maximizes commercial
effectiveness and profitability;

he "more money for more value" approach continued with the offer portfolio being expanded to include VAS and
T bundle solutions; for example with TIM Safe WEB, which takes advantage of the TIM network, guaranteeing both
mobile and fixed-line security.

During 2019, Olivetti focused on growing turnover generated by digital solution products (loT and Data Monetization)
and on the product (office and retail) efficiency recovery area; in particular, product marketing has been able to respond
to the high demand created by the introduction of new legislation on electronic invoicing requirements (so-called "E-
invoicing"). Olivetti's market skills and innovative technologies have allowed it to develop - mainly in the field of
electronic payments, smart metering, tracking - new platforms and solutions, based on sensors that use Narrowband
loT technology.

BRAZIL

In 2019, TIM Brazil completed the renewal its range of offers to reposition the brand with high-value customers,
leveraging its dominant position in the 4G network (cover and availability).

This new approach has had a profound impact on the customer base composition, mainly in the prepaid segment,
leading to an intense and progressive migration from single-service daily tariff plans (voice and/or data) to
weekly/monthly rolling plans that combine voice packages and data to other digital value-added services (music, e-
reading, video streaming). The aim is to stabilize the flow of future revenues and proactively manage the current
consolidation of the second SIM market.

The main sales initiatives included:

™ greater simplification with a new prepaid segment concept, which combines top-up with a service package (TIM Pre
TOP) able to offer complete and distinct solutions for voice and data services and unlimited social network packages
for a specific period (two weeks);

™ consolidation of high-end segment presence with entertainment hub concept. The TIM Controle offer includes
unlimited social media network use (WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, Telegram and Waze) and other unlimited
social media networks for three months (Instagram, Facebook and Twitter), a 5 GB data package and unlimited calls
to anyone, at a cost of 49.99 reais per month;

in June 2019, TIM introduced another innovation with TIM Black Familia. The new portfolio introduces the
entertainment hub concept with the launch of the first product in Brazil which includes a Netflix subscription.
Customers will see shared benefits, in addition to Deezer's TIM Music, international roaming, data rollovers,
unlimited social media network use and more autonomy in managing data limits. A device was also introduced as
an important product selling aid and to avoid the price/GB war;

5G is already a worldwide target. It is not yet clear when and how the spectrum will be auctioned in Brazil.
Nevertheless, TIM has taken a leading role, researching applications and creating the right context for the
technology's launch, with tests on the real network that will affect all suppliers (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia) and in-
store tests involving customers with 5G technology;

Fixed: The focus on investing in FTTH (Fiber To The Home) expansion continues, with higher speed offers and optimal
connection stability. TIM began investing in this type of technology in the fourth quarter of 2017, closing the fourth

quarter of 2019 with a number of families with FTTH service equal to 28% of the TIM fixed broadband customer
base;

in the last 12 months TIM Live Internet, residential broadband via the mobile network (WTTX), has been launched
in 43 new cities.

MAIN CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK

DOMESTIC

In this section we report the main changes in the regulatory framework in 2019 in the Domestic region.

As regards the Antitrust proceedings (A514, 1799, 1820, PS11379, IP312, PS11532 and |P327), as well as the
proceedings regarding the 28-day invoicing, see the Note “Disputes and pending legal actions, other information,
commitments and guarantees” in the TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2019.

New EU Electronic Communications Code

The (EU) 2018/1972 Directive, which establishes the new European Electronic Communications Code (Code), will
be applicable in Member States after its transposition into national laws, which must take place by 21 December
2020.

The Code reviews and replaces the previous European regulatory framework made up of the Access Directive,
Framework Directive, Authorization Directive and the Universal Service Directive.

The main changes concern the regulation of access/interconnection, spectrum management and Universal
Service obligations.

Access and interconnection regulation

The new rules aim to stimulate investment in very high capacity networks while continuing to protect
competition and the interests of end users.
The Code identifies two regulatory models, aimed at promoting efficient investment in access networks:

= the "wholesale-only" model, where the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) may exempt operators with
Significant Market Power (SPM) who offer communication services from certain obligations, including cost
orientation electronics exclusively in wholesale markets, imposing only the obligations of non-
discrimination, access and fair and reasonable pricing on them;

= the co-investment model, where the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) will be able to exempt significant
market power operators' Very High Capacity Networks - VHCNs from any obligation, on condition they are
built on the basis of a co-investment offer open to anyone and access to the network is guaranteed with
transparent and non-discriminatory conditions.

The Code also privileges the obligation of access to infrastructures over other ex ante obligations and extends
the possibility of imposing symmetric access obligations on essential network infrastructures beyond the first
distribution/concentration point. It introduces longer market review periods (five years instead of three) to offer
operators greater certainty and provides for the European Commission to set EU price caps for mobile and fixed
termination rates applicable to all operators active on termination markets.

Spectrum management

The Code introduces new rules for the development of mobile and 5G networks, including the minimum duration
of rights to use of frequencies, equal to 15 years with an extension of an additional 5, and the right for operators
to install small cells on public infrastructure, such as electric poles and traffic lights.

Universal Service obligations

The Code provides an obligation for all broadband internet access service and fixed location voice
communication services providers to ensure "financial accessibility" for residential users (in particular those with
a low-income or special social needs). However, Member States are free to impose universal service obligations
(including coverage obligations where necessary) on designated companies (as is currently the case).

Each Member State must decide what is appropriate broadband internet access; the access speed must at least
allow end users to use the services listed in Annex V of the Code.

A Member State can continue to impose obligations related to public telephony, provided that the need for this
service to remain part of the universal service can be demonstrated on the basis of national circumstances and
is limited to where this need exists (e.g. airports, stations, hospitals).

There are no longer specific QoS-Quality of Service obligations related to the provision of the universal service.
Member States can also choose the financing methods for costs relating to the universal service: public and/or
sectoral.

TIM Group
BEREC Regulation

The 2018/1971 Regulation revises the operating rules for the Body of European Regulators for Electronic
Communications (BEREC) and the tasks assigned to it. In particular, these include:

™ assisting and advising the Commission, at its request, in relation to drafting legislative proposals in the field
of electronic communications, including any proposals to amend the Regulation or Code;

™ preparing guidelines for the implementation of the Code (e.g. geographic mapping of access networks, Very
High Capacity Networks +VHCN and co-investment, symmetric obligations);

™ the BEREC and Commission double-lock veto on decisions relating to the imposition of symmetric
obligations beyond the first distribution or concentration point and non-imposition of obligations in the
presence of binding commitments on co-investment in VHCN (introduced in the Code).

The Regulation does not amend the governance of BEREC: with continued provision for BEREC and the BEREC
Office, the latter being an EU agency with legal personality.

Intra-EU international communications regulation

The BEREC regulation also introduces caps for intra-EU international calls and SMSes only for fixed-line and
mobile consumer customers.

The caps for intra-EU international calls and SMSes were applied from May 15, 2019, for a duration of 5 years, so
until May 14, 2024:

= 19 euro cents/min (+VAT) for international intra-EU calls;
™ 6 euro cents/SMS (+VAT) for intra-EU international SMSes.

Wholesale fixed-line markets

Fixed network access market analysis

The final provision published on August 8, 2019 defines the obligations and economic conditions for wholesale
access services for the period 2018-2021.
The main decisions relate to:

= repeal of TIM's qualification as an operator with Significant Market Power (SPM) in the access market - and,
consequently, repeal of all ex ante regulatory obligations - in the municipality of Milan and confirmation of
SPM operator qualification for the rest of the National territory;

= repeal of the obligation to guide the cost of bitstream copper and fiber service prices in 26 municipalities
considered "contestable" (list to be updated annually); the possibility to apply, in the same municipalities,
different VULA prices from the national average value set by the Authority starting from 2021, if certain
conditions to be defined by the Authority are met, through a specific procedure put in place with resolution
no. 481/19/CONS published on February 4, 2020;

=™ Wholesale access rates for copper and fiber for 2018 equal to those of 2017, unless there is a limited
reduction in the VULA FTTC fee;

™ gradual increase in the full unbundling price (ULL) and bitstream price on copper in the 2019-2021 period;
™ sub loop unbundling (SLU) price stability in the 2019-2021 period;

= gradual decrease in fiber access prices (VULA FTTC and FTTH) and price differentiation of the bandwidth,
starting in 2021, depending on whether the access line is on a copper or NGA network;

™ repeal of the current prior AGCom notification obligations and verification of ex ante "replicability" for
flagship offers with speeds greater than or equal to 100 Mbit/s and, in other cases, reduction of prior
notification period from 30 to 20 days;

= definition of the process and timing for the decommissioning of TIM exchanges;

Infratel Tenders for the subsidizing of Ultra-broadband networks

At the end of December 2018, the third and final call for coverage of ultrabroadband "white areas" not covered
by the private operator plans was also assigned to Open Fiber.

The related Concessions for the Calabria, Puglia and Sardinia regions was signed on April 2, 2019.

Infratel launched a new consultation on UltraBroadBand coverage plans to get an up-to-date picture of gray and
black area coverage on January 18, 2019, following previous consultations.

Report on Operations of the Main changes in the regulatory framework | 33
TIM Group
The results of the consultation were published on May 15, 2019. Infratel held that further technical insight was
necessary and will set up a technical working group with operators to investigate the technological evolution of
FWA and VDSL solutions capable of reaching speeds in excess of 100 Mbit/s.

This monitoring activity will be used to allow the Italian government to assess the launch of public activities to
promote a step change in the UltraBroadBand coverage of "gray" areas not covered at 100 Mbit/s.

To prevent any overlap with ongoing private activities and, at the same time, to guarantee the widest coverage
across Italy, Infratel will ask operators to enter into a contract on the declared coverage commitments before
each notification of public activities.

At the meeting of the Ultra-Broadband Committee (COBUL) of July 17, 2019, the Government approved the
launch of the second phase of the Ultra-Wide Band Plan (BUL) to take action in Italy's gray areas and support
the demand for ultra-fast services through special vouchers for consumer, business and public administration
customer connectivity. The operating procedures for the planned activities will be defined by COBUL in
consultation with MiSE/Infratel and submitted to the European Commission. On December 19, 2019, COBUL
decided to revive the Government activity on the UBB plan and to convene once a month to monitor the progress
of the process for defining measures for the infrastructure side and demand incentives.

At the COBUL meeting of January 23, 2020, a program document was approved which provides for the measures
to be issued for the launch of a new tender for gray areas and the adoption of application vouchers by the end
of summer 2020.

Wholesale mobile network markets

Mobile termination market analysis

On January 22, 2019, AGCom published its final decision on mobile network termination market analysis
(resolution no. 599/18/CONS). In particular, AGCom established symmetric tariffs for all MNO and full MVNO
operators for the period 2018-2021 (0.98 euro cents in 2018, 0.90 euro cents in 2019, 0.76 euro cents in 2020, 0.67
euro cents in 2021) and confirmed the absence of an obligation to check the termination prices for calls
originating outside the European Economic Area (EEA); however, SMP operators cannot adopt termination rates
that are higher than those applied to Italian operators by operators in non-EEA countries where rates are
regulated.

Retail fixed-line markets

Universal Service

Net cost

Following ruling no. 4616/2015, published on October 2, 2015, in which the Council of State canceled decision no.
1/08/CIR of AGCom on the retroactive application of the new methodological criteria for calculating the net cos
of the universal service (USO) relating to the 2004-2007 years, the Authority began the public consultation of the
net cost of the total years 2004-2007 with resolution 89/18/CIR, published on July 3, 2018, and subsequent
resolution no. 62/19/CIR, published on May 7, 2019. On September 11, 2019, the Authority published the fina
resolution concerning the Net Cost of Use for 2004-2007 (resolution no. 103/19/CIR) in which it recognized the
existence of an unfair charge for TIM of a total of 113.4 million euros to be shared between all fixed-line and
mobile operators. The share payable by the OAOs amounts to approximately 26.6 million euros, calculated net
of installments already paid by the same operators, following the 2004 and 2005 procedures approved "illo
tempore". In relation to past disputes, still “in progress” to date, following ruling no. 3388/15 of the Council o
State, published on July 7, 2015, on September 11, 2019, the Authority launched the public consultation procedure
(resolution no. 102/19/CIR) for an in-depth fixed-mobile substitutability analysis, in line with the path outlined for
the 2004-2007 years. In this context, ruling no. 6881 of October 8, 2019, in which the Council of State authorized
the return of the shares paid by Vodafone to TIM, for the contested years (1999-2000 and 2002-2003). In light of
the above-mentioned Council of State ruling, which completely reversed the Lazio TAR rulings no. 6458, 6459,
6461 and 6463 of May 23, 2018, in execution of which the public consultation pursuant to resolution no.
102/19/CIR was started, the Authority revoked the aforementioned resolution with decision 190/19/CIR.

On December 4, 2019, AGCom began certification activities for the Net Cost 2010, to be carried out by the BDO
S.p.A. company. The activities will be completed at the end of March of the current year. Activities will then begin
to review the net cost annuities for 2011, 2012 and 2013.

In relation to the universal service quality objectives, in 2019, AGCom fined TIM twice, each time for an amount
equal to 58,000 euros. Both fines were for the failure to reach, in different years, targets relating to the "Average
operator response time to incoming calls". The first of the two fines relates to 2017 for a non-compliance of 17"
(identified by AGCom with resolution 103/19/CONS: The actual figures 87" vs. target of 70"). The second fine
relates to the following year (2018) and in this case the non-compliance was 24" (identified by AGCom with
resolution 438/19/CONS: The actual figures 94" vs. target of 70").

For the resolution 103/19/CONS only, due to the failure to comply with some formal requirements, on June 18,
2019 TIM filed an appeal for cancellation before the Lazio TAR.

Guidelines for voluntary withdrawal
With resolution no. 487/18/CONS, the Authority regulated the ways operators must manage dissolution and
transfer methods for user contracts.

Report on Operations of the Main changes in the regulatory framework | 34
TIM Group
TIM challenged the resolution regarding the provisions that limit the right to fully recover the costs in case of
withdrawal (discounts from promotions, product installments). As of February 2020, proceedings are still
pending.

Freedom to choose Modems

With resolution no. 348/18/CONS, the Authority ratified the principle of user freedom to choose modems for
Internet access.

TIM challenged the resolution in relation to the transitional provisions for customers who have an internet offer
combined with a modem for a fee (sale and rental) in the months preceding the entry into force of resolution
no. 348/18/CONS (December 1, 2018). Following the Council of State order at the end of 2018, which suspended
the transitional provisions pending a hearing being set in the Lazio TAR, and which asked for the hearing set for
October to be brought forward, on January 29, 2019, the Lazio TAR confirmed the public hearing, already set for
October 23, 2019. On January 28, 2020, the TAR rejected TIM's appeal. Assessments are underway of the effects
of the ruling and any possible appeal.

Authority fees

AGCom contribution fee

In March 2019, TIM conditionally paid an amount of 18.3 million euros for the 2019 AGCom contribution fee. The
amount was calculated by applying a rate of 1.3/1000 to the revenues posted in the Company’s 2017 Financial
Statements, as required by the guidelines set out in AGCom Decision no. 527/18/CONS.

Privacy and personal data protection

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Legislative Decree 101/2018

On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 - “GDPR”) came into
force.

Furthermore, on September 19, 2018, Legislative Decree no. 101 of August 10, 2018 entered into force, which
brought the Code regarding the protection of personal data (Legislative Decree June 30, 2003, no. 196) in line
with the provisions of the GDPR - EU Regulation 2016/679.

To ensure compliance of personal data processing with the GDPR within Group companies, TIM has carried out
the activities provided in the adaptation plan.

Of the main changes, the following is noted:

= the appointment of a Data Protection Officer and establishment of related contact points for individuals
with questions relating to the processing of their personal data;

™ the review of the "System of rules for the application of legislation on personal data protection in the Telecom
Italia Group" was completed in 2018 to bring TIM in line with the provisions of the GDPR, and revision of the
same policy was completed for Group companies September 2019, as a consequence of the entry into force
of Legislative Decree August 10, 2018, no. 101;

™ the updating of the numerous policy notice texts on personal data processing, provided by TIM and the other
Group companies to different types of Data Subjects (e.g. customers, employees, visitors).

A specific training project was put in place to raise awareness in the various company departments and illustrate

the policies and procedures issued for applying the legislation on personal data processing. This training was

provided during 2019.

Extension of the Golden Power rule to 5G technology services

Law Decree Law March 25, 2019, no. 22 and Law Decree July 11, 2019, no. 64

The Law Decree of March 25, 2019, no. 22 amends the Law Decree March 15, 2012, no. 21, converted, with

amendments, by Law May 11, 2012, no. 56 and classifies 5G development as a strategic activity in relation to

defence and national security, which requires stricter controls.

In particular, the following are subject to special powers:

a) the agreement of contracts or agreements for the purchase of goods or services relating to the design,
construction, maintenance and management of 5G service networks;

b) the acquisition of high-tech components necessary for implementation or management;

c) factors indicating the existence of vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity and security of
networks and the data sent on them.

In particular, the agreement of contracts and acquisition of high intensity components from subjects outside the

European Union, carry an obligation to notify the Prime Minister to allow a timely exercise of the veto power.

Failure to comply with this notification obligation carries a pecuniary administrative fine equal to twice the value

of the transaction and in any event not less than 1 percent of the turnover of the last financial year.

The Law Decree also provides for the Prime Minister to adopt a decree (DPCM) to identify measures to simplify

the notification methods.

In relation to this, on June 27, 2019, the Government launched a public consultation, for the eventual adoption

of the Prime Ministerial Decree, to take contributions from interested parties on the following issues:

a) identification of simplified notification methods, possibly differentiated (for example, based on activity
performed, services offered or type of infrastructure concerned);

Report on Operations of the Main changes in the regulatory framework | 35
TIM Group
b) definition of simplified procedures and terms for investigations, in relation to specific circumstances.
Contributions were submitted in July 2019.

On July 11, 2019, Law Decree no. 64, which introduced further changes to the provisions of Law Decree March 15,
2012 no. 21, was converted, with amendments, by the Law of May 11, 2012, no. 56.

In relation to 5G in particular, the new Decree introduces the obligation to notify the Prime Minister, making full
disclosure within ten days of the finalization of a contract or agreement concerning the purchase of goods or
services relating to the design, construction, maintenance and management of 5G networks or the acquisition
of high-tech components for the aforementioned construction or management, when agreed with subjects
outside the European Union, to allow the possible exercise of the veto power or the imposition of specific
requirements or conditions.

The Prime Minister will communicate any possible veto or the imposition of specific requirements or conditions
within forty-five days of notification.

Due to the failure to convert the aforementioned Law Decree no. 64 into law, the Golden Power regulations (both
general and 5G specific) have been further integrated by the provisions of the Law Decree of September 21, 2019,
no. 105, converted with the Law of November 18, 2019, no. 133, containing "Urgent provisions on the cybernetic
national security perimeter". In particular, it provides that the obligations aimed at ensuring cyber security also
apply to companies subject to 5G specific notification obligations. Furthermore, the terms for the assessment of
the possible exercise of special powers by the Government have been extended.

BRAZIL

Revision of the model for the provision of telecommunications services

n April 2016, the working group composed of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and
Communications (MCTIC) and Anatel published its final report with a “diagnosis” on the telecommunications
industry and proposed guidelines for the revision of the Brazilian regulatory model. A bill (PLC 79/2016) was then
presented to the National Congress of Brazil to propose amendments to the General Telecommunications Law.
Law 13.879 was approved in 2019 and entered into force on October 4, establishing a new regulatory environment
for the regulation of telecommunications in Brazil. This is the most significant change in 20 years.

The new telecommunications framework allows fixed-line licensees to adapt their contracts from a concession
scheme to an authorization scheme. This transition from concession to authorization must be requested by the
icensee and requires the approval of the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel). In return,
icensees must, among other conditions, make a commitment to investment in expanding fixed broadband
telephony services to areas with no adequate competition for these services, in order to minimize inadequacies
and inequalities between areas of Brazil.

The change also affects the roles for authorizing the use of radio frequencies, establishing subsequent renewals
currently limited to only one) and allows the exchange of radio frequencies between operators (secondary
spectrum market). In the coming months, the procedures for adapting the concession to the authorization
regime and defining the criteria for calculating investment commitments will continue to be regulated by the
Federal Government and Anatel.

Another series of important rules was established by Decree 9612/2018 ("Connectivity Plan"), with a series of
guidelines for the adaptation of conduct terms, the onerous concession of spectrum authorization and
regulatory acts in general, including: (i) expansion of high capacity telecommunications transport networks; (ii)
increased coverage of mobile broadband access networks; and (iii) broadening the coverage of fixed broadband
access network in areas with no Internet access through this type of infrastructure. This Decree also establishes
that the network resulting from the commitments must be shared from the moment it enters into service, except
where there is adequate competition in the relative reference market.

In relation to the deadlines for the development of pipelines not compliant with current regulations,
authorizations for user licenses to radio frequencies, and the introduction of other statutory provisions generally,
planned investments (as identified by Anatel and approved by the MCTIC) will focus primarily on the expansion
of mobile and fixed-line broadband networks and on specific areas of the country. TLC networks built under the
investment plan will have shared access.

Revision of Competition Rules

In November 2012, the Brazilian regulator Anatel introduced instruments for the market analysis, the
identification of operators with significant market power (SMP) and the consequent imposition of ex-ante
obligations (Plano Geral de Metas de Competicdo - PGMC).

Anatel has established a number of asymmetrical obligations on all markets for operators with a Significant
Market Power (SMP).

In July 2018, Anatel published the new PGMC revising some points and defining two new markets: (i)
interconnection for mobile services; and (ii) high capacity data transmission.

TIM Brasil has been identified as the SMP operator for: (i) mobile network terminals; (ii) national roaming; and
(iii) high capacity data transport (in five municipalities).

Report on Operations of the Main changes in the regulatory framework | 36
TIM Group
The measures applied to the SMP operator in these markets include the obligation for non-SMP operators to
offer national roaming services. The obligation for access to the copper network has been maintained (e.g. leased
lines, bitstream and full unbundling) was maintained.

Since 2016, fixed interconnection rates have been based on a cost-oriented approach. In December 2018, Anatel
published the laws that establish the MTR that will be valid fromm 2020 to 2023.

Revision of the Service Quality Regulation

In December 2019, Anatel approved the new Telecommunication Services Quality Regulation (RQUAL), based on
a reactive approach to standards. In this new model, quality is measured on the basis of three indicators - a
Service Quality Index, a Perceived Quality Index and a User Complaints Index - and operators are classified into
five categories (A to E). Based on the standards' responsive approach, Anatel will be able to take measures based
on specific cases, including consumer compensation, the adoption of an action plan or the application of
precautionary measures to ensure quality standard improvements.

The new regulation is scheduled to enter into force in 2021; until Anatel sets up the Working Group, operators
and the support body for quality assurance (ESAQ) will define the objectives, criteria and reference values and
Anatel will monitor the indicators that guarantee analogy with the new ones introduced in the new RQUAL. The
criteria and reference values will be established in the next 12 months by the Working Group.

700 MHz and Analog TV switch off

In September 2014, TIM won the tender for the award of the 700 MHz (4G/LTE) band frequencies, for a price of
17 billion reais, and with additional commitments of 1.2 billion reais (in four annual installments, adjusted for
inflation) as a contribution to the consortium established by the tender (“EAD”) for all the operators (TIM, Algar,
Claro and Vivo) awarded the contract for managing the freeing up of the 700 MHz band through the switch off
of analog TV, the redistribution of channels and the clean-up of interference. To that end, the first payment (370
million reais) was made in April 2015 and another two payments (for a total of 860 million reais) were both made
in January 2017, while the final installment (142 million reais) was duly paid in January 2018.

The spectrum for mobile traffic was released in 2016, and in June 2019 the availability for all municipalities was
guaranteed, meaning that the entire Brazilian population can be covered by 700 MHz LTE.

"Marco Civil da Internet" and Network Neutrality

The “Marco Civil da Internet” (MCI), approved in April 2014 by Brazilian Law no. 12,965/2014, defined network
neutrality as the “duty to treat different data packages in the same way, without distinction based on content,
origin and destination, service, terminal or application”. On May 11, 2016, Brazilian Presidential Decree no.
8,771/2016 was published, which regulates exceptions to the principle of net neutrality, set out in article 9 of the
mentioned law.

In August 2017, the oversight board (“GS”) of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) handed
down a decision in favor of Brazil’s mobile TLC providers, which excluded the imposition of fines in relation to a
preliminary investigation into alleged unfair competition in “zero rating” offers and promotions on Internet data
consumption. The oversight board heard the depositions of various parties, including the Ministry of Science,
Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) and Anatel, and concluded that Internet business models
should not be banned ex-ante, but instead should be monitored comprehensively to prevent any cases of unfair
competition.

Strategic Digital Transformation and the Internet of Things

In March 2018, the E-Digital Decree 9319/2018 was published, it identified about 100 strategic actions to
encourage competition and the country's level of online productivity, as well as to increase connectivity and
digital inclusion levels. These actions aim to address the digital economy's main strategic issues, including
connectivity infrastructure, data use and protection, the Internet of Things and cybersecurity.

The Decree on the National Plan for the Internet of Things (Decree 9854/2019) was published in June 2019, to
regulate and promote this technology in Brazil. The Decree describes the Internet of Things (loT) as the
"infrastructure integrating the value-added services offer with the ability to physically or virtually connect things
with devices based on existing information and communication technology and their evolution, through
interoperability". The Decree lists the following topics, defining them as necessary to further support the National
Plan for the Internet of Things: (i) science, technology and innovation; (ii) international integration; (iii) education
and professional training; (iv) connectivity and interoperability infrastructure; (v) regulation, security and privacy;
(vi) economic feasibility.

Data protection

On August 14, 2018, the Brazilian President promulgated the General Data Protection Law (Law 13.709/2018).
The new law, as promulgated by the President, is closer to the GDPR, including significant extra-territorial
application and considerable fines of up to 2% of the Company's global turnover of the previous financial year.
In December 2018, Provisional Measure 869/2018 passed by the former President amended Law 13.709 to create
the National Data Protection Authority (ANPD), within the structure of the Presidency of the Republic, which
implies greater control by the State and, among other topics, extending the entry into force of the Law to 24
months (August 2020). By this date (August 2020) all legal entities will be required to adapt their data processing
activities to the new rules.

In July 2019, the Provisional Measure 869/2018 was converted into Law 13.853, which provides for the ANPD as a
body to remain part of the federal public administration in the executive branch.

COMPETITION

DOMESTIC

The market

During 2019, the Italian TLC market continued to contract in value due to strong competition.

The development of Broadband and UltraBroadBand was the main factor of market evolution. The greater
availability of UltraBroadBand will allow operators to develop convergent offers that combine Media &
Entertainment, IT and Digital services with TLC services. The offer of these services will further boost adoption
by broadband customers.

The Italian telecommunications market remains highly competitive, with the greatest impact of market
dynamics on voice and data connectivity services. Furthermore, in the new digital world, telecommunications
operators have to deal with Over The Top - OTT and device manufacturers with completely different competitive
assets and logic.

The traditional business models of the various market players are, therefore, changing over time to exploit new
opportunities and meet the challenges posed by the new entrants:

= in the Media & Entertainment sector, with the growing importance of the internet as a complementary
distribution platform. In 2019, the Italian television market saw the further development of OTT on demand
video services (VOD and SVOD), combined with the growing diffusion of OTT services that include linear
video content. The central role of the broadband network in these new use modes sees OTT players,
telecommunications operators and Consumer Electronics manufacturers take on an increasingly important
role;

= in the Information and Communication Technology market, where, although there was overall growth in
2019, the traditional fixed-line and mobile TLC component contracted, in favor of IT components related to
digital transformation, especially for large companies, for example with the adoption of Cloud solutions for
their technological infrastructures. This evolution and transformation is set to continue with the expansion
of the country's 5G network coverage. In this sector, telecommunications operators have been
strengthened, including through partnerships, to take advantage of the growth that, in the next few years,
will be driven by the digitalization of SMEs and regulatory changes, such as the increasingly stringent rules
relating to IT security;

™ Consumer Electronics manufacturers are developing services that can be accessed through the Internet by
leveraging handset ownership and user experience management, breaking the relationship between
customers and TLC providers.

With regard to the current positioning of telecommunications providers in converging markets, on the other
hand, as partially described above, the following is taking place with different levels of progress:

=~ development of new Media & Entertainment services (TV, Music, Gaming) and new Digital services (Smart
Home, Digital Advertising, Mobile Payment-Digital Identity);

= development of Innovative Services in the IT market, particularly Cloud services.

After the frequencies were awarded in 2018, 2019 was characterized by the progressive deployment of the 5G
network and service activation by TIM and Vodafone in main cities with the commercial launch of specific tariff
plans.

After the initial launch, operators are moving to take advantage of the various opportunities in new vertical

markets (e.g. energy & utilities, smart cities, smart manufacturing, automotive, eHealth) and provide new
services, enable new production processes and increase efficiency in optimized product management.

Competition in Fixed-line Telecommunications

The fixed-line telecommunications market has continued to see a decline in access and voice revenues, while
broadband and ultra-broadband revenues have shown growth. In recent years, service providers have
concentrated mainly on expanding the penetration of broadband and ultra-broadband services and defending
Voice revenues by introducing bundled voice, broadband and service deals in a highly competitive environment
with consequent pricing pressure.

The market scenario involves significant infrastructural activities, by TIM and other parties, firstly Open Fiber (a
company controlled by ENEL and CDP), Infratel (a company belonging to the Ministry of Economic Development)

Report on Operations of the Competition | 39
TIM Group
and Fastweb who have presented and are still working on extensive development plans for their fiber optic
telecommunications networks in many areas of the country.

For major cities, Open Fiber announced a separate plan for the development of Fiber to the Home (FTTH)
connections in 271 large Italian towns for the start of 2023, reaching around 9.6 million homes through an
investment of 3.8 billion euros.

After obtaining 3.5 billion euros of funding in July 2018, the development of the Open Fiber network was stepped
up considerably, opening up to 129 Italian towns (as of January 2020), including many major Italian cities, such
as Milan, Turin and Bologna, previously cabled by "Metroweb" (acquired in December 2016) had previously
expanded, besides other cities such as Bari, Cagliari, Catania, Naples, Padova, Perugia, Venice, Genoa, Palermo
and Florence, and other smaller towns that are mainly satellite areas of Milan, Turin and Bologna. It also
announced the marketing of its services in a district of Rome in August 2019.

According to press reports, Open Fiber has signed agreements with TIM's main competitors on the
telecommunications retail market to provide its UltraBroadBand (UBB) services, where available.

In relation to market failure areas, the so-called white areas in the C and D clusters of the government’s
UltraBroadband Plan, Infratel took direct action in the development of the UBB network in a number of Italian
municipalities ("Infratel direct intervention areas") and held three public calls for tenders over the last three years
for the development of a UBB network to deliver services to around 7,500 municipalities across 19 regions:

= In the first call for tenders Open Fiber was awarded all five lots in the 6 regions involved (Lombardy, Emilia-
Romagna, Veneto, Tuscany, Abruzzo and Molise) for around 3,000 municipalities;

™ inthe second call for tenders, Open Fiber won all six of the lots offered in the ten regions involved (Piedmont,
Valle d'Aosta, Liguria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Marche, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Basilicata and Sicily) plus the
Autonomous Province of Trento, covering around 3,700 municipalities;

= inthe third call for tenders, Open Fiber won all three lots in the three regions involved (Apulia, Calabria and
Sardinia) covering around 880 municipalities.

n December 2019, there were nearly 2,811 work sites open for the first two Infratel/Open Fiber contracts, of which
1,934 for FTTH fiber optic connections and 877 for wireless connections (FWA), however, there have been
significant delays in the marketing of services in the areas where work has been carried out.

Fastweb is pursuing its relevant UBB development plan along two main lines: its partnership with TIM in Flash
Fiber and the FTTH coverage of 29 main Italian cities and development of its own FTTC network including with
the acquisition of infrastructure and services, such as the Sub Loop, from TIM. In May 2019, it announced that it
had signed an agreement with Open Fiber to use OF-installed FTTH connections in areas not covered by
proprietary infrastructure as well as white areas.

Therefore the development of alternative subject Plans - both in major Italian cities and market failure areas -
will drive a significant shift in infrastructure competition, with the development of various competitive dynamics
depending on the presence and reach of available ultrabroadband infrastructure:

- areas with FTTH networks possibly overlapping TIM FTTC networks or those of OLOs with the use of TIM
infrastructural services (Sub Loop, etc.);

- areas with only one FTTH network overlapping TIM FTTC networks or those of OLOs with the use of TIM
infrastructural services (Sub Loop, etc.);

- areas with FTTH networks overlapping ADSL networks belonging to TIM or OLOs using TIM services;

- areas with FTTC networks overlapping ADSL networks belonging to TIM or OLOs using TIM services;.

Competition in the Italian fixed-line telecommunications market is also characterized by the presence of other
service providers besides TIM, such as Wind-Tre, Fastweb, Vodafone, and Tiscali, which have business models
focused on different segments of the market.

At the end of 2019, fixed accesses in Italy were estimated to be around 19.5 million (including OLO Infrastructured
and FWA-Fixed Wireless Accesses) down slightly on the previous year. Competition in the access market led to
a gradual reduction in TIM's market share.

As concerns the broadband market, at December 31, 2019, the number of fixed-line broadband customers in
Italy (including both broadband and Ultra-broadband customers) is estimated to have reached a penetration
rate of approximately 90% of all fixed-line accesses. The spread of broadband continues to be driven by the
penetration of enabled devices (such as Smart TVs, Smart Speaker, connected devices), but also by growing
demand for fast connections and access to new over-IP services that are becoming increasingly widespread
(Media & Entertainment, IT and Digital services).

Report on Operations of the Competition | 40
TIM Group
Competition in Mobile Telecommunications

The mobile market has continued to see the rationalization of second and third SIM cards for human
communications and growth of SIM cards for machine to machine (M2M) communications.

Alongside innovative services that have already caught on and are under full-scale development, as in the case
of mobile apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of mobile broadband,
with major potential for growth in the medium term, such as the Internet of Things and mobile payment.

The competitive scenario of the Italian mobile telecommunications market in 2019 continues to be characterized
by the particularly aggressive price and data volume offering of Illiad, which has continued to win over customers
and consequently gained a market share to the detriment of other infrastructured operators, mainly WindTre
and Vodafone, while TIM has shown a greater resilience, thanks also to the contribution from the second brand,
Kena Mobile. MVOs (mobile virtual operators) also grew at the expense of infrastructure operators; among these,
Poste Mobile is the most important player.

The foregoing has continued to lead to a drop in service spending, even though competitive pressure on tariffs is
easing with the main mobile operators tending to increase the prices of bundle offers in the face of the increase

The macroeconomic trends of the last quarter of 2019 confirm the expected recovery scenario for 2020, although
forecasts for 2019 were gradually reduced during the year up to the third quarter, mainly due to the political uncertainties
generated by the pension reforms. Thus, the main scenario is still a slow economic recovery scenario, after a severe
recession notably during 2015-16 period. Unemployment has been falling slowly, while inflation returned to a more
contained level (below 4.5% for 2019).
Although there is still some political uncertainty, especially in relation the new government's ability to implement some
liberal economic programs such as administrative and fiscal reform, the market has taken note of the initial results
presented so far, considering them favorable for businesses, in the wake of the recent increases on the Brazilian stock
market (Ibovespa +32% in 2019).
Despite the improvement in financial performance indicators, economic conditions are still difficult, with the budget
deficit and increasing debts (for central governments, federal states and municipalities) carrying a risk that can only be
managed with more structural reform, for which Congress's approval is needed. The current government has recognized
the need to introduce reforms and considers them a top priority for 2020, in addition to the privatization of some
companies (such as Eletrobras, Telebras, Poste, DataPrev) to allow constant growth of the economy in the coming years
and to improve infrastructure investment.

The mobile telecommunications sector has seen some rationality prevail in the market and in competition, with service
providers basing their offers on the characteristics and service range of their commercial offers, rather than pursuing
aggressive pricing policies, especially for the first half of 2018.

nthe Prepaid segment, the main objective of market players has been to raise the frequency percentage for the use of
services by leveraging the ongoing SIM card consolidation process in the market, by encouraging migration to weekly
(and monthly) plans or hybrid plans (Controle postpaid) by offering a range of bundled service packages on the basis of
the different needs of customers (unlimited voice calls or data packages). This strategy aims to improve the customer
base mix by ensuring greater stability (and a reduction in the leaving rate) and dynamic growth of ARPU. The prepaid
base registered a drop of 7.6% compared to the previous year

n the postpaid mobile segment, growth in the customer base was driven primarily by the hybrid Controle segment (in
particular by the migration of Prepaid customers), even though “pure” Postpaid lines also registered a certain growth
based on offer segmentation strategies that introduce distinctions in the use of data services (for example the unlimited
use of data for specific apps, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, etc.), as part of a “More for More” sales policy that
is bringing greater price stability and effectively repositioning the customer base towards higher value deals (voice +data
+content). The postpaid base registered growth of 6.1% compared to the previous year.

Service quality is still an element of differentiation. Telecommunication providers that have invested more in the
development of 4G networks (coverage and capacity) and in the improvement of processes shaping customers’
experience will have a greater ability to apply premium prices, as customers raise their expectations and place growing
importance on the quality of data services and higher value content. The three main operators already provide 4G
coverage for over 90% of the Brazilian urban population (up to December 2019, latest data available) and guarantee a
higher than 77% time availability of 4G (according to the Opensignal report of January 2020).

The fixed broadband market recorded a growth of 4.3% on an annual basis mainly driven by smaller market operators
(+25.7% on an annual basis), which tend to offer higher download speeds and/or presence in areas where incumbent
operators have infrastructure limitations. As a result, traditional incumbent operators are suffering heavy losses in their
customer base. Penetration rates across the population are still quite low (approximately 47% of houses) when
compared to several other countries, which means there are good opportunities for medium-term growth, underpinned
by the improving macroeconomic situation.

In this context, since 2017, TIM adopted a business strategy for TIM Live to leverage its fiber network infrastructure,
offering ultra broadband Internet services, through FTTC and notably FTTH, not only in some of the largest cities of
Brazil, but also in cities where opportunities arise for such high-quality service. TIM Live therefore increased its coverage
reaching 23 cities before the end of 2019, and plans to extend it further in the coming years. At the end of 2019, TIM Live

had a customer base of 566,000 users (an increase of 21.1% on an annual basis). For smaller cities, TIM has launched its
WTTx service, which delivers broadband services through the LTE mobile network, leveraging TIM’s leading 4G coverage
to address increasing demand for residential broadband, especially in areas with poor fixed infrastructure by local

incumbent.

In particular:

™ the Domestic Business Unit reported expenditures equal to 2,912 million euros (5,518 million euros in 2018).
In organic terms and net of the acquisition in 2018 of the rights of use for 5G frequencies in Italy (2,399 million
euros) the reduction is equal to -206 million euros compared to the previous year owing to the continuous
improvement of the spending conditions and terms and to the coverage levels already achieved on the fixed
and mobile access components;

™ in 2019, the Brazil Business Unit recorded Capex of 872 million euros, down 18 million euros compared to
2018 (890 million euros). Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates (-22 million euros), capex grew
by 4 million euros, mainly to strengthen the mobile ultrabroadband infrastructure and the development of
the fixed broadband business of TIM Live.

Change in net operating working capital

In comparable terms, the change in Net operating working capital for 2019 reflects an absorption of 598 million
euros (positive change of 1,194 million euros in 2018). In particular, "Other changes in operating
receivables/payables" (-664 million euros) were mainly related to the Brazil Business Unit's higher operating
receivables following the favorable outcome of tax disputes. The change in 2018 was mainly related to the higher
operating payables (+1,922 million euros) following the acquisition of user rights for mobile phone frequencies
(5G) in Italy.

Change in provisions for employee benefits

In the 2019, the change amounted to -246 million euro (-208 million euro in 2018) and mainly refers to uses for
staff leaving the company related to the redundancy plans already allocated in previous years, as well as to the
revised estimate and start date for staff leaving the Parent scheduled for the 2020 financial year (also in
accordance with the application of article 4 of the Law of June 28, 2012, no. 92, as last defined in the union
agreement of February 26, 2019) and the expenses recognized as a result of the agreements signed with the
trade unions by Olivetti, H.R. Services and Telecom Italia Sparkle in accordance with article 4 of June 28, 2012,
no. 92.

Sale of investments and other disposals flow

Was positive for 160 million euros and mainly refers to the sale of Persidera S.p.A., which took place on December
2, 2019, with a 142 million euros collection, as well as to other sales of equity investments (7 million euros) and
to disposals of non-current assets taking place within the normal operating cycle (7 million euros).

In 2018, the overall flow was positive for 18 million euros.

Share capital increases/reimbursements, including incidental costs

These totaled 10 million euros in 2019 and essentially consisted of contributions from an external shareholder of
the Group for new capital issued by a subsidiary (22 million euros in 2018).

Increase in finance leasing contracts

In 2019, this item amounted to 1,140 million euros.

On the same accounting basis, they amounted to 168 million euros (70 million euros in 2018) mainly attributable
to TIM S.p.A. and the Brazil Business Unit and relate to renegotiations and adjustments of finance lease contracts
already existing at December 31, 2018 valued according to IAS 17.

Increases in finance lease contracts include the higher value of user rights entered following new lease contracts
payables, increase of lease payments and renegotiations of existing contracts.

For further details, see the Note "Rights of use assets" of the Consolidated financial statements at December 31,
2019 of the TIM Group.

Financial expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating
requirements flow

The item, in comparable terms, shows a net requirement for a total of 1,399 million euros and mainly includes
disbursements relating to the components of financial income and expense as well as the payment of income
tax expenses and the change in non-operating receivables and payables.

Sales of receivables to factoring companies

It should be noted that sales without recourse of trade receivables to factoring companies completed during
2019 resulted in a positive effect on the adjusted net financial debt at December 31, 2019 amounting to 1,958
million euros (2,004 million euros at December 31, 2018).

The financial risk management policies of the TIM Group are aimed at minimizing market risks, fully hedging
exchange rate risk, and optimizing interest rate exposure through appropriate diversification of the portfolio,
which is also achieved by using carefully selected derivative financial instruments. Such instruments, it should
be stressed, are not used for speculative purposes and all have an underlying, which is hedged.

In addition, to determine its exposure to interest rates, the Group sets an optimum composition for the fixed-
rate and variable-rate debt structure and uses derivative financial instruments to achieve that composition.
Taking into account the Group's operating activities, the optimum mix of medium/long-term non-current
financial liabilities has been established, on the basis of the nominal amount, at a range of 65%-75% for the
fixed-rate component and 25%-35% for the variable-rate component.

In managing market risks, the Group has adopted Guidelines for the "Management and control of financial risk"
and mainly uses IRS and CCIRS derivative financial instruments.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual
indicator (renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure called “Adjusted net
financial debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial markets. Given that some

Report on Operations of the Consolidated Financial Position and Cash Flows Performance | 48
TIM Group
components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the exchange and interest rate
for contractual flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result in actual
monetary settlement, the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these purely accounting and non-monetary
effects (including the effects of IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement) from the measurement of derivatives and
related financial assets/liabilities.

For further details, see the "Alternative performance indicators" chapter.

Comparable adjusted net financial debt posted a reduction of 1,431 million euros compared to year-end 2018,
and amounted to 23,839 million euros (25,270 million euros at December 31, 2018) and 892 million euros
compared to June 30, 2019 (24,731 million euros). The solid generation of operating cash flows, achieved by
continuously reducing costs and optimizing working capital, has allowed for a large debt reduction.

To better understand the report, following the application of the new IFRS 16 standard, the various methods of
representing the Net Financial Debt are explained in the following table (as regards the figures at 1/1/2019 the
values resulting from adoption of IFRS 16 were implemented on the accounting data at 12/31/2018):

Adjusted net financial debt - After Lease 21,893 23,322 (1,429)

The net financial debt carrying amount at December 31, 2019 amounted to 28,246 million euros and reflects the
impact of the application of the new accounting standard IFRS 16 (Leases).

Reported adjusted net financial debt (including IFRS 16) amounted to 27,668 million euros at December 31, 2019
and particularly reflects the 3,553 million euros increase emerging from the application of the new IFRS 16
(Leases) as of January 1, 2019 following which the lease payments are no longer recognized as costs for
Acquisition of goods and services, but a financial liability must be recognized in the statement of financial
position, represented by the current value of the future payments.

Adjusted Net Financial Debt - After Lease (net of all leases, as specified in the detailed section “After lease
indicators”), a metric adopted by the main European peers, was 21,893 million euros at December 31, 2019.

INWIT's acquisition of the minority stake in VOD Towers, the distribution of an extraordinary dividend, as well as
to refinance part of INWIT's existing debt and meet its cash flow needs.

Maturities of financial liabilities and average cost of debt

The average maturity of non-current financial liabilities (including the current portion of medium/long-term
financial liabilities due within 12 months) was 8.26 years.

The average cost of the Group’s debt, considered as the cost for the year calculated on an annual basis and
resulting from the ratio of debt-related expenses to average exposure, stood at approximately 3.9%, while it is
equal to approximately 4.1% considering the application of IFRS 16.

™ “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Current securities other than investments” for a total of 4,015 million euros
(3,043 million euros at December 31, 2018);

™ Revolving Credit Facility amounting to 5,000 million euros.

This margin is sufficient to cover Group financial liabilities falling due over the next 30 months.
In particular:

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to 3,138 million euros (1,917 million euros at December 31, 2018). The
different technical forms of investing available cash can be analyzed as follows:

™ maturities: investments have a maximum maturity of three months;

Report on Operations of the Consolidated Financial Position and Cash Flows Performance | 50
TIM Group
™ counterparty risk: investments by the European companies are made with leading banking, financial and
industrial institutions with high credit quality. Investments by the companies in South America are made with
leading local counterparties;

™ Country risk: deposits have been made mainly in major European financial markets.

Current securities other than investments amounted to 877 million euros (1,126 million euros at December 31,
2018): These forms of investment represent alternatives to the investment of liquidity with the aim of improving
returns. They included a total of 333 million euros of Italian and European treasury bonds held by Telecom Italia
Finance S.A., 395 million euros of bonds purchased by Telecom Italia Finance S.A. with different maturities, all
with an active market and consequently readily convertible into cash, and 149 million euros of investments in
monetary funds by the Brazil Business Unit. The purchases of the above government bonds, which, pursuant to
Consob Communication no. DEM/11070007 of August 5, 2011, represent investments in “Sovereign debt
securities”, have been made in accordance with the Guidelines for the "Management and control of financial
risk" adopted by the TIM Group.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, reported adjusted net financial debt decreased by 223 million euros compared to
September 30, 2019 (27,891 million euros).

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
OPERATIONS AND THEIR ECONOMIC ASPECTS

Environmental and social changes underway pose economic risks, but also business opportunities for TIM, that
has a leading role in the economy of the main countries where it operates; in a digital world, it is a strategic
necessity to find a sustainable balance between new business models, new classes of services, new working
methods and new professional skills that contribute to achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the
UN's 2030 Agenda.

The analysis process conducted in 2019, in order to identify stakeholder interests relative to the social,
environmental and economic impacts business activities have both in and outside the Company, showed that
opportunities related to the digital transformation of companies and citizens' services are material issues for the
Group.
The analysis also showed how essential it was for TIM to play a lead role in developing digital expertise and
knowledge in its own dimension and in a capacity as enabler for a new digital society. The strong stakeholder
focus on the role of the Company as a facilitator for the development of an inclusive digital society was also
revealed by the analysis.
There is also great interest in the environmental approach and measures taken to combat climate change and
its consequences. To this end, TIM contributes with products and services that allow businesses and families to
reduce their energy consumption and cities to lower their emissions; electromagnetism also emerged as an
issue.
The following are a few cases in which social and environmental elements have direct economic impacts on TIM
and, lastly, a description is provided of the materiality analysis, the details of which are provided in the Group’s
Sustainability Report/Disclosure of non-financial information.

RATIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION MANAGEMENT

TIM is one of the biggest electricity users nationally, consuming around 1.873 TWh of energy per year.

In recent years, TIM has intensified its energy efficiency activities, implementing significant efficiency measures
that in the last three years have led to around 123 GWh of energy efficiency (cumulative value of the three years).
During 2019, other possible levers were also assessed and identified to exploit TIM's energy potential, aimed at:

™ increasing efficiency at industrial/multi-use sites;

™ increasing distributed generation for self-consumption also with the construction of 6 new trigeneration
plants (testing scheduled for the beginning of 2021) with a total installed power of 9.4 MWh and an estimated
electricity saving regime of about 85 GWh/year (about 13 million euros in annual savings);

™ increasing the amount of energy from renewable sources both through the purchase of guarantees of origin
(at the end of 2019 guarantees of origin were purchased to cover approximately 23% of total withdrawals)
and with the construction of new photovoltaic systems (expected installed power about 10 MWp4 - with an
expected production of 3 GWh in 2020 and about 13 GWh/year when fully operational).

The savings related to these initiatives will be fully operational in the 2020-2022 plan period.

During 2019, network compaction activities continued and savings related to the already begun space
rationalization and site disposal plan, including data centers, took effect. These activities led to a total net
reduction of energy consumption of the Domestic BU in 2019 of approximately 75 GWh compared to 2018.

In economic terms, despite the significant reduction in consumption, there was an increase in spending linked to
the increase in energy prices in 2018, the year that forward purchases were made for energy delivered in 2019.
During 2018, the value of the emission certificates went from 7 euros/ton to more than 25 euros/ton, thus
significantly increasing the variable cost of marginal technology on the spot market, which led to a strong upward
movement in the reference prices for forward market transactions. The spot market, which then turned bearish
in 2019, due to the wide availability of gas in Europe and high hydraulicity, only partially offset the outlay, which
therefore stood at higher levels than the previous year.

In addition, communication campaigns to support efficiency projects were launched in 2019, aimed at informing
and raising the awareness of all TIM staff and promoting virtuous and conscious behavior to make the system
more efficient. This will continue during 2020, and was recognized as part of the initiatives relating to the energy
efficiency month, promoted by the Ministry of Economic Development and ENEA, following which TIM received
the "Italy in Class A" stamp.

TIM Group aspects
TIM areas with a potentially significant environmental impact have adopted an Environmental Management
System (EMS) certified in accordance with ISO 14001 to manage their operating processes in a sustainable way.
In some cases, the EMS is integrated with the Quality Management System based on the ISO 9001 standard, for
which the relative certification has been obtained.

At some particularly important sites, an Energy Management System has been developed. In continuity with
previous years, TIM, through the Energy & Utilities Management department, also achieved ISO 50001
certification this year for offices where this System was operational. The certification perimeter includes the
"historical" headquarters in Bologna via Stendhal, the Piacenza Centro exchange, the Rozzano 1, 2 and 3 Data
Centers, and the Padua and Bologna Roveri Data Centers.

EFFICIENCY PLANS AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT - ENGAGEMENT
WITH WORKERS' REPRESENTATIVES

TIM pays much attention to listening and involving workers' representatives in many areas of work, including
reorganization processes.

The search for constant dialog and discussion with union representatives led to major agreements being
reached, aimed at reconciling the needs of the business with those of the people who work in the company. This
has allowed agreements to be reached for the implementation of efficiency improvement plans that can
mediate between the needs of the workers and those of the company. In particular, the accelerated technological
transformation that the telecommunications sector is undergoing has determined the need to tackle company
evel integrated activities of organizational review, digitization of processes and adaptation of the entire staff's
skills and capabilities.

n this context, and after the application of the “defensive solidarity” agreements for the period 2016-2017,
extended until June 2019, in 2019 as part of the negotiation for the renewal of the second level contract, a set of
agreements was defined between the Company Parties aimed at combining the achievement of the objectives
set out in the Business Plan with the safeguarding of the needs of workers, including the Expansion Agreement
hereinafter the Contract), introduced by Law no. 58/2019 with the aim of supporting the technological
development processes of companies with more than 1,000 employees.

The Contract (signed in August 2019 by the government) is an innovative tool that combines efficiency and
development needs, allowing companies to adapt the skills of their staff and acquire new ones from the external
market.
TIM and trade union representatives recognized the need and urgency to jointly face, in a framework of certain
and shared rules, the effects of the ongoing digital revolution, implementing all useful actions both to protect
employment and for the evolution of professional skills.
The Contract provides for 600 new permanent employees to enter the Company, during the two-year period

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

As required by Legislative Decree 254/2016 and according to the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative
Standards, TIM carried out the materiality analysis process again in 2019, to identify the socio-environmental
and governance priorities against which to report business activity, its results and its impact internally and
externally of the Company.

Process to identify the material topics

In keeping with the methodology started in 2017, TIM assessed the validity of the material issues identified the
previous year, validating or reviewing their titles and descriptions, to make them increasingly specific, adopting
evolved semantic analysis techniques, to analyze a larger number of information sources and also continued its
analysis of big data, in order to collect external points of view.

The taxonomy® to adopt in the semantic engine was updated, using the same sustainability and digital
references as those in 2017, in more recent versions and expanding the number. In particular:

™ Global Reporting Initiative Standard, ISO 26000, Sustainable Development Goals and_ specialist
assessments®;

™ Italian Digital Agenda, Objectives of the European Digital Single Market and dedicated indexes,’ besides
regulatory references which are relevant for TIM and its stakeholders.

The semantic engine analyzed all the national and international sources of information, public and non-public
sources, internal and external to TIM8 with different interactions leading to the definition of a list of topics based
on the occurrences? found in the various documents and establishing hierarchies between the topics. The
material topics of the sector were identified through the occurrences, which were compared with the topics that
emerged from the 2018 'tree' and validated in meetings between the main Group functions and the
Sustainability Reporting, Monitoring and Relationship (SRMR) department.

In order to obtain the significance of the material topics for the company, an internal questionnaire was given to
a significant sample of representative contact people from all the company's departments.

As stated, collecting external points of view was facilitated by the use of innovative tools such as semantics and
big data analysis, as well as a collaboration platform".

At the end of this initial screening, the company was able to draw up a list of topics representing the following
macro areas:

™ correctness of corporate conduct

= stakeholder engagement

= integrating social and environmental and governance aspects into corporate strategies
= management of employment relationships;

=~ developing the Company's human resources;

= ~~ managing the health and safety of workers

= correct management of customer relationships;

= safeguarding privacy and personal data protection and security;

= investing in the development of 5G and UBB infrastructure and in R&D;

= safeguarding diversity and promoting equal opportunities in the Company;

= stimulating the spread of digital technologies and skills;

= integrating social and environmental aspects in the supply chain;

™ protecting vulnerable categories (cyberbullying, child pornography, gambling);

5Each taxonomy is made up of interrelated concepts and keywords with different correlation and significance levels. Each taxonomy was constructed
using both Italian and English terms.
® For example RobecoSam (Dow Jones Sustainability Index), FTSE4good and Sustainalytics questionnaires.
7 For example, the Digital Economy Society Index which monitors different aspects of the digitization level of the individual European countries.
® For example: The “Piano Nazionale italiano per l’Agenda 2030” (Italian National Plan for the 2030 agenda) of the Italian government, the “Ernst &
Young Megatrends report 2018”, the “Fair and Sustainable Well-Being in Italy 2018” (BES) report promoted by the National Council for Economy
and Labor (CNEL) and the National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT).
° The occurrences identify the number of times that a concept (or a specific term) is detected within the document by the semantic engine and provide
an indication of the significance of the topic detected in the context of the document.
2° In keeping with activities of the previous years, stakeholders involved in engagement activities were surveyed, in addition to many other entities, for
a total of approximately 500, concerning 8 categories of TIM stakeholders. Three types of sources were identified for the analysis:
x documents issued by stakeholders (in particular sustainability reports);
x statements issued on company websites;
x discussions on social networks concerning the themes identified thanks to TIM Data Room activities.
1 q questionnaire was provided to engage and consult stakeholders, via the platform, from the categories: customers, suppliers, competitors,
institutions, environment, community, persons, also collecting suggestions and feedback.

= promoting and safeguarding human rights;

™ reducing energy consumption and combating climate change;
= impact of electromagnetic emissions;

=~ promoting the development of an inclusive digital society.

This approach has enabled TIM to expand stakeholder engagement and dynamically observe topics in order to
measure their trends over time.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Approach to innovation, choice of topics, innovation governance
process

Innovation, understood as a research and development activity for technologies and services, processes and
innovative business models, represents a key factor in the company’s ability to keep up with the profound
transformations of ICT as an asset acting as a driving force in this evolution in terms of benefits for customers
and the national system, helping to overcome the socio-cultural barriers that limit the opportunity to participate
in the information society and enjoyment of the relative benefits.

TIM has always considered innovation to be a strategic asset and takes great care in governing individual aspects,
from its strategic role to its responsibility, objectives and policy.

In terms of role, both technological and business-based innovation are also confirmed in 2019 as the central
element to the response to change in the technological, market and competitive context. In line with this, the
Group has taken action in several ways:

™ by continuing the action, underway for several years now, to strengthen internal innovation lines, focusing
laboratory activities and research groups on key aspects of the development of the fixed and mobile network
towards future 5G standards and ultrabroadband, and issues concerning service platforms and new
operations systems;

™ by confirming the drive towards the “Open Innovation” principle with the aim of maximizing the benefits
deriving from the integration of innovative contributions generated internally with external sources of
innovative ideas;

™ by focusing on the innovation capacity of startups with the TIM Wcap acceleration program and investment
in risk capital (equity) made by TIM Ventures, TIM's corporate venture capital;

= by implementing initiatives which allow for the growth of co-creation ecosystems like the loT Open Lab, a
laboratory dedicated to the development of loT solutions based on key technologies for the Telco Operator
with a view to open innovation.

More specifically, innovation management is overseen, with different missions, by the Technology Architectures
& Innovation Department and by engineers, but involves various internal and external stakeholders of the
company:

= other areas of the company involved from time to time, both as internal customers for the innovation output
solution and as centers of expertise on the topic;

= traditional and digital partners, for the joint go2market of digital services;

™ research centers and universities, for cooperation and joint projects. In 2019, 9 research contracts were
started;

™ Standardization Bodies and Associations: in 2019, TIM joined two new international bodies: the 5GAA (5G
Automotive Association), for the acceleration and promotion of the industrialization of connected mobility
services, and the O-RAN‘4 Alliance (Open RAN Alliance), an initiative with the world's leading carriers
promoting greater degrees of openness and programmability of radiomobile access systems. Therefore, both
closely connected with the digital transformation process that the Company is undertaking in the context of
5G. With these last two, TIM now has membership with 29 bodies, for a commitment of about one million
euros;

™ Ministries (Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of Education, Universities and Research), the
European Union and public authorities (CNR and local authorities) for projects funded through participation
in competitive tenders, and partnership initiatives. In particular, 2019 saw TIM contribute, in the context of
the Competence Industry Manufacturing 4.0 (CIM 4.0) established at the end of 2018, to the design proposal
and creation of production lines based on the new Industry 4.0 technology, to encourage the transfer of
technological skills and innovation in production processes, products and business models;

= TIM has built a "joint innovation and shared success" path with Huawei and Cisco, while it has signed a
strategic agreement with Microsoft for the development of artificial intelligence, which adds to the numerous
collaborations between the two companies, both in Italy and Brazil. Artificial intelligence, with Data Analytics
and Big Data Advanced Analytics equipment, is now an indispensable lever for digital transformation.

TIM's technological evolution is based on the CTO Technology Strategy, which identifies technology strategy in
terms of guidelines, specific technologies and roadmaps to adopt in the long term. The three-year technological
plan is the reference policy for the Group and includes the technological evolution plans of subsidiaries. The plan
sets out the main external factors that may affect company strategies (regulation, standards, suppliers, other
market operators) and establishes the company entities involved, the applicable technological architecture and
evolution of specific technologies, along with relative roadmaps for deployment or assessment. The qualitative

and/or quantitative goals address the long term and have been given an annual framework. They are defined so
that they can be objectively measured in compliance with quality standards (ISO 9001) and environmental
standards (ISO 14001), and operational innovation processes; in the same way as TIM processes, in general, are
based on Telemanagement Forum's reference standard E-Tom.

Overall, in 2019 TIM committed around 1,300 people to working on technological innovation and engineering in
Italy, for an overall investment for the Company of 1,113 million euros, which is equivalent to around 8% of
domestic revenues.

Activities for the future of mobility and networks: initiatives for 5G

In February 2019, TIM turned on the new 5G network in Sanremo, as the main sponsor of the 69th Italian Song
Festival. It also brought the new mobile network to the stadiums of Rome and Udine, doubling the 4.5G mobile
network performance and laying the foundations for fans to be able to experience the new 5G digital football
match.
In the same month TIM presented ten startups - grown in TIMWCAP (the Group's open innovation incubator) -
at the Mobile World Congress 2019 in Barcelona. The ten projects embrace different areas of application, such
as entertainment and new e-sports, personal finance, digital commerce, mobile payment solutions and loT
solutions based on artificial intelligence.
Again in February 2019, TIM's partnership began with Vodafone for 5G infrastructures, to optimize investment in
fifth generation networks.
In May, in Genoa, the first tests of innovative 5G services for territory control and monitoring began, with the use
of drones and rover-type vehicles, remotely controlled over the mobile network. The initiative was part of the
agreement signed between the Liguria Region, the Municipality of Genoa, Liguria Digitale, Ericsson and TIM for
the "Digital Lab 5G".
in Rome, In July, TIM officially launched 5G and announced the cities already covered (Naples, Rome and Turin)
and the development plans, together with the commercial offers and the first services available right away for
consumer and business customers.
At the end of July, TIM brought 5G to Naples and, in early August, signed a memorandum of understanding with
the Municipality of Turin which strengthened the collaboration to make the Piedmontese capital an cutting edge
"digital city" model with 5G.
In August 2019, TIM switched on 5G at the 40th Rimini Meeting and presented the digital services of the future
in an area entirely dedicated to 5G solutions and innovative startups: from smart benches for the smart city
model to virtual reality sightseeing.
In November 2019, in Turin, TIM and the Municipality of Turin presented the first live 5G Edge Cloud network with
connected drones in Europe. By enabling the integrated processing of big data collected by loT platforms and
analyzed by Artificial Intelligence systems, the 5G Edge Cloud is the key to the development and diffusion of
digital services for the Smart City: public safety and self-driving cars, environmental monitoring and Industry 4.0.

The 5G Edge Cloud network guarantees very wide bandwidth and low latency and allows a very large quantity
of data to be aggregated and processed, ensuring digital services with extremely secure high quality levels that
respect customer privacy, as well as greater agility and flexibility for service and application configuration
according to the typical logic of the cloud. In Turin, 5G was also the star at the 5GAA world event, where TIM
presented exclusive "live demos" of connected roads. The road demos were carried out in collaboration with the
Municipality of Turin and other partners and are part of the Smart Roads project: cameras and sensors on
pedestrian crossings (Road Site Units) connected to the 5G network, warn surrounding vehicles of pedestrians
crossing; on-board units (OBU) placed on a bicycle and a vehicle, capable of sending messages to the cyclist's
smartwatch and the car's display to warn of their mutual positions and increase attention levels.
In real traffic conditions, TIM then presented the Urban Georeferenced Alert service, developed in collaboration
with the Municipality of Turin, FCA, Links Foundation, Turin Polytechnic, SWARCO and 5T, and capable of
providing useful information for traffic, such as notifying of works, queues and speed reduction signs; this data
is sent to TIM's 5G Digital Business Platform which, via the 5G network, sends it to the car, allowing the driver to
make any necessary decisions.
2019 ended with two impressive demonstrations of TIM's 5G potential. The first was a live surgery procedure with
immersive 5G reality, watched by over 30,000 specialists and surgeons from all over the world in live
multistreaming mode; the second took place at the Monza racetrack, in December 2019, during the Monza Rally
Show 2019, with live demos of the new TIM 5G enabled services: automotive, industry 4.0, digital tourism, smart
cities and drones.

Research with Universities

The Open Innovation activities (understood as R&D participatory behavior) for 2019 were largely concentrated
on the new Innovation model pursued at TIM. Research and development activities were consequently focused
on infrastructure issues and application solutions with a particular emphasis on opportunities afforded by 5G.

In particular:

™ collaboration with the Polytechnic of Turin on twenty research projects on issues of both technological
innovation linked to 5G and the UltraBroadBand, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence with

TIM Group
application scenarios in numerous contexts (for example loT and drone use). In one of the projects, the
ethical and privacy issues that may emerge with the use of artificial intelligence solutions was addressed;

™ research projects defined within the MiSE (Ministry for Economic Development) Bari Matera 5G project, which
sees TIM collaborate with six academic bodies: the National Research Center (CNR), the Superiore Sant’Anna
School of Pisa (SSSA), the Polytechnic of Bari, the University of Bari, the University of Basilicata and the
University of Salento. In 2019, the research projects focused on 5G and the development of new use scenarios
in the numerous application areas developed during trials (such as Healthcare 5.0, Public Safety, Smart
Agriculture, Environmental Monitoring and Smart City). One of the projects was dedicated to assessing the
socio-economic impact linked to 5G trials;

™ collaboration with the State University of Milan: financing for two research doctorates (PhDs), under a three-
year agreement, within which a research project began in 2019 to create a "family activity recognition"
module, using data acquired by sensors to provide service and content suggestions to family members
through the digital family assistant. The collaboration is part of the Innovation Joint "Open Lab" (JOL)
initiatives of Innovation TIM in Milan;

™ the agreement with the University of Turin, within which a study and research project was launched on
"intelligent conversational systems" aimed at better and more effective human-machine interaction;

™ collaboration with the University of Catania, within the "Joint Open Lab (JoL)" of Catania framework, an
instrument which TIM's innovation works with to accelerate the finalization of the whole loT ecosystem and
its market activities for development of 5G.

Funded research activities

TIM has always been active in innovative and research initiatives funded by the European Commission and by
national public administrations. This has allowed TIM to take part in international projects on high innovative
content issues that it is working on, and through which it has been possible to both extend and consolidate its
know-how in sectors with extremely fast technological evolution and to collaborate with the most significant
research centers, academic bodies and industries both in the main European countries and in Taiwan and Japan;
participation in the projects made it possible to attract financing of around 16 million euros in the 2017-2019
three-year period. In this area, it has been involved in activities carried out as part of funded projects concerning
5G, virtualization and intelligent mobility services, on one hand, furthering its own expertise and on the other,
gaining a prominent position in the international sphere.

Patents and Intellectual Property Rights

In 2019, the Group's patent portfolio was consistent with that of previous years; indeed, there was a slight
increase in assessment activities for patenting and a slight contraction in new filings. In addition, the
rationalization of the patent portfolio has led to some patents being abandoned which, with technological
evolution, are no longer of any value The Group's patent areas relate to the entire ICT sector, with specific
excellence in the mobile sector, in particular in radio access, where TIM is among the leading TLC operators in
the world.

At December 31, 2019, the portfolio included over 3,300 patents, of which 88% were patents (granted by 38
offices) relating to approximately 600 patented inventions.

Itis significant that a high number of patents -12% of inventions - come out from collaborations with universities
and research institutes.

Participation in a Patent Pools for LTE (Long Term Evolution), with a patent invention essential for the relative
standard should also be noted. The Patent Pool acquired new participants over the course of the year (bringing
the current total to 25 license-holders) and granted several licenses to 48 companies.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN BRAZIL

The Architecture & Innovation Technology department? is responsible for TIM Participagédes' Research and
Development (R&D) activities; its main responsibilities are to define technological innovation for the network and
information technology, determine evolutionary needs for new technologies and devices and link architectural
guidelines and strategic partnerships, to use the new business models and ensure the network infrastructure
evolution is in line with the corporate strategy.

In December 2019, the Architecture & Innovation Technology department was made up of 52 people, including

TIM Group
The creation of TIM Lab was an important step. It is a multi functional environment focused on innovation,
capable of evaluating innovative technologies, products and services, certifying their functional efficiency and
performance, developing new models and configurations, to consolidate the innovation flow. TIM Lab plays a
strategic role in supporting Credibility Tests and trials, collaborating with the main suppliers and technology
partners through knowledge sharing, technological infrastructure for interoperability tests, staff assessment and
the definition of technical requirements; in synergy with the R&D department, it facilitates innovation activities
and promotes partnerships with universities and research institutes.

In 2019, over 140 validation processes were performed relating to new software, features, solutions, technologies,
services and devices. TIM Participagdes has invested more than 2.7 million reais in instruments, infrastructures
and services and - in the 2020-2022 period - further investments are planned for over 10 million reais.

The Architecture & Innovation Technology department continued to work on projects and initiatives for the
evolution of the business of TIM Participagdes through the recommendation of sustainable and efficient network
platforms, as well as “disruptive” models, including anticipating the availability of new services. These projects
can be divided into the following macro groups:

™ next generation network;

™ with positive impact on the environment and society;
™ future internet applications;

™ Open Lab Initiatives.

Next generation network projects

The reassignment of the 1,800 MHz, 850 MHz and 2,100 MHz bands from 2G/3G to 4G, with a multilayer
distribution configuration gives TIM Participagdes three important competitive advantages:

™ areduction in costs for the LTE implementation?’;

™ the increase in the LTE coverage area and the enabling of the Carrier Aggregation strategy, improving the
customer experience;

™ the best indoor coverage. In addition to the expansion of coverage, use of the 850/1,800/2,100 MHz
bandwidths could increase the capacity in cities already covered by the LTE bandwidth at 2.6 GHz, at limited
additional cost.

n this scenario, over 96% of current LTE terminals are compatible with the 1,800 MHz, 2,600 MHz bands and
other available bands. Therefore, the implementation of the multilayer LTE continues to be an excellent strategy
that benefits from the spread of devices.

The implementation of the 700 MHz LTE layer continued to significantly improve coverage expansion and indoor
penetration. The actual implementation will comply with the rules of the EAD48, so as to manage spectrum
cleaning and avoid problems of interference with TV broadcasting services. 86% of TIM Participagdes' current
user base of LTE devices is 700 MHz enabled (December 2019).

At the end of December 2019, 2,313 cities had 700 MHz LTE coverage equivalent to over 93% of the urban
population; spectrum cleaning was completed in June 2019 in all cities of Brazil; it is expected that by 2021 more
than 3,300 covered cities will be covered by TIM Participagdes in the 700 MHz band.

n 2017, TIM, as part of the IP Multimedia Network Evolution, launched VoLTE (voice over LTE) high definition voice
call services onto the market. These call services do not need to go through the switching technology of “legacy”
circuits, and can be used by 100 approved smartphone models. In December 2019, this service was enabled in
3,401 cities (data from the Geomarketing report).

Projects with positive environmental and social impacts

The expansion of "RAN Sharing 4G", in partnership with other mobile operators in Brazil, aims to define the
architectural requirements, technical assumptions and specifications for the "LTE RAN sharing}®" solution,
optimizing network resources and costs. The RAN sharing agreement allows TIM to promote the evolution of the
spread of LTE in the Brazilian campaign, effectively sharing access and backhaul2°. Currently, 4G RAN Sharing is
based on three national partners, expanding the benefits and efficiency of this technical model. Following tests
and the consequent activation of energy saving functions and solutions, according to the access technology (2G,
3G and 4G) and coverage conditions, it showed a reduction of up to 10%.

loT - In 2018, TIM Participagdes launched the first NB-loT commercial network! in South America, in the city of
Santa Rita do Sapucai, to develop innovative services together with the INATEL University (Telecommunication

National Institut). Again in 2018, TIM activated NB-loT coverage in the cities of Itajubd, in collaboration with
UNIFEI (Federal University of Itajuba), and Rio de Janeiro.

Two important milestones were achieved in 2019: the activation of an E-SIM (Embedded SIM) platform and the
acquisition of an loT/M2M platform. These two infrastructures will allow TIM Participagdes to implement an E2E
M2M/loT system, allowing it to promote important innovations and new products, aimed at using the potential
of loT in different vertical sectors.

Agrobusiness - Since 2018, together with Nokia and BR Digital, TIM Participagdes has been focusing on agro-food
potential in Brazil, offering connections in rural areas (not only for business applications but also for the digital
inclusion of agrobusiness employees and residents of small towns). One of the projects delivered in April 2018
for Jalles Machado, an energy group in the city of Goianésia, replaced manual reporting with mobile, improving
communication between office and field; moreover, it allowed computers on board agricultural machinery to
manage information in real time. 812 smartphones and 1,006 company lines were integrated in this project, with
650 smartphones for field work. TIM strengthened its position in relation to vertical agriculture2? in 2019, with the
creation of the ConnectarAgro ecosystem (https://conectaragro.com.br/) which brings together TIM, solution
providers for the agro segment and telecommunication solution providers.

5G - In April 2018, the “Architecture & Innovation Technology" department completed its research and
interference tests in the city of Guaratiba (State of Rio de Janeiro) in the 3.5 GHz band, considered to be the
cutting edge 5G band. The aim was to demonstrate that fixed satellite service reception can coexist, without
limits, with the use of the 3.5 GHz band.
In June 2019, TIM Participagdes chose three cities, Florianopolis, Santa Rita do Sapucai and Campina Grande to
test 5G technology. In September, TIM set up its Casa TIM 5G office, in particular for HackTown 2019, the
innovation festival sponsored by TIM Participagées for the first time. Casa TIM 5G, with a specific ANATEL license,
has shown that it can interactively provide accessible solutions (with the arrival of 5G) for health, education,
safety, entertainment and games, directly to where people live and work; some demonstrations were developed
in collaboration with Ericsson, Qualcomm, Cisco and Inatel, as well as ABB, Intel and LG.

Open Lab initiatives

TIM Participagées joined the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) in 2017, an initiative founded by Facebook, SK Telecom,
Deutsche Telekom, Nokia, Intel and other companies, which aims to create a new approach to building and
implementing the telecommunications network infrastructure. TIM Participagdes transformed TIM Lab into the
first TIP Community Lab in Latin America, available to TIP members to create universal standards for solutions
initially transport networks, Open Optical Packet Transport working group), to overcome the challenges related
to interoperability of different supplier products.

n 2018, TIM Participagées also joined a new working group within the TIP, together with Vodafone and Telefonica,
called DCSG (Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway? ). This project is an opportunity to define a common set of
operator requirements and coordinate with companies that manufacture devices, which have wider and more
flexible capacities and are cheaper.

n June 2019, with Facebook support, TIM Participagdes organized a Proof of Concepts of IPInfusion's DCSG
solution and Core EDGE suppliers and TIP members, to demonstrate the solution's main features.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR 2020

We are going through an extraordinary and unprecedented period of health emergency across the worldwide.
The impact on global and Italian GDP trends is not quantifiable at the moment and will depend on the duration,
intensity and effectiveness of the containment.

For 2020 TIM confirms its strategy of strong discontinuity with the past, already started in 2019, focusing on
execution as a key element of TIM’s organic transformation.

In the Domestic market, the Consumer segment aims to enhance its uniqueness as a convergent operator
through targeted offers for the family and by expanding the range of services to customers, including through
new partnerships with specialized players. The joint venture between TIM and Santander Consumer Bank,
through which TIM customers will gradually be offered consumer credit services, financial products and
insurance products, is also in this perspective. The Business segment will continue to offer itself as a benchmark
provider and top ICT quality partner for SMEs and as a full ICT provider for large customers, enriching its portfolio
with cloud services. The National Wholesale segment will defend its access market share and confirm its
leadership in ultra-broadband coverage. The common objective of all segments is the improvement of customer
satisfaction through the efficiency of customer care, provisioning and pre and after-sales service to the end
customer.

The Telecom Italia Sparkle group will expand its infrastructure and grow enterprise networking and the cloud;
partnerships to accelerate growth and expand strategic options will also be assessed.

In Brazil, the growth of ARPU and the management of Churn in the post-paid and prepaid segment will be the
levers for revenue growth. The Network infrastructure development program will also continue, with the
objective of covering the growth in data consumption using new access technologies and spectrum efficiency
techniques, preparing the Network for 5G, including the expansion of the dedicated infrastructure for loT Services
and Fixed UltraBroadBand.

TIM’s strategy to reduce debt by increasing operating cash generation, especially in the domestic market, is also
continuing in 2020, achieved through stabilization of revenues, a streamlined cost structure, and the optimization
of working capital and invested capital.

The technological approach outlined in the new TIM plan puts modernization, simplification and artificial
intelligence at the heart of future capital expenditure. TIM has started the development of a completely new and
automated 5G network on a national scale, starting from the main metropolitan areas, industrial districts and
areas with high tourist density, while continuing with the divestment and consolidation of redundant assets or
obsolete technology. TIM is the first telecommunications operator in Europe to use live network quantum
computing algorithms in the planning of its next generation mobile networks.

TIM Group
MAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Risk governance is a strategic tool for value creation. The TIM Group has adopted an Enterprise Risk Management
Model based on the methodology of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(ERM CoSO Report), which enables the identification and management of risk in a uniform manner across the
Group companies, highlighting potential synergies among the actors involved in the assessment of the Internal
Control and Risk Management System. The ERM process is designed to identify potential events that may affect
the business, to manage risk within acceptable limits and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
achievement of corporate objectives.
Moreover, the business outlook for 2020 could be affected by risks and uncertainties caused by a multitude of
factors, the majority of which are beyond the Group's control.
In this context we highlight the health emergency due to the recent spread of the COVID-19 virus and qualified,
as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition to the worsening of the global
macroeconomic scenario and the risk of deterioration of the credit profile of certain customer segments, this
pandemic could lead to slowdowns in business activities, resulting from measures issued by national and foreign
authorities, the consequent reorganization of the internal work organization with remote control of most
activities and limitation of certain types of technical and commercial interventions, difficulties encountered by
customers and discontinuity in the supply chain, with negative impacts on the overall results of the Group. The
management of this emergency phenomenon requires, also in consideration of the public service provided, the
implementation of all activities relating to the operational continuity of business processes with the aim of
ensuring the functionality of the services provided and the protection of employees’ health.
In addition, non-exhaustively, the following additional factors are mentioned: a change in market context, entry
of new potential competitors in the fixed-line and mobile sphere, the initiation of procedures by Authorities and
consequent delays in the implementation of new strategies, any constraints connected to the exercise of the
Golden Power by the Government with effects - currently not foreseeable - in terms of strategic choices and
progress of the already announced three-year objectives which may entail, for some, different timing than that
initially scheduled or relative achievement with new and more joined-up paths.

The main risks affecting the business activities of the TIM Group, which may impact, even significantly, the ability
to achieve the objectives of the Group are presented below in an analytical way.

STRATEGIC RISKS

Risks related to macro-economic factors

The TIM Group's economic and financial situation depends on the influence of numerous macroeconomic factors
such as economic growth, consumer confidence, interest rates and exchange rates in the markets where it
operates. In 2018, the Eurozone economy experienced an unexpected slowdown, which continued throughout
2019. The slowdown in the Italian economy was more evident than in other European countries: after the growth
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Italian economy remained substantially stable, with minimal changes
in the order of 0.1%.

In 2019, GDP grew by 0.3% compared to +0.8% in 2018.!

The slowdown in the Italian economy reflects the deceleration in world trade (due to negative shocks from the
persistent protectionist policies of the United States and the trade war between the United States and China)
and the uncertainties relating to Europe's automotive sector. On the domestic front, mention should be made
of the slowdown in the family services sector, influenced in their spending decisions by the crisis in confidence
resulting from the climate of uncertainty that is also affecting businesses. Despite the growth in disposable
income, the increase in the propensity to save has had a negative impact on consumption. On the business front,
inventories have decreased as a result of the trend to meet domestic demand, albeit on the rise, without
increasing production.
In Brazil, the expected results may be significantly affected by the macroeconomic and political situation. After
two years of falling GDP, which marked one of the deepest crises in Italy's history, growth returned in 2017 (+1%)
and 2018 closed with a growth of 1.1% compared to the previous year. According to the latest 2019 Focus Report
from Brazil's Central Bank, the expected GDP growth for 2019 is slightly below 1.2%, unchanged when compared
with the previous year. Although the government has successfully approved the Social Security Reform, the
market is still waiting for some structural changes to improve the Brazilian government's investment capacity
for a more significant recovery. In addition, turmoil in the external market, such as the trade war between the
United States and China and Brexit, will have further effects on the Brazilian economy's recovery.

Risks related to competition

The telecommunications market is characterized by strong competition that may reduce market share in the
geographical areas where the TIM Group is engaged as well as erode prices and margins. Competition is focused

Report on Operations of the Main risks and uncertainties | 72
TIM Group
on innovative products and services and on the capacity to move towards higher levels of convergence in service
and expand it to the content offering, but also on the price competition in both traditional and other services.
The use of new technologies (loT) and new knowledge and customer management tools (Big Data) represent
enabling factors in the mitigation of competition risks, however failure to exploit these opportunities could
become an additional element of risk.

liad launched its new mobile service at the end of May 2018, with the objective of capturing 10-15% of the
market, adopting the same strategies it currently employs on the French market. In addition, Open Fiber and
nfratel started up plans for the development of an UltraBroadBand telecommunications network as an
alternative to the TIM network, respectively in major Italian cities and in areas of market failure, opening up the
possibility of a new wave of competition in those areas, with impacts for both the Wholesale and Retail
segments.

he Brazilian market lie in the rapid transition of the business model tied to traditional services
consolidation of the sector. As the consumption patterns of consumers change (migration
from voice to data services), service providers need to act swiftly in upgrading their infrastructure and
modernizing their portfolios of products and services. In this context, the Tim Brasil group could be impacted by
the need to upgrade its technologies and infrastructure rapidly and by greater competition, in the form of
aggressive sales strategies and potential business combinations in the sector. At the same time, the slow
recovery from the country's deep economic crisis and the delay in the necessary structural reforms have directly
affected consumption, in particular in the prepaid segment.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Operational risks inherent in our business relate, on the one hand, to failures in systems and/or network
platforms, loss of critical or commercially sensitive data, possible inadequacies in internal processes, external
factors, frauds, employee errors and errors in properly documenting transactions; and on the other, to the
possibility of implementing strategies for value creation through the optimization of costs and capital
expenditure, which in part could depend on factors beyond the control of the Company, such as the cooperation
of external counterparties (suppliers, trade unions, industry associations) and laws and regulations.

Risks related to the development of fixed and mobile networks

To maintain and expand our customer portfolio in each of the markets in which the TIM Group operates, it is
necessary to maintain, update and improve existing networks in a timely manner. A reliable and high quality
network is necessary to maintain the customer base and minimize terminations to protect the Company's
revenues from erosion.

The maintenance and improvement of existing installations depend on the Group's ability to:

™ deliver network development plans within the time-frames contemplated by business development plans
and with the necessary level of effectiveness/efficiency;

™ upgrade the capabilities of the networks to provide customers with services that are closer to their needs;

™ increase the geographical coverage of innovative services;

™ upgrade the structure of the systems and the networks to adapt it to new technologies;

a

sustaining the necessary level of capital expenditure in the long term.

Risks related to business continuity

The TIM Group's success depends heavily on the ability to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted delivery of
the products and services we provide through the availability of processes and the relating supporting assets,
which are sensitive to various internal and external threats. TIM has adopted a “Business Continuity Model

System” framework in line with international stand

ards, to analyze and prevent these risks.

TIM considers Business Continuity a fundamental factor for
in the provision of its services and in full compliance wit!

the protection of the Group's Value and Reputation,
h what is defined in customer contracts, in sector

regulations and, more generally, in consistency wit

h reference methodologies and best practice.

Within the TIM Group, Business Continuity is defined as "the organization's ability to guarantee continuity in the
provision of services in relation to predefined and acceptable levels following a disruptive incident".

The operational scope of any technological, organizational, logistical and commercial process connected directly
or indirectly to the main national and regional telecommunication network infrastructure and TIM's National
Data Centers infrastructure are included in the scope of application of this policy, as well as the infrastructure
itself.
TIM implements an ongoing management and governance process which, supported by the Company
Management, ensures that the necessary steps are taken to identify the impact of potential losses, that recovery

Report on Operations of the Main risks and uncertainties | 73

TIM Group
plans and strategies are practical and that continuity of services is guaranteed through training programs, tests,
exercises and periodic updating and revision activities.

The prevention model adopted to ensure Business Continuity, even in crisis situations, is the Business Continuity
Management System (BCMS), defined in the specific Organizational Procedures in accordance with the ISO 22301
international standard. The model identifies specific roles and responsibilities.
The Business Continuity Department works within the TIM Security Department and is responsible for the
governance of the corporate risk prevention process, which may lead to interruptions or unacceptable
degradation of TIM business and supporting the corporate functions to identify, quantify and implement security
initiatives aimed at reducing identified risks.
To guarantee an operational link between the aforementioned Department and the other corporate
Departments, Business Continuity Contacts are identified in Departments and specific operational relationships
are outlined.
Company departments are responsible for Business Continuity activities on the processes and services they are
responsible for, which they do by identifying the most relevant ones and the ways in which to guarantee their
continuous operation, even in situations of interruption or severe degradation.
The most relevant issues concerning Business Continuity are brought to the attention of Top Management in the
specific Steering Committee.

Risks related to disputes and litigation

The TIM Group has to deal with disputes and litigation with tax authorities and government agencies, regulators,
competition authorities, other telecommunications operators and other entities. The possible impacts of such
proceedings are generally uncertain. In the event of settlement unfavorable to the Group, these issues may,
individually or as whole, have an adverse effect, which may even be significant, on its operating results, financial
position and cash flows.

Risks of internal/external fraud

Technological progress means that increasingly sophisticated tools and techniques, which are quick acting and
have a considerable economic impact are available for fraudulent activity.

“Conventional” phenomena such as subscription, interconnection, and commercial fraud currently generate the
highest part of revenue loss and will continue to be significant in the near future, however new types of Internet-
style fraud will gradually gain more ground (Internet spamming/phishing, service reselling, VoIP bypass, etc.).
Furthermore, some specific types of provided services (e.g. wholesale interconnection, voice or data services) are
potentially at risk of third party use for the construction of fictitious transaction schemes, tax avoidance offenses
and/or international money laundering.

By way of example only, Fraud Management covers:

= traffic or marketing-related fraud;

™ fraud connected with procurement processes and the supply of goods and services;
™ computer fraud;

= fraud related to the use and disclosure of confidential information;

™ tax and/or financial fraud;

which are:

™ identified by specific controls during routine working activities, or reported from sources inside/outside the
company;

™ committed by entities outside the company, or by or with the assistance of employees (internal fraud).

The TIM Group has an established organizational model based on the governance of fraud and a separate
operational governance system for managing and combating fraud.

The procedure to combat external fraud, drawing on company processes at risk of the offenses contemplated in
Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 being committed, sets out internal control mechanisms, including
instructions on how employees and Company staff/partners (including suppliers) must behave (Prevention). In
the Detection stage, potential cases of fraud are identified and after a preliminary check of the possible grounds
the cases may be subject to Investigation and Tackling. To complete the fraud management end-to-end cycle,
the results of actions taken are assessed with monitoring and any actions to improve the fraud management
process are identified.
The fight against internal fraud, implemented in compliance with the limits imposed by the recently updated
trade union agreements prohibiting distance monitoring of staff at work, is carried out through the detection of
information relating to the concentration of anomalous operations that flag-up possible cases of serious
wrongdoing. The control is automated and provides access to pseudonymised data. Only when suspicion of
illegal conduct is confirmed does the Security Fraud Management department ask the system administrator

TIM Group
concerned to make the information on the anomalous event intelligible, to allow for the consequent activities to
protect the company. However, the data is not used to check work performance.

Golden Power

The "Golden Power" Decrees that give the government special powers over corporate structures in the defense
and national security sectors, as well as for activities of strategic importance in the telecommunications sector,
affect the public-private relationship, in addition, adding value to the technological assets and services included
in the Golden Power perimeter, with content derived from the pursued institutional purpose.

In summary, the Prime Minister established that the Company is subject to the obligations pursuant to Legislative
Decree no. 21/2012 (special powers rules) on September 28, 2017, as a business that:

™ carries out "activities of strategic importance for the defense and national security system" (as per article 1
of the Legislative Decree) and

™ possesses networks and systems "necessary to ensure the minimum supply and operation of essential public
services" and goods and relationships “of strategic importance for the national interest" in the
communications sector (as per article 2 of the same Decree Law).

The regulatory architecture relating to TIM, consequently, involved a first phase in 2017 on the issue of the Prime
Ministerial Decrees of October 16 and November 2.

The government's ruling was subsequently integrated with the Law of May 20, 2019, no. 41 which included
measures relating to electronic broadband communication services based on 5G technology within a wider
framework of urgent measures”.

With the aforementioned ruling of October 16, 2017, the Prime Minister exercised the special powers provided for
in article 1 of the Golden Power Decree by imposing specific provisions and conditions on TIM and the Sparkle
and Telsy subsidiaries. The measures concern corporate and organizational governance; in particular, the Prime
Minister requires the presence on the respective Boards of Directors of a Security Chief Executive Officer -
currently coinciding with the Chief Executive Officer - (who has Italian citizenship and security authorization) and
the establishment of a Security Organization unit.
This organizational unit is responsible for activities relevant to national security and the regulations also require
that it is involved in all decision-making processes relating to strategic activities and the network and is assigned
to a Security Officer chosen from a list of names proposed by the Department of Information Security in the
Prime Minister's Office.
TIM, Sparkle and Telsy must also provide prior information on any decision that may, among other things, reduce
or yield technological, operational and industrial capabilities in strategic activities.
These measures also relate to the prior communication obligation of corporate decisions (appointments, sales,
etc.) as well as information on network and exchange development, investment and maintenance plans, to
preserve their functionality and integrity, as well as the obligation to notify of any corporate action that may
have an impact on their security, availability and functioning.

With a ruling on November 2, 2017, the Prime Minister's Office also exercised the special powers provided for in
article 2 of the Golden Power Decree, through the imposition of further requirements and conditions.

With the 2019 Ruling, the Legislator imposed the exercise of special powers in relation to the supply of 5G
technology produced outside the EU, stating that these communication services constitute activities of strategic
importance for the National Defense and Security system.

FINANCIAL RISKS

The TIM Group may be exposed to financial risks, such as risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and
exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and risks related to the performance of the equity markets in general,
and - more specifically - risks related to the performance of the share price of the TIM Group companies. These
risks may adversely impact the earnings and the financial structure of the Group. Accordingly, to manage those
risks, the TIM Group has established guidelines, at central level, which must be followed for operational
management, identification of the most suitable financial instruments to meet set goals, and monitoring the
results achieved. In particular, in order to mitigate the liquidity risk, the TIM Group aims to maintain an "adequate
evel of financial flexibility", in terms of cash and syndicated committed credit lines, enabling it to cover
refinancing requirements at least for the next 12-18 months.
The potential impact of Brexit will depend on the result of negotiations on the future relationship with the EU,
especially that of a commercial nature, which will follow the separation on January 31, 2020.

Brexit and possible future scenarios connected to the outcomes of negotiations could cause further instability
on global financial markets in an international context that is already affected by the trade dispute between the
US and China.
The potential effects of Brexit on financial risks (interest rates, exchange rate and counterparty) are not
considered significant for TIM and the Group, but could be significant for the business of some subsidiaries.

n addition, the TIM Group's financial risk management policies provide for the full hedging of exchange rate risk
and the minimization of exposure to interest rate and counterparty risk and are also effective in the Brexit
context.

TIM Group
REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS

Regulatory risks

The electronic communications industry is highly regulated. As such, new decisions by the Communications
Authority (AGCom) may lead to changes in the regulatory framework that may affect the expected results of
the Group and the guidance announced to the market. In addition, the position of significant market power held
by TIM In the fixed-line access markets and the structure of the mobile markets results in high levels of scrutiny
from the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM) over competition in the sector.

The main elements that introduce uncertainty are:

™ lack of predictability in start-up timing and consequent final decisions in new proceedings by AGCom and
AGCM;

™  AGCom decisions with retroactive effect (for example, the revision of prices applicable to past years and the
effectiveness and actual implementation of repricing policies, also following administrative rulings);

™ AGCom decisions that can influence the technological choices, with potential impact on the timing of return
on infrastructure investment;

™ any AGCM decisions that can limit TIM's competitive capacity (for example, in terms of minimum retail prices
to guarantee replicability);

™ any inadequacy in the implementation of processes and systems for the management of regulated services,
identified by AGCom or AGCM.

™ any AGCom or AGCM decisions that impose constraints on the pricing of fixed-line and mobile offers on the
basis of consumer protection legislation.

Compliance risks

The TIM Group may be exposed to risks of non-compliance due to non-observance/breach of internal (self-
regulation, such as, for example, bylaws, code of ethics) and external rules (laws, regulations, new accounting
standards and Authority orders), with consequent judicial or administrative penalties, financial losses or
reputational damage.

The TIM Group aims to ensure that processes, and, therefore, the procedures and systems governing them, and
corporate conduct comply with legal requirements. The risk is associated with potential time lags in making the
processes compliant with regulatory changes or whenever non-conformities are identified and is monitored by
the dedicated internal control system.

Compliance with Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR), directly
applicable as from May 25, 2018 and enacted in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 101/2018 is particularly important.
This Regulation has increased administrative fines considerably compared to the Data Protection Act previously
in effect, and in some cases fines of up to 20 million euros may be administered, or in the case of companies, of
up to 4% of their global annual turnover of the previous year, if this amount is higher than 20 million euros.
Starting from the operating model already in use with pre-existing privacy regulations, the TIM Group has taken
necessary action to comply with the GDPR.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

n this Report on Operations, in the TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Separate Financial
Statements of the Parent, TIM S.p.A., for the year ended December 31, 2019, in addition to the conventional
financial performance measures established by IFRS, certain alternative performance measures are presented
for a better understanding of the performance of operations and financial position. Such measures, which are
presented in the periodical financial reports (annual and interim), should, however, not be considered as a
substitute for those required by IFRS.

n particular, following the adoption of IFRS 16, the TIM Group also presents the following additional alternative
performance indicators:

= EBITDA adjusted After Lease (“EBITDA-AL”), calculated by adjusting the Organic EBITDA net of the non-
recurring iterns, amounts connected with the accounting treatment of the finance leasing contracts
according to IAS 17 (applied until year-end 2018) and according to IFRS 16 (applied starting from 2019). This
financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal presentations (business plans) and in
external presentations (to analysts and investors). It represents a useful unit of measurement for the
evaluation of the operating performance of the Group (as a whole and at the Business Unit level) and of the
Parent, TIM S.p.A., in addition to EBIT;

= Adjusted net financial debt After Leases, calculated by excluding from the adjusted net financial debt the
liabilities related to the accounting treatment of the finance lease contracts in accordance with IAS 17
(applied until year-end 2018) and according to IFRS 16 (applied starting from 2019). TIM believes that the
Adjusted net financial debt After Lease represents an indicator of the ability to meet its financial obligations.

The other alternative performance measures used are described below:

= EBITDA: this financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal presentations (business plans)
and in external presentations (to analysts and investors). It represents a useful unit of measurement for
assessing the operating performance of the Group (as a whole and at Business Unit level) and of the Parent,
TIM S.p.A., in addition to EBIT. These measures are calculated as follows:

Profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations

+ Finance expenses

- Finance income

+/- Other expenses (income) from investments “

+/- Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method ”

EBIT - Operating profit (loss)

+/- Impairment losses (reversals) on non-current assets
+/- Losses (gains) on disposals of non-current assets
+ Depreciation and amortization

EBITDA - Operating profit before depreciation and amortization, capital gains (losses) and impairment reversals (losses) on
non-current assets

(a)"Expenses (income) from investments” for TIM S.p.A.
(2) Line item in Group consolidated financial statements only.

™ Organic change and impact of the non-recurring items on revenues, EBITDA and EBIT: these measures
express changes (amount and/or percentage) in Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, excluding, where applicable,
the effects of the change in the scope of consolidation, the exchange differences and the non-recurring
events and transactions. TIM believes that this method of presentation provides a more complete and
effective interpretation of the Group's operating performance (as a whole and with reference to the Business
Units) and of the Parent; it is therefore also used in the presentations to analysts and investors. This Report
on Operations provides a reconciliation between the “reported figure” and the “organic excluding the non-
recurring component” figure.

= EBITDA margin and EBIT margin: TIM believes that these margins represent useful indicators of the ability
of the Group, as a whole and at Business Unit level, and of the Parent to generate profits from its revenues.
In fact, EBITDA margin and EBIT margin measure the operating performance of an entity by analyzing the
percentage of revenues that are converted into EBITDA and EBIT, respectively. Such indicators are used by
TIM in internal presentations (business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors) in
order to illustrate the results from operations also through the comparison of the operating results of the
financial year being reported with those of the previous years.

= Net Financial Debt: TIM believes that the Net Financial Debt represents an accurate indicator of its ability to
meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less Cash and Cash Equivalents and

other Financial Assets. The Report on Operations includes two tables showing the amounts taken from the
statements of financial position and used to calculate the Net Financial Debt of the Group and Parent.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual
indicator (renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure called “Adjusted
net financial debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial markets. Given that
some components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the exchange and
interest rate for contractual flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result
in actual monetary settlement, the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these purely accounting and non-
monetary effects (including the effects of IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement) from the measurement of
derivatives and related financial assets/liabilities.

Net financial debt is calculated as follows:

+ Non-current financial liabilities

+ Current financial liabilities

+ Financial liabilities directly associated with Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale
A) Gross financial debt

+ Non-current financial assets

+ Current financial assets

+ Financial assets relating to Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale

B) Financial assets

C=(A- B) Net financial debt carrying amount

D) Reversal of fair value measurement of derivatives and related financial liabilities/assets
E=(C +D) Adjusted net financial debt
