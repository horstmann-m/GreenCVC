ADOPTION OF THE NEW IFRS 9 AND IFRS 15 STANDARDS

On November 22, 2016, Regulation (EU) No. 2016/2067 was issued, which adopted IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments)
at EU level, relating to the classification, measurement, derecognition and impairment of financial assets and
liabilities, and hedge accounting.

As allowed by the accounting standard, the Tim Group:

™ did not restate the comparative information provided in the year of first application, also due to the
complexity of reformulating values at the beginning of the first year presented without the use of factors
known later; therefore, the effects deriving from the first application of IFRS 9 were recognized in equity at
January 1, 2018;

™ decided to continue to apply the hedge accounting provisions contained in IAS 39 instead of those of IFRS 9.

The different classification of financial assets had no substantial impact for the TIM Group on the measurement
of those assets, while the introduction of the expected credit loss model replacing the incurred loss model
required by IAS 39, resulted in a reduction of 107 million euros in consolidated equity at the transition date of
January 1, 2018.

On September 22, 2016, Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1905 was issued, which adopted IFRS 15
(Revenues from contracts with customers) and the related amendments at EU level. On October 31, 2017,
clarifications to IFRS 15 were adopted through Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2017/1987.

IFRS 15 replaces the standards that formerly governed revenue recognition, namely IAS 18 (Revenue), IAS 11
(Construction contracts) and the related interpretations on revenue recognition (IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty
programmes, IFRIC 15 Agreements for the construction of real estate, IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers
and SIC 31 Revenue - Barter transactions involving advertising services).

The TIM Group has applied the modified retrospective method with the recognition of the cumulative effect of
the first-time application of the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity for the period when
the standard is adopted, without restating prior periods.

The comprehensive net impact (including tax effects) of the adoption of IFRS 15 on consolidated equity at
January 1, 2018 (transition date) was positive for 19 million euros and mainly connected with the combined
effects of:

™ the change in the types of contract costs that are deferred;

™ the new approach to recognizing activation and installation revenues and the recognition of contract assets
connected with the earlier recognition of revenues from bundle offers.

Further details are provided in the Note “Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements at
December 31, 2018 of the TIM Group.

To enable the year-on-year comparison of the economic and financial performance for the year 2018, this Report
on Operations also shows “comparable” financial position figures and “comparable” income statement figures,
prepared in accordance with the previous accounting standards applied (IAS 39, IAS 18, IAS 11, and relative
Interpretations).

FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

In terms of economic and financial performance in 2018:

™ Consolidated revenues amounted to 18,940 million euros; comparable consolidated revenues amounted to
19,109 million euros, showing a drop of 3.6% compared to 2017, mainly due to the effects of the major
depreciation of the Brazilian real, which lowered the contribution of the Brazil Business Unit to consolidated
revenues, which are denominated in euros; in organic terms the Group’s consolidated revenues increased
by 0.1%.
Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 4,863 million euros. The comparable
figure (4,892 million euros) shows a drop of 5.0% (-2.5% in organic terms).

™ EBITDA was equal to 7,403 million euros; Comparable EBITDA amounted to 7,713 million euros, down by
1.0% on 2017 (+2.6% in organic terms), with an EBITDA margin of 40.4%, +1.1 percentage points on the figure
for 2017 (40.4% in organic terms, +1.0 percentage points).
EBITDA for 2018 reflected a negative impact totaling 408 million euros relative to non-recurring net
expenses.
EBITDA for 2017 reflected non-recurring expenses for a total of 883 million euros.
In the absence of these impacts, organic EBITDA would have been equal to 8,121 million euros, down by
3.4% over 2017, with an EBITDA margin of 42.4% (-1.6 percentage points).
EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 1,625 million euros. Comparable EBITDA amounted to
1,683 million euros, up by 6.7 million euros compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 (+10.9% in organic terms).

EBIT amounted to 561 million euros; comparable EBIT amounted to 727 million euros, down -77.9% on 2017
(-77.3% in organic terms).

The EBIT was pulled down by 2,590 million euros relating to the goodwill impairment loss attributed to the
Core Domestic Unit and International Wholesale: specifically, as at September 30, 2018, a goodwill
impairment loss of 2.0 billion euros was recognized for the goodwill assigned to the Core Domestic Unit;
during preparation of the annual financial statements, the impairment test was repeated and an additional
impairment loss of 450 million euros for the Core Domestic Unit was recognized - bringing the overall
impairment loss for 2018 to 2,450 million euros - as well as an impairment loss of 140 million euros for the
goodwill assigned to International Wholesale.

Excluding this impairment loss as well as the negative impact of non-recurring net expenses totaling 408
million euros (912 million euros in 2017, at constant exchange rates), the change in EBIT would have been -
9.5%.

Consolidated EBIT for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to -56 million euros. Comparable EBIT amounted
to -35 million euros (457 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2017).

Consolidated net loss for the year attributable to Owners of the Parent amounted to 1,411 million euros
(while a net profit of 1,121 million euros was posted in 2017). The positive contribution from operating
activities and the recognition of deferred tax assets in Brazil was offset by the aforementioned goodwill
impairment loss of the Core Domestic Unit and International Wholesale, as well as other non-recurring net
expenses and the effects of IFRS 9 and 15 application. Excluding those impacts, consolidated net profit for
2018 attributable to Owners of the Parent would have amounted to over 1.4 billion euros.

Capital expenditures in 2018 amounted to 6,408 million euros. On a comparable basis, they amounted to
6,558 million euros (5,701 million euros in 2017), showing an increase of 857 million euros. In particular, the
increase deriving from higher investments in mobile phone licenses - and in particular the purchase by the
Domestic Business Unit in the last quarter of 2018 of the rights to use 5G frequencies (2,399 million euros) -
was offset by lower capital expenditures in fixed and mobile domestic networks, also due to the coverage
levels achieved with current technology, as well as the fluctuations in Brazilian exchange rates.

Adjusted net financial debt amounted to 25,270 million euros at December 31, 2018, a decrease of 38 million
euros compared December 31, 2017 (25,308 million euros): cash flow generation from operations and
financing activities in 2018 was affected by the payment of 739 million euros of income taxes, 477 million
euros relative to the portion of the award amount due for 2018 for rights to use 3700-3800 MHZ and 26.5-
27.5 GHZ frequencies in Italy and the payment of dividends for a total of 256 million euros.

‘Alternative Perfo

The obligations laid down in Legislative Decree 254/2016, regarding the disclosure of sensitive information of a
non-financial nature and on diversity, have been the object of reporting by TIM Group since 1997, the year in
which the Group published its first “Social Report”, subsequently extended to cover environmental issues.

The current Sustainability Report follows a multi-stakeholder approach involving the joint analysis of actions
taken in respect of the main stakeholders with whom the Company interacts. It is based on the main reference
standard for Sustainability Reporting and on the principles (inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness) of the
AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard (APS 2008), adopted by the Group as of the 2009 Financial
Statements.

The 2018 materiality matrix, which summarizes the point of view of the Company and stakeholders, also
identified the Sustainable Development Goals which the Group considers it can significantly contribute to,
through its own operations.

Such non-financial reporting stands alongside the company’s positioning in major sustainability indices, which
in 2018 saw the TIM Group included, for the 15th consecutive year, in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices World
(DJSI World) and Europe (DJSI Europe), and its inclusion in the Euronext Vigeo World 120, Eurozone 120 and
Europe 120 indices.

For more details of TIM's approach to sustainability and results achieved, see the 2018 Sustainability Report -
Non-Financial Disclosure.

Non-recurring events - other one-off items

In the years 2018 and 2017, the TIM Group recognized non-recurring net operating expenses connected to
events and transactions that by their nature do not occur on an ongoing basis in the normal course of operations
and which have been shown because their amount is significant. Such expenses include the goodwill impairment
loss, corporate restructuring and reorganization expenses, expenses resulting from regulatory disputes and
sanctions and the liabilities related to those expenses, expenses for disputes with former employees, and
liabilities with customers and/or suppliers, as well as items related to adjustments relative to previous years.

Non-recurring net expenses in 2018 included:

™ the goodwill impairment loss attributed to the Core Domestic unit and International Wholesale (2,590 million
euros);

™ expenses related to company restructuring processes (233 million euros);

™ sundry expenses for 135 million euros including provisions to cover a fine of 74.3 million euros levied for
alleged infringement of Article 2 of Italian Decree Law 21 of March 15, 2012 (the “Golden Power” rule) under
aruling of May 8, 2018. TIM lodged an appeal with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court (TAR), requesting
the precautionary suspension of the decision. In July 2018, the TAR granted the application and suspended
payment of the fine, setting a date for the appeal to be heard;

™ the adjustment of some contractual liabilities in order to align them with their estimated period end value.
Specifically, liabilities relative to "prepaid" contracts were adjusted by a total of 62 million euros, wholly
attributable to previous financial years;

™ the positive effect of the Brazil Business Unit tax recovery, equal to 37 million euros, following the favorable
outcome of the tax dispute relative to the unconstitutional grounds of the law that entailed the inclusion of
ICMS indirect tax in the base for calculating taxes on PIS and COFINS revenues.

Non-recurring expenses in 2017 chiefly included provisions for the start-up of the company restructuring plan of
TIMS.p.A..

For comparative purposes only and to provide a better understanding of business performance in the reporting
period, besides non-recurring transactions, “one-off” items are highlighted which, by their nature, are not linear
or recurring, in the reporting period or the comparative period. Such above-mentioned items exclusively pertain
to the Domestic market, are not subject to auditing and are produced for explanatory purposes only.

In 2017, positive one-off items for a total of 112 million euros were posted, relative to the differential impact
arising from the revised estimate of the settlement value of some contractual liabilities with customers and
suppliers.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PERFORMANCE

Revenues

Revenues amounted to 18,940 million euros in 2018.

Comparable revenues on the same accounting basis amounted to 19,109 million euros, down by 3.6% (-719
million euros) on 2017 (19,828 million euros); the decrease is mainly attributable to the Brazil Business Unit (-543
million euros), due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real of approximately 20% compared to 2017, and the
Domestic Business Unit (-169 million euros). Without the negative exchange rate effect", the Brazil Business
Unit saw growth of +189 million euros (+5.0%) and the organic change in consolidated revenues for the Group
was up by 0.1% (+27 million euros).

Revenues for 2018 include a non-recurring adjustment of -62 million euros relating to previous financial years.

equal to approximately 6 million euros.

The net decrease of 542 million euros was mainly driven by:

° the decrease of 473 million euros for restructuring expenses and allocations to employee and other
provisions of the Italian component. Specifically, a plan was launched at the end of 2017 for executive
and non-executive staff to adopt, among others, Article 4(1-7-ter) of Law 92 of June 28, 2012 (the
“Fornero Law”, which provides for early retirement arrangements). During 2018, Plan take-up was
greater than initially forecast, while Decree Law 4 of January 28, 2019, which introduced significant
changes in social security, allows wider accessibility in terms of recourse to assisted pensions. Therefore,
estimates for staff leaving in 2019-2020 were revised, with additional non-recurring provisions being
allocated for a total of 204 million euros; In 2017, provisions were already set aside for non-recurring
expenses totaling 697 million euros;

° lower ordinary employee expenses for the Italian component, which fell by 31 million euros, mainly due
to the benefits delivered by the reduction of the average salaried workforce by -1,447 employees
(excluding the component relating to the solidarity agreement), which only in part were offset by the
termination, at the start of 2018, of the “defensive solidarity” agreements applied by TIM S.p.A.. The
solidarity agreement was renewed in June 2018 for a further 12 months;

° the decrease of 47 million euros in the component outside Italy of ordinary employee expenses, mainly
due to the balance between the impact of the change in exchange rates and local remuneration
dynamics of the Brazil Business Unit.

Net impairment losses on non-current assets

This item amounted to 2,586 million euros in 2018 and mainly refers to the overall goodwill impairment loss of
2,590 million euros, recognized during the year and related to the Domestic Business Unit.

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on at least an
annual basis, when preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2018, with
reference to the Core Domestic CGU, internal and external events and circumstances had arisen that led the
company to carry out impairment testing on the CGU and brought a recognition of an Impairment loss relative
for an amount of 2,000 million euros.

In the 2018 Financial Statements, the annual impairment test resulted in an additional impairment loss of 450
million euros on the goodwill attributed to the Core Domestic CGU - bringing the total impairment loss for the
financial year 2018 to 2,450 million euros - as well as an impairment loss of 140 million euros on the goodwill
attributed to the International Wholesale CGU.

With reference to the Brazil Cash Generating Units, the Impairment test exercise did not show any impairment
losses to the Goodwill allocated to the said CGUs.

In 2017, net impairment losses on non-current assets amounted to 37 million euros and mainly consisted of
write-downs of intangible assets.

Further details are provided in the Note “Goodwill” to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31,
2018 of the TIM Group.

EBIT

EBIT amounted to 561 million euros for 2018.

Comparable EBIT for 2018 totaled 727 million euros (3,291 million euros for 2017), a drop of 2,564 million euros (-
77.9%) compared to 2017; the EBIT margin stood at 3.8% (16.6% in 2017).

Organic EBIT was down by 2,476 million euros (-77.3%), with an organic EBIT margin of 3.8% (16.8% in 2017).
Organic EBIT, net of the non-recurring component, amounted to 3,725 million euros (4,115 million euros in 2017),
with an EBIT margin of 19.4% (21.6% in 2017).

EBIT for 2018 reflected the negative impact of non-recurring net expenses, including the aforesaid impairment
loss on goodwill of the Core Domestic unit and International Wholesale totaling 2,998 million euros (912 million
euros in 2017, at constant exchange rates).

Income/(expenses) from investments

In 2018, this item showed a positive figure of 10 million euros and mainly included the dividends paid to TIM
S.p.A. by the company Emittenti Titoli.

In 2017, this item amounted to an expense of 18 million euros and essentially included the allocation to the
income statement of the Reserve for exchange differences on translating foreign operations for the investee
company Tierra Argentea S.A., the liquidation of which was completed that year.

Finance income (expenses), net

Finance income (expenses) show a net expense of 1,348 million euros (expense of 1,495 million euros in 2017):
the improvement was mainly driven by lower finance expenses, connected to the reduction in the Group’s
average debt exposure and a drop in interest rates from the refinancing operations carried out over the last 12/18
months.

Income tax expense

This itern amounted to 375 million euros, a drop of 115 million euros on 2017 (490 million euros). Specifically, the
figure for 2018 benefited from approximately 200 million euros contributed by the Brazil Business Unit, from the
recognition of deferred tax assets related to the tax recoverability of past losses recorded in previous years that
had become recoverable based on the expected profits. This impact was offset by the Parent TIM S.p.A.'s higher
taxes, in relation to the impact of certain items in the 2018 financial year which have no tax relevance (mainly
driven by the goodwill impairment loss and other non-deductible sundry expenses and minor benefits).

The net loss for 2018 attributable to Owners of the Parent amounted to 1,411 million euros (while a net profit of
1,121 million euros was posted in 2017). The positive contribution from operating activities and the recognition
of deferred tax assets in Brazil was offset by the aforementioned goodwill impairment loss of the Core Domestic
Unit and International Wholesale, as well as other non-recurring net expenses and the effects of IFRS 9 and 15
application. Excluding those impacts, consolidated net profit for 2018 attributable to Owners of the Parent would

have amounted to over 1.4 billion euros.

Revenues

Revenues for 2018 amounted to 15,031 million euros. Comparable revenues on the same accounting basis
amounted to 15,185 million euros for 2018, down by 169 million euros on the previous year (-1.1%). Revenues for
2018 include a non-recurring adjustment of -62 million euros relating to previous financial years.

In the fourth quarter, revenues recorded a drop of 168 million euros (-4.2% compared to the fourth quarter of the
2017).

The revenues from services amounted to 13,834 million euros (-166 million euros over 2017, equal to -1.2%),
impacted by the effects of a changed regulatory and competitive scenario (30-day pricing restored, entry of a
fourth mobile operator and a reduction in the prices of some wholesale services).

In detail:

™ revenues from services for the fixed-line market amounted to 9,951 million euros, remaining stable with
respect to 2017 despite stronger market competition. Such stabilization was due to higher retail ARPU, higher
revenues from ICT solutions (+99 million euros compared to 2017, +14.8%) and from innovative services for
data connectivity (+306 million euros, +14.4%), also driven by growth in Ultrabroadband customers (+1.0
million on 2017) that at the end of 2018 reached 3.2 million (5.4 million including wholesale lines). These
dynamics offset the natural decline in revenues from traditional voice services (-334 million euros), due to the
decrease in traditional accesses and lower regulated prices on some wholesale services (-65 million euros);

™ revenues from services for the Mobile market were equal to 4,513 million euros (-142 million euros, equal to -
3.1% on 2017) and were affected to a greater extent by the changed regulatory and competitive scenario, with
a downturn in calling and broadband ARPU.

Revenues from product sales, including the change in work in progress, amounted to 1,351 million euros in 2018
(-3 million euros on the previous year).

EBITDA

EBITDA for the Domestic Business Unit for 2018 amounted to 5,955 million euros.

Comparable EBITDA for 2018 totaled 6,221 million euros, up by 50 million euros compared to 2017 (+0.8%), with
an EBITDA margin of 41.0% (+0.8 percentage points compared to the previous year).

Organic EBITDA rose by 53 million euros (+0.9%) compared to 2017, with the organic EBITDA margin posting an
increase of 0.8 percentage points, from 40.2% in 2017 to 41.0% in 2018.

Organic EBITDA, net of the non-recurring component, amounted to 6,629 million euros (7,050 million euros in
2017). Specifically EBITDA for 2018 reflected a negative impact totaling 408 million euros referring to non-recurring
expenses as already described.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, organic EBITDA amounted to 1,263 million euros, showing an increase of 146 million
euros (+13.1%) compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, with the EBITDA margin posting an increase of 5.0
percentage points, rising from 27.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 32.6% for 2018.

In detail:

™ Consumer: revenues for 2018 in the Consumer segment were equal to 7,573 million euros, down on the

performance of the previous year (-164 million euros, -2.1%), in contrast to the growth registered in 2017, due
to the changed competitive and regulatory scenario (entry of a fourth mobile operator, 30-day pricing
restored). The same trend seen in total revenues also applied to revenues from services, which amounted to
6,834 million euros, down by 1.6% compared to the previous year (-114 million euros). In particular:

* Mobile revenues amounted to 3,835 million euros (-1.5% on the previous year); revenues from services fell
by 122 million euros (-3.7% over 2017), with a more marked slowdown in the fourth quarter compared to
the trend observed the previous year, attributable to the changed regulatory and competitive scenario;

° revenues from the Fixed-line market totaled 3,696 million euros, down over the previous year (-3.0%), but
with revenues from services in line with 2017; this trend reflected a decrease in accesses, offset by higher
ARPU levels.

Business: revenues for the Business segment amounted to 4,721 million euros, up by 65 million euros on 2017
(+1.4%) attributable to revenues from services (+1.4%). In particular:

* Mobile revenues show a positive performance compared to 2017 (+1.8%), driven mainly by higher revenues
from services (+1.2%) and, in particular, growth in new digital services (+2.7% on 2017);

*° Revenues from the fixed-line market rose by 41 million euros (+1.1% over 2017), thanks to the performance
of services (+1.4%); lower prices and revenues from traditional services (connected with the technological
shift towards VoIP systems and solutions) were more than offset by steady growth in revenues from ICT
services (+14.7%).

Wholesale: revenues for the Wholesale segment in 2018 came to 1,787 million euros, up by 97 million euros
compared to 2017 (+5.8%). Cuts to regulated prices, which lowered revenues by 65 million euros, were mainly
offset by growth in access, driven by the Ultra-Broadband segment.

Revenues for the International Wholesale Cash-Generating Unit for 2018 totaled 1,272 million euros, showing a
drop of 77 million euros on the 2017 figure (-5.7%). This trend is mainly related to the downturn in revenues from
traditional telephone services and to the expiry of long-term contracts relative to the Mediterranean Basin area
(IP/Data services).

The International Wholesale Cash-Generating Unit comprises the Telecom Italia Sparkle group companies; a share
of the TIM group goodwill was allocated to the CGU. In the 2018 Financial Statements, the value of the assigned
goodwill was written down for an amount of 140 million euros following the impairment test.

Further details are provided in the Note “Goodwill” to the TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements at
December 31, 2018.

Revenues

Revenues for 2018 amounted to 16,981 million reais. Comparable revenues for 2018, amounting to 17,050 million
reais, were up by 816 million reais (+5.0%) on the previous year.

Revenues from services, on the same accounting basis, amounted to 16,205 million reais, rising by 731 million
reais on the 15,474 million reais posted for 2017 (+4.7%).

Revenues from product sales, on the same accounting basis, came to 845 million reais (760 million reais for 2017,
+11.2%). The increase reflects the change in the sales policy, which is now focused more on value than on
increasing sales volumes. The main goals of the new strategy are to increase purchases of new connected
devices giving TIM customers access to broadband services on 3G/4G networks and to support new retention
offerings for higher-value postpaid customers.

On the same accounting basis, Mobile Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for 2018 was equal to 22.4 reais, up by
+11% on the figure for 2017 (20.2 reais), due to a general repositioning towards the postpaid segment and new
commercial initiatives aimed at increasing data usage and the average spend per customer.

Total lines in place at December 31, 2018 amounted to 55.9 million, a decline of 2.7 million compared to
December 31, 2017 (58.6 million). The lower figure was driven entirely by the prepaid segment (-5.1 million), only
partially offset by growth in the post-paid segment (+2.4 million), in part due to the consolidation underway in
the market for second SIM cards. Postpaid customers accounted for 36.2% of the customer base at December
31, 2018, an increase of 5.8 percentage points on December 2017 (30.4%).

Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 4,457 million reais. Comparable revenues were equal to
4,479 million reais, an increase of 5.2% compared to the same period of the previous year (4,257 million reais).

EBITDA

EBITDA for 2018 amounted to 6,316 million reais.

Comparable EBITDA for 2018 amounted to 6,508 million reais, up by 614 million reais on the previous year
(+10.4%). Growth in EBITDA was attributable to both the positive performance of revenues and the benefits
delivered by projects to enhance the efficiency of the operating expenses structure.

The EBITDA margin, on the same accounting basis, rose by 1.9 percentage points on 2017 to reach 38.2%.

The Brazil Business Unit reported net non-recurring income in 2018 of 2 million reais, mainly relative to the
positive effect of the favorable outcome of the tax dispute concerning the unconstitutional grounds of the law
that entailed the inclusion of ICMS indirect tax in the base for calculating taxes on PIS and COFINS revenues (159
million reais at an EBITDA level), which was mainly offset by the recognition of expenses related to the forecast
revision of labor litigation arising in previous years.

EBITDA, net of the non-recurring component, was equal to 6,506 million reais.

EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 1,807 million reais. On the same accounting basis, the figure
came to 1,856 million reais, showing growth of 98 million reais on the fourth quarter of 2017. The EBITDA margin
for the fourth quarter of 2018 stood at 41.4%, up by 0.1 percentage points on the same period of the previous
year (41.3%).

EBIT

EBIT for 2018 amounted to 2,428 million reais. Comparable EBIT for 2018 rose to 2,449 million reais, up by 518
million reais (+26.8%) on the same period of the previous year (1,931 million reais). Growth was mainly driven by
higher EBITDA (+614 million reais) and slightly higher depreciation and amortization (96 million reais).

Net of the non-recurring component, EBIT was equal to 2,447 million reais.

EBIT for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 807 million reais. On the same accounting basis, the figure came
to 813 million reais, showing growth of 84 million reais on the fourth quarter of 2017 (+11.5%). The EBIT margin
for the fourth quarter of 2018 stood at 18.2%, up by 1.1 percentage points on the same period of the previous
year (17.1%).

MAIN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC

Consumer

TIM is driving the country's digital revolution, continuing to invest in innovation through the development of fixed
and mobile ultrabroadband networks, platforms and highly customized quality services based on customer
needs. TIM is also committed to spreading a digital culture for leisure, offering innovative, flexible and
increasingly convergent products that boast the best multimedia content, with films, TV series, music, video
games, sports' news and major events, delivered through decoders, smart TVs, the Web and mobile apps.

In 2018, TIM continued to develop the fixed consumer market, with its new convergent, quadruple play deal for
families TIM Connect,launched in April at a price starting from 26.90 euros/month. The deal offers a fiber
connection with download speeds of up to 1000 Mbps and upload speeds of up to 100 Mgbs, including a free-
loan modem and Timvision. The Gold version, at a price of 29.90 euros/month, also includes unlimited calls from
home to landline numbers and national mobile numbers; while the Black version, at a price of 39.90 euros, offers
1,000 minutes of calls from a mobile telephone and 5 GB of data traffic, plus international calls to all zone 1
landline numbers.

All new TIM Connect deals also offer the TIM Expert service. For an additional charge, customers receive the
expert assistance of a TIM engineer in their home when activating the deal, to test and optimize the performance
of their new Internet connection. To support the launch of the new TIM Connect deals, additional promotions
were offered and renewed during 2018; these include the promo Limited Edition or Winter Edition (with an
extra 2 euros/month off the basic price for new customers), and specific promotions for customers purchasing
deals online.

To support fixed-mobile convergence, TIM launched the TIM 100%promotion in March, targeting its most loyal
customers that choose TIM as the operator for both their home and mobile connection, with 5 GB of data traffic
free each month. In July, the promotion was extended to cover 3 SIM cards of TIM, even if not held in the name
of the main SIM card owner, and the fixed network, for even greater benefits.

Throughout 2018, TIM continued to support the use of new fiber technology, with offers for customers that
already have ADSL and can use the FTTCab service, to migrate towards the new technology, at no additional
cost.

As regards the drop in customers due to transitions from fixed lines to the mobile segment, the new TIM Flexy
offer was launched in November, targeting second-home owners in particular. TIM Flexy is the first deal for fixed
network browsing at speeds of up to 200 Mbps, to use even for just one weekend. This solution, which is perfect
for second-home owners and for homes used for occasional weekends away or short breaks is offered as a pay-
as-you-go deal starting from €5.90. TIM Flexy is the solution for customers who want to connect from home
when they want - for two, seven or thirty days. The Internet deal offers unlimited traffic, with no voice service.
Further developments were made in 2018 to bring Fixed-line Consumer deals in line with the obligations of
AGCOM decisions, including Decision 292/18/CONS (which establishes a new system to identify various types of
Internet accesses based on the type of connection between the exchange and the user location), and Decision
348/18/CONS (which establishes measures on access to an open Internet, with specific reference to the freedom
of choice of handsets).

As regards the mobile sector, TIM continued to support the development of 4G and 4.5G ultrabroadband during
2018, achieving important goals - and first and foremost its download speed record in Ookla tests. Important
progress was also made in terms of coverage: at national level, 4G technology has now reached more than 7,300
municipalities, covering over 98% of the population. The company continued the steady roll-out to Italy’s major
cities of 4.5G services (LTE Advanced technology), which offer data connection speeds of up to 700 Megabits
per second.

TIM's technological leadership was confirmed with its acquisition of 5G frequencies, which are fundamental for
the future development of mobile services that can revolutionize the lives of citizens, consumers and businesses
alike, steering the country towards a dimension in which everything is smarter and more connected: from public
safety to transport, from environmental monitoring to health, tourism and culture, and even applications for
media, education and virtual reality. TIM has already run numerous live trials with 5G in Turin, Bari and Matera,
and in the Republic of San Marino, where it has already implemented services for a Smart City, health, tourism
and culture.

Technological leadership means a competitive edge for TIM, which is fundamental for making it mark in a
highly competitive market. By making the most of the distinctive quality of the 4G and 4.5G network, TIM has
been able to continue its “value” strategy and focus on the quality of its offering, maintaining a premium
position on the market.

Another essential aspect of its business strategy in 2018 was customer retention, with the focus on reducing
churn rates and stabilizing customer spending. As part of the campaign, a range of deals was launched (TIM

Report on Operations of the Main Commercial Developments | 34
TIM Group

Special, TIM Young, TIM 60+, TIM International) offering content benefits and subscription discounts for
customers choosing to direct debit the subscription fee from their bank account or credit card. Plus, to increase
awareness and satisfaction, TIM Party was launched - the retention program for all TIM customers that can
only be accessed online.

The program has three levels:

™ extensive benefits for all customers joining the program;

™ specific benefits for clusters selected based on how long customers have been with TIM and the presence of
several TIM services (3Play, 4Play);

™ competitions with prizes.

TIM Party, with its innovative, differentiated format, aims to increase customer retention, the penetration of 3-
4Play services, the digital customer base as well as approval levels.

At the same time, efforts continued to focus on the spread of new smartphones through the offer of premium
content and unique formulas, such as the “NEXT” smartphone renewal deal. TIM was the first to offer this kind
of deal, allowing the customer to replace their smart phone every year at no cost, with extra services such as
protection against damage and theft.

Lastly, during the year the company also continued its segment-based approach, with dedicated value
propositions according to the varying needs of the targets. In particular, for Young customers, initiatives
included targeted music deals and special content offers for customers choosing to direct debit subscription
charges from their bank account or credit card. For the youngest customers (Young Junior), TIM focused on
expanding the content it offers to appeal both to younger children (TIM Games) and parents (TIM Protect, to
control Internet browsing, and tracking services and devices). Finally, for Senior custorners, the company
expanded its offering with targeted features such as dedicated 24/7 telephone assistance and simplified
smartphones.

Business

TIM's work in the Business market during 2018 focused on four main areas:

™ supporting positive growth in the Fixed-line and Mobile customer bases, in keeping with trends in the various
segments (fixed-line, mobile and IT) and gradually increasing revenues;

™ further consolidating the Customer Base retention process with structural action targeting offers as well as
Customer Experience, through a "more for more policy" that makes the most of TIM's profile as an integrated
operator;

™ further consolidating commercial monitoring of the market, above all by increasing the proximity of direct
and indirect sales channels;

™ extending leadership in the ICT market by increasing products targeting “over-the-network” services and
data deals for the large customer segment and through “off-the-shelf” cloud computing solutions for SMEs,
based on a multi-cloud approach.

The main goals of 2018 were protecting the Customer Base and consolidating TIM's position as a national
player that can meet the IT needs of SMEs, large companies and the public administration. These goals were
pursued by maintaining a distinctive product offering and consolidating the commercial front end, which has
also been functional in the gradual migration of the services mix used by customers towards more updated
models based on the extensive adoption of fixed network Fiber/VoIP connectivity, mobile network LTE and Cloud
solutions. Considerable effort has gone into developing the ARPU, through bundle deals and by leveraging
professional services that are distinctive and highly visible.

For the fixed-line network in particular towards the SOHO-SME segment, TIM has further simplified its offering,
focused on Fiber and VoIP solutions. The growth in ARPU and loyalty has been supported by bundle deals for
Unified Communication services (Tim Comunicazione Integrata Smart), together with mobile network and IT
services, delivering major opportunities for end users in terms of efficiency and new business development.
With a view to improving customer care management, new customer segmentation was developed, combining
customer value with technology, and pre-retention actions based on predictive models were stepped up.

For high-end customers, the main new feature was the launch of the first offer of SD-WAN, which gives users
greater flexibility in managing their bandwidth needs. The proposition of cloud computing services was stepped
up further, offering - alongside consolidated VoIP and advanced Collaboration service -the “cloud-on premise”
deal with SIP trunking as part of the TIM Comunicazione Integrata, in synergy with the development of IT
services.

The award of the Consip LAN 6 agreement drove the development of projects in the last part of the year to
update the local connectivity of the public administration sector.

The development of the Information Technology offering focused on leveraging Data Center assets and on the
offer of Security, Communication as a Service and Business Solutions.

Efforts were stepped up, with respect to 2017, to promote the adoption of SPC Cloud Lotto 1 solutions for the
Public Sector, in particular cloud-based laaS, PaaS, SaaS solutions, with important projects being started by
numerous major local public authorities in 2018.

The integration of connectivity deals with public cloud services managed by TIM was exemplified by the launch
of the TIM Safe Web secure DNS deal, integrated with all basic Internet connectivity bundles for the SOHO-SME
segment, protecting over 500,000 customer accesses from over 450 million fraudulent events or IT threats. A
project was set up to develop multi-cloud IT services provided by TIM, through strategic partnerships with leading
providers of IT Cloud over the top services. The IT offering for SMEs continued to be developed with the Digital
Store Market Place featuring around 160 solutions for SMEs, also developed by partners in the TIM Open
environment, using both a horizontal and vertical approach to new e-commerce, e-payment, security, and video
control solutions, to give just a few examples.

In terms of Mobile services, the Mobile Ultra-Broadband service over the LTE and VoLTE networks continued
to be developed in 2018, while also expanding the offering with VAS and IT bundle solutions, with a "more money
for more value" mindset. During the year, the total acquisition of lines went up considerably, despite a
competitive market where the presence of a newcomer was more than offset by the performance in MNP and
M2M acauisitions.

For our high-end customers, alongside contract renegotiations with large customers to defend revenues, the
Tutto Smart offering continued, which provides a bundle of services for smartphones and tablets with All-Risk
Assistance.

Lastly, Olivetti continued to optimize its more "traditional" offering in the office and retail sectors in 2018,
channeling its products into a single business line to transform them from a simple hardware component into a
hub delivering integrated digital solutions (cash registers and multifunction printers in particular). This
optimization also targeted more "innovative" areas of the world of loT, M2M and Big Data. Excellent results in
smart metering and tracking were achieved.

BRAZIL

In 2018, TIM Brazil fully renewed its range of offers to reposition the brand with high-value customers, leveraging
its leadership in the 4G network.

The change in approach had a major impact on the mix of the customer base, mainly in the prepaid segment,
resulting in the progressive and marked migration of customers from single service daily plans (voice and/or
data) to recurring weekly/monthly plans that bundle voice and data packages with other value-added digital
services (music, e-reading and video streaming), all with a view to stabilizing future revenue flows and
proactively managing the ongoing consolidation of the market for second SIMs.

The main sales initiatives included:

™ the launch of a new range of recurring bundle offers (TIM Pre TOP) for the prepaid segment, which offer
comprehensive and differentiated solutions for voice and data services, and packages of unlimited social
networks for a specific period (two weeks);

™ New TIM Controle: TIM Controle with social networks was launched in the third quarter. The offer now
includes unlimited social networks for three months, a 5 GB data package and unlimited calls to any carrier,
costing 49.99 reais per month. The offer was launched through a major media campaign, featuring top
artists with great appeal to the target audience;

™ Fixed: The focus on investing in FTTH (Fiber To The Home) expansion continues, with higher speed offers
and optimal connection stability. TIM began to invest in this type of technology in the fourth quarter of 2017,
closing the fourth quarter of 2018 with the number of households with FTTH available representing 24% of
the total coverage;

™ TIM Casa Internet, which uses WTTX technology to offer residential broadband through the mobile network,
is available in 123 cities.

MAIN CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK

DOMESTIC

In this section we report the main changes in the regulatory framework in 2018 in the Domestic region.

As regards the Antitrust proceedings (A514, 1799 and 1820), as well as the proceedings regarding the 28-day
invoicing, see the Note “Disputes and pending legal actions, other information, commitments and guarantees”
in the TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2018.

Wholesale fixed-line markets

Fixed network access market analysis

On February 20, 2017, AGCom launched the fourth cycle of access market analysis (resolution 43/17/CONS) to
review the obligations and economic terms of wholesale access services for the 2018-2021 period.

The market analyses also take into account TIM's voluntary legal separation project relative to the fixed access
network, notified to AGCom on March 27, 2018.

On January 18, 2019, AGCom put the result of coordinated access market analyses to a public consultation
(resolution 613/18/CONS), proposing the following:

™ confirmation of TIM as operator with significant market power (SMP) on the access market for all of Italy
with the exclusion of Milan, where the regulation was repealed ex ante;

™ positive assessment of the project to separate the TIM access network, but with a limited impact on how
obligations will evolve, as AGCom believes elements of vertical integration still exist (in the project notified
to AGCom, the network company - NetCo - is held 100% by TIM);

™ elimination of the obligation to guide the cost of wholesale prices in municipalities considered "contestable"
(up to 45 in the 1st year with annual update possible, based on developments in alternative infrastructures
and the market); these prices are tested ex ante for replicability;

™ wholesale subscription charges for copper and fiber for 2018 the same as 2017;
™ gradual increase in the full unbundling price (ULL) and bitstream price on copper in the 2019-2021 period;
™ sub loop unbundling (SLU) price stability in the 2019-2021 period;

™ gradual decrease in fiber access prices (VULA FTTC and FTTH) and price differentiation of the bandwidth in
the 2019-2021 period, depending on whether the access line is on a copper or NGA network;

™ repeal of current replicability obligations in public tenders;

™ reduction in times for giving notice of the closure of exchanges whose duration depends on NGA network
coverage (including FWA technology) in the area where the exchange is present;

™ possibility to use vectoring in FTTC cabinets where sub loop unbundling (SLU) is not used by alternative
operators;

™ elimination of current asymmetries in procedures to change operator between processes to return to TIM
and changing from TIM to alternative operators.

It is estimated that AGCom will reach a final decision between June and July 2019, after the deadline for the
national consultation and subsequent opinions issued by the European Commission and AGCM.

Infratel Tenders for the subsidizing of Ultra-broadband networks

On April 4, 2018, Infratel launched a consultation on the public investment plan for “gray areas”. As stated in the
consultation document, the aim of public intervention in gray areas is to support investment projects in networks
able to provide symmetrical 1 Gbps upload and download speeds, thereby delivering step change innovation in
current networks. The consultation process is required by EU regulations governing state aid, before the formal
notification of the plan to the European Commission. State aid measures can only be implemented with the prior
approval of the Commission.

On April 19, 2018, Infratel announced a third call for tenders for contracts worth a total of 103 million euros to
cover the remaining “white areas” of the ultra-broadband network not covered by private service providers, all
located in Calabria, Apulia, and Sardinia. TIM did not make any technical/price proposals. On December 19, 2018,
the contract was awarded to Open Fiber.

Wholesale mobile network markets

Mobile termination market analysis
On January 22, 2018, AGCom published its final decision on mobile network termination market analysis
(resolution 599/18/CONS). AGCom decided to:

™ identify the twelve operators, including lliad, that provide or will provide termination services for voice calls
on the mobile network (MNO and Full MVNO) as operators with significant market power (SMP);

™ confirm use of the cost model indicated in Decision 60/11/CONS to establish termination prices for the 2018-
2021 period, also establishing symmetric rate conditions for all SMP operators (0.98 eurocents in 2018, 0.90
eurocents in 2019, 0.76 eurocents in 2020, 0.67 eurocents in 2021) based on a WACC equal to 8.55%;

™ require price control for the supply of interconnection kits, for all SMP operators, retroactively as from 2018;
™ withdraw the obligation for TIM, Vodafone and WindTre to recognize costs in the accounts;

™ confirm the absence of the obligation to control termination prices for calls originating from outside the
European Economic Area (EEA); however, SMP operators cannot adopt termination rates that are higher
than those applied to Italian operators by operators in non-EEA countries where rates are regulated.

Retail fixed-line markets

Universal Service

In May 2018, TIM challenged the Lazio Regional Administrative Court ruling that dismissed TIM’s appeal against
Resolution 456/16/CONS with the Council of State. In that decision, AGCom rejected TIM’s proposal for a price
adjustment to “voice” offers (basic voice telephone service) and introduced a strict procedure for future
variations in Universal Service prices.

On June 15, 2018, AGCom Resolution 88/18/CIR accepted that all operators should contribute to the net cost of
the universal service for 2009, for a total of 11.61 million euros, of which 5.6 million euros payable by Other
Operators. In relation to 2008, AGCom also accepted the existence of a cost, the amount of which, however,
does not justify the activation of the contribution mechanism.

Following the conclusion of assessment activities to review the net cost of Universal Service for the years 2006
and 2007, which resulted in Decision 145/17/CONS, on July 3, 2018, AGCom Decision 89/18 /CIR launched a public
consultation process on the applicability of the mechanism for distributing and assessing the net cost of the
Universal Service for those years, which ended on November 15.

Authority fees

AGCom contribution fee

In March 2018, TIM conditionally paid an amount of 18.5 million euros for the 2018 AGCom contribution fee. The
amount was calculated by applying a rate of 0.00135 to the revenues posted in the Company’s 2016 Financial
Statements, as required by the guidelines set out in AGCom Decision 426/17/CONS.

Privacy and personal data protection

General Data Protection Regulation

On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 - “GDPR”) came into
force. The GDPR is directly applicable in all Member States of the European Union, superseding, in Italy, the
provisions of the Data Protection Code that are incompatible with the new regulation.

To ensure the compliance of personal data processing with the GDPR within Group companies, TIM carried out
the activities envisaged in the adjustment plan by the May 25, 2018 deadline, involving almost all relevant TIM
departments and Group Companies for around 18 months. In particular the activities carried out led to:

™ the appointment of the Data Protection Officer and the setting up of related touch points for data subjects
in relation to the processing of their data;

™ the appointment of internal Privacy Officers, employees with specific duties and instructions to assist the
Company’s senior management in implementing their obligations;

™ the updating and issuing of numerous policies and procedures, including those defining the obligations in
relation to data breaches (extended to all types of personal data), privacy impact assessments (for
processing high privacy risk data), customer profiling, data subject rights request management;

™ the adjustment of the TIM compliance catalog to render it compliant with the processing activity register;

Report on Operations of the Main changes in the regulatory framework | 38
TIM Group


--- Page 32 ---

™ the updating of the numerous disclosures on personal data processing, provided by TIM and other Group
companies to the various types of data subjects (e.g. customers, employees, visitors);

™ the revision of procedures in the event of the assignment of activities to third parties (e.g. suppliers and
business partners) to ensure compliance with the legislation.

A specific training project was then designed to raise awareness in the various company departments and to
illustrate the policies and procedures in place for the application of the GDPR. Eight training courses involving
around 600 TIM and Group company employees were held.

Further training initiatives related to privacy were aimed at personnel moving to commercial departments, to
ensure correct understanding and application of privacy obligations in relation to sales and telemarketing
activities, as well as at personnel overseeing the execution of obligatory services for the judiciary.

BRAZIL

Revision of the model for the provision of telecommunications services

In April 2016, the working group composed of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and
Communications (MCTIC) and Anatel published its final report with a “diagnosis” on the telecommunications
industry and proposed guidelines for the revision of the Brazilian regulatory model. A bill (PLC 79/2016) was then
presented to the National Congress of Brazil to propose amendments to the General Telecommunications Law.
Although the bill was passed by both chambers of Congress, the opposition challenged the legislative procedure
followed in the Supreme Court, where the bill remained blocked for months. At the beginning of October 2017,
the bill PLC 79/2016 was referred back to the Senate pending voting. Its approval is expected to be held over the
course of 2019.

In October and November 2017, the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC)
held a public consultation to review the general telecommunications policy proposing the setting of guidelines
and objectives for the provision of telecommunications services, for the technological development of digital
services and broadband infrastructure, and for the spread of “smart cities”. The Public Consultation was
memorialized in Decree 9,612/2018 (“Connectivity Plan”) and established a series of guidelines for
implementation of the new rules of conduct, paid granting of spectrum authorization and regulatory acts in
general, including; (i) expansion of high capacity telecommunications transport networks; (ii) increased coverage
of mobile broadband access networks; and (iii) broadening the coverage of fixed broadband access network in
areas with no Internet access offer through this type of infrastructure. It also establishes that the implemented
network will be subject to sharing from its entry into operation, except when there is appropriate competition in
the respective relevant market.

In relation to the deadlines for the upgrading of pipelines not compliant with current regulations, authorizations
for user licenses to radio frequencies, and the introduction of other statutory provisions generally, planned
investments (as identified by Anatel and approved by the MCTIC) will focus primarily on the expansion of mobile
and fixed-line broadband networks and on specific areas of the country. TLC networks built under the investment
plan will have shared access.

Revision of Competition Rules

In November 2012, the Brazilian regulator Anatel introduced instruments for the market analysis, the
identification of operators with significant market power (SMP) and the consequent imposition of ex-ante
obligations (Plano Geral de Metas de Competigao - PGMC).

Anatel has established a number of asymmetrical obligations on all markets for operators with a Significant
Market Power (SMP).

In July 2018, Anatel published the new PGMC revising some points and defining two new markets: (i)
interconnection for mobile services; and (ii) high capacity data transmission.

TIM Brasil has been identified as the SMP operator for: (i) mobile network terminals; (ii) national roaming; and
(iii) high capacity data transport (in five municipalities).

Report on Operations of the Main changes in the regulatory framework | 39
TIM Group


--- Page 33 ---

The measures adopted for the SMP operator on these markets include:

™  areduction in mobile termination rates based on a price cap system and partially maintaining a Bill & Keep
mechanism, until the next review of the PGMC;

™ the obligation for non-SMP operators to offer national roaming services.

The obligation for vertically integrated landline operators with an SMP to access the copper network (e.g.: leased
lines, bitstream and full unbundling) was maintained.

With the new PGMC, alternative operators may not apply asymmetrical interconnection rates above 20% the

rate applied by incumbent operators. Since 2016, fixed interconnection rates have been based on a cost-oriented
approach.

700 MHz and Analog TV switch off

In September 2014, TIM won the tender for the award of the 700 MHz (4G/LTE) band frequencies, for a price of
1.7 billion reais, and with additional commitments of 1.2 billion reais (in four annual installments, adjusted for
inflation) as a contribution to the consortium established by the tender (“EAD”) for all the operators (TIM, Algar,
Claro and Vivo) awarded the contract for managing the freeing up of the 700 MHz band through the switch off
of analog TV, the redistribution of channels and the clean-up of interference. To that end, the first payment (370
million reais) was made in April 2015 and another two payments (for a total of 860 million reais) were both made
in January 2017, while the final installment (142 million reais) was duly paid in January 2018.

Since 2016, the spectrum has been freed up for mobile operations in 4,467 municipalities and all Brazilian capitals
already have the mobile service in 4G technology, operating in the range. These municipalities cover
approximately 85% of the Brazilian population. Currently about 2,620 cities are in operation and 1,379 cities were
shut down. By 2019, the schedule for completion of the remaining 1,103 cities remains.

"Marco Civil da Internet" and Network Neutrality

The “Marco Civil da Internet” (MCI), approved in April 2014 by Brazilian Law No. 12,965/2014, defined network
neutrality as the “duty to treat different data packages in the same way, without distinction based on content,
origin and destination, service, terminal or application”. On May 11, 2016, Brazilian Presidential Decree No.
8,771/2016 was published, which regulates exceptions to the principle of net neutrality, set out in article 9 of the
mentioned law.

In August 2017, the oversight board (“GS”) of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) handed
down a decision in favor of Brazil’s mobile TLC providers, which excluded the imposition of fines in relation to a
preliminary investigation into alleged unfair competition in “zero rating” offers and promotions on Internet data
consumption. The oversight board heard the depositions of various parties, including the Ministry of Science,
Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) and Anatel, and concluded that Internet business models
should not be banned ex-ante, but instead should be monitored comprehensively to prevent any unfair
competition outcomes.

Strategic Digital Transformation and the Internet of Things

Between December 15, 2016 and February 5, 2017, the MCTIC conducted a public consultation process to discuss
the public procedure for solutions enabling Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (loT) services for
the Brazilian market. The final consultation report was published in November, with the objective of addressing
regulatory and tax matters, as well as aspects of public procedure, investment, and education issues. A decree
outlining a national loT plan is expected to be published in 2019.

In August and September 2017, the MCTIC conducted a public consultation process on Digital Transformation
Strategy (E-Digital), with the aim of widening discussion and creating strategies for the digitization of the
Brazilian economy. An E-Digital Decree (9319/2018) has now been published, identifying around 100 strategic
actions aimed at boosting competition and on-line productivity levels in the country, while raising connectivity
and digital inclusion levels. The actions seek to address the main strategic issues for the digital economy,
including connectivity infrastructure, the use and protection of data, loT, and cyber-security.

In July 2018, Anatel also requested funding for a Public Consultation on future loT regulation and a reduction in
entry barriers to expand loT. The main issues addressed by Anatel were: (i) the need for a license; (ii) use of the
spectrum; (iii) quality and consumer protection; (iv) taxes. The Public Consultation is expected to be held in 2019.

Data protection

On August 14, 2018, the Brazilian President promulgated the General Data Protection Law (Law 13,709/2018).
The new law, as promulgated by the President, is closer to the GDPR, including significant extra-territorial
application and considerable fines of up to 2% of the Company's global turnover of the previous financial year.

In December 2018, Provisional Measure 869/2018 passed by the former President amended Law 13,709 to create
the National Data Protection Authority, within the structure of the Presidency of the Republic, which implies
greater control by the State and, among other topics, extending the entry into force of the Law to 24 months.
By this date all legal entities will be required to adapt their data processing activities to these new rules.

COMPETITION

DOMESTIC

The market

During 2018, the Italian TLC market was affected by a downturn in value due to tougher competition in the
mobile sector.

The expansion of broadband and ultra-broadband has been the main driver of market growth, helping to open
up new opportunities for telecommunications providers to develop convergent offers that bundle together TLC
services with Media & Entertainment services, IT services and Digital services.

The Italian telecommunications market has always been highly competitive; in particular core competition with
other operators in the sector is still the factor that has the greatest impact on market trends.
Telecommunications operators must also face the challenges from Over the Tops (OTT) and device
manufacturers, that operate in the new digital world using completely different assets and competitive
strategies to TLC players.

The traditional business models of the various market players are, therefore, changing to exploit new
opportunities and meet the challenges posed by the new entrants:

™ in the Media & Entertainment segment, as the web takes on growing importance as a complementary
distribution platform, OTTs, telecommunications providers and consumer electronics manufacturers are
acquiring an increasingly major role;

™ in the Information Technology market, the decline in traditional revenues is driving the various players
towards cloud computing, with the goal of protecting their core business. Telecommunications providers are
strengthening in this sector, including through partnerships;

™ Consumer Electronics manufacturers are developing services that can be accessed through the Internet by

leveraging handset ownership and user experience management, breaking the relationship between
customers and TLC providers;

™  OTTs have, for some time now, been leading the transformation in how TLC services are used (including
voice services), increasingly integrating them with Media & Entertainment, IT and new Digital services.

With regard to the current positioning of telecommunications providers in converging markets, on the other
hand, as partially described above, the following is taking place with different levels of progress:

™ development of new Media & Entertainment services (TV, Music, Gaming) and new Digital services (Smart
Home, Digital Advertising, Mobile Payment-Digital Identity);

™ development of Innovative Services in the IT market, particularly Cloud services.

During 2018, the bidding for the award of frequencies for 5G services took place, which led, following various

higher bids, to an overall outlay for telecommunications companies of over 6.5 billion euros, well above the

minimum bid price:

™ TIM and Vodafone were awarded the biggest part of the spectrum, 10+10 MHz at 700 MHz, 80 MHz in the
3.6-3.8 GHz band respectively (the most requested to launch good-quality 5G services) and 200 MHz in the
27 GHz band, consolidating their competitive positioning in terms of bandwidth owned and quality of service
offered;

= WindTre was limited to acquiring a 20 MHz part at 3.6-3.8 GHz and a 200 MHz part in the 27GHz band;

= |liad was awarded the 10+10 MHz to 700 MHz part, reserved for a new entry operator, a 20 MHz to 3.6-3.8
GHz part and a 200 MHz to 27 GHz part;

™  Fastweb was awarded a 200 MHz to 27 GHz part.

Based on performance capabilities in terms of speed, latency and number of connected devices, 5G is a great
opportunity for telecommunications companies with the necessary bandwidth to open new vertical markets
(automotive, smart agriculture, logistics, cloud robotics), provide new services, start up new production
processes and increase the efficiency of optimized product management.

Competition in Fixed-line Telecommunications

The fixed-line telecommunications market has continued to see a decline in access and voice revenues, while
broadband and ultra-broadband revenues have shown continuous growth. In recent years, service providers
have concentrated mainly on expanding the penetration of broadband and ultra-broadband services and

Report on Operations of the Competition | 42
TIM Group


--- Page 36 ---

defending Voice revenues by introducing bundled voice, broadband and service deals in a highly competitive
environment with consequent pricing pressure.

Deals and offers are also becoming more competitive thanks to the consolidation, among competitors, of an
approach based on control over infrastructure (above all, Local Loop Unbundling (LLU), as well as Fiber to the
Cabinet (FTTC) networks). The main fixed-line service providers are also offering mobile services, also as Mobile
Virtual Operators (MVOs).

As concerns competition in infrastructure, two providers - Open Fiber (an ENEL Group company) and Infratel
(controlled by the Ministry of Economic Development) - presented plans for the development of their own optic
fiber networks as alternatives to the TIM network, which respectively target major Italian cities and areas of
market failure.

For major cities, Open Fiber announced a plan for the development of Fiber to the Home (FTTH) connections in
271 large Italian towns by 2022, reaching around 9.6 million homes through an investment of 3.8 billion euros.
After obtaining 3.5 billion euros of funding in July 2018, the development of the Open Fiber network was stepped
up considerably, opening up to 71 Italian towns (as of January 2019), including many major Italian cities, such as
Milan, Turin and Bologna, where "Metroweb" (acquired in December 2016) had previously expanded, besides
other cities such as Bari, Cagliari, Catania, Naples, Padova, Perugia, Venice, Genoa, Palermo and Florence, and
other smaller towns that are mainly satellite areas of Milan, Turin and Bologna.

In the meantime, according to media reports, main competitors in the TLC retail market have signed an
agreement with Open Fiber to link their new ultra-broadband (UBB) customers onto its network, where available.

As concerns areas of market failure - the so-called “white areas” in the C and D clusters of the government’s
Ultra-Broadband Plan - Infratel held three public calls for tenders over the last three years for the development
of a UBB network to deliver services to around 7,500 municipalities across 19 regions.

™ Inthe first call for tenders, Open Fiber won all five of the lots offered in the six regions involved (Lombardy,
Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Tuscany, Abruzzo and Molise), covering around 3,000 municipalities;

™ inthe second call for tenders, Open Fiber won all six of the lots offered in the ten regions involved (Piedmont,
Valle d'Aosta, Liguria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, the Autonomous Province of Trento, Marche, Umbria, Lazio,
Campania, Basilicata and Sicily), covering around 3,700 municipalities;

™ in the third call for tenders, Open Fiber won all three lots in the three regions involved (Apulia, Calabria and
Sardinia) covering around 880 municipalities.

In January 2019, there were nearly 1,174 work sites open for the first two Infratel/Open Fiber contracts, of which
977 for fiber optic connections and 197 for wireless connections (FWA).

Therefore the development of Open Fiber Plans - both in major Italian cities and market failure areas - will drive
a significant shift in infrastructure competition, with the development of various competitive dynamics
depending on the overlap and reach of available ultrabroadband infrastructure:

= areas with two FTTH networks overlapping FTTC networks;

= areas with a single FTTH network overlapping FTTC networks;
= areas with FTTH networks overlapping ADSL networks;

= areas with FTTC networks overlapping ADSL networks.

Competition in the Italian fixed-line telecommunications market is also characterized by the presence of other
service providers besides TIM, such as Wind-Infostrada, Fastweb, Vodafone, and Tiscali, which have business
models focused on different segments of the market.

In December 2018, fixed accesses in Italy were estimated to be around 20.3 million (including OLO
Infrastructured and FWA-Fixed Wireless Accesses) down slightly on the previous year. Competition in the access
market led to a gradual reduction in TIM's market share.

As concerns the Broadband market, at December 31, 2018, the number of fixed-line broadband customers in
Italy (including both broadband and Ultra-broadband customers) was estimated to have reached a penetration
rate of approximately 86% of all fixed-line accesses. The spread of broadband continues to be driven by the
penetration of computers and other enabling devices (such as Smart TVs), but also by growing demand for fast
connections and access to new over-IP services that are becoming increasingly widespread (Media &
Entertainment, IT and Digital services).

Competition in Mobile Telecommunications

The mobile market has continued to see the rationalization of second and third SIM cards for human
communications, while sales of SIM cards for machine to machine (M2M) communications are growing.

Report on Operations of the Competition | 43
TIM Group


--- Page 37 ---

Moreover, growth in mobile broadband customers has continued thanks to the high penetration rate of LTE on
mobile lines, especially as a result of the increasing spread of smartphones.

Alongside innovative services that have already caught on and are under full-scale development, as in the case
of mobile apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of mobile broadband,
with major potential for growth in the medium term, such as the Internet of Things and mobile payment.

The competitive scenario on the Italian mobile telecommunications market in 2018 was marked by the entry of
the French operator Illiad, that launched its own service in May, becoming the fourth infrastructured operator in
Italy, alongside TIM, Vodafone and WindTre.

With a particularly aggressive price and data volume offering, Illiad has rapidly won over customers and
consequently gained a market share to the detriment of other infrastructured operators, mainly WindTre and
Vodafone, while TIM has shown a greater resilience, thanks also to the contribution from the second brand virtual
operator, Kena Mobile, launched during 2017. To best respond to the competitive threat of Illiad, Vodafone also
launched its own low-cost operator in June 2018, with the ho.mobile brand.

At the same time, mobile virtual operators (MVO), of which PosteMobile is the most important player, also
reported a growth trend, taking market share away from infrastructured operators.

This tougher competition following Illiad's entry to the market resulted in a new drop in the spend on services,
after several years of relative stability.

BRAZIL

Macroeconomic trends witnessed in the last quarter of 2018 confirm a recovery scenario expected for 2019,
although forecasts for 2018 have been progressively decreased throughout the year, especially due to political
uncertainty regarding the election process. Thus, main scenario is still a slow economic recovery scenario, after
a severe recession notably during 2015-16 period. Unemployment has been falling slowly, while inflation
returned to a more contained level (below 4% for 2018).

Although some political uncertainty still exists, especially regarding the ability of the new government to fulfill
the economic liberal agenda promised during the election process, the market has acknowledged such liberal
guidelines presented so far as a pro-business agenda, in the form of a recent hike in the Brazilian stock market
(Bovespa +18% from September 30, 2018 until January 15, 2019) and currency appreciation (BRL +8.4% over the
same period).

Despite improving financial indicators (such as stock market and currency ratio), economic conditions are still
challenging, as budget deficit and growing debts (for central government, Federal States and municipalities)
present a risk that can only be addressed by structural reforms that need the congress approval. Present
government acknowledges that need and put reforms as a top priority for the first months of the government
to put the economy growing consistently for the coming years.

The mobile telecommunications sector has seen some rationality prevail in the market and in competition, with
service providers remaining focused on the development of the characteristics and service range of their
commercial offers, rather than pursuing aggressive pricing policies, especially for the first half of 2018.

In the Prepaid segment, the main objective of market players has been to raise recurrence rates on the use of
services by leveraging the ongoing SIM card consolidation process in the market, by encouraging migration to
weekly (and monthly) plans or hybrid plans (Controle postpaid) by offering a range of bundled service packages
to meet different needs of customers (unlimited voice calls or data packages). The aim of the strategy is to
improve the mix of the customer base and ensure greater stability (reducing churn rates) and growth in ARPU.
The prepaid base has grown 12.3% YoY (up to November 2018, last data available).

In the Postpaid mobile segment, growth in the customer base was driven primarily by the hybrid Controle
segment (in particular by the migration of Prepaid customers), even though “pure” Postpaid lines also registered
a certain growth based on offer segmentation strategies that introduce distinctions in the use of data services
(for example the unlimited use of data for specific apps, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, etc.), as part of a
“More for More” sales policy that is bringing greater price stability and effectively repositioning the customer
base towards higher value deals (voice + data + content). The postpaid base grew by +13.2% YoY (up to
November 2018, last data available).

Service quality is still an element of differentiation. Telecommunication providers that have invested more in
the development of 4G networks (coverage and capacity) and in the improvement of processes shaping
customers’ experience will have a greater ability to apply premium prices, as customers raise their expectations
and place growing importance on the quality of data services and higher value content.

The fixed-line broadband market posted growth of approximately 8.5% in 2018 (up to November 2018, last data
available), driven mainly by smaller market players, which tend to offer better download speeds and/or are in
areas in which incumbents have limited infrastructure. Penetration rates across the population are still quite low
(approximately 43% of households) when compared to several other countries, which means there are good
opportunities for medium-term growth, underpinned by the improving macroeconomic situation.

In this context, since 2017, TIM Brasil adopted a business strategy for TIM Live to leverage its fiber network
infrastructure, offering ultra broadband Internet services, through FTTC and notably FTTH, not only in some of
the largest cities of Brazil, but also in cities where opportunities arise for such high-quality service. Therefore, TIM
Live has expanded to cover 12 cities by the end of 2018, and this is expected to grow even more in the following
years. TIM Live service not only offers very fast Internet connections, but it is also acknowledged as the best fixed
Internet service in Brazil by Netflix, and customer satisfaction rates rank among the best for the service in the
country. For smaller cities, TIM has launched its WTTx service, which delivers broadband services through the
LTE mobile network, leveraging TIM’s leading 4G coverage to address increasing demand for residential
broadband, especially in areas with poor fixed infrastructure by local incumbent.

With the introduction of IFRS 15, Mobile customer acquisition costs, relating to contracts with minimum-duration
lock-in clauses, are no longer capitalized and depreciated. Instead they are classified as “deferred contract costs”
and subsequently recognized in the income statement over the term of the contract.

On the same accounting basis, capital expenditures in 2018 totaled 6,558 million euros (5,701 million euros in
2017).

In particular:

= the Domestic Business Unit reported expenditures equal to 5,634 million euros (4,551 million euros in 2017).
Net of the acquisition of rights to use 5G frequencies (2,399 million euros) at the end of 2018 and the renewal
of the GSM license in 2017 (630 million euros), capital expenditures were down by 686 million euros, mainly
attributable to the coverage levels of fixed and mobile networks already achieved;

= the Brazil Business Unit posted 924 million euros of capex in 2018, 226 million euros less than for 2017.
Without the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates (-187 million euros), the change was a negative 39
million euros. Capital expenditures of the Business Unit were targeted primarily at strengthening mobile
ultra-broadband network infrastructure and developing the fixed broadband business of TIM Live.

Change in net operating working capital

The positive change in net operating working capital of 1,194 million euros (negative for 126 million euros in 2017)
was mainly related to higher operating payables (1,922 million euros) following the acquisition of rights to use
mobile telephone frequencies in Italy (5G): in 2018 TIM made the first payment tranche, for an amount of
approximately 480 million euros, the remaining tranches, as established by the Italian government in the 2017
budget law, will be due for payment based on pre-established quotas between 2019 and 2022.

Change in employee benefits

In 2018, the change amounted to -208 million euros and mainly refers to uses for staff leaving the company,
already allocated in previous years and the change in the provision for non-executive personnel affected by the
application of Article 4(1-7ter) of Italian Law 92 of June 28, 2012, the "Fornero Law", following the higher number
of staff leaving in 2018 and the consequent revised estimate of staff leaving for the years 2019-2020, also taking
into account the social security changes made by Decree Law 4 of January 28, 2019.

In 2017, the change in employee benefits was affected mainly by the allocation of 689 million euros of provisions
for non-recurring expenses, offset by drawdowns totaling 177 million euros in relation to restructuring plans
previously in place.

Sale of investments and other disposals flow

This item shows a positive figure of 18 million euros and mainly refers to disposals of assets within the normal
operating cycle.

In 2017, the item posted a positive balance of 33 million euros, mainly reflecting the disposal of 17 million euros
of tangible assets and the collection of a deferred 13 million euros of the sale price of a non-controlling interest
sold in previous years.

Share capital increases/reimbursements, including incidental costs

These totaled 22 million euros in 2018 and essentially consisted of contributions from an external shareholder
of the Group for new capital issued by a subsidiary (16 million euros in 2017).

Increase in finance leasing contracts

In 2018, this item was equal to 70 million euros (68 million euros in 2017) and mainly refers to the higher value
of finance lease assets and related higher financial payables recognized mainly following the recognition of
vehicle lease agreements as finance leases, in accordance with IAS 17, for the Domestic Business Unit.

Finance expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating
requirements flow

The item shows a net requirement of 1,747 million euros in total, mainly driven by the payment flows, in 2018, of
outflows connected to components of financial income and expense, and the change in non-operating payables
and receivables, as well as the lower financial debt payable for property leases, under the revised estimated life
of leases renegotiated under the real estate restructuring and rationalization plan underway (215 million euros).

Sales of receivables to factoring companies

As regards the reduction of adjusted net financial debt by 38 million euros, we report that sales without recourse
of trade receivables to factoring companies completed during 2018 resulted in a positive effect on adjusted net
financial debt at December 31, 2018 of 2,004 million euros (2,000 million euros at December 31, 2017).

The financial risk management policies of the TIM Group are aimed at minimizing market risks, fully hedging
exchange rate risk, and optimizing interest rate exposure through appropriate diversification of the portfolio,
which is also achieved by using carefully selected derivative financial instruments. Such instruments, it should
be stressed, are not used for speculative purposes and all have an underlying, which is hedged.

In addition, to determine its exposure to interest rates, the Group sets an optimum composition for the fixed-
rate and variable-rate debt structure and uses derivative financial instruments to achieve that composition.
Taking into account the Group's operating activities, the optimum mix of medium/long-term non-current
financial liabilities has been established, on the basis of the nominal amount, at a range of 65%-75% for the
fixed-rate component and 25%-35% for the variable-rate component.

In managing market risks, the Group has adopted Guidelines for the "Management and control of financial risk"
and mainly uses IRS and CCIRS derivative financial instruments.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual
indicator (renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure called “Adjusted
net financial debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial markets. Given that some
components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the exchange and interest rate
for contractual flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result in actual
monetary settlement, the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these purely accounting and non-monetary

effects (including the effects of IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement) from the measurement of derivatives and
related financial assets/liabilities.

Maturities of financial liabilities and average cost of debt

The average maturity of non-current financial liabilities (including the current portion of medium/long-term
financial liabilities due within 12 months) was 7.62 years.

The average cost of the Group’s debt, considered as the cost for the year calculated on an annual basis and
resulting from the ratio of debt-related expenses to average exposure, stood at approximately 4.4%.

For details on the maturities of financial liabilities in terms of expected nominal repayment amounts, as
contractually agreed, see the Notes “Financial liabilities (non-current and current)” in the Consolidated Financial
Statements at December 31, 2018 of the TIM Group.

Current financial assets and liquidity margin
The TIM Group’s available liquidity margin amounted to 8,043 million euros, equal to the sum of:

™ “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Current securities other than investments” totaling 3,043 million euros
(4,568 million euros at December 31, 2017), also included 545 million euros of repurchase agreements, of
which 450 million euros maturing in January 2019 and the remaining portion maturing in March 2019;

™ the new Revolving Credit Facility opened in January 2018 for 5,000 million euros.

This margin is sufficient to cover Group financial liabilities falling due over the next 24-36 months.

In particular:

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to 1,917 million euros (3,575 million euros at December 31, 2017). The
different technical forms of investing available cash can be analyzed as follows:

=~ Maturities: investments have a maximum maturity of three months;

™ Counterparty risk: investments by the European companies are made with leading banking, financial and
industrial institutions with high credit quality. Investments by the companies in South America are made
with leading local counterparties;

™ Country risk: deposits have been made mainly in major European financial markets.

Current securities other than investments amounted to 1,126 million euros (993 million euros at December 31,
2017): These forms of investment represent alternatives to the investment of liquidity with the aim of improving
returns. They included a total of 558 million euros of Italian treasury bonds purchased by TIM S.p.A. (252 million
euros), Telecom Italia Finance S.A. (296 million euros) and Inwit S.p.A. (10 million euros), as well as 387 million
euros of bonds purchased by Telecom Italia Finance S.A. with different maturities, all with an active market and
consequently readily convertible into cash, and 181 million euros of investments in monetary funds by the Brazil
Business Unit. The purchases of the above government bonds, which, pursuant to Consob Communication no.
DEM/11070007 of August 5, 2011, represent investments in “Sovereign debt securities”, have been made in
accordance with the Guidelines for the "Management and control of financial risk" adopted by the TIM Group
since August 2012.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted net financial debt increased by 80 million euros compared to September
30, 2018 (25,190 million euros): income tax payments and the payment of 477 million euros relative to the portion
of the award amount due for 2018 for rights to use the 3700-3800 MHZ and 26.5-27.5 GHZ (5G) frequencies
basically offset the positive cash generation from operations and financing activities.

CONSOLIDATED DATA - TABLES OF DETAIL

The TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements for 2018 and the comparative figures for the previous year have
been prepared in accordance with the International Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board and endorsed by the European Union (“IFRS”).

The accounting and consolidation policies adopted are consistent with those applied for the TIM Group Consolidated
Financial Statements at December 31, 2017, except for the new standards adopted as of January 1, 2018, the impact
of which is illustrated in the Note “Accounting Policies - Adoption of the New IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 Standards”, to which
readers are referred for more details.

The TIM Group, in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS, uses certain
alternative performance measures in order to present a better understanding of the trend of operations and financial
condition. Specifically, these alternative performance measures refer to: EBITDA; EBIT; the organic change in
revenues, EBITDA and EBIT; EBITDA margin and EBIT margin; and net financial debt carrying amount and adjusted
net financial debt.

Moreover, the part entitled "Business Outlook for the year 2019" contains forward-looking statements in relation to
the Group's intentions, beliefs or current expectations regarding financial performance and other aspects of the
Group's operations and strategies. Readers of the Annual Report are reminded not to place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements; actual results may differ significantly from forecasts owing to numerous factors, the
majority of which are beyond the scope of the Group's control.

MAIN CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

There were no significant changes in the scope of consolidation in 2018 and in 2017.

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
OPERATIONS AND THEIR ECONOMIC ASPECTS

Environmental and social changes underway pose economic risks, but also business opportunities for TIM, that
has a leading role in the economy of the main countries where it operates; In an increasingly digital world, the
ability to find a sustainable dimension among the new business models, new service classes, new operating
procedures and new professional dimensions that are transforming the way we live and work and reshaping
systems and economic relations is of strategic importance.

The analysis process conducted in 2018, in order to identify material issues relative to the social, environmental
and economic impacts business activities have both in and outside the Company, showed that opportunities
related to the digital transformation of companies, the public administration and citizens' services are material
issues for the Group. The analysis also showed how essential it was for TIM to play a lead role in developing
digital expertise and knowledge in its own dimension and in a capacity as enabler for a new digital society. There
has also been a renewed focus on human rights, in all forms, and on environmental issues, such as reducing
greenhouse gases, which the Group can contribute to with products that enable businesses and households to
reduce their energy consumption, and with services to help cities lower their own emissions.

The following are a few cases in which social and environmental elements have direct economic impacts on TIM
and, lastly, a description is provided of the materiality analysis, the details of which are provided in the Group’s
Sustainability Report/Disclosure of non-financial information.

IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS -
REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION

TIM is one of the biggest electricity users nationally, consuming around 1.87! TWh of energy per year.
Technological developments continued in 2018, related mainly to the NGAN (Next Generation Access Network)
implementation plan and LTE technology, are generally leading to an increase in energy consumption. 2018 in
particular saw a significant boost given to the technological development of the fixed-line and mobile network
and significant growth in new installations in the internal and external market in the field of Information
Technology, with a consequent increase in energy demand.

TIM pro-actively managed to offset its energy consumption related to technological development, through
continual research into efficiency and the optimization of solutions adopted, achieving:

™ net total decrease in energy consumption in 2018 of the Domestic Business Unit approximately 28 GWh
compared to 2017;

™ an increase in own production of electricity through the co-generation and tri-generation of approximately
25 GWh by the Domestic Business Unit in 2018, compared to the previous year, for an output of around 132
GWh, thanks to optimized plant operation.

In economic terms, the overall savings of the Domestic Business Unit from the reduction in consumption and
own energy produced can be estimated to be approximately 7.3 million euros over the course of the year.

During the year, TIM maintained ISO 50001 certification for sites covered by the Energy Management System. In
2018, certification was extended considerably: besides the "historic" site in Bologna, in via Stendhal and the Data
Center in Rozzano 1 and 2, certification was also obtained for Rozzano 3 - thus completing the entire Data Center
at Rozzano - and for the exchange in the center of Piacenza, as well as the Data Processing Centers at Padova
and Bologna Roveri. TIM therefore achieved the objective it had set the previous year to add an exchange to the
certification on top of the already certified buildings. The energy efficiency of TIM was also recognized through
the awarding of Energy Efficiency Certificates (EEC, also known as White Certificates): During 2018, 18,000 EECs
were awarded, sold with revenues equal to approximately 6 million euros. As proof of its commitment to energy,
TIM received the 2018 Energy Manager award for the tertiary sector from FIRE (the Italian Federation for a
Rational Use of Energy) in association with ENEA and Key Energy.

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROCESS, SOCIAL COST
OPTIMIZATION - ENGAGEMENT WITH WORKERS'
REPRESENTATIVES

TIM pays much attention to listening and involving workers' representatives in many areas of work, including
reorganization processes.

The search for constant dialog and discussion with union representatives led to major agreements being
reached, aimed at reconciling the needs of the business with those of the people who work in the company. This
has allowed agreements to be reached for the implementation of efficiency improvement plans that can
mediate between the needs of the workers and those of the company. For example, a complex negotiation
process involving the leading trade union organizations was completed in late 2015 with the signing of a
framework agreement to manage staff redundancies.

Like its predecessors, the agreement provided for the use of a mixture of integrated instruments and measures
that are not socially traumatic but that are economically sustainable:

™ these include the use in 2016-2017 of Defensive Solidarity Contracts, as required by the Jobs Act, extended
up to June 2019, combined with the strategic role of the training lever, as a pivotal element to encourage
professional retraining and requalification in order to counteract redundancies. Defensive Solidarity
Contracts are agreements that provide for working hours to be reduced in order to avoid downsizing. For the
workers to whom the contract will be applied, provision is made for INPS (Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza
Sociale) to make up part of the remuneration not received due to the reduction in working hours. In 2018,
the benefit on the cost of labor obtained from solidarity contracts was 81 million euros for the Group (117
million euros in 2017), all relating to the Parent Company;

™ redundancy in accordance with Law 223/91 and Article 4 of the so-called “Fornero Law”*, with participation
ona voluntary basis.

GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

ICT services for environmental protection and improving citizens' quality of life are seeing positive growth rates.
TIM customers already have a range of solutions available to them to cut energy consumption, reduce red tape,
and increase security for citizens.

TIM's services for the environment (described on timbusiness.it) include:

™ TIM ENERGREEN, the energy management service platform which allows businesses and public
organizations to monitor their consumption and manage it efficiently and effectively through locally placed
sensors. Energy saving can be estimated to be approximately 10% only as regards the adoption of metering
& reporting functions. For TIM ENERGREEN alone, sales in 2018 amounted to approximately one million
euros, increasing by 30% over 2017;

™  videoconferencing solutions, a market which is extremely dynamic, reported a turnover of approximately 11
million in 2018. Available in different commercial formulations, suitable for the requirements of small,
medium and large companies, with service levels and quality standards ranging from High Definition to
telepresence, videoconferencing services reduce the amount of travel, and therefore CO. Web-based
solutions in particular are increasing both the availability of videoconferencing services among SMEs and
their penetration among larger companies, contributing to reducing emissions;

™ vertical solutions - from telemedicine to smart agriculture - are also available on the market, directly or
indirectly contributing to reducing consumption and emissions by optimizing and improving the efficiency of
activities.

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

As already stated, in compliance with Italian Legislative Degree 254/2016 and the requirements of the Global
Reporting Initiative Standards, TIM conducted a materiality analysis in 2018 with the aim of identifying material
topics as regards the socio-environmental and economic impacts of its business activities both within and
outside the company.

Process to identify the material topics

In keeping with the methodology started in 2017, TIM assessed the validity of the material issues identified the
previous year, adopting evolved semantic analysis techniques, to analyze a larger number of information sources
in order to identify and map sector topics, and also continued its analysis of big data, in order to collect external
points of view.

The taxonomy® to adopt in the semantic engine was updated, using the same sustainability and digital
references as those in 2017, in more recent versions and expanding the number. In particular:

™ = Global Reporting Initiative Standard, ISO 26000, Sustainable Development Goals and _ specialist
assessments®;

™ Italian Digital Agenda, Objectives of the European Digital Single Market and dedicated indexes,’ besides
regulatory references which are relevant for TIM and its stakeholders.

The semantic engine analyzed all the national and international sources of information, public and non-public
sources, internal and external to TIM8 with different interactions leading to the definition of a list of topics based
on the occurrences? found in the various documents and establishing hierarchies between the topics. The
material topics of the sector were identified through the occurrences, which were compared with the topics that
emerged from the 2017 'tree'.

In order to obtain the significance of the material topics for the company, an internal questionnaire was given to
a significant sample of representative contact people from all the company's departments.

As stated, collecting external points of view was facilitated by the use of innovative tools such as semantics and
big data analysis, "as well as digital collaboration tools”.

At the end of this initial screening, the company was able to draw up a list of topics representing the following
macro areas:

™ correctness of corporate conduct;
™ stakeholder engagement;
= integrating economic, social and environmental aspects in governance and the strategic plan;

™ supporting the development of digital skills in the community (in schools, in the public administration, in
businesses);

™ developing the resilience of areas to disasters and calamities;

™ consolidating social and environmental aspects in the supply chain;

™ managing the workforce and employment development;

™ ~~ managing the health and safety of workers;

™ developing personnel competencies;

= service quality;

™ — online protection of minors (cyber bullying, child pornography, gambling);

™ safeguarding privacy and personal data protection and security;

™ contributing to and taking initiatives to fight climate change in company policies, strategies and processes;
™ reducing the environmental impact of TIM's operations;

™ increasing the use of energy from renewable sources in company processes;
= electromagnetism;

Each taxonomy is made up of interrelated concepts and keywords with different correlation and significance levels. Each taxonomy was

constructed using both Italian and English terms.

For example RobecoSam (Dow Jones Sustainability Index), FTSE4good and Sustainalytics questionnaires.

For example, the Digital Economy Society Index which monitors different aspects of the digitization level of the individual European countries.

For example: The “Piano Nazionale italiano per l'Agenda 2030” (\talian National Plan for the 2030 agenda) of the Italian government, the “Ernst &

Young Megatrends report 2015”, the “Fair and Sustainable Well-Being in Italy 2016” (BES) report promoted by the National Council for Economy

and Labor (CNEL) and the National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT).

° The occurrences identify the number of times that a concept (or a specific term) is detected within the document by the semantic engine and

provide an indication of the significance of the topic detected in the context of the document.

In keeping with activities of the previous years, stakeholders involved in engagement activities were surveyed, in addition to many other entities,

for a total of approximately 500, concerning 8 categories of TIM stakeholders. Three types of sources were identified for the analysis:

‘+ documents issued by stakeholders (in particular sustainability reports);

«statements issued on company websites;

+ discussions on social networks concerning the themes identified thanks to TIM Data Room activities.

4 Digital instruments were used for engagement. In particular:

‘* a questionnaire was given to stakeholders, via the platform, from the categories: customers, suppliers, competitors, institutions, environment,
community, persons, also collecting suggestions and feedback;

‘+ TiM's vendor assessment platform was used to specifically focus on the category of suppliers;

‘+ information on TIM customers’ views on the proposed issues was obtained from the TIM.com site.

= digital inclusion in society;

=~ developing digital infrastructures with next-generation networks;

™ promoting and safeguarding human rights;

™ reducing inequalities and promoting equal opportunities in the Company.

This approach has enabled TIM to expand stakeholder engagement and dynamically observe topics in order to
measure their trends over time.

Results at a glance

At the end of the analysis, TIM attributed a relevance score based on the occurrence of the topics!2.

The key issues for the Group and Its stakeholders retlect the Sustainable Development Goals which |IM believes
it can help achieve to a greater extent through its own personnel, technologies and services, adopting business
policies that promote and safeguard human rights and the environment.

Specifically, the relevant Goals are:

™ No. 4: Quality education;

™ No. 5: Gender equality;

™ No. 7: Affordable and clean energy;

: Decent work and economic growth;

™ No. 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure;

™ No. 10: Reduced inequalities;

“Service quality” is the topic which registered the greatest increase, overall, compared to 2017. “Fair corporate
conduct” was instead the most relevant issue for external stakeholders; “Safeguarding privacy and personal
data protection and security”, “Developing digital infrastructures with next-generation networks” and
“Supporting the development of digital skills in the community (in schools, in the public administration, in
businesses)” all ranked higher than 2017.

"Reducing the environmental impact of TIM's operations" is one of the most significant topics due to the
important contribution TIM can provide through its solutions as a leading ICT company and through its adoption
of strategies and policies to contain its energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Validation and Review

The validation of the topics and of the entire materiality analysis process was carried out by the Sustainability
Reporting, Monitoring and Relationship (SRMR) division, with the support of RE2N, a company that develops
innovative tools for sustainability and Shared Value, and TIM Data Room. The review phase is due to take place
as a preparatory stage prior to the next reporting cycle, with the aim of submitting the results of the analyses
carried out, updated in the following year, to specific stakeholder engagement activities.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Approach to innovation, choice of topics, innovation governance
process

Innovation, understood as a research and development activity for innovative technologies and services,
processes and business models, represents a key factor in the company’s ability to keep up with the profound
transformations brought about through ICT, as well as a necessary asset acting as a driving force in this evolution
in terms of its customers and the national system, helping to overcome the socio-cultural barriers that limit the
opportunity to participate in the information society and enjoyment of the relative benefits.

TIM has always considered innovation to be a strategic asset and takes great care in governing individual
aspects, from its strategic role to its responsibility, objectives and policy.

In terms of role, both technological and business-based innovation are also confirmed in 2018 as the central
element to the response to change in the technological, market and competitive context. In line with this, the
Group has taken action in several ways:

™ by continuing the action, underway for several years now, to strengthen internal innovation lines, focusing
laboratory activities and research groups on key aspects of the development of the fixed and mobile network
towards future 5G standards and ultrabroadband, and issues concerning service platforms and new
operations systems;

= by confirming the drive towards the “Open Innovation” principle with the aim of maximizing the benefits
deriving from the integration of innovative contributions generated internally with external sources of
innovative ideas;

™ by interacting with the start-up world in order to catalyze the latter's capacity for innovation through the
TIM #Wcap acceleration program;

= by implementing initiatives which allow for the growth of co-creation ecosystems like the loT Open Lab, a
laboratory dedicated to the development of loT solutions based on key technologies for the Telco Operator
with a view to open innovation.

More specifically, innovation management is overseen, with different missions, by the Technology Architectures
& Innovation Department and by engineers, but involves various internal and external stakeholders of the
company:

™ other areas of the company involved from time to time, both as internal customers for the innovation output
solution and as centers of expertise on the topic;

™ traditional and digital partners, for the joint go2market of digital services;

™ research centers and universities, for cooperation and joint projects. In 2018, 18 research contracts came
into effect, for a total value of 840,000 euros;

™ Standardization Bodies and Associations: TIM is still very active within the main Standardization Bodies and
Associations, with 27 memberships in 2018, for a cost of 900,000 euros. On a national, but above all
international, level there is a broad circle made up of standardization bodies (ETSI, ITU, CENELEC and 3GPP
among others), associations (GSMA and NGMN to name the major ones), alliances (oneM2m and BBF), and
telco open communities (ONF, OPNFV and CORD), which play a fundamental role in the evolution of the TLC
industry for networks, platforms and services;

™ Ministries (Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of Education, Universities and Research), the
European Union and public authorities (CNR and local authorities) for projects funded through participation
in competitive tenders, and partnership initiatives. In particular, two specific consortiums were set up in 2018.
KIC U-Move, the Community for Knowledge and Innovation in urban mobility, promoted by the European
Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), with the support of the EU, in order to promote urban mobility,
and Competence Industry Manufacturing 4.0 (CIM 4.0), set up in December 2018 after the award of the
Ministry of Economic Development Industry 4.0 contract, to help fast track the process to transform a
considerable section of the production system at local and national level, and act as an integrated hub for
the dissemination of expertise and good practices, offering training and on-site experience, in technological
and industrial sectors in Piedmont and other Italian regions. The Ministry of Economic Development will fund
the consortium projects over the next three years.

TIM's technological evolution is based on CTO Technology Strategy, which identifies technology strategy in terms
of guidelines, specific technologies and roadmaps to adopt in the long term. The three-year technological plan
is the reference policy for the Group and includes the technological evolution plans of subsidiaries. The plan sets
out the main external factors that may affect company strategies (regulation, standards, suppliers, other market
operators) and establishes the company entities involved, the applicable technological architecture and
evolution of specific technologies, along with relative roadmaps for deployment or assessment. The qualitative
and/or quantitative goals address the long term and have been given an annual framework. They are defined
so that they can be objectively measured in compliance with quality standards (ISO 9001) and environmental

Report on Operations of the Research and development | 66
TIM Group


--- Page 60 ---

standards (ISO 14001), and operational innovation processes, in the same way as TIM processes, in general, are
based on TMF's reference standard E-Tom.

Overall, in 2018 TIM committed around 1,300 people to working on technological innovation and engineering in
Italy, for an overall investment for the Company of 1,165 million euros, which is equivalent to around 8% of
revenues.

Activities for the future of mobility and networks: initiatives for 5G

In October 2018, the tender of the Ministry of Economic Development for the award of user rights to 694-790
MHz, 3600-3800 MHz, and 26.5-27.5 GHz band frequencies for 5G mobile telecommunications services was
completed, with an overall undertaking for TIM of 2,399 million euros. The rights to 3600-3800 MHz and 26.5-
27.5 GHz band frequencies were assigned on a definitive basis in January 2019, while the rights to 694-790 MHz
band frequencies will be made available in July 2022.

5G allows not only faster speeds than those possible with earlier technologies, but also a multitude of services
with very different requirements, in particular in the mMTC® and URLLC* areas.

TIM has followed the development of 5G from 2012, actively participating in the definition of international
standards as well as European consortia and projects which laid the foundations for the system and contributed
to the introduction of innovative use cases and applications. In particular, TIM participated in the European
Horizon 2020 METIS and METIS I! projects included in the SGPPP European initiative and in another 12 projects
concerning all the main technological turning points of 5G, collaborating with the main providers of network
technologies and terminals through specific MoUs.

The operational activities for technological development and 5G trials are accompanied by structured technical
communication ranging from publishing to promotion with events of a scientific scope. Many initiatives
dedicated to 5G took place during 2018, including the inauguration of the first Innovation Hub in Rome, which is
the very cornerstone of the agreement. Another important event was held in Turin, at Palazzo Madama, with
two days when TIM opened its doors to the public with live demos of 5G services, including automotive, digital
tourism, Industry 4.0 and smartcity services, which will soon be available on the network. In Turin, TIM will
develop the first 5G network in Italy, thanks to an agreement with the local authorities, following on from three
important projects started in 2017 - Torino 5G, San Marino 5G and Bari-Matera 5G - for 5G coverage of these
municipalities, involving over 55 partners.

In 2018, these projects continued, consolidating activities to provide coverage, with San Marino becoming the
first European microstate to be covered by 5G.Research and partnerships with organizations and universities
involved for Bari-Matera were also set up and activities will continue in 2019.

Over the next few years, 5G will be the revolution that everyone can experience in their daily lives.

Main applications will target:

™ the automotive and transport sector with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity,
aimed at increasing safety and energy saving; connectivity for infotainment; self-driving vehicles and related
aspects;

™ industry 4.0, i.e. the digital transformation of industry; the systematic addition of sensors to products, to
produce data to improve production and processes; the evolution of the supply chain to enable real-time
management of relations with suppliers and end customers;

™ the world of new media, with changes in user trends and new formats, including virtual and enhanced reality
solutions;

= healthcare, with remote assistance, to enable specialists to assist patients with chronic diseases from afar;

™ public safety, with mobile video surveillance solutions that can integrate data and images for a far broader
vision, guaranteeing greater public security levels than the past;

™ assistance for tourists who can have information and multimedia content on their visits at their fingertips,
thanks to sensors on their smartphones;

™ the information sector in general which can ensure "live" connections with a better video quality without
complex instruments, thanks to a greater bandwidth availability, combined with a reduced latency.

In November 2016, TIM opened the loT Open Lab, which became fully operational in 2017, at its base in Turin. Its
purpose, according to the methods inherent in Open Innovation, is to support the development of loT solutions
based on key technologies for Telco Operators. In particular, the loT Open Lab acts as a business accelerator to
support companies in entering the ecosystem of technologies standardized by the 3GPP and, as regards the
current period, Narrow Band loT technologies. In 2018, more than 180 companies and customers visited the Lab,
and among them, around fifty construction companies agreed a partnership with TIM allowing them to use the
Lab's facilities free of charge.

Research with Universities

The Open Innovation activities (understood as R&D participatory behavior) for 2018 were largely concentrated
on the new Innovation model pursued at TIM and guided by top management. Research and development
activities in 2018 focused on infrastructure issues and application solutions with a particular emphasis on
opportunities afforded by 5G.

As already stated, the financial commitment amounted to 840,000 euros, involving 70 TIM technicians and 60
university researchers dedicated to specific research, including:

™ research projects on cognitive computing, artificial intelligence solutions and 5G in partnership with Turin
Polytechnic;

™ the academic research partnership as part of the Ministry of Economic Development Bari-Matera 5G project
involved TIM, together with academic organizations, in the full 5G coverage of cities scheduled for 2019, with
10 application areas started and over 70 use scenarios. In 2021, the entire metropolitan area of the 2 cities
will be covered;

™ research projects started also in partnership with the University of Catania under the technology/innovation
plan to fast-track the market delivery of the entire loT ecosystem and 5G development activities.

Funded research activities

TIM has always been active in innovative and research initiatives funded by the European Commission and by
national public administrations. This has enabled it to obtain funding of nearly 14 million euros over the 2016-
2018 period and to take part in projects with a high innovation content, thanks to which it has been able to
develop and consolidate its own know-how in sectors with a fast-paced technological evolution, working
together with leading European, North American, Korean and Japanese research centers. In this area, it has been
involved in activities carried out as part of funded projects concerning 5G, virtualization and intelligent mobility
services, furthering its expertise and gaining a prominent position in the international sphere.

Patents and Intellectual Property Rights

During 2018, the Group's portfolio of patents grew to include new patents filed (TIM ranks sixth as the Italian
company for number of European patents filed), and was also streamlined, eliminating some patents that were
no longer worth investing in, given advances in technological progress.

The patenting areas relate to the whole ICT sector, with areas of excellence in the mobile sector, where TIM is
one of the six leading Telcos worldwide.

Specifically, TIM's portfolio of patents included 3,256 patents held by TIM in 2018, of which 2,754 granted in 41
countries around the world and 502 published in 15 patent offices, relative to some 600 inventions.

A total of 11% of the patented inventions stem from work with universities and research institutes, from 1997 to
the present day.

Participation in a Patent Pool for LTE with a patent essential for the relative standard should also be noted. The
Patent Pool acquired new participants over the course of the year (bringing the current total to 19 license-
holders) and granted several licenses to 42 companies.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN BRAZIL

The Innovation & Technology Department, headed by the CTO of TIM Brasil, is responsible for Research and
Development (R&D) activities. Its main areas of focus include: identifying technological innovation for the
network and the evolutionary needs for new technologies and devices, setting architectural guidelines, and the
development of strategic partnerships, so as to exploit new business models and guarantee the evolution of the
network infrastructure in line with the business strategy. The organizational structure of Innovation &
Technology is currently made up of 25 people in the Networks area, including telecommunications engineers,
electrics and electronics engineers, IT experts and other technicians of various origins, competences and
experiences, who cover all innovative needs and provide support to R&D.

In terms of infrastructure, one important result was the establishment of TIM Lab, a multi-purpose test
environment focusing on innovation, which is able to guarantee the assessment of innovative services, products
and technologies, certifying their functional efficiency and performance and the development of new models
and configurations, consolidating the innovation flow. TIM Lab plays a strategic role in providing support for the
conduct of Credibility Test, Trials and Proof of Concept (POC), for the validation of the services in collaboration
with the main suppliers of technology and partners, through the sharing of knowledge and the technological
infrastructures for interoperability tests, the assessment of capacity and the definition of technical requirements;
in synergy with the R&D department, it facilitates innovation and promotes collaborations with universities and
research institutes.

In January 2017, a new TIM Lab Innovation Center was opened at the Corporate Executive Offices complex in
Barra da Tijuca, in the state of Rio de Janeiro: a building with a surface area of 650 square meters, able to
accommodate more than 60 people. This new office hosts technicians and researchers and can be seen as a
space of innovation open to new opportunities and the development of innovation for the Brazilian
telecommunications market, also operating as a national reference point for R&D activities.

In 2018, more than 180 validation and innovation projects were concluded. Moreover, new technological areas,
such as transport and fixed access solutions, were included in the range of initiatives relating to innovation and
R&D. In this regard, more than 22 million reais were invested in the 2016/17 period, also for new lab premises, in
addition to the 4 million reais in 2018; based on the 2019-2021 plan, further investments of 12 million reais have
been allocated.

The Innovation & Technology department continued to work on projects and initiatives aiming to ensure the
evolution of the business of TIM Brasil through the recommendation of sustainable, efficient network platforms
and “disruptive” models, including anticipating the availability of new services. These projects can be divided
into the following groups:

™ new generation networks;
™ positive environmental and social impacts;
™ Open Lab initiatives.

Next generation network projects

The reassignment of the 1,800 MHz, 850 MHz and 2,100 MHz bandwidths from 2G/3G to 4G gives TIM Brasil three
important competitive advantages:

™ reduction of costs for LTE deployment;

™ expansion of the LTE coverage area and activation of the Carrier Aggregation strategy, improving the
customer experience through higher “throughputs”;

™ improved indoor coverage. In addition to the expansion of coverage, use of the 850/1,800/2,100 MHz
bandwidths could increase the capacity in cities already covered by the LTE bandwidth at 2.6 GHz, at limited
additional cost.

Another important consideration in this scenario is that over 94% of current LTE terminals are already
compatible with the 1,800 MHz and 2,600 MHz bandwidths, and with the other bandwidths available; hence,
implementation of the LTE multilayer is proving to be an excellent strategy that benefits from the dissemination
of devices.

The deployment of the LTE 700 MHz layer will result in significant expansion of the coverage and indoor
penetration, promoting the presence of LTE throughout the national territory and consolidating TIM Brasil’s
leadership in LTE. The actual roll-out will follow the rules dictated by the EADs in order to manage the spectrum
cleaning and avoid interference problems with the analogue TV transmission service. 82% of the LTE devices
employed by the current users of TIM Brasil services are enabled for the 700 MHz bandwidth.

At the end of 2018, over 1,400 cities could test the LTE 700 MHz coverage.

In 2015, as part of the IP Multimedia Network Evolution, three tests were carried out at the Innovation Lab to
assess the IMS*®. In 2016 the tests were extended to live networks, allowing TIM Brasil to set up the functional
infrastructure to provide services such as Voice over LTE (VoLTE), Video over LTE (ViLTE) and Wi-Fi Calling,
entirely laid on IP and activated by an IMS platform. In 2017 TIM launched VoLTE high definition voice call services
on the market, providing call services without the need to pass through switched lines. At the end of 2018, over
2,500 cities could use this service.

Projects with positive environmental and social impacts

The expansion of “4G RAN sharing”, in partnership with other Brazilian mobile operators, aims to define the
architectural requirements, technical assumptions and specifications for the “LTE RAN sharing” solution,
optimizing the network resources and costs. In this regard, TIM has pursued and considered RAN Sharing
Solutions since 2007. Another strong motivation lies in coverage issues and timing in compliance with regulatory
requirements. The RAN Sharing agreement allows TIM to promote the evolution of LTE development in rural
areas of Brazil, with effective sharing of access and backhauling. At present 4G RAN Sharing relies on two
national partners, improving the possible benefits and efficiencies of this technical model.

Following continuous testing activities, savings and energy efficiency solutions were introduced, which primarily
concern the low traffic periods for the 2G, 3G and 4G access layers. The energy consumption recorded for the
site, dependent on the access technology and coverage conditions, showed a reduction of up to 10%. According
to TIM Brasil, the large-scale introduction of loT could drastically change the mobile market in that it exploits the
creation of services and represents a potential tool for agricultural applications, connected vehicles, tracking
solutions, and social and healthcare support. In 2017 TIM invested in TIM Lab and in the E2E sector, improving
existing smart parking applications and activating the connection of new applications, preparing the terrain for
future NB-loT and LTE-M commercial networks, which were launched in 2018 in the city of Santa Rita do Sapucai.
Since 2018, TIM Brasil together with Nokia and BR Digital, has offered connectivity services in rural areas, not
only enabling agrobusiness commercial applications, but also the digital inclusion of sector employees and
residents in small towns.

Open Lab initiatives

In 2017 TIM Brasil joined the Telecom Infra Project (TIP), an initiative founded by Facebook, SK Telecom, Deutsche
Telekom, Nokia, Intel and other companies, which aims to identify new approaches to the creation and
deployment of telecommunications network infrastructure. TIM Brasil has transformed TIM Lab into the first TIP
Community Lab in Latin America, which will be used by TIP members to create universal standards relating to
solutions, initially for transport networks, in order to overcome the challenges linked to the interoperability of
the different providers. This initiative represents an open and collaborative approach to the development and
testing of new technologies and solutions.

Moreover, in October 2018, TIM joined up with a new work team in the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) together with
Vodafone and other mobile operators, called DCSG (Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway). This project is an
opportunity to define a common set of requirements to produce devices that are more open, flexible and cost-
effective.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR 2019

The strategy of the TIM 2019-2021 Plan marks a major break with the past, focusing on execution as a key factor
in TIM's organic transformation, together with strategic initiatives capable of freeing up value. The Plan's
objectives are the relaunch of the Domestic business, with a focus on the quality, size and technical skills of TIM,
and the strengthening of business in Brazil, taking advantage of growth opportunities (e.g. residential broadband
and ultra-broadband connectivity) and continuing the repositioning of customers towards postpaid offers,
leveraging 4G leadership.

On the Domestic market the Consumer segment begins with consolidated competitive advantages (quality, size
and technical skills), to bring rationality to both the Fixed and Mobile market, using network quality and product
reliability to leverage optimized profitability and expand the range of offered services. By 2021, ultra-broadband
penetration will reach 80% of the broadband customer base (up from 45% in 2018).

The Business segment will put itself forward as a reference supplier and top ICT quality partner for SMEs and as
a leading ICT solutions provider for large customers. Revenues from ICT services will grow significantly, reaching
48% of total revenues of the Large Business segment by 2021 (up from 39% in 2018).

The Wholesale segment will defend its access market share and confirm its leadership in ultra-broadband
coverage. Fiber access will double compared to 2018.

The Telecom Italia Sparkle group will expand its infrastructure and grow enterprise networking and the cloud;
partnerships to accelerate growth and expand strategic options will also be assessed.

In Brazil, the mobile customer base will continue to migrate towards postpaid offers, increasing from 36% in
2018 to around 50% in 2021. The fiber development program (backbone, backhauling and FTTH) will also
continue and residential ultra-broadband customers will be at 1.2 million in 2021. Cost rationalization and digital
transformation will be a leverage to support margin improvement, with an EBITDA margin of at least 40% by
2020.

TIM's strategy aims to reduce debt through cash generation growth in the domestic market, achieved through
stabilization of revenues, a streamlined costs structure and working capital and invested capital optimization. A
dedicated department will ensure cost efficiencies are made and, through already identified actions, will allow
for a reduction in the reducible cost base of 8% in 2021 compared to 2018; invested capital optimization will also
take place through network sharing. To this end TIM and Vodafone Italia signed a memorandum of
understanding in February 2019 and agreed to start exclusive negotiations on a partnership project to share the
active component of the 5G network, assess the possibility of sharing active devices on the 4G network and
expand the current passive sharing agreement.

The technological approach outlined in the new TIM plan puts modernization, simplification and artificial
intelligence at the heart of future capital expenditure. TIM will build a completely new and automated 5G
network, continuing with the disposal and consolidation of redundant assets (e.g. data centers and exchanges).

The main financial targets of the 2019-2021 plan are as follows, it should also be remembered that the 2019
forecasts assume an operating performance affected by competitive dynamics that have already impacted -
increasingly - the whole of 2018. These dynamics will have full effect on 2019, influencing the “Year on Year”
comparability of the coming periodic financial reports and will determine the highlight of a recovery trend only
during the second part of the year.

TIM Group:
~ Total Equity Free Cash Flow (2019/2021) of around 3.5 billion euros with the possibility of further growth
through non-organic activities currently not included;
- Group debt of around 22 billion euros in 2021 before non-organic operations (on the same accounting
basis as 2018).

Domestic:
~ Slightly declining revenues from services (low single-digit) during the period with the aim of stabilizing
them from 2020;
- Organic EBITDA in low single-digit/mid single digit decline in 2019 and low single-digit growth for both
2020 and 2021;
- Capex equal to about 3 billion euros per year.

Brazil:
- Revenues from services growing by 3-5% in 2019 and mid single-digit growth in 2020 and 2021;
- EBITDA growth (mid/high single digit) in 2019 with the confirmed EBITDA margin target of at least
40% in 2020;
- Cumulative capex totaling around 12:5 billion reais in 2019/2021.

MAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Risk governance is a strategic tool for value creation. The TIM Group has adopted an Enterprise Risk Management
Model based on the methodology of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(ERM CoSO Report), which enables the identification and management of risk in a uniform manner across the
Group companies, highlighting potential synergies among the actors involved in the assessment of the Internal
Control and Risk Management System. The ERM process is designed to identify potential events that may affect
the business, to manage risk within acceptable limits and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
achievement of corporate objectives.

The business outlook for 2019 could moreover be affected by risks and uncertainties caused by a multitude of
factors, the majority of which are beyond the Group's control.

These include, but are not limited to, the change in market context, entry of new potential competitors in the
fixed and mobile field, start of proceedings by the authorities and delays in new strategy implementation, with
effects - at this moment not foreseeable - in terms of strategic choices and development timing of the already
announced triennial objectives, which may lead, in some cases, to a different progression in timing in respect of
that initially foreseen or achievement of the objectives through new and more joined-up methods.

The main risks affecting the business activities of the TIM Group, which may impact, even significantly, the ability
to achieve the objectives of the Group are presented below in an analytical way.

STRATEGIC RISKS

Risks related to macro-economic factors

The TIM Group's economic and financial situation depends on the influence of numerous macroeconomic factors
such as economic growth, political stability, consumer confidence, and changes in interest rates and exchange
rates in the markets in which it operates. In 2018 economic growth in the euro area suffered an unexpected
slowdown, suggesting that growth for the year would be lower than in 2017. The slowdown in the Italian
economy was more evident than in other European countries: GDP recorded two consecutive negative quarter-
on-quarter changes in the second half of the year. 2018 closed with an average growth of 0.9% in real terms,
against a growth of 1.6% recorded in 2017, and growth for 2019 is expected at an even lower rate compared to
2018.

The slowdown in Italian growth reflects the deceleration in exports (in particular towards its main trading
partner, Germany, which in turn recorded a sharp downturn in the third quarter), and expected normalization of
monetary policies. On the domestic front, the uncertainty related to budget policy and possible repercussions
on the financial markets and confidence of households and businesses had a considerable impact.

In Brazil, the expected results may be significantly affected by the macroeconomic and political situation. After
two years of negative GDP growth - one of the deepest and longest recessions in its history - Brazil returned to
growth in 2017 (+1%). In December the Central Bank slightly reduced its GDP growth forecasts for 2018, from
1.4 % estimated in September to 1.3%, due mainly to the performance of public accounts. The elections which
ended with the new president voted in with a considerable popular majority should help to attenuate the political
uncertainty and boost the confidence of households and businesses, creating a climate that is far more favorable
for the economy to recover. Short and medium term growth forecasts remain tied to pension reforms and the
introduction of a more efficient public spending system, which is not an easy task for the new president.

Risks related to competition

The telecommunications market is characterized by strong competition that may reduce market share in the
geographical areas where the TIM Group is engaged as well as erode prices and margins. Competition is focused
on innovative products and services and on the capacity to move towards higher levels of convergence in service
and expand it to the content offering, but also on the price competition in both traditional and other services.
The use of new technologies (loT) and new knowledge and customer management tools (Big Data) represent
enabling factors in the mitigation of competition risks, however failure to exploit these opportunities could
become an additional element of risk.

In the area of infrastructure competition, the growth of alternative operators could represent a threat for TIM,
also beyond the Plan period.

liad launched its new mobile service at the end of May with the objective of capturing 10-15% of the market,
adopting the same strategies it currently employs on the French market. In addition, Open Fiber and Infratel
started up plans for the development of an UBB telecommunications network as an alternative to the TIM
network, respectively in major Italian cities and in areas of market failure, opening up the possibility of a new
wave of competition in those areas, with impacts for both the Wholesale and Retail segments.

Report on Operations of the Main risks and uncertainties | 74
TIM Group


--- Page 68 ---

Competitive risks in the Brazilian market lie in the rapid transition of the business model tied to traditional
services and the potential consolidation of the sector. As the consumption patterns of consumers change
(migration from voice to data services), service providers need to act swiftly in upgrading their infrastructure and
modernizing their portfolios of products and services. In this context, the Tim Brasil group could be impacted by
the need to upgrade its technologies and infrastructure rapidly and by greater competition, in the form of
aggressive sales strategies and potential business combinations in the sector. At the same time, the deep
economic and political crisis in the country has had a direct impact on consumption, especially in the Prepaid
segment.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Operational risks inherent in our business relate, on the one hand, to failures in systems and/or network
platforms, loss of critical or commercially sensitive data, possible inadequacies in internal processes, external
factors, frauds, employee errors and errors in properly documenting transactions; and on the other, to the
possibility of implementing strategies for value creation through the optimization of costs and capital
expenditure, which in part could depend on factors beyond the control of the Company, such as the cooperation
of external counterparties (suppliers, trade unions, industry associations) and laws and regulations.

Risks related to the development of fixed and mobile networks

To maintain and expand our customer portfolio in each of the markets in which the TIM Group operates, it is
necessary to maintain, update and improve existing networks in a timely manner. A reliable and high quality
network is necessary to maintain the customer base and minimize terminations to protect the Company's
revenues from erosion.

The maintenance and improvement of existing installations depend on the Group's ability to:

™ deliver network development plans within the time-frames contemplated by business development plans
and with the necessary level of effectiveness/efficiency;

™ upgrade the capabilities of the networks to provide customers with services that are closer to their needs;

™ increase the geographical coverage of innovative services;

™ upgrade the structure of the systems and the networks to adapt it to new technologies;

™ sustaining the necessary level of capital expenditure in the long term.

Risks related to business continuity

The TIM Group's success depends heavily on the ability to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted delivery of
the products and services we provide through the availability of processes and the relating supporting assets,
which are sensitive to various internal and external threats. TIM has adopted a “Business Continuity Model
System” framework in line with international standards, to analyze and prevent these risks.

Risks related to disputes and litigation

The TIM Group has to deal with disputes and litigation with tax authorities and government agencies, regulators,
competition authorities, other telecommunications operators and other entities. The possible impacts of such
proceedings are generally uncertain. In the event of settlement unfavorable to the Group, these issues may,
individually or as whole, have an adverse effect, which may even be significant, on its operating results, financial
position and cash flows.

Risks of internal/external fraud

Technological progress means that increasingly sophisticated tools and techniques, which are quick acting and
have a considerable economic impact are available for fraudulent activity.

“Conventional” phenomena such as subscription, interconnection, and commercial fraud currently generate the
highest part of revenue loss and will continue to be significant in the near future, however new types of Internet-
style fraud will gradually gain more ground (Internet spamming/phishing, service reselling, VoIP bypass, etc.).
Furthermore, some specific types of provided services (e.g. wholesale interconnection, voice or data services)

Report on Operations of the Main risks and uncertainties | 75
TIM Group


--- Page 69 ---

are potentially at risk of third party use for the construction of fictitious transaction schemes, tax avoidance
offenses and/or international money laundering.

By way of example only, Fraud Management covers:

™ traffic or marketing-related fraud;

™ fraud connected with procurement processes and the supply of goods and services;
= computer fraud;

= fraud related to the use and disclosure of confidential information;

= tax and/or financial fraud;

which are:

™ identified by specific controls during routine working activities, or reported from sources inside/outside the
company;

™ committed by entities outside the company, or by or with the assistance of employees (internal fraud).

The TIM Group has an established organizational model based on the governance of fraud and a separate
operational governance system for managing and combating fraud.

The procedure to combat external fraud, drawing on company processes at risk of the offenses contemplated
in Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 being committed, sets out internal control mechanisms, including instructions
on how employees and Company staff/partners (including suppliers) must behave (Prevention). In the Detection
stage, potential cases of fraud are identified and after a preliminary check of the possible grounds the cases may
be subject to Investigation and Tackling. To complete the fraud management end-to-end cycle, the results of
actions taken are assessed with monitoring and any actions to improve the fraud management process are
identified.

Likewise, internal fraud is managed in compliance with constraints in trade union agreements banning the
remote control of employees' work, and involves monitoring and checking access to company systems only for
operational purposes, and access to registration data only in the case of identified anomalies.

FINANCIAL RISKS

The TIM Group may be exposed to financial risks, such as risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and
exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and risks related to the performance of the equity markets in general,
and - more specifically - risks related to the performance of the share price of the TIM Group companies. These
risks may adversely impact the earnings and the financial structure of the Group. Accordingly, to manage those
risks, the TIM Group has established guidelines, at central level, which must be followed for operational
management, identification of the most suitable financial instruments to meet set goals, and monitoring the
results achieved. In particular, in order to mitigate the liquidity risk, the TIM Group aims to maintain an "adequate
level of financial flexibility", in terms of cash and syndicated committed credit lines, enabling it to cover
refinancing requirements at least for the next 12-18 months.

The potential impact of Brexit will depend on the result of negotiations on the "divorce" agreement with the EU,
which is even more uncertain, after the House of Commons voted against the British Prime Minister's Brexit plan
in January 2019.

Brexit and possible future scenarios connected to the outcomes of negotiations could cause further instability
on global financial markets in an international context that is already affected by the trade dispute between the
US and China.

The potential effects of Brexit could adversely affect our financial conditions, our business and the related
earnings and cash flows.

REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS

Regulatory risks

The electronic communications industry is highly regulated. As such, new decisions by the Communications
Authority (AGCom) may lead to changes in the regulatory framework that may affect the expected results of
the Group and the guidance announced to the market. In addition, the position held by TIM In the fixed-line
markets and the structure of the mobile markets results in high levels of scrutiny from the Italian Antitrust
Authority (AGCM) over competition in the sector.

The main elements that introduce uncertainty are:

Report on Operations of the Main risks and uncertainties | 76
TIM Group


--- Page 70 ---

™ lack of predictability in start-up timing and consequent final decisions in new proceedings by AGCom and
AGCM;

™  AGCom decisions with retroactive effect (for example, the revision of prices applicable to past years and the
effectiveness and actual implementation of repricing policies, also following administrative rulings);

™  AGCom decisions that can influence the technological choices, with potential impact on the timing of return
on infrastructure investment;

™ any AGCM decisions that can limit TIM's competitive capacity (for example, in terms of minimum retail prices
to guarantee replicability);

™ any inadequacy in the implementation of processes and systems for the management of regulated services,
identified by AGCom or AGCM.

Compliance risks

The TIM Group may be exposed to risks of non-compliance due to non-observance/breach of internal (self-
regulation, such as, for example, bylaws, code of ethics) and external rules (laws, regulations, new accounting
standards and Authority orders), with consequent judicial or administrative penalties, financial losses or
reputational damage.

The TIM Group aims to ensure that processes, and, therefore, the procedures and systems governing them, and
corporate conduct comply with legal requirements. The risk is associated with potential time lags in making the
processes compliant with regulatory changes or whenever non-conformities are identified and is monitored by
the dedicated internal control system.

Compliance with Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR), directly
applicable as from May 25, 2018 and enacted in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 101/2018 is particularly important.
This Regulation has increased administrative fines considerably compared to the Data Protection Act previously
in effect, and in some cases fines of up to 20 million euros may be administered, or in the case of companies, of
up to 4% of their global annual turnover of the previous year, if this amount is higher than 20 million euros.
Starting from the operating model already in use with pre-existing privacy regulations, the TIM Group has taken
necessary action to comply with the GDPR.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
DIRECTION AND COORDINATION ACTIVITY

On May 16, 2018, the Board of Directors of TIM S.p.A. acknowledged that the grounds for considering Vivendi the
entity exercising direction and coordination powers over TIM no longer applied. Furthermore, on June 25, 2018,
the Board of Directors of TIM approved amendments to the internal procedure governing transactions with
related parties, and updated the relative related-party boundary to reflect the new situation, whereby Vivendi
no longer qualifies as the de facto controlling entity over TIM. The procedure was lastly updated by the Board of
Directors with some improvements on July 24, 2018.

In accordance with Article 5, paragraph 8 of Consob Regulation 17221 of March 12, 2010 concerning “Related-
party transactions” and the subsequent Consob Resolution 17389 of June 23, 2010, no significant transactions
were conducted in 2018, as defined by Article 4, paragraph 1a of the aforementioned regulation, that had a
material impact on the financial position or the performance of the TIM Group and TIM S.p.A. in 2018.

In addition, there were no changes or developments with respect to the related party transactions described in
the 2017 Report on Operations which had a significant effect on the financial position or on the performance of
the TIM Group and TIM S.p.A. in 2018.

Related-party transactions, when not dictated by specific laws, were conducted at arm's length. They were
performed in compliance with the internal procedure, which sets forth rules designed to ensure the transparency
and fairness of the transactions in accordance with Consob Regulation 17221/2010. The current procedure is
available on the website www.telecomitalia.com, under the Group section/Governance System channel.

For information on related-party transactions, see the Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Separate Financial Statements "Related-party transactions and direction and
coordination activity”.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In this Report on Operations, in the TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Separate Financial
Statements of the Parent, TIM S.p.A., for the year ended December 31, 2018, in addition to the conventional
financial performance measures established by IFRS, certain alternative performance measures are presented
for a better understanding of the performance of operations and financial position. Such measures, which are
also presented in other periodical financial reports (annual and interim) should, however, not be construed as a
substitute for those required by IFRS.

The alternative performance measures used are described below:

™~ EBITDA: this financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal presentations (business
plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors). It represents a useful unit of measurement
for assessing the operating performance of the Group (as a whole and at Business Unit level) and of the
Parent, TIM S.p.A., in addition to EBIT. These measures are calculated as follows:

Profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations

+ Finance expenses
- Finance income

+/- Other expenses (income) from investments

4h Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method 7
EBIT - Operating profit (loss)

7 Impairment losses (reversals) on non-current assets

+/- Losses (gains) on disposals of non-current assets

+ Depreciation and amortization

EBITDA - Operating profit before depreciation and amortization, capital gains (losses) and impairment reversals (losses) on
non-current assets

(1) “Expenses (income) from investments” for TIM S.p.A.
(2) Line item in Group consolidated financial statements only.

™ Organic change in Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT: these measures express changes (amount and/or
percentage) in Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, excluding, where applicable, the effects of the change in the
scope of consolidation and exchange differences.
TIM believes that the presentation of the organic change in revenues, EBITDA and EBIT allows for a more
complete and effective understanding of the operating performance of the Group (as a whole and at
Business Unit level) and of the Parent. This method of presenting information is also used in presentations
to analysts and investors. This Report on Operations provides a reconciliation between the “reported figure”
and the “organic” figure.

= EBITDA margin and EBIT margin: TIM believes that these margins represent useful indicators of the ability
of the Group, as a whole and at Business Unit level, and of the Parent to generate profits from its revenues.
In fact, EBITDA margin and EBIT margin measure the operating performance of an entity by analyzing the
percentage of revenues that are converted into EBITDA and EBIT, respectively. Such indicators are used by
TIM in internal presentations (business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors) in
order to illustrate the results from operations also through the comparison of the operating results of the
financial year being reported with those of the previous years.

= Net Financial Debt: TIM believes that the Net Financial Debt represents an accurate indicator of its ability to
meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less Cash and Cash Equivalents and
other Financial Assets. The Report on Operations includes two tables showing the amounts taken from the
statements of financial position and used to calculate the Net Financial Debt of the Group and Parent
respectively.
In order to better represent the actual change in Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual measure (named
“Net financial debt carrying amount”), the “Adjusted net financial debt” is also shown, which excludes
effects that are purely accounting in nature resulting from the fair value measurement of derivatives and
related financial liabilities/assets.
