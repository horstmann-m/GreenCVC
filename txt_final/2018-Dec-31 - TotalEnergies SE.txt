The Board of Directors determines the strategic orientations of TOTAL,
and supervises their implementation. It approves investment and
divestment operations when they concern amounts that exceed 3%
of the Group's equity and examines all matters related to the proper
running of the Company. It monitors the management of both financial
and non-financial matters and ensures the quality of information
provided to shareholders and to financial markets.

The Board of Directors relies on the work of four Committees that it
has constituted: the Audit Committee, the Governance and Ethics
Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Strategy & CSR
Committee.

Composed as of March 13, 2019, of 12 directors, including
9 independent members, the Board of Directors reflects diversity
and complementarity of experience, expertise, nationalities and
cultures necessary to take account of the interests of all the Group's
shareholders and stakeholders.

Since December 2015, Mr. Patrick Pouyanné has held the position
of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL S.A. His term of
office having been renewed at the General Shareholders’ Meeting on
June 1, 2018 for a three-year period, the Board of Directors has
reappointed Mr. Pouyanné as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
for an equal period to that of his mandate as a director. The decision
to uphold the combined functions of Chairman of the Board of
Directors and Chief Executive Officer was made following work
undertaken by the Governance and Ethics Committee, in the interest
of the Company and in compliance with the traditions of the Group.
The Board of Directors deemed that the unified Management Form
was most appropriate to the Group's organization, modus operandi
and business, and to the specificities of the oil and gas sector. In its
decision, the Board in particular noted the advantage of having unified

French Commercial Code.

management in strategic negotiations with States and the Group's
partners. The Board of Directors regularly examines whether maintaining
the unified Management Form remains appropriate.

Attentive to the concerns of investors and stakeholders, the Board of
Directors pays specific attention to the balance of power within the
Group. Consequently, every year, the Board examines desirable
changes to its composition to ensure it is maintaining a high level of
independence and the full involvement of the directors in the work of
the Board and of the Committees. It was also for these reasons that
the Board of Directors, at its meeting on December 16, 2015,
amended the provisions of its Rules of Procedure to provide for the
appointment of a Lead Independent Director in case of the combination
of the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief
Executive Officer. The Lead Independent Director's duties, resources
and rights are described in the Rules of Procedure of the Board of
Directors. Aside from these duties, the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and the Lead Independent Director strive to maintain permanent
contact on any important matter concerning the running of the
Company.

Since 2016, the Lead Independent Director has organized executive
sessions with the independent directors so that they may discuss
the Group's strategic challenges and working practices. The directors
are also in regular contact with the members of the Group's
management team, whether members of the Executive Committee
during Board Meetings or operational managers during Group site
visits. These interactions between directors and managers enable the
directors to gain a practical understanding of the Group's activities.

The balance of power within the Company's bodies is thereby
ensured by a stable and structured governance.

1.2 An ambition that goes hand in hand with
sustainable growth: “become the responsible

energy major”

1.2.1 Acollective ambition to meet the challenges facing the energy sector

TOTAL is an integrated energy group and one of the world's largest.
Through its international presence and its activities, TOTAL’s goal is
to make its development a vehicle of progress that benefits as many
people as possible.

The United Nations, which adopted in 2015 the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) originally aimed for States, have called
upon corporations’ contribution to collectively find solutions to
sustainable development challenges. TOTAL has committed since
2016 to contributing to the SDGs and has endorsed the United
Nations’ recommendations") and worked on better identifying the
scope of its contribution to the SDGs.

Through its activities, the Group is concerned by all of the SDGs.
However, TOTAL has identified certain SDGs as those on which it
can have the most significant contribution, such as decent work and
human rights, climate change and access to energy.

Access to energy is a source of progress and the condition for
economic and social development as well as for the improvement of
the standard of living of people around the world. In most countries,
and in the developing countries in particular, access to low-cost
energy is thus a priority.

The Group's vocation is to produce the energy that the world needs,
and will need in the future, and to make it accessible to as many
people as possible. This is a real challenge; close to one billion
individuals still have no access to electricity.

This vocation is to be accomplished in a responsible manner and by
working to make an effective contribution to the climate change
challenge, in particular.

Meeting the energy needs of a growing global population, providing
tangible solutions to contribute limiting global warming, adapting to
new patterns of energy production and consumption and changes
to the expectations of customers and stakeholders constitute the
challenges that a major energy player like TOTAL can help to tackle.

To meet these challenges, TOTAL’s ambition is to become the
responsible energy major by contributing to supply to as many people
as possible a more affordable, more available and cleaner energy:

— more affordable - as low-cost energy is essential to favor the
economic development of billions of people who seek to improve
their living conditions;

— more available - as people expect energy to be continuously
available and accessible on a daily basis;

— cleaner - as the Group aims to both reduce the environmental
footprint and the CO, emissions of its operations, and to actively
contribute to finding solutions to limit the impact of climate
change, particularly by providing its customers with a mix of
energy products whose carbon intensity is expected to decrease
regularly.

1.2.2 Aclear strategy for sustainable growth

To fulfill this ambition, TOTAL implements a clear strategy that is
based on four main priorities and that integrates the challenges of
climate change:

— drive profitable and sustainable growth in Exploration &
Production activities, with priority given to the production of gas
in particular of liquefied natural gas (the fossil fuel that emits the
least amount of carbon dioxide) and constant concern on producing
at a competitive cost by ensuring strict investment discipline;

— further develop the competitiveness of the large integrated
refining and petrochemical platforms and expand sustainable
biofuels and recycling activities;

— increase the distribution of petroleum products, particularly in
high-growing regions, and offer innovative solutions and services
that meet the needs of customers above and beyond the supply
of petroleum products; and

1.3.1.2 Five strong values at the heart of the Group

Safety, Respect for Each Other, Pioneer Spirit, Stand Together and
Performance-Minded represent, just as its history, the part of TOTAL’s

identity shared by all employees. These values guide the daily actions
and relations of the Group with its stakeholders.

“These values describe and unite us. They are the levers on which we rely to achieve our ambition of becoming the responsible energy

major.”

These five strong values also require all of TOTAL’s employees to act
in an exemplary manner in priority in the following areas: safety,
security, health, environment, integrity in all of its forms (particularly,
the prevention of corruption, fraud and anti-competitive practices)
and human rights.

Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

It is through strict adherence to these values and to this course of
action that the Group intends to build strong and sustainable growth
for itself and for all of its stakeholders, and thereby deliver on its
commitment to better energy.

1.3.2.1 Employee diversity, a competitive edge

The Group is an image of its employees: diverse. The diversity of
talents within TOTAL is crucial to its competitiveness, innovative
capacity and attractiveness.

With over 150 nationalities represented, a presence in over
130 countries, and more than 650 business-related competencies,
the Group is a global player. Women make up 35.1% of the workforce
and 27.7% of managers. A wide range of opinions and backgrounds
enable innovative solutions and new opportunities to arise.

Such diversity is an essential asset for the Group. The capacity of
the Group's employees to mobilize themselves and act in an
entrepreneurial spirit is vital. It enables ambitious projects to be
completed and offers everyone the opportunity to give meaning to
their work and grow professionally.

subsidiaries), 52% international members on the subsidiaries’
Management Committees and 24% international members on the
head office Management Committees. In order to strengthen the
representation of women in governing bodies, the Executive
Committee set a goal in late 2018 to reach 20% of women members

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP - INTEGRATED REPORT

Advantages that allow the Group to stand out in a changing energy world

1.3.2.2 Employee commitment is essential to the success of the Company project

The Group addresses its challenges thanks to the commitment of its
employees. It is for this reason that the Group strives to ensure that
the most demanding safety, ethics and integrity, management and
social performance practices are implemented wherever it operates.
The aim of this process is to create the conditions that enable
everyone to fulfill his or her potential and TOTAL to pursue its
development.

TOTAL has adopted a proactive approach by subscribing to the
principles of numerous national and international agreements that
fight against all forms of discrimination and by striving to ensure the
safety and security of its employees and the respect of their
fundamental rights. The Group has a long-standing commitment to
promoting equal opportunity and diversity, which constitute, for
everyone, a source of development where only expertise and talent
count. In 2018, the Group decided to sign the Global Business and
Disability Network Charter of the International Labour Organization
(ILO) and is gradually implementing these principles in its subsidiaries.

The Group is also committed to social dialogue, which is one of the
vectors used to modernize companies. Among the numerous
stakeholders with which TOTAL maintains regular dialogue, the
Group's employees and their representatives have a privileged
position and role.

This approach is illustrated by several commitments made by the
Group, such as its adhesion on December 21, 2017, to the Global
Deal initiative, alongside some 60 partners, states, trade unions,
companies and international organizations. This international
multi-party initiative aims at fighting against inequalities, encouraging
social dialogue and promoting fairer globalization. It states that social
dialogue, collective bargaining and trade-union freedom play an
essential role in the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs 8, 10 and 17) of the United Nations. Similarly, the signing of a
global agreement with the trade union federation IndustriALL in 2015

guarantees for the Group's employees a high level of commitment
to social matters in countries where the Group operates. The goal is
to maintain the partnership and renegotiate this agreement for 2019
and beyond. The Group had 316 active agreements (including 190 in
France) with employee representatives in place at the end of 2018.

TOTAL encourages a managerial policy that favors commitment,
accountability and performance evaluation and is built on promoting
functional and geographic mobility and training to ensure each
person's skills development and employability (76% of employees
within the scope of the WHRS") took at least one on site training
course in 2018).

The technical and commercial know-how of employees and their
ability to manage large projects underpin the Group's operational
excellence and are essential for the Group's development. It is thanks
to the recognized expertise of its employees that TOTAL is able to
form partnerships of trust with the world’s main producing and
consuming nations in the most demanding areas, such as deep
offshore, liquefied natural gas (LNG), low carbon energy, refining and
petrochemicals, which are also areas in which the Group has
developed some of the most high-performance platforms. It is for
this reason that all employees, regardless of their function, are
encouraged to build on their expertise and competencies by
accessing a wide range of trainings.

In order to improve the Group's social performance, the expectations
of employees are regularly listened to and discussed. Examples
include the Total Survey, which compiles the views and suggestions
for improvement of tens of thousands of employees every two years.
Initiatives that have allowed employees to participate in building the
“One Total” Company project since 2016 are initiated.

This approach testifies to the Group's desire to entrench a continuous
improvement process that benefits everyone. For more information,
refer to point 5.3 of chapter 5.

1.3.3. The strength of the Group's integrated business model

1.3.3.1 A resilient integrated business model

Oil and gas are commodities that are traded on markets that are
known for their volatility. To manage this constraint as well as possible,
TOTAL opted for an integrated business model with activities
throughout the oil and gas value chain. It extends from exploration
and production, refining, liquefaction, petrochemicals and trading to,
finally, the distribution of products to the end customer.

This business model enables the Company to benefit from synergies
between different activities and from price volatility. It also enables
the Company to manage the bottom of the cycle better and capture
margin when the market improves. Thanks to an integrated business
model, the Group's Upstream activities, which are more dependent
on the price of oil, can complement its Downstream activities,
which — at the bottom of the cycle - enable the Group to benefit from
added value untapped by the Upstream part of the business.

“It is thanks to the effectiveness of our integrated business model for the oil chain that we were able to withstand high oil price volatility.
And it is the same model that we apply to gas and renewable energies, both intended for the generation of electricity.”

Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

1.3.3.2 Arelevant, integrated business model under development on the gas-renewables-electricity chain

In the coming years, according to the IEA, the growth in demand for
electricity is expected to outstrip global demand for energy. In light
of the digitization of the economy, the mobility revolution, and
decentralized generation, many products and services are going to
be “electrified” while, at the same time, a growing share of the world’s
population will benefit from access to electricity.

To fulfill its ambition, the Group intends to apply this integrated
business model to the electricity chain, from the production of low
carbon energy to the generation of electricity.

Preference will be given to three main priorities:

— integration on the gas chain from production to liquefaction and
distribution;

— _ the generation of electricity using gas or renewable energies and
its storage; and

— the trading and the sale of gas or electricity as the producer, or
not.

1.3.4 Geographic presence: key to the Group's future growth

It is thanks to its pioneer spirit and sense of solidarity that TOTAL has
become a worldwide oil and gas major and that it has forged
partnerships of trust with its host countries. Remaining loyal to these
principles means being continuously open to forming new alliances,
key to the Group's development, and creating new opportunities in
the energy sector despite geopolitical uncertainty.

1.3.4.1. From one history to one ambition

The Group is present in over 130 countries and on five continents.
There are three geographic regions in particular that represent the
historical foundations of TOTAL's strategy and today stand out thanks
to the quality of the on-site teams and solid partnerships forged over
time:

— Europe: The core of the Group's knowledge. Europe is home to
the Group’s decision-making center; it is the hub of its research
and innovation work and constitutes a strong industrial base;

— Middle East: the Group began its production activities in this
region and is recognized in the Middle East as a partner of choice
among producing nations and their national oil companies. The
aim of the Group is to develop its activities in all business lines in
this region, even when geopolitical tension rises;

(1) Source: Company data.

It is thanks to a strong and lasting geographic presence that the
Group will be able to meet its goal of becoming a recognized partner
in the sustainable economic and social development of the
communities and regions in which it operates for the creation of
shared value.

— Africa: TOTAL is the largest integrated major notably thanks to
the volume of hydrocarbon production and the number of
Group-branded service stations on the African continent".
TOTAL generates electricity from renewable sources. The Group
intends to remain the continent's partner of choice and to
contribute to its economic and social development through the
creation of shared value.

Today, new regions which are vital for the Group have appeared,
particularly the Americas, which represent a strong growth
opportunity for all of the Group’s businesses, Asia, in order to benefit
from this market's high rate of growth, and Russia, where TOTAL is
working on major industrial projects and maintains a special and
long-term relationship with local industrial players.

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP - INTEGRATED REPORT

Advantages that allow the Group to stand out in a changing energy world

1.3.4.2 Managing geopolitical uncertainty

The world is confronted by political and geopolitical uncertainty
characterized by tension connected to conflict and war in countries
such as Syria, lrag, Yemen and Libya. It is exacerbated by
international terrorism.

In this context, TOTAL intends to develop its activities by putting its
competencies to the benefit of each of the countries where it
operates, by complying with applicable laws and international
economic sanctions where imposed. The Group also ensures that
the capital invested in the most sensitive countries remains at a level
limiting its exposure in each of them.

This is the approach TOTAL intends to pursue and which was
materialized following its decision to carry on investing in Russia while
complying with the economic sanctions imposed by the United States
and Europe, or by its decision to stop its operational activities in Iran
following the re-imposition of U.S. secondary sanctions (refer to point

3.1.9.1 of chapter 3). The Group, if necessary, stops its activities in
countries that become too risky (such as Yemen and Syria).

Loyalty to its partners, particularly during such kind of situations, is
also a strong characteristic of the Group.

TOTAL's activities, wherever they are, are carried out in strict
adherence to applicable laws and the Group's Code of Conduct and
within the framework of compliance and risk management procedures.

By continuing to invest and to supply energy, the Group helps to
maintain conditions that favor the economic development of these
regions.

For more information on risk factors, internal control and risk
management procedures and reasonable vigilance measures
implemented by the Group, refer to points 3.1, 3.3 and 3.5 of
chapter 3.

“During these troubled times, our industry can and must be a stabilizing factor.”

1.3.4.3. A local socio-economic development partner

Safety, integrity, respect for human rights, and societal and
environmental responsibility are principles and values that form part
of the Group's operating processes. If TOTAL is able to build and
develop partnerships throughout the world, it is also because it has
incorporated a local value creation process into its development
model. This process is systematic, professional and a major
competitive advantage.

Based on dialogue with the local population and public and private
players, this process is used to identify development priorities and
create synergies. The Group intends to apply this approach over the
long term to ensure that its major projects create shared prosperity.

Beyond the societal initiatives that are directly related to the Group's
industrial and commercial activities, TOTAL is commited to general
interest measures in the countries where it operates. In the face of
growing inequality and environmental challenges, the Group intends
to strengthen its public interest initiatives and has implemented a
new civic commitment policy in line with its history, its values and its
businesses. It wishes to act in a way that ensures the vitality and
sustainability of the territories in which the Group is present by
favouring actions that benefit young people first.

Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

In order for its corporate citizenship initiatives to have a greater
impact, four areas of focus have been defined as part of the Total
Foundation program driven by the Fondation d'entreprise Total in
France and supported by the Group:

— road safety: committed to safer mobility;

— forests and climate: committed to a more beneficial environment
for humans;

— education and integration of young people: committed to
empowering young people in socially vulnerable situations; and

— dialogue on cultures and heritage: committed to cultural
openness and appreciation of heritage.

Since the end of 2018, the Group has launched Action!, the Group's
Employee Volunteering Program, through which TOTAL gives its
employees the time and means to get involved and contribute to the
development of the areas where the Group is present. It thus allows
employees, on a voluntary basis, the possibility to support, up to
three days per year during their working time, or outside of it, local
solidarity projects within the scope of the Total Foundation program.

Solid results thanks to the integrated business model and strict discipline

1.4 Strong results driven by strong hydrocarbon
production growth and discipline on spend

1.4.1 2018 results

1.4.1.1 Outlook for the 2018 fiscal year

Benefiting from the rise of oil prices to $71/b on average in 2018
compared to $54/b in 2017, while remaining volatile, the Group
reported adjusted net income of $13.6 billion in 2018, an increase of
28%, a return on average capital employed close to 12%, the highest
among the majors, and a pre-dividend breakeven below 30 $/b.

These excellent results reflect the strong growth of more than 8% for
the Group’s hydrocarbon production, which reached a record level
of 2.8 Mboe/d in 2018 and led to a 71% increase in Exploration &
Production’s adjusted net operating income. The year was highlighted
by the start-up of Ichthys in Australia, Yamal LNG in Russia,
deep-water projects Kaombo Norte in Angola and Egina in Nigeria,
as well as the counter-cyclical acquisitions of Maersk Oil and new
offshore licenses in the United Arab Emirates.

In addition, the Group maintained its financial discipline. Net
investments were $15.6 billion in 2018, in line with its objective, and
$4.2 billion in cost reduction was achieved. Debt-adjusted cash flow
(DACF) was $26 billion in 2018, driven largely by the 31% increase
in cash flow from Exploration & Production. The Group's balance
sheet was solid with a gearing ratio of 15.5%, below the target limit
of 20%.

The Group is continuing to expand along the value chain of integrated
gas and low-carbon electricity. With its acquisition of Engie’s LNG
assets TOTAL is the second largest publicly-traded player in the LNG
business, and its position will be strengthened with the 2019 start-up
of the Cameron LNG project. In addition, the Group accelerated its
growth in low-carbon electricity, notably with the acquisition of Direct
Energie.

In an environment of lower European refining margins, the Downstream
relied on the availability of its units and the diversity of its portfolio to
generate $6.5 billion of cash flow and profitability of more than 25%.
The Group is continuing to implement its strategy for growth in
petrochemicals by launching projects in the United States, Saudi
Arabia, South Korea and Algeria. TOTAL has also continued to
expand Marketing & Services in fast-growing areas, notably in
Mexico, Brazil and Angola.

Conforming to the shareholder return policy announced in February
2018, the Group increased the 2018 dividend by 3.2% and bought
back $1.5 billion of its shares in 2018. Given the solid financial
position, which is benefiting from growing cash flow, the Board of
Directors confirmed the shareholder return policy for 2019. It plans
to increase the interim dividend by 3.1% to 0.66 euro per share, end
the scrip dividend option following the general assembly, and continue
the share buyback policy in the amount of $1.5 billion in a 60 $/b
environment.

“An ajusted net income of $13.6 billion, with oil prices averaging $71, is better than in 2014, when it had reached $99. These excellent
results reflect the strong growth of more than 8% for the Group’s hydrocarbon production, and our financial discipline.”

Direct Energie and the LNG business of Engie was mainly responsible
for the negative cash flow from operations in 2018.

1.4.1.7 TOTALS.A. 2017 results

Net income for TOTAL S.A., the parent company, was €5,485 million
in 2018 compared to €6,634 million in 2017.

1.4.1.8 Proposed dividend

The Board of Directors met on February 6, 2019 and decided to
propose to the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting, which will be held
on May 29, 2019, an annual dividend of €2.56/share for 2018, a
3.2% increase compared to 2017 conforming to the shareholder
return policy announced in February 2018.

In the context of the solid financial position of the Group, the Board
of Directors also decided not to propose to the Combined
Shareholders’ Meeting which will be held on May 29, 2019, the
renewal of the scrip dividend option.

The Board of Directors will thus propose to the General Meeting,
which will be held on May 29, 2019, to approve the final dividend
payment, exclusively in cash, for the 2018 fiscal year as well as for
the interim dividends that the Board of Directors may decide for the
2019 fiscal year.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018


--- Page 18 ---

The Group's net cash flow after working capital changes was
$9,135 million in 2018 compared to $10,683 million in 2017. This
variation is mainly due to the increase in cash flow from operations
driven by the rise in hydrocarbon prices, the strong hydrocarbon
production growth in the Exploration & Production’s segment offset
by the increase in investments, net of divestments, in 2018 compared
to 2017. The Group confirmed its financial strength with a gearing
ratio of 15.5% at the end of 2018.

1.4.2.3. Borrowing requirements
and funding structure

The Group's policy consists of incurring long-term debt at a floating
rate or at a fixed rate depending on the Group’s general corporate
needs and interest rates. Debt is incurred mainly in dollars or euros.
Long-term interest rate and currency swaps may be used to hedge
bonds at their issuance in order to create a variable or fixed rate
synthetic debt. In order to partially modify the interest rate structure
of the long-term debt, TOTAL may also enter into long-term interest
rate swaps.

The non-current financial debt is generally raised by the corporate
treasury entities either directly in dollars or euros, or in other
currencies which are then exchanged for dollars or euros through
currency swaps at issuance, depending on general corporate needs.

As of December 31, 2018, the Group's long-term financial debt, after
taking into account the effect of currency and interest rate swaps,
was 97% in dollars and 54% at floating rates. In 2017, these ratios
were 95% and 55%, respectively.

In addition to its ongoing bond issuance programs, in 2015 and
2016 TOTAL S.A. issued perpetual subordinated notes in several
tranches: on February 19, 2015, €5 billion in two tranches; on
May 11, 2016, €1.75 billion in one tranche; and on September 29,
2016, €2.5 billion in two tranches.

In accordance with IAS 32 provisions “Financial instruments —
Presentation”, given the nature of these notes, they have been
recognized in the accounts as equity.

In addition, on November 25, 2015, TOTAL S.A. issued a $1.2 billion
bond combining cash-settled convertible bonds indexed on TOTAL's
share performance and the purchase of stock options to hedge the
risk of additional costs related to this indexation. This combination
creates a non-dilutive synthetic instrument equivalent to a standard
bond. At maturity, all flows are settled in cash and limited to the
nominal amount.

The Group has established standards for market transactions under
which bank counterparties must be approved in advance, based on
an assessment of the counterparty’s financial soundness (multi-criteria
analysis including a review of the market capitalization and of the Credit
Default Swap (CDS), its ratings with Standard & Poor's and Moody's,
which must be of high quality, and its overall financial condition).

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP - INTEGRATED REPORT

Solid results thanks to the integrated business model and strict discipline

An overall authorized credit limit is set for each bank and is allocated
among the subsidiaries and the Group's central treasury entities
according to their needs.

To reduce the market valuation risk on its commitments, in particular
for swaps put in place on the back of bond issues, the Group also
entered into margin call contracts with its counterparties. In addition,
since December 21, 2018, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 648/2012
on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories
(EMIR), some of the interest rate swaps entered into by the Group
are now being centrally cleared.

1.4.2.4 External financing available

As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of the major
committed credit facilities granted by international banks to the
Group's companies (including TOTAL S.A.) was $13,191 million
(compared to $12,323 million on December 31, 2017), of which
$12,599 million were unused (compared to $12,205 million unused
on December 31, 2017).

TOTAL S.A. has committed credit facilities granted by international
banks allowing it to benefit from significant liquidity reserves. As of
December 31, 2018, these credit facilities amounted to $11,515 million
(compared to $11,478 million on December 31, 2017), of which
$11,515 million were unused (compared to $11,478 million unused
on December 31, 2017).

The agreements for credit facilities granted to TOTAL S.A. do not
contain conditions related to the Company's financial ratios, to its
financial ratings from specialized agencies, or to the occurrence of
events that could have a material adverse effect on its financial
position.

Credit facilities granted to Group companies other than TOTAL S.A.
are not intended to finance the Group's general corporate needs;
they are intended to finance either the general needs of the borrowing
affiliate or a specific project.

As of December 31, 2018, no restrictions applied to the use of the
Group companies’ funding sources (including TOTAL S.A.) that could
significantly impact the Group's activities, directly or indirectly.

1.4.2.5 Anticipated sources of financing

Investments, working capital, dividend payments and buybacks of
its own shares by the Company are financed by cash flow from
operations, asset disposals and, if necessary, by net borrowings.

For the coming years and based on the current financing conditions,
the Company intends to maintain this approach to the financing of
the Group's investments and activities.

1.4.3. Trends and outlook

1.4.3.1 Outlook

Since the start of 2019, Brent has traded around $60/b in a context
of oil supply and demand near the record-high level of 100 Mb/d. In
a volatile environment, the Group is pursuing its strategy for integrated
growth along the oil, gas and low-carbon electricity chains.

The Group has clear visibility on its 2019 cash flow, supported by
the strong contribution of project start-ups in 2018 and recent
acquisitions.

The Group maintains financial discipline to reduce its breakeven to
remain profitable across a broader range of environments. In
particular, it is targeting cost reductions of $4.7 billion, projected net
investments of $15-16 billion in 2019 and a production cost target
of 5.5 $/boe.

In Exploration & Production, production is expected to grow by more
than 9% in 2019, thanks to the ramp-ups of Kaombo Norte, Egina
and Ichthys plus the start-ups of lara 1 in Brazil, Kaombo South in
Angola, Culzean in the UK and Johan Sverdrup in Norway.
Determined to take advantage of the favorable cost environment, the
Group plans to launch projects in 2019, notably including Mero 2 in
Brazil, Tilenga and Kingfisher in Uganda and Arctic LNG 2 in Russia.

The Group is pursuing its strategy for profitable growth along the
integrated gas and low-carbon electricity chains. Effective 2019, the
Group will report the new iGRP segment (integrated Gas, Renewables
& Power) which combines the Gas, Renewables & Power segment
with the upstream gas and LNG activities currently reported within
the Exploration & Production segment.

Affected by an abundance of available products, European refining
margins have been very volatile since the start of the year. In 2019,
the Downstream will continue to rely on its diversified portfolio, notably
its integrated Refining & Chemical platforms in the U.S. and
Asia-Middle East as well as its non-cyclical Marketing & Services
segment.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

In this context, the Group will continue to implement its shareholder
return policy announced in February 2018, by increasing the dividend
in 2019 by 3.1%, in line with the objective to increase the dividend
by 10% over the 2018-20 period. Taking into account its strong
financial position, the Group will eliminate the scrip dividend option
from June 2019. Within the framework of its program to buy back
$5 billion of shares over the 2018-20 period, the Group expects to
buy back $1.5 billion of its shares in 2019 in a 60 $/b Brent
environment.

1.4.3.2 Risks and uncertainties

Due to the nature of its business, the Group's activities remain subject
to the market risks (sensitivity to the environmental parameters of the
oil and financial markets), industrial and environmental risks related
to its operations, and to political or geopolitical risks stemming from
the global presence of most of its activities.

Detailed information is given in the Risk Factors section (point 3.1 of
chapter 3) of this Registration Document. For more information on
internal control and risk management procedures, also refer to point
3.3 of chapter 3.

1.4.4 Significant changes

Except for the events mentioned above in point 1.4, in the Business
overview (chapter 2), and in the description of legal and arbitration
procedures (point 3.2 of chapter 3), no significant changes to the
Group's financial or commercial situation have occurred since
December 31, 2018, the end of the last fiscal year for which audited
financial statements have been published by the Company.

Since the fall in oil prices in 2014, the Group continues to select its
investments very carefully, in line with its strategy. These investments
are dedicated to:

— the development of new upstream and downstream facilities in
order to benefit from a favorable cost environment;

The portfolio includes transverse programs developed at all the R&D
centers and programs specific to the various businesses. For
example, the purpose of the CCUS (carbon capture, usage and
storage) transverse program is to enable the Group to become a
major player in this area and throughout the value chain so that it can
contribute to the reduction in global CO, emissions and prepare new
business opportunities.

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP - INTEGRATED REPORT

An organizational structure to support the Group's ambition

1.5.3.2 Support for global initiatives

Aside from complying with national regulations in force in every
country where the Group operates, TOTAL reiterates each year, since
2002, its support for the United Nations Global Compact, of which it
is one of the companies recognized as LEAD. The Group also made
a commitment to respect the UN Guiding Principles for Business
and Human Rights following their adoption in 2011.

The challenges posed by climate change require a collective effort.
The Group has played an active role in various international initiatives
that involve the private and the public sectors to bring about notably:

— carbon pricing (the World Bank’s Carbon Pricing Leadership
Coalition, Caring for Climate - United Nations Global Compact,
Paying for Carbon call: TOTAL and five other industry leaders);

— the end of routine flaring of associated gas (the World Bank's
Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative);

— _ control over methane emissions (Oil & Gas Methane Partnership
of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, the Oil & Gas Climate
Initiative in cooperation with UN Environment and EDF, etc.); and

— greater transparency: support of the recommendations from the
G20 Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

TOTAL also actively supports collaborative and multi-stakeholder
initiatives in areas in which the coordinated involvement of
governments, companies and civil society is key to global progress,
particularly:

— financial transparency: the Group has adhered to the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EIT!) since its launch in 2002;

— the fight against corruption: TOTAL joined the Partnering Against
Corruption Initiative (PACI) in 2016 and the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer now sits on the Board of PACI (“PACI Vanguard”);

— the challenge of security and respect for human rights by being
a member of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human
Rights (VPSHR) since 2012;

— diversity: TOTAL signed in 2010 the “Women’s Empowerment
Principles - Equality Means Business” set out by the United
Nations Global Compact, and in 2018 it signed the pledge for
diversity as part of the European Roundtable of Industrialists;

— biodiversity: TOTAL joined in 2018 the Act4Nature initiative and
made commitments to protect biodiversity;

— the circular economy: TOTAL is a founding member of the
Alliance to End Plastic Waste, launched in 2019, which brings
together companies in the plastics and consumer goods value
chain to provide solutions for the disposal of plastic waste in the
environment, especially in oceans, and to promote their recycling
in a circular economy;

— better access to energy for populations of emerging countries
through a partnership with SE4All;

— the reduction of inequalities through the development of social
dialogue to favor more inclusive economic growth: TOTAL was
one of the first French companies to adhere to the Global Deal
initiative at the end of 2017.

1.6.2 An operational structure

On an operational level, the Group’s businesses are organized in
business segments, which receive assistance from the corporate
functional divisions.

As of December 31, 2018, the Group's organization was centered
around four business segments, i.e., Exploration & Production, Gas,
Renewables & Power, Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services:

— the Exploration & Production segment encompasses the Group's
exploration and production activities in more than 50 countries.
The Group produces oil and gas in approximately 30 countries;

— the Gas, Renewables & Power segment spearheads the Group's
ambition in low-carbon energies. It comprises gas activities that
are conducted downstream of the production process and
concerns natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG), as well as power generation, gas and
power trading and marketing. It also develops the Group's
renewable energy activities (excluding biotechnologies) and the
power storage. Energy efficiency activities are represented
through a dedicated Innovation & Energy Efficiency division;

— the Refining & Chemicals segment is a large industrial segment
that encompasses refining and petrochemical activities and
Hutchinson's operations. It also includes oil Trading & Shipping
activities;

— the Marketing & Services segment includes worldwide supply
and marketing activities in the oil products and services field.

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP - INTEGRATED REPORT

An organizational structure to support the Group's ambition

TOTAL S.A. has not taken any other stake in companies with their
registered office in France representing more than one-twentieth,
one-tenth, one-fifth, one-third or one-half of the capital of these
companies or has not obtained control of such companies.

In order to improve efficiency, reduce costs and create value within
the Group, a specific branch, Total Global Services (TGS), pools the
various segments’ support services (Accounting, Purchasing,
Information Systems, Training, Human Resources Administration and
Facilities Management). The entities that make up TGS operate as
service companies for internal clients across the business segments
and Holding.

Finally, the various Corporate entities are mainly grouped into two
divisions:

— the People & Social Responsibility division consists of: the Human
Resources division, the Health, Safety and Environment division,
which combines HSE departments across the different segments
to establish a strong, unified environmental and safety model,
the Security division, and the Civil Society Engagement Division;

— the Strategy-Innovation division is made of: the Strategy &
Climate division (responsible notably for ensuring that climate is
incorporated in the strategy), the Public Affairs division, the Audit
& Internal Control division, the Research & Development division
(which coordinates all of the Group's R&D activities and notably
transversal programs), the Technology Experts division and the
Digital division.

— +9% for start-ups and ramp-ups on new projects, notably Yamal
LNG, Moho Nord, Fort Hills, Kashagan, Kaombo Norte and
Ichthys;

— +3% portfolio effect. The addition of Mzersk Oil, Al Shaheen in
Qatar, Waha in Libya, Lapa and lara in Brazil, as well as the
acquisition of an additional 0.5% of Novatek, were partially offset
by the expiration of the Mahakam permit at the end of 2017 and
the sales of Visund in Norway and Rabi in Gabon;

BUSINESS OVERVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018

Exploration & Production segment

2.1.1 Presentation of the segment

Exploration & Production (E&P)'s mission is to discover and develop
oil and gas fields in order to meet a growing energy demand driven
by non-OECD countries. Safety is a core value for that mission.

In an environment marked by the strong volatility of hydrocarbon
prices, E&P's strategy is to develop an oil and gas production model
that is resilient (i.e., able to withstand a long period of low oil and gas
prices), profitable and sustainable.

The deployment of the strategy is based on three main levers:

— increase profitability: E&P strives to maximize the value of its
assets through operational excellence and to ensure strict
investment discipline by being selective in the sanctioning of new
projects. In addition, E&P continues to restructure or sell the
least efficient assets in its portfolio;

— develop operational excellence: in order to ensure its resilience,
E&P continues to reduce costs, improve the efficiency of its
facilities and start up projects on time and within budget. E&P.
also seeks to minimize the environmental impact of its activities;
and

— renew reserves, through exploration as well as by accessing
already discovered resources, building on E&P's competitive
advantages in terms of geographical spread and technical skills.

2.1.2 Exploration and development

TOTAL evaluates exploration opportunities based on a variety of
geological, technical, political, economic (including tax and
contractual terms) environmental and societal factors.

The exploration strategy deployed since 2015 aims to prioritize the
most promising drill targets with a view to creating value. The Group
plans balanced exploration investments:

— 50% for emerging basins, where the presence of hydrocarbons
is already proven;

— 35% for exploration in mature hydrocarbon plays; and

— 15% for high-potential frontier basins.

2.1.3 Reserves

The definitions used for proved, proved developed and proved
undeveloped oil and gas reserves are in accordance with the United
States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 4-10 of
Regulation S-X as amended by the SEC Modernization of Oil
and Gas Reporting release issued on December 31, 2008.
Proved reserves are estimated using geological and engineering data
to determine with reasonable certainty whether the crude oil or natural
gas in known reservoirs is economically producible under existing
regulatory, economic and operating conditions.

TOTAL's oil and gas reserves are consolidated annually, taking
into account, among other factors, levels of production, field

E&P put 10 major projects into production in 2018. Thanks to a
significant decrease of its capital investments, which peaked in 2013,
E&P restored some flexibility that enabled it to take some
opportunities, with, in particular, in 2018 the acquisition of assets in
Brazil, Libya and the United States, the extension of assets in Abu
Dhabi and the acquisition of Maersk Olie og Gas A/S, (Meersk Oil),
which has assets in ten countries, and to launch new projects, taking
advantage of the lower costs in the current environment.

For the period 2018-2020, E&P has already launched, or plans to
launch, numerous projects with a potential aggregate output in
excess of 700 kboe/d.

All these actions are expected to increase production by an average
of 6-7% per year for the period 2017-2020, in line with the production
growth target of 5% per year on average between 2017 and 2022.

In order to take account of issues related to climate change in its
strategy, E&P is focusing its oil investments on low break-even
projects, developing the production of gas, integrating a CO, price in
its investment decisions and developing expertise in technologies for
carbon capture, use and storage.

In 2018, exploration expenditure by all E&P subsidiaries was
$1.2 billion, mainly in the United States, Guyana, the United Kingdom,
Norway, Myanmar, French Guiana, Mexico, South Africa, Azerbaijan
and Nigeria compared to $1.2 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016.

Organic investments") by all E&P subsidiaries were $9.2 billion® in
2018, compared to $11.3 billion® in 2017 and $14.5 billion in 2016,
and were mainly in Australia, Norway, Angola, the United Kingdom,
the Republic of Congo, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Nigeria,
Canada, the United States, Iraq, Italy and Uganda.

reassessments, additional reserves from discoveries and extensions,
disposal and acquisitions of reserves and other economic factors.

Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to TOTAL's proved
reserves, proved developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves
and production reflects the Group's entire share of such reserves or
such production. TOTAL’s worldwide proved reserves include the
proved reserves of its consolidated entities as well as its proportionate
share of the proved reserves of equity affiliates. The reserves
estimation process involves making subjective judgments.
Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact measurements
and are subject to revision under well-established control procedures.

(1) For Exploration & Production, organic investments include exploration investments, net development investments and net financial investments (excluding acquisitions).

(2) Excluding the Group's Gas activities.

The reserves booking process requires, among other actions:

— that an internal peer review of technical evaluations is carried out
to ensure that the SEC definitions and guidance are followed;
and

— that management makes the necessary funding commitments
to their development prior to booking.

For further information concerning the reserves and their evaluation
process, refer to points 9.1 and 9.2 of chapter 9.

2.1.3.1 Proved reserves for 2018, 2017 and 2016

In accordance with the amended Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, proved
reserves at December 31 are calculated using a 12-month average
price determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month of the relevant year,
unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding
escalations based upon future conditions. The average reference
prices for Brent crude for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were, respectively,
$71.43/b, $54.36/b and $42.82/b.

As of December 31, 2018, TOTAL’s combined proved reserves of oil
and gas were 12,050 Mboe (70% of which were proved developed
reserves). Liquids (crude oil, condensates, natural gas liquids and
bitumen) represented approximately 50% of these reserves and
natural gas 50%. These reserves were located in Europe and Central
Asia (mainly in Kazakhstan, Norway, The United Kingdom and
Russia), Africa (mainly in Angola, Nigeria and the Republic of Congo),
the Americas (mainly in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the United States
and Venezuela), the Middle East and North Africa (mainly in the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Yemen), and Asia-Pacific (mainly in
Australia).

Gas and associated products (condensates and natural gas liquids)
represented approximatively 57% of the reserves whilst crude oil and
bitumen the remaining 43%.

Discoveries of new fields and extensions of existing fields added
1,421 Mboe to TOTAL’s proved reserves during the three years 2016,
2017 and 2018 before deducting production and sales of reserves
and adding any reserves acquired during this period. The net level of
reserve revisions during this 3-year period is +1,383 Mboe, which

2.1.4 Production

The average daily production of liquids and natural gas was
2,775 kboe/d in 2018 compared to 2,566 kboe/d in 2017 and
2,452 kboe/d in 2016. Liquids represented approximately 56% and
natural gas approximately 44% of TOTAL's overall production in 2018.

Gas and associated products (condensates and natural gas liquids)
represented approximately 50% of TOTAL’s overall production in
2018, whilst crude oil and bitumen the remaining 50%.

The tables on the following pages set forth TOTAL’s annual and
average daily production of liquids and natural gas by geographic
area and for each of the last three fiscal years.

Consistent with industry practice, TOTAL often holds a percentage
interest in its fields rather than a 100% interest, with the balance

2.1.5 Delivery commitments

The majority of TOTAL’s natural gas production is sold under
long-term contracts. However, most of its North American and United
Kingdom production, and part of its production from Denmark, the
Netherlands, Norway and Russia, is sold on the spot market.

The long-term contracts under which TOTAL sells its natural gas usually
provide for a price related to, among other factors, average crude oil
and other petroleum product prices, as well as, in some cases, a
cost-of-living index. Though the price of natural gas tends to fluctuate
in line with crude oil prices, a slight delay may occur before changes
in crude oil prices are reflected in long-term natural gas prices.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018

Exploration & Production segment

was mainly due to the overall positive revisions in field behaviors and
to the net impact of the changes in hydrocarbon prices in 2016
(decrease), in 2017 (increase) and in 2018 (increase) that led either to
a reserves decrease or increase resulting from shorter or longer
producing life of certain producing fields and from partial debooking
or rebooking of proved undeveloped reserves due to economic
reasons, partially offset by reserves increase or decrease on fields
with producing sharing or risked service contracts.

As of December 31, 2017, TOTAL’s combined proved reserves of oil
and gas were 11,475 Mboe (61% of which were proved developed
reserves) compared to 11,518 Mboe (58% of which were proved
developed reserves) as of December 31, 2016.

2.1.3.2 Reserve sensitivity to oil and gas prices

Changes in the price used as a reference for the proved reserves
estimation result in non-proportionate inverse changes in proved
reserves associated with production sharing and risked service
contracts (which together represent approximately 18% of TOTAL's
reserves as of December 31, 2018). Under such contracts, TOTAL is
entitled to a portion of the production, the sale of which is meant to
cover expenses incurred by the Group. The more the oil prices
decrease, the more the number of barrels necessary to cover the
same amount of expenses. Moreover, the number of barrels
economically producible under these contracts may vary according
to criteria such as cumulative production, the rate of return on
investment or the income-cumulative expenses ratio. This increase
in reserves is partly offset by a reduction of the duration over which
fields are economically producible. However, the effect of a reduction
of the duration of production is usually inferior to the impact of the
drop in prices in production sharing contracts or risked service
contracts. As a result, lower prices usually lead to an increase in
TOTAL's reserves, and vice versa. In Canada, a decrease in the
reference price per barrel leads to a decrease in the volume of

being held by joint-venture partners (which may include other
international oil companies, state-owned oil companies or
government entities). The Group's entities may frequently act as an
operator (the party responsible for technical production) on the
acreage in which it holds an interest. For further information, refer to
the table on producing assets by geographical zone in point 2.1.8 of
this chapter.

The Trading & Shipping division of TOTAL’s Refining & Chemicals
segment marketed in 2018, as in 2017 and 2016, substantially all of
the liquids production from TOTAL’s Exploration & Production
segment(refer to table regarding Trading’s crude oil sales and supply
and petroleum products sales in point 2.3.2.1 of this chapter).

Some of TOTAL's long-term contracts, such as in Bolivia, Nigeria,
Norway, Thailand and Qatar, specify the delivery of quantities of
natural gas that may or may not be fixed and determinable.
Such delivery commitments vary substantially, both in duration and
scope, from contract to contract throughout the world. For example,
in some cases, contracts require delivery of natural gas on an
as-needed basis, and, in other cases, contracts call for the delivery
of varied amounts of natural gas over different periods of time.
Nevertheless, TOTAL estimates the fixed and determinable
quantity of gas to be delivered over the period 2019-2021 to be

4,751 Bcf. The Group expects to satisfy most of these obligations
through the production of its proved reserves of natural gas, with,

if needed, additional sourcing from spot market purchases (refer to
points 9.1 and 9.2 of chapter 9).

2.1.6 Contractual framework of activities

Licenses, permits and contracts governing the Group entities’
ownership of oil and gas interests have terms that vary from country
to country and are generally granted by or entered into with a
government entity or a state-owned company or sometimes with
private owners. These agreements usually take the form of
concessions or production sharing contracts.

In the framework of oil concession agreements, the oil company (or
consortium) owns the assets and the facilities and is entitled to the
entire production. In exchange, the operating risks, costs and
investments are the oil company’s or the consortium’s responsibility
and it agrees to remit to the relevant host country, usually the owner
of the subsoil resources, a production-based royalty, income tax,
and possibly other taxes that may apply under local tax legislation.

The production sharing contract (“PSC") involves a more complex
legal framework than the concession agreement: it defines the terms
and conditions of production sharing and sets the rules governing
the cooperation between the company (the contractor) or consortium
(the contracting group) in possession of the license and the host
country, which is generally represented by a state-owned company.
The latter can thus be involved in operating decisions, cost
accounting and production allocation. The contractor (or contractor
group) undertakes the execution and financing, at its own risk, of all
exploration, development or operational activities. In exchange, it is
entitled to a portion of the production, known as “cost oil", the sale
of which is intended to cover its incurred expenses (capital and
operating costs). The balance of production, known as “profit oil”, is
then shared in varying proportions, between the contractor (or the
contracting group), on the one hand, and the host country or
state-owned company, on the other hand.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

Today, concession agreements and PSCs can coexist, sometimes in
the same country. Even though there are other contractual models,
TOTAL'’s license portfolio is comprised mainly of concession
agreements.

On most licenses, the partners and authorities of the host country,
often assisted by international accounting firms, perform joint-venture
and PSC cost audits and ensure the observance of contractual
obligations.

In some countries, TOTAL has also signed contracts called “risked
service contracts”, which are similar to PSCs. However, the profit oil
is replaced by a defined or determinable cash monetary remuneration,
agreed by contract, which depends notably on field performance
parameters such as the amount of barrels produced.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to
authorization granted by public authorities (licenses), which are
granted for specific and limited periods of time and include an
obligation to relinquish a large portion, or the entire portion in case of
failure, of the area covered by the license at the end of the exploration
period.

TOTAL pays taxes on income generated from its oil and gas
production and sales activities under its concessions, PSCs and
risked service contracts, as provided for by local regulations.
In addition, depending on the country, TOTAL's production and sales
activities may be subject to a number of other taxes, fees and
withholdings, including special petroleum taxes and fees. The taxes
imposed on oil and gas production and sales activities are generally
substantially higher than those imposed on other industrial or
commercial businesses.

2.1.9 Activities by geographical zone

The information below describes the Group's main exploration and
production activities presented by geographical zone", without
detailing all of the assets held by TOTAL. In each zone, the countries
are presented in decreasing order of production. The capacities
referred to herein are expressed on a 100% basis, regardless of the
Group's stake in the asset®!.

2.1.9.1 Europe and Central Asia

In 2018, TOTAL’s production in the zone of Europe and Central
Asia was 909 kboe/d, representing 33% of the Group’s total
production, compared to 761 kboe/d in 2017 and 757 kboe/d in
2016. The two main producing countries in this zone in 2018
were Russia and Norway.

In Russia, where the largest percentage of TOTAL's proved reserves
are located (21% as of December 31, 2018), the Group's production
was 389 kboe/d in 2018, compared to 318 kboe/d in 2017 and
335 kboe/d in 2016. This production comes from TOTAL's stake in
PAO Novatek®), as well as from the Termokarstovoye “! and Kharyaga
fields (20%) and, since the end of 2017, the Yamal LNG project
(20%). Since 2015, Russia has been the leading country to the
Group's production.

TOTAL participates in the Yamal LNG project. In 2013, the company
OAO Yamal LNG®) launched this project aimed at developing the
onshore field of South Tambey (gas and condensates) located on the
Yamal Peninsula, and at building a three-train gas liquefaction plant
with a total LNG capacity of 16.5 Mt/y. The Yamal LNG project's
financing was finalized in 2016 in compliance with applicable
regulations. At the end of 2017, the Yamal LNG plant started
production with the first shipment aboard “Christophe de Margerie”.
The second liquefaction train of the Yamal plant, with a capacity of
5.5 Mt/y, produced its first shipment of LNG in August 2018. The
third liquefaction train started production in November 2018, more
than one year ahead of the schedule planned when the project was.
launched. A fourth liquefaction train at small capacity (0.9 Mt/y), using
PAO Novatek proprietary technology, is under construction.

In May 2018, TOTAL signed an agreement with Novatek to acquire a
stake in Arctic LNG 2, the giant new LNG project led by Novatek.
The agreement provides for the acquisition by TOTAL of a direct
10% interest in the project, which could be increased to 15% under
certain conditions. The interest acquisition is effective further to the
signing of the final contracts beginning of March 2019. Located on
the Gydan Peninsula, facing Yamal, Arctic LNG 2 will have a
production capacity of 19.8 Mt/y, and will use the hydrocarbon
resources from the giant Utrenneye onshore gas and condensate
field. The project will use the new gravity-based structures technology,
with the installation of three gravity-based structures in Ob Bay that
will host the three liquefaction trains of 6.6 Mt/y capacity each. It
should benefit from possible synergies with the Yamal LNG project.
The agreement also enables TOTAL to acquire a direct stake of
between 10% and 15% in all future Novatek LNG projects on the
Yamal and Gydan peninsulas.

In September 2018, TOTAL increased its stake from 18.9% to 19.4%
of Novatek’s share capital, which is the maximum set forth in the
initial 2011 agreement.

Consortium (DUC), following the finalization of the acquisition of
Meersk Oil in March 2018. In September 2018, TOTAL also signed
an agreement to acquire the entire capital of Chevron Denmark Inc.
This acquisition, which is expected to be closed in 2019, will increase
the Groupe’s interest in DUC to 43.2%. In 2018, the Group's
production was 42 kboe/d. The 100%-operated production comes
from two main DUC assets: the Dan/Halfdan and Gorm/Tyra fields.
The Tyra field facilities constitute the main gas treatment hub in
Denmark. The Tyra field must be redeveloped due to subsidence
problems, and is expected to restart in 2022.

In the Netherlands, the Group's production was 18 kboe/d in 2018
compared to 20 kboe/d in 2017 and 25 kboe/d in 2016.
This decrease is due to natural field decline. In 2018, TOTAL holds
interests in 22 offshore production licenses, including 18 that it
operates. In 2017, production on platforms L7 and F15 stopped and
the platforms will be dismantled.

In Italy, TOTAL holds stakes in the Tempa Rossa field (50%, operator)
located on the Gorgoglione concession (Basilicate region), as well as

35 kboe/d and the gas produced will supply Azerbaijan's domestic
market. Drilling operations started in February 2018 and the main
facilities construction contracts were awarded in July and October
2018. The role of operator was transferred to the joint TOTAL and
SOCAR company (JOCAP) in August 2018.

In Bulgaria, where TOTAL has been present since 2012, the Group
drilled the Polshkov deep offshore exploration well in 2016 on the
Han Asparuh Block (40%, operator), with a surface area of
14,220 km?, 100 km offshore in the Black Sea, which revealed the
presence of oil. The second and third wells drilled in 2017 and 2018
accordingly were expensed in 2018.

onshore natural gas resources, on Block 6 in the Greater Barik area.

In Iraq, the Group's production was 19 kboe/d in 2018 compared to
16 kboe/d in 2017 and 18 kboe/d in 2016. TOTAL holds a 22.5%
stake in the risked service contract for the Halfaya field, located in
Missan province. Following development studies in 2016, the decision
to develop phase 3 of the project to increase production to 400 kb/d
was taken in 2017. The new facilities started up at the end of 2018.

Following the finalization of the acquisition of Mzersk Oil in March
2018, TOTAL holds an 18% interest in the Sarsang field in Iraqi
Kurdistan.

In Yemen, there has been no Group production since 2016. Due to
the security conditions in the vicinity of Balnaf, Yemen LNG, in which
the Group holds a stake of 39.62%, stopped its commercial
production and export of LNG in April 2015, when Yemen LNG
declared force majeure to its various stakeholders. The plant is in a
preservation mode.

TOTAL holds various stakes in four onshore exploration licenses, for
which a situation of force majeure has been declared. In addition,
TOTAL signed an agreement to sell its interest in Block 5 (Marib
Basin, Jannah license, 15%) in 2018. This agreement remains subject
to the authorities’ approval.

TOTAL also holds interests in exploration licenses in Cyprus and Egypt.

2.1.9.4 Americas

In 2018, TOTAL’s production in the zone of the Americas was
389 kboe/d, representing 14% of the Group's total production,
compared to 348 kboe/d in 2017 and 279 kboe/d in 2016.
The two main producing countries in this zone in 2018 were the
United States and Canada.

In the United States, the Group's production was 119 kboe/d in
2018 compared to 123 kboe/d in 2017 and 86 kboe/d in 2016.

In the Gulf of Mexico, TOTAL holds interests in the Tahiti (17%) and
Chinook (33.33%) deep offshore fields, and, thanks to the acquisition
of Meersk Oil in March 2018, in the Jack (25%) field. The Tahiti Vertical
Expansion (TVEX) project, launched in 2016, started production in
June 2018, enabling the field to maintain a level of production of
about 100 kboe/d. Since the end of 2014, the Jack field has been
sending its production to a semi-submersible platform shared with
the Saint-Malo and Julia fields.

In January 2018, TOTAL acquired 12.5% of the Anchor discovery,
when it took over Samson Offshore Anchor LLC. As part of the
process to wind up Cobalt International Energy in April 2018, TOTAL,

BUSINESS OVERVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018

Exploration & Production segment

In Canada, the Group's production increased to 95 kboe/d in 2018
compared to 59 kboe/d in 2017 and 34 kboe/d in 2016. This increase
is due:

— to the start-up in January 2018 and the rapid ramp-up during
the year of production of the Fort Hills oil sands mining extraction
project. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the project reached levels
close to its plateau of 180 kboe/d. Following several interest
disposals in 2015 and 2017, TOTAL now holds a 24.58% stake
in Fort Hills; and

— to the strong operational performance of the Surmont SAGD")
oil sands project, in which TOTAL holds a 50% stake.

In September 2018, TOTAL sold its 38.25% stake in the Joslyn
project, which was suspended in 2014.

In Argentina, TOTAL operated approximately 30%! of the country’s
gas production in 2018. The Group’s production was 79 kboe/d in
2018, compared to 76 kboe/d in 2017 and 78 kboe/d in 2016:

— in Tierra del Fuego, on the CMA-1 concession, TOTAL operates.
the Ara and Cafiadon Alfa Complex onshore fields and the Hidra,
Carina and Aries offshore fields (37.5%). In 2016, TOTAL started
production on the Vega Pleyade offshore gas and condensates
field (37.5%, operator), which has a production capacity of
350 Mcf/d; and

— in the Neuquén onshore Basin, the Group holds interests in
10 licenses and operates 6 of them, including Aguada Pichana
Este and San Roque, where production has already started.
Three shale gas and oil pilot projects were launched: the first on
the Aguada Pichana Block, where production started mid-2015
in order to produce gas; the second on the Rincén la Ceniza
Block, located on the gas and condensate portion of Vaca Muerta
(45%, operator), where production started in 2016; and the third
on the Aguada San Roque Block (24.71%, operator), which was.
launched in 2017 to produce oil.

Following the good results of the Aguada Pichana pilot project and a
reduction in drilling costs, the first phase of development of the giant
Vaca Muerta shale play was launched in 2017 in the eastern part of
the Block. In this project, all the partners of Aguada Pichana, Total
Austral S.A. (27.27%, operator), YPF S.A. (27.27%), Wintershall
Energia S.A. (27.27%) and Panamerican Energy LLC (18.18%) have
signed an agreement to split the Block in two. This agreement has
enabled TOTAL to remain the operator of the Aguada Pichana Este
Block, with 27.27% of the conventional part (Mulichinco), and 41%
of the Unconventional part (Vaca Muerta), and to adjust its interest in
the Aguada Pichana Oeste, which is now non-operated, to 25%.

A second development phase was launched on the Aguada Pichana
Este —- Vaca Muerta Block in July 2018. It should allow the production
plateau to reach 500 Mcf/d, which corresponds to the capacity of
the existing plant.

On the Aguada Pichana Oeste Block, TOTAL (25%) is taking part in
the pilot, which came into production in 2017.

The wells of the first pilot on San Roque have been in production
since July 2018 and the drilling of a second series of wells started in
July 2018.

The initial results of the pilot development on the Rincon la Ceniza
Block are encouraging at this stage. The delineation well drilled in
2016 on the La Escalonada Block in order to test the oil portion of
the formation has also demonstrated good productivity.

In Bolivia, the Group's production, mainly gas, was 42 kboe/d in
2018 compared to 46 kboe/d in 2017 and 34 kboe/d in 2016.
TOTAL is present on six licenses. Five of them have fields in
production: San Alberto (15%), San Antonio (15%), Block XX Tarija
Oeste (41%), and Aquio and Ipati (50%, operator), where the
Incahuasi gas field started production in August 2016.

Exploration & Production segment

On the Aquio and Ipati Blocks of the Incahuasi field, the decision
was taken to connect the ICS-3 well in 2017, and the increase of the
plant's capacity to 390 Mcf/d was approved in June 2018.

An exploration well is expected to be drilled on the Azero exploration
license (60%) in 2019.

In Venezuela, the Group’s production was 34 kboe/d in 2018
compared to 44 kboe/d in 2017 and 47 kboe/d in 2016. It comes
from the Group's interests in PetroCedefio (30.32%) and Yucal Placer
(69.5%). The development of the extra heavy oil field of PetroCedenho
continues (26 wells were drilled in 2018, compared to 49 in 2017
and 39 in 2016), as well as the debottlenecking project for the water
separation and treatment facilities. For information on international
economic sanctions concerning Venezuela, refer to point 3.1.9 of
chapter 3.

In Brazil, the Group's production totaled 19 kboe/d in 2018, which
was the Group's first full year of production in the country.
The production comes from the Libra (20%) field, where the part in
production was renamed Mero in 2017, and the Lapa (35%, operator)
and lara (22.5%) fields. The Mero field is located in the Santos Basin
in very deep waters (2,000 m), approximately 170 km off the coast of
Rio de Janeiro. At year-end 2018, 15 wells had been drilled and the
production started in 2017 with the FPSO Pioneiro de Libra (50 kb/d
capacity) designed to carry out the long-term production tests
necessary for optimizing future development phases. The first
development phase (17 wells connected to an FPSO with a capacity
of 150 kb/d) also started in 2017.

In 2017, TOTAL and Petrobras signed definitive contracts in relation
to a package of assets in Brazil contemplated by their strategic
alliance agreed in 2016. As part of this strategic alliance, in January
2018, TOTAL acquired a 22.5% interest in the concession lara,
located in Block BM-S-11A, which is currently under development,
as well as a 35% interest and the operatorship in the Lapa field
concession area, located in Block BM-S-9A, which started up in
2016. TOTAL holds a 35% interest in Lapa field. TOTAL is expected
to increase to 45% following the finalization of the acquisition of an
additional interest of 10%, which is subject to approval by the relevant
Brazilian authorities. The agreements provide for the strengthening
of technical cooperation between the two companies, in particular
by the joint assessment of the exploration potential of promising
areas in Brazil and by the development of new technologies, in
particular in deep offshore. On lara, the declaration of the
commerciality of two developments has been made, one for the
development of the two Berbigao and Sururu-West fields, and the
other for the development of the Atapu field. On the Sururu field, a
six-month production test has been completed and the drilling of an
appraisal well has revealed the highest oil column in the pre-salt in
Brazil (630 m).

The acquisition of Maersk Oil in March 2018 allowed for the
incorporation of new assets in TOTAL's portfolio in Brazil: Wahoo
(28.6%) and Itaipu (40%) respectively on the BMC-30 and
BMC-32 Blocks in the Campos Basin.

In addition, the Group holds 17 exploration licenses located in the
Barreirinhas, Ceara, Espirito Santo, Foz do Amazonas and Pelotas
basins.

In Colombia, TOTAL started production on the Niscota field (71.4%)
in 2017. The commerciality of the development of the field was
declared In November 2018. The Group's production totaled
1 kboe/d in 2018.

In Mexico, TOTAL was awarded exploration licenses in 2016 on
three blocks in offshore Mexico, following the country’s first
competitive deep water bid round. Located in the Perdido Basin,
Block 2 (50%, operator) covers an area of 2,977 km? at depths of
between 2,300 and 3,600 meters. TOTAL also holds stakes in Blocks
1 (33.33%) and 3 (33.33%), located in the Salina Basin, and in Block
15 (60%, operator). In March 2018, TOTAL obtained three exploration
blocks in the shallow waters of the Campeche Basin: Block 32 (60%),
Block 33 (50%, operator) and Block 34 (42.5%).

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

In Guyana, TOTAL finalized in 2018 the acquisition of a 35% stake in
the Canje Block, 25% of the Kanuku Block and 25% of the Orinduik
Block, as part of the exploration of the prolific offshore Guyana Basin.
The acquisition of these interests has been approved by the authorities.

Rest of the Americas zone

At the end of 2018, TOTAL disposed of its interests in the Aruba
exploration license. The Group holds an interest in the Guyane Maritime
license in French Guiana (100%, operator), on which plug and
abandonmet operations of the negative exploration well GMES-6 are
in progress.

2.1.9.5 Asia-Pacific

In 2018, TOTAL’s production in the zone of Asia-Pacific was
141 kboe/d, representing 5% of the Group’s overall production,
compared to 244 kboe/d in 2017 and 265 kboe/d in 2016. The
two main producing countries in this zone in 2018 were Thailand
and Australia.

In Thailand, the Group's production was 52 kboe/d in 2018
compared to 58 kboe/d in 2017 and 60 kboe/d in 2016.
This production comes from the Bongkot offshore gas and
condensate field (33.33%). The Thai state-owned company PTT
purchases all of the natural gas and condensate production. New
platforms were installed in 2018 to maintain the production plateau.

In Australia, the Group's production was 34 kboe/d in 2018
compared to 19 kboe/d in 2017 and 16 kboe/d in 2016. It comes
from Gladstone LNG (GLNG) (27.5%) and Ichthys LNG, project for
which the start of the offshore production began in July 2018 and
the first export of LNG occured in October 2018. The Ichthys LNG
project involves the development of a gas and condensate field
located in the Browse Basin. This development includes a platform
for the production, processing and export of gas, an FPSO for
processing and exporting the condensate, an 889 km gas pipeline
and an onshore liquefaction plant in Darwin. When running at full
capacity, the two trains of the gas liquefaction plant will supply
8.9 Mt/y of LNG, 100,000 barrels of condensates per day and
1.65 Mt/y of LPG. The LNG has already been sold, mainly on the
Asian market, under long-term contracts. TOTAL disposed in
December 2018 of a 4% interest in the Ichthys LNG project in
Australia, thus reducing TOTAL's interest in the asset from 30% to
26%.

GLNG is an integrated production, transportation and liquefaction
project from the Fairview, Roma, Scotia and Arcadia fields with a
capacity of 7.8 Mt/y located on Curtis Island, Queensland. The plant's
two trains are in production.

In Brunei, the Group’s production was 19 kboe/d in 2018 compared
to 21 kboe/d in 2017 and 18 kboe/d in 2016. It comes from the
Maharaja Lela Jamalulalam condensate gas field on Block B (37.5%,
operator) and from the unitized Gumusut-Kakap field, of which the
part in Brunei is located on Block CA1 (86.9%, operator). The signing
of the unitization agreements in July 2018 gives TOTAL access to
4.64% of the Gumusut-Kakap field, which started in 2012 and
produced 155 kboe/d of oil in 2018. The gas from the Maharaja Lela
Jamalulalam field is delivered to the Brunei LNG liquefaction plant.

On the CA1 deep offshore exploration Block (86.9%, operator), the
exploration license was extended for two years in October 2018.

In Myanmar, the Group's production was 17 kboe/d in 2018
compared to 19 kboe/d in 2017 and 21 kboe/d in 2016.

The Yadana field (31.24%, operator), located on the offshore Blocks
M5 and M6, primarily produces gas for delivery to PTT for use in Thai
power plants. The Yadana field also supplies the domestic market
via an offshore pipeline built and operated by MOGE, a Myanmar
state-owned company. In 2017, TOTAL started production on the
Badamyar field, a satellite of the Yadana field. This project is expected
to make it possible to extend production on this gas field, which is
8 Bef/y, beyond 2020.


--- Page 44 ---

In 2015, the Group entered exploration license A6 (40%) located in
the deep offshore area west of Myanmar, where a gas discovery has
been made. A delineation well drilled in 2018 has produced
encouraging results. These discoveries are currently being assessed.

In 2015, TOTAL signed a production sharing contract on the deep
offshore YWB Block (100%, operator). The 2016 2D seismic survey
was followed by a 3D seismic survey in 2018.

In China, the Group’s production was 16 kboe/d in 2018 compared
to 15 kboe/d in 2017 and 10 kboe/d in 2016. This production comes.
from the South Sulige Block (49%) in the Ordos Basin of Inner
Mongolia, where the drilling of tight gas development wells is ongoing.

In 2017, TOTAL signed a production sharing contract on the Taiyang
exploration Block (49%, operator), located in both Chinese and
Taiwanese waters in the China Sea. A 2D seismic survey was carried
out in 2018.

In Indonesia, Group production was 3 kboe/d in 2018, compared
with 112 kboe/d in 2017 and 140 kboe/d in 2016, given the expiry of
the Mahakam license and the transfer of the corresponding activities
to Pertamina (operator) on January 1, 2018. The Group still holds an
interest in the Sebuku license (15%), production from the Ruby gas
field is routed by pipeline for processing and separation at the Senipah
terminal.

In Papua New Guinea, the Group owns a stake in Block PRL-15
(40.1%, operator since 2015). The State of Papua New Guinea retains
the right to take a stake in the license (when the final investment

BUSINESS OVERVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018

Exploration & Production segment

decision is made) at a level of 22.5%. In this case, TOTAL’s stake
would be reduced to 31.1%. Block PRL-15 includes the two
discoveries Elk and Antelope. The delineation program of these
discoveries was completed in 2017 and the results of the wells drilled
confirmed the resource levels of the fields. Development studies
continued in 2018.

TOTAL holds interests in the PPL339 (35%), PPL589 (100%) and
PPL576 (100%) exploration licenses. The interpretation of the
multi-client seismic survey performed in late 2016 on PPL576
revealed some promising prospects.

TOTAL and its partners signed on November 2018 a Memorandum
of Understanding with the Independent State of Papua New Guinea
defining the key terms of the Gas Agreement for the Papua LNG
Project. The proposed Gas agreement is expected to be finalized in
the first half of 2019.

Rest of the Asia-Pacific zone

TOTAL also holds interests in exploration licenses in Malaysia and
the Philippines. In Cambodia, TOTAL is working to implement an
agreement entered into in 2009 with the Cambodian government for
the exploration of Block 3 located in an area of the Gulf of Thailand
disputed by the governments of Cambodia and Thailand. This
agreement remains subject to the establishment by both countries of
an appropriate contractual framework. In Sri Lanka, in 2016 TOTAL
signed an agreement to proceed with surveys on the offshore JS-5
and JS-6 Blocks off the east coast.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018

Gas, Renewables & Power segment

2.2 Gas, Renewables & Power segment

The Gas, Renewables & Power segment carries the Group's ambition in low carbon activities through the development of downstream gas

and low carbon electricity as well as the energy efficiency businesses.

The segment employs an integrated business model along the full gas and power value chain. The LNG business is growing in particular
following the acquisition of the LNG business of Engie in 2018. The number of customers grows as well strongly, notably in B2C, following the

acquisition of Direct Energie in 2018 and Lampiris in 2016.

(© Excluding financial charges.

Adjusted net operating income for the Gas, Renewables & Power
segment was $756 million in 2018, notably thanks to the good
performance of LNG and gas/power trading activities. The increase
in working capital related to the consolidation of the acquisitions of
Direct Energie and the LNG business of Engie was mainly responsible
for the negative cash flow from operations in 2018.

TOTAL integrates the climate change in its strategy and anticipates
the new trends on the energy market. Thus, the Group strengthens
its development in the natural gas value chain and intends to develop
profitable activities in low-carbon electricity.

The activities of TOTAL in the gas business contribute to the growth
of the Group by ensuring market outlets for its current and future
natural gas production. In addition to its activities in liquefied natural
gas (LNG) (refer to point 2.1.8 in this chapter), TOTAL is also present
in the trading of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

TOTAL is present along the entire electricity value chain, from the
production of low carbon electricity to marketing activities. TOTAL’s
activities in electricity production rely on its subsidiaries Direct Energie,
Quadran, Total Solar and its shareholdings in SunPower and Total
Eren. TOTAL is also involved in electricity storage (Saft Groupe),

as well as in services to reduce the energy consumption of its
customers and the environmental footprint, in particular through its
Greenflex subsidiary or through projects to capture, store or use CO.

As part of its strategy aiming to develop low carbon activities, several
major acquisitions were made in 2018. In July 2018, the finalization
of the acquisition of Engie’s LNG business enabled TOTAL to
consolidate its position as a leading actor in LNG. This acquisition
strengthens TOTAL's positions in the production of LNG, increases
the number of long-term purchase and sales agreements, and its
regasification capacities, in particular in Europe, and adds a fleet of
LNG tankers, thereby offering more flexibility to its portfolio.

TOTAL also signed an agreement with KKR-Energas for the
acquisition of two combined-cycle natural gas power plants in France.
In September 2018, TOTAL finalized the acquisition of Direct Energie
(France's top alternative energy supplier) and its subsidiary Quadran
(developer and owner of renewables assets), thereby speeding up its
strategy to integrate the gas-electricity chain in Europe. In December
2018, TOTAL and EPH also signed an agreement allowing TOTAL,
subject to authorisation by the competent authorities, to acquire in
2020 two gas power turbines in France.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018

Gas, Renewables & Power segment

2.2.1 LNG

A pioneer in the LNG industry, TOTAL is today one of the world’s
leading players" in the sector and has solid and diversified positions
both in the upstream and downstream of the LNG chain. LNG
development is a key element of the strategy of the Group, which is
strengthening its positions in most major production regions and
main markets.

2.2.1.1 LNG production

Through its interests in liquefaction plants in Angola, Australia, Egypt,
the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Qatar, Russia and
Yemen"!, the Group sells LNG across markets worldwide. In 2018,
the share of LNG production was 11.1 Mt, compared to 11.2 Mt in
2017 and 11 Mt in 2016. In 2018, the Ichthys (Australia) and Yamal
LNG (Russia) plants started producing LNG. The growth of LNG
production sold by TOTAL over the coming years is expected to be
ensured by the Group's liquefaction projects under construction
(in the United States and Russia), or by projects currently under study
(Papua New Guinea, Nigeria, Russia, Oman, Mexico and the United
States).

Thereby, in March 2019, Total has signed the definitive agreement
with PAO Novatek" for the acquisition of a direct 10% interest in
Arctic LNG 2. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
signed with the government of Oman is expected to enable the
Group to develop a regional hub for the delivery of an LNG bunker
service to ships, using the natural gas resources from Block 6. Finally,
TOTAL has signed an MOU with Sempra Energy for the development
of projects for the export of North American LNG, including the
expansion of Cameron LNG in Louisiana and the Energia Costa Azul
project in Baja California, Mexico.

2.2.1.2 Long-term Group LNG sales and purchases

TOTAL acquires long-term LNG volumes mainly from liquefaction
projects in which the Group holds an interest (Egyptian LNG in Egypt,
Ichthys in Australia, Qatargas 2 in Qatar, Nigeria LNG in Nigeria,
Snohvit in Norway, Yamal LNG in Russia and Yemen LNG in Yemen).
Furthermore, TOTAL also acquired long-term LNG volumes from
American projects in which the Group has no equity (Sabine Pass,
Corpus Christi, Cove Point). These volumes support the expansion
of the Group's worldwide LNG portfolio. Since 2009, a growing
portion of the long- term volume purchased by the Group that was
initially intended for delivery to North American and European markets
has been diverted to Asian markets, benefitting from a better price
environment.

New LNG sources arising from, among others, the acquisition of
Engie's LNG assets in the United States (Cameron LNG) are expected
to ensure the growth of the Group’s LNG portfolio. The Group is
developing new LNG markets by launching projects of Floating
Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU) for the import of LNG, for
example in Myanmar or Céte d'Ivoire, in addition to the two FSRUs
already in operation following the acquisition of Engie’s LNG activities.

TOTAL holds several significant contracts for the long-term sale of
LNG in Chile, China, South Korea, Spain, the United States,
Indonesia, Japan, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Singapore and
Taiwan.

2.2.1.3. LNG shipping

As part of its LNG shipping activities, TOTAL uses a fleet of 15 LNG
vessels, 12 of which come from the acquisition of Engie’s LNG
portfolio. In addition to the fleet, TOTAL may also charter extra vessels
on a spot and short-term basis to meet trading needs.

Publicly available information: upstream and downstream LNG portfolios in 2018.

2.2.1.4 LNG trading

The Group's activities are developing in LNG trading through major
sale and purchase contracts and are reinforced by the acquisition
of Engie’s portfolio of LNG activities. In 2018, these LNG trading
activities represented a volume of 17.1 Mt compared with 7.6 Mt in
2017 and 5.1 Mt in 2016.

The portfolio focuses, in particular, on Asian markets (China, South
Korea, India, Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan) and is made up of spot
and long-term contracts that enable TOTAL to supply gas to its main
customers worldwide, while keeping sufficient flexibility to seize
market opportunities.

In 2018, the trading teams were located in London, Paris, Houston
and Singapore.

In 2018, TOTAL bought 173 shipments under long-term contracts
from Algeria, Australia, Egypt, the United States, Nigeria, Norway,
Qatar and Russia and 97 spot or medium-term shipments, compared
with 59 and 49 in 2017, and 51 and 19 in 2016 respectively. Deliveries
from Yemen LNG have been halted since 2015.

2.2.1.5 LNG regasification

TOTAL has entered agreements that provide a long-term access to
LNG regasification capacity worldwide, through existing assets or
projects under development in Europe (Belgium, France and the
United Kingdom), the Americas (the United States, Panama and
Mexico), Asia (India and Myanmar) and Africa (Céte d'lvoire). TOTAL
also charters two FSRUs.

In 2018, TOTAL has an LNG regasification capacity in the range of
27 Bem/y, of which 20 Bcm/y comes from the acquisition of Engie’s
LNG activities.

In France, TOTAL holds a 27.5% interest in Fosmax LNG.
The terminal received 65 vessels in 2018, compared with 55 in 2017
and 54 in 2016.

In October 2018, TOTAL sold its 9.99% stake in the Dunkerque LNG
terminal, with a capacity of 13 Bom/y.

In the United Kingdom, through its equity interest in the Qatargas
2 project, TOTAL holds an 8.35% stake in the South Hook LNG
regasification terminal, with a total capacity of 21 Bem/y.

In the United States, in 2004, TOTAL has reserved a regasification
capacity of approximately 10 Bcm/y in the Sabine Pass terminal
(Louisiana) for a 20-year period until 2029. In 2012, TOTAL and
Sabine Pass Liquefaction (SPL) signed agreements allowing TOTAL's
reserved regasification capacity to gradually be transferred by TOTAL
to SPL in return for a payment.

In India, TOTAL disposed of its 26% stake in the Hazira terminal in
January 2019. The terminal received 67 vessels in 2018, compared
with 44 in 2017 and 61 in 2016. Furthermore, in October 2018,
TOTAL and Adani Group signed an agreement to develop several
LNG regasification terminals, including Dhamra LNG on the east
coast of India, and to develop the marketing of LNG in India.
Thus, TOTAL relies on a recognized local partner to break into the
Indian market.

In Myanmar, a consortium led by TOTAL has been tasked with the
responsibility of developing an integrated project, including an FSRU
LNG regasification terminal at Kanbauk, a 1,230 MW production
plant and the supply of electricity as far as Yangon, which is expected
to start up in 2023.

to start up in 2021.

2.2.2 Trading and transport (excluding LNG)

2.2.2.1 Trading excluding LNG

Following the sale in 2015 of its subsidiary Total Coal South Africa,
the Group ceased its coal production activities. Moreover, in 2016,
the Group stopped its coal sales and trading activities.

A) LPG

In 2018, TOTAL traded and sold nearly 5.2 Mt of LPG (propane and
butane) worldwide, compared to 4.9 Mt in 2017 and 5.3 Mt in 2016.
Nearly 30% of these quantities came from fields or refineries operated
by the Group. This trading activity was conducted by means of seven
long-term chartered vessels. In 2018, 255 journeys were necessary
for transporting the negotiated quantities, including 156 journeys
carried out by TOTAL's long-term chartered vessels and 99 journeys
by spot-chartered vessels.

B) Petcoke and sulfur

TOTAL sells petcoke coming from the Port Arthur refinery in the
United States and the Jubail refinery in Saudi Arabia. Petcoke is sold
to cement producers and electricity producers mainly in India, as
well as in Mexico, Brazil, other Latin American countries and Turkey.
2.2 Mt of petcoke were sold on the international market in 2018,
compared to 2.1 Mt in 2017 and 1.9 Mt in 2016.

2.2.3. Low carbon electricity production

In the second half of 2018, TOTAL accelerated its strategy to integrate
the gas-electricity chain in Europe and to develop low-carbon
electricity by acquiring Direct Energie and two combined-cycle natural
gas power plants in France from KKR-Energas. Consequently,
TOTAL has the capacity to produce 2.7 GW of low-carbon electricity
from gas and renewables (in Group share) worldwide.

2.2.3.1 Electricity production from natural gas

The construction of a portfolio of combined-cycle gas power plants
in Europe is part of the strategy to integrate the gas and electricity
value chain, from production to marketing, and compliments well the
sources of production of intermittent renewable electricity.
Furthermore, the flexible production of these power plants enables
the Group to optimize its customers’ electricity supply costs.

In France and Belgium, TOTAL owns four combined-cycle natural
gas (CCGT) power plants. The global installed capacity is 1.6 GW.
TOTAL holds a 60% stake in project to build a fifth 0.4 GW CCGT
power plant in Landivisiau, France. The agreement signed in
December 2018 with EPH will bring to TOTAL portfolio two additional
gas power turbines (0.8 GW) from 2020, subject to authorisation by
the competent authorities.

In Abu Dhabi, the Taweelah A1 gas power plant, which is owned by
the Gulf Total Tractebel Power Company (TOTAL, 20%), combines
electricity generation and water desalination. The plant has a net
power generation capacity of 1.6 GW and a water desalination
capacity of 385,000 m® per day. The plant’s production is sold to
Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Company (ADWEC) as part of a
long-term agreement.

TOTAL also sells sulfur, mainly from the production of its refineries.
In 2018, 1.4 Mt was sold, compared with 0.9 Mt in 2017 and 0.7 Mt
in 2016.

C) Natural gas and electricity

TOTAL is pursuing gas and electricity trading operations in Europe
and North America in order to sell the Group's production and to
supply the marketing subsidiaries and other entities of the Group.

In Europe, TOTAL sold 46.4 Bcm of natural gas in 2018, compared
with 33.3 Bem in 2017 and 32.9 Bem in 2016". The Group also
traded 65.4 TWh of electricity in 2018, compared to 70.2 TWh in
2017 and 49.1 TWh in 2016, mainly from external sources.

In North America, TOTAL sold 13.7 Bom of natural gas in 2018
from its own production or from external resources, compared to
12.1 Bem in 2017 and 10.1 Bem in 2016.

2.2.2.2 Transport of natural gas

The Group holds interests in gas pipelines (refer to point 2.1.14 of
this chapter) located in Brazil and Argentina.

In Brazil, TOTAL and Petrobras pursue the study of new business
opportunities in the natural gas.

2.2.3.2 Electricity production from renewables

As part of its development in low-carbon electricity, TOTAL relies on
its Quadran and Total Solar subsidiaries and its shareholdings in
SunPower and Total Eren.

A) SunPower

TOTAL has held, since 2011, a majority interest in SunPower (65.66%
as of December 31, 2018), an American company listed on NASDAQ
and based in California.

Since 2017, SunPower has focused its activities on two segments:
on the one hand, the design, production and international sale of
very high-efficiency solar cells and panels, and, on the other hand,
the sale of photovoltaic systems, that increasingly include storage, in
the United States. SunPower had a capacity to produce
Inter-digitated Back Contact (IBC) cells of almost 1.2 GW/y at the
end of 2018. The cells are then assembled into solar panels in plants
located mainly in France and Mexico. To enlarge its commercial
offering, SunPower has marketed, since 2016, a new range of panels
to target the most competitive market sectors while continuing to
hold a technological edge over its competitors. SunPower is finalizing
the development of its future highly efficient technology, which
significantly reduces costs, and has launched its industrial
deployment.

SunPower markets its panels worldwide for applications ranging from
residential and commercial roof tiles to solar power plants.

solar power, storage and other services).

As part of its recentering strategy, SunPower sold, in June 2018, its
stake in 8point3 Energy Partners to an investment fund in the energy
sector. In 2018, SunPower also sold its inverters activity and its last
solar farm projects that were under development, mainly in the
Americas.

In October 2018, SunPower acquired certain assets of SolarWorld
Americas, in particular the Hillsboro plant in Oregon, thereby
strengthening its position in the production of solar panels in the
United States. In September 2018, the American government
exempted the IBC technology of the customs tariffs imposed by the
American authorities on imports of cells and panels in January 2018.

B) Quadran

In 2018, TOTAL maintained its policy of investing in low-carbon
businesses with the acquisition of Direct Energie, which owns
Quadran. This company enables the Group to speed up its
development in solar and wind power, biogas and in hydroelectricity
in France.

This acquisition adds 0.7 GW gross installed capacity (in 100%).
At the end of 2018, Quadran operates a portfolio of 213 onshore

wind, solar, hydroelectric and biogas assets in France, and develops
a series of renewable electricity projects that have reached different
stages of maturity.

C) Total Eren

In December 2017, TOTAL acquired a 23% interest in Eren
Renewable Energy, which has since been renamed Total Eren.
TOTAL will be able to take control of Total Eren after a period of five
years. Through its partnerships with local developers, Total Eren
today manages numerous energy projects in countries and regions
where renewable energies represent an economically viable response
to a growing demand for energy, such as Asia-Pacific, Africa and
Latin America.

Total Eren has a diversified set of assets in renewable energies
(wind, solar and hydraulic), representing a gross installed capacity of
about 1.3 GW (in 100%) in operation or under construction around
the world.

intermittent by nature. This is one of Saft's main sources of growth.

2.2.6 Innovation and energy efficiency

2.2.6.1 Energy efficiency services

The energy efficiency services market is experiencing strong growth,
which is expected to accelerate in the coming years. In this context,
the Group is investing in this market, with the aim of helping
customers optimize their consumption and emissions, in particular
by choosing between the best energy sources.

In 2017, the Group finalized the acquisition of GreenFlex, a French
company founded in 2009 with over 700 customers. GreenFlex
employs around 400 people and recorded sales of €410 million at
year-end 2018, compared to €359 million at year-end 2017.

This acquisition is fully aligned with the Group's strategy for growth
in the energy performance sector, in priority in major European
countries.

2.2.6.2 Total Energy Ventures

Total Energy Ventures (TEV) invests in the initial development phases
of companies that offer technologies or economic models of strategic
interest to TOTAL. These areas of interest include renewable energies,
digital energy, energy storage and mobility services. Whereas
historically TEV invested predominantly in Europe and the United
States, the company started investing in 2018 in China. In particular,
TEV signed an agreement with NIO Capital to cooperate and invest
in the mobility segment.

TEV also launched its investment platform dedicated to emerging
markets, and in particular to companies developing business models
for access to energy for people who are not connected to the grid.
Initially, this activity will be focused on Africa.

2.2.6.3. Carbon capture, use and storage

In order to promote a new industry in the field of carbon capture,
utilization and storage (CCUS), the Group is examining the possibility
of developing new businesses to enable its industrial, domestic or
electricity producing customers to capture, store, utilize or neutralize
their CO, emissions.

TOTAL considers CCUS to be one of the key drivers to tackle the
challenge of the climate change and is particularly interested in the
development of new business and industrial models associated with
this value chain.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018

Gas, Renewables & Power segment

As part of a European alliance, Saft and its partners launched, in
2018, an R&D program that aims to develop the future generations
of lithium-ion batteries (Gen 3A and Gen 3B), and then the solid
electrolyte lithium battery technology. As of year-end 2018, Saft is
present in 18 countries worldwide (historically in Europe and the
United States) and has over 4,300 employees. Saft is achieving
growth in emerging countries, in particular in Asia, South America
and Russia, and has 14 production sites and approximately 30 sales
offices. In 2018, Saft’s turnover amounted to $788 million.

In this area, the Group intends to participate directly or indirectly (via
the OGCI fund in particular) in large-scale pilot projects. TOTAL thus.
launched, in 2017, studies with Equinor and Royal Dutch Shell for
developing the transport and storage aspects of the first industrial
commercial project in the world for the capture, transport and storage
of CO;, with a capacity of 1.5 Mt of CO./y. The project aims to store
the emissions from two industrial sites near Oslo, Norway, and will
also be able to collect emissions from other emitters. TOTAL also
supports the feasibility studies conducted by the OGCI fund, with
5 other partners, on a project located in Teesside (United Kingdom).
This project combines gas based power generation with capture of
the related CO,, the collection of the CO, emissions from neighboring
industries, its offshore storage and its possible recovery in other uses.

2.2.6.4 Access to energy

First launched in 2011 in four pilot countries, TOTAL's solar solutions
for access to energy were distributed in 40 countries by 2018.
By the end of 2018, 2.7 million lamps and solar kits had been sold,
improving the day-to-day lives of nearly 12 million people.
The distribution channels used are both TOTAL traditional networks
(service stations) and “last mile” networks built with local partners to
bring these solutions to isolated areas. Reseller networks are set up
and economic programs developed with the support of external
partners to recruit and train young solar resellers.

In addition, in 2018, around 10 incubation projects were launched
with start-ups in the nano-grid, mini-grid, recycling and Wi-Fi terminals
segments. More than 20 business partnerships were also deployed
in the field, with organizations ranging from NGOs and development
agencies, to professional customers (distributors, major TOTAL
accounts, etc.) and international organizations.

2.3.1 Refining & Chemicals

Refining & Chemicals includes refining, base petrochemicals (olefins
and aromatics), polymer derivatives (polyethylene, polypropylene,
polystyrene and hydrocarbon resins), biomass conversion and
elastomer processing (Hutchinson). The electroplating chemistry
(Atotech) and adhesives (Bostik) activities were sold in 2017 and
2015, respectively. The volume of its Refining & Chemicals activities
places TOTAL among the top 10 integrated producers worldwide’).

The strategy of Refining & Chemicals integrates a constant
requirement for safety, a core value of the Group, and the priority
given to the management of its environmental footprint. In a context
of rising worldwide demand for oil and petrochemicals driven by
non-OECD countries and the entry of new capacities into the market,
the strategy involves:

— improving competitiveness of refining and petrochemicals
activities by making optimal use of industrial means of production
and concentrating investments on large integrated platforms;

— developing petrochemicals in the United States and the Middle
East by exploiting the proximity of cost-effective oil and gas
resources in order to supply growing markets, in particular Asia;
and

— innovating in low carbon activities by developing biofuels,
biopolymers and plastics recycling solutions as well as materials
contributing to the energy efficiency of the Group's customers, in
particular in the automotive market.

2.3.1.1 Refining and petrochemicals

TOTAL's refining capacity was 2,021 kb/d as of December 31, 2018,
same as at year-end 2017 and compared to 2,011 kb/d at year-end
2016. The Refining & Chemicals segment managed a capacity of
1,993 kb/d at year-end 2018, or 99% of the Group's total capacity.

TOTAL has equity stakes in 18 refineries (including nine operated by
companies of the Group), located in Europe, the Middle East, the
United States, Asia and Africa®.

The petrochemicals businesses are located mainly in Europe, the
United States, Qatar, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Most of these
sites are either adjacent to or connected by pipelines to Group
refineries. As a result, TOTAL's petrochemical operations are
integrated within its refining operations, thereby maximizing synergies.

Between 2011 and 2016, the Group reduced its production
capacities in Europe by 20%, thereby fully meeting the target it had
set for 2017. Since then, the major investment project launched in
2013 on the Antwerp platform in Belgium has been completed, with
the aim of improving the site's conversion rate and increasing the
flexibility of the steam crackers. The project to transform the La Méde
refinery into a biorefinery continues.

A) Activities by geographical area
a) Europe

TOTAL is the second largest refiner and petrochemist in Western
Europe®.

Western Europe accounts for 71% of the Group’s refining capacity,
i.e., 1,437 kb/d at year-end 2018, compared with 1,454 kb/d at
year-end 2017 and year-end 2016.

The Group operates eight refineries in Western Europe (one in
Antwerp, Belgium, five in France in Donges, Feyzin, Gonfreville,
Grandpuits and La Méde, one in Immingham, United Kingdom, and
one in Leuna, Germany) and owns a 55% stake in the Vlissingen
refinery (Zeeland) in the Netherlands. In the first quarter of 2018, the

BUSINESS OVERVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018

Refining & Chemicals segment

Group sold its stake in TotalErg, which held a stake in the Trecate
refinery in Italy.

The Group's main petrochemical sites in Europe are located in
Belgium, in Antwerp (steam crackers, aromatics, polyethylene) and
Feluy (polyolefins, polystyrene), and in France, in Carling (polyethylene,
polystyrene, polypropylene compounds), Feyzin (steam cracker,
aromatics), Gonfreville (steam crackers, aromatics, styrene,
polyolefins, polystyrene) and Lavéra (steam cracker, aromatics,
polypropylene). Europe accounts for 48% of the Group’s
petrochemicals capacity, ie., 10,277 kt at year-end 2018, compared
to 10,293 kt at year-end 2017 and 10,383 kt at year-end 2016.

— In France, the Group continues to improve its operational
efficiency in a context of stagnation in the consumption of
petroleum products in Europe.

In 2018, TOTAL continued the significant modernization plan
announced in 2015 for its refining facilities in France, in particular
at La Méde, with an investment decision made in 2015 for around
€275 million to transform the site and in particular create the first
biorefinery in France. The first step of this investment took place
at the end of 2016 when the processing of crude oil ended.
The industrial transformation of La Méde will contribute to
respond to the growing demand for biofuels in Europe as from
the first half of 2019. Other activities, such as a logistics and
storage platform, a solar energy farm and a training center were
developed on the site since 2017, in addition to an AdBlue“
production plant, which started up in August 2018.

In Donges, the €400 million investment project for the
construction of intermediate feedstock desulfurization units and
hydrogen production units is under study. This program requires
the re-routing of the railroad track that currently crosses the
refinery. A three-party memorandum of intent to fund this
re-routing work between the French State, local authorities and
TOTAL was signed at the end of 2015.

In petrochemicals, the Group reconfigured the Carling platform
in Lorraine. Since the shutdown of the steam cracking activity in
2015, new hydrocarbon resins and compound polypropylene
production units have been in activity.

— In Germany, TOTAL operates the Leuna refinery (100%), where
anew benzene extraction unit (approximately 60 kt/y) started up
late 2017. In 2015, the Group completed the sale of its stake in
the Schwedt refinery (16.7%) and acquired a majority stake in
Polyblend, a manufacturer of polyolefin compounds that are
mainly used in the automotive industry.

— In Belgium, the Group finalized a major project in 2017 to
modernize its Antwerp platform, with:

- new conversion units in response to the shift in demand
towards lighter petroleum products with a very low sulfur
content, and

— anew unit to convert part of the combustible gases recovered
from the refining process into raw materials for the
petrochemical units.

In addition, the Group has developed a project to enable greater
flexibility on one of the steam-cracking units and has thus been
processing ethane since 2017.

— In the United Kingdom, TOTAL decreased the capacity of the
Lindsey refinery by half in 2016, reducing it to 5.5 Mt/y.
The investment plan also focuses on improving the conversion
ratio, adapting logistics and simplifying the refinery's organization,
thereby lowering the site’s break-even point.

b) North America

The Group's main sites in North America are located in Texas, at Port
Arthur (refinery, steam cracker), Bayport (polyethylene), La Porte
(polypropylene) and in Louisiana, at Carville (styrene, polystyrene).

At Port Arthur, TOTAL holds at the same site a 100% interest in a
178 kb/d capacity refinery and a 40% stake in BASF Total
Petrochemicals (BTP), which has a condensate splitter and a steam
cracker. The Group continues to work on strengthening the synergies
between these two plants. The BTP cracker can produce more than
1 Mt/y of ethylene, of which more than 85% on ethane, propane and
butane, which are produced in abundance locally.

At La Porte, TOTAL operates a large polypropylene plant, with a
capacity of 1.2 Mt/y.

At Carville, TOTAL operates a styrene plant with a capacity of
1.2 Mt/y, in a 50% joint-venture with SABIC and a polystyrene unit
with a capacity of 700 kt/y, which is 100% owned.

Finally, in partnership with Borealis and Nova Chemicals, TOTAL
started construction in 2017 of a new ethane cracker with an ethylene
production capacity of 1 Mt/y on the Port Arthur site for an investment
of $1.7 billion. The partners in the joint-venture (TOTAL, 50%) decided
in September 2018 to develop a new polyethylene unit downstream
of the cracker, in addition to the capacities of the Bayport site which
TOTAL contributed to the joint-venture. This integrated development
is expected to more than double the site’s polyethylene capacity to
1.1 Mt/y and to thus maximize synergies with the existing assets at
Port Arthur and Bayport.

c) Asia, the Middle East and Africa

TOTAL is continuing to expand in growth areas and is developing
sites in countries with favorable access to raw materials. The Group.
has first-rate platforms in these markets, which are ideally positioned
for growth.

In Saudi Arabia, TOTAL has a 37.5% stake in SATORP (Saudi
Aramco Total Refining and Petrochemical Company), which operates.
the Jubail refinery. It has been fully operational since mid-2014.
This refinery, situated close to Saudi Arabia's heavy crude oil fields,
increased its capacity by 10% to 440 kb/d following the
debottlenecking in early 2018 during its first major shutdown.
The refinery’s configuration enables it to process these heavy crudes
and sell fuels and other light products that meet very strict
specifications and are mainly intended for export. The refinery is also
integrated with petrochemical units: an 800 kt/y paraxylene unit, a
200 kt/y propylene unit, and a 140 kt/y benzene unit. In addition,
TOTAL and Saudi Aramco signed in October 2018 an agreement to
jointly develop the engineering studies for the construction of a
petrochemicals complex adjacent to the refinery. This gigantic project
will include a mixed-load steam cracker (50% ethane and refinery
gas) with a capacity of 1.5 Mt/y and polyethylene units.

(1) TOTAL shareholdings: Qapco (20%); Qatofin (49%); RLOC (22.5%).

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

In China, TOTAL holds a 22.4% stake in WEPEC, a company that
operates a refinery located in Dalian. The sale of this stake to one of
the Chinese partners of the joint-venture is in the process of being
finalized. During the first quarter of 2019, the Group sold its
polystyrene activity in China, which notably included two plants in
Foshan (Guangdong province) and Ningbo (Zheijiang province) in the
Shanghai region, each with a capacity of 200 kt/y.

In South Korea, TOTAL has a 50% stake in Hanwha Total
Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. (HTC), which operates a petrochemical
complex in Daesan (condensate splitter, steam cracker, styrene,
paraxylene, polyolefins). Following the launch in 2014 of new
aromatics (paraxylene and benzene) and polymer units (EVA2), HTC
continued to expand its activities and the steam cracker now has an
ethylene production capacity of 1.1 Mt/y and a styrene production
capacity of 1.1 Mt/y. The EVA2 and ARO2 units were debottlenecked
in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In addition, investments totaling
$750 million were decided in 2017 to increase the ethylene
production capacity by 30% and the polyethylene production capacity
by more than 50%. At the end of 2018, the decision was taken to
make an additional investment of $500 million to increase the
polypropylene production capacity by nearly 60% by 2020 to reach
1.1 Mt/y, and to increase its ethylene production capacity by 10% to
reach 1.5 Mt/y.

In Qatar, the Group holds interests" in two ethane-based steam
crackers (Qapco, Ras Laffan Olefin Cracker-RLOC) and four
polyethylene lines operated by Qapco in Messaied, including the
Qatofin linear low-density polyethylene plant with a capacity of
550 kt/y and a Qapco 300 kt/y low-density polyethylene line which
started up in 2012.

TOTAL holds a 10% stake in the Ras Laffan condensate refinery, the
capacity of which increased to 300 kb/d following completion of the
project to double the refinery’s capacity; the new facilities were
commissioned in late 2016.

In the United Arab Emirates, in November 2018, TOTAL sold a
33.3% stake that it held in ADNOC Fertilizers, which operates a plant
producing 2 Mt/y of urea in Ruwais.

In Algeria, in October 2018, the Group signed a shareholders’
agreement with Sonatrach to create the joint-venture (Sonatrach 51%
and TOTAL 49%) to implement a joint petrochemicals project in
Arzew, in western Algeria. This project includes the construction of a
propane dehydrogenation plant and a polypropylene production unit
with a capacity of 550 kt/y. The joint-venture was incorporated in
January 2019.

In Africa, the Group also holds interests in four refineries (South
Africa, Cameroon, Céte d'Ivoire, Senegal) after the sale of its interest
in the refinery in Gabon in 2016. Refining & Chemicals provides
technical assistance for two of these refineries: the Natref refinery
with a capacity of 109 kb/d in South Africa and the SIR refinery with
a capacity of 80 kb/d in Céte d'Ivoire.

F) Developing new avenues for the production of fuels
and polymers

TOTAL is exploring new ways to monetize carbon resources,
conventional or otherwise (natural gas, biomass, waste). These
projects are part of the Group's commitment to building a diversified
energy mix generating lower CO, emissions.

Regarding biomass development, TOTAL is pursuing several industrial
and exploratory projects. The scope of these developments is broad
since they entail defining access to the resource (nature, sustainability,
location, supply method, transport), the nature of the molecules and
target markets (fuels, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals) and the
most appropriate, efficient and environmentally friendly conversion
processes.

a) Biomass to fuels

In Europe, TOTAL produces biofuels, notably hydrotreated vegetable
oils (HVO) for incorporation into diesel, and ether produced from
ethanol and isobutene (ETBE) for incorporation into gasoline.

As part of the La Méde refinery transformation program announced
in 2015, the Group will build the first biorefinery in France. Operations
are expected to restart in the first half of 2019 with a view to reaching
a production capacity of almost 500 kt/y of biofuel, mainly high-quality
biodiesel (HVO), but also biojet and petrochemical bio-feedstocks.

TOTAL continued extensive research activity in 2018, which targeted
the emergence of new biofuel solutions. The BioTFuel consortium’s
construction of a pilot demonstration unit on the Dunkerque (France)
site led to the commencement in 2017 of a gasification test program
for synthesis of biomass into fungible, sulfur-free fuels.

b) Biomass to polymers

TOTAL is actively involved in developing activities associated with
the conversion of biomass to polymers. The main area of focus is
developing drop-in solutions for direct substitutions, by incorporating
biomass into the Group's existing units, for example HVO or other
hydrotreated vegetable oil co-products in a naphtha cracker, and
developing the production of new molecules such as polylactic acid
polymer (PLA) from sugar. In 2017, the Group thus set up a
joint-venture with Corbion for the production and marketing of PLA
from a site in Thailand containing existing lactide units and PLA units,
which started production in December 2018 and have a production
capacity of 75 kt/y.

(1) 13.00% on December 31, 2018.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

c) Biotechnologies and the conversion of biomass

TOTAL is exploring a number of opportunities for developing biomass
and has launched numerous collaborative R&D projects for the
development of bio-sourced molecules with various academic
partners (the Joint BioEnergy Institute, United States, the University
of Wageningen, Netherlands and the Toulouse White Biotechnology
consortium, France) or through its Novogy subsidiary (Massachusetts,
United States). In addition, TOTAL holds an interest in Amyris Inc."),
an American company listed on NASDAQ.

On its R&D platform in Solaize (France), TOTAL develops new
biocomponents derived from the transformation of the biomass by
using a methodology based on predictive modeling and chemical
transformation into high added-value biomolecules.

In the longer term, the Group is also studying the potential for
developing a cost-effective phototrophic process for producing
biofuels through bioengineering of microalgae and microalgae
cultivation methods. It has several European partners in this field
(CEA, Wageningen).

d) Plastics recycling and circular economy

TOTAL is commited to developing recycling and end of life solutions
for plastics.

In France, TOTAL, Saint-Gobain, Citeo and Syndifrais founded a
partnership to develop an industrial polystyrene recycling value chain
by 2020 which aims to incorporate the polystyrene gathered and
sorted in the Group's plastics production units in Carling and Feluy.

In February 2019, TOTAL acquired French company Synova, a leader
in manufacturing high-performance recycled polypropylene for the
automotive sector, and which current production capacity in 20 kt/y
of polypropylene produced from recycled plastic material gathered
from wastes and industrial scraps.

TOTAL is also a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic
Waste, created in January 2019 to eliminate plastic waste in the
environment, especially in the oceans. Created in January 2019, this
international alliance has received commitments of over $1 billion
from the nearly 30 members to date to develop and bring to scale
solutions that will minimize and manage plastic waste and promote
solutions for used plastics by helping to enable a circular economy.

(6) Including inventory variations.

Trading operates extensively on physical and derivatives markets,
both organized and over the counter. In connection with its Trading
activities, TOTAL, like most other oil companies, uses derivative
energy instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options) in order
to adjust its exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil and
petroleum products. These transactions are entered into with a wide
variety of counterparties.

For additional information concerning derivatives transactions by
Trading & Shipping, see Note 16 (Financial instruments related to
commodity contracts) to the Consolidated Financial Statements (refer
to point 8.7 of chapter 8).

All of TOTAL's Trading activities are subject to strict internal controls
and trading limits.

2.3.2.2 Shipping

The transportation of crude oil and petroleum products necessary
for the activities of the Group is coordinated by Shipping.
These requirements are fulfilled through the balanced use of spot
and time-charter markets. Additional transport capacity can also be
used to transport third-party cargo. Shipping maintains a rigorous
safety policy, mainly through a strict selection of chartered vessels.

In 2018, Shipping chartered approximately 3,000 voyages (slightly
higher than 2017 and 2016) to transport 143 Mt of crude oil and
petroleum products, compared to 133 Mt in 2017 and 131 Mt in
2016. On December 31, 2018, the mid-term and long-term chartered
fleet amounted to 56 vessels (including 8 LPG vessels), compared to
59 in 2017 and in 2016. Shipping only charters vessels satisfying the
best international standards and the average age of the fleet is
approximately six years.

As part of its Shipping activity, the Group, like other oil companies
and ship owners, uses freight rate derivative contracts to adjust its
exposure to market fluctuations.

markets, with the signature in 2018 of a major partnership with an
Indian conglomerate, with an objective to build over time a retail
network of 1,500 service stations in India. In February 2019, Saudi

to accelerate the development of this network to quickly establish
coverage that meets its customers’ expectations, and will initially
target the freight transportation segment on its key European
markets (Germany, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands). TOTAL is also positioned on the American NGV
market following the acquisition of a 25% stake in Clean Energy
Fuels Corp., which is a leading supplier of natural gas fuel in

customers to other operators’ networks of charging points
through specific partnerships. The acquisition of G2Mobility will
enable the Group to also offer more efficient charging solutions
to its individual and professional customers.

the H, Mobility Germany joint-venture. This partnership was
created in 2015 with Air Liquide, Daimler, Linde, OMV and Shell,
to build a network that could reach 400 hydrogen stations in
Germany. The joint-venture aims to create an initial network of
around 100 stations by 2019, a third of which will be TOTAL
stations. In 2018, TOTAL's hydrogen stations represented nearly
one third of the around 50 stations rolled out by H, Mobility
Germany.

Natural gas for shipping: In order to meet the new emission
standards for marine fuels that will come into effect in 2020,

Angola, Culzean in the United Kingdom, Johan Sverdrup 1 & 2 in
Norway, Yamal LNG train 4 in Russia, Absheron in Azerbaijan and
Zinia 2 in Angola).

In the Gas, Renewables & Power segment, organic investments were
made mainly in the development of the project for three trains for
Cameron LNG in the United States, which entered the Group's scope
following the acquisition of Engie’s upstream LNG business, as well
as the projects to build solar power plants, managed by Total Solar
and the industrial activities of Saft Groupe and SunPower.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, organic investments were
made, on the one hand, in the safety and maintenance of facilities,
and, on the other hand, in projects aimed at improving the
competitiveness of plants. In 2018, the Group continued the
transformation of the French refinery at La Méde into a biorefinery. In
addition, significant investments were approved, with the
development of petrochemical activities in Texas (United States) as
part of a joint-venture with Borealis and Nova, and a project to
increase the capacity of the Daesan integrated platform in South
Korea.

world’s second LNG actor"). This acquisition is expected to fully
benefit from the strong growth of the LNG market. In keeping with its
strategy to develop a profitable low-carbon electricity activity, TOTAL
finalized the acquisition of Direct Energie and of two gas power plants
from KKR-Energas. In the Marketing & Services segment, TOTAL
accelerated its growth in new energies for mobility with the acquisition
of 25% of the share capital of the Clean Energy Fuels Corp.” in the
United States and of G2Mobility in France. In the lubricants business,
the Group strengthened its position in Italy by finalizing in January
2018 the purchase of Erg’s 51% stake in the TotalErg joint-venture,
which has been terminated.

TOTAL pursued the dynamic management of its portfolio and finalized
divestments amounting to a total of $5.2 billion in 2018. In particular,
the Group sold its interests in the Martin Linge and Visund fields in
Norway, and in the Joslyn oil sands project. It also disposed of 1.47%
of its stake in the Fort Hills oil sands mining extraction project in Canada
and of 4% of the Ichthys LNG project in Australia. In the Marketing &
Services segment, TOTAL sold its interests in the distribution, refining
and LPG activities of TotalErg in Italy and its fuel distribution activities
in Haiti.

2.6 Research & Development

In 2018, the Group invested $986 million in R&D, compared to
$912 million in 2017 and $1,050 million in 2016. There were 4,288
people dedicated to R&D activities in 2018 compared to 4,132 in
2017 and 4,939 in 2016".

TOTAL's global investment to prepare the future of its oil and gas and
low-carbon electricity activities was approximately $1.1 billion.
This includes the entire R&D effort, as well as developments in the
fields of digital technology, technology and the investments funded
by Total Energy Ventures.

To achieve the Group's ambition to become the responsible energy
major, TOTAL R&D engages its employees in programs in five priority
areas that aim to address both the specific challenges in these
segments and the Group's transverse issues:

— safety in the broadest sense, including the safety of facilities, the
sustainable development of the Group's activities, control of its
environmental footprint and societal impacts as well as the
eco-design of products;

— operational efficiency, in terms of cost reductions, increased
productivity and, ultimately, competitive advantage, in both the
discovery and operation of energy resources and the integrity
and performance of the Group's industrial units in terms of
availability, industrial energy efficiency and the competitive
performance;

2.6.1 Transverse programs

In addition to a specific program dedicated to strategic anticipation,
seven transverse programs cover new and strategic sectors, or share
knowledge and infrastructures in the following areas:

— Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), with, for example, the
development of the TADI (Transverse Anomaly Detection
Infrastructure) platform that reproduces gas leak scenarios,
ranging from crisis management to environmental surveillance.
More than 20 acoustic or optical detection techniques were
tested in various campaigns in 2018, providing an open
innovation platform for potential suppliers and for discussions
with other industrial companies to select the best available
technologies for the detection and quantification of gas leaks,
and of methane in particular;

— CO, capture, use and storage (CCUS), such as the large-scale
Northern Lights research project in Norway, in which the Group
is involved alongside Shell and Equinor. The first phase of the
project relates to a storage capacity of approximately 1.5 Mt/y.
TOTAL also participates in two CCU innovation centers in Canada
with start-ups, looking into new technologies for the capture
of CO, and the conversion of CO, into intermediate products for
chemicals and materials. TOTAL has also joined three
demonstration centers for the storage of CO, for geomechanical
studies and studies of the control of CO, injection;

— energy efficiency, with, for example, the installation of the first
DIESTA cooling tower in a refinery to cool a distillate.
This technology was initially designed to cool and condense
propane for LNG cold generators;

— new services and products, including smart electricity grids,
energy management solutions for customers, mobility solutions,
the development of specific polymers, innovative and competitive
multi-functional materials, or new fluids for electric and hybrid
vehicles;

— _ an energy mix based on low-carbon energies combining gas
and LNG (liquefied natural gas) technologies, sun and wind
power, hybrid energy management systems, as well as battery
technologies, CO, capture, use and storage (CCUS)
technologies, bioproducts, such as biofuels and biopolymers,
and recycling; and

— digital technology, in the broadest sense, including
high-performance computing and blockchain technologies, data
sciences, the Internet of Things (loT), robotics and artificial
intelligence applied to the Group's activities.

The Group is investing in the preparation of its future in open
innovation by calling on its talents, its research infrastructures, its
pilot sites and its international research centers, as well as on
start-ups and top-level academic partners. Consequently, the Group
has 18 R&D centers worldwide and approximately 1,000 agreements.
with its partners.

Additionally, the Group implements an active industrial property policy
to protect its innovations, and to maximize their use and technological
differentiation. In 2018, the Group filed more than 200 patent
applications.

— gas, with, for example, an initiative that aims to map out the
different emerging technologies and to compare them with
baselines in terms of their carbon footprint, energy efficiency and
economic performance. This initiative is also being deployed for
the conversion of natural gas into high-added value molecules,
such as olefins (ethylene and propylene). The first material
balances produced by the partnership with GTC Technology, a
leading American actor in petrochemicals process engineering
on an international scale, are in line with the Group's expectations;

— digital technology, with the development of new digital seismic
imaging methods, artificial intelligence algorithms to optimize the
detection of hydrocarbons on surface water and refining
processes, and a digital simulator of the tribological phenomena
in lubricants;

— analysis and measurements, with, for example, the bases of a
methodology combining physico-chemical and olfactometric
analysis with digital methods in the Group's partnership with Ales
Mines. This methodology is of particular interest to the
improvement of the olfactory quality of materials, and of polymers
and composites in particular, and provides for greater
responsiveness in the event of odorous episodes in the vicinity
of the Group's industrial sites;

— understanding of process and product performance, with, for
example, the control of crude/water emulsions using an approach
based on modeling in collaboration with ETH Ztirich.

The anticipation program is carried out by forward-looking projects
that aim to assess the impact on the Group's businesses of new
technologies, such as nanotechnology, robotics or the mobility of the
future.

2.6.2 Business segment-specific programs

2.6.2.1 Exploration-Production segment

All of the R&D projects aim to combine environmental performance,
improved safety and economic viability of operations. A major asset
for R&D lies in the remarkable high-performance computing
capabilities of the Pangea supercomputer developed by the Group.

The goal of the teams in the Frontier Exploration program is to identify
geological concepts that will enable the potential of proved basins to
be reassessed and new potential basins for oil and gas exploration
to be envisaged.

Remote detection, airborne multiphysical acquisition systems for the
real-time imaging of steep margins, new-generation algorithms...
From the acquisition to the processing of data, the Earth Imaging
program innovates along the complete geophysical exploration chain
to produce high-added value 3D ultrasound images of the subsoil
more quickly and at a reduced cost.

The actions of the Field Reservoir program focus on our
understanding of the physico-chemical phenomena in reservoirs,
from pores to fields, and on the integration of all the available data.
The development of a new generation of reservoir modeling tools,
the continual improvement of reservoir simulation tools and the
development of low-cost enhanced recovery techniques are the key
themes of this program.

The Wells program aims to achieve the dual objectives of maximizing
the safety and operational efficiency of wells, thereby increasing their
profitability. This program, which provides real-time access to data
from well bottoms (during drilling) and from wells (in production), is
essential.

The main goals of the Deep Offshore & Next Generation Facilities
program consist of further cutting technical costs with completely
underwater development solutions, developing breakthrough
technologies to economically explore and develop assets at depths
of more than 3,000 meters, and designing disruptive operating modes.
offering higher profitability, without compromising safety.

Finally, the emphasis of the Unconventional program is on
fundamental research (multi-scale characterization of source rock
and the origins and expulsion of hydrocarbons) and on technical
innovations to optimize recovery. These efforts converge to guide
exploration towards the most promising geological strata and to
provide the technological keys to their profitable and responsible
use.

2.6.2.2 Gas, Renewables & Power segment

Today, the R&D activities concentrate on the testing and qualification
of solar panels and on photovoltaic electricity management systems.

In 2018, TOTAL's private laboratory, located on the premises of the
Institut Photovoltaique d’lle-de-France (IPVF) on the Paris-Saclay
cluster, was commissioned with a 1,000 m? clean room environment.
This leading-edge technological platform covers a large part of the
solar value chain, from the manufacture of solar cells and modules,
to the qualification and testing of technologies and systems under
real-life conditions. Its missions are to support the Group's
subsidiaries and to work on the development of competitive cells
and modules, in partnership with the IPVF in particular.

SunPower is pursuing its research, development and innovation
efforts to improve the performance of photovoltaic cells and modules,
while also cutting costs. Once its feasibility had been demonstrated,
the NGT (New Generation Technology) of photovoltaic cells was
integrated on a first production line. The module assembly technology
has also been transferred.

In addition, 2018 saw the ramp-up of work on smart electricity grids,
focusing on two key themes:

— the control and optimization of hybrid sites that combine several
energy sources and are used to store energy, and to control
electric loads in order to supply energy that is safer, more
affordable and cleaner in terms of CO, emissions;

— the launch of the Energy Management Platform (EMP) project, a
transverse center of excellence in the processing, acquisition
(lol) and presentation of data (user experience), and in data
science and artificial intelligence. The EMP is cooperating closely
with Digital and IT on some ten projects for different Group
entities.

Finally, in the realm of electricity storage, Saft Group and its European
partners have launched a program for the research, development
and industrialization of new generations of solid electrolyte lithium-ion
(Li-ion) batteries that are more efficient, cheaper and intrinsically
safer than current Li-ion batteries. R&D investments focus on
electrochemistry, new materials and improving production processes
and battery management systems and software. This program targets
every market segment, from electro-mobility (electric cars and buses,
the railroads, maritime and aviation sectors) and energy storage,
to specialized industries.

2.6.2.3 Refining & Chemicals segment

A) Refining & Chemicals (excluding Hutchinson)

The mission of R&D is to contribute to the technological differentiation
of the Refining & Chemicals activities by developing and implementing
new and more efficient solutions to create value. It opens the way to
the industrialization of knowledge, processes and technologies.

R&D places special emphasis on the three major challenges facing
Refining & Chemicals: limiting the environmental footprint; achieving
excellence in processes and operations; and developing innovative
products, in particular biosourced products.

Research is focused on the integrity, availability and improved energy
efficiency of refining and petrochemicals facilities. As a result,
advanced modeling of feedstocks and processes is used to optimize
processing from the monthly supply of the platforms to the real-time
monitoring of the facilities’ constraints. Research conducted on
catalysts and their selection is helping to increase performance,
improve stability and extend their service life at a lower cost.

In order to contribute to the limitation of the carbon footprint, R&D is
looking into new processes, such as in the area of electro-catalysis
and biosourced raw materials. It studies the catalytic solutions of the
future, paving the way for nanocatalysis.

It designs the technologies that will be used to develop new and
more efficient products containing recycled materials (polystyrene in
particular), while retaining all the applicative properties of the end
product. Additionally, R&D draws on its knowledge of metallocenes
and bimodality to develop different types of mass consumption
polymers that have exceptional properties allowing them to replace
heavier materials and compete with technical polymers.

Finally, Refining & Chemicals’ R&D is developing technologies
enabling more efficient use of biosourced molecules. The aim is to
produce higher added-value chemical compounds, whether through
biotechnologies or thermochemical processes. In this area, the
studies focus on the processes to convert plant oils, sugar or
lignocellulose in order to produce sustainable bioplastics and biofuels
as well as to extend the range of feedstocks that can be used in

Research & Development

existing facilities. R&D is also particularly mindful of issues related to
blends and product quality raised by the use of biomolecules.

B) Elastomer processing (Hutchinson)

R&D is an important factor in innovation and differentiation for
Hutchinson, which is present along the entire value chain, from
designing custom materials (e.g., rubber, thermoplastics, composites)
to incorporating connected solutions and objects (e.g., complex
solutions, mechatronics, hardware, software, systems, loT, big data,
etc.).

With a corporate research and innovation center, more than
25 technical centers and a number of university partnerships
worldwide, Hutchinson is equipped to rise to the challenge of
contributing to a safer, more comfortable, and more responsible
mobility of the future.

Weight reduction, increased energy efficiency, improved diagnostic
and control functionality and greater acoustic and vibratory comfort
are common preoccupations across all of Hutchinson's markets (e.g.,
automotive, aerospace, defense, railways). Hutchinson designs
innovative solutions that put its customers ahead of the game, and
transposes those solutions between markets, adopting a cross-
fertilization approach.

2.6.2.4 Marketing & Services segment

The Marketing & Services segment’s R&D remains focused, on the
one hand, on the optimization of the competitive advantage of
products on the consumer and professional markets, and, on the
other, on the acquisition of skills in artificial intelligence (digital
simulation, molecular modeling, data science) in order to respond to
market demands more quickly.

One of R&D's main missions is the design and development of
Premium fuels and lubricants offering customer benefits based on
the reduction of the environmental footprint, improved energy
efficiency and the greater durability of products and equipment.
By way of example, the development of a new detergent for fuels
selected by a world-leading partner has entered the first pilot
production phase. Likewise, a new additive to improve the
performance of cold road diesel is now in industrial production.

The formulation of Fuel Economy lubricants is a short- and
medium-priority for all segments (automotive, marine and industry).
The R&D teams are pursuing their efforts to incorporate specific new
components developed with partners, such as fluid lubricating bases
or polymers with a targeted rheological profile. The Fuel Economy
program also includes engines for heavy goods vehicles and
stationary engines. TOTAL is taking an active part in the multi-partner
FALCON (Flexible & Aerodynamic truck for Low CONsumption)
project led by Volvo. Regarding marine lubricants, the method
developed by the Group to quantify the efficiency of lubricants in
neutralizing acid combustion gases has been recognized and
rewarded by the ASTM standardization organization.

The R&D teams are working on the design of ranges of lubricants
adapted to natural gas, in particular in liquefied form, for long-distance
heavy goods vehicles and maritime transport.

The Electric Vehicles Fluids program resulted in the launch of a
pioneering range of fluids for electric and hybrid vehicles. These
products, which are the fruit of major efforts made by the Group's
R&D teams, were developed specially to meet the cooling and
lubrication needs of the different components of these new drive
systems, so that they can work under optimal conditions.

In the field of special fluids, the Group's research center in India has
developed an aqueous anti-friction sludge for drilling.

In the realm of road binders, the first industrial and commercial
successes have confirmed a new process to prepare chemical
bitumen-polymer mixtures with a reduced environmental footprint.
The |-Street innovation project led by Eiffage, in a consortium with
TOTAL and other partners, won the Ademe's Route du Futur call for
projects. TOTAL is also part of the GLOBE program, which is aiming
to create a logistical solution for bitumen granules that stretches from
the refinery to the point of use.

The Biolab biocomponents laboratory, inaugurated in 2016 and
common to the Marketing & Services and Refining & Chemicals
segments, acquired a new skill in biofermentation in the summer of
2018. On the one hand, a process for the synthesis of renewable
components has been patented, and, on the other, the first trials of
renewable multi-functional lubricants revealed some promising
performances.

In 2018, Marketing & Services R&D intensified its open innovation
projects and entered new partnerships in France and abroad (such
as the partnership with the University of Aachen, Germany). It also
received more than 1,000 visitors to present its technological
innovations to partners, customers, prospects and stakeholders.

2.7. Property, plant and equipment

The companies of the Group have freehold and leasehold interests in
over 130 countries throughout the world. Operations in properties,
cil and gas fields or any other industrial, commercial or administrative
facility, as well as the production capacities and utilization rates of
these facilities, are described in this chapter for each business
segment (Exploration & Production, Gas, Renewables & Power,
Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services).

A summary of the Group’s property, plant and equipment and their
main related expenses (depreciation and impairment) is included
in Note 7.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (point 8.7 of
chapter 8).

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

3.1 Risk Factors

The Group conducts its activities in an ever-changing environment
and is exposed to risks that, if they were to occur, could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, including
its operating income and cash flow, reputation or outlook.

The Group employs a continuous process of identifying and analyzing
risks in order to determine those that could prevent it from achieving
its objectives. This chapter presents the significant risks to which the
Group believes it is exposed as of the date of this Registration
Document. However, as of such date, the Group may not be aware

of, or may be underestimating the potential consequences of, other
risks that could, or other risks may not have been considered by the
Group as being likely to have a material adverse impact on the Group,
its business, financial condition, including its operating income and
cash flow, reputation or outlook.

The main internal control and risk management procedures,
in particular those relating to the preparation and processing of
accounting and financial information, are described in point 3.3 of
this chapter.

3.1.1 Risks related to market environment and other financial risks

The financial performance of TOTAL is sensitive to a number of
market environment related factors, the most significant being
hydrocarbon prices, refining margins and exchange rates.

Generally, a decline in hydrocarbon prices has a negative effect on
the Group's results due to a decrease in revenues from oil and gas
production. Conversely, a rise in hydrocarbon prices increases the
Group's results.

In 2018, at first, oil prices increased to reach their highest point in
October above $80 per barrel, supported by supply tensions and
geopolitics. Prices then decreased to below $60 per barrel by the
end of the year, mainly driven by record production in the United
States. In December, OPEC and Russia announced a production cut
to mitigate the price drop. The oil and natural gas markets remain
highly volatile.

For the fiscal year 2019, according to the scenarios retained below,
the Group estimates that an increase of $10 per barrel in the average
liquids price would increase annual adjusted net operating income”)
by approximately $2.7 billion and annual cash flow from operations
by approximately $3.2 billion. Conversely, a decrease of $10 per
barrel in the average liquids price would decrease annual adjusted

net operating income by approximately $2.7 billion and annual cash
flow from operations by approximately $3.2 billion.

The impact of changes in crude oil and gas prices on downstream
operations depends upon the speed at which the prices of finished
products adjust to reflect these changes. The Group estimates that
a decrease in its European Refining Margin Indicator (“ERMI") of
$10 per ton would decrease annual adjusted net operating income
by approximately $0.5 billion and annual cash flow from operations
by approximately $0.6 billion. Conversely, an increase in its ERMI of
$10 per ton would increase annual adjusted net operating income by
approximately $0.5 billion and annual cash flow from operations by
approximately $0.6 billion.

All of the Group's activities are, for various reasons and to varying
degrees, sensitive to fluctuations in the dollar/euro exchange rate.
The Group estimates that a decrease of $0.10 per euro (strengthening
of the dollar versus the euro) would increase annual adjusted net
operating income by approximately $0.1 billion and have a limited
impact on annual cash flow from operations. Conversely, an increase
of $0.10 per euro (weakening of the dollar versus the euro) would
decrease adjusted net operating income by approximately $0.1 billion
and have a limited impact on annual cash flow from operations.

attributable essentially to Refining & Chemicals.
(b) Brent environment at 60 $/b.

In addition to the adverse effect on the Group’s revenues,
margins and profitability, a prolonged period of low oil and
natural gas prices could lead the Group to review its projects
and the evaluation of its assets and oil and natural gas reserves.

Prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely due to many
factors over which TOTAL has no control. These factors include:

— variations in global and regional supply of and demand for energy;

— global and regional economic and political developments in
natural resource-producing regions, particularly in the Middle
East, Africa and South America, as well as in Russia;

— the ability of the OPEC and other producing nations to influence
global production levels and prices;

— prices of unconventional energies as well as evolving approaches,
for developing oil sands and shale oil, which may affect the
Group's realized prices, notably under its long-term gas sales
contracts and asset valuations, particularly in North America;

— cost and availability of new technologies;
— regulations and governmental actions;

— global economic and financial market conditions;

(1) Adjusted results are defined as income at replacement cost, excluding special items and the impact of fair value changes.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

— the security situation in certain regions, the magnitude of
international terrorist threats, wars or other conflicts;

— changes in demographics, notably population growth rates, and
consumer preferences; and

— _ adverse weather conditions that can disrupt supplies or interrupt
operations of the Group's facilities.

Prolonged periods of low oil and natural gas prices may reduce the
economic viability of projects in production or in development and
reduce the Group's liquidity, thereby decreasing its ability to finance
capital expenditures and/or causing it to cancel or postpone
investment projects.

If TOTAL were unable to finance its investment projects, the Group's
opportunities for future revenues and profitability growth would be
reduced, which could materially negatively impact the Group's
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

Prolonged periods of low oil and natural gas prices may reduce the
Group's reported reserves and cause the Group to revise the price
assumptions upon which asset impairment tests are based, which
could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's results in the
period in which it occurs. For additional information on impairments
recognized on the Group's assets, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements (point 8.7 of chapter 8).

Conversely, in a high oil and gas price environment, the Group can
experience significant increases in cost and government take, and,
under some production-sharing contracts, the Group's production
rights could be reduced. Higher prices can also reduce demand for
the Group's products.

The Group's results from its Refining & Chemicals and Marketing &
Services segments are primarily dependent upon the supply and
demand for petroleum products and the associated margins on sales
of these products, with the impact of changes in oil and gas prices
on results on these segments being dependent upon the speed at
which the prices of petroleum products adjust to reflect movements

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

in oil and gas prices. In 2018, the positive effects of higher oil and
gas prices on the Group's results have been greater than the
decrease of the results of the Refining & Chemicals segment. The
Group's refining margins remain highly volatile.

The activities of Trading & Shipping (oil, gas and power trading and
shipping activities) are particularly sensitive to market risk and more
specifically to price risk as a consequence of the volatility of oil and
gas prices, to liquidity risk (inability to buy or sell cargoes at market
prices) and to counterparty risk (when a counterparty does not fulfill
its contractual obligations). The Group uses various energy derivative
instruments and freight-rate instruments to reduce its exposure to
price fluctuations of crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, power
and freight-rates. Although TOTAL believes it has established
appropriate risk management procedures, large market fluctuations
may adversely affect the Group's activities and financial condition,
including its operating income and cash flow.

For more detailed information on the impact of oil and gas prices on
the Group's 2018 results, financial condition (including impairments)
and outlook, refer to point 1.4 of chapter 1.

TOTAL is exposed to other financial risks related to its financing
and cash management activities.

The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign
exchange rates. Even though the Group generally seeks to minimize
the currency exposure of each entity with regards to its functional
currency (primarily the dollar, the euro, the pound sterling and the
Norwegian krone), the Group's financial condition, including its
operating income and cash flow, could be impacted by a significant
change in the value of these currencies.

In addition, as TOTAL mostly turns to financial markets for its external
financing, its financial condition and operations could be materially
impacted if access to those markets were to become more difficult.

For further information on financial risks, refer to Notes 15 and 16 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements (point 8.7 of chapter 8).

3.1.2 Industrial and environmental risks and risks related to climate issues

TOTAL is exposed to risks related to the safety and security of
its operations.

The Group's activities involve a wide range of operational risks, such
as explosions, fires, accidents, equipment failures, leakage of toxic
products, emissions or discharges into the air, water or soil, that can
potentially cause death or injury, or impact natural resources and
ecosystems.

The industrial event that could have the most significant impact is a
major industrial accident, e.g., blow out, explosion, fire, leakage of
highly toxic products or massive leakage, resulting in death or injury
and/or accidental pollution on a large-scale or at an environmentally
sensitive site.

Acts of terrorism or malicious acts against employees, plants, sites,
pipelines and transportation or computer systems of the Group's or
its contractors could also disrupt the Group's business activities and
could cause harm or damage to people, property and the environment

and could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial
condition.

Certain activities of the Group face additional specific risks. TOTAL's
Exploration & Production activities are exposed to risks related to the
physical characteristics of oil and gas fields, particularly during drilling
operations, which can cause blow outs, explosions, fires or other
damage, in particular to the environment, and lead to a disruption of
the Group's operations or reduce its production. In addition to the
risks of explosions and fires, the activities of the Gas, Renewables &
Power", Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services business
segments entail risks related to the overall life cycle of the products
manufactured, as well as the materials used. With regard to
transportation, the likelihood of an operational accident depends not
only on the hazardous nature of the products transported, but also
on the volumes involved and the sensitivity of the regions through
which they are transported (quality of infrastructure, population
density, environment).

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

TOTAL’s workforce and the public are exposed to risks inherent to
the Group's operations, which could lead to legal proceedings against
the Group's entities and legal representatives, notably in cases of
death, injury and property and environmental damage. Such
proceedings could also damage the Group's reputation. In addition,
like most industrial groups, TOTAL is concerned by declarations of
occupational illnesses.

To manage the operational risks to which it is exposed, the Group
has adopted a preventive and remedial approach by putting in place
centralized HSE (health, safety and environment) and security
management systems that seek to take all necessary measures to
reduce the related risks (refer to points 5.4 and 5.5 of chapter 5).
In addition, the Group maintains third-party liability insurance
coverage for all its subsidiaries. TOTAL also has insurance to protect
against the risk of damage to Group property and/or business
interruption at its main refining and petrochemical sites. TOTAL’s
insurance and risk management policies are described in point 3.4 of
this chapter. However, the Group is not insured against all potential
risks. In certain cases, such as a major environmental disaster,
TOTAL's liability may exceed the maximum coverage provided by its
third-party liability insurance. The Group cannot guarantee that it will
not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no guarantee,
particularly in the event of a major environmental disaster or industrial
accident, that such loss would not have a material adverse effect on
the Group's financial condition, including its operating income and
cash flow, and its reputation.

Crisis management systems are necessary to effectively respond
to emergencies, avoid potential disruptions to the Group’s
business and operations and minimize impacts on third parties
or the environment.

The Group has crisis management plans in place to deal with
emergencies (refer to point 5.5 of chapter 5). However, these plans
cannot exclude the risk that the Group’s business and operations
may be severely disrupted in a crisis situation or ensure the absence
of impacts on third parties or the environment. TOTAL has also
implemented business continuity plans to continue or resume
operations following a shutdown or incident. An inability for the Group.
to resume its activities in a timely manner could prolong the impact
of any disruption and thus could have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

TOTAL is subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health
and safety laws and regulations in numerous countries and may
incur material related compliance costs.

The Group's activities are subject to numerous laws and regulations
pertaining to the environment, health and safety. In most countries
where the Group operates, particularly in Europe and the United
States, sites and products are subject to increasingly stringent laws
governing the protection of the environment (water, air, soil, noise,
protection of nature, waste management and impact assessments,
etc.), health (occupational safety and chemical product risk, etc.) and
the safety of personnel and residents. Product quality and consumer
protection are also subject to increasingly strict regulations. The
Group's entities ensure that their products meet applicable
specifications and abide by all applicable consumer protection laws.
Failure to do so could lead to personal injury, property damage,
environmental harm and loss of customers, which could negatively
impact the Group's financial condition, including its operating income
and cash flow, and its reputation.

(1) As from 2021 or the current price in a given country.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

TOTAL incurs and will continue to incur substantial expenditures to
comply with increasingly complex laws and regulations aimed at
protecting health, safety and the environment. Such expenditures
could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition.

The introduction of new laws and regulations could compel the Group
to curtail, modify or cease certain operations or implement temporary
shutdowns of sites, which could diminish productivity and have a
material adverse impact on its financial condition.

Moreover, pursuant to applicable regulations, most of the Group's
activities will require, at site closure, decommissioning followed by
environmental remediation after operations are discontinued. Costs
related to such activities may materially exceed the Group's provisions
and adversely impact its operating incomes. With regard to the
definitive shutdown of activities, the Group's environmental
contingencies and asset retirement obligations are addressed in the
“Asset retirement obligations” and “Provisions for environmental
contingencies” sections of the Group's consolidated balance sheet
(refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, point
8.7 of chapter 8). Future expenditures related to asset retirement
obligations are accounted for in accordance with the accounting
principles described in the same Note.

Laws and regulations related to climate change as well as
growing concern of stakeholders may adversely affect the
Group’s business and financial condition.

Firstly, there is a risk incurred by rapidly changing modes of energy
production in favor of a lower-carbon energy mix that allows for a
more limited share of fossil fuel. This could impact the Group's
business model, profitability, financial situation and shareholder value.

The growing concern of certain stakeholders with regards to climate
change could also have an impact on certain external financing of
the Group's projects or influence certain investors involved in the oil
and gas sector.

Moreover, regulations may change and require the Group to reduce,
change or cease certain operations, and subject it to additional
obligations with regards to the compliance of its facilities. This could
have a negative effect on its activities and its financial situation,
including operating income and cash flow. Regulations designed to
gradually limit fossil fuel use may, depending on the GHG emission
limits and time horizons set, negatively and significantly affect the
development of projects, as well as the economic value of certain of
the Group's assets. In Europe, for example, the Group's industrial
facilities are part of the CO, emissions quotas market (EU-ETS), and
the financial risk incurred by purchasing these quotas on the market
could increase due to the reform of the system that was approved in
2018. This emission quotas market is in its third phase. The Group
estimates that about 25% of emissions subjected to EU-ETS are not
covered by free quotas in the period 2013-2020 (phase 3) and to
30% or more from 2021 to 2030 (phase 4). At the end of 2018, the
price of these quotas was about €20/t, and the Group expects this
price to be higher than €30/t in phase 4.

Internal studies conducted by TOTAL have shown that a
long-term CO, price of $40/t) applied worldwide would have a
negative impact of around 5% on the discounted present value of
the Group's assets (upstream and downstream). In addition, the
average lifespan of the Group's proved and probable reserves is
approximately 20 years, while the discounted present value of those
reserves beyond the 20 years represents less than 10% of the
discounted present value of the Group's upstream assets.


--- Page 74 ---

Finally, the Company and several of its subsidiaries have received
claims issued by public entities in certain countries in view of financing
the protective measures to be implemented in order to limit the
consequences of climate change. The Group is subject to the risk of
judicial actions in this area.

The physical effects of climate change may adversely affect the
Group’s business.

TOTAL's businesses operate in various regions, where the potential
physical impacts of climate change, including changes in weather
patterns, are highly uncertain and may adversely impact the Group's
operating income.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

Climate change potentially has multiple effects that could harm the
Group's operations. The increasing scarcity of water resources may
negatively affect the Group's operations in some regions of the world,
high sea levels may harm certain coastal activities, and the
multiplication of extreme weather events may damage offshore and
onshore facilities. These climate risk factors are continually assessed
in the risk management and prevention plans.

The Group believes that it is impossible to guarantee that the
contingencies or liabilities related to the matters mentioned in this
point 3.1.2 would not have a material adverse impact on its business,
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow,
reputation, prospects or shareholder value, if such risks were to occur.

3.1.3. Risks related to critical IT systems security

Disruption to or breaches of TOTAL’s critical IT services or
information security systems could adversely affect the Group’s
activities.

The Group's activities depend heavily on the reliability and security of
its information technology (IT) systems. The Group's IT systems,
some of which are managed by third parties, are susceptible to being
compromised, damaged, disrupted or shutdown due to failures
during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or
components, power or network outages, hardware failures,
cyber-attacks (viruses, computer intrusions), user errors or natural
disasters. The cyber threat is constantly evolving. Attacks are
becoming more sophisticated with regularly renewed techniques
while the digital transformation amplifies exposure to these cyber
threats. The adoption of new technologies, such as the Internet of
things (loT) or the migration to the cloud, as well as the evolution of
architectures for increasingly interconnected systems, are all areas
where cyber security is a very important issue. The Group and its

service providers may not be able to prevent third parties from
breaking into the Group’s IT systems, disrupting business operations
or communications infrastructure through denial-of-service attacks,
or gaining access to confidential or sensitive information held in the
system. The Group, like many companies, has been and expects to
continue to be the target of attempted cybersecurity attacks. While
the Group has not experienced any such attack that has had a
material impact on its business, the Group cannot guarantee that its
security measures will be sufficient to prevent a material disruption,
breach or compromise in the future.

As a result, the Group's activities and assets could sustain serious
damage, services to clients could be interrupted, material intellectual
property could be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury,
property damage, environmental harm and regulatory violations could
occur, potentially having a material adverse effect on the Group's
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

3.1.4 Risks related to the development of major projects and reserves

The Group’s production growth and profitability depend on the
delivery of its major development projects.

Growth of production and profitability of the Group rely heavily on the
successful execution of its major development projects that are
increasingly complex and capital-intensive. These major projects may
face a number of difficulties, including, in particular, those related to:

— economic or political risks, including threats specific to a certain
country or region, such as terrorism, social unrest or other
conflicts (refer to point 3.1.6 of this chapter);

— negotiations with partners, governments, local communities,
suppliers, customers and other third parties;

— _ obtaining project financing;
— controlling capital and operating costs;

— earning an adequate return in a low oil and/or gas price
environment;

— _ respecting project schedules; and

— the timely issuance or renewal of permits and licenses by public
agencies.

Poor delivery of any major project that underpins production or
production growth could adversely affect the Group’s financial
condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

The Group’s long-term profitability depends on cost-effective
discovery, acquisition and development of economically viable
new reserves; if the Group is unsuccessful, its financial
condition, including its operating income and cash flow, could
be materially affected.

A large portion of the Group's revenues and operating results are
derived from the sale of oil and gas that the Group extracts from
underground reserves developed as part of its Exploration &
Production activities. The development of oil and gas fields, the
construction of facilities and the drilling of production or injection
wells is capital intensive and requires advanced technology. Due to
constantly changing market conditions and environmental challenges,
cost projections can be uncertain. For Exploration & Production
activities to continue to be profitable, the Group needs to replace its
reserves with new proved reserves (likely to be developed and
produced in an economically viable manner).

In addition, a number of factors may undermine TOTAL's ability to
discover, acquire and develop new reserves, which are inherently
uncertain, including:

— the geological nature of oil and gas fields, notably unexpected
drilling conditions, including pressure or unexpected
heterogeneities in geological formations;

— the risk of dry holes or failure to find expected commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons;

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

— equipment failures, fires, blow-outs or accidents;

— shortages or delays in the availability or delivery of appropriate
equipment;

— _ the Group's inability to develop or implement new technologies
that enable access to previously inaccessible fields;

— the Group's inability to anticipate market changes in a timely
manner;

— adverse weather conditions;

— the inability of the Group's partners to execute or finance projects
in which the Group holds an interest or to meet their contractual
obligations;

— the inability of service companies to deliver contracted services
on time and on budget;

— compliance with both anticipated and unanticipated
governmental requirements, including U.S. and EU regulations
‘that may give a competitive advantage to companies not subject
to such regulations;

— economic or political risks, including threats specific to a certain
country or region, such as terrorism, social unrest or other
conflicts (refer to point 3.1.6 of this chapter);

— competition from oil and gas companies for the acquisition and
development of assets and licenses (refer to point 3.1.7 of this
chapter);

— increased taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims and
changes in regulations and tax reassessments; and

— disputes related to property titles.

These factors could lead to cost overruns and/or could impair the
Group's ability to complete a development project or make production
economical. Some of these factors may also affect the Group's
projects and facilities further down the oil and gas chain.

If TOTAL fails to develop new reserves cost-effectively and in sufficient
quantities, the Group's financial condition, including its operating
income and cash flow, could be materially affected.

The Group’s oil and gas reserves data are estimates only
and subsequent upward or downward adjustments are possible.
If actual production from such reserves proves to be lower than
current estimates indicate, the Group’s financial condition,
including its operating income and cash flow, could be impacted.

The Group's proved reserves figures are estimates prepared in
accordance with SEC rules. Proved reserves are those reserves
which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically
recoverable — from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and
under existing economic conditions, operating methods and
government regulations — prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that
renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or
probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Reserves are
estimated by teams of qualified, experienced and trained
geoscientists and petroleum, gas and project engineers, who
rigorously review and analyze in detail all available geoscience and
engineering data (for example, seismic data, electrical logs, cores,
fluids, pressures, flow rates and facilities parameters). This process
involves making subjective judgments, including with respect to the
estimate of hydrocarbons initially in place, initial production rates and
recovery efficiency, based on available geological, technical and
economic data. Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact
measurements and are subject to revision.

A variety of factors that are beyond the Group's control could cause
such estimates to be adjusted downward in the future, or cause the
Group's actual production to be lower than its currently reported
proved reserves indicate. Such factors include:

— a prolonged period of low prices of oil or gas, making reserves
no longer economically viable to exploit and therefore not
classifiable as proved;

— an increase in the price of oil or gas, which may reduce the
reserves to which the Group is entitled under production sharing
and risked service contracts and other contractual terms;

— changes in tax rules and other regulations that make reserves no
longer economically viable to exploit, or disputes related to
property titles; and

— the actual production performance of the Group's deposits.

The Group's reserves estimates may therefore require substantial
downward revisions should its subjective judgments prove not to
have been conservative enough based on the available geoscience
and engineering data, or the Group's assumptions regarding factors
or variables that are beyond its control prove to be incorrect over
time. Any downward adjustment could indicate lower future
production amounts, which could adversely affect the Group's
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

3.1.5 Risks related to equity affiliates and management of assets operated by

third parties

Many of the Group’s projects are conducted by equity affiliates
or are operated by third parties. For these projects, the Group’s
degree of control, as well as its ability to identify and manage
risks, may be reduced.

A significant number of the Group's projects are conducted by equity
affiliates or operated by third parties. In cases where the Group's
company is not the operator, such company may have limited
influence over, and control of, the behavior, performance and costs
of the partnership, its ability to manage risks may be limited and it
may, nevertheless, be prosecuted by regulators or claimants in the
event of an incident.

Additionally, the partners of the Group may not be able to meet their
financial or other obligations to the projects, which may threaten the
viability of a given project. These partners may also not have the
financial capacity to fully indemnify the Group or third parties in the
event of an incident.

With respect to joint-ventures, contractual terms generally provide
that the operator, whether an entity of the Group or a third party,
assumes full liability for damages caused by its gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

(1) For additional information, refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (point 8.7 of chapter 8).

TOTAL Registration Document 2018


--- Page 76 ---

In the absence of the operator's gross negligence or willful misconduct,
other liabilities are generally borne by the joint-venture and the cost
thereof is assumed by the partners of the joint-venture in proportion
to their respective ownership interests.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

With respect to third-party providers of goods and services, the amount
and nature of the liability assumed by the third party depends on the
context and may be limited by contract. Contracts may also contain
obligations to indemnify TOTAL or for TOTAL to indemnify partners
or third parties.

3.1.6 Risks related to political or economic factors

TOTAL has significant production and reserves located in
politically, economically and socially unstable areas, where the
risk that the Group’s operations may be materially affected is
relatively high.

A significant portion of TOTAL's oil and gas production and reserves
is located in countries that are not part of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In recent years,
a number of these countries have experienced varying degrees of
one or more of the following: economic or political instability, civil
war, violent conflict, social unrest, actions of terrorist groups and the
application of international economic sanctions. Any of these
conditions alone or in combination could disrupt the Group's
operations in any of these regions, causing substantial declines in
production or revisions to reserves estimates.

In Africa (excluding North Africa), which represented 24% of the
Group's 2018 combined liquids and gas production, certain of the
countries in which the Group has production have recently suffered
from some of these conditions, including Nigeria, which is one of the
main contributing countries to the Group's production of
hydrocarbons (refer to point 2.1.9 of chapter 2).

The Middle East and North Africa zone, which represented 24% of
the Group's 2018 combined liquids and gas production, has in recent
years suffered increased political instability in connection with violent
conflict and social unrest, particularly in Libya and Syria, where the
European Union (EU) and the U.S. have enacted economic sanctions
prohibiting TOTAL from producing oil and gas since 2011. In Yemen,
the deterioration of security conditions in the vicinity of the Balhaf site
caused the company Yemen LNG, in which the Group holds a stake
of 39.62%, to stop its commercial production and export of LNG
and to declare force majeure to its various stakeholders in 2015.
The plant has been put in preservation mode. In Iran, TOTAL signed
in July 2017 a 20-year contract with the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC) relating to the development and production of phase 11
(SP11) of the giant South Pars gas field. Following the withdrawal of
the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on
May 8, 2018, TOTAL withdrew from this project and finalized its
withdrawal on October 29, 2018, prior to the re-imposition of US
secondary sanctions on the oil industry as of November 5, 2018.
TOTAL was the operator and had a 50.1% interest alongside the
Chinese state-owned company CNPC (30%) and Petropars (19.9%);
a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIOC. TOTAL ceased all operational
activity in lran before November 4, 2018.

In South America, which represented 6% of the Group's 2018
combined liquids and gas production, certain of the countries in
which TOTAL has production have recently suffered from political or
economic instability, including Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela.

Since July 2014, international economic sanctions have been
adopted against certain Russian individuals and entities, including
various entities operating in the financial, energy and defense sectors.
As of December 31, 2018, TOTAL held 21% of its proved reserves in
Russia, from which the Group had 14% of its combined oil and gas
production in 2018.

For additional information concerning international economic
sanctions applicable notably to Cuba, Iran, Russia, Syria and
Venezuela, refer to point 3.1.9.1 of this chapter.

Furthermore, in addition to current production, TOTAL is also
exploring for and developing, or is participating in the exploration
and/or development of, new reserves in other regions of the world
that are historically characterized by political, social or economic
instability.

The occurrence and magnitude of incidents related to economic,
social or political instability are unpredictable. It is possible that they
could have a material adverse impact on the Group's production and
operations in the future and/or cause certain investors to reduce
their holdings of TOTAL's securities.

TOTAL, like other major international energy companies, has a
geographically diverse portfolio of reserves and operational sites,
which allows it to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to
reduce its exposure to political and economic risks. However, there
can be no assurance that such events will not have negative
consequences on the Group.

Intervention by host country authorities can adversely affect the
Group’s activities and its operating incomes.

TOTAL has significant exploration and production activities, and in
some cases refining, marketing or chemicals operations, in countries
whose governmental and regulatory framework is subject to
unexpected change and where the enforcement of contractual rights
is uncertain. The legal framework of TOTAL's exploration and
production activities, established through concessions, licenses,
permits and contracts granted by or entered into with a government
entity, a state-owned company or private owners, is subject to risks
of renegotiation that, in certain cases, can reduce or challenge the
protections offered by the initial legal framework and/or the economic
benefit to TOTAL.

In addition, the Group's exploration and production activities in such
countries are often undertaken in conjunction with state-owned
entities, for example as part of a joint-venture in which the state has
a significant degree of control. In recent years, in various regions
globally, TOTAL has observed governments and state-owned
enterprises impose more stringent conditions on companies pursuing
exploration and production activities in their respective countries,
increasing the costs and uncertainties of the Group's business
operations. TOTAL expects this trend to continue.

Potential increasing intervention by governments in such countries
can take a wide variety of forms, including:

— the award or denial of exploration and production interests;

— the imposition of specific drilling obligations;

— price and/or production quota controls and export limits;

—_ nationalization or expropriation of assets;

— unilateral cancellation or modification of license or contract rights;

— increases in taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims and
changes in regulations and tax reassessments;

— the renegotiation of contracts;
— the imposition of increased local content requirements;
— _ payment delays; and

— currency exchange restrictions or currency devaluation.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

If a host government were to intervene in one of these forms in a
country where TOTAL has substantial operations, including
exploration, the Group could incur material costs or the Group's
production or asset value could decrease, which could potentially
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, including its
operating income and cash flow.

For example, the Nigerian government has been contemplating new
legislation to govern the petroleum industry which, if passed into law,
could have an impact on the existing and future activities of the
Group in that country through increased taxes and/or operating costs
and could affect financial returns from projects in that country.

3.1.7. Risks related to competition and lack of innovation

The Group operates in a highly competitive environment. Its
competitiveness could be adversely impacted if the Group’s
level of innovation lagged behind its competitors.

TOTAL's main competitors are comprised of national (companies
directly or indirectly controlled by a state) and international oil
companies. The evolution of the energy sector has opened the door
to new competitors and increased market price volatility.

TOTAL is subject to competition in the acquisition of assets and
licenses for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas as
well as for the sale of manufactured products based on crude and
refined oil. In the gas sector, major producers increasingly compete
in the downstream value chain with established distribution
companies. Increased competitive pressure could have a significant
negative effect on the prices, margins and market shares of the
Group's companies.

The pursuit of unconventional gas development, particularly in the
United States, has contributed to falling hydrocarbon market prices
and a marked difference between spot and long-term contract prices.
The competitiveness of long-term contracts indexed to oil prices

could be affected if this discrepancy persists and if it should prove
difficult to invoke price revision clauses.

The Group's activities are carried out in a constantly changing
environment with new products and technologies continuously
emerging. The Group may not be able to anticipate these changes,
identify and integrate technological developments in order to maintain
its competitiveness, maintain a high level of performance and
operational excellence, and best meet the needs and demands of its
customers. The Group's innovation policy requires significant
investment, notably in R&D, of which the expected impact cannot be
guaranteed.

In the field of R&D, the multiplication of research partnerships, in
particular in related technical fields, may make it difficult for the Group
to track technical information exchanged with research partners and
monitor related contractual restrictions (e.g., confidentiality, limited
use). New and increasingly complex digital technologies as well as
the multiplication of partnerships are all likely to increase
contamination risks, which could, as a result, limit TOTAL's ability to
exploit innovations.

3.1.8 Ethical misconduct and non-compliance risks

Ethical misconduct or non-compliance of the Group or its
employees with applicable laws could expose TOTAL to criminal
and civil penalties and be damaging to TOTAL’s reputation and
shareholder value.

The Group's Code of Conduct, which applies to all of its employees,
defines TOTAL’s commitment to ethical standards, business integrity,
human rights and compliance with applicable legal requirements.
TOTAL maintains a “zero tolerance” principle for fraud of any kind,
particularly bribery, corruption and_ influence peddling.
Non-compliance with laws and regulations as well as ethical or human
rights misconduct by TOTAL, its employees or a third-party acting
on its behalf could expose TOTAL and/or its employees to
investigations, criminal and civil sanctions and to additional penalties
(such as debarment from public procurement). Further measures

could, depending on applicable legislation (notably, the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, the French law
n° 2016-1691 dated December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, the
fight against corruption and modernization of the economy or the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with regard to the protection of personal
data), be imposed by competent authorities, such as the review and
reinforcement of the compliance program under the supervision of
an independent third party. Any of the above could be damaging to
the financial condition, shareholder value or reputation of the Group.

Generally, entities of the Group could potentially be subject to
administrative, judicial or arbitration proceedings that could have a
material adverse impact on the Group's financial condition and
reputation (refer to point 3.2 of this chapter).

3.1.9 Countries targeted by economic sanctions

TOTAL has activities in certain countries targeted by economic
sanctions. If the Group’s activities are not conducted in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, TOTAL could
face penalties.

Economic sanctions or other restrictive measures could target
countries, such as Cuba, Iran, and Syria and/or target actors or
economic sectors, such as in Russia or in Venezuela.

U.S. and European restrictions relevant to the Group and certain
disclosure concerning the Group's limited activities or presence in
certain targeted countries are outlined in points 3.1.9.1 and 3.1.9.2,
respectively.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

3.1.9.1 U.S. and European legal restrictions

TOTAL closely monitors applicable international economic sanctions
regimes, including those adopted by the United States and the
European Union (“EU”) (collectively, “Sanctions Regimes”), changes
to such regimes and possible impacts on the Group's activities.
TOTAL takes steps to ensure compliance with applicable Sanctions
Regimes and believes that its current activities in targeted countries
do not infringe the applicable Sanctions Regimes. However, the
Group cannot assure that current or future regulations related to
Sanctions Regimes will not have a negative impact on its business,
financial condition or reputation. A violation by the Group of applicable
Sanctions Regimes could result in criminal, civil and/or material
financial penalties.

A) Restrictions against Cuba

U.S. sanctions against Cuba prohibit any person subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States" from engaging, directly or indirectly,
in any activities or dealings related to Cuba, without government
authorization. Therefore, the use of the U.S. dollar is prohibited for
almost all transactions related to Cuba. Furthermore, it is prohibited
to export and reexport to Cuba all goods subject to the Export
Administration Regulations® without a license and with exceptions
(for example, certain medical equipment), as well as to import all
goods of Cuban origin into the United States. Cuba is not subject to
European economic sanctions.

TOTAL has had an interest in a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder
filing plant in Cuba since 1997 and continues the development of its
activities regarding lubricants, fluids and greases in Cuba.

B) Restrictions against Iran

Several countries and international organizations, including the United
States and the EU, maintain Sanctions Regimes of varying degrees
targeting Iran.

On July 14, 2015, the EU, China, France, Russia, the United
Kingdom, the United States and Germany reached an agreement
with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the
“JCPOA"), regarding limits on Iran's nuclear activities and relief under
certain U.S., EU and UN economic sanctions regarding Iran.
On January 16, 2016, the International Atomic Energy Agency
(“IAEA”) confirmed that Iran had met its initial nuclear compliance
commitments under the JCPOA. Therefore, as from that date, UN
economic sanctions, most U.S. secondary sanctions (i.e., those
covering non-U.S. persons® and for activities outside U.S.
jurisdiction) and most EU economic sanctions were suspended “).

Following the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA in
May 2018, U.S. secondary sanctions concerning the oil industry
were re-imposed as of November 5, 2018.

In July 2017, TOTAL signed a contract for a period of 20 years with
the National Iranian Oil Company (“NIOC”) relating to the development
and production of phase 11 (SP11)® of the giant South Pars gas
field. Following the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA,
TOTAL withdrew from this project and finalized its withdrawal on
October 29, 2018, prior to the re-imposition of U.S. secondary
sanctions on the oil industry as of November 5, 2018. TOTAL ceased
all operational activity in Iran before November 4, 2018.

Furthermore, certain U.S. states have adopted regulations with
respect to Iran requiring, in certain conditions, state pension funds
and other state-owned institutional investors to divest securities in
any company that has or had business operations in Iran and state
public contracts not to be awarded to such companies. Certain U.S.
state regulators have adopted similar initiatives relating to investments
by insurance companies. TOTAL believes the impact of these
regulations to be limited due to the Group's decision to withdraw
from Iran. Nevertheless, TOTAL continues to closely monitor these
measures, which are generally still in effect following the withdrawal
of the United States from the JCPOA.

With respect to the Group's activities conducted under the sanctions
framework that was in place prior to the entry into force of the
JCPOA, the U.S. Department of State made a determination on
September 30, 2010 that certain historical activities would not be
deemed sanctionable and that, so long as TOTAL acted in
accordance with its commitments related to this determination, it
would not be regarded as a company of concern for its past
lran-related activities. TOTAL's historical activities in Iran have been
conducted in compliance with these Sanctions Regimes. Since 2011,
TOTAL has had no production in Iran.

Risk Factors

Refer to point 3.1.9.2 below for information concerning Section 13(r)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pertaining to
activities of the Group related to Iran.

C) Restrictions against Russia

Since July 2014, various Sanctions Regimes have been adopted
against Russia, including prohibitions to deal with certain Russian
individuals and entities or restrictions on financings, as well as
restrictions on investments and exports to Russia.

The economic sanctions adopted by the EU since 2014 do not
materially affect TOTAL's activities in Russia. TOTAL has been formally
authorized by the French government, which is the competent
authority for granting authorization under the EU sanctions regime,
to continue all its activities in Russia on the Kharyaga and
Termokarstovoye fields and the Yamal LNG and the Arctic 2 LNG
projects.

The United States adopted various economic sanctions, some of
which target PAO Novatek'® (“Novatek”), and the entities in which
Novatek (individually or with other similarly targeted persons or
entities) owns an interest of at least 50%, including OAO Yamal LNG”
(‘Yamal LNG"),Terneftegas® and OOO Arctic 2 LNG. These
sanctions prohibit, in particular, U.S. persons from all transactions in,
providing financing for, and other dealings in debt issued by these
entities after July 16, 2014 of longer than 90 days maturity (reduced
to 60 days as from the end of November 2017). The use of the U.S.
dollar is therefore prohibited for these types of financings, including
Yamal LNG. The Yamal LNG project's financing was finalized in
successive steps in 2016 in compliance with applicable regulations.
The financing of the Arctic LNG 2 project is under discussion.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed
restrictions on exports and reexports of certain goods to Russia
under the regulation related to the U.S. export control with respect to
certain oil projects, which do not materially impact TOTAL’s current
activities in Russia.

In August 2017, the United States adopted the Countering America’s
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (“CAATSA"). This law provides
for, in particular, the possibility to impose secondary sanctions against
anon-U.S. person who (i) invests in certain types of crude oil projects;
(ii) carries out a significant transaction with a sanctioned Russian
individual or entity; (iii) carries out a significant transaction with an
individual/entity party to or acting on behalf of Russian economic
intelligence or defense sectors; (iv) carries out a direct and significant
investment (beyond certain amounts), which contributes to the
development of Russian export pipelines or (v) sells, leases or
provides goods, services, technologies or information that could
directly and in a significant manner facilitate the maintenance or
expansion of the construction, modernization or repair of energy
export pipelines by Russia. This law also, on the one hand, reduced
the maturity periods of debts restricting the financing of certain entities
and, on the other hand, extended, as from January 29, 2018, the
prohibition applicable to certain entities to export goods and services
outside of Russia in support of exploration or production projects of
oil in deep water, beyond the Arctic offshore, or concerning shale
formations (shale oil).

On April 6, 2018, the American Department of Treasury's Office of
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for the first time designated and
registered certain Russian oligarchs and political figures, as well as
several entities owned by them, on the list of Specially Designated
Nationals and Blocked Persons List. Non-U.S. persons may now be
sanctioned under secondary sanctions for having carried out
significant transactions with the designated persons.

TOTAL continues its activities in Russia in compliance with applicable
sanctions regimes.

(8) "U.S. person” means any U.S. citizen and permanent resident alien wherever he/she is in the world, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the
United States, including foreign branches, or any person or entity located in the United States.

(4) Certain U.S, and EU human rights-related and terrorism-related sanctions remain in force.

(6) TOTAL was an operator of the SP'11 project and held 50.1% alongside the national Chinese company China National Petroleum Corporation ("CNPC’) (30%) and Petropars (19.9%), a

100% owned subsidiary of NIOC.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

As of December 31, 2018, TOTAL held 21% of its proved reserves in
Russia, where the Group had 14% of its combined oil and gas
production in 2018.

D) Restrictions against Syria

The EU adopted measures in 2011 regarding trade with and
investment in Syria that are applicable to European persons and to
entities constituted under the laws of an EU Member State, including,
notably, a prohibition on the purchase, import or transportation from
Syria of crude oil and petroleum products. The United States also
has adopted comprehensive measures that broadly prohibit trade
and investment in and with Syria. Since 2011, the Group ceased its
activities that contributed to oil and gas production in Syria and has
not purchased hydrocarbons from Syria since that time (refer to point
3.1.9.2).

E) Restrictions against Venezuela

Since 2014, different Sanctions Regimes were adopted relating to
Venezuela, including prohibitions to deal with certain Venezuelan
individuals and entities, as well as restrictions on financings.

In August 2017, the United States adopted economic sanctions
relating to the Government of Venezuela as well as certain
state-owned or controlled entities (collectively, the “Government of
Venezuela”), including Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PdVSA") as
well as entities in which PdVSA (individually or with other similarly
targeted persons or entities collectively) owns an interest of at least
50% (which includes Petrocedefo S.A., a company in which the
Group held an interest of 30.32% as of December 31, 2018). These
sanctions prohibit all U.S. persons" from transacting in, providing
financing for or otherwise dealing in debt issued by PdVSA as from
August 25, 2017 of longer than 90 days maturity. The use of the U.S.
dollar is therefore prohibited for these types of financings, including
with Petrocedefio S.A.

Since November 13, 2017, Venezuela has also been subject to
European sanctions, which mainly provide for the freezing of assets
of certain individuals and entities, a military embargo as well as
restrictions on the exportation of certain goods.

In May 2018, the United States adopted a new round of sanctions
against the Government of Venezuela, prohibiting all U.S. persons
from transacting in (i) the purchase of debts owed to the Government
of Venezuelan and (ii) the sale, transfer, assignment, or pledging as
collateral by the Government of Venezuelan of any equity interest in
any entity in which the Government of Venezuela has a 50% or
greater ownership interest.

On January 28, 2019, pursuant to Executive Order 13850, American
Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
designated and registered PdVSA on the list of Specially Designated
Nationals and Blocked Persons List, as well as any entities in which
PdVSA owns an interest of at least 50%, including Petrocederio S.A.

To date, TOTAL has organised the management of its interest to ensure
compliance with applicable sanctions.

3.1.9.2 Information concerning certain limited
activities in Iran and Syria

Information concerning TOTAL's activities related to Iran that took
place in 2018 provided in this section is disclosed according to
Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(“U.S. Exchange Act").

In addition, information for 2018 is provided concerning the payments
made by Group affiliates to, or additional cash flow that operations of
Group affiliates generate for, the government of any country identified
by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently, Iran,
North Korea, Syria and Sudan)" or any entity controlled by those
governments.

TOTAL believes that these activities are not sanctionable, including
for activities previously disclosed. For more information on certain
U.S. and EU restrictions relevant to TOTAL in these jurisdictions,
refer to point 3.1.9.1 of this chapter.

A) Iran

The Group's operational activities related to Iran were stopped in
2018 following the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA.
in May 2018 and prior to the re-imposition of U.S. secondary
sanctions on the oil industry as of November 5, 2018.

Statements in this section concerning affiliates intending or expecting
to continue activities described below are subject to such activities
continuing to be permissible under applicable international economic
sanctions regimes.

a) Exploration & Production

Following the suspension of certain international economic sanctions
against Iran on January 16, 2016, the Group commenced various
business development activities in Iran. Total E&P South Pars S.A.S.
(‘TEPSP”) (a wholly-owned affiliate), CNPC International Ltd.
(“CNPCI") (a wholly-owned affiliate of China National Petroleum
Company) and Petropars Ltd. (“Petropars”) (a wholly-owned affiliate
of NIOC) signed a 20-year risked service contract in July 2017, (the
“Risked Service Contract”) for the development and production of
phase 11 of the South Pars gas field (“SP11").TEPSP (50.1%) was
the operator and a partner of the project alongside CNPCI (30%)
and Petropars (19.9%). These companies entered into a joint
operating agreement in July 2017 (the “JOA") concerning, among
other things, the governance of their obligations under the Risked
Service Contract and the designation of TEPSP as the project's
operator.

In 2018, TEPSP continued conducting petroleum operations on
behalf of the above-mentioned consortium in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Risked Service Contract and the JOA. In
particular, TEPSP: (i) held several meetings with the Iranian authorities,
NIOC and other Iranian state owned/controlled entities; (ii) launched
tenders for award of service contracts for the purposes of the SP11
project; (iii) negotiated various agreements (such as service and/or
supply agreements and bank service agreements); and (iv) performed
other activities under the Risked Service Contract and the JOA.

In 2018, TEPSP completed the technical studies, which were started
in November 2016, in accordance with the technical services
agreement (the “TSA”) between NIOC and TEPSP, acting on behalf
of the consortium.

(1) “U.S. person” means any U.S. citizen and permanent resident alien wherever he/she is in the world, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the
United States, including foreign branches, or any person or entity located in the United States.

(2) In North Korea, other than fees related to trademarks and designs paid in 2018, TOTAL is not present. In this country. In Sudan, other than the payment of fees related to trademarks, the
Group is not aware of any of its activities in 2018 having resulted in payments to, or additional cash flow for, the government of that country.

However, as a result of the withdrawal of the U.S. from the JCPOA in
May 2018, TOTAL ceased all of its activities related to the SP11
project and finalized its withdrawal from the SP11 project on October
29, 2018, at which time it transferred its participating interest and
operatorship of the project to CNPCI.

The MOU entered into between TOTAL and NIOC in January 2016
to assess potential developments in Iran (including South Azadegan)
was amended to include North Azadegan and to extend its duration.
NIOC provided TOTAL in 2017 with technical data on the Azadegan
cil field so that it could assess potential development of this field.
Representatives of TOTAL held technical meetings in 2017 with
representatives of NIOC and its affiliated companies and carried out
a technical review of the Azadegan (South & North) oil field as well as
the Iran LNG Project (a project contemplating a 10 Mt/y LNG
production facility at Tombak Port on Iran's Persian Gulf coast), the
results of which were partially disclosed to NIOC and relevant affiliated
companies. In addition, TOTAL signed an MOU in 2017 with an
international company to evaluate jointly the Azadegan oil field
opportunity with NIOC. This international company decided in
February 2018 to withdraw from this technical cooperation and a
MOU termination agreement was formally executed with TOTAL on
May 16, 2018. Technical studies were pursued by TOTAL until March
2018 on the Azadegan area with regular contacts with NIOC.
All work and contacts with NIOC on this subject ceased at the end
of March 2018.

During 2018, in connection with the activities under the aforementioned
Risked Service Contract and MOUs, and to discuss other new
opportunities, representatives of TOTAL attended meetings with the
Iranian oil and gas ministry and several lranian companies with ties to
the government of Iran. In connection with travel to Iran in 2018 by
certain employees of the Group, TOTAL made payments to Iranian
authorities for visas, airport services, exit fees and similar travel-related
charges. In addition, representatives of TOTAL had meetings in
France with the Iranian ambassador.

Neither revenues nor profits were recognized from any of the
aforementioned activities under the aforementioned Risked Service
Contract and MOUs in 2018.

Maersk Oil studied two potential projects with NIOC, prior to the
acquisition of Maersk Oil by TOTAL in March 2018. These studies
ceased after a meeting with NIOC representatives in May 2018.

The Tehran branch office of TEPSP, opened in 2017 for the purposes
of the SP11 project, ceased all operational activities prior to
November 1, 2018 and will be closed and de-registered in 2019.
Since November 2018, Total Iran BV maintains a local representative
office in Tehran with a few employees, solely for non-operational
functions. Concerning payments to Iranian entities in 2018, Total Iran
BV and Elf Petroleum Iran collectively made payments of
approximately IRR 31.7 billion (approximately $300,000") to the
lranian administration for taxes and social security contributions
concerning the personnel of the aforementioned representative office
and residual obligations related to various prior risked service
contracts. In 2019, similar types of payments are to be made in
connection with maintaining the representative office in Tehran, albeit
in lower amounts. None of these payments has been or is expected
to be executed in U.S. dollars.

Furthermore, Total E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK"), a wholly-owned
affiliate, holds a 1% interest in a joint venture for the Bruce field in the
United Kingdom with Serica Energy (UK) Limited (“Serica”) (98%,
operator) and BP Exploration Operating Company Limited (“BP”)
(1%), following the completion of the sale of 42.25% of TEP UK's
interests in the Bruce field on November 30, 2018 pursuant to a sale
and purchase agreement dated August 2, 2018 between TEP UK
and Serica. Upon the closing of the transaction on November 30,
2018, all other prior joint venture partners also sold their interests in
the Bruce field to Serica (BP sold 36% retaining a 1% interest; BHP
Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Limited (“BHP”) sold their full 16%

interest and Marubeni Oil & Gas (U.K.) Limited ((“Marubeni”) sold
their full 3.75%).

The Bruce field joint venture is party to an agreement (the “Bruce
Rhum Agreement”) governing certain transportation, processing and
operation services provided to another joint venture at the Rhum
field in the UK, co-owned by Serica (60%, operator) and the Iranian
Oil Company UK Ltd (“IOC”), a subsidiary of NIOC (50%). Under the
terms of the Bruce Rhum Agreement, the Rhum field owners pay a
proportion of the operating costs of the Bruce field facilities calculated
on a gas throughput basis. IOC's share of costs incurred under the
Bruce Rhum Agreement have been paid to TEP UK in 2018 by
Naftiran Intertrade Company Limited (“NICO”), the trading branch of
the National Iranian Oil Company (“NIOC"). NIOC is the parent
company of IOC and an Iranian government owned corporation.
In 2018, based upon TEP UK's 1% interest in the Bruce field and
income from the net cash flow sharing arrangement with Serica,
gross revenue to TEP UK from IOC's share of the Rhum field resulting
from the Bruce Rhum Agreement was approximately £8 million. This
sum was used to offset operating costs on the Bruce field and as
such, generated no net profit to TEP UK. This arrangement is
expected to continue in 2019.

In 2018, TEP UK acted as agent for BHP and Marubeni, which faced
difficulty securing banking arrangements allowing them to accept
payments from IOC, and, thus, received payments from IOC in
relation to BHP and Marubeni’s share of income from the Bruce
Rhum Agreement under the terms of an agency agreement entered
into in June 2018 between BHP, Marubeni and TEP UK (the “Agency
Agreement”). Payments made from IOC to BHP and Marubeni in
2018 related to the periods prior to the completion of their divestment
to Serica in November 2018. Total payment received on behalf of
BHP and Marubeni by TEP UK under this arrangement in 2018 was
approximately £7 million. This amount relates to income due to BHP
and Marubeni under the Bruce Rhum Agreement for 2017 and 2018.
TEP UK transferred all income received under the Agency Agreement
to BHP and Marubeni and provided the service on a no profit, no
loss basis. The Agency Agreement is expected to be terminated
upon receipt of all payments relating to the period up to November
30, 2018.

Prior to the re-imposition of U.S. secondary sanctions on the oil
industry as of November 5, 2018, TEP UK liaised directly with IOC.
concerning its interest in the Bruce Rhum Agreement and it received
payments directly for services provided to IOC under the Bruce Rhum
Agreement. In October 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office
of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) granted a new conditional license
to BP and Serica authorizing the provision of services to the Rhum
field, following the reinstatement of U.S. secondary sanctions. The
principal condition of the OFAC license is that the Iranian
government's shareholding in IOC is transferred into a trust in order
that Iran may not derive any benefit from the Rhum field or exercise
any control while the U.S. secondary sanctions are in place. A Jersey
based trust has been put in place with the trustee holding IOC's
shares in the Rhum field. |OC’s interest is now managed by a new
independent management company established by the trust and
referred to as the “Rhum Management Company” (“RMC") and where
necessary TEP UK liaises, and expects to continue doing so in 2019,
with RMC in relation to the Bruce Rhum Agreement.

TEP UK is also party to an agreement with Serica whereby TEP UK
uses reasonable endeavors to evacuate Rhum NGL from the St
Fergus Terminal (the “Rhum NGL Agreement”). TEP UK provides this
service — subject to Serica having title to all of the Rhum NGL to be
evacuated and Serica having a valid license from OFAC for the
activity - on a cost basis, but for which TEP UK charges a monthly
handling fee that generates an income of approximately £35,000 per

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

Following the acquisition of Maersk Oil in 2018, the undeveloped
Yeoman discovery is now wholly owned by the Group, under license
P2158 granted to Maersk Oil North Sea UK Limited, recently renamed
Total E&P North Sea UK Limited (“TEPNSUK"). Yeoman is situated
adjacent to the Pardis discovery in which IOC held an interest, which
it sold in October 2018. Prior to this divestment, non-legally binding
technical and commercial discussions had taken place between
TEPNSUK, IOC and the UK Government's Oil and Gas Authority
during the first half of 2018 regarding a potential joint development of
Yeoman and Pardis but no contractual arrangements were
implemented in connection with such discussions. Also prior to this
divestement, other discussions had taken place between TEPNSUK
and IOC on an informal basis regarding a potential farm-in to Pardis
by Maersk Oil.

Lastly, TOTAL S.A. paid approximately €8,000 to Iranian authorities
related to various patents") in 2018. Similar payments are expected
to be made in 2019 for such patents.

b) Other business segments

In 2018, TOTAL S.A. paid fees of approximately € 1,500 to Iranian
authorities related to the maintenance and protection of trademarks
and designs in Iran. Similar payments are expected to be made in
2019.

Trading & Shipping

Following the suspension of applicable EU and U.S. economic
sanctions in 2016, the Group commenced the purchase of Iranian
hydrocarbons through its wholly-owned affiliate TOTSA TOTAL OIL.
TRADING SA (“TOTSA"). In 2018, the Group continued its trading
activities with Iran via TOTSA, which purchased approximately 18 Mb.
of Iranian crude oil for nearly €1 billion pursuant to term contracts.
It is not possible to estimate the gross revenue and net profit related
to these purchases because the totality of this crude oil was used to
supply the Group's refineries. In addition, in 2018, approximately
1 Mb of petroleum products were sold to entities with ties to the
government of Iran. These activities generated gross revenue of
nearly €43 million and a net profit of approximately €1 million. The
Group ceased these activities in June 2018.

Gas, Renewables & Power

Saft Groupe S.A. (“Saft”), a wholly-owned affiliate, in 2018 sold
signaling and backup battery systems for metros and railways as
well as products for the utilities and oil and gas sectors to companies
in Iran, including some having direct or indirect ties with the Iranian
government. In 2018, this activity generated gross revenue of
approximately €2.5 million and net profit of approximately
€0.3 million. Saft ceased this activity in 2018. Saft also attended the
lran Oil Show in 2018, where it discussed business opportunities
with Iranian customers, including those with direct or indirect ties
with the Iranian government. Saft ceased this activity in 2018.

Total Eren, a company in which Total Eren Holding holds an interest
of 68.76% (TOTAL S.A. owns 33.86% of Total Eren Holding), had
preliminary discussions during January to March 2018 for possible
investments in renewable energy projects in Iran, including meetings
with ministries of the Iranian government. These discussions and
meetings ceased as of March 2018 and neither revenues nor profits
were recognized from this activity in 2018.

Refining & Chemicals

As of May 2018, Hutchinson SA and its affiliates no longer accepted
orders from Iranian companies and ceased all activities, in general,
with Iran and all Iranian companies prior to August 6, 2018.

Le Joint Frangais, a wholly-owned affiliate of Hutchinson SA, sold
vehicular O-ring seals in 2018 to Iran Khodro, a company in which

the government of Iran holds a 20% interest and which is supervised
by Iran's Industrial Management Organization. This activity generated
gross revenue of approximately €54,056 and net profit of
approximately € 8,108.

Paulstra S.N.C., a wholly-owned affiliate of Hutchinson SA, obtained
in 2017 an order from Iran Khodro to sell vehicular anti-vibration
systems over a 5-year period. This activity did not generate any
gross revenue or net profit in 2018 because Paulstra did not delivery
any product to Iran Khodro. The order was terminated in 2018.
Paulstra S.N.C. also sold oil seals in 2018 to Iran Khodro. This activity
generated gross revenue of approximately € 1,078,887 and net profit
of approximately € 161,833.

Catelsa Caceres, a wholly-owned affiliate of Hutchinson Iberia, itself
wholly-owned by Hutchinson SA, sold sealing products to Iran
Khodro in 2018. This activity generated gross revenue of
approximately € 1,449 and net profit of approximately €217.

Hutchinson GMBH, a wholly-owned affiliate of Hutchinson SA, sold
hoses for automotive vehicles to Iran Khodro in 2018. This activity
generated gross revenue for approximately € 257,400 and net profit
of approximately € 38,610. The last shipments from Hutchinson and
its affiliates to Iran Khodro were in August 2018 and last payments
were made in October 2018.

Hanwha Total Petrochemicals (“HTC"), a joint venture in which Total
Holdings UK Limited (a wholly-owned affiliate) holds a 50% interest
and Hanwha General Chemicals holds a 50% interest, purchased
approximately 17 Mb of condensates from NIOC for approximately
KRW 1,310 billion (approximately $1.2 billion) from January to July
2018, then HTC stopped purchasing from NIOC. These condensates.
are used as raw material for certain of HTC's steam crackers. HTC
also chartered fifteen tankers of condensates with National Iranian
Tanker Company (NITC), a subsidiary of NIOC, for approximately
KRW 24 billion (approximately $22.3 million). In November 2018,
South Korea was granted a significant reduction exemption waiver
(the “SRE waiver") allowing it to import Iranian condensate from NIOC
for six months. For 2019, based on the SRE waiver, HTC is reviewing
the feasibility to resume purchases from NIOC.

Total Research & Technology Feluy (“TRTF”, a wholly-owned affiliate),
Total Marketing & Services (“TMS”, a wholly-owned affiliate), and
Total Raffinage Chimie (“TRC”) paid in 2018 fees totaling
approximately € 1,000 to Iranian authorities related to various patents.
Similar payments are expected to be made by TRTF and TRC in
2019. TMS abandoned its patent rights in Iran in 2018, thus no
payments are expected by TMS in 2019.

Marketing & Services

Until December 2012, at which time it sold its entire interest, the
Group held a 50% interest in the lubricants retail company Beh Tam
(formerly Beh Total) along with Behran Oil (50%), a company
controlled by entities with ties to the government of Iran. As part of
the sale of the Group's interest in Beh Tam, TOTAL S.A. agreed to
license the trademark “Total” to Beh Tam for an initial 3-year period
(renewed for an additional 3 year period) for the sale by Beh Tam of
lubricants to domestic consumers in Iran. Royalty payments for 2014
were received by TOTAL S.A. during the first semester of 2018 in the
amount of approximately € 730,000. There remain outstanding royalty
payments for 2015 through 2017 in favor of TOTAL S.A. This licensing
agreement was terminated in 2018. In addition, representatives of
Total Oil Asia-Pacific Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned affiliate, visited Behran
Oil beginning 2018 regarding the potential purchase of 50% of the
share capital of Beh Tam. Discussions on this matter ended following
the announcement of the re-imposition of U.S. secondary sanctions
‘on the oil industry.

(1) Section 560,509 of the U.S. Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations provides an authorization for certain transactions in connection with patent, trademark, copyright or other
intellectual property protection in the United States or Iran, including payments for such services and payments to persons in Iran directly connected to intellectual property rights, and
TOTAL believes that the activities related to the industrial property rights described in this point 3.1.9.2 are consistent with that authorization.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

Total Marketing Middle East FZE, a wholly-owned affiliate, sold
lubricants to Beh Tam in 2018. The sale in 2018 of approximately
43 t of lubricants and special fluids generated gross revenue of
approximately AED 500,000 (approximately $136,000) and net profit
of approximately AED 260,000 (approximately $71,000)". The
company stopped all transactions with this customer as of August
2018.

Total Marketing France (“TMF”), a company wholly-owned by TMS,
provided in 2018 fuel payment cards to the Iranian embassy and
delegation to UNESCO in France for use in the Group's service
stations. In 2018, these activities generated gross revenue of
approximately €32,000 and net profit of approximately €5,000.
The company expects to continue this activity in 2019.

TMF also sold jet fuel in 2018 to Iran Air as part of its airplane refueling
activities in France. The sale of approximately 260 cubic meters of jet
fuel generated gross revenue of approximately € 130,000 and net
profit of approximately €570. The company stopped all transactions
with this customer prior to November 5, 2018.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Legal and arbitration proceedings

Total Belgium, a wholly-owned affiliate, provided in 2018 fuel payment
cards to the Iranian embassy in Brussels (Belgium) for use in the
Group's service stations. In 2018, these activities generated gross
revenue of approximately €11,000 and net profit of approximately
€4,000. The company expects to continue this activity in 2019.

B) Syria

Since early December 2011, TOTAL has ceased its activities that
contribute to oil and gas production in Syria and maintains a local
office solely for non-operational functions. In late 2014, the Group
initiated a downsizing of its Damascus office and reduced its staff to
a few employees. In 2018, TOTAL paid approximately €84,000 to
the Syrian government as contributions for social security in relation
to the aforementioned personnel.

In addition, the Group paid fees related to various industrial property
rights (patents, trademarks and designs) in 2018.

3.2 Legal and arbitration proceedings

There are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, including
any proceeding of which the Company is aware that are pending or
threatened against the Company, that could have, or could have had
during the last 12 months, a material impact on the Group's financial
situation or profitability.

Described below are the main administrative, legal and arbitration
proceedings in which the Company and the other entities of the
Group are involved.

Alitalia

In the Marketing & Services segment, a civil proceeding was initiated
in Italy, in 2013, against TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiary Total Aviazione
Italia Srl before the competent Italian civil court. The plaintiff claims
against TOTAL S.A., its subsidiary and other third parties, damages
that it estimates to be nearly €908 million. This proceeding follows
practices that had been condemned by the Italian competition
authority in 2006. The parties have exchanged preliminary findings
and a request for an expert opinion has been approved by the court.
The existence and the assessment of the alleged damages in this
procedure involving multiple defendants remain contested.

FERC.

The Office of Enforcement of the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) began in 2015 an investigation in connection
with the natural gas trading activities in the United States of Total
Gas & Power North America, Inc. (TGPNA), a U.S. subsidiary of the
Group. The investigation covered transactions made by TGPNA
between June 2009 and June 2012 on the natural gas market.
TGPNA received a Notice of Alleged Violations from FERC on
September 21, 2015. On April 28, 2016, FERC issued an order to
show cause to TGPNA and two of its former employees, and to
TOTAL S.A. and Total Gas & Power Ltd., regarding the same facts.
TGPNA contests the claims brought against it. A class action,
launched to seek damages from these three companies, was
dismissed by a judgment of the U.S. District court of New York issued
on March 15, 2017. The Court of Appeal upheld this judgment on
May 4, 2018.

Grande Paroisse

On September 21, 2001, an explosion occurred at the industrial site
of Grande Paroisse (a former subsidiary of Atofina which became
a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine Fertilisants on December 31, 2004).
The explosion caused the death of 31 people, including 21 workers
at the site, injured many others and caused significant damage on
the site and to property in the city of Toulouse.

After many years, the investigating magistrate brought charges
against Grande Paroisse and the former Plant Manager before the
Toulouse Criminal Court. On November 19, 2009, this tribunal
acquitted both the former Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse due
to the lack of reliable evidence for the explosion. The Court declared
Grande Paroisse civilly liable for the damages caused by the explosion
to the victims in its capacity as custodian and operator of the plant.

On September 24, 2012, the Court of Appeal of Toulouse convicted
Grande Paroisse and the former Plant Manager.

On January 13, 2015, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation)
fully quashed the decision of September 24, 2012. The case was
referred back to the Court of Appeal of Paris, which, on October 31,
2017, convicted Grande Paroisse and the former Plant Manager.
Both have decided to appeal this decision before the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation).

A compensation mechanism for victims was set up immediately
following the explosion. €2.3 billion was paid for the compensation
of claims and related expenses amounts. A €10 million reserve
remains booked in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements
as of December 31, 2018.

Iran

In 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed
by the Department of Justice (DoJ) issued a formal order directing an
investigation against TOTAL, and other oil companies, for alleged
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the
Company's accounting obligations in connection with the pursuit of
business in Iran in the 1990s.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Internal control and risk management procedures

In late May 2013, and after several years of discussions, TOTAL
reached settlements with the U.S. authorities (a Deferred Prosecution
Agreement with the DoJ and a Cease and Desist Order with the
SEC). These settlements, which put an end to these investigations,
were concluded without admission of guilt and in exchange for TOTAL
respecting a number of obligations, including the payment of a fine
and civil compensation for an aggregate amount of $398.2 million.
By virtue of these settlements, TOTAL also accepted the appointment
of an independent compliance monitor to review the Group's
compliance program and to recommend possible improvements.

In July 2016, the monitor submitted his third and final report, in which
he certified that TOTAL had devised and implemented an appropriate
compliance program. As a result of this certification, the U.S.
authorities, after having reviewed the monitor's report, concluded
that TOTAL had fulfilled all of its obligations, thus bringing an end to
the monitoring process. As a result, a Court in the State of Virginia
granted a motion to dismiss on November 9, 2016, thereby
terminating the procedure directed at the Company, which can no
longer be pursued in the United States for these same facts.

With respect to the same facts, TOTAL was placed under formal
investigation in France in 2012. In October 2014, the investigating
magistrate decided to refer the case to trial. Pursuant to a judgment
issued on December 21, 2018, the Paris Criminal Court convicted
TOTAL of corruption of foreign official and ordered the Company to
pay a €500,000 fine. Given the specific circumstances of this case,
which has been already judged in the U.S. and in which none of the

3.3
procedures

The following information was prepared with the support of several
functional divisions of the Company, and in particular the Audit &

individuals can defend themselves, TOTAL did not want to pursue
the case. This decision is thus definitive.

Italy

As part of an investigation led by the Public Prosecutor of the Potenza
Court in 2007, Total Italia and also certain Group employees were
the subjects of an investigation related to alleged irregularities in
connection with the purchase of lands and the award of calls for
tenders in relation to the preparation and development of an oil field
located in the south of Italy.

Pursuant to a judgment issued on April 4, 2016, the Potenza Criminal
Court found four employees to be guilty of corruption, with two of
these employees also being found guilty of misappropriation in
connection with the purchase of land. The procedure with respect to
Total Italia was sent back to the public prosecutor due to the
imprecision of the terms of prosecution. The four employees decided
to challenge the judgment before the Court of Appeal.

Pursuant to a definitive judgment issued on February 20, 2018 the
Court of Appeal of Potenza recorded the termination of the
proceedings directed towards the four employees prosecuted for
corruption because of the expiration of the statute of limitation.

Pursuant to a judgment issued on July 17, 2018, the Court of Appeal
of Potenza acquitted two of the Group’s employees prosecuted for
misappropriation. The public prosecutor and a civil party (plaintiff)
have decided to appeal this decision.

Internal control and risk management

Internal Control, Legal and Finance Divisions. It was examined by the
Audit Committee, then approved by the Board of Directors.

3.3.1 Fundamental elements of the internal control and risk management

systems

The Group is structured around its business segments, to which the
Group's operational entities report. The business segments’
management are responsible, within their area of responsibility, for
ensuring that operations are carried out in accordance with the
strategic objectives defined by the Board of Directors and General
Management. The functional divisions at the Holding level help
General Management define norms and standards, oversee their
application and monitor activities. They also lend their expertise to
the operational divisions.

The Group's internal control and risk management systems are
structured around a three-level organization — Holding level, business
segments, operational entities - where each level is directly involved
and accountable in line with the level of delegation determined by
General Management.

General Management constantly strives to maintain an efficient
internal control system, based on the framework of the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In this framework, internal control is a process intended to provide
reasonable assurance that the objectives related to operations,
reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations are
achieved. As for any internal control system, it cannot provide an
absolute guarantee that all risks are completely controlled or
eliminated.

The COSO framework is considered equivalent to the reference
framework of the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des
marchés financiers). The Group has also chosen to rely on this
framework as part of its obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

The Group's internal control and risk management systems are
therefore based on the five components of this framework: control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, monitoring, and
information and communication.

The Group's risk management system draws on the main international
standards (COSO Enterprise Risk Management integrated framework,
ISO 31000: 2018 — Risk management) as well as on French
standards (Reference framework of the French Financial Markets
Authority). The internal Risk Management, Internal Control and Audit
Charter forms the common framework on which the Group relies to
ensure control of its activities.

The Group's internal control and risk management systems cover
the processes of the fully consolidated entities. Regarding
acquisitions, the Group’s control environment is implemented in the
acquired entities after a critical analysis of their own systems.

The principles of control fit into the framework of the rules of corporate
governance. In particular, these rules task the Board of Directors’
Audit Committee with monitoring the efficiency of the internal control
and risk management systems, and of the internal audit performed
to assess the risk management systems at all levels of the
organization and make recommendations for their improvement. The
Audit Committee also monitors the process of producing accounting
and financial information, in order to guarantee its integrity.

Approximately 400 employees monitor the internal control systems
within the Group. The assessment of the internal control and risk
management system is mainly overseen by the Audit & Internal
Control Division.


--- Page 84 ---

3.3.2 Control environment

Integrity and ethics - Framework

TOTAL's control environment is based primarily on its Code of
Conduct, which spells out the Group's values, two of which are core
values: Safety and Respect for Each Other, the latter being reflected
in the areas of integrity (fraud and corruption), respect for human
rights as well as environment and health. The principles of the Code
of Conduct are set forth in a number of guides, such as the Business
Integrity Guide and the Human Rights Guide. These documents are
distributed to employees and are available on the intranet. They also
set out the rules of individual behavior expected of all employees in
the countries where the Group is present. Similarly, a Financial Code
of Ethics sets forth the obligations applicable to the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President
of the Corporate Accounting Division and the financial and accounting
officers of the principal Group activities.

As a priority of General Management, the Group deploys an integrity
policy and compliance programs, in particular for the prevention of
corruption, fraud and competition law infringement. These programs.
include reporting and control actions (review and audit missions).
Ethical assessments are also conducted (refer to point 5.7 of chapter
5). In these areas, the Group relies on the Compliance network, the
Ethics officers’ network and the Ethics Committee, the role of which
is to listen and provide assistance.

TOTAL has a framework of Group standards that is completed by a
series of practical recommendations and feedback. Like the Group's
organization, this framework has a three-level structure: a Group
level, frameworks for each business segment, and a specific
framework for each significant operational entity.

Governance, authorities and responsibilities

The Board of Directors, with the support of its Committees, ensures
that the internal control functions are operating properly. The Audit
Committee ensures that General Management implements internal
control and risk management procedures based on the risks
identified, such that the Group's objectives are achieved.

General Management ensures that the organizational structure and
reporting lines plan, execute, control and periodically assess the
Group's activities. It regularly reviews the relevance of the
organizational structures so as to be able to adapt them quickly to
changes in the activities and in the environment in which they are
carried out.

The business segments and operational entities’ General
management are responsible for the internal control and risk
management system within their scope of responsibility.

The Group has also defined central responsibilities that cover the
three lines of internal control: (1) operational management, which is
responsible for implementing internal control, (2) support functions
(such as Finance, Legal, Human Resources, etc.), which prescribe
the internal control systems, verify their implementation and
effectiveness and assist operational employees, and (3) internal
auditors who, through their internal control reports, provide
recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the system.

An accountability system is defined and formalized at all levels of the
organization, through organization notes, organization charts,
appointment notes, job descriptions and delegations of powers. Each
business segment has established, in accordance with the Group's
instructions, clear rules applicable to its own scope.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Internal control and risk management procedures

The Group's Audit & Internal Control Division pursues a continual
process aimed at strengthening the assessment of the role and
involvement of all employees in terms of internal control. Training
initiatives tailored to the various stakeholders involved in the internal
control process are regularly launched within the Group.

Control activities and assessment

Any activity, process or management system may be the subject of
an internal audit conducted by Group Audit, in accordance with the
international internal audit framework of internal audits and its Code
of Conduct. The Group’s Audit & Internal Control Division also
conducts joint audits with third parties and provides assistance
(advice, analysis, input regarding methodology). The audit plan, which
is based on an analysis of the risks and risk management systems, is
submitted annually to the Executive Committee and the Audit
Committee. The Group's Audit & Internal Control Division employs
75 people and conducted about 150 internal audit missions in 2018.

The Group regularly examines and assesses the design and
effectiveness of the key operational, financial and information
technology controls related to internal control over financial reporting,
in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In 2018, this assessment
was performed with the assistance of the Group's main entities and
Audit & Internal Control Division. The system covers:

— the most significant entities, which assess the key operational
controls of their significant processes and respond to a Group
questionnaire for assessing the internal control framework; and

— other less significant entities, which respond only to the Group
questionnaire for assessing the internal control system.

These two categories of entities, which include the central functions
of the business segments and the corporate, account for
approximately 80% and 10%, respectively, of the financial aggregates
in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Direct Energie, Quadran and Global LNG, entities acquired in 2018,
are excluded from the scope of the assessment and conclusion on
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. These
three entities represented respectively 1.34%, 0.50% and 2.15% of
the Group's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and
0.34%, 0.04% and 0.07% of the Group's 2018 consolidated sales.

The statutory auditors also review the internal controls that they deem
necessary as part of their certification of the financial statements.
Pursuant to American regulations, they reviewed in 2018 the
implementation of the Group's internal control framework and the
design and effectiveness of key internal controls in its main entities
regarding financial reporting. Based on their review, the statutory
auditors stated that they had no remarks on the information presented
on internal control and risk management procedures.

The reports on the work performed by the Group Audit and statutory
auditors are periodically summarized and presented to the Audit
Committee and, thereby, to the Board of Directors. The Senior Vice
President, Audit & Internal Control attended all Audit Committee
meetings held in 2018. The Audit Committee also meets with the
statutory auditors at least once a year without any Company
representatives present.

If areas of improvement are identified by these internal audits and
operational controls, then corrective action plans are drawn up and
shared with operational management, who, along with the Group's
Audit & Internal Control Division, monitor their implementation closely.

Based on the internal reviews, General Management has reasonable
assurance of the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Internal control and risk management procedures

3.3.3. Risk assessment and management

3.3.3.1 General principles

To implement its strategy, General Management ensures that clear
and precise objectives are defined at the various levels of the
organization with regard to operations, reporting and compliance.

Operational objectives focus on the definition and efficient use of
human, financial and technical resources. In particular, they are
defined during the budgetary processes and in the long-term plan,
and are regularly monitored as part of the self-assessment process.

The monitoring of operational objectives (financial and non-financial)
helps in decision-making and monitoring the performance of activities
at each level of the organization.

The Group implements a risk-management system that is an essential
factor in the deployment of its strategy, based on responsible
risk-taking.

This system relies on a continuous process of identifying and
analyzing risks in order to determine those that could prevent the
achievment of TOTAL's goals.

The Executive Committee, with the assistance of the Group Risk
Management Committee (GRMC), is responsible for identifying and
analyzing internal and external risks that could impact the
achievement of the Group's objectives. The main responsibilities of
the GRMC include ensuring that the Group has a map of the risks to
which it is exposed and that suitable risk management systems are
in place. The GRMC's work focuses on continuously improving risk
awareness and the risk management systems.

Risk mapping, which has been carried out since the 2000s, is a
dynamic process that has taken shape over the years. The Group's
risk map feeds the audit plan, which is based on an analysis of the
risks and the risk management systems, and the work of the GRMC.

The GRMC relies on the work carried out by the business segments.
and functional divisions, which concurrently establish their own risk
mapping. The business segments are responsible for defining and
implementing a risk management policy suited to their specific
activities. However, the handling of certain transverse risks is more
closely coordinated by the respective functional divisions.

Regarding commitments, General Management exercises operational
control over TOTAL's activities through the Executive Committee's
approval of investments and expenses that exceed defined
thresholds. The Risk Committee (CORISK) is tasked with reviewing
these projects in advance, and in particular, with verifying the analysis
of the various associated risks.

3.3.3.2 Implementation of the organizational
framework

The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC)

The GRMC is chaired by a member of the Executive Committee, the
Group's Chief Financial Officer, and includes the Senior Vice
Presidents of the corporate functions, together with the chief
administrative officers or chief financial officers of the business
segments. The Group's Chief Financial Officer attends all meetings
of the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee, thus strengthening the
link between the GRMC and the Audit Committee.

The GRMC meets six times a year. At each meeting, the participants
share any potential risks they have identified and presentations are
given on one or more risk-related topics, during which the members
of the GRMC are invited to cast a critical eye over the subject,
question the work done and, if applicable, provide additional
information or clarification in order to enhance the understanding of
the risk and improve the risk management systems. The GRMC can
request that actions be taken.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

The work of the GRMC is led by the Audit & Internal Control Division,
which assists contributors in preparing the presentations and acts as
the committee's secretary. In this capacity, the Audit & Internal Control
Division reports regularly on the work of the GRMC to the Executive
Committee, and once a year to the Audit Committee in the presence
of the Group's Chief Financial Officer who chairs the GRMC.

The Risk Committee (CORISK)

The Risk Committee is chaired by a member of the Executive
Committee (Senior Vice President of Strategy & Innovation or Chief
Financial Officer). It is made up of representatives from the corporate
Strategy & Climate, Finance, Legal, Insurance and HSE divisions.

The Risk Committee meets on the same schedule as the Executive
Committee. Any project submitted to the Executive Committee (and
therefore giving rise to a financial commitment that exceeds certain
thresholds) is first presented to the Risk Committee by the relevant
operational division.

Following the review by the Risk Committee of the risks associated
with the project submitted, the Strategy & Climate Division sends the
Executive Committee a memorandum stating its opinion in light of
the Risk Committee's comments.

The Audit & Internal Control Division

The Risk Team of the Audit & Internal Control Division is responsible
for producing and continuously updating the Group's risk map.
To this end, it uses all of the risk-mapping work carried out across

resulting from this work and the monitoring of their implementation,
structured feedback, benchmarks and other external information
sources, regular interviews with the Group's executive officers, and
all information gathered during GRMC meetings and the preparation
for these meetings.

The Audit & Internal Control Division reports regularly on its work
related to the Group's risk map to the Executive Committee, which
are presented annually to the Audit Committee.

3.3.3.3. Systems in place

Risk management systems are implemented in the operational and
financial fields as well as in information systems and protection of
intellectual assets. Specific systems are deployed to prevent risks
related to ethics and non-compliance. The main risk management
systems covering health, safety, industrial security, the environment
and the prevention of corruption are presented in the statement of
non-financial performance (chapter 5).

Financial risks

The management and conditions of use of financial instruments are
governed by strict rules that are defined by the Group's General
Management, and which provide for centralization by the Treasury
Division of liquidity, interest and exchange rate positions, management
of financial instruments and access to capital markets. The Group's
financing policy consists of incurring long-term debt at a floating rate
or at a fixed rate, depending on the Group's general corporate needs,
and interest rates. Debt is incurred mainly in dollars or euros.

The Group's cash balances, which mainly consist of dollars and
euros, are managed to maintain liquidity based on daily interest rates
in the given currency. Maximum amounts are set for transactions
exceeding one month, with placements not to exceed 12 months.
TOTAL S.A. also has committed credit facilities granted by international
banks. These credit facilities, along with the Group's net cash position,
allow it to continually maintain a high level of liquidity in accordance
with targets set by General Management.


--- Page 86 ---

In terms of counterparty risk in financial transactions, the Group
adheres to a cautious policy, and only makes commitments with
institutions featuring a high degree of financial soundness, as based
on a multi-criteria analysis. An overall credit limit is set for each
authorized financial counterparty and allocated among the subsidiaries
and the Group's central treasury entities according to their needs. In
addition, to reduce market value risk on its commitments, the
Treasury Division has entered into margin call contracts with its
counterparties. In addition, since December 21, 2018, pursuant to
Regulation (EU) No. 648/2012 on OTC derivatives, central
counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR), some of the interest
rate swaps entered into by the Group are now being centrally cleared.

The Group seeks to minimize its currency exposure, on the one
hand, by financing its long-term assets in the functional currency of
the entity to which they belong and, on the other hand, by
systematically hedging the currency exposure generated by
commercial activity. These risks are managed centrally by the Treasury
Division, which operates within a set of limits defined by General
Management.

The policy for managing risks related to financing and cash
management activities, as well as the Group's currency exposure
and interest rate risks, are described in detail in Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements (point 8.7 of chapter 8).

Risks related to information systems

In order to maintain information systems that are appropriate to the
organization's needs and limit the risks associated with information
systems and their data, TOTAL’s IT Division has developed and
distributed governance and security rules that describe the
recommended infrastructure, organization and procedures. These
rules are implemented across the Group under the responsibility of
the various business segments. To address cyber threats, the Group.
conducts specific risk analyses permitting to define and put in place
appropriate security controls concerning information systems.

The Group has also developed control activities at various levels of
the organization relating to areas where information systems cover
all or part of the processes. Information Technology General Controls
aim to guarantee that information systems function and are available
as required, and that data integrity and confidentiality are also ensured
and changes controlled.

Information Technology Automated Controls aim to ensure the
integrity and confidentiality of data generated or supported by
business applications, particularly those that impact financial flows.

The outsourcing of some components of the Group's IT infrastructure
to service providers poses specific risks and requires the selection
and development of additional controls of the completeness,
accuracy and validity of the information supplied and received from
such service providers. Accordingly, to ensure continuous
improvement, the Group assesses whether suitable controls are
implemented by the service providers concerned and identifies the
controls necessary within its own organization to maintain these risks
at an acceptable level.

Furthermore, faced with rising legal and security-related risks, the
Group deploys policies to retain documents and to protect personal
data and the security of its information assets. The Group has also
employed an Operational Security Center to detect and analyze IT
system security events.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Internal control and risk management procedures

Ethical misconduct and non-compliance risks
Fraud prevention

The Group deploys an anti-fraud and fraud-prevention program and
has implemented a range of procedures and programs that help to
prevent and detect different types of fraud. This effort is supported
by the business principles and values of individual behavior described
in the Group’s Code of Conduct and other standards applied by the
Group's business segments.

The Group has issued a directive for handling incidents of fraud that
has been widely distributed to employees, and has created an alert
system that employees can use to report acts including those that
may constitute fraud.

An anti-fraud compliance program has been deployed since 2015,
including e-learning modules for all Group employees, a Guide to the
“Prevention and the fight against fraud”, a map of the risks of fraud in
the Group, a guide to the types of risk of fraud that includes descriptions
of the main risks and was published in 2016, and campaigns to raise
awareness of the major risks of fraud, launched at the end of 2016
and 2018. This program is deployed by the network of fraud risk
coordinators in the business segments and operational entities.
The role of coordinator is usually performed by the Compliance
Officer. Fraud risk analyses are also carried out in the subsidiaries.

For information on prevention of corruption, refer to point 5.8.1 of
chapter 5.

Prevention of competition law infringement

A Group policy aimed at ensuring compliance with, and preventing
infringement of, competition law has been in place since 2014 and is
a follow-up to the various measures previously implemented by the
business segments. Its deployment is based, in particular, on
management and staff involvement, training courses that include an
e-learning module, and an appropriate organization.

Prevention of conflicts of interest and market abuse

To prevent conflicts of interest, each of the Group’s senior executives
completes an annual statement declaring any conflicts of interest to
which they may be subject. By completing this declaration, each
senior executive also agrees to report to their supervisor any conflict
of interest that he or she has had, or of which he or she is aware in
performing his or her duties. An internal rule named “Conflicts of
Interests” reminds all employees of their obligation to report to their
supervisor any situation that might give rise to a conflict of interests.

The Group implements a policy to prevent market abuse linked to
trading on the financial markets that is based, in particular, on internal
ethics rules that are updated on a regular basis and distributed.
In addition, the Group's senior executives and certain employees, in
light of their positions, are asked to refrain from carrying out any
transactions, including hedging transactions, on TOTAL shares or
ADRs and in collective investment plans (FCPE) invested primarily in
TOTAL shares (as well as derivatives related to such shares) on the
day on which the Company discloses its periodic results publications
(quarterly, interim and annual), as well as during the 30 calendar-day
period preceding such date. An annual campaign specifies the
applicable blackout periods.

Prevention of risks of non-compliance with international
economic sanctions regimes

The Group's activities in relation to sanctioned countries (refer to
point 3.1.9 of this chapter) are subject to an analysis of compliance
with the various applicable economic sanctions regimes. With respect
to Iran and until the withdrawal of the Group's business operations
from this country on October 29, 2018, a specific compliance
program was put in place. In-depth investigations, carried out by
specialized service providers, were conducted on the Group's
stakeholders in Iran, in order to identify possible links with companies
or persons listed under international sanctions (Specially Designated

transactions related to Iran. An Iran compliance coordinator,
appointed in 2016, liaised with the compliance teams of the relevant
business segments and the Holding in order to ensure compliance
of the Group's activities with applicable laws and regulations.

Risks related to the protection of intellectual assets

To mitigate the risks of third parties infringing its intellectual property
and the leak of know-how, TOTAL protects its rights under research
partnership agreements negotiated by the Group's intellectual
property specialists, the terms and conditions of which are consistent

with the Group's industrial and commercial strategy. The Group has
a policy of filing and maintaining patents, it monitors technological
developments in terms of freedom of use, and it takes, when
necessary, all appropriate measures to ensure the protection of its
rights.

In addition, since some of its employees have access to confidential
documents while performing their duties, TOTAL has adopted internal
rules concerning the management of confidential information.
The Group's intellectual property specialists also carry out
awareness-raising activities with Group employees, so that they are
better informed about restrictions that may apply to the use of
information and data.

3.3.4 Main characteristics of the internal control and risk management
procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and

financial information

Accounting and financial internal control covers the processes that
produce accounting and financial data, and mainly the financial
statements processes and the processes to produce and publish
accounting and financial information. The internal control system
aims to:

— _ conserve the Group's assets;

— comply with accounting regulations, and properly apply standards
and methods to the production of financial information; and

— guarantee the reliability of accounting and financial information
by controlling the production of accounting and _ financial
information and its consistency with the information used to
produce the control panels at every appropriate level of the
organization.

At Group level, the Finance Division, which includes the Accounting
Division, the Budget & Financial Control Division and the Tax Division,
is responsible for the production and processing of accounting and
financial information. The scope of the internal control procedures
relating to the production and processing of financial and accounting
information includes the parent company (TOTAL S.A.), and all fully
consolidated entities or entities whose assets are under joint control.

Refer to point 4.1.2.3 of chapter 4 for a description of the role and
the missions of the Audit Committee. These missions are defined by
Directive 2014/56/EU and regulation (EU) n° 537/2014 pertaining to
the legal control of accounts.

3.3.4.1 Production of accounting and financial
information

Organization of the Financial and Information Systems function

Dedicated teams implement the accounting and financial processes
in the areas of consolidation, tax, budget and management control,
financing, cash positions and information systems. The entities,
business segments and General Management are respectively
responsible for accounting activities.

The Accounting Division, which is part of the Finance Division, is
responsible for drawing up the Consolidated Financial Statements
and manages the Group's network of accounting teams.

The tax function, made up of a network of tax experts in the Holding,
the business segments and the entities, monitors changes in local
and international rules. It oversees the implementation of the Group's
tax policy.

Management control contributes to the reinforcement of the internal
control system at every level of the organization. The network of
management controllers in the entities and the business segments is

supervised by the Budget & Financial Control Division. This
department also produces the monthly control panel, the budget
and the long-term plan for the Group.

The Treasury Division implements the financial policy, and in particular
the processing and centralization of cash flows, the debt and liquidity
investment policy and the coverage of currency exposure and interest
rate risks.

The Information Systems Division makes decisions on the choice of
software suited to the Group's accounting and financial requirements.
These information systems are subject to works to reinforce the task
separation system and to improve the control of access rights. Tools
are available to make sure that access rights comply with the Group's
rules in this area.

Consolidated Financial Statements process

The Accounting Division, which reports to the Finance Division,
prepares the Group's quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements
according to IFRS standards, on the basis of the consolidated
reporting packages prepared by the entities concerned.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are examined by the Audit
Committee, then approved by the Board of Directors.

The main factors in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements are as follows:

— the processes feeding the individual accounts used to prepare
the reporting packages for consolidation purposes are subject
to validation, authorization and booking rules;

— the consistency and reliability of the accounting and control data
are validated for each consolidated entity and at each appropriate
level of the organization;

— a consolidation tool, supervised by the Accounting Division, is
used by each consolidated entity and the Group. It guarantees
the consistency and reliability of the data at each appropriate
level of the organization;

— aconsolidation reporting package from each entity concerned is
sent directly to the Accounting Division. It is used to optimize the
transmission and the completeness of the information;

— acorpus of accounting rules and methods is formally defined.
Its application is compulsory for all the consolidated entities
in order to provide uniform and reliable financial information. This
framework is built according to IFRS accounting standards. The
Accounting Division centrally distributes this framework through
regular and formal communication with the business segment
managers, formal procedures and a Financial Reporting Manual
that is regularly updated. In particular, it specifies the procedures

(1) “U.S. person” means any U.S. citizen and permanent resident alien wherever he/she is in the world, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the
United States, including foreign branches, or any person or entity located in the United States.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

for the booking, identification and valuation of off-balance sheet
commitments;

— new accounting standards under preparation and changes to
the existing framework are monitored in order to assess and
anticipate their impacts on the Consolidated Financial
Statements;

— _ an accounts plan used by all the consolidated entities is formally
set forth in the Financial Reporting Manual, specifying the content
of each account and the procedures for the preparation of the
reporting packages for consolidation purposes;

— the account closing process is supervised and is based mainly
on the formalization of economic assumptions, judgments and
estimates, treatment of complex accounting transactions and
compliance with established timetables announced through
Group instructions disclosed to each entity;

— in particular, the process applicable to the preparation of the
accounts of the acquired entities are reviewed and, where
appropriate, amended to integrate them into those applicable to
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Furthermore, the booking in the accounts of the purchase price
allocation of each of these entities is based on assumptions,
estimates and judgments in line with the Group's business model;

— off-balance sheet commitments, which are valued according to
the Financial Reporting Manual are reported on a quarterly basis
to the Audit Committee.

Processing of accounting and financial information

Internal control of accounting information is mainly focused around
the following areas:

— amonthly financial report is formalized by Group and business
segment control panels. This report and the Consolidated
Financial Statements use the same framework and standards. In
addition, the quarterly closing schedule is the same for preparing
the Consolidated Financial Statements and financial reporting;

— a detailed analysis of differences as part of the quarterly
reconciliation between the Consolidated Financial Statements
and financial reporting is supervised by the Accounting and
Budget & Financial Control Divisions, which are part of the
Finance Division;

— a detailed analysis of differences between actual amounts and
the yearly budget established on a monthly basis is conducted
at each level of the organization. The various monthly indicators
are used to continually and uniformly monitor the performances
of each of the entities, business segments and of the Group,
and to make sure that they are in keeping with the objectives;

— _ an annual reconciliation between the parent company financial
statements and the financial statements based on IFRS
standards is performed by entity;

— periodic controls are designed to ensure the reliability of
accounting information and mainly concern the processes for
preparing aggregated financial items;

— a regular process for the signature of representation letters is
deployed at each level of the organization;

— _ an annual control system of the accounts of equity affiliates
based on a questionnaire completed by each entity concerned.
This system is integrated into the Group's internal control
framework; and

— the Disclosure Committee (CCIP) ensures the respect of the
procedures in place.

Other significant financial information is produced according to strict
internal control procedures.

Proved oil and gas reserves are evaluated annually by the relevant
entities. They are reviewed by the Reserves Committees, approved

RISKS AND CONTROL

Internal control and risk management procedures

by Exploration & Production’s general management and then
validated by the Group's General Management. They are also
presented to the Audit Committee each year.

The internal control process related to estimating reserves is
formalized in a special procedure described in detail in point 2.1.3 of
chapter 2. The reserves evaluation and the related internal control
processes are audited periodically.

The strategic outlook published by the Group is prepared, in
particular, according to the long-term plans drawn up at the business.
segment and Group levels, and on the work carried out at each
relevant level of the organization. The Board of Directors reviews the
‘strategic outlook each year.

3.3.4.2 Publication of accounting and financial
information

Significant information about the Group is published externally
according to formal internal procedures. These procedures aim to
guarantee the quality and fair presentation of the information intended
for the financial markets, and its timely publication.

The Disclosure Committee (CCIP), chaired by the Chief Financial
Officer, ensures, in particular, the respect of these procedures.
It meets before TOTAL’s financial results press releases, strategic
presentations and annual reports are submitted to the Audit
Committee and the Board of Directors.

A calendar of the publication of financial information is published and
made available to investors on the Group's web site (refer to point
6.6 of chapter 6). With the help of the Legal Division, Investor
Relations ensures that all publications are made on time and in
accordance with the principle of equal access to information between
shareholders.

Assessment of the system for the internal control of accounting
and financial information

The Group's General Management is responsible for implementing
and assessing the internal control system for financial and accounting
disclosure. In this context, the implementation of the Group's internal
control framework, based on the various components of the COSO
framework, is assessed internally at regular intervals within the
Group's main entities.

Pursuant to the requirements introduced by Section 302 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company have conducted, with the
assistance of members of certain divisions of the Group (in particular
Legal, Audit & Internal Control and Corporate Communications), an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal disclosure controls and
procedures, over the period covered by the annual report on Form
20-F. For fiscal year 2018, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls
and procedures were effective.

In addition, a specific process is in place for reporting any information
related to the Group's accounting procedures, internal control and
auditing. This process is available to any shareholder, employee or
third party.

Finally, the Consolidated Financial Statements undergo a limited
examination by external auditors during quarterly closing, and an
audit during annual closing. Almost all the audit missions in the
countries are fulfilled by the members of the networks of the two
statutory auditors, who, after having jointly examined all the accounts
and the procedures used to produce them, proceed with the annual
certification of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. They
are informed in advance of the process for the preparation of the
accounts and present a summary of their work to the Group
accounting and financial managers and to the Audit Committee
during the quarterly reviews and annual closing. The statutory auditors
also perform those internal control audits that they deem necessary
as part of their mission to certify the Financial Statements.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Insurance and risk management

3.4 Insurance and risk management

3.4.1 Organization

TOTAL has its own reinsurance company, Omnium Reinsurance
Company (ORC). ORC is integrated within the Group's insurance
management and is used as a centralized global operations tool for
covering the Group companies’ insurable risks. It allows the Group's
worldwide insurance program to be implemented in compliance with
the specific requirements of local regulations applicable in the
countries where the Group operates.

Some countries may require the purchase of insurance from a local
insurance company. If the local insurer agrees to cover the subsidiary
of the Group in compliance with its worldwide insurance program,
ORC negotiates a retrocession of the covered risks from the local
insurer. As a result, ORC enters into reinsurance contracts with the
subsidiaries’ local insurance companies, which transfer most of the
risk to ORC.

At the same time, ORC negotiates a reinsurance program at the
Group level with oil industry mutual insurance companies and
commercial reinsurance markets. ORC allows the Group to better
manage price variations in the insurance market by taking on a
greater or lesser amount of risk corresponding to the price trends in
the insurance market.

In 2018, the net amount of risk retained by ORC after reinsurance
was, on the one hand, a maximum of $100 million per onshore or
offshore third-party liability insurance claim and, on the other hand,
$125 million per property damage and/or business interruption
insurance claim. Accordingly, in the event of any loss giving rise to an
aggregate insurance claim, the effect on ORC would be limited to its
maximum retention of $225 million per occurrence.

3.4.2 Risk and insurance management policy

In this context, the Group risk and insurance management policy is
to work with the relevant internal department of each subsidiary to:

— define scenarios of major disaster risks (estimated maximum.
loss);

— _ assess the potential financial impact on the Group should a
catastrophic event occur;

3.4.3. Insurance policy

The Group has worldwide property insurance and third-party liability
coverage for all its subsidiaries. These programs are contracted with
first-class insurers (or reinsurers and oil and gas industry mutual
insurance companies through ORC).

The amounts insured depend on the financial risks defined in the
disaster scenarios and the coverage terms offered by the market
(available capacities and price conditions).

More specifically for:

— third-party liability: because the maximum financial risk cannot
be evaluated by a systematic approach, the amounts insured
are based on market conditions and oil and gas industry practice.
In 2018, the Group's third-party liability insurance for any
third-party liability (including potential accidental environmental
liabilities) was capped at $900 million (onshore) and $850 million
(offshore). In addition, the Group adopts, where appropriate, the
necessary means to manage the compensation of victims in the
event of an industrial accident for which it is liable; and

— _ property damage and business interruption: the amounts insured
vary by sector and by site and are based on the estimated cost
and scenarios of reconstruction under maximum loss situations
and on insurance market conditions. The Group subscribed for
business interruption coverage in 2018 for its main refining and
petrochemical sites.

For example, for the Group’s highest risks (its North Sea platforms
and main refineries or petrochemical plants), in 2018 the insurance
limit for the Group's share of the installations was approximately
$2 billion for the Refining & Chemicals segment and approximately
$2.25 billion for the Exploration & Production segment.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

— help implement measures to limit the probability that a
catastrophic event occurs and the financial consequences if such
event should occur; and

— manage the level of financial risk from such events to be either
covered internally by the Group or transferred to the insurance
market.

Deductibles for property damage and third-party liability fluctuate
between €0.1 and €10 million depending on the level of risk and
liability, and are borne by the relevant subsidiaries. For business
interruption, coverage is triggered 60 days after the occurrence giving
rise to the interruption. In addition, the main refineries and
petrochemical plants bear a combined retention for property damage
and business interruption of $75 million per insurance claim.

Other insurance contracts are bought by the Group in addition to
property damage and _ third-party liability coverage, mainly in
connection with car fleets, credit insurance and employee benefits.
These risks are mostly underwritten by outside insurance companies.

The above-described policy is provided as an example of a situation
as of a given date and cannot be considered as representative of
future conditions. The Group's insurance policy may be changed at
any time depending on market conditions, specific circumstances
and General Management's assessment of the risks incurred and
the adequacy of their coverage.

TOTAL believes that its insurance coverage is in line with industry
practice and sufficient to cover normal risks in its operations.
However, the Group is not insured against all potential risks. In the
event of a major environmental disaster, for example, TOTAL's liability
may exceed the maximum coverage provided by its third-party liability
insurance. The loss TOTAL could suffer in the event of such disaster
would depend on all the facts and circumstances of the event and
would be subject to a whole range of uncertainties, including legal
uncertainty as to the scope of liability for consequential damages,
which may include economic damage not directly connected to the
disaster. The Group cannot guarantee that it will not suffer any
uninsured loss, and there can be no guarantee, particularly in the
event of a major environmental disaster or industrial accident, that
such loss would not have a material adverse effect on the Group.

3.5 Vigilance Plan
3.5.1 Introduction

3.5.1.1 Background and Group commitments

In accordance with Article L. 225-102-4 of the French Commercial
Code, the vigilance plan (hereafter referred to as the “Vigilance Plan”)
aims to set out the reasonable measures of vigilance put in place
within the Group in order to identify the risks and prevent severe
impacts on human rights and fundamental freedoms, human health
and safety and the environment resulting from the activities of the
Company and those of the companies it controls as defined in point
Il of Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code, directly or
indirectly, as well as the activities of subcontractors or suppliers with
which it has an established commercial relationship, where such
activities are linked to this relationship.

TOTAL operates in over 130 countries in a variety of complex
economic and socio-cultural contexts and in business areas that are
likely to present risks that fall within the scope of the Vigilance Plan.

The One Total company project, which embodies the Group's
ambition to become the responsible energy major, is based
specifically on Safety and Respect for Each Other, the two core
values central to the Group's collective principles. In addition to
complying with applicable legislation in each country where the Group.
operates which most often aims at preventing severe impacts in the
scope of Article L. 225-102-4 of the French Commercial Code, TOTAL.
relies on structured frameworks and stringent risk management
systems for the conduct of its operations.

The Vigilance Plan and its implementation are part of a dynamic
process aimed at continual improvement of the Group's practices
with regard to the issues identified within each of the areas
concerned.

3.5.1.2 Method and preparation of the Vigilance Plan

The Vigilance Plan covers the activities (hereafter referred to as the
“Activities”) of TOTAL S.A. and its fully consolidated subsidiaries as
defined in Il of Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code
(hereafter referred to as the “Subsidiaries”). Certain companies, such
as Hutchinson, Saft Groupe and SunPower, have set up risk
management and severe impact prevention measures specific to
their organizations and activities; those measures related to Article
L. 225-102-4 of the French Commercial Code are specified in the
Group's Vigilance Plan. In addition, for newly acquired companies,
reasonable vigilance measures are intended to be implemented
progressively during the integration phase of these companies into
the Group systems. They do not therefore fall within the scope of the
Vigilance Plan for 2018.

The Vigilance Plan also covers the activities of suppliers of goods
and services with which TOTAL S.A. and its Subsidiaries have an
established commercial relationship, where such activities are
associated with that relationship (hereafter referred to as the
“Suppliers”). In accordance with legal provisions, suppliers with which
the Group does not have an established commercial relationship do
not fall within the scope of the Plan.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Vigilance Plan

The Vigilance Plan sets out the rules and measures which, as part of
risk management systems, enable the Group to identify and prevent
actual or potential severe impacts related to its Activities and to
mitigate their effects thereof, as the case may be. It does not
guarantee that the risks identified will not materialize. It reflects the
responsible purchasing principles applicable to relationships with
Suppliers, but is not aimed at replacing the measures in place at
those Suppliers.

Finally, the Vigilance Plan covers the risks set forth under Article
L. 225-102-4 of the French Commercial Code.

3.5.1.3. Dialogue with stakeholders

TOTAL sets up dialogue procedures with its stakeholders at every
level of its organization.

In accordance with the Group's framework on societal matters,
stakeholders are identified, mapped and prioritized according to their
levels of expectations and involvement. This mapping is kept up to
date. A structured dialogue with the stakeholders is established and
maintained, initially at local level but also at the central level.

At the local level, TOTAL has deployed since 2006 its internal
Stakeholder Relationship Management (SRM+) methodology.
This approach aims to list the main stakeholders of each Subsidiary
and site (depots, refineries, etc.), to categorize them, to schedule
consultation meetings to better understand their expectations,
concerns and opinions. This approach then permits to define action
plans to manage the impacts of activities and to take into account
local development needs in order to build a long-term trusting
relationship. This mechanism is used to explain the Group's Activities
to communities and other stakeholders, and to pay particular
attention to potentially vulnerable local populations. It has been
integrated in almost all the Subsidiaries. The system is supplemented
by a network of mediators with local communities, deployed within
the Exploration & Production segment to maintain a constructive
dialogue with neighboring communities.

At the central level, the relevant departments of the Holding also
ensure that dialogue is maintained with the Group's stakeholders.
For example, in 2018 upon publication of the Information Document
on Human Rights, the Human Rights Department of the Civil Society
Engagement Division consulted certain of its stakeholders on the
risk map published in the 2017 Vigilance Plan. This consultation led
to the conclusion that the mapping could thus be maintained.

Among these numerous stakeholders, TOTAL maintains regular
dialogue with the Group's employees and their representatives who
have a privileged position and role.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Vigilance Plan

3.5.2 Severe impact risk mapping

The mapping work presented below was carried out using the
Group's existing risk management tools. This work was
supplemented with regard to Suppliers by a mapping of the risks
related to procurement, by category of goods and services, on the
basis of questionnaires completed by the managers of each
purchasing category.

3.5.2.1 Human rights and fundamental freedoms

The risks of severe impacts on human rights and fundamental
freedoms have been identified in accordance with the criteria set out
in the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework, namely the scale,
scope and remediability of the impact.

This identification work was carried out in 2016 in consultation with
internal and external stakeholders. The process included in particular
workshops with representatives of key functions within the Group
and Subsidiaries operating in sensitive contexts or situations
particularly exposed to risks related to human rights and fundamental
freedoms, and a series of interviews with independent third parties
(GoodCorporation, International Alert and Collaborative Learning
Project).

As a result, the following risks of severe negative impacts on human
rights and fundamental freedoms were identified:

— forced labor, which corresponds to any work or service which
people are forced to do against their will, under threat of
punishment; as well as child labor, which is prohibited for any
person aged under 15, or under 18 for all types of work deemed
hazardous in accordance with International Labour Organization
standards;

— discrimination, characterized by unfair or unfavorable treatment
of people, particularly due to their origin, sex, age, disability,
sexual and gender orientation, or membership of a political or
religious group, trade union or minority;

— non-compliance with fair and safe working conditions, such as
for example the absence of employment contracts, excessive
working hours or lack of decent compensation;

— restriction of access to land by neighboring local communities,
resulting from the Group having, for some of its projects,
temporary or permanent access to the land that might result in
the physical and/or economic displacement and relocation of
these groups;

— impacts on the right to health of local communities, such as
noise and dust emissions and other impacts generated by the
Activities that might have consequences for the health of local
communities, their means of subsistence and their access to
vital services such as drinking water, for example; and

— the risk of disproportionate use of force, when intervention by
government security forces or private security companies might
be necessary to protect the Group's staff and facilities.

3.5.3. Action Principles

The Group has frameworks that set out the Action principles to be
followed in order to respect the Group's values and prevent severe
impacts on human rights and fundamental freedoms, human health
and safety and the environment (the “Action Principles”). When the

(1) Refer to the definition in point 5.4.1 of chapter 5.

3.5.2.2 Safety, health and environment

The Group defines the risk of a severe impact on safety, health or the
environment as the probability of TOTAL’s Activities having a direct
and significant impact on the health or safety of employees of Group
companies, employees of external contractors" and third parties, or
on sensitive natural environments. This risk can materialize gradually
or suddenly.

TOTAL has developed safety, health and environment risk assessment
procedures and tools applicable to operate its Activities, such as
analyses performed regularly at various levels (Group, activities and/or
industrial sites):

— prior to investment decisions in industrial projects of the Group,
acquisition and divestment decisions;

— during operations;
— prior to releasing new substances on the market.
These analyses have highlighted the following risks of severe impacts:

— the risks to the safety of people and to the environment resulting
from a major industrial accident (on an offshore site, onshore site
or during the transport of products). These risks are, for example,
an explosion, fire or leakage, resulting in death or injury and/or
accidental pollution on a large scale or at an environmentally
sensitive site;

— the risks to the safety of people and to the environment related
to the physical characteristics of oil and gas fields, particularly
during drilling operations, which can cause blow outs, explosions,
fires or other damages;

— the risks to the safety of people and to the environment related
to the overall life cycle of the products manufactured, and to the
substances and raw materials used; and

— the risks associated with transportation, for which the likelihood
of an operational accident depends not only on the hazardous
nature of the products handled, but also on the volumes, the
length of the journey and the sensitivity of the regions through
which they are transported (quality of infrastructure, population
density, environment).

Climate change is a global risk for the planet and results from various
human actions such as energy production and consumption. As an
energy producer, TOTAL seeks to reduce its direct greenhouse gas
emissions resulting from its operated Activities. In addition, TOTAL
implements a strategy to tackle climate change challenges and
reports on this in details, notably in its statement of non-financial
performance (refer to point 5.6 of chapter 5), in accordance with
Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code.

legal provisions applicable to the Activities provide less protection than
the Group's Action Principles, TOTAL strives under all circumstances
to give precedence to the latter, while seeking to ensure that it does
not infringe any applicable mandatory public policy.

(2) Sensitive natural environments include, in particular, remarkable or highly vulnerable natural areas, such as the Arctic, and/or areas covered by regulatory protection (integral nature
reserves, central park areas, biotope orders in France, etc.), as well as areas covered by significant regulatory protection such as Protected Area Categories | to IV as defined by the

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

3.5.3.1 Code of Conduct

TOTAL's Vigilance Plan is based primarily on the Group's Code of
Conduct", which specifies the Group's values, including the two
core values of Safety and Respect for the Other, particularly declining
in the areas of respect for human rights, the environment and the
health and safety of persons.

The Code particularly sets forth the Group’s compliance with the
following international standards:

— the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;

— the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business & Human
Rights;

— the principles set out in the International Labour Organization's
fundamental conventions;

— the principles of the United Nations Global Compact;
— _ the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; and
— the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

The Code of Conduct, which can be consulted on the Group's
website, is aimed at all employees and external stakeholders (host
countries, local communities, customers, suppliers, industrial and
commercial partners and shareholders). It was updated in December
2018.

3.5.3.2 Safety Health Environment Quality Charter

The Group ensures that it complies with strict safety, security, health
and environment standards in the performance of its Activities.
The Safety Health Environment Quality Charter sets out the principles
that apply to the conduct of its operations in all of the countries
where it operates.

As such, the Group’s Subsidiaries? implement a framework
incorporating occupational health and safety, security, societal
commitment and environment as well as associated management
systems (Management And Expectations Standards Towards Robust
Operations, MAESTRO).

3.5.4 Organization

The Group's organization is structured around three main levels:
Corporate, business segments and operational entities. The Action
Principles are driven by the Executive Committee. The People and
Social Responsibility Division headed by a member of the Executive
Committee coordinates the Group's action in the area of Human
Resources, health — safety — environment (HSE), security and societal
commitments. Purchases of goods and services are under the
authority of an entity in the Total Global Services Branch which also
reports to the Executive Committee member responsible for this
division. This organization aims to support operational managers in
the implementation of the Action Principles. Each level is involved in
and accountable for identifying and implementing the reasonable
vigilance measures deemed appropriate.

3.5.4.1 Ethics Committee

The Ethics Committee is a central structure representing all of the
Group's business segments. All its members are Group employees
who collectively have good knowledge of its activities and have
demonstrated the independence and impartiality necessary for
carrying out their duties.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Vigilance Plan

With regard to safety at work, the Golden Rules, which were
established on the basis of feedback and restructured in 2017 into a
set of “dos and don'ts”, apply to all Group entities, employees and
Suppliers on site. Each individual must ensure that they are adopted,
strictly followed and monitored on the ground. Each individual is also
authorized to use his or her “Stop Card” and stop any work under
way in particular in the case of non-compliance with any of these
rules.

3.5.3.3 Fundamental Principles of Purchasing

The relationship between the Group and its Suppliers is based on
adherence to the principles set forth in the Code of Conduct and in
the Fundamental Principles of Purchasing ®.

The Fundamental Principles of Purchasing specify the commitments
that TOTAL expects from its suppliers in the following areas: respect
for human rights at work, health protection, safety and security,
preservation of the environment, prevention of corruption and conflicts
of interest and fraud, respect for competition law, as well as the
promotion of economic and social development.

The requirements specified by this document must be communicated
to Suppliers and be included in or transposed into agreements.
These principles are available for consultation by all suppliers in both
French and English on TOTAL’s website.

3.5.3.4 Internal control framework

At the Group, business segment and Subsidiary level, internal controls
are based on specific procedures for organization, delegation of
responsibilities and staff awareness and training, based on the
framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).

TOTAL has a Group reference framework that is supplemented by a
series of practical recommendations and feedback. Like the Group's
organization, this framework has a three-level structure: a Group
level, with the REFLEX Group framework and the technical framework
set out by the Group Technology Committee, frameworks for each
business segment, and a specific framework for each significant
operational entity.

The Ethics Committee is the guarantor of compliance with the Code
of Conduct and ensures its proper implementation. It is assisted in
its work by the relevant departments, as well as by a network of local
Ethics Officers. The Chairperson of the Ethics Committee reports to
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TOTAL. The Chairperson
submits an annual report to the Executive Committee and the
Governance and Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors.

Employees and stakeholders can refer any breach of the Code of
Conduct to the Ethics Committee at any time, in accordance with
the procedure described in point 3.5.7. The members of the Ethics
Committee are subject to a confidentiality obligation.

3.5.4.2 Human Rights Committee and Department

The Human Rights Committee is made up of representatives from
different departments (safety, purchasing and societal commitment
in particular) and business segments. It meets several times a year
and coordinates actions relating to human rights and fundamental
freedoms led by the various business segments and Subsidiaries, in
line with the Human Rights roadmap approved by the Executive
Committee.

(1) SunPower, a company listed on the NASDAQ in the United States and in which TOTAL has a majority interest, has a Code of professional conduct specific to the company that sets forth
its values and the ethical principles with which all employees, as well as suppliers and partners, must comply. It covers subjects relating to compliance, integrity and protection of the
‘company's assets, as well as certain issues relating to human rights, fundamental freedoms, human health and safety and environment.

(2) Hutchinson and SunPower have developed HSE management systems specific to their activities and organization (for example, The Environmental Health Safety & Quality Management

System).

(8) Saft Groupe and SunPower have defined fundamental principles of purchasing specific to their activities (for example, SunPower Supplier Sustainability Guidelines).

RISKS AND CONTROL

Vigilance Plan

The Human Rights Department, within the Civil Society Engagement
Division, supports the Group's operational managers with its expertise
in implementing the Action Principles relating to human rights and
fundamental freedoms.

3.5.4.3. Occupational Health, Safety and
Environment Division

Since 2016, a single HSE Division combines the Group's
Occupational Health, Safety and Environment functions. Its role is to
implement a strong and unified HSE model.

Within the division, the HSE Departments of the Exploration &
Production, Gas, Renewables & Power, Refining & Chemicals and
Marketing & Services segments are in particular responsible for
supporting the implementation of the Group’s HSE policy. Specific
expert units set up in 2016 cover the following areas: major risks,
human and organizational factors, environmental and societal issues,
transportation and storage, crisis management and_ pollution
prevention, standards and legislation, audits and feedback.

3.5.5 Assessment procedures

The Group has set up procedures for assessing its Subsidiaries and
Suppliers, particularly in conjunction with independent bodies, which
help identify and prevent risks of severe impacts on human rights
and fundamental freedoms, human health and safety.

3.5.5.1 Procedures for assessing Subsidiaries

HSE assessments

The Audit and Feedback Unit within the central HSE Division is a key
component of HSE governance. It steers the internal control
mechanisms intended to verify compliance with the Group's HSE
requirements.

This mechanism is organized around a self-assessment to be carried
out by the Subsidiaries at least every two years and an assessment
every three to five years conducted by the Audit unit and feedback
based on an audit protocol. The objective is to identify potential gaps
in the application of the rules by the Subsidiairies and to enable them
to define and implement improvement actions.

This unit is also in charge of analysis of major incidents and management
of feedback.

Additionally, the Management Committee of each of the Group's
business segments performs monitoring of its major risk analyses
and of the progress of the associated action plans.

Lastly, the HSE Division steers the measurement and reporting work
relating to greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the Activities.
These direct greenhouse gas measurements (Scope 1) are published
in section 3.5.9.2 of this Chapter.

Assessments regarding human rights and fundamental
freedoms

Since 2002, the Group has engaged GoodCorporation, a company
specialized in ethical assessments, to verify the proper application of
the principles set out in the Code of Conduct at the Subsidiary level.
These assessments include criteria relating to human rights and
fundamental freedoms, and corruption. As part of the process, a
selection of employees and external stakeholders of the Subsidiary
are questioned to understand how their Activities are perceived locally.
Following the assessment, the Subsidiary in question defines and
implements an action plan and a monitoring procedure.

3.5.4.4 Procurement

Since January 1, 2017, a dedicated subsidiary, Total Global
Procurement centralizes management of a large part of the Group's
goods and services purchasing"), whether for categories of products
or services specific to one business activity or categories shared
between several business activities. In the Subsidiaries, purchasers
implement framework agreements as well as manage local
procurement.

A Responsible Purchasing Committee meets at least once a year
and brings together the Management Committee of Total Global
Procurement and the Civil Society Engagement (including the Human
Rights Department), HSE and Legal Divisions as well as the Ethics
Committee in order to monitor implementation of the Group's
Responsible Purchasing roadmap. The roadmap sets out the
strategic direction of the Responsible Purchasing working group.

Furthermore, the Vetting department of Trading & Shipping defines
and applies the selection criteria for the tankers and barges used to
transport the Group's liquid petroleum or chemical products and gas
products, in order to ascertain their technical qualities relative to the
best international standards, the crews’ experience and the quality
of the ship owners’ technical management.

Furthermore, TOTAL works with the Danish Institute for Human Rights
(DIHR), an independent national body for the defense and promotion
of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which assesses the
impact on human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Group's
activities in sensitive contexts.

In some cases, the Group works with independent experts such as
CDA, a company specialized in preventing and managing conflict
between businesses and local communities. The reports by CDA are
published online on its website.

Lastly, an annual self-assessment questionnaire enables each of the
Group's Subsidiaries and operational entities to measure and evaluate
the level of implementation of their societal governance on the field.
Actions involving dialogue, impact management and the contribution
to socioeconomic and cultural development are recorded and
analyzed.

3.5.5.2 Procedures for assessing Suppliers

The Supplier qualification process was harmonized at Group level in
2017 by Total Global Procurement. A new internal framework was
published in 2018. In particular, it was used to set up a new IT
qualification tool to be deployed progressively within the Group which
also will serve as a consolidated database. The framework covers
human rights, environment, health and safety.

Depending on the results of a risk analysis carried out by Suppliers,
a detailed assessment is performed. It includes questionnaires
addressing the aforementioned issues and, if needed, an action plan,
a technical inspection of the site by employees or an audit of working
conditions carried out by a specialist service provider with which a
framework agreement was signed in 2016. Crude oil and petroleum
product purchasing by Trading & Shipping, gas and electricity
purchasing by the subsidiary Total Gas & Power Ltd, and the
purchases made by the Subsidiaries Hutchinson, Saft Groupe and
SunPower are subject to Supplier qualification processes specific to
their organizations.

This qualification process may be completed if needed by specific
organizations, such as the unit put in place in the Group as from
September 2018 for the selection of palm oil suppliers. This unit
aims to ensure that palm oil purchases are made on the basis of
sustainability certifications such as the ISCC EU certification.

(1) With the exception of purchases made by the Subsidiaries Hutchinson, Saft Groupe and SunPower. Total Global Procurement made purchases from over 100,000 suppliers worldwide in

This type of certification incorporates criteria relating to carbon
footprint, anti-deforestation, good use of land and respect for human
rights. In addition to this mandatory certification, suppliers must have
signed the Fundamental principles of purchasing and be members.
of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).

As regards the chartering of tankers and barges, any operation that
involves tankers or barges calling at a terminal operated by a Group
Subsidiary, carrying shipments that belong to the Group or chartered
by TOTAL must be approved in advance by the Vetting department.
Responses are given on the basis of technical data and independently

3.5.6 Awareness and training actions

3.5.6.1 Awareness and training of Group employees

The Group has put in place a variety of communication and
information channels enabling all employees of TOTAL S.A. and its
Subsidiaries to have access to the Action Principles defined by the
Group in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms, health,
safety and the environment.

The Code of Conduct is distributed to all employees and can be
consulted on the Group's website. All new employees must confirm
that they are familiar with it.

Events such as the annual Business Ethics Day are used to raise
awareness among employees of TOTAL S.A. and its Subsidiaries.
Practical guides are available on the Group's intranet, such as the
Human Rights Guide and the Guide to dealing with religious questions
within the Group, to help Group employees apply the commitments.
provided for in the Code of Conduct in each individual cases.

The HSE Division organizes the Group's World Safety Day, which
aims to bring teams on board and raise awareness of ways to put
the HSE Action Principles into practice. The Group's employees
implement its safety culture on a day-to-day basis through “Safety
Moments” at the beginning of meetings or before hazardous
operations, consisting of a short discussion to reiterate the key safety
messages and align participants with mutual commitments.

Training courses, incorporating on-line educational programs as well
as technical training tailored to the various business segments, are
offered to all Group employees.

Dedicated human rights and fundamental freedoms training programs
have been set up for senior executives, site directors and the
employees most exposed to these issues. Awareness-raising
sessions on these subjects are organised regularly for employees, as.
is the case at the time of ethical assessments of Subsidiaries. In the
field of procurement, training modules explaining the Group's ethical
commitments and the Fundamental Principles of Purchasing have
also been developed for the Group's purchasers.

3.5.7. Whistleblowing mechanisms

To support employees on a day-to-day basis, the Group encourages,
a climate of dialogue and trust that enables individuals to express
their opinions and concerns. Employees can thus go to their line
manager, an HR or other manager, their Compliance Officer or their
Ethics Officer.

The Group's employees and Suppliers, as well as any other
external stakeholder, can contact the Ethics Committee to ask
questions or report any incident where there is a risk of
non-compliance with the Code of Conduct using the generic email

Vigilance Plan

of any commercial considerations. The audits conducted with ship
owners also permit the assessment of the quality of the technical
management systems implemented by the operators, crew selection
and training, as well as the support provided to vessels.

Through the annual inspections performed by inspectors representing
the Group, TOTAL is actively involved in sharing inspection reports
with other international oil and gas companies through the SIRE (ship
inspection report) Program set up by the OCIMF (Oil Companies
International Marine Forum), thus contributing to the continuous
improvement of petroleum shipping safety.

Similarly, training programs in the fields of health, safety and
environment have been rolled out within the Group reflecting different
perspectives: general, by type of activities or by subject areas.
For example, the following general training actions exist depending
on the level of responsibility and experience in the Group: HSE
Leadership for Group senior executives, HSE training for managers,
and Safety Pass training for new recruits.

3.5.6.2 Awareness and training of Suppliers

The Fundamental Principles of Purchasing are brought to the attention
of Suppliers as of their registration in the Supplier database.

Training initiatives are also undertaken with the Group’s Suppliers,
such as the responsible security training given to safety service
providers’ personnel, and the Safety Contract Owners program,
which brings together more than 650 suppliers at the Group level.

3.5.6.3. Information on product risks

All of the chemical and petroleum products marketed by the Group
are covered by a safety data sheet prepared in accordance with
applicable regulations. The packaged products are labelled
accordingly.

Each safety data sheet provides comprehensive information on the
substances or mixtures usable in the regulatory framework of
managing chemicals in the workplace. It enables users to identify the
risks linked to handling such products, particularly regarding safety
and the environment, in order to implement any measures necessary
to protect people and the environment.

Safety data sheets are available to carriers of dangerous goods,
emergency services, poison control centers, as well as professional
and industrial customers. Consumers are informed of the risks and
precautions of use through product labelling.

address (ethics@total.com). The system is supplemented by specific
whistleblowing mechanisms implemented at certain subsidiaries
(SunPower, Hutchinson).

The Group's Suppliers can also contact the internal supplier mediator
using a generic email address (mediation.fournisseurs@total.com).
The mediator is available to Suppliers and purchasers, and restores
dialogue to find solutions when measures taken with the usual
contact have been unsuccessful.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Vigilance Plan

Grievance handling procedures are also in place within the Group in
order to receive and facilitate the resolution of concerns and
grievances of local communities that may be affected by its Activities.

3.5.8 Monitoring procedures

To ensure the continuous updating of the Vigilance Plan, TOTAL relies
on existing monitoring procedures and tools relating to human rights,
safety, health and environment made available to the Subsidiaries.

Thus, the system of internal reporting and of indicators for monitoring
implementation of the actions undertaken in the Group in these areas
is based:

— for social indicators (including, in particular, health), on a guide
entitled “Corporate Social Reporting Protocol and Methodology”;

— for industrial safety indicators, on a Group rule concerning event
and statistical reporting; a feedback analysis process identifies, in
particular, events for which a structured analysis report is required
in order to learn lessons in terms of design and operation; and

— for environmental indicators, on a Group reporting procedure,
together with activity-specific instructions.

Consolidated objectives are defined for each key indicator and
reviewed annually. The business segments apply these indicators as
appropriate to their area of responsibility, analyze the results and set
out a plan.

All of the procedures enable regular monitoring of actions and areas
for improvement to be implemented in the area of human rights,
safety, health and environment. The Group Performance Management
Committee (refer to point 4.1.5.2 of chapter 4) is involved in this
approach. In particular, it is responsible for examining, analyzing and
steering the Group's HSE, financial and operational results on a
quarterly basis.

As regards HSE, an on-call system has been set upto alert the
directors of the business segments and of the Group as quickly as
possible in the case of a major incident. Depending on the incident,
a crisis management and monitoring process is put in place (refer to
point 3.3.3.1).

In addition, the committee responsible for monitoring the CSR Global
Agreement signed by TOTAL in 2015, known as the “FAIR
Committee”, meets every year in the presence of representatives
who are members of trade unions affiliated to the IndustriALL Global
Union (refer to points 5.3.3.3 and 5.10.3 of Chapter 5) and appointed
by this federation to monitor and implement the agreement. It identifies
good practice and areas for improvement in the fields of safety,
health, human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Additionally, the Group publishes a Human Rights information
document that describes the Group's Activities’ major impacts on
human rights and fundamental freedoms and the remedial measures
taken. In 2016, TOTAL became the first company in the oil industry
to have published this document in accordance with the UN Guiding
Principles Reporting Framework. It is available on the Group's website
and was updated in 2018.

Since 2015, TOTAL also publishes a report to assess the progress
made in the implementation of the Voluntary Principles on Security
and Human Rights. The information set out in the report is based on
annual reporting organized by the Security Division that brings
together the results of the risk and compliance analyses for each
subsidiary operating in a sensitive context.

Lastly, in September 2018 TOTAL published the third edition of its
“Integrating climate in our strategy” brochure dedicated to the
consideration of climate issues and detailing the Group's lines of
action in this area.

3.5.9 Report on implementation of the Vigilance Plan

3.5.9.1 Human rights and fundamental freedoms

TOTAL'’s human rights approach is based on written commitments. It
is supported by a dedicated organization, and embedded through
an awareness-raising and training program, as well as evaluation
and follow-up mechanisms aiming at measuring the effectiveness of
the Group's actions.

A) Human rights in the workplace

The prohibition of forced and child labor, non-discrimination, just and
favorable conditions of work, as well as safety all form part of the
principles set out in TOTAL’s Code of Conduct and Human Rights
Guide.

TOTAL'’s commitment to human rights in the workplace is
demonstrated, in particular, by the signature of various agreements,
such as the one concluded with IndustriALL Global Union® in 2015.
In particular, this agreement covers the promotion of human rights in
the workplace, diversity, the participation of employees and their
representatives in social dialogue and the recognition of health and
safety at work as absolute priorities in the Group's activities and
global supply chain.

In its activities

TOTAL cares about the working conditions of its employees which
are governed by the Group's Human Resources policy (refer to point
5.3 of chapter 5).

Safety is one of the Group's core values. Over the last few years, the
Group has continued to develop occupational health and safety
standards focusing on the right to enjoy fair and adequate living and
working conditions (refer to point 3.5.9.2 of this chapter).

TOTAL is committed to promoting diversity and endeavors to combat
all forms of discrimination (origin, gender, sexual orientation, handicap,
age, membership in a union or a political or religious organization,
etc.). The Diversity Council, which is chaired by a member of the
Executive Committee, illustrates this commitment.

In 2017, TOTAL published a “Practical guide to dealing with religious
questions within the Group” in order to provide practical solutions to
the questions raised by the Group's employees and managers
worldwide. It draws on the experiences of the business segments in
various countries and encourages dialog, respect and listening as a
way to find solutions suited to the local context. Many internal and
external experts helped draft this document, including representatives
of various religious communities. This guide has been translated into
nine languages.

(1) Refer to point 5.11 of chapter 5 concerning the reporting ‘s scope and medology concerning information provided in point 3.5.9 of this chapter. Since the identification of risks and the
prevention of severe impacts on human rights, human health and safety and the environment overlap partially with certain risks covered in the non-financial performance statement (refer
to chapter 5), TOTAL has chosen to report on the implementation of its Vigilance Pian by incorporating certain aspects of its non-financial performance statement although it includes risks

of varying degrees.

(2) International union federation representing more than 50 million employees in the energy, mining, manufacturing and industrial sectors in 140 countries.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018


--- Page 96 ---

In addition to the Group's reporting and internal control system, the
working conditions of TOTAL's employees are evaluated by
GoodCorporation, an independent third party, as part of the ethical
assessments of the Group's entities.

In the Group’s value chain

The Fundamental Principles of Purchasing (FPP) set out the
commitments expected from suppliers in various domains, including
human rights in the workplace and safety. A Group directive reaffirms
the obligation to annex the FPP or to transpose them in the selection
process as well as in the contracts concluded with suppliers of goods
or services.

The prevention of forced and child labor in the supply chain is a
critical point of attention identified in the 2017-2018 human rights
roadmap endorsed by the Executive Committee. TOTAL has therefore
developed a new methodology for selecting its suppliers which takes.
account the risks of human rights violations, in particular forced and
child labor. In September 2016, TOTAL also entered into a partnership
with a third-party service provider in charge of evaluating suppliers’
practices with regard to fundamental rights in the workplace (refer to
point 3.5.9.5 of this chapter).

Finally, the working conditions of the employees of service stations’
dealers are evaluated by GoodCorporation, an independent third
party, as part of the ethical assessments conducted in the Group
entities. Between 2016 and 2017, a baseline study of 22 affiliates in
the Marketing & Services segment across different continents was
also conducted. One of the main recommendations identified is to
improve service station dealers’ awareness of the Group's Code of
Conduct principles and of the fundamental Conventions of the
International Labor Organization. In response, Marketing & Services
is developing educational tools, which should be promoted in 2019
to this business segment's entities.

B) Human rights and local communities

TOTAL's operational activities may have impacts on the rights of local
communities, in particular when TOTAL obtains temporary or
permanent access to their land for Group's projects that may involve
the physical and/or economic displacement of these populations.
Noise and dust emissions and other potential impacts may also have
consequences on the livelihood of neighboring communities.
Consequently, the access to land of local communities and their right
to health and an adequate standard of living are two salient issues
for TOTAL.

In accordance with internationally recognized human rights standards,
TOTAL requires the Group entities to maintain a regular dialogue with
their stakeholders and make sure that their activities have no negative
consequences on local communities or, if these cannot be avoided,
that they limit, mitigate and remedy them. The solutions proposed in
response to the expectations of local communities are coordinated
by the societal teams that work in close collaboration with the legal,
safety and environmental teams. The Group’s approach to this topic
is described in the section on societal issues of the non-financial
performance Statement in point 5.9 of chapter 5.

(1) TRIP: Total Recordable Injury Rate.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Vigilance Plan

C) Respect for human rights in security-related activities

In certain situations, intervention by government security forces or
private security providers might be necessary to protect TOTAL staff
and assets. In order to prevent any misuse of force, TOTAL asks
Group employees, private security providers and government security
forces to implement the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human
Rights (VPSHR) issued by States, NGOs and Extractive Companies.

TOTAL has been a member of this initiative since 2012. Within
this framework, the Group publishes an annual report setting
out the challenges, lessons learned and good practices in relation to
security and human rights and, if applicable, reports any incidents
associated with the Group's activities. This report is available at
sustainable-performance.total.com.

Self-assessment and risk analysis tools have been developed and
are deployed, in particular, in the entities located in high risk countries
and conflict zones.

When government security forces are deployed to ensure the
protection of the Group's staff and assets, the Group entities maintain
an ongoing dialogue with the representatives of national or regional
authorities in order to raise their awareness on the need to respect
the VPSHR and encourage them to sign memorandums of
understanding that comply with these principles.

TOTAL regularly organizes training sessions and awareness-raising
activities on the risk of misuse of force, and more generally on the
VPSHR, for its staff, private security providers and government
security forces. In 2018, TOTAL partnered with other Extractive
Companies and the Myanmar Center for Responsible Business to
organize two VPSHR awareness workshops for government officials,
private security providers and NGOs in Myanmar.

3.5.9.2 Personal health and safety

TOTAL places safety at the heart of its ambition to be a responsible
company. The measures and indicators used to manage the Group's
activities are based on this fundamental value, in accordance with
the strictest standards, particularly relating to health.

A) Preventing occupational accidents

The Group's personal safety policy covers three main areas:
preventing occupational accidents, preventing transport accidents,
and preventing accidents linked to technological risks, such as fires
and explosions. It relates to all employees of Group subsidiaries,
employees of external contractors working on these entities’ sites as
well as employees of transport companies under long-term contracts.
The safety results are monitored with the same vigilance for all.

Indicators defined according to an internal procedure measure the
main results. In addition to its aim of zero fatalities in the exercise of
its activities, the Group has set the target of continuously reducing
the TRIR" and, for 2018, of keeping it below 0.9 for all personnel
(Group and External Contractors).

The Group's safety efforts over more than 10 years have resulted in a
significant improvement in the TRIR and LTIR. Performance has
stabilized since 2016, mainly due to acquisitions and disposals of
assets or subsidiaries. The gradual implementation of the One
MAESTRO framework aims to strengthen the Group's safety culture
and create a new drive to improve safety results. Despite the
measures put in place, in 2018 three accidents resulted in the death
of four employees working for external contractors: one during road
transport in Ethiopia, one during a handling operation in the Republic
of the Congo, and two during an operation to recommission a fuel
storage tank in Egypt.

Generally, an analysis is launched in response to any type of accident
whatsoever. The method and scope of the analysis depend on the
actual or potential severity of the event. Consequently, a near miss
with a high severity potential is treated as a severe accident, and its
analysis is considered an essential factor of progress. Depending on
its relevance to the other Group entities, it triggers a safety alert and
the distribution of a feedback form, depending on the circumstances.

Regarding occupational safety, since 2010, the basic rules to be
scrupulously followed by all personnel, employees and contractors
alike, in all of the Group’s businesses worldwide, are described in the
document “Safety at Work: TOTAL's Twelve Golden Rules”, which
has been widely circulated within the Group.

The aim of the Golden Rules is to set out simple, easy-to-remember
rules that cover a large number of occupational accidents. In addition,
further rules can be found in the One MAESTRO HSE framework,
the business segment frameworks and the subsidiary frameworks.

According to the Group's internal statistics, in more than 44% of
severe incidents or near misses with high severity potential in the
workplace, at least one of the Golden Rules had not been followed.
The proper application of these Golden Rules, and more generally of
all occupational safety procedures, is verified through site visits and
internal audits. The Stop Card system, which was set up in 2015,
also enables any employee of the Group or an external contractor to
intervene if any of the Golden Rules is not being followed. In addition,
in 2016, the HSE department created a unit bringing together the
reference persons on high-risk operations (work at height, lifting,
high-pressure cleaning, excavations, etc.) in order to consolidate
in-house knowledge and relations with contractors.

The reporting of anomalies and near misses (approximately
600,000 per year) is strongly encouraged on a daily basis and is
permanently monitored. The ability of each employee to identify
anomalies or dangerous situations is one of the measures of the
employees’ involvement and vigilance in accident prevention and
reflects the safety culture within the Group. In 2016, the Group HSE
Department also created a unit aimed at providing support for sites
to improve their safety culture upon their request.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

Regarding road transport, for many years the Group has been
monitoring the number of severe road accidents involving its
employees and those of external contractors. The actions taken have
reduced the number of severe accidents between 2016 and 2018
by 33%. Work began in new areas in 2018, particularly relating to the
use of new technologies in accident prevention (defining a new
standard for the light vehicles used, driver fatigue detection) and the
assessment of the driver support and assistance systems offered by
manufacturers (automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist,
lane change assist, etc.).

Heavy goods vehicles” 23 26 36

(@) Overturned vehicle or other accident resulting in the injury of a crew member (deciared
incident),
(6) Vehicles on long-term contract with the Group (>6 months).

With regard to technological risks (also known as “major” industrial
risks), the risk analysis and prevention actions are described in point
3.5.9.3.B of this chapter.

Whatever the nature of the accident, prevention actions rely on all
employees abiding by the Group's safety policies. These are
disseminated through training courses aimed at the various groups
of employees (new arrivals, managers, senior executives, etc.).

As TOTAL's core value, Safety has been a component of the Group's
employee compensation policy since 2011. A portion of the variable
compensation received by employees, as well as by senior executives
and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, depends on the
achievement of HSE targets (refer to point 4.3.2 of chapter 4 and
point 5.3.1 of chapter 5).

With regard to security, the Group has put in place means to analyze
threats and assess risks in order to take preventive measures to limit
its exposure to security risks in the countries where it operates.

B) Preventing occupational health risks through
improved assessment

With regard to prevention of occupational health risks, the Group
implements a policy that defines the risk assessment methodology
to be applied by all Group entities and subsidiaries. The associated
Group directive stipulates that the assessment includes chemical,
physical, biological, ergonomic and psychosocial risks, and that it
must result in the design and roll-out of an action plan. In addition, it
requires that each Group entity sets out a formal medical monitoring
procedure taking into account the requirements under local law
(frequency, type of examination, etc.) and the level of exposure of its
personnel to the various risks.

To complement this program, the Group has set up an employee
health observatory. The aim is to monitor the health of a sample of
employees in order to identify the emergence of certain illnesses
and, if applicable, suggest appropriate preventive measures. The
data is gathered anonymously during medical examinations and
covers approximately 12% of Group employees worldwide.

The Group also has a Medical Advisory Committee that meets
regularly to discuss key health issues relating to the Group's activities.
It decides whether there is a need for additional health protection
strategies to be implemented. It consists of external scientific experts
and also brings together the Group's senior executives and
stakeholders concerned by these issues.


--- Page 98 ---

In terms of prevention, the Group has decided to make psychosocial
risk prevention a priority commitment. In 2018, the Group identified
four areas of progress worldwide:

— aminimum level of awareness and training for all;

— a system for measuring stress and the quality of the social
climate, facilitating the production of action plans;

— a system for listening to and supporting employees in difficult
situations;

— coordination of actions and monitoring of indicators.

A Quality of Life at Work and Health working group was set up in
September 2018 to coordinate and ensure the effectiveness of all of
the actions taken. Led by the Group Human Resources division, all
of TOTAL's business segments are represented, particularly the
international medical department. Its first task is to create and roll
out a Worldwide Psychosocial Risk (PSR) Prevention program that
addresses the four areas for progress.

Regarding the priority commitment to training, a fully updated PSR
pack aimed at entity managers, prevention contributors and managers
was finalized in 2018. Approved by international experts, it has now
been translated into 11 languages and is the core material for training
on this subject. The pack consists of two guides: a methodological
guide for entity managers and anyone with a role in PSR prevention,
and a practical guide for managers to raise awareness of the
importance of the quality of life at work as a key factor in preventing
PSRs. It also aims to support them in the day-to-day management
of their teams in the event of difficulties, risky situations and crisis
situations.

On a broader level, TOTAL is helping to promote individual and
collective health programs in the countries where it operates,
including vaccination campaigns and screening programs for certain
diseases (AIDS, cancer, malaria, etc.) for employees, their families
and local communities. Action is also taken regularly to raise
awareness Of lifestyle risks (anti-smoking and anti-drinking campaigns,
etc.).

The Group has put in place the following indicators to monitor the
performance of its program:

Health indicators (\W/HRS scope) 2018 2017 2016

Percentage of employees with
specific occupational risks benefiting
from regular medical monitoring ® 98% 98% 99%

Number of occupational illnesses

with local regulations) 154 143 108

(a) Asan exception to the reporting principles described in section 5.11 of chapter 5, the 2018
rate does not include a company that did not report its data in time for the 2018 WHRS.

Reporting on occupational illnesses covers only the Group’s
personnel (WHRS scope) and illnesses reported according to the
regulations applicable in the country of operation of each entity.

Musculoskeletal disorders, the main cause of occupational illnesses
in the Group, represented 69% of all recorded illnesses in 2018,
against 68% in 2017. Therefore, in addition to ergonomic risk
assessments and the gradual training of personnel on its sites, the
annual Group Industrial Hygiene Day in December 2017 was on the
theme of Ergonomics and Musculoskeletal disorders.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Vigilance Plan

The annual Group Industrial Hygiene day held in September 2018
was dedicated to asbestos and refractory ceramic fibers.

C) Minimizing the risks throughout the life cycle of
products to prevent consumer health and safety risks

Unless certain precautions are taken, some of the products marketed
by TOTAL pose potential risks to the health and safety of consumers.
The Group therefore aims to meet its obligations with regard to
information and prevention in order to minimize the risks throughout
the life cycle of its products.

TOTAL's health and products directive sets out the minimum
requirements to be observed by the Group's entities and subsidiaries
for marketing the Group's products worldwide in order to reduce
potential risks to consumer health and the environment. TOTAL
identifies and assesses the risks inherent to its products and their
use. The material safety data sheets (MSDS) that accompany the
products marketed by the Group (in at least one of the languages
used in the country) as well as product labels are two key sources of
information. All new products comply with the regulatory requirements
in the countries and markets for which they are intended.

3.5.9.3 Environment

TOTAL places the environment at the heart of its ambition of being a
responsible company. In light of the specific nature of its activities,
the Group's operations pose risks for which TOTAL develops
structured management systems.

Environmental indicators have been monitored for many years in
order to constantly adapt the Group's environmental protection
measures, which are presented in this section.

A) General policy and environmental targets

TOTAL considers the respect for the environment to be a priority. All
employees, at every level, must do their utmost to protect the
environment as they go about their work. TOTAL strives to control its
energy consumption, its emissions in natural environments (water,
air, soil), its residual waste production, its use of natural resources
and its impact on biodiversity. With regards to the environment,
TOTAL takes a constructive approach that is based on transparency
and dialogue when communicating with its stakeholders and third
parties.

To this end, the HSE division and the HSE departments within the
Group's entities seek to ensure both applicable local regulations and
internal requirements resulting from the Safety Health Environment
Quality Charter and the Group's additional commitments are
respected. Group steering bodies, led by the HSE division, are tasked
with:

— monitoring TOTAL’s environmental performance, which is
reviewed annually by the Executive Committee, for which
multi-annual improvement targets are set;

— handling, in conjunction with the business segments, the various
environment-related subjects of which they are in charge; and

— promoting the internal standards to be applied by the Group's
operational entities.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

The Group’s environmental targets ®:
— decrease SO, air emissions by 50% between 2010 and 2020;

— maintain hydrocarbon content of water discharges below
30 mg/l for offshore sites and below 15 mg/l for onshore and
coastal sites;

— valorize more than 50% of the waste produced by the sites
operated by the Group.

Moreover, the Group is committed to:

— _ systematically develop biodiversity action plans for production
sites located in protected areas");

— _ not conducting oil and gas exploration or production operations
in the area of natural sites listed on the UNESCO World
Heritage List;

— _ not conducting exploration in oil fields under sea ice in the
Arctic.

@) For climate, refer to point 3.5.9.4.D of this chapter.

The Group's internal requirements state that the environmental
management systems of its operated sites that are important for the
environment) must be ISO 14001 certified within two years of
start-up of operations or acquisition: 100% of these 71 sites were in
conformity in 2018. Beyond these internal requirements, at the end
of 2018, a total of 264 sites operated by the Group were
ISO 14001 certified. In 2018, the Moho Nord site (Republic of the
Congo) has been ISO 14001 certified.

All investment, divestment or acquisition projects which are submitted
to the Executive Committee for approval are assessed and reviewed
with regards to their risks and impact, particularly environmental,
before the final investment decision is made.

TOTAL seeks to ensure that all employees share its environmental
protection requirements. Employees receive training in the required
skills. TOTAL also raises employee awareness through internal
communication campaigns (e.g., in-house magazines, intranet, posters).

B) Preventing incident risks

To prevent incident risks and, in particular, major industrial events,
TOTAL carries out periodic risk assessments and implements
adapted risk-management policies and measures.

The Group has management structures and systems that present
similar requirements and expectations across all the entities. TOTAL
strives to minimize the potential impacts of its operations on people,
the environment and property through a major technological risk
management policy. This management draws on a shared approach
in all segments that includes, on the one hand, risk identification and
analysis, and on the other hand, the management of these risks.

This structured approach applies to all of the Group's operated
businesses exposed to these risks. In addition to its drilling and
pipeline transport operations, the Group has at the end of
2018 1985 sites and operating zones exposed to major technological
risks, which could cause harm or damage to people, property and
the environment, corresponding to:

— all the offshore and onshore operating activities in Exploration &
Production; and

— the Seveso classified industrial sites (upper and lower threshold)
and their equivalents outside the EU (excluding Exploration &
Production).

This approach first sets out an analysis of the risks related to the
Group's industrial operations, on each site, based on incident
scenarios for which the probability of occurrence and the severity of
the consequences are assessed.

(1) Sites located in an IUCN | to IV or Ramsar convention protected area.
(2) Natural sites included on the UNESCO World Heritage List of December 31, 2017.
(8) Sites that emit more than 30 kt CO,e per year.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

What has been accomplished:

— more than 50% reduction in SO, air emissions reached
since 2017;

— 100% of the Group's oil sites have met the target for the
quality of onshore discharges since 2016 and 96% of the
Group's oil sites have met the target for the quality of offshore
discharges in 2018;

— more than 50% of the waste produced by the sites operated
by the Group was valorized in 2018;

— 5 biodiversity action plans deployed or in preparation in 2018;

— _ no oil and gas exploration or production activity in the area of
natural sites listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List ?);

— _ no exploration activity in oil fields under sea ice in the Arctic.

Second, based on these parameters, a prioritization matrix is used
to determine whether further measures are needed in addition to
compliance with the Group's standards and local regulations. These
mainly include preventive measures but can also include mitigation
measures.

The management of major technological risks also hinges on:
— staff training and raising awareness;
— acoherent event reporting and indicators system;

— systematic, structured serious event analysis, particularly to learn
lessons in terms of design and operation;

— regularly tested contingency plans and measures.

In terms of monitoring indicators, the Group reports the number of
Tier 1 and Tier 2 events as defined by the API and the IOGP. The
Group set itself a loss of primary containment target of under 100
(Tier 1 and Tier 2) in 2018.

The target is slightly exceeded due to the inclusion of new entities in
the reporting scope. In addition to the 103 Tier 1 and Tier
2 operational events indicated in the table below, the Group recorded
four Tier 1 events and one Tier 2 event due to sabotage or theft in
2018.

Loss of primary containment 2018 2017" 2016”
Loss of primary containment (Tier 1) 30 28 38

(@ Tier 1 and Tier 2: indicator of the number of loss of primary containment events, with
more or less significant consequences, as defined by the API 754 (for downstream) and
IOGP 456 (for upstream) standards. Excluding acts of sabotage and theft.

(b) Excluding TEP Barnett in 2016 and 2017.

In accordance with industry best practices, TOTAL also monitors
accidental liquid hydrocarbon spills of more than one barrel. Spills
that exceed a predetermined severity threshold (in terms of volume
spilled, toxicity of the product in question or sensitivity of the natural
environment affected) are reviewed on a monthly basis and annual
Statistics are sent to the Group Performance Management
Committee. All large spills are followed by corrective actions aimed
at returning the environment to an acceptable state as quickly as
possible. Due to their unpredictable nature, there is no quantitative
target for accidental hydrocarbon spills. Nevertheless, changes in
the number of spills are observed and analyzed.

(a) Accidental spills with an environmental impact and of more than one barrel
(b) In 2017, the indicator perimeter was updated to exclude spills due to sabotage by a
third party.

In order to manage a major accidental spill efficiently, the Group
implemented a global crisis management system that is primarily
based on a dedicated organization and a crisis management center
at the head office to enable the management of two simultaneous
crises. As part of this process, TOTAL regularly trains in crisis
management on the basis of risk scenarios identified through
analyses.

In particular, the Group has response plans and procedures in place
in the event of a hydrocarbon leak or spill. For accidental spills that
reach the water surface, oil spill contingency plans are regularly
reviewed and tested during exercises. These plans are specific to
each company or site and are adapted to their structure, activities
and environment while complying with Group recommendations.

(2) The variation of the number of sites between 2016 and 2018 is due to perimeter variation.
(b) Decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 corresponds mainly to two subsidiaries where
equipment was being refurbished in 2018.

In the event of accidental pollution, the Group companies can call on
in-house human and material resources (Fast Oil Spill Team, FOST)
and benefit from assistance agreements with the main third-party
organizations specialized in the management of hydrocarbon spills.

Since 2014, subsea capping and subsea containment equipment
that can be transported by air has been strategically positioned at
different points of the world (South Africa, Brazil, Norway and
Singapore) in order to provide solutions that are readily available in
the event of oil or gas eruptions in deep offshore drilling operations.
From these locations, the equipment can benefit TOTAL's operations
worldwide. This equipment was developed by a group of nine oil
companies, including TOTAL, and is managed by Oil Spill Response
Ltd (OSRL), a cooperative dedicated to the response to marine
pollution by hydrocarbons. TOTAL has also designed and developed
its own capping system (“Subsea Emergency Response System") to
stop potential eruptions in drilling or production operations as quickly
as possible. Since 2015, equipment has been installed in Angola,
then the Republic of the Congo, potentially covering the entire Gulf
of Guinea region.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

For its sea and river shipment requirements, TOTAL only charters
ships and barges that meet the highest international standards. The
Group has an internal policy that lays down the process and criteria
by which ships and barges are selected (known as vetting). These
criteria are based, in particular, on the regulations, best practice and
recommendations of the OCIMF"! and, in Europe, on the European
Barge Inspection Scheme (EBIS). Tankers and barges are vetted by
a single centralized Group entity. The average age of the Group
Shipping division's time-chartered fleet is approximately six years.

With regard to operated marine terminals, the Group got involved in
an initiative that seeks to systematically record their physical
characteristics and store this data in a global database that forms
part of the Marine Terminal Information System (MTIS) of the OCIMF.
At the end of 2018, 95% of coastal marine terminals and 50% of
offshore terminals had submitted their characteristics, thereby making
it easier to assess the compatibility of ships with the ports of call.
Additionally, since 2018, large TOTAL terminals have used the Marine
Terminal Management Self Assessment (MTMSA), the framework
recommended by the industry for the self-assessment of terminals
and the continuous improvement of the safety of product transfers.
A training course on ship/shore interface management (SSSCL - Ship
Shore Safety Check List) and cargo transfer operations, developed
by the Group in 2016, had completed by operators of 80% of
operated-terminals by the end of 2018.

C) Limiting the environmental footprint

Wherever TOTAL conducts its business, it makes sure that it complies
with applicable laws and regulations, which the Group complements.
with specific requirements and commitments when necessary. TOTAL,
implements an active policy of avoiding, reducing, managing and
monitoring the environmental footprint of its operations. As part of
this policy, emissions are identified and quantified by environment
(water, air and soil) so that appropriate measures can be taken to
better control them.

Water, air

The Group's operations generate emissions into the atmosphere from
combustion plants and the various conversion processes and
discharges into wastewater. In addition to complying with applicable
legislation, the Group's companies actively pursue a policy aimed at
reducing emissions. After analyses have been conducted and when
necessary, the sites introduce various reduction systems that include
organizational measures (such as using predictive models to control
peaks in sulfur dioxide (SO,) emissions based on weather forecast
data and the improvement of combustion processes management,
etc.) and technical measures (wastewater treatment plants, using
low NO, burners and electrostatic scrubbers, etc.).

For new facilities developed by the Group, impact assessments are
systematically carried out on these emissions and, if necessary,
actions are taken to limit their impact.

In 2010, SO, emissions were 99 kt. The Group set itself the target of
not exceeding 49.5kt by 2020; it has met this target since 2017.

Chronic emissions into the atmosphere 2018 2017 2016

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

NO, emissions, which are mainly concentrated in the Exploration &
Production, are primarily located offshore and far away from the
coast. Their impact on air quality is therefore considered to be minor.

Discharged water quality

In 2018, with regards to discharges to aquatic environments, all of
the operated sites met the onshore discharge quality target set to
restrict the impact on receiving environments.

(a) Alwyn site (United Kingdom) excluded, as its produced water discharges only occur
during the maintenance periods of the water reinjection system and are subject to a
specific regulatory authorization,

In 2018, the percentage of sites conforming to the targets for quality
of offshore discharges decreased due to a site acquired as part of
the Mezersk Oil acquisition that exceeds the targets of the Group. The
water discharge from this site is minor in terms of volume and
represents less than 3% of the Group's global offshore discharge.

The improvement in the quality of onshore water discharges in 2018
is linked to a better performance of the waste water treatment plants
at Anvers, Donges and Normandie Refineries and to the expiry of the
Mahakam license in Indonesia.

Soil

The risks of soil pollution related to TOTAL’s operations come mainly
from accidental spills (refer to point 3.5.9.3.B of this chapter) and
waste storage (refer to point 3.5.9.3.E of this chapter).

The Group's approach to preventing and managing these types of
pollution is based on four key principles:

— preventing leaks, by implementing, as far as possible, industry
best practices in engineering, operations and transport;

— carrying out maintenance at appropriate frequency to minimize
the risk of leaks;

— overall monitoring of the environment to identify any soil and
groundwater pollution; and

— managing any pollution from previous activities by means of
containment and reduction or elimination operations.

In addition, a Group directive defines the following minimum
requirements:

— _ systematic identification of each site's environmental and health
impacts related to possible soil and groundwater contamination;

— assessment of soil and groundwater contamination based on
various factors (extent of pollution inside or outside the site's
boundaries, nature and concentrations of pollutants, presence
of a vector that could allow the pollution to migrate, use of the
land and groundwater in and around the site); and

— management of health or environmental impacts identified
based on the use of the site (current or future, if any) and the risk
acceptability criteria recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the Group.

TOTAL Registration Document 2018

Lastly, decommissioned Group facilities operated by Group entities
or affiliates (i-e., chemical plants, service stations, mud pits or lagoons
resulting from hydrocarbon extraction operations, wasteland on the
site of decommissioned refinery units, etc.) impact the landscape
and may, despite all the precautions taken, be sources of chronic or
accidental pollution. TOTAL created a policy of evaluation, treatment
of environmental risks related to soil and groundwater and
remediation of its sites at the end of their activity. In agreement with
the authorities, the aim is to allow new operations to be set up once
the future use of the land has been determined. Remediation
operations are conducted by specialized entities created by the
Group. At the end of 2018, 123 industrial sites that were no longer in
operation (excluding service stations) were in the process of
remediation.

Sustainable use of resources
Fresh water

The Group's activities, mainly those of Refining & Chemicals, and to
a lesser extent those of the Exploration & Production, Gas,
Renewables & Power segments, may potentially have an impact on,
as well as be dependent of, water resources. This is especially true
when an activity is located in a water resources sensitive environment.

Fully aware of these challenges, TOTAL implements the following
water risk management actions:

1. monitor water withdrawals to identify priority sensitive sites and
then carry out a risk assessment;

2. improve the water resources management depending on
identified needs, by adapting the priority sites’ environmental
management system.

In order to identify the priority facilities, TOTAL records the withdrawal
and discharge of water on all of its sites and assesses these volumes
on the basis of the current and future water stress indicators of the
WRI") Aqueduct tool (currently 9.7%" of fresh water withdrawals
take place in a global water stress area).

In addition, TOTAL assesses water resources risk levels of priority
facilities which are those that withdraw more than 500,000 m8 per
year and are located in areas potentially exposed to water resource
risks, using the Local Water Tool (LWT) for Oil & Gas from the Global
Environmental Management Initiative (GEMI). This tool also helps to
guide the actions taken to mitigate any risks in order to make optimal
use of water resources on these sites.

Globally, the sites operated by the Group are not particularly exposed
to water risk. By the end of 2018, out of the 24 priority sites identified,
the level of water risk was assessed on 16 priority Group sites
(11 Refining & Chemicals, 3 Exploration & Production, 2 Gas,
Renewables & Power). Following this assessment, two sites were
identified as being at risk and were reported to the CDP. This analysis
process is expected to be extended to other current priority sites,
including eight additional sites that have been identified.

In 2018, the Group answered the CDP Water survey for the 2017
period and was graded A-. The main indicator used in this reporting
is aggregated withdrawal.

ground surfaces that could substantially conflict with various natural
ecosystems or agriculture.

In 2018, the Group introduced a specific selection process
concerning palm oil suppliers to ensure all palm oil purchases for the
La Méde facility will be certified sustainable in accordance with
European Union criteria (ISCC EU certification) and are conducted
with a limited number of suppliers.

D) Not to harm biodiversity and ecosystems during
projects and operations

TOTAL's activities may potentially be located in sensitive natural
environments.

The Group is fully aware of this challenge and takes biodiversity and
ecosystems into account during its projects and operations. In
July 2018, and within the framework of the Act4Nature initiative, the
Group made 16 biodiversity commitments to make this policy more
tangible. The 16 commitments are described in the biodiversity
brochure available on the website sustainable-performance.total.com.
There are 10 general commitments common to all of the signatory
companies and an additional 6 commitments specific to TOTAL,
some of which existed before the initiative. These differentiate the
Group from its competitors.

3.5.9.4 Climate

TOTAL'’s ambition is to become the responsible energy major. The
Group is committed to contributing to the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals, particularly with regards to those subjects that
are connected to climate change and the development of more
available and cleaner energy for as many people as possible.

In order to make an effective contribution to the climate change
issue, TOTAL relies on an organization and structured governance
framework to make sure climate-related challenges are fully integrated
into the Group's strategy. Consequently, the Group has a robust
strategy and implements a structured risk management system.

In line with the multiple situations encountered in the field, and while
supporting the Group’s governance bodies, the Strategy and Climate
division shapes the Group's approach to climate change while
working with the operational divisions of the Group’s business
segments. By monitoring indicators, progress can be measured and
the Group's actions can be adjusted.

A) Governance

TOTAL has an organization and structured governance framework to
make sure climate-related challenges are fully integrated into the
Group's strategy. Since September 2016, its organization includes a
Strategy-Innovation corporate division, which includes the Strategy
& Climate division as well as the Gas, Renewables & Power business
segment, whose President is a member of the Executive Committee.

Oversight by the Board of Directors

TOTAL Board of Directors ensures that climate-related issues are
incorporated into the Group's strategy and examines climate change
risks and opportunities during the annual strategic outlook review of
the Group’s business segments.

To carry out its work, the Board of Directors relies on its Strategic &
CSR Committee, whose rules of procedure were changed in
September 2017 then in July 2018 in order to broaden its missions
in the realm of CSR and in questions relating to the inclusion of
climate-related issues in the Group's strategy.

Aware of the importance of climate-change challenges faced by the
Group, the Board of Directors decided, in 2016, to introduce changes
to the variable compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer to take better account of the achievements of Corporate
Social Responsibility (CSR) and the Group's HSE targets. For fiscal
year 2018, the importance given to these criteria rose further: CSR
performance is assessed by considering the extent to which climate
issues are included in the Group's strategy, the Group's reputation in
the domain of Corporate Social Responsibility as well as the policy
concerning all aspects of diversity.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

The Board of Directors meeting of March 13, 2019 decided to change
the criteria for the determination of the variable portion of the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's compensation for the year
2019. Among others, a quantifiable criteria related to the evolution of
GHG emissions (Scopes 1 & 2) on operated oil & gas facilities (refer
to chapter 4, section 4.3.2 for details).

Role of management

TOTAL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in compliance with
the long-term strategic direction set by the Board of Directors,
implements the strategy of the Group and its business segments
while making sure climate change challenges are taken into account.
He relies on the President, Group Strategy-Innovation, who is a
member of the Executive Committee, to whom the Senior Vice
President Strategy & Climate, and the Senior Vice President Climate
report (refer to the Group organization chart in chapter 1). The Senior
Vice President Climate chairs the Climate-Energy steering Committee,
which mainly includes representatives of Strategy and HSE
management from the various business segments. The mission of
this Committee consists of structuring the Group's approach to the
climate.

B) Strategy

Identification of climate-related risks and opportunities

The identification of climate-related risks forms an integral part of the
analysis of investment projects. The impact of these risks is also
examined for the Group asset portfolio as a whole. These risks are
presented in detail in point 3.1.2 of this chapter.

In order to ensure the viability of its projects and long-term strategy
in light of the challenges raised by climate change, the Group
integrates, into the financial evaluation of investments presented to
the Executive Committee, either a long-term CO, price of $30 to $40
per ton (depending on the price of crude), or the actual price of CO,
in a given country if higher.

TOTAL has five major levers to integrate climate in its strategy.

1) Improving energy efficiency

Optimizing the energy consumption of its operated facilities is TOTAL's
first lever to reduce emissions. The Group therefore aims to improve
the energy efficiency of its operated facilities by an average of 1%
per year over the 2010-2020 period, at a time when exploration is
becoming increasingly complex. This indicator is described in point
3. D of this chapter.

TOTAL uses appropriate architectures and equipment and introduces
technological innovations. For example, on offshore production
barges, offshore platforms and onshore facilities, heat recovery
systems at gas turbine exhausts have been implemented thereby
avoiding the need for furnaces or boiler systems.

2) Growing in natural gas

To respond responsibly to the strong rise in demand for electricity,
TOTAL remains committed to gas, whose CO, emissions are half
those of coal when used to generate electricity".

The Group wishes to be present throughout the whole gas chain,
from production to end customer. Significant operations have taken
place in the upstream and the downstream to make this possible.
Upstream, TOTAL has acquired a stake in the giant Yamal LNG
project in the north of Russia. The Group has also acquired the LNG
assets of Engie. These two complementary portfolios allow for the
management of a volume of nearly 40 Mt of LNG as from 2020.
Downstream, the Group has made strategic acquisitions, such as
Direct Energie and Lampiris, gas and electricity suppliers on the
French and Belgian markets, and has developed Total Spring, which
was launched in 2017 on the French market.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

Finally, TOTAL has committed itself to gas fuel for transport by
acquiring a 25% stake in Clean Energy Fuels Corp., one of the
leading distributors of gas fuel for HGVs in the United States, and by
signing a contract with CMA-CGM, the first shipping company to
equip its transcontinental container ships with LNG-powered engines.

Strengthening the position of gas in the energy mix must however be
accompanied by a greater focus on control of methane emissions.
To preserve the advantage that gas offers in terms of GHG emissions
compared to coal for electricity generation, it is necessary to strictly
reduce the methane emissions associated with the production and
transportation of gas. In 2018, TOTAL’s methane emissions are kept
below 0.25% of the commercial gas produced"). TOTAL's target is
to sustainably reduce the intensity of its methane emissions of its
operated facilities in the Exploration & Production segment to less
than 0.20% of commercial gas produced by 2025.

The Group has been a member since 2014 of the partnership
between governments and industrial companies for the improvement
of tools to measure and control methane emissions set up by the
Climate and Clean Air Coalition and promoted by UN Environment
and the non-profit organization Environmental Defense Fund. The
Group also took several actions as part of the Oil & Gas Climate
Initiative and signed the guiding principles on the reduction of
methane emissions on the gas value chain®!.

3) Developing a profitable low-carbon electricity business

TOTAL is developing along the whole of the low-carbon electricity
value chain, from electricity generation, storage and sale to the end
customer. As demand for electricity is expected to grow strongly in
the coming decades, TOTAL intends to become a major player in
this segment. To meet this target, TOTAL plans to invest $1.5 to
$2 billion per year. In 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of
Direct Energie, a French electricity supplier, for nearly €2 billion. With
regards to the generation of electricity, TOTAL aims at holding a
production capacity of 10 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2023.
In 2018, TOTAL acquired four combined-cycle natural gas power
plants in France with a global capacity of 1.6 GW. Refer to chapter 2
for further information on recent acquisitions.

4) Developing sustainable biofuels

A pioneer in biofuels for more than 20 years, TOTAL is now one of
Europe’s major actors with 2.4 Mt blended sustainable biofuels in
2018 for a worldwide distribution of 3.2 Mt.

Furthermore, TOTAL produced 0.1 Mt of sustainable biofuels in its
refineries in 2018. Production at La Méde factory is scheduled to
start in 2019. It has a capacity of 0.5 Mt per year of hydrotreated
vegetable oil (HVO) based on sustainable certified charges, the Group.
intends to reach a market share of over 10% in Europe. Biofuels that
are currently available are mainly made with vegetable oil and sugar.

For more than 10 years, TOTAL’s R&D teams have developed
technologies that have broadened the range of usable resources,
while also meeting the need for sustainability. The consortium BioTFuel
is working on, for example, the development of lignocellulose (plant
waste).

5) Investing in carbon sink businesses

Carbon storage is key to achieving carbon neutrality in the second
half of the 21 century. TOTAL is focusing, on the one hand, on
developing CCUS and, on the other, on preserving and restoring the
capacity of ecosystems to act as carbon sinks. CCUS is vital for
several industries, especially those that emit massive amounts of CO,
due to the nature of their business (cement, steel, etc.). TOTAL
allocates significant resources to this area by dedicating up to 10%
of the Group's R&D budget to it. Several projects have made
substantial progress in recent months. Northern Lights (Norway) is a
project in which the Group participates alongside Equinor and Shell.
TOTAL is also a partner of the Clean Gas Project (UK), together with
the OGCI's investment fund and a few companies of the sector).

TOTAL announced in February 2019 the creation of an entity
dedicated to investments in natural carbon sinks, composed of
experts in environment and agronomy, with an investment budget
$100 million per year from 2020 onwards. Furthermore, actions of
preservation and restoration of the forest are currently conducted
(refer to point 5.9 of chapter 5 where presented the Total Foundation
program carried mainly by the Fondation d'entreprise Total).

Sector initiatives and international framework

TOTAL is also in various sector initiatives on the main challenges
raised by climate change. Indeed, tackling climate change requires
cooperation between all actors, from both public and private sectors.

Thus, in 2014, TOTAL decided to join the call of the UN Global
Compact, which encourages companies to consider a CO, price
internally and publicly support the importance of such a price via
regulation mechanisms suited to the local context. In particular,
TOTAL advocates the emergence of a balanced, progressive
international agreement that prevents the distortion of competition
between industries or regions of the world. Drawing attention to
future constraints on GHG emissions is crucial to changing the energy
mix. TOTAL therefore encourages the setting of a worldwide price
for each ton of carbon emitted, while ensuring fair treatment of
“sectors exposed to carbon leakage” (as defined by the EU). In
addition, TOTAL is working with the World Bank as part of the Carbon
Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC). In June 2017, TOTAL became
a founder member of the Climate Leadership Council, an initiative
that calls for the introduction of a “carbon dividend”, namely, a
redistribution mechanism that would tax the biggest fossil fuel
consumers (a population’s wealthiest citizens) in order to pay a
dividend to the entire population.

In 2014, TOTAL was actively involved in launching and developing
the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), a global industry partnership.
At year-end 2018, this initiative involved 13 major international energy
players. Its purpose is to share experiences, advance technological
solutions and catalyze meaningful action in order to assist the
evolution of the energy mix in a manner that takes into account
climate change issues. Launched in 2017, the OGCI Climate
Investments fund, which has access to over $1 billion over 10 years,
invests in technology that significantly cuts emissions. The fund's
initial investments notably are: a large-scale industrial CO, capture
and storage project (Clean Gas Project); a solution that reduces the
carbon footprint of cement by using CO, instead of water to set
concrete (Solidia Technologies); a high-efficiency opposed-piston
engine that reduces GHG emissions (Achates Power) and a
technology that incorporates CO, as a raw material in the production
of polyols used in polyurethanes, which are plastics that have multiple
uses (Econic Technologies).

Flaring

Reducing routine flaring has been a long-standing target of the Group,
which designs its new projects without resorting to it. In addition,
TOTAL is committed to putting an end to routine flaring of its operated

facilities by 2030. An 80% reduction target was set for 2020
compared to 2010, in other words, an average of 1.5 Mm%/d. This
target has been met since 2017.

Furthermore, as part of the Global Gas Flaring Reduction program,
TOTAL has worked alongside the World Bank for over 10 years to
help producing countries and industrial players control flaring of gas
associated to oil production.

The increase in flaring linked to oil production in 2018 is due to
acquisition and startup of new sites.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

Energy efficiency

One of the Group's performance targets is to better control energy
consumption. Since the beginning of 2013, a Group directive has
defined the requirements to be met at operated sites using more
than 50,000 tons of oil equivalent per year of primary energy
(approximately 40 sites). At end 2018, all the concerned sites reported
compliance or had taken steps to comply with this directive. The aim
is to ensure that 100% sites using more than 50,000 tons of oil
equivalent per year by the end of 2020 have an Energy Management
System auditable, such as the ISO 50001 on energy management").
A certain number of sites that use less energy have, voluntarily, taken
measures to become ISO 50001 certified.

Energy efficiency is a key factor for the improvement of economic,
environmental and industrial performance. Since 2013, the Group
has used a Group Energy Efficiency Index (GEEl) to assess its
performance in this area. It consists of a combination of energy
intensity ratios (ratio of net primary energy consumption to the level
of activity) per business.

The Group's target for the 2010-2020 period is to improve the energy
efficiency of its operated facilities by an average of 1% per year. By
design, the base value of the GEE! was defined as 100 in 2010 and
the target is to reach 90.4 in 2020. This target has been met since
2017.

Through the “Total Ecosolutions” program, the Group is developing
innovative products and services that perform above market
standards on the environmental front. At year-end 2018, 97 products
and services bore the “Total Ecosolutions” label. The CO, eq
emissions avoided throughout the life cycle by the use of “Total
Ecosolutions” products and services, compared to the use of
benchmark products on the market and for an equivalent level of
service, are measured annually based on sales volumes. This
represented 1.75 Mt CO, in 2018.

GHG emissions

The Group has reduced by 25% the GHG emissions produced by its
operated activities since 2010. This reduction was reached thanks to
notably reducing flaring and improving energy efficiency.

In February 2019, TOTAL announced a target to decrease the GHG
emissions (Scopes 1 & 2) on its operated oil & gas facilities to less
than 40 Mt CO,¢e in 2025.

3.5.9.5 Contractors and suppliers

TOTAL's activities generate hundreds of thousands of direct and
indirect jobs worldwide. Present in more than 130 countries, the
Group currently works with a network of more than 100,000 suppliers
of goods and services worldwide. In 2018, the Group's purchases of
goods and services (excluding petroleum products and vessel
chartering by Trading & Shipping) represented approximately
$29 billion! worldwide. The allocation of expenditures on the Group
level is approximately 32% for goods (products, materials, etc.) and
approximately 68% for services (in particular consulting services,
work with supply of materials, transport, etc.).

TOTAL's success as a responsible company is played out all along
its value chain, and the Group is convinced of the importance of
working with suppliers that respect human rights and take care of
their employees. The Group expects its suppliers to adhere to
principles equivalent to those in its own Code of Conduct, as set out
in the Fundamental Principles of Purchasing directive. To this end,
the Group wanted the management of its supplier relations to be
coordinated by the dedicated cross-functional “Total Global
Procurement” entity, which is tasked, in particular, with delivering
Purchasing services and assisting the Group's entities and sites,
mainly in Exploration & Production, Refining & Petrochemicals,
Marketing & Services and Gas, Renewables & Power. This approach
is complemented by employee training programs and actions to raise
awareness amongst the Group’s partners, customers and suppliers.
Its success is also based on TOTAL involvement in international
initiatives or collaborative approaches specific to the energy sector
that promote the emergence of good practices.

A) The Group’s responsible procurement policy

The Group ensures that contractual conditions are negotiated in an
equitable manner with its suppliers. The Code of Conduct restates
this requirement and the three essential principles that guide TOTAL’s
relations with its suppliers: dialogue, professionalism and the
fulfillment of commitments.

These principles are also set forth in the Fundamental Principles of
Purchasing, launched in 2010, that specify the commitments that
TOTAL expects its employees and suppliers to adhere to in the
following areas: respect for human rights at work, the protection of
health, safety and security, preservation of the environment,
prevention of corruption, and conflicts of interest and the fight against
fraud, respect for competition law, as well as the promotion of
economic and social development. These principles were drawn up
in keeping with the fundamental principles defined in particular in the
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
conventions of the International Labor Organization, the United
Nations Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises.

Furthermore, a Sustainable Procurement road map defines TOTAL’s
guidelines in this area. A Sustainable Procurement Committee
regularly brings together the Management Committee of Total Global
Procurement and the Civil Society Engagement (including the Human
Rights Department), HSE and Legal divisions as well as the Ethics
Committee. It is tasked with monitoring the implementation of the
Group's Sustainable Procurement road map.

Employee awareness-raising actions and training

TOTAL has set up a number of channels of communication to raise
employee awareness of the risks and issues related to its supply
chain. Training modules explaining the Group's ethical commitments.
and the Fundamental Principles of Purchasing have been developed
for and made available to Group procurement representatives. In
2018, 196 procurement representatives were trained on respect of
human rights and working conditions by suppliers, and 250 on
anti-corruption rules.

The Group provides its procurement representatives with supporting
materials, such as the “Sustainable Purchasing Awareness Cards”
that recap human rights at work and identify the purchaser practices
that must alert them. A set of communication tools intended to help
procurement representatives to enter discussions on the Fundamental
Principles of Purchasing was also distributed within Total Global
Procurement. The materials used in the annual performance review
have been revised to include a section on human rights.

In June 2018, the International Procurement Days brought together
the 170 procurement representatives present in 41 countries. The
Fundamental Principles of Purchasing were distributed during the
event and the internal supplier qualification and audit processes were
presented.

With respect to the development of good practices in business
relations, TOTAL also launched an initiative to raise its employees’
awareness of mediation as an alternative method for resolving
disputes. Since 2013, a training day run by professional mediators to
raise awareness of mediation has been organized in French and
English. In 2017, an open day for employees of the Group, lawyers
and suppliers, enabled participants to learn about the benefits of
mediation. A brochure designed to increase awareness of the
mediation process is available to all Group employees. In addition,
an email address is available on the Group website (under “Suppliers”).
The Group's suppliers can contact the internal supplier mediator
using a generic email address (mediation.fournisseurs@total.com).
The internal mediator is tasked with facilitating relations between the
Group and its French and international suppliers. The general
purchasing terms and conditions also mention the possibility of
recourse to mediation.

B) Extension of the Group’s policy to the supply chain
TOTAL expects its suppliers to:

— _ adhere to the Fundamental Principles of Purchasing and ensure
that they are adhered to in their activities;

— _ accept to be audited according to these principles;

— remain attentive to the everyday working conditions of their
employees and their suppliers’ employees;

— ensure that their own suppliers and subcontractors adhere to
these Fundamental Principles of Purchasing;

— refer to the Group Ethics Committee when in doubt or in the
event of any malfunction.

The rules set out in these Principles must be included or transposed
into the agreements concluded with suppliers. To this end, these
Principles are available for consultation by all suppliers in both French
and English on TOTAL's website (under “Suppliers”).

The supplier qualification process

The supplier qualification process was harmonized at Group level in
2017 by Total Global Procurement. A new internal framework was.
published in 2018. A new computerized qualification tool will gradually
be rolled out starting in 2019, with a planned scope of 107 countries
thus far.

It will be used to automate and document the supplier qualification
process, which unfolds in four stages:

1. confirmation of interest;

2. a risk pre-analysis to decide whether an in-depth analysis of
each criterion is necessary (HSE, anti-corruption, societal,
financial, technical);

3. determination of the qualification status;

4. monitoring and renewal of qualification. Qualifications are valid
for three years.

The supplier assessment process

Simultaneously, the Group has set up a supplier assessment process.
to identify and prevent risks of severe impacts on human rights and
fundamental freedoms, human health and safety. Thus, since 2016,
the Group started conducting campaigns to audit working conditions
amongst its suppliers. These audits are conducted by a specialized
service provider, with which TOTAL signed a framework contract in
2016.

Since 2017, the Group has been rolling-out specific training for Group
purchasers to evaluate suppliers with respect to human rights.

Moreover, in September 2018, TOTAL, BP, Equinor and Shell
announced their intention to develop a common collaborative
approach to assess the respect of human rights by their suppliers.
The partner companies are convinced of the importance of working
with suppliers that respect human rights, on the one hand, and take
good care of their employees, on the other. The goal of this common
approach is to encourage the improvement of working conditions in
the supply chain of the companies involved. This initiative addresses
the United Nations SDG N° 8: “to promote sustained, inclusive and
sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and
decent work for all”.

RISKS AND CONTROL

Risk Factors

Supplier awareness-raising actions

The deployment of the anti-corruption policy in purchasing continued
in 2017 with awareness-raising sessions for strategic suppliers at
the Suppliers Day. This event gathered more than 100 suppliers that
are considered to be strategic in view of their contribution to Group
operations. In addition to numerous initiatives taken in previous years,
in 2018 approximately 229 suppliers underwent an anti-corruption
analysis through the issuing of specific questionnaires, completed, in
some cases, by external inspections.

Every year, one of the departments of the IPO (TOTAL IPO in
Shanghai, China) organizes a compliance day and invites one of its
approved suppliers. It can explain the actions it takes regarding
anti-corruption compliance, the concrete problems encountered and
how it deals with them. The discussions, based on case studies and
topical issues, are enlightening for all. In 2018, this event was held in
December (refer also to point 5.8.1 of chapter 5).

Finally, pursuant to Rule 13p-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, which implemented certain provisions of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010, TOTAL has submitted since 2014 to the SEC an annual
document relating to “conflict minerals" sourced from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. The
document indicates whether, during the preceding calendar year,
any such minerals were necessary to the functionality or production
of a product manufactured (or contracted to be manufactured) by
the TOTAL S.A. or one of its affiliates had. The main objective of the
rule’s obligation to publish this information is to prevent the direct or
indirect funding of armed groups in central Africa. For more
information, refer to TOTAL’s most recent publication available at:
sustainable-performance.total.com or www.sec.gov.

C) The Group’s responsible procurement commitments

Since 2010, TOTAL is a signatory to the French Economy and
Finances Ministry's Sustainable Supplier Relations Charter, which
aims to allow more sustainable and balanced relations between
customers and suppliers.

Worldwide, a CSR global agreement monitoring Committee (known
as the “FAIR Committee") meets every year in the presence of
representatives who are members of trade unions affiliated with the
IndustriALL Global Union and appointed by this federation to monitor
and implement the agreement. It identifies good practice and areas
for improvement. In application of the areas for improvement defined
by this Committee, the programs mentioned earlier have already
been set up: Suppliers Day, International Procurement Day and
trainings in human rights for purchasers.

Since 2018, TOTAL has been a member of the United Nations Global
Compact platform on Decent Work in Global Supply Chains, and, in
this capacity, takes part in various workshops that aim to help the
member companies of the Global Compact to make progress in this
area. In December 2018, the Group committed to pursuing its efforts
in terms of decent work and respecting human rights in its supply
chain by signing the “Six Commitments” of the United Nations Global
Compact.

The Group's buyers also take part in international working groups on
responsible procurement. TOTAL is an active member of IPIECA’s
Supply Chain Working Group. Building on the workshops held since
2015, TOTAL continued to participate in the Operationalization of the
UN Guiding Principles work organized by the IPIECA, aimed at both
cil and gas companies and engineering, procurement and construction
(EPC) contractors.

Finally, the Group pays special attention to the disabled and protected
employment sectors. In France, the Group's purchases from this
sector enabled the achievement of an indirect employment rate of
nearly 1% in 2018. TOTAL is a member of the Pas@Pas association
and provides its buyers with an online directory that can be used to
identify potential suppliers and service providers (disabled or
protected employment sectors) by geographical area and by category
(refer to point 5.3.5.3 in chapter 5).

(1) Rule 13p-1 defines “confit minerals” as follows (irrespective of their geographical origin): columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, gold, wolframite as well as their derivatives, which are

limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten.
