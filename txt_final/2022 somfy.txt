MANAGEMENT REPORT

TO THE COMBINED GENERAI

MEETING

OF 17 APRIL 2023

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions, the Board of Directors has convened you here in order to inform you on the management
of your company and its subsidiaries and to submit for your approval the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.
Founded in 1969 in France, and now operating in 58 countries, SOMFY is the world leader in window and door automation for homes and
buildings. Pioneer in the connected home, the Group is constantly innovating to guarantee its users comfort, well-being, and security in the
home and is fully committed to promoting sustainable development. For more than 50 years, SOMFY has been using automation to improve
living environments and has been committed to creating reliable and sustainable solutions that promote better living and well-being for all.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

SIMPLIFIED PUBLIC TENDER OFFER FOR THE SHARES
OF SOMFY

On 15 November 2022, SOMFYSA was informed of a draft
Simplified Public Tender Offer for its shares, intended to strengthen
the Despature family group’s control over the company. The family
group already owned 73.9% of SOMFY’s share capital and 84.2% of
its theoretical voting rights, and sought to delist the company. This
Offer, which applied to a maximum of 7,551,738 shares, was fully
aligned with the Group’s strategic and operational development
and reaffirmed the principal shareholder’s intention to support the
Group’s long-term business growth.

The Offer, jointly initiated by J.P.J.S. and JP 3 (“the Initiators”), was
priced at €143 per share, representing a premium of 38.5% above
the volume-weighted average share price over the previous 60
trading days and a premium of 20.6% above the last closing price
before the Offer was announced, thus offering shareholders a
significant premium relative to the recent market track record of
SOMFY shares.

On 7 December 2022, the Board of Directors issued a reasoned
opinion on the Offer and stated that said Offer and its implications
were in line with the interests of the Group, its shareholders and
employees, and recommended that the company’s shareholders
tender their shares to the Offer.

This opinion was issued unanimously following — the
recommendations of the ad hoc committee, comprised of three
independent members, and the findings of the report — including a
fairness opinion on the financial terms of the Offer — submitted by
the independent appraiser Finexsi, appointed upon the proposal of
this committee.

The AMF declared the Offer compliant on 20 December 2022 and
published the notice announcing the opening of the Offer on
21 December 2022, with the Offer period running from
22 December 2022 to 12 January 2023.

SOMFY ~ ANNUAL REPORT 2022

Following the transaction, since the free float accounted for less
than 10% of the company’s share capital and voting rights, a
squeeze-out was conducted and the remaining shares were
acquired in February 2023. This squeeze-out constitutes a
subsequent event. At the date of preparation of this report, shares
in the company have been delisted from Euronext Paris.

SYNDICATED LOAN

Alongside the structuring of the financial package that enabled the
J.P.J.S. and JP 3 holding companies to make the Simplified Public
Tender Offer, on 16December 2022 SOMFYSA took out a
€300 million syndicated loan over five years in the form of a revolving
credit facility from its main financial partners. This facility replaced
the bilateral borrowing facilities still in place with certain banks.

An extension of the syndicate to include new partners and increase
the amount of the revolving credit facility by €50 million is currently
being set up and should be finalised in the first half-year of 2023.
This extension constitutes a subsequent event.

RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN CRISIS

The war between Russia and Ukraine has been ongoing since
24 February 2022. It has led to the displacement of huge numbers of
the Ukrainian population to neighbouring countries and sanctions
against Russia by the international community, caused a sharp rise
in energy prices and exacerbated the semi-conductor crisis. SOMFY
is closely monitoring developments in the Russian-Ukrainian
conflict, stopped its exports to Russia at the start of the crisis and
has implemented measures to protect its employees and assets in
these territories, which account for less than 1% of the Group’s
sales. It is difficult at this stage to assess its repercussions on the
economy in general and on the Group’s business in particular.
Within this uncertain environment, potential asset impairment of
approximately €3.4 million has been measured by SOMFY, for which
provision has been made at 31 December 2022.

PRESSURE ON PROCUREMENT

The Group has continued to face an increase in the price of raw
materials, transportation and electronic components against a
backdrop of shortage of the latter (disruption exacerbated by the
resurgence of Covid-19 in Asia, notably blocking the port of
Shanghai, and by the war in Ukraine). To manage procurement
difficulties, SOMFY has maintained the dedicated crisis unit and
has pursued its strategy of redesigning its products. These
measures have helped to reduce delivery backlogs.

ACQUISITION OF AN INTEREST IN FRENCH GROUP
ELCIA

On 14 April 2022, SOMFY acquired a 6.33% stake in the share
capital of Elcia, the French leader for configurators and software
for the windows, doors, roller shutters and shading systems sector,
for €5 million. This acquisition was financed from SOMFY’s existing
cash resources and has been recognised as a non-consolidated
equity investment pursuant to IFRS9, since SOMFY does not
exercise any significant influence over Elcia.

Sharing common values based on innovation and customer service,
SOMFY and Elcia seek to establish this partnership to pursue the
dual aim of helping Elcia Group to expand in Europe, in particular
in Germany, and supporting trade installers with the sale of
connected solutions.

With 230 employees and more than 24,000 users of ProDevis, the
number 1 costing and management solution for installers in
windows, doors, roller shutters and shading systems, a solution
aimed at optimising interaction between manufacturers, their
sales networks and residential customers, Elcia Group generated
sales of €27 million in 2022.

ACQUISITION OF ITALIAN GROUP TELECO
AUTOMATION

On 4 July 2022, SOMFY acquired a 75% stake in the share capital of
Italian group Teleco Automation, a specialist in automation,
control and lighting systems for indoor and outdoor residential
equipment. The Group financed the acquisition using existing cash
resources. The acquisition cost was €146 million and the
agreement comes with put and call options relating to the balance
of Teleco Automation’s share capital exercisable in early 2025.
Teleco Automation has been fully consolidated in the Group’s
financial statements since 1 July 2022.

This acquisition will enable SOMFY to benefit from the Italian
group’s expertise and innovation capacity in the automation of
solar protection equipment for terraces, particularly pergolas and
awnings, in order to accelerate the development of its core
business and support the digitalisation of outdoor living equipment.

02 MANAGEMENT REPORT

Founded in 1996 and operating in about 40 countries, Teleco
Automation showed dynamic growth, had 102 employees, and
contributed €18.0 million to the Group’s sales and €0.8 million to
its current operating result in the year to 31 December 2022.

CHANGES TO THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE

Apart from the transaction mentioned above, there were no
material changes to the consolidation scope during the 2022
financial year.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The proceedings brought against SOMFY SA by Spirel employees
before the regional court of Albertville have been closed since
23 June 2021, the employees’ appeal to the highest Court of
Appeal having been rejected. In a decision dated 3 May 2022, the
Arbitrating Judge of the Labour Court of Albertville dismissed the
claim brought by the employees challenging their redundancy and
seeking compensation of an amount substantially identical to the
amount sought in the proceedings before the regional court
(€8.2 million). The proceedings before the Labour Court of
Albertville had already been dismissed in 2016 and 2018. Certain
employees appealed that decision and the proceedings are thus
still ongoing.

The Group continues to qualify the risk as a contingent liability and
no provision was recognised at 31 December 2022.

In a ruling of 17 December 2021, the Paris Commercial Court had
dismissed all claims brought by Alder Holdings SAS (formerly United
Technologies Holdings SAS) in its case against SOMFY SA concerning
the disposal of CIAT shares in 2015. For reference, Alder Holdings
was claiming a total of €18.4 million from the sellers of the CIAT
shares (of which SOMFY’s portion would have been €8.5 million)
under the liability guarantee, in connection with complaints fully
contested by the sellers, and also remained liable for deferred
payments. In early 2022, Alder Holdings appealed the ruling of
17 December 2021, thus blocking the €10 million held in escrow yet
to be received by the sellers (of which €4.3 million for SOMFY).
Under mediation proceedings led by the Paris Court of Appeal,
SOMFY SA and Alder Holdings entered into an agreement on
30 September 2022 to bring the dispute to a close. Under this
agreement, the sellers will pay compensation of €3.5 million to
Alder Holdings (of which €1.3 million to be paid by SOMFY SA), to
be deducted from the escrow account, the remaining balance of
which will be released in full (of which €2.9 million for SOMFY SA).
Proceedings were fully completed as at 31 December 2022. The
impacts recognised by SOMFY SA in 2022 consist of a €2.2 million
inflow in respect of deferred payments, a €2.9 million inflow in
respect of the balance of the purchase price and a non-current loss
of €1.6 million including other costs.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PARENT COMPANY DATA

Over the year ended 31 December 2022, SOMFY SA generated
sales of €4.6 million. Net financial income amounted to
€236.1 million, including €241.3 million in dividends paid by the
subsidiaries in respect of their net profit for the year to
31 December 2021.

Net profit was €225.5 million, after inclusion of a tax income of
€2.1 million.

CONSOLIDATED DATA

SALES

Group sales were €1.5 billion for the 2022 financial year, an
increase of 3.7% compared with the previous financial year (up
1.6% on a like-for-like basis). They posted growth of 4.3% over the
first half-year, and a fall of 1.6% over the second on a like-for-like
basis, confirming the slowdown seen since the second quarter of
2022.

SOMFY ~ ANNUAL REPORT 2022

02 MANAGEMENT REPORT

During the 2022 financial year, the Latin America, Africa & the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions posted significant growth,
demonstrating the benefits of the Group’s international footprint. Impacted by economic and geopolitical tensions, the Eastern Europe,
Northern Europe and Central Europe regions all recorded slowdowns whilst France and North America remained stable, reflecting the
strength of the Group’s fundamentals and positive structural trends in the residential market.

The positive forex impact stood at €12 million for the financial year, with the scope impact at €18 million corresponding to the contribution
of Teleco Automation, consolidated since 1 July 2022.

Sales of the equity-accounted Chinese subsidiary Dooya totalled €297 million over the financial year, an increase of 7.6% in real terms and
stable, with a 0.2% decline on a like-for-like basis, which included growth of 22.4% over the first half-year and a decline of 17.1% over the

second, given a fourth quarter that was heavily impacted by the management of the pandemic in China.

SOMFY has adjusted its Latin America and Africa & the Middle East sales figures to reflect the effects of hyperinflation in Argentina and
Turkey by -€0.04 million and +€0.29 million respectively (see note 2.2.2 to the consolidated financial statements).

RESULTS

Current operating result stood at €278 million over the financial
year, a decline of 7.6%, equating to a current operating margin of
18.2%, lower than those recorded in 2020 and 2021 — which stood
at abnormally high levels of 20.7% and 20.4% respectively — but
higher than that seen in pre-Covid periods (17.1% in 2019).

Current operating result was impacted by the slowdown in sales,
the significant rise in the price of raw materials and transportation
costs, and the maintaining of the Group’s structuring projects,
reflected in an increase in related structure costs, and the upturn
in certain expenses (travel, marketing).

Non-recurring expenses increased, related to the Russian-Ukrainian
crisis and the expenses related to the acquisition of Teleco
Automation. Net financial expense was higher due to forex impacts,
and the income tax rate was comparable to that seen in the
previous financial year. Given Dooya’s healthy performance, the
share of net profit from associates and joint ventures grew by
€8 million and totalled €25 million.

Consolidated net profit totalled €238 million over the financial
year, a decline of 8.1%.

SOMFY ~ ANNUAL REPORT 2022

The return on capital employed (ROCE) stood at 20.5%, similar to
the level seen in 2019 (22.2%). Note that it was 31.4% in 2021.

FINANCIAL POSITION

Shareholders’ equity increased from €1,371 to €1,485 million over
the 2022 financial year. Net financial surplus declined from €642 to
€428 million, mainly as a result of the recent acquisition of Teleco
Automation and the increase in inventory, in light of lower sales
and the Group’s desire to rebuild its safety stock, with a knock-on
impact on working capital requirements. Cash flow declined by
8.9% in line with profits.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

The change N/N-1 on a like-for-like basis, current operating
margin, ROCE and net financial debt are Alternative Performance
Measures (APMs), definitions and calculation details of which are
included in note 4.3 to the consolidated financial statements.

STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE

During the 2022 financial year, the SOMFY SA share price decreased by 18.8%. At 31 December 2021, the last trading day representing the
closing day of the previous financial year, the share was worth €176.20 and was listed at €143 on 30 December 2022, representing the price
proposed by the initiators of the Simplified Public Tender Offer for SOMFY shares (see Highlights). Over the same period the CAC 40 and
SBF 120 indexes decreased by 9.5% and 10.3% respectively. SOMFY joined the SBF 120 index on 16 September 2022 and exited it on
9 February 2023 when its shares were delisted from Euronext Paris following the implementation of the squeeze-out (see Post-balance
sheet events). Trading in the SOMFY share was suspended on 13 January 2023 after the Simplified Public Tender Offer ended and did not
resume before its delisting.

In 2022, the market for the share recorded a monthly trading volume high of 935,870 and low of 130,282, with a monthly average of
337,546 shares, compared with 182,909 shares the previous year.

POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS

SIMPLIFIED PUBLIC TENDER OFFER AND SQUEEZE-OUT

As noted under Highlights, the Simplified Public Tender Offer ended on 12 January 2023 and a total of 5,020,213 shares were tendered
during the Offer period, with the result that the Despature family group held 87.47% of SOMFY’s share capital and 92.06% of its voting
rights following the Offer.

Since those shares not tendered to the Offer accounted for less than 10% of the share capital and voting rights, the Despature family group
decided on 30 January 2023 to conduct a squeeze-out of SOMFY shares not tendered to the Offer at a price of €143 per share.

The squeeze-out and the delisting of SOMFY shares from the Euronext Paris market took effect on 9 February 2023.

EXTENSION OF SYNDICATE AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

As noted under Highlights, the extension of the syndicate is currently being set up and should be finalised in the first half-year of 2023 to
include new partners and increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by €50 million.

OUTLOOK

Following the Simplified Public Tender Offer initiated by the Despature family group, the implementation of the squeeze-out and the
delisting of SOMFY shares from the regulated Euronext Paris market took place on 9 February 2023.

This transaction does not call into question the Group’s strategic plan, and it continued rolling out its roadmap while remaining vigilant to
the still very uncertain macro-economic and geopolitical environment against the backdrop of the global economic slowdown.

02 MANAGEMENT REPORT

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

PRESENTATION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

GOVERNANCE AND LEADING PLAYERS

The Group’s internal control and risk management system covers all the controlled companies that fall within the Group’s consolidation
scope, apart from equity-accounted companies, notably Dooya, which has its own system, in which the Group is involved in particular
through the creation of a dedicated Audit Committee, presence on the Dooya Board and support in line with needs.

At Group level, the system has been developed around the three lines of defence model, ensuring the effective Division of roles and

responsibilities.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

GROSS RISK

The first line of defence, operational units

NET RISK

The second line of defence, Functional Departments

The Group’s operational units have been made aware of the need
for compliance with rules and procedures in order to establish an
effective first line of control.

Each Group entity must implement appropriate control activities at
operational level in relation to the processes that concern it, by
applying the rules and guidelines developed at Group level.

SOMFY ~ ANNUAL REPORT 2022

Functional Departments represent an essential link in the second
line of control. Each of these Departments sets out the procedures
to be applied and offers their support to the Group’s entities in
relation to the implementation of action plans aimed at reducing
the risks identified.

The second line of control also includes the Risk Management &
Compliance and Internal Control functions, specifically responsible
for leading an overall Group approach in order to ensure all risks
are properly identified and addressed.


--- Page 6 ---

The third line of defence, Internal Audit Department

The Internal Audit Department oversees the overall monitoring of
the quality of risk management, the relevance and effectiveness of
the monitoring system as well as compliance with rules and codes
of conduct. It is responsible for assessing how well the internal
control system works and for proposing recommendations for
improvement if needed.

Internal audits of the Group are conducted under the supervision
of the Internal Audit Manager who relies on a team made up of
two auditors, with an average of 20 assignments per year.
Following each assignment, and based on the recommendations
issued by the auditors, action plans are prepared by the entities
concerned to correct the shortcomings highlighted by the audit
reports.

A summary of these recommendations is presented to General
Management and to the Audit and Risk Committee every quarter.

GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) solution

In order to perform their coordination and management role, the

Internal Control, Risk and Compliance Department and the Internal

Audit Department have a shared GRC solution, which specifically

allows them to:

— initiate a self-assessment campaign for subsidiaries each year,
based on a framework of key controls;

— monitor all the assignments of Internal Audit, as well as the
related recommendations and the corresponding action plans;

— assess the Group’s risks at several levels in the organisation,
consolidate the results at Group level and link them with action
plans.

Since 2021, this system has also been used to collect from the

Group entities concerned, the indicators mentioned in the

non-financial statement.

Moreover, a digital accounting controls solution is used to support

the internal control and audit assignments.

The use of all these resources is closely monitored by the Audit

and Risk Committee, which is regularly informed of the progress

achieved and the results obtained.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group’s risk management includes all the resources, processes

and initiatives that aim to identify, assess and control the Group’s

risks in reference to its strategic objectives.

Group Management firmly believes that risk management and

control contributes to:

— creating and preserving the value, assets and reputation of the
Group;

— securing the Group’s decision-making and processes to facilitate
the achievement of targets;

— encouraging actions that are consistent with the Group’s values;

— raising employee awareness and bringing them together around
a shared vision concerning the risks inherent in their activity.

A Group risk framework has been established to be able to

formally set out and consolidate the assessments of each scope

and function. The assessment stage involves examining the

potential consequences of the main risks identified (consequences

that may in particular be financial, human, legal or reputational)

and to assess their likelihood of occurring.

The Group has adopted standard methodology for assessing risks

enabling the assessment of inherent (gross) risks and residual (net)

02 MANAGEMENT REPORT

risks based on a standard and consistent rating allowing the
impacts, likelihood of occurrence and level of control to be graded.
These assessments mean that the Group’s risks can be mapped
and updated every year by the Risk and Compliance Department.
This mapping is ratified by the Executive Committee which
undertakes to monitor the main risks identified. An owner is
appointed for each priority risk and is responsible for proposing
action plans for the handling of that risk. Monitoring these risks is
incorporated into the monthly review cycles of the Executive
Committee.

Mapping also helps with the development of the annual audit plan,
as the audit team is responsible for challenging the assessment of
certain risks and for proposing recommendations to reduce them.

INTERNAL CONTROL

Definition and objectives

The internal control system is implemented to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the achievement of objectives by contributing
to the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, to the reliability
of the financial reports and to compliance with applicable laws and
regulations.

The Group’s internal
framework.

control system draws on the COSO

Controls and assessments

A framework of key controls has been defined for each of the
business’s major processes and is used during an annual
self-assessment process by each entity Manager.

An annual review of this framework is conducted in order to
update it, facilitate its understanding by all subsidiaries and tailor it
to the level of internal control maturity acquired. Each of these
controls addresses one or more risks in the Group’s inventory of
risks. Certain controls are related to processes that are also
updated if necessary.

In 2022, desk and on-site audits of the self-assessment completed
by the entities were conducted by the Internal Control
Department, to challenge answers and improve the understanding
and application of controls.

Internal control monitoring

The Internal Control Department notably conducts two types of

monitoring:

— an analysis of the results of the self-assessment process for
internal controls for Year N and a comparison with Year N-1;

— a quarterly dashboard monitoring the action plans for each of
the Group’s major functions, enabling their progress to be
measured.

These documents are notably sent to the Business Area Managers

and the Heads of Processes for observation of development,

deviations and implementation deadlines.

Certain improvements are directly addressed by entities at a local

level, while others are looked into centrally by the Internal Control

Department and/or in collaboration with other cross-Group

functions.

A GRC Committee meets every two months to discuss the risks

identified and the audit assignments carried out, analyse incidents,

identify deviations and suggest adjustments to the overall system.

SOMFY ~ ANNUAL REPORT 2022

02 MANAGEMENT REPORT

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM RELATING TO THE PROCESS
FOR PREPARING ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Control measures relating to the process for preparing accounting
and financial information are detailed below in response to the
objective of reliability in financial reporting.

Preparation of financial statements

The Group has defined a unique and common framework for the
recording of accounting and financial information. It resulted in the
definition and implementation within all subsidiaries of a Group
chart of accounts, as well as the definition and implementation of
the main management procedures (inventories, non-current
assets, trade receivables, etc.), which are formalised in the Group
Procedure Manual relayed through and updated on the Group’s
intranet.

The Group’s various ERPs thus include standard configuration
concerning in particular the accounting plan and analytical
monitoring, enabling the application of Group processes.
Furthermore, the proper application of the chart of accounts and
procedures, and reporting reliability are monitored within the
context of year-end and half-year closing. Other controls take
place during the budget preparation and monthly reporting
processes.

Particular care is taken with risk analysis, through a review of asset
provisions and provisions for liabilities and charges, as well as
off-balance sheet commitments.

Financial statements control

The Consolidation Department, after verifying the completeness of
financial information, the proper application of closing procedures
and restatements, the intragroup account reconciliations and the
net equity justification, performs financial statement consolidation
using dedicated software.

RISK FACTORS

MAIN RISKS.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with IFRS. In addition, accounting options selected are presented
to and approved by the Audit and Risk Committee.

Financial communication

After the half-year and annual financial statements have been
approved by the Board of Directors, they are published in a report
available on the Group’s website (www.somfyfinance.com).

Since 9 February 2023, SOMFY is no longer listed (see Highlights)
and is therefore no longer required to publish regulated
information. Relevant information relating to the company’s
business activities is presented to the Audit and Risk Committee.

Treasury management

The Group Treasury Department reports to the Group’s Head of

Accounting, Consolidation and Treasury.

A Treasury Committee meeting is held each month with the Chief

Financial Officer. The role of this Committee is twofold:

— strategic: to define the overall policy in terms of Group Cash
Management, financing, and interest rate, exchange rate and
investment risk management. They also include the follow-up of
Group subsidiaries’ equity balance sheet items;

— operational: to guarantee the regular monitoring of Group Cash
Management's actions and audits of third-party suppliers. These
are detailed in a monthly dashboard.

A Group Treasury Charter defines best practices and lists in a single

document the guidelines that ensure the secure, economical and

efficient management of financing and deposit operations, and
more generally of cash management and bank relations within the

Group.

An e-learning module based on the Treasury Charter and raising

the financial community's awareness of fraud risks is available in

the training catalogue. It is compulsory for all the Group’s financial
population as well as for individuals who are signatories on the
banking platforms.

Amid the current environment of high market volatility and successive crises, in 2022 it was important for SOMFY to complete its annual
review of operational risks through consideration of its strategic risks, which could potentially call into question its strategy or the
attainment of its strategic objectives. The consolidated vision below therefore presents the internal and external threats likely to have a
negative effect on the Group’s financial position, results, activities and outlook.

A more detailed vision of risks also exists internally, so that each of the risks defined as being key are addressed by action plans, led by the
operational staff responsible, and overseen by a member of the Executive Committee. The risks detailed include risks more specifically
related to the Group’s environmental, social and societal activities. They are presented in the non-financial statement on pages 40 to 42.

A malicious intrusion into the Group’s IT systems could result in the partial or total
unavailability of these systems, the partial or total cessation of operations, damage to data
integrity or data theft.

Technical dependency

A lack of alternatives for certain technologies or a lack of supply diversification for certain
components could result in the Group being dependent on a number of suppliers.

Economic volatility

A volatile economic environment could make it difficult to anticipate and react to uncertainties
in the various markets in which the Group operates, which could lead to a decline in sales, a
deterioration of margins or an increase in costs and doubtful debts.

Geopolitical/Country
instability

q

Political instability in certain geographies and numerous geopolitical conflicts or tensions could
impact the Group’s operational and commercial efficiency, and result in a need to adjust its
manufacturing, logistics, supply and/or distribution footprint.

JV strategy and governance

The lack of operational, technical and commercial synergies in relation to the Group’s JVs could
affect the optimal leverage and implementation of the opportunities envisioned at the time of
the acquisition.

Digital maturity

<9

The lack of investment or insufficient acceleration of process digitalisation and data
governance projects could deprive SOMFY of catalysts for its internal operational efficiency, as
well as externally, including customer support (loyalty, customer journey, differentiated service
offers and value proposition).

R10 Innovation leadership

Not being the market leader in terms of innovation and being recognised as such,
(time-to-market, patenting, new functionalities, new services, differentiating offers) could
leave the door open to competition and generate market share erosion over time.

retention and their commitment over the long term, and could generate a loss of operational efficiency

and additional costs.

Failure to take into account, or insufficiently take into account, the impacts of the
Transformation program transformation programme (change management, skills development, cultural evolution,
execution monitoring of plans and investments) on the Group’s processes, organisation and teams could
hinder the programme’s proper execution.

Failure to turn the Group’s CSR strategy into a strategic advantage, through significant
investments, persuasive external communication on the added value of SOMFY solutions and
ongoing team commitment, could constitute missed business opportunities and result in a
failure to achieve Ambition 2030.

CSR strategy failure

Pressure in the recruitment markets and the changing expectations of candidates could make it
difficult to recruit new talent in certain geographical areas and in certain professions. Failure to
take into account the Group’s international environment could prevent SOMFY from benefiting
from the diversity of multi-cultural profiles, both in terms of interpersonal relations and from
an operational point of view.

People diversity
& attractiveness

The arrival of new players, more agile, more digital or with more disruptive business models
New incomers than SOMFY, could weaken the Group’s current distribution model and could ultimately
challenge its position as market leader.

A technological breakthrough, marketed by another player and liable to replace SOMFY

Technology disruption solutions, could potentially result in significant financial losses for the Group.

Integration processes that are insufficiently robust, including in terms of alignment of
procedures and IT and financial systems, as well as in terms of strategy and synergies, could
prevent the Group from achieving the expected results and could generate additional
unanticipated costs, more complex and less efficient operational processes and a less
homogeneous corporate culture.

Inefficient integration
process

Failure to comply with local and international laws and regulations, due to insufficient
Failure in legal and knowledge or unethical behaviour by Group employees, could result in heavy fines being
regulatory requirements imposed on the Group, in criminal sanctions for its managers and in damage to SOMFY’s
reputation.

Quality issues affecting SOMFY products and services (whether related to internal or supplier
failures) could negatively impact operations and render us unable to maintain customer
satisfaction. This could lead to product recalls, generating high costs and damaging the Group’s
image.

Quality crisis

Standards and regulations are constantly evolving and their pressure tends to increase,
including in SOMFY’s field. While their impact is more of an opportunity (contribution of its
solutions to the energy efficiency of buildings), they can also impact its product range
(substances, standby consumption, radio waves).

R21 Regulations impacts

Insufficiently prepared succession plans for senior management or key positions in the
company could lead to short-term or long-term disorganisation, loss of expertise, and
potentially a decline in business and additional costs due to inefficiency and unplanned
recruitment.

R22. Succession planning

Amongst the issues identified in 2022, certain topics emerged more strongly due to the economic and geopolitical environment, such as
resilience in the event of market pressures or a sudden and unexpected stoppage in business (overall Supply Chain, cyber-attack, economic
volatility, exposure to country risk) but also issues related to market changes (new needs, increased competition, product range strategy)
within a less favourable economic environment. Legal developments and challenges related to social and societal responsibility represent
opportunities for SOMFY, which can demonstrate how its products and solutions contribute to these issues, although certain regulations
can lead to the requirement to improve the design of certain products.

In addition, making processes digital and managing data remain a major challenge in which the Group has invested heavily for several years,
notably with the roll-out of a new ERP (SAP - So! One project).

Lastly, risks related to human resources must be taken into account carefully. To deliver its ambitious transformation programme, SOMFY
must both accompany change and protect its key resources, by developing their skills and promoting their mobility, while simultaneously
attracting new talents within a challenging recruitment climate.

In 2023, there will be a specific focus on formally setting out and implementing action plans aimed at mitigating the main risks identified. It
will be managed by the Risk and Compliance Department and will report to the Executive Committee on a regular basis. Group
Management firmly believes that the management and control of risks and the ongoing improvement of processes have contributed to the
Group’s performance and to the fulfilment of the strategy.

OTHER NON-MATERIAL RISKS

These “non-material” risks are found at a controlled level or are
not necessarily specific to the Group.

Financial risks

A description of the financial risks (Foreign exchange risk, Interest
rate risk, Liquidity risk, Credit risk, Raw material risk, Customer
credit risk) and the policies applied to mitigate their occurrence
are covered by a detailed presentation in notes 4.5 and 7.3 of the
consolidated financial statements chapter.

Equity risk

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury shares. Given the
share price, it was not necessary to record a provision for
writedown at 31 December 2022.

Legal risks

The Group’s operations are not subject to specific regulations. Its
activities do not require specific legal or regulatory authorisation.
The Group is involved in a number of disputes in respect of its
business. These should not have any significant negative impact on
the Group’s financial position. To the Group’s knowledge, there
were no exceptional events or litigation likely to have a significant
negative impact on the Group’s or its subsidiaries’ operations,
assets or results, other than those mentioned in the Highlights.

Country risk

The country risk is analysed from two perspectives. The first
relates to the distribution activities most of which take place in
safe regions such as Europe and the United States, as opposed to
regions that are the most exposed to economic, geopolitical and
monetary uncertainties like China, Latin America and the Middle
East, which represent less than 10% of the Group’s sales. Russia
and Ukraine, which are currently exposed to an increased
geopolitical risk, account for less than 1% of the Group’s sales.
SOMFY is closely monitoring the development of the conflict and
stopped exporting to Russia at the start of the war. Within this
uncertain environment, potential asset impairment of
approximately €3.4 million has been measured by SOMFY, for
which provision has been made at 31December 2022 (see
Highlights). The second perspective relates to the production and
procurement activities which are more exposed than the
distribution activities, since SOMFY has production sites in Tunisia

23

02 MANAGEMENT REPORT

and China, and a large proportion of its suppliers of components
have close connections with Asia, and more specifically China. In
relation to this second perspective, given the level of risk, business
continuity plans have been developed in order to reduce and
control this risk.

Non-financial risks

All the non-financial and financial risks related to climate change
are detailed on pages 40 to 42 as part of the non-financial
statement. Since 2021, particular attention has been given to
identifying the risks related to the Group’s CSR challenges, which
have been added to the Group’s catalogue of risks for each
process. These risks have been assessed in 2022.

Furthermore, the CSR risks detailed in the non-financial statement
do not stand out in themselves as major risks in the Risks factors
section, since the Group has decided to present its main risks on a
consolidated basis, as macro-risks, while the CSR challenges are
presented with a more granular level of detail.

INSURANCE AND RISK COVERAGE

As part of the risk management process, the Group has put in
place a policy based on prevention and the protection of sites and
people in order to limit the likelinood of occurrence of potential
accidents.

The Group covers the main risks with the following insurance

policies:

— “property damage”, covering buildings and their contents in all
locations (equipment, goods, IT equipment) as well as resulting
monetary and operational losses. The events insured are, as a
minimum, fire, explosions, lightning, smoke, emissions, steam,
impacts from airborne objects, vehicle collisions, electrical risks,
storms, hurricanes, cyclones, snow, hail, water damage, frost,
machine breakage, computer risks, malicious acts, acts of
vandalism, rioting, popular movements and IT equipment theft,
and natural disasters, except where local circumstances make
this impossible;

— “general civil liability relating to the monetary consequences of
an insured entity’s liability following physical injury, property
damage or moral prejudice caused to a third party during or in
relation to its operations”;

— “corporate officers’ civil liability”;

— “transported goods”.

In addition, Group credit insurance contracts, both in France and

internationally, mitigate the consequences of customer default.

Approximately 90% of sales are covered by such contracts.

NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT

(ARTICLE L. 225-102-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

The non-financial statement is presented in chapter 3 of this Annual report for ease of reading. It forms an integral part of the management

report.

INFORMATION ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
(ARTICLES L. 232-1 AND L. 233-26 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

In 2022, SOMFY carried out its Research and Development
activities generally in line with the established roadmap. Against a
backdrop of persisting pressures in the supply of components, the
Group also continued to invest to strengthen its R&D teams to
support the continued development of the range, and to tailor
existing products to ensure continuity of sales.

Following the integration of Teleco Automation, at the end of 2022
SOMFY had 18 R&D centres and 633 engineers (including 458 in
France).

The Group pursued its R&D globalisation strategy with the aim of
improving efficiency and speed of the development of new ranges.
In 2022, the Group filed 40 patent applications with the patent
office INPI (Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle) which had
published 40 of them in 2021. At the end of 2022, SOMFY had a
portfolio of 2,219 registered patents.

Thanks to the continuing roll-out of eco-design, 65.9% of Somfy
products sold worldwide in 2022 were Act For Green certified. Act
For Green certification is one of the levers of the Group’s
environmental programme aimed at reducing its carbon footprint.

In 2022, SOMFY was awarded the EcoVadis gold medal, with a
score of 67/100, and is now in the 4% of best performing
companies in its category according to EcoVadis ratings.

24 new products and services commercialised by the Group in 2022
Within an environment marked by the shortage in components
and the rising cost of energy and raw materials, SOMFY
strengthened its industrial resilience in 2022. At the end of the
financial year, almost 75% products in volume terms now benefit
from dual electronic design and, very often, from two independent
industrial flows. The Group also reworked the design of its
products to be able to significantly reduce shortages for its
customers should a further supply chain crisis — particularly
electronic — occur.

SOMFY ~ ANNUAL REPORT 2022

24

SOMFY also continued to develop and launch new products and

services, including:

— thermal comfort and energy efficiency solutions:
Solar protection (roller shutters, adjustable awnings, blinds)
makes a significant contribution to the energy performance and
thermal comfort of buildings. In summer, in particular, their
automation limits peaks in heat inside buildings during
heatwaves. To make these benefits as widely accessible as
possible, SOMFY is investing heavily in dedicated technical
solutions.
In September 2022, the Group launched the first pre-set
thermal comfort scenario in TaHoma, designed to be enhanced
over the coming months and years to continually increase its
performance and ease of use. This innovation also enables
SOMFY’s solutions to be successfully developed within the
framework of thermal regulations covering buildings in France
(RE2020);

— Standardisation of language for connected objects:
Committed to open protocols for the connected home, as a
sponsor SOMEFY is continuing to contribute to the planned new
protocol, Matter, which aims to standardise the language used
for connected objects, alongside Apple, Google, Amazon,
Schneider Electric and Signify (PhilipsHue). Around the world,
more than 280 companies have joined forces to help develop
this protocol which has become a new connectivity standard,
integrated natively into smartphones and virtual assistants,
providing increased compatibility between the various products
in the smart home.
In November 2022, at the global launch of Matter in
Amsterdam, SOMFY presented a prototype of a motor for an
interior blind and remote control which works with the new
Matter protocol, and which is natively compatible with Apple
and Google products in particular. By simplifying the
interoperability of consumer products, Matter will enable
manufacturers to focus on the inherent added value of their
products as part of a connected ecosystem. For SOMFY, this
means improved value propositions in terms of energy
efficiency, thermal comfort, visual comfort, security, and air and
ventilation quality.

TO EMPLOYEES AND/OR TO CERTAIN CORPORATE OFFICERS OF
THE COMPANY OR RELATED ENTITIES AND ECONOMIC INTEREST
GROUPS (SEVENTH EXTRAORDINARY RESOLUTION)

You are asked to grant the Board of Directors an authorisation for

thirty-eight months to allocate, in one or more occasions, in

accordance with Articles L.225-197-1 and L.225-197-2 of the

Commercial Code, existing ordinary shares of the company, for the

benefit of:

— employees of the company or companies or economic interest
groups directly or indirectly related to it within the meaning of
Article L. 225-197-2 of the Commercial Code;

— and/or corporate officers meeting the conditions set out by
Article L. 225-197-1 of the Commercial Code.

The total number of shares allocated free of charge under this
authorisation may not exceed 1.5% of the share capital of the
company on the date of this General Meeting, it being specified
that it may not exceed the maximum percentage of the share
capital provided for by regulations on the date on which the
allocation decision is made, and that this limit would count
towards the total number of shares that may confer the right to
share purchase options able to be granted by the Board of
Directors in respect of the authorisation granted by this General
Meeting in its eighth resolution and any other subsequent similar
authorisation granted by the General Meeting.
Where applicable, added to this limit would be the nominal
amount of the increase in share capital required to safeguard the
rights of the beneficiaries of free allocations of shares in the event
of transactions on the company’s share capital during the vesting
period.
The allocation of shares to beneficiaries would be definitive at the
end of a vesting period whose duration, which may not be less
than one year, will be set by the Board of Directors.
Beneficiaries should, where applicable, retain these shares for a
minimum period, set by the Board of Directors, at least equal to
that required to ensure that the cumulative duration of the
vesting, and where necessary the retention, periods may not be
less than two years.
As an exception, the final allocation would take place before the
end of the vesting period in the event of the beneficiary’s infirmity
corresponding to the second or third category referred to in
Article L. 341-4 of the Social Security Code.
As such, the Board of Directors would have all necessary powers to
set the conditions and, where required, the criteria for the
definitive allocation of the shares; to determine the identity of the
beneficiaries as well as the number of shares allocated to each of
them, where necessary, to acquire the shares required in
accordance with Article L. 225-208 of the Commercial Code and to
allot them to the allocation plan; to determine the impacts on the
rights of beneficiaries of transactions modifying the share capital
or likely to impact the value of the shares allocated and completed
during the vesting period and, as a result, to amend or adjust, if
necessary, the number of shares allocated to preserve the rights of
beneficiaries; to decide whether or not to set a retention
obligation at the end of the vesting period and, where necessary,
to determine its duration and take all appropriate measures to
ensure compliance with it by the beneficiaries; and generally, do
anything within the framework of current regulations that may be
required by the implementation of this authorisation.

29

This authorisation would, where applicable, cause any unused
portion of any prior authorisation to lapse.

AUTHORISATION TO BE GRANTED TO THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS TO ALLOCATE SHARE PURCHASE OPTIONS TO
EMPLOYEES (AND/OR TO CERTAIN CORPORATE OFFICERS)
(EIGHTH EXTRAORDINARY RESOLUTION)

We request that you authorise the Board of Directors, for a
duration of thirty-eight months, under the provisions of
Articles L. 225-177 to L. 225-185 of the Commercial Code, to grant,
on one of more occasions, options conferring entitlement to
purchase existing shares in the company, purchased under
conditions provided for by the law, for the benefit of employees or
certain employees, or certain categories of staff of SOMFY and,
where applicable, companies or economic interest groups
affiliated with it under the conditions of Article L. 225-180 of the
Commercial Code; and corporate officers who fulfil the conditions
set by Article L. 225-185 of the Commercial Code.

The total number of options that may be granted by the Board of
Directors under this authorisation may not entitle beneficiaries to
purchase more than 1.5% of the share capital outstanding on the
date of this Meeting, it being specified that this limit would count
towards the total number of shares that may be granted free of
charge by the Board of Directors under the authorisation granted
by this General Meeting in its seventh resolution and any other
similar subsequent authorisation granted by the General Meeting.
The nominal amount of the capital increase necessary to preserve
the rights of beneficiaries of options in the event of a share capital
transaction on the company’s share capital — in accordance with
the law and, where applicable, the contractual stipulations
providing for other terms and conditions related to their
protection — would be added to this amount where applicable.

The purchase price paid for the shares by the beneficiaries will be
set on the date on which the options are allocated by the Board of
Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-177
paragraph 4 of the Commercial Code and may not be below 80% of
the average purchase price of the shares held by the company
under Article L. 225-208 of the Commercial Code.

The term of the options set by the Board of Directors may not
exceed a period of six years from their date of allocation.

As such, the Board of Directors would have, within the limits set
out above, all necessary powers to set the other terms, conditions
and procedures for the allocation of options and their exercise,
and in particular to set the conditions under which the options will
be allocated and approve the list or categories of beneficiaries as
provided for above; set, where applicable, the conditions regarding
length of service and performance that these beneficiaries must
fulfil; decide on the conditions under which the price and number
of shares should be adjusted in particular in the scenarios referred
to in Articles R. 225-137 to R. 225-142 of the Commercial Code; set
the exercise period(s) for the options thus granted; provide for the
capacity to temporarily suspend the exercise of the options for a
maximum period of three months in the event of financial
transactions involving the exercise of rights attached to the shares.
This authorisation would, where applicable, cause any unused
portion of any prior authorisation to lapse.

02 MANAGEMENT REPORT

AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE 27 OF THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION TO CANCEL DOUBLE VOTING RIGHTS

(ninth extraordinary resolution)

We propose, subject to the condition precedent of the approval of the Special General Meeting of holders of shares with double voting
rights pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-99 of the Commercial Code, to cancel the double voting rights that are attached to SOMFY
shares in accordance with Article L. 225-123 of the Commercial Code and Article 27 of the Articles of Association and, consequently, each
share in the company will entitle its holder to one vote at the end of this General Meeting.

As a result, we propose, under the same condition precedent, to replace paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Article 27 of the Articles of

Association by the following paragraph, with the rest of the Article remaining unchanged:

Previous wording

New wording

The voting right attached to shares is proportional to the capital
that they represent. For the same par value, each capital or
dividend share gives entitlement to one vote.

A voting right that is double that conferred on other shares,
proportionate to the fraction of the capital they represent, is
allocated to all fully paid shares that have been duly registered for
at least four years in the name of the same shareholder, at the
end of the calendar year preceding that of each General Meeting.
In the case of a capital increase by the capitalisation of reserves,
profits or issue premiums, registered shares granted free of
charge to a shareholder in exchange for existing shares, which
already benefit from this right, will be entitled to the same double
voting right.

All shares whose ownership has been transferred shall lose their
entitlement to a double voting right, except in instances provided
for by law.

The merger of the company has no effect on the double voting
right which may be exercised within the absorbing company, if
provided for by said company’s Articles of Association.

The voting right attached to shares is proportional to the capital
that they represent. For the same par value, each capital or
dividend share gives entitlement to one vote.

AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE 11 OF THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION TO ADD AN APPROVAL CLAUSE

(tenth extraordinary resolution)

On the report of the Commissioner for Special Benefits appointed in accordance with the regulations, we propose the introduction of an
approval clause for Article 11 of the Articles of Association, to amend this Article to take into account the delisting of shares in the company
from the Euronext Paris market and as a result to amend Article 11 of the Articles of Association as follows:

Previous wording

New wording

ARTICLE 11

Sale and transfer of shares
Shares may be traded freely unless otherwise stipulated by legal
or regulatory provisions.
Ownership of shares results from their registration in an account
opened in the name of their holder and held, either by the issuing
company or a representative of their choice if the securities are
registered, or by an authorised financial intermediary if they are
bearer shares. Share transfers, whether they are registered or
bearer shares, may be carried out by account-to-account
transfers.
Shares that are required to be registered by virtue of a regulatory
or statutory provision must, in order to be traded on a regulated
market or on a multilateral trading facility, have been transferred
to an administration account with an authorised intermediary
beforehand.
Moreover, those not necessarily required to be in registered form
can only be traded on a regulated market or a multilateral trading
facility in the form of bearer shares.
Each account holder must open, security-by-security, a general
record of transactions in which all the entries concerning the
holder accounts registered with them are listed chronologically.
As regards more specifically the issuing company, all transactions
concerning movements in and out of registered securities
accounts and triggering a change in the ownership of these
securities are listed in chronological order in a numbered and
initialled general record of transactions referred to as “Register of
Transactions”.

SOMFY ~ ANNUAL REPORT 2022

ARTICLE 11

Sale and transfer of shares
11.1 Share transfers
Transfers of shares and marketable securities giving access to the
share capital may be carried out by account-to-account transfers.
Share transfers will only be made based on transfer instructions
signed by the holder or their authorised representative.
Shares that have not been paid up in full may not be transferred.

11.2 Unrestricted transfers

Transfers between shareholders and transfers in the event of
donation, inheritance, divorce settlement or disposal, either to a
spouse, or an ascendant or descendant, take place without
restriction.

11.3 Transfers subject to approval

All transfers of shares or marketable securities giving access to the
share capital and not covered in 11.2 above — that said transfers
take place either free of charge or in return for consideration, by
way of sale, donation, inheritance, contribution, merger,
distribution, transfer of all assets or through a public tendering
process and that they relate to full ownership or any other right,
notably relating to bare ownership or usufruct — must be agreed in
advance.

30

Previous wording

02 MANAGEMENT REPORT

New wording

Account entries must be made at the latest within the six days
following either the stock market trading by the financial
intermediary or the receipt of instructions from the holder by the
issuing company.

Shares that have not been paid up in full may not be transferred.

The shareholder originating the transfer, or their rights holders,
must inform the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the
Board of Directors of the planned transfer by registered letter,
either with acknowledgement of receipt or delivered in person, or
by extrajudicial deed, specifying the first and last name, address
and nationality (or identification) of the beneficiary/ies of the
transfer (and, where this is a legal entity, the individuals who
ultimately control it within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the
Commercial Code), the number and type of securities whose
transfer is planned, as well as the price offered or the estimated
value of the securities offered.

Authorisation is granted by the majority shareholder, the
company J.P.J.S., represented by its general managing partner, the
company FIDEP.

As an exception, approval of transfers of temporary usufruct
shares, to a not-for-profit French or foreign legal entity, and
covering the philanthropy, social, health, education, science and
cultural sectors (association, foundation, endowment fund, etc.) is
issued by the Chairman of the Management Committee of FIDEP
alone. Moreover, said individual retains the unilateral option of
requesting the opinion of the Management Committee of FIDEP in
this event.

The body issuing approval must give its opinion within a period of
two (2) months of receipt of the notice of the approval request.
The shareholder originating the transfer, or their rights holders,
must then be notified of the decision, by registered letter with
acknowledgement of receipt, or by extrajudicial deed within a
period of one (1) month effective from the decision by the body
issuing the approval.

Failure to respond within the three (3) months following the
request amounts to a notification of approval.

The decision does not need to be substantiated and, in the event
of refusal to grant approval, cannot be contested.

In the event of refusal to grant approval, the company shall,
within a period of three (3) months effective from notification of
refusal to grant approval, arrange for all the shares or marketable
securities giving access to the share capital covered by the
transaction to be acquired, either by one or more shareholders or
a third party, or, with the consent of the assignor, by the
company, for the purpose of reducing the share capital.

Where there is no agreement between the parties, the price of
the shares or marketable securities giving access to the share
capital is determined under the conditions set out in
Article 1843-4 of the Civil Code. The assignor can withdraw from
the planned transfer at any time.

The expert will be appointed by mutual agreement between the
parties or, in the absence thereof, by order of the presiding judge
of the Paris Commercial Court, ruling in accordance with the
expedited substantive proceedings with no option to appeal.

All expert fees shall be shared equally between all the parties
concerned.

If, upon the expiry of the period of three (3) months set out
above, the purchase has not been completed, approval is deemed
to have been given. However, this deadline can be extended by
court ruling at the request of the company.

appointed by it if the securities are requested in registered form.
It is held by an authorised financial intermediary if the securities

future voting rights in its Meetings, and of the number of
securities held by each of them.

Deliberations of the Board of Directors are recorded by minutes
prepared in a special register in accordance with applicable legal
and regulatory provisions.
