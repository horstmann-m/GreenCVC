Our Patient Value Strategy > We build on a strong heritage

In 2015, UCB has embarked on a very important change journey guided by our Patient
Value Strategy.

This evolution from the traditional pharma model was
critical for us to remain competitive and sustainable for
the long-term in an increasingly complex and value-
focused healthcare environment. Our operating model

From Science to Solution
We aim to translate scientific hypotheses into
innovative solutions and engage patients in the

journey.

Inspired by patients ...

We start research from the patients’ perspective rather than
commencing from a pure scientific point of view. We listen
to patients to encompass the full impact of the disease: the
unpredictability, the physical effects and the heavy social
stigma... They affect every part of a patient's life, including
their education, employment and independence. It also
has a major impact on their family.

15

Understanding the patient's journey: from the first
symptoms to the correct diagnosis can take years and
patients go through a lot of emotions — both positive and
negative. By understanding the impact of their condition
on their daily lives, we can all make a positive change in
the lives of those who face similar challenges.

66 No matter how hopeless this battle might appear at
| first, it is possible to fight back and manage it.

Rebecca, living with rheumatoid arthritis

Even though there are similarities, a disease can
manifest itself in different ways for different patients.
Think about epilepsy: to date, more than 30 different
types of seizures have been identified. One thing
patients living with epilepsy have in common: they all
want to get seizures under control — a primary goal
leading to a higher quality of life. We cannot go fora
“one fits all” approach anymore.

.. Driven by sciences

Innovation is a key component of our strategy,
generating insights that can be translated into clinical
differentiation in the next step.

The discovery and development of new drugs is a lengthy
and complicated process. Yet it is an essential part of what
we do: our science has already delivered solutions for
people with severe chronic diseases in the fields of
immunology and neurology — but we know there is still a
need for new treatments and cures. To fuel innovation, UCB
continues to invest more than 20% of its revenue in "R&D".

However, UCB is also pragmatic and humble enough to
recognize that one company, even one as dynamic as

16

UCB, cannot conquer severe diseases on its own. We
focus our resource where we can make a real difference
and out-license pipeline assets in areas where UCB
cannot lead. We collaborate in several hundred
alliances, ranging from partnerships with European and
U.S. academic groups to multiple industrial agreements,
as well as memberships in major government-led
consortia. Thanks to this network, UCB teams can share
and gain knowledge - sometimes leading to
acquisitions, such as Beryllium or Element Genomics, or
spin-offs like Syndesi Therapeutics.

Our business model starts and ends with
the patient.

We combine patient insights with science, translating
them into solutions. However, to create value for
patients we must also ensure they have access to UCB
solutions! UCB's patient value strategy takes root in our
ambition to improve patients’ lives through dedicated
treatments, medications — and services while adapting
to specific dynamics and stakeholder influences in local
patient environments. On our website, we provide
information on our sponsored clinical studies giving
patients the opportunity to make informed decisions
about participating in UCB’s clinical studies. We created
UCBCares®, a dedicated service to support patients
through their treatment journey beyond medical
information.

With the Patient Value Strategy, UCB aims to deliver
unique outcomes and the best patient experience to as
many lives as possible within specific populations. UCB
will only commercialize assets where we can have the
biggest impact. If we are not in that position of strength,
we will partner to unleash that value.

1. Patient Insights to Patient Outcomes
At UCB, everything starts and ends with the patient.
This systematic approach helps ensure that patients’
experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities are
incorporated and meaningfully captured into the
development and assessment of our solutions. We
engage patients and patient advocates before, during
and after the development continuum to gain
insights into patient unmet needs and preference
that is translated into UCB development strategy that
delivers real value

Data and its Utility

We deep dive in clinical trial databases and real world
evidence to better understand patient outcomes,
populations, segmentation and complex
heterogeneity of each patient's journey, to answer a
specific question or enhance clinical design. We also
assess the direct/indirect impact of a therapeutic
intervention on healthcare outcomes and cost,
which can be used to show additional value of
medicines to healthcare systems.

Innovative Approaches

We look at biomarkers that can be used to assess
target engagement, proof of concept, prognostic
and predictive outcomes, surrogate endpoints, and
safety. We apply innovative studies that include
alternative and flexible study designs and use data to
decide on how to modify aspects of the study
without undermining the productivity of R6D. We
also incorporate digital technology to support drug
development.

Global Populations

We intend to focus on sub-group patient
populations such as pediatrics, geriatrics, women of
childbearing age, etc.. They are normally not
considered in core development programs due to
high-risk medical considerations. At the same time,
we want to include less-defined markets (e.g. Japan,
China, Brazil, and Russia) earlier in the development
process, in order to expedite patient access to
therapeutics in these regions.

20

Our R&D focus is very clear: to get the
right molecule to the right patient for the
right indication.

Our pipeline builds the basis of UCB’s future hence we
invested 25% of revenue into R&D in 2018. We focus on
breakthrough innovative approaches with the goal of
developing new highly differentiated solutions that

will significantly impact the lives of patients. We have
developed a unique partnership with patients at every
step of the clinical development process to identify
needs and inform study design and operations.

We connect with them to get their insights and
experiences which lead us to a deeper understanding of
their needs. Moreover, building on recent advances in
human biology, genetics and biomarkers and big data,
we are working on new ways to scientifically identify
sub-group patient populations so that we can better
predict which patients will respond to our medicines.

We then leverage our internal scientific expertise, our
proprietary technology platforms and external network
of internationally renowned scientists and academics to
identify the next generation of breakthrough candidates.
We set up clear milestones that enable us to make
robust data-driven decisions. We aim for a strong signal
- positive or negative - so we can rapidly advance
promising molecules into innovative therapies or stop
unviable options and reallocate resources within our
pipeline.

We will only progress molecules in-house if we can
have the biggest impact in our core therapeutic areas:
immunology and neurology. We might not bring all
projects to the market and may decide at some point to
partner with external parties/organizations to maximize
project potential and reach as many patients as possible.
For a company of our size, it is vital to remain focused.

Ageing populations, the increased prevalence of severe
chronic diseases and health funding constraints have
caused healthcare system stakeholders to increasingly
scrutinize the value of medicines and outcomes they
deliver. UCB believes that value begins with what
matters most to patients but also must reflect the needs

From Patient Value Strategy to patient access

of a given healthcare system in which patients receive
care. We consider fulfilment of these criteria vital to
ensuring sustainable access to our solutions.

Our approach is guided accordingly by 3 foundational
principles:

Increase Health & Value
Encourage the development and adaption of

medicines that create patient value

Sustain innovation
Promote and reward innovation in a way
that is sustainable both for UCB and the
healthcare ecosystem

In our quest to ensure access to our healthcare
solutions, we actively pursue value-based agreements of
various types, including those driven directly by patient
outcomes, those that share risk with payers and those
that focus on patient populations that benefit the most
from treatment. They should result in creating faster
access for patients, delivering higher value to payers
while supporting the discovery, development and
commercialization of differentiated, high-value
medicines. We consider value-based agreements vital
tools for sustainable biopharmaceutical innovation,
healthcare financing and patient access to care — and
the resulting public health and societal gains. As a
consequence, UCB has numerous value-based
agreements in place in Europe and the U.S., either at the
national level or with regional payers and local hospitals.

Do the right thing for the right patient
Guide us to act fairly so that patients who

these medicines

UCB is also committed to support patients through their
treatment journey to foster the best possible experience
with UCB healthcare solutions. In 2014, UCB launched
UCBCares®, a dedicated service to support patients
beyond medical information. UCBCares® aims to
provide more than answering questions and addressing
concerns that patients might have. We are thus gradually
enhancing our services, advancing from a transactional
approach to more holistic and personalized solutions.
Where applicable, this includes sharing guidance which
can help patients to better understand and manage their
treatments. UCBCares® extends to key stakeholders like
caregivers and healthcare professionals as well. No
matter who is getting in touch with us — the ultimate
goal is to offer the best possible support to improve the
lives of patients. First launched in the U.S., UCBCares® is
now present in 19 European countries. On average, UCB
receives 65 000 inquiries a year.

Today, nearly 60% of patients newly diagnosed with
epilepsy become seizure free with their first anti-
epileptic drug. But for 30-40% of patients, seizures

24

remain uncontrolled. These are the great challenges we
continue to tackle.

To date, more than 30 different types of seizures have
been identified. From one patient to another, seizure
types and frequency vary greatly. Some are short, like
muscle jerks, while others are prolonged convulsions.
Some patients may experience them rarely, while others
battle seizures multiple times per day. Focal seizures
start in just one part of the brain, while generalized
seizures are the result of simultaneous abnormal activity
of the whole brain. Epilepsy can be triggered by head
injuries, strokes, brain damage at birth and brain tumors;
but a vast majority of cases seem to have no apparent
cause®. One thing patients battling epilepsy all have in
common: they all want to regain control — a primary
goal leading to a higher quality of life. We cannot go
for a “one fits all” approach anymore.


--- Page 11 ---

Our Patient Value Strategy > 3 From Patient Value Strategy to action in epilepsy

UCB's expertise in the field of epilepsy is widely
recognized in the scientific and medical communities.
Our story began several decades ago when a group of
UCB scientists in Braine-l'Alleud (Belgium) discovered
one molecule with a unique profile in epilepsy models.
Showing their confidence, they challenged the
conventional scientific approach to test new epilepsy
treatments and continued their research which
identified a truly novel mechanism for levetiracetam that
eventually became the first blockbuster drug in epilepsy
under the brand name Keppra®.

Keppra® opened the door to a whole new approach to
treat epilepsy with a radically new mechanism of action,
correlating novel activity profiles of molecules in
innovative preclinical models. This approach generated
projects such as Briviact®, padsevonil and also led to the
identification of novel compounds for treatment of
cognitive disorders. The latter triggered the creation of a
spin-off company, Syndesi Therapeutics.

UCB continues exploring how new technologies and big
data may improve diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy

EEG: Electroencephalography

25

such as eliprio™, a program that harnesses predictive
analytics and machine learning to personalize epilepsy
treatment. Another example is our investment in
Ceribell, an exciting Silicon Valley based healthcare
startup developing a novel, innovative and disruptive
clinical quality portable EEG system which allows for
instant epilepsy diagnosis.

UCB has made a major contribution for improving
epilepsy care by bringing different treatment options to
patients and healthcare professionals: Keppra®,
Vimpat® and Briviact®. In 2018 UCB also acquired the
rights for nasal administration of midazolam, a treatment
for acute repetitive seizures currently under review by
the FDA.

However, therapies of epilepsy only target the
symptoms of the disease and leave 30% of all patients
with uncontrolled seizures. This emphasizes a need for
identifying new treatments that can prevent or cure
epilepsy — a journey UCB has already embarked on and
is looking to pioneer!

There are many patients suffering from chronic

27

For women with chronic inflammatory disease, the
prospect of having children brings many questions
about health and medicines.

Women frequently discontinue their treatment before
and throughout pregnancy, a time when disease control
is essential to ensure optimal infant and maternal health,
or reluctantly postpone conception. The consequences
of active disease in pregnancy can have serious
implications for both mother and infant, including an
increased risk of miscarriage, an increased risk of
preterm delivery, the need for a caesarean, and the
infant being small for gestational age. These women are
faced with difficult questions regarding the impact of
active disease flares on themselves and their babies and
need more information on therapeutic intervention

UCB - INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018

UCB has been leading the way in studying how biologic
drugs impact women of childbearing age, conducting
two first-of-their-kind studies, CRIB (to evaluate the
placental transfer mother-foetus) and CRADLE (to
evaluate the transfer to breast milk). Results
demonstrated minimal transfer of Cimzia® through
placenta or through the breast milk. CRIB and
CRADLE data led to a label update in 2018, helping
women and their treating physicians to make informed
decisions to manage their condition along their
pregnancy journey.

Because of its visible and physically debilitating aspects,
psoriasis often takes an emotional toll on patients,
causing increased self-consciousness, frustration,
fatigue, depression, and even suicidal ideation. Thanks
to innovation, new treatment options have been
developed and are available to patients. This broader

choice of therapeutics also led to higher expectations
among patients. Less plaque is not enough anymore,
they want a clear skin, they want all physical, emotional
and social signs of the disease to disappear!

UCB is developing bimekizumab. Our scientific
hypothesis: by targeting inflammation associated with
psoriasis on two fronts, neutralizing IL-17A and IL-17F
cytokines, bimekizumab has the potential to raise the
bar for achieving and maintaining skin clearance rates.
Phase 2b results showed that up to 60% treated with
bimekizumab rapidly achieved completely clear skin.
Based on the fast and significant results, UCB rapidly
advanced to Phase 3 clinical development program,
with results expected in Q4 2019.

innovative antibody

molecular analysis, establishing that the condition of
sclerosteosis development is due to the absence of
sclerostin, a naturally occurring protein that regulates
the rate of bone formation. This provided the stimulus
for our research in this area.

a v In 2004, we partnered this project with Amgen, a
L | E company with an existing expertise in the area of
osteoporosis. Since then, we have conducted further

Evenity™ (romosozumab). Evenity™ binds and inhibits
the protein sclerostin, resulting in a dual effect on bone:

increasing bone formation and decreasing bone

near future. Early 2019, we achieved a first milestone
with the approval for Evenity™ in Japan.

Today, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over 50 are at risk
of an osteoporotic fracture. Every 3 seconds someone
breaks a bone due to osteoporosis, this adds up to
almost 9 million fractures happening every year. A
fragility fracture is commonly the first sign of

osteoporosis. Thus, the first fracture should be taken as
an important warning sign. It should lead patients to talk
with their doctor to inquire about osteoporosis and
determine whether they require therapy. This is an
important step as 80% of those who experienced a
fracture are not identified, nor treated for osteoporosis.

¢ 2018 revenue increased by 2%, +5% at constant
exchange rates (CER) to € 4 632 million. Net sales
went up to € 4 412 million (+5%, +8% CER). This
growth was driven by the continued performance of
the core products in immunology, Cimzia®, the
epilepsy franchise: Vimpat®, Keppra® and Briviact®, as
well as the Parkinson drug Neupro®. Royalty income
and fees reached € 92 million. Other revenue

decreased to € 128 million.

Recurring EBITDA grew to € 1 398 million by 2% (+5%
CER), thanks to core product growth and despite
higher R&D expense

Profit reached € 823 million from € 771 million, of

which € 800 million is attributable to UCB

shareholders after € 753 million in 2017.

UCB - INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018

This Business Performance Review is based on the
consolidated financial statements for the UCB Group of
companies prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
separate statutory financial statements of UCB SA
prepared in accordance with Belgian Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles, together with the
report of the Board of Directors to the General Assembly
of Shareholders, as well as the auditors’ report, will be
filed at the National Bank of Belgium within the statutory
periods, and be available on request or on our website.

Scope change: As a result of the divestment of the
activities Films (September 2004), Surface Specialties
(February 2005), and the divestiture of Kremers Urban
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (November 2015), UCB reports the
results from those activities as a part of profit from
discontinued operations.

12 Key events*

There have been a number of key events that have
affected or will affect UCB financially:

1.2.1. Important agreements/initiatives

« February 2018 - UCB and an investor syndicate led by
Novo Seeds launched Syndesi Therapeutics to
develop novel therapeutics for cognitive disorders.
Syndesi Therapeutics has exclusively licensed a first-
in-class small molecule program from UCB. A series A
investment totaling € 17 million will fund the clinical
development of the lead compound up to early
proof-of-concept in humans.

« Early 2018, UCB and partner Vectura decided to
license out UCB4144/VR942, a dry powder inhaled
biologic which successfully completed Phase 1 in
2017.

« March 2018 —- UCB acquired Element Genomics in
the U.S. to strengthen UCB’s genomics and
epigenomics research platform to identify novel drug
targets.

e April 2018 —- UCB agreed to acquire midazolam nasal
spray (USL261) from Proximagen. USL261 is a nasally
administered investigational midazolam formulation
intended as a rescue treatment of acute repetitive
seizures in patients with epilepsy. Closing occurred in

Recurring and non-recurring: Transactions and
decisions of a one-time nature that affect UCB's results
are shown separately ("“non-recurring’” items). Besides
EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes or operating
profit), a line for “recurring EBIT” (REBIT or recurring
operating profit), reflecting the on-going profitability of
the company’s biopharmaceutical activities, is included.
The recurring EBIT is equal to the line “operating profit
before impairment, restructuring and other income and
expenses" reported in the consolidated financial
statements.

Core EPS is the profit attributable to the UCB
shareholders, adjusted for the after-tax impact of non-
recurring items, the financial one-offs, the after-tax
contribution from discontinued operations and the
after-tax amortization of intangibles linked to sales, per
non-dilutive weighted average number of shares.

June 2018. The new drug application was accepted
for filing by the FDA in August, following previous
orphan drug status and fast-track designation.

« May 2018 — UCB has entered into an agreement with
Science 37, Los Angeles, CA (U.S.), a trailblazing
company focused on “site-less" clinical trials. Science
37's decentralized clinical trial approach combines
technologies that can fundamentally change the way
clinical trials are run. With this collaboration, UCB
aims to provide a better patient experience, to
innovate and accelerate clinical studies in a patient-
focused way and to bring new solutions to patients
faster.

e May 2018 — The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (CAFC) has affirmed the Delaware District
Court and confirmed the validity of U.S. patent
RE38,551 related to Vimpat® (lacosamide), UCB's
anti-epileptic drug.

¢ In September, in line with its strategic focus, UCB sold
its subsidiary “Innere Medizin”. “Innere Medizin” has
been successfully promoting pharmaceutical products
in Germany for many years, mainly in the internal
medicine area for cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases

1.2.2 Regulatory update and pipeline progress

Neurology

e In January 2018, UCB filed Vimpat® (lacosamide) for
pediatric patients living with partial-onset epilepsy at
four years and older in Japan.

¢ In February, the Phase 2b study with padsevonil
started for drug resistant epilepsy patients. First results
are expected in H1 2020.

e In March, UCB0107, a humanized, immunoglobulin
monoclonal antibody with a specificity for human tau,
entered the clinical phase 1 program.

¢ In May, Briviact® (brivaracetam) oral formulations
were approved in the U.S. indicated as monotherapy
and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial
onset (focal) epileptic seizures in patients age four
years and older.

* In June, the Committee for Medicinal Products for
Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines
Agency has adopted a positive opinion for Briviact® to
extend the therapeutic indication to include
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset
seizures with or without secondary generalization in
patients with epilepsy from 4 years of age. The
European Commission approved this in July.

In August, the new drug application for midazolam
nasal spray was accepted for filing by the FDA,
following previous orphan drug status and fast-track
designation.

Positive phase 2 results for Briviact® (brivaracetam) in
acute repetitive seizures were achieved in July.

e UCB pioneered with the extrapolation concept in
China: in March 2018 UCB filed Keppra®
(levetiracetam) for monotherapy of partial onset
epilepsy seizures based on extrapolation from
adjunctive therapy with sound scientific rationale and
was approved in August. In September, UCB
submitted Vimpat® (lacosamide) \V (intravenous) and
oral formulation for the adjunctive therapy of partial
onset epilepsy seizures in children above 4 years and
for adults, based on extrapolation.

« In October, UCB announced positive results from a
phase 2 study with a novel, subcutaneous FcRn
(neonatal Fc receptor) monoclonal antibody,
rozanolixizumab, in patients with myasthenia gravis
(MG), achieving proof-of-concept. These results
support the acceleration of rozanolixizumab

development with a confirmatory study in MG starting
in Q2 2019.

In December, Vimpat® (lacosamide) was approved in
China as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of
partial-onset seizures with or without secondary
generalization in adult and adolescent patients 16
years of age and older with epilepsy. In January 2019,
Vimpat® was approved in Japan for the treatment of
partial onset seizures in children 4 years of age and
older. In addition, two new formulations have been
approved, IV (intravenous) and dry syrup.

.

In December, Keppra® (levetiracetam) for
monotherapy of epilepsy as well as an updated
pregnancy language was submitted to the U.S.
authorities. The application was accepted for filing by
the FDA in January 2019. The Keppra® pregnancy
label has been approved in the EU in April 2018.

.

At the end of 2018, one phase 1 project in neurology,
UCB3491, was terminated due to lack of patients for
recruitment — driven by sufficient standard of care.

Immunology

« A label update for Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) in
pregnancy and breastfeeding was approved in Europe
(January 2018) and in the U.S. (March 2018), making it
the first anti- TNF treatment option that could be
considered for women with chronic inflammatory
disease throughout the pregnancy journey.
In March 2018, the Cimzia® pre-filed syringe received
approval in the U.S. for the option to store it at room
temperature for a single period of up to 7 days, within
the approved shelf-life, thus helping better address
patient needs.
Also in March, UCB announced the filing of Cimzia
with the State Drug Administration (SDA, former
CFDA) in China for the treatment of moderate-to-
severe rheumatoid arthritis. In June, the SDA has

®

granted priority review.

In April, the European Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended
approval of a label extension for Cimzia®, to include a
new indication in adult patients with moderate-to-
severe plaque psoriasis. The European Commission
endorsed this in June.

In May, Cimzia® was approved for adults with
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the U.S.

Also in May, UCB announced positive topline results
from C-AXSPAND, a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study

149

UCB - INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018

to investigate the efficacy of Cimzia® on the signs and
symptoms of active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in
patients without x-ray evidence of ankylosing
spondylitis (AS). In September, these data were
submitted to the U.S. regulatory authorities for non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and
were accepted for filing in October. In August, the
Japanese authorities approved the Cimzia®
AutoClick® device. In September, the label update for
Cimzia® in pregnancy and breastfeeding was
approved in Japan. Also in September and in Japan,
positive phase 3 results were achieved for Cimzia® in
patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
Submission to the Japanese agency took place in
January 2019.

« During the course of the first half of 2018, further
studies with bimekizumab in moderate to severe
psoriasis were initiated. Out of the ongoing three
Phase 3 studies, two include an active comparator,
namely ustekinumab, and adalimumab. Results are
expected by the end of 2019. An additional Phase 3b
study to compare bimekizumab directly with
secukinumab was initiated in June. The comparative
studies have been designed to demonstrate
superiority over active comparators on robust
endpoints.

« In July, a full evaluation of early-stage clinical studies
of seletalisib in Sjogren's syndrome and activated
P13K Delta Syndrome (APDS) showed positive results
and no new safety signal was observed. However, in
light of its other upcoming R&D investments and as
part of its regular portfolio prioritization, UCB has

1 From 1 January 2018 up to the publication of date of this report

decided to deprioritize further internal development
of seletalisib.

e |In October, UCB and its partner Biogen announced
top-line results from a Phase 2b study with
dapirolizumab pegol (DZP) in moderately-to-severely
active systemic lupus erythematosus. UCB and Biogen
continue to further evaluate these data while
assessing potential next steps.

* At the end of 2018, one phase 1 project, UCB6673,
was returned to the partner — due to prioritization
within the UCB pipeline.

Bone

e Early January 2019, UCB and Amgen announced the
approval of Evenity™ (romosozumab) in Japan.
Evenity™ is approved in Japan to reduce the risk of
fractures and increase bone mineral density in men
and post-menopausal women with osteoporosis at
high risk of fracture. One week later, the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Bone, Reproductive
and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (BRUDAC)
voted positively for the approval of romosozumab.
While the FDA is not bound by the Advisory
Committee's recommendations, it takes the advice
into consideration when making its decision. The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently
reviewing a marketing application for romosozumab
and interactions with the agency are ongoing

All other clinical development programs are continuing
as planned.
