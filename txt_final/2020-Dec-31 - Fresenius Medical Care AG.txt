GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

The following discussion and analysis of the group manage-
ment report of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA and its
subsidiaries (together referred to as “we”, “our”, “FMC AG &
Co. KGaA", "Fresenius Medical Care”, “the Group” or “the Com-
pany”) was prepared in accordance with sections 315 of the
German Commercial Code and German Accounting Standards
No. 17 and 20, and should be read in conjunction with our con-
solidated financial statements and related notes contained
elsewhere in this report. Some of the statements, including
those concerning future revenue, costs and capital expendi-
tures, possible changes in our industry as well as the competi-
tive and financial conditions include forward-looking state-
ments. We made these forward-looking statements based on
the expectations and beliefs of the Management Board of the
Company's General Partner (Management Board) pertaining to
future events that may affect us, but which we cannot assure
that such events will occur or that the results will be as antici-
pated. Because these statements involve opportunities, risks
and uncertainties, the actual results may differ materially (pos-
itive as well as negative) from the results which the for-
ward-looking statements express or imply. The statements
cover the content of and are subject to the uncertainties
described in the discussions in this report in chapters “Out-
look" starting on PAGE 59 and “Risks and opportunities report”
starting on PAGE 62 as well as in NOTE 2 AND 22 of the notes to
the consolidated financial statements.

The non-financial group declaration is not part of the Group
Management Report. It is part of a separate chapter of the
Annual Report and will be disclosed as separate Non-Financial
Group Report together with the Group Management Report.
The Non-Financial Group Report can be found starting on
PAGE 80.

Due to rounding, individual numbers and percentages presented
in this report may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.

Our business is also subject to other opportunities, risks and
uncertainties that we describe in our public filings. Develop-
ments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ
materially to those that we or others have projected or may
project.

OVERVIEW
OF THE GROUP

We provide high-quality health care solutions
for patients with renal diseases. Our innovative
products and therapies set high standards in
dialysis treatment.

BUSINESS MODEL
Operations and company structure

Fresenius Medical Care is the world’s leading provider of prod-
ucts and services for individuals with renal diseases based on
publicly reported revenue and the number of patients treated.
We provide dialysis care and related services to people with
renal diseases, as well as other health care services. The health
care services that we offer in addition to dialysis are described
by the term “Care Coordination”. Together with dialysis ser-
vices, these constitute our health care services. We also
develop and manufacture a full range of dialysis machines,
systems and disposable products, which we sell to customers
in around 150 countries as well as using them in our own
health care service operations. Our dialysis business is there-
fore vertically integrated.

We continue to generate most of our revenue with dialysis
products and dialysis care services. In our 4,092 proprietary
dialysis clinics in around 50 countries worldwide, we provide
care for over 346,000 dialysis patients. We are continuously
expanding this network of clinics, which is the largest in the
world based on the number of patients treated, to accommo-
date the ever-rising number of dialysis patients. At the same
time, we operate 44 production sites in more than 20 coun-
tries. The most important plants for dialyzer production are in

19

St. Wendel (Germany), Ogden, Utah (U.S.), Changshu (China),
LArbresle (France), and Buzen (Japan). Dialysis machines are
manufactured in Schweinfurt (Germany) and in Concord, Cali-
fornia (U.S.).

Fresenius Medical Care has a decentralized structure and is
divided into the regions North America, Europe, Middle East
and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Our operat-
ing segments correspond to this regional breakdown (the
term “North America Segment” refers to our North America
operating segment, the term "EMEA Segment” refers to the
Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment, the term
“Asia-Pacific Segment” refers to our Asia-Pacific operating
segment, and the term “Latin America Segment" refers to our
Latin America operating segment).

Fresenius Medical Care's company headquarters is in Bad Hom-
burg v. d. Héhe, Germany. The headquarters in North America,
our most important region in terms of revenue, is in Waltham,
Massachusetts (U.S.).

CHART 2.2 ON PAGE 20 provides an overview of our most import-
ant production sites and headquarters.

Our products and services

Fresenius Medical Care provides mainly dialysis products and
services. We also offer non-dialysis services as part of Care
Coordination as well as non-dialysis products. Our products
and services for the fiscal year 2020 are shown in CHART 2.1.

Approximately 3.7 M patients worldwide regularly under-
went dialysis treatment at the end of 2020. Dialysis is a
life-saving blood cleansing procedure that substitutes the
function of the kidney in case of kidney failure. Healthy kid-
neys clean the blood of waste products, regulate water lev-
els, and produce important hormones. If the kidneys are

irreparably damaged and are therefore no longer able to
function adequately over a longer period of time, this is
known as chronic kidney failure or end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). Many diseases can lead to chronic kidney failure,
particularly diabetes, chronic nephritis or high blood pres-
sure. There are currently two treatment options for ESRD:
a kidney transplant and dialysis.

Our health care products

We develop, manufacture and distribute a wide variety of
health care products, including both dialysis and non-dialysis
products.

The dialysis products we offer in around 150 countries around
the world focus on the following therapies:

> Hemodialysis (HD) - HD is by far the most common type of
therapy for chronic kidney failure. Fresenius Medical Care pro-
vides a wide range of HD products in dialysis centers as well
as for use at home. They include machines, dialyzers, blood-
line systems, HD solutions and concentrates, water treatment
systems, as well as data processing and analysis systems.

> Peritoneal dialysis (PD) - In PD the peritoneum is used as a
natural filter. We offer systems and solutions for continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated
peritoneal dialysis (APD) in dialysis centers as well as for use
at home.

> Acute dialysis - In case of a sudden loss of renal function, con-
tinuous renal replacement therapy is used in intensive care
units. Fresenius Medical Care also provides products for this.

We also offer non-dialysis products including acute cardio-
pulmonary products and products for apheresis therapy, which
involves the removal of excess blood fats or pathogenic anti-
bodies.

21

Our health care services
Dialysis services

Dialysis patients receive life-saving dialysis treatment and
other associated services such as laboratory tests in our 4,092
(2019: 3,994) dialysis clinics worldwide. Dialysis treatment at
our clinics is usually performed three times a week over a
period of several hours by trained medical staff. We also pro-
vide advice on medical support and training for home dialysis
patients in our dialysis centers.

In 2020, we treated most of our patients (61%) in the North
America Segment, followed by 19 % in the EMEA Segment,
11 % in the Latin America Segment and 9 % in the Asia-Pacific
Segment.

Fresenius Medical Care is able to operate its own dialysis clinics
in countries where the health care system allows private-sector
companies to provide medical services and an appropriate
reimbursement system is in place.

Care Coordination

Care Coordination allows us to further enhance our business
beyond dialysis, for example in markets where the privatized
dialysis market is relatively well developed and we already have
a high market share. Although our Care Coordination business
is geared to different geographical markets, we currently pro-
vide non-dialysis services mainly in North America and Asia-
Pacific. In recent years, the health care system in the U.S. has
started to move away from reimbursement of individual ser-
vices toward holistic and coordinated care. Our Care Coordina-
tion activities and our experience in dialysis mean that we can
participate in the development of the U.S. health care system.
At the same time, patients can benefit from coordinated care,
and health care systems from lower costs.

Major markets and competitive position

According to our estimates, the number of dialysis patients
worldwide reached around 3.7 M in 2020 (2019: 3.6 M) -a 3%
growth rate. In the same period, 346,553 patients were treated
in Fresenius Medical Care's network of dialysis centers (2019:
345,096). This means that Fresenius Medical Care holds the
leading position worldwide in dialysis care. More information
on the number of patients can be found in CHART 2.3 ON
PAGE 22.

Fresenius Medical Care is also the global market leader for dial-
ysis products. Products made by Fresenius Medical Care for use
in our own dialysis centers or for sale to third-party customers
accounted for a market share of 35 % in 2020 (2019: 36 %). In
the case of hemodialysis products, we had a 40 % share of the
global market (2019: 41%), making us the world leader in this
field as well.

Dialyzers for hemodialysis are the largest product group in
the dialysis market with a worldwide sales volume of around
370 M units in 2020. Approximately 158 M (around 43 %) of
these were made by Fresenius Medical Care, giving us by far
the biggest market share. Hemodialysis machines constitute
another key component of our product business. Here, too, we
are the clear market leader. Of the estimated around 90,000
machines installed in 2020, approximately 42,000, or around
48 % (2019: more than 50 %), were produced by Fresenius
Medical Care.

Furthermore, we hold a strong position in the market for peri-
toneal dialysis products: Around 16 % (2019: around 16 %) of all
peritoneal dialysis patients use products made by Fresenius
Medical Care.

Fresenius Medical Care is also the global leader in dialysis care,
providing treatment to about 9 % of all dialysis patients. The

overall market for dialysis care services in the U.S. is consoli-
dated. Across all market segments, we treat around 38 % of all
dialysis patients here.

Outside the U.S., the dialysis services business is much more
fragmented. With over 1,460 dialysis centers and approxi-
mately 140,000 patients in around 50 countries, Fresenius
Medical Care operates by far the largest network of clinics.

Global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply

Global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply (GMQS) is the opera-
tions division within Fresenius Medical Care that manages the
procurement, production, distribution and supply of renal and
multi-organ therapy products. GMQS strives to ensure reliable
product quality and effective product supply at optimized total
cost with efficient utilization of capital.

The objective of our production strategy is to manufacture
high-quality products in the right place at the right time on the
best possible terms. We are able to implement this strategy
thanks to a network of large production sites, where we make
products for sale worldwide, as well as smaller production sites
that primarily supply products regionally.

Strategic purchasing at Fresenius Medical Care is geared
toward ensuring the availability, safety and quality of the mate-
rials used in production with the aim of further expanding our
competitive and internationally balanced supplier network.

At the end of 2020, GMQS had 16,307 employees (full-time
equivalents) (2019: 16,418).

CORPORATE STRATEGY
AND OBJECTIVES

“Creating a future worth living. For patients. Worldwide. Every
day.” This vision guides us in our efforts to give our patients
around the world a better life by offering them high-quality
products and outstanding health care.

At the same time, we expect to face a multitude of challenges
in the coming years: an aging population, a rise in chronic dis-
eases, fragmented care, staff shortages, cost pressure, digitali-
zation, and the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which require new
approaches and solutions in health care.

Renal care continuum

To meet the challenges of the future, we are leveraging our
core strategic competencies: innovating products, operating
outpatient facilities, standardizing medical procedures and
coordinating patients effectively.

Between now and 2025, we intend to go a step further and
take our strategy (SEE CHART 2.4 ON PAGE 23) to the next level
to bring us closer to our goal of providing health care for
chronically and critically ill patients across the renal care con-
tinuum. We aim to use our innovative, high-quality products
and services to offer sustainable solutions at a reliable cost.

The renal care continuum encompasses the following aspects:

> New renal care models:
We intend to use digital technologies such as artificial intelli-
gence and big data analytics to develop new care models for
patients with kidney failure, including personalized dialysis
and holistic home treatment.

c2.4 OUR WAY FORWARD - STRATEGY 2025

> Value-based care models:
Value-based care models allow us to offer care that is not only
better, but also affordable in the long term. Our aim is to
establish sustainable partnerships with payors around the
world to drive forward the transition from fee-for-service pay-
ment to pay-for-performance models.

> Chronic kidney disease and transplantation:
We want to provide patients with holistic care along their
entire treatment path. To this end, we have extended our
value-based care programs to include the treatment of
chronic kidney disease with a view to slowing disease progres-
sion, enabling a smoother start to dialysis, and preventing

23

unnecessary hospital stays. We also intend to incorporate kid-
ney transplants into value-based care models in the future.

> Future innovations:
Through our subsidiary, Fresenius Medical Care Ventures
GmbH, we invest in start-ups and early-stage companies in
the health care sector with the goal of gaining access to new
and disruptive technologies and treatment concepts for our
core business and complementary assets.

Critical care solutions

The number of patients requiring continuous renal replace-
ment therapy to treat acute kidney failure is set to rise to
1.6 million per year by 2030. We will expand our existing acute
care portfolio to include other extracorporeal critical care ther-
apy areas, such as the treatment of acute heart, lung and
multi-organ failure.

Complementary assets

We will supplement and strengthen our existing network where
feasible through additional partnerships, investments and
acquisitions. This will help us to create medical value added
while saving costs, enabling us to build an even more solid
foundation for our future growth to 2025 and beyond.

Global Sustainability Program

For us, sustainability is about being successful in the long term
and creating lasting value - economically, ecologically and
socially. Our Global Sustainability Program will allow us to step
up our efforts to integrate sustainability into our business
activities over the next three years. For example, we have intro-
duced sustainability as a non-financial performance target for
compensation. In November 2020, we were recognized for the

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

ith time as a sustainability leader with inclusion in the Dow
Jones Sustainability Index (DJS! Europe).

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM

The Management Board oversees our Company by setting stra-
tegic and operational targets and measuring various financial
key performance indicators used for internal management
determined in euro based upon IFRS.

The key performance indicators used for internal management
are identical in the individual operating segments.

Each operating segment is evaluated based on target figures
that reflect the revenue and expenses they control. The effects
of certain transactions and income taxes are not included as we
believe these items to be outside the operating segments’ con-
trol. Financing is a corporate function, which the operating seg-
ments do not control. Therefore, we do not include interest
expense relating to financing as an operating segment mea-
surement. Similarly, we do not allocate certain costs which
relate primarily to certain headquarters’ overhead charges,
including Accounting and Finance, certain Legal costs, Global
Research and Development, GMQS and costs attributable to
the Global Medical Office, because we believe that these costs
are also not within the control of the individual operating seg-
ments.

Certain of the following key performance indicators and other
financial information as well as discussions and analyses set
out in this report include measures that are not defined by IFRS
(Non-IFRS Measure). We believe this information, along with
comparable IFRS financial measurements, is useful to our
investors as it provides a basis for assessing our performance,
payment obligations related to performance-based compensa-
tion, our compliance with financial covenants and enhanced
transparency as well as comparability of our results. Non-IFRS
financial measures should not be viewed or interpreted as a

24

substitute for financial information presented in accordance
with IFRS.

Some key performance indicators and other financial mea-
sures used in this report such as changes in revenue, operating
income and net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG
& Co. KGaA (or “net income”) include the impact of translating
local currencies to our reporting currency for financial report-
ing purposes. We calculate these Non-IFRS financial measures
at constant exchange rates in our publications to show changes
in our revenue, operating income, net income attributable to
shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and other items without
giving effect to period-to-period currency fluctuations. Under
IFRS, amounts received in local (non-euro) currency are trans-
lated into euro at the average exchange rate for the period pre-
sented. Once we translate the local currency for the constant
currency, we then calculate the change, as a percentage, of the
current period calculated using the prior period exchange
rates versus the prior period. This resulting percentage is a
Non-IFRS Measure referring to a change as a percentage at
constant currency. These currency-adjusted financial mea-
sures are identifiable by the designated terms “Constant
Exchange Rates” or “Constant Currency.”

We believe that the measures at Constant Currency are useful
to investors, lenders and other creditors because such informa-
tion enables them to gauge the impact of currency fluctuations
on our revenue, operating income, net income attributable to
shareholders of FMC AG &Co. KGaA and other items from
period to period. In addition, under our long-term incentive
plans, we measure the attainment of certain pre-determined
financial targets for revenue growth and net income growth in
Constant Currency. However, we limit our use of Constant Cur-
rency period-over-period changes to a measure for the impact
of currency fluctuations on the translation of local currency
into euro. We do not evaluate our results and performance
without considering both:

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

1. Period-over-period changes in revenue, operating income,
net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co.
KGaA and other items prepared in accordance with IFRS and

2. Constant Currency changes in revenue, operating income,
net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co.
KGaA and other items.

We caution the readers of this report not to consider these key
measures in isolation, but to review them in conjunction with
changes in revenue, operating income, net income attributable
to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and other items pre-
pared in accordance with IFRS. We present the growth rate
derived from non-IFRS measures next to the growth rate
derived from IFRS measures such as revenue, operating income,
net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA
and other items. As the reconciliation is inherent in the disclo-
sure included within “Results of operations, financial position
and net assets” starting on PAGE 45, we believe that a separate
reconciliation would not provide any additional benefit.

Revenue growth

The management of our operating segments is based on reve-
nue growth as a key performance indicator. We believe that the
key to continue growing our revenue is to attract new patients
and increase the number of treatments performed each year.
The number of treatments performed each year is therefore an
indicator of continued revenue growth. For further information
regarding revenue recognition and measurement, refer to
NOTE 1K of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Rev-
enue growth is also benchmarked based on movement at Con-
stant Exchange Rates.

Net income growth at Constant Currency
(Non-IFRS Measure)

On a consolidated level, percentage growth in net income (net
income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA) at
Constant Currency is an additional key performance indicator
used for internal management.

Basic earnings per share growth at
Constant Currency (Non-IFRS Measure)

Percentage growth in basic earnings per share at Constant Cur-
rency is a key performance indicator to evaluate our profitabil-
ity. This indicator helps to manage our overall performance.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income
attributable to shareholders by the weighted-average number
of outstanding shares over the course of the year.

Capital expenditures, acquisitions and
investments

We manage our investments using a detailed coordination and
evaluation process. The Management Board sets our complete
investment budget as well as the investment targets. Before
realizing specific investment projects or acquisitions, our inter-
nal Acquisition & Investment Committee examines the individ-
ual projects and measures considering the expected return on
investment and potential yield. Investment projects are evalu-
ated using common methods such as net present value, inter-
nal interest rate methods and payback periods. We utilize this
evaluation methodology to ensure that we only make and
implement investments and acquisitions that increase share-
holder value. Capital expenditures for property, plant and
equipment and capitalized development costs is an indicator
used for internal management. It influences the capital invested
for replacement and expansion.

26

Cash flow measures

Net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities in % of revenue

Our consolidated statement of cash flows indicates how we
generated and used cash and cash equivalents. In conjunction
with our other primary financial statements, it provides infor-
mation that helps us evaluate changes to our net assets and
our financial structure (including liquidity and solvency). Net
cash provided by (used in) operating activities is applied to
assess whether a business can internally generate the cash
required to make the necessary replacement and expansion of
investments. This indicator is impacted by the profitability of
our business and the development of working capital, mainly
receivables. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
in percent of revenue shows the percentage of our revenue
that is available in terms of financial resources. It is an indicator
of our operating financial strength.

Free cash flow in % of revenue
(Non-IFRS Measure)

Free cash flow (which we define as net cash provided by (used
in) operating activities after capital expenditures, before acqui-
sitions and investments) refers to the cash flow we have at our
disposal, including cash flows that may be restricted for other
uses. This indicator shows the percentage of revenue available
for acquisitions and investments, dividends to shareholders,
reducing debt financing or for repurchasing shares.

TABLE 2.6 shows the cash flow key performance indicators for
2020 and 2019 and reconciles free cash flow and free cash flow
in percent of revenue to net cash provided by (used in) operat-
ing activities and net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities in percent of revenue, respectively.

Net leverage ratio (Non-IFRS Measure)

The net leverage ratio is a key performance indicator used for
internal management. To determine the net leverage ratio,
debt and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents (net
debt) is compared to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before inter-
est, taxes, depreciation and amortization) (adjusted for acquisi-
tions and divestitures made during the year with a purchase
price above a €50 M threshold as defined in the Amended 2012
Credit Agreement, non-cash charges and impairment loss). The
ratio is an indicator of the length of time the Company needs to
service the net debt out of its own resources. We believe that
the net leverage ratio provides alternative information that
management believes to be useful in assessing our ability to
meet our payment obligations in addition to considering the
absolute amount of our debt. We have a strong market position
in a growing, global and mainly non-cyclical market. Further-
more, most of our customers have a high credit rating as the
dialysis industry is characterized by stable and sustained cash

® Acquisitions and divestitures made for the last twelve months with a purchase price above a
€50 M threshold as defined in the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement (2019: -€71 M), transaction
costs related to the acquisition of NxStage Medical Inc. (NxStage) on February 21, 2019
(2019: €95 M) (NxStage Costs), non-cash charges, primarily related to pension expense
(2020: €50 M; 2019: €46 M), and impairment loss (2020: €199 M; 2019: €40 M).

Return on invested capital (ROIC)
(Non-IFRS Measure)

ROIC is the ratio of operating income after tax (“net operating
profit after tax” or "NOPAT") to the average invested capital of
the last five quarter closing dates, including adjustments for

acquisitions and divestitures made during the year with a pur-
chase price above a €50 M threshold as defined in the Amended
2012 Credit Agreement, and expresses how efficiently we allo-
cate the capital under our control or how well we employ our
capital with regard to investment projects. Additionally, we
have excluded the impairment of goodwill and trade names in
the Latin America Segment driven by a macro-economic down-
turn and increasing risk adjustment rates for certain countries
in the region (Impairment Loss) (SEE NOTE 2 A of the notes to
the consolidated financial statements) to increase comparabil-
ity of the underlying financial figures of certain Management
Board compensation performance targets with the Company's
operating performance and to adequately recognize the actual
performance of the members of the Management Board. An
adjustment to exclude amounts related to the implementation
of IFRS 16, Leases, which replaced the straight-line operating
lease expense for former leases under International Account-
ing Standard 17, Leases, with a depreciation charge for the
lease asset and an interest expense on the lease liability as well
as the classification of certain IAS 17 leases (such effects being,
collectively “Effect from IFRS 16") is included for the purpose
of increasing the comparability of previously reported informa-
tion in accordance with our long-term incentive plans in 2019
(see the Compensation Report starting on PAGE 124 for addi-
tional information regarding these adjustments).

TABLES 2.8 UNTIL 2.17 STARTING ON PAGE 28 are showing the
reconciliation of average invested capital to total assets, which
we believe to be the most directly comparable IFRS financial
measure, and how ROIC is calculated.

mance indicators.

Operating performance excluding special
items (Non-IFRS Measure)

Management believes that there are special items which should
be excluded from certain metrics to enhance transparency and
comparability. In the presentation of the expected development
of our business in our outlook, we identified special items
which, when excluded from the results disclosed, may provide a
reader with further useful information in assessing our perfor-
mance. These results excluding special items are presented as
part of the comparison of the actual business results with the
outlook and in our outlook, together with reconciliations of the
key indicators for our consolidated financial statements pre-
pared in accordance with IFRS to the key indicators excluding
special items. These results excluding special items should only
be viewed as a supplement to our results disclosed in accor-
dance with IFRS.

Changes to the internal
management system

In 2021, the internal management system will be updated due
to adjustments in the remuneration of the Management Board
and the way in which the Management Board will manage and
represent the Company in the future. As a result, we have also
adjusted the primary financial key performance indicators of
the internal management system and included these metrics in
our outlook for the 2021 financial year.

Based on these changes, operating income margin, Delivered
Operating Income (Non-IFRS Measure), basic earnings per
share growth at Constant Currency (Non-IFRS Measure), capi-
tal expenditures, net cash provided by (used in) operating activ-
ities in % of revenue, free cash flow in % of revenue (Non-IFRS
Measure) and net leverage ratio (Non-IFRS Measure) will no
longer be used as financial key performance indicators for
internal management from January 1, 2021.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and free
cash flow as well as in % of revenue, capital expenditures and
net leverage ratio (as described above) will continue to be
included as secondary financial performance indicators, while
Delivered Operating Income will no longer be reported as a
financial performance indicator in future periods.

As a result, we are introducing new financial key performance
indicators, which will be used for internal management and
reported externally alongside the previous financial key perfor-
mance indicators. In addition to revenue and net income
growth as defined above, management will now focus on the
absolute amount of revenue and net income to manage our
business. Revenue and net income are also benchmarked based
on Constant Exchange Rates. For the purposes of management
compensation, these metrics are also benchmarked at the
underlying exchange rates used in the calculation of our incen-
tive compensation targets.

Primary key performance indicators for internal management
from 2021 onwards are as follows:

> revenue
> revenue growth

> operating income
> net income

> net income growth
> ROIC

These metrics, with the exception of ROIC, will be presented
both in accordance with IFRS and at Constant Currency. ROIC
and each of these indicators presented at Constant Currency is
considered a non-IFRS measure.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Outlook
Risks and Opportunities Report
Corporate Governance fundamentals

Developing innovative products and continuously improving
our renal therapies are intrinsic elements of our growth strat-
egy. Our worldwide research and development activities, which
are centrally managed by the Global Research and Develop-
ment division (GRD), enable us to develop products and renal
therapies efficiently and to systematically promote the
exchange of knowledge and technology between regions.

Global research and development strategy

Health care systems face major financial challenges. We aim to
direct our research and development activities toward develop-
ing innovative products and renal therapies that not only meet
high quality standards that improve clinical outcomes, but are
also affordable. As an operator of proprietary dialysis clinics
and a provider of products for treating patients at home, we
believe that these aims are entirely compatible. We are also in
a strong position to provide life-saving therapies and treat-
ments to patients suffering from acute kidney failure due to
COVID-19.

Our research and development strategy contributes to our
strategy 2025 which aims to provide health care for chronically
and critically ill patients across the renal care continuum, in
critical settings and by acquiring and developing complemen-
tary assets. It is globally orientated, enabling us to respond
even better to the worldwide rise in demand for high-quality
yet cost-efficient treatment and therapy methods. In doing so,
we also take regional market conditions into account and offer
a differentiated product range across all three key areas of our
strategy 2025 (see chapter "Corporate strategy and objec-
tives” starting on PAGE 22).

In the future, we intend to deliver innovative, competitive prod-
ucts even more efficiently and strengthen our focus on devel-

34

oping countries. In addition to research and development activ-
ities within our Company, we collaborate with external partners
with the aim of building a comprehensive innovation and tech-
nology network. These partners include numerous academic
institutions, such as research institutes at prestigious universi-
ties in the U.S. Another partner is the Renal Research Institute
in New York. This subsidiary of Fresenius Medical Care North
America is a renowned institution in the field of clinical research
into all aspects of chronic kidney failure. Together, we are work-
ing on fundamental issues relating to renal therapies. We are
also increasingly collaborating with start-ups with the objective
of promoting an open culture of innovation and enabling access
to the latest technologies.

Innovations in 2020

Our aim is to continuously improve our patients’ quality of life
and the outcomes of their treatment as well as to ensure our
growth in the medium to long term. To this end, we are not only
working on new products that are close to market launch, but
also on an extensive portfolio of innovation projects. These
focus on technologies in our core business as well as related
areas of strategic interest.

The next generation of dialyzers

In 2020, we started by introducing our next-generation hemo-
dialysis and hemodiafiltration dialyzer FX CorAL in EMEA. It
incorporates an innovative fiber membrane design, Helixone
hydro®, made using novel fiber production processes. The inner
lumen of Helixone hydro® fibers mimics the blood’s natural
environment, lowering the risk of an immunological reaction.
This has the potential to result in better tolerability for our
patients. We expect a full launch in 2021.

Our Optiflux® Enexa™ F500 with Endexo® technology is a new
dialyzer designed to support the treatment of patients without

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

the need for heparin. Endexo is a surface-modifying polymer
that is added to the dialyzer during manufacturing. It makes
the surface of the membrane less thrombogenic, so that the
blood is less likely to clot. The Optiflux® Enexa™ F500 was
recently given FDA 510(k) clearance and thus has passed a key
hurdle prior to market launch. It is now in the last stage of
development before being marketed in the U.S.

New home dialysis system launched

For many patients, peritoneal dialysis is the dialysis treatment
modality of choice and the gentlest option during the first
years of renal replacement therapy. The new SILENCIA® Auto-
mated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) therapy system, due to be
launched in 2021, promises affordable, state-of the-art dialysis
quality for peritoneal dialysis patients, especially in emerging
markets. The robust, functional design of the cycler ensures a
quick set-up and easy operation. It allows silent and reliable
treatment at night while the patient sleeps.

System for respiratory or
cardiopulmonary support

In February 2020, Novalung®, a system that can be used for
respiratory or cardiopulmonary support, received approval
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The sys-
tem is distributed in the U.S. under the name Novalung® sys-
tem and in other countries as Xenios® Console with various
treatment kits.

Novalung® is the first extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
system approved for more than six hours of use as a life sup-
porting therapy in the U.S. It provides assisted extracorporeal
circulation and physiologic gas exchange, such as oxygenation
and CO, removal.

Patients are often unable to absorb sufficient oxygen into their
bloodstream or excrete carbon dioxide from their bodies, lead-
ing to acute oxygen deficiency. The system maintains the
patient's blood circulation and supplies the blood outside the
body with oxygen, relieving the heart and lungs.

Digital health care

Connectivity is a key element of our development strategy to
support the expansion of home therapies. Patients who are in
close contact with their clinicians are less likely to be hospital-
ized. As more patients are treated at home, it is essential for us
to optimize workflows for clinicians and reduce the burden for
patients. To this end, Fresenius Medical Care launched its
Kinexus™ Therapy Management Service, a cloud-based home
patient management solution, in Chile and the U.S in 2020. Its
features include remote dialysis monitoring, treatment work-
flow management, personalized prescription programming,
and daily treatment reporting to clinicians. Kinexus™ allows us
to improve patients’ home therapy experience and support
those caring for them, with the goal of keeping them at home
for longer.

Optimizing therapies through analytics

Modern analytical tools open up new opportunities for enhanc-
ing and automating the end-to-end delivery of dialysis treat-
ments. They can be used to determine the optimal treatment
for individual patients and to automate the respective treat-
ment sequence. Moreover, these tools make it possible to not
only evaluate the vital parameters of patients but also to mon-
itor and optimize the functional state of machines or related
services. Fresenius Medical Care Data Solutions Care GmbH is
working on these approaches and solutions with the aim of
allowing physicians to focus even more on patients and the
course of the disease itself.

Research in the field
of regenerative medicine

We are investing in promising technologies and research
approaches in the area of regenerative medicine through our
affiliate Unicyte AG as well as our subsidiary Fresenius Medical
Care Ventures GmbH.

Our venture capital company is increasingly collaborating with
start-ups with the aim of promoting an open culture of innova-
tion and gaining access to the latest technologies. While our
portfolio company, Corvidia, was acquired by a major pharma-
ceutical company in 2020, during the year we invested in the
following two companies:

> Alucent Biomedical (Alucent) is a privately held medical
technology company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Alucent was founded by Avera Health to develop and market
products using Alucent Natural Vascular Scaffolding (Alu-
centNVS) technology. AlucentNVS is a first-of-its-kind com-
bination drug-device therapy designed to assist the body in
naturally opening and maintaining arterial patency.

> Magenta Medical (Magenta) is a privately owned medical
device company based in Kadima, Israel. Magenta is working
on a next-generation percutaneous left ventricular assistive
device and a transcatheter renal venous decongestion device.

Research and development resources

In fiscal year 2020, Fresenius Medical Care spent a total of
around €194 M on research and development (2019: €168 M),
corresponding to around 5 % (2019: 5 %) of our health care
product revenue. At the end of 2020, our patent portfolio
comprised some 11,223 property rights in approximately
1,626 patent families, ie. groups of patents linked to the same
invention. Our research and development work in fiscal year
2020 produced around 135 additional patent families. Our

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

broad portfolio of patents shall provide us with a wide range of
treatment options in this highly competitive field in the future.

At December 31, 2020, 1,218 employees (full-time equivalents)
worked for Fresenius Medical Care in research and develop-
ment worldwide (December 31, 2019: 1,157). They come from
various backgrounds: Physicians work side by side with soft-
ware specialists, business economists and engineers in inter-
disciplinary teams. More than 730 employees - the majority of
our research and development staff - are based in Europe. Most
research and development activities are carried out at our
facilities in Schweinfurt and Bad Homburg v.d. Héhe (Ger-
many). Other development sites are in St. Wendel (Germany),
Bucharest (Romania) and Krems (Austria). In the U.S., the Com-
pany maintains centers of excellence for the development of
devices in Concord (California) and for dialyzers and other dis-
posable products in Ogden (Utah). Development activities in
Shanghai and Changshu (China) are focused on the growing
demand for cost-effective dialysis systems in Asia and emerg-
ing markets. The Global Research and Development organiza-
tion coordinates collaboration and technology exchange among
the various sites. Carrying out research and development
responsibly is an intrinsic element of our innovative culture.

EMPLOYEES

Fresenius Medical Care owes its business success to the com-
mitment of its employees. At a functional level, our human
resources management is conducted globally to ensure a uni-
form strategic approach in line with the overriding corporate
objectives.

At December 31, 2020, Fresenius Medical Care employed a total
of 125,364 members of staff (full-time equivalents) in 67 coun-
tries worldwide. Our workforce therefore increased by 4%
year-on-year, or by 4,705 employees in absolute terms. This
was mainly due to organic business growth and acquisitions,
both of which were impacted by COVID-19 related personnel
requirements.

TABLE 2.20 shows the breakdown of employees by operating
segment as well as by products and services.

Staff costs at Fresenius Medical Care increased to €7,067 M in
2020 (2019: €6,799 M), corresponding to 40 % (2019: 39 %) of
revenue. Average staff costs per employee (annual average
based on full-time equivalents) amounted to €56,770 (2019:
€56,740).

QUALITY MANAGEMENT

Outlook
Risks and Opportunities Report
Corporate Governance fundamentals

At Fresenius Medical Care, we have a clear focus: we want to
offer high-quality and reliable products and therapies to ensure
the best possible medical care for our patients and customers.
We operate production facilities worldwide to meet the demand
for our dialysis products and other health care products.

Quality management at our
production sites

Over the last several years, GMQS has introduced a stable infra-
structure with efficient processes and systems. All production
sites follow the “Lean Manufacturing” approach which, in our
North America Segment and our Schweinfurt plant, includes
the “Lean Six Sigma" management system. The focus of Lean
Manufacturing and Six Sigma is on the continuous improve-
ment of manufacturing processes to achieve a low defect rate
resulting in improved product quality, while reducing manufac-
turing times. We have successfully harmonized all local Quality
Management Systems (QMS) in all manufacturing and develop-
ment sites of our EMEA Segment, Latin America Segment and
Asia-Pacific Segment under one Consolidated QMS (CQMS).
Every medical device plant within these segments has a local
QMS directed by CQMS that is certified either to ISO 13485:2016
and/or ISO 9001:2015. The QMS of each site is reviewed
through periodic management review, internal corporate and
internal local audits.

Quality management in our dialysis clinics

Our clinics work in conformance with the generally accepted
quality standards of the industry, particularly the U.S. Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, the
European Renal Best Practice standard, and increasingly the
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), an indus-
try initiative for global clinical practice guidelines. Clinical data

37

Management systems are used to routinely collect certain
medical parameters, which we evaluate in anonymized form in
compliance with these guidelines.

More information about our quality management including our
quality data can be found in the Non-Financial Group Report
starting on PAGE 80.

Quality-based reimbursement systems

We participate in quality-based reimbursement models, which
we describe in the section “Health care and reimbursement
systems vary from country to country” in the chapter “Eco-
nomic Report” starting on PAGE 38.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT

Operating on a global scale means having global responsibility.
Fresenius Medical Care is aware of this responsibility.

Over the past years, we have continuously stepped up our sus-
tainability activities. We have launched a Global Sustainability
Program to further drive the integration of sustainability into
our business.

Acting in a responsible and sustainable manner is a fundamen-
tal component of our strategy; it secures our future as a glob-
ally operating company in the health care industry.

ECONOMIC REPORT

The dialysis market is a sustainable growth market
with steadily rising demand for products and ser-
vices to treat patients with chronic kidney disease.

Outlook
Risks and Opportunities Report
Corporate Governance fundamentals

MACROECONOMIC AND SECTOR-
SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT

Macroeconomic environment
Dependency on economic cycles

Our business is exposed to economic cycles only to a relatively
small extent. This sets us apart from manufacturers of con-
sumer goods, for instance, whose products are subject to more
cyclical demand.

Our business is impacted more by government reimbursement
rates and remuneration systems. Dialysis is a vital medical ser-
vice, which is why it is usually paid for by the responsible health
care system.

Overall, the rapid global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic
resulted in a material deterioration of the conditions for the
global economy and greatly reduced economic growth. The
conditions also changed for our business in fiscal year 2020.
Nonetheless, this development shows that our vertically inte-
grated business model can be viewed as solid and resilient
during the crisis.

Exchange rate developments

The global exchange rate developments in fiscal year 2020
were characterized by a strengthening of the euro against the

38

U.S. dollar, as well as partly stronger fluctuations in the
emerging economies. Some currencies in emerging econo-
mies in particular depreciated significantly against the euro
and the U.S. dollar. As Fresenius Medical Care has a worldwide
presence, the results of its operations are impacted by
exchange rate developments. Movements in the U.S. dollar
and the euro are especially crucial as we generate a major
part of our revenues in the U.S. On average over the course of
the year, the euro traded slightly stronger against the U.S.
dollar compared to fiscal year 2019.

In addition, Fresenius Medical Care’s operating results are
influenced by changes in the exchange rate between the euro
and local currencies. This is partly due to intra-Group sales
from large production sites in the euro zone to Group compa-
nies with different functional currencies, but also because the
euro is the currency we use for financial reporting. Regarding
intra-Group sales, individual subsidiaries are exposed to fluc-
tuations in the exchange rate between the invoicing curren-
cies and the currencies in which they conduct their local oper-
ations. Fresenius Medical Care reduces transaction risks, i.e.
risks from foreign currency exposures or exchange rate fluc-
tuations, through a global network of production facilities,
which is geared toward demand in the Company's dialysis
product business. As the production facilities are often based
in the markets they serve, costs are incurred in the same cur-
rency in which revenue is generated. The risk of exchange
rate fluctuations is relatively low for health care services
because they are provided locally and are therefore invoiced
in the respective currency.

Sector-specific environment

Chronic kidney failure (end-stage renal disease, ESRD) is a
global disease. The number of patients requiring renal replace-
ment therapy is increasing worldwide: At the end of 2020,
approximately 4.5 M patients underwent dialysis treatment or

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

received a donor organ. Further information can be found in
TABLE 2.21.

Home hemodialysis 23,000 1%

Source: Company information and estimates.

For many years now, the number of donated organs worldwide
has been significantly lower than the number of patients on
transplant waiting lists. Despite extensive efforts by regional
initiatives to increase awareness of kidney donation and the
willingness to donate, the share of patients receiving kidney
transplantation compared with other treatment methods has
remained relatively unchanged over the past ten years.

The prevalence of chronic kidney failure varies between

regions. There are several reasons for this:

> The countries differ demographically, as age structures in the
population vary worldwide.

> The prevalence of risk factors for kidney disease, such as dia-
betes and high blood pressure, varies widely.

> The genetic predisposition for kidney disease also differs sig-
nificantly around the world.

> Access to dialysis remains restricted in many countries,
meaning that many patients suffering from chronic kidney
failure are not treated and therefore do not appear in preva-
lence statistics.

> Cultural factors, such as nutrition, play a role.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Outlook
Risks and Opportunities Report
Corporate Governance fundamentals

The number of dialysis patients rose by around 3 % in 2020.
The decrease compared to our previously expected growth rate
of approximately 6 % for dialysis patients in 2020 is primarily
caused by COVID-19 related excess mortality of ESRD patients.

Comparison of dialysis treatment methods

In 2020, most dialysis patients were treated in one of more
than 46,000 dialysis centers worldwide, with an average of
more than 75 patients per center. However, this figure varies
considerably from country to country.

Hemodialysis is by far the most common form of therapy for
chronic kidney failure. A total of 88 % of dialysis patients were
treated in this way at a dialysis center in 2020. Home hemodi-
alysis is an alternative to treatment at a dialysis center.
Although take-up has been limited to date, the number of home
hemodialysis patients is rising continuously. A total of 1% of all
patients are currently treated in this way. In the year under
review, 11 % of all dialysis patients were treated with peritoneal
dialysis, usually at home. As a result, 12% of the dialysis
patients were treated with home dialysis.

CHART 2.22 shows a comparison of in-center and home dialysis.
Volume of the dialysis market

According to our estimates, the volume of the global dialysis
market increased to around €82 BN in 2020. We expect the fol-
lowing approximate breakdown for this market volume: around
€15 BN for dialysis products and approximately €67 BN for dial-
ysis services (including dialysis drugs).

Care Coordination

Chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
eases are becoming increasingly common and are responsible
for approximately two out of three deaths worldwide. In many
countries, a large proportion of health care spending goes
toward treating chronic diseases. To counteract the resultant
increase in cost pressure, more and more health care systems,
such as that in our largest market, the U.S., are starting to
promote coordinated, holistic care rather than reimbursing
individual services.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

Due to the large number of different services offered in the
area of Care Coordination, we cannot provide a meaningful
estimate of the market volume. We currently offer medical ser-
vices in Care Coordination primarily in the North America and
Asia-Pacific Segments and have adapted our services in this
area to these markets. The extent to which we roll out our Care
Coordination services outside the U.S. may vary in individual
countries and regions depending on the respective reimburse-
ment system and market environment.

Our customers are mostly health insurers
and companies

Fresenius Medical Care's most important customers are state-
owned or public health insurers, private health insurers, and
companies.

Health care and reimbursement systems
vary from country to country

As renal replacement therapy is a life-saving medical service,
patients often do not have to pay for dialysis themselves.
Instead, the costs are borne by the responsible health care
system. The reimbursement systems for dialysis treatment - in
other words, the structures used by health care systems to reg-
ulate reimbursement for dialysis services - differ from country
to country and sometimes even within countries. The business
activities of dialysis service providers and the reimbursement
of dialysis therapy are affected by various factors including
regional conditions, the treatment method, regulatory issues,
and the type of provider (public or private).

Our ability to influence the reimbursement of our services is
limited. The environment for reimbursement and the condi-
tions for prescribing ancillary services significantly influence
our business.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Outlook
Risks and Opportunities Report
Corporate Governance fundamentals

The reimbursement system in the U.S.

In the U.S., our biggest market, most of our patients are insured
by the governmental health authority, the so-called Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). In fiscal year 2020, around 32 %
of our revenue was attributable to reimbursements by CMS,
which also determines the reimbursement rates for its patients
(Medicare / Medicaid patients).

Due to pressure to reduce health care costs, increases in the
reimbursement rate were limited in the U.S. in the past. As a
consequence, the reimbursement rate set by CMS as part of its
prospective payment system (PPS) for chronic kidney failure
treatments (known as the ESRD PPS rate) barely changed year-
on-year. The ESRD PPS rate for 2020 amounted to $239.33, up
17 % on the 2019 base rate. A reimbursement rate of $253.13
per treatment has been determined for 2021 and includes a
productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 1.6 %. While
this represents a 5.8 % increase on the 2020 base rate, the
majority of the increase is attributable to the inclusion of calci-
mimetic drugs in the base rate beginning in 2021. From 2018
through 2020, CMS reimbursed dialysis facilities through the
Transitional Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment (TDAPA) for cal-
cimimetic drugs. Using cost and utilization data from Q3 2018
through Q4 2019, CMS has determined that $9.93 should be
added to the base rate to account for calcimimetic drug use
going forward. Beginning in 2021, dialysis facilities will be
expected to provide calcimimetic drugs to patients without an
additional add-on payment.

Any significant reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates
could have a material adverse effect on our health care ser-
vices business. As demand for dialysis products is affected by
Medicare reimbursement rates, this could have consequences
for the development of our product business. To the extent that
inflation, for example in the form of higher costs for personnel
and disposables, is not fully compensated by an increase in

40

reimbursement rates, our business and results of operations
may also be adversely affected.

More information can be found in the “Results of operations,
financial position and net assets” section starting on PAGE 45
and in the report on risks and opportunities starting on PAGE 62.

In the U.S., reimbursement by private insurers and managed
care organizations is higher than reimbursement by govern-
ment institutions. At the same time, payments from private
insurers constitute a substantial portion of our profits, mean-
ing our business is directly influenced by changes in the share
of reimbursements by private insurers in North America. In fis-
cal year 2020, 36 % of the Group's health care revenue was
related to private insurers in the North America Segment.

Transitional add-on payments for new drugs and devices
in the U.S.

Under the ESRD PPS drug designation process, CMS provides
payment using a TDAPA for new renal dialysis drugs and bio-
logicals with the exception of drugs that are available only in
oral forms. For drug and biologicals that fit into an existing
ESRD PPS functional category, CMS will pay for the drug using
the TDAPA for two years. At the end of the transitional period,
CMS will not update the base rate to reflect the cost and utiliza-
tion of the new drug. For new drugs and biologicals that do not
fit into an existing functional category, CMS will pay for the
drug using the TDAPA for a period of at least two years to allow
for sufficient gathering of cost and utilization data. At the con-
clusions of the transitional period, CMS would update the base
rate to reflect the inclusion of the new drug or biological.

Beginning in 2021, CMS will also make transitional add-on pay-
ments for certain new and innovative dialysis equipment and
supplies (TPNIES) approved after January 1, 2020 and provided
by dialysis facilities. These new equipment and supplies must

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

satisfy defined material clinical improvement criteria and will
be reimbursed at 65 % of the invoice price, as determined by
each Medicare Administrative Contractor. Applications for the
TPNIES are due by February 1 of the year prior to the add-on
payment year. For 2021, CMS reviewed two TPNIES applica-
tions. Nether application was approved and there will be no
TPNIES payment for 2021.

The TPNIES does not apply to equipment that constitute a cap-
ital asset such as dialysis machines or water purification sys-
tems. Beginning in 2022, however, CMS will make transitional
add-on payments for capital equipment that are home dialysis
machines used for the treatment of a single patient. Applica-
tions for the home dialysis machine transitional payment for
2022 are due by February 2021.

Quality-based reimbursement

The health care debate in some countries is currently focused
on establishing reimbursement structures based on treatment
quality (pay for performance). This transfers more responsibil-
ity to the medical service provider. The goal of reimbursement
models of this kind is to maintain a high quality of care com-
bined with lower overall costs for the health care system.

The reimbursement system in the U.S. is also an example of a
model based on qualitative criteria. For example, CMS defines
quality standards for dialysis centers as part of its quality
improvement program (QIP). Failure to reach these standards
can lead to a reduction in annual reimbursements of up to 2 %.

Reimbursement in a value-based environment in the U.S.

We are also working closely with CMS in the area of value-based
care. One example is our participation in a CMS ESRD care
model: To improve the health of patients with chronic kidney
failure while reducing costs for CMS, dialysis providers and phy-

sicians can join forces to form entities known as ESCOs (End-
Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Seamless Care Organizations). We
are currently participating in 23 ESCOs in this pilot project.
ESCOs that fulfill the minimum quality standards specified by
the program while generating reductions in the cost of care
above certain thresholds for dialysis patients covered by the
model receive a portion of the cost savings as reimbursement.
ESCOs that involve dialysis chains with more than 200 clinics
are required to share in the risk of cost increases and reim-
burse part of any such increases to CMS if the actual costs
exceed the agreed thresholds. Approximately 43,700 patients
participated in our ESCOs as of December 1, 2020. In 2020,
CMS gave each ESCO the option to extend their participation in
the program through March 31, 2021, and/or to accept certain
financial changes. Fresenius Medical Care will continue to par-
ticipate in the ESCO program.

We have also concluded agreements on per capita reimburse-
ments (subcapitations) as well as risk-based and value-based
agreements with certain insurers, which form the basis for the
health care services we offer to private and Medicare Advan-
tage patients with chronic kidney failure. These agreements
determine a basic amount per patient per month. If we provide
complete care at a cost below this amount, we retain the differ-
ence. However, if the cost of complete care exceeds the basic
amount, we may be obliged to pay the difference to the insurer.

2019 Executive Order on new reimbursement models

On July 10, 2019, the U.S. President signed an Executive Order
(EO) on advancing kidney health. Among other things, the EO
directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to
develop new Medicare reimbursement models that enable diag-
nosis and treatment earlier in the course of kidney disease and
support the expansion of home dialysis as well as promoting
kidney transplants. One of these, the ESRD Treatment Choices
Model (ETC Model), is mandatory and creates financial incen-

41

tives for home dialysis treatments and kidney transplants. Due
to start in January 2021 and end in June 2026, the ETC Model
consists of two partial reimbursement programs: on the one
hand it envisages increases to the reimbursement for home
dialysis treatments for a period of three years, on the other
hand a performance-based reimbursement adjustment on all
dialysis claims. The performance-based reimbursement adjust-
ment is based on the rates of home dialysis and kidney trans-
plants and will amount to between -5 and +4 % in the first year
of reimbursement and between -10 and +8 % in the final year.
Performance based payment adjustments are scheduled to
start in July 2022 and run for six and a half years. Participants
in the model are selected at random. As at December 2020,
975 U.S. dialysis clinics, representing approximately 35 % of
our dialysis clinics, were selected for participation in the model.

The Executive Order also announced voluntary Medicare reim-
bursement models aimed at providing financial incentives for
health care providers in the area of chronic kidney disease and
transplantation. Our applications for the voluntary Compre-
hensive Kidney Care Contracting (CKCC) model were accepted
in June 2020. This model allows health care providers to
assume various amounts of financial risk by forming so-called
Kidney Care Entities (KCE). Of the 29 accepted applications,
27 KCEs have elected to participate in the implementation
period, which started on October 15, 2020. During a start-up
period, the KCE is not at financial risk. Each KCE must decide
before April 1, 2021, whether to continue its participation includ-
ing financial accountability in the first performance year from
April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Once implemented, the
CKCC model is expected to run through 2025.

Changes related to the Affordable Care Act
The delivery of health care services and products is highly

regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. Pro-
posals for legislative reforms in these countries are often

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

introduced to improve access to care, address quality of care
issues, and manage costs of the health care system. In the
U.S., the Trump administration publicly announced its desire
to pursue significant changes to existing health care pro-
grams. This has included the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also
known as Obamacare, which regulates access to health insur-
ance in the U.S.

In October 2017, the Trump administration discontinued making
cost-sharing reduction (CSR) reimbursements to insurers,
arguing that the Congress had failed to appropriate funding for
them. These subsidies reduce deductibles, coinsurance, and
copayments for individuals and families at or below 250 % of
the federal poverty level. Under the law insurers are still man-
dated to provide lower out-of-pocket costs for low-income indi-
viduals; as a result, ending CSR payments has caused many
insurers to increase premiums in the individual insurance mar-
ket to offset the loss of the federal support. This occurred in
part through so-called “silver loading”, a practice whereby the
premiums for silver level plans were increased.

In its financial year 2019, 2020, and 2021 budget proposals,
the Trump administration altered course and requested
authority to fund CSR payments. Neither the financial year
2019, 2020, nor 2021 CSR budget proposal was ultimately
included in appropriations authorized by the Congress, and
we cannot predict whether the inclusion of this funding for
2021 will come to pass.

Although that administration's efforts to repeal or replace
ACA were unsuccessful and the Biden Administration has
stated its intention to maintain and strengthen the ACA, the
U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in November 2020
regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. On January 28,
2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Strength-
ening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which directs the
Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Ser-

vices, Treasury and Labor to, among other things, review and
examine policies or practices.

U.S. ballot initiatives

Further U.S. legislation or regulations may be enacted in the
future that could substantially modify the amounts paid for
services and products that we and our subsidiaries offer. They
could also mandate new or alternative operating models and
payment models that could put our health care service opera-
tions at greater risk. Ballot initiatives that are successfully
introduced at state level in the U.S. require the state's citizens
to vote to directly adopt or reject the proposed new legislation.
These ballot initiatives oblige us to spend considerable
resources in order to participate in public discourse. Efforts to
enact new state laws regarding our operations are ongoing.

COVID-19 relief measures

In the U.S., the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (CARES Act) has been passed to mitigate certain adverse
financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in the
health care sector. Additional funding under the CARES Act and
other COVID-19 relief provides some financial support to our
business in the U.S. This includes suspension of the 2 % Medi-
care payment sequestration reduction from May 2020 to March
2021, accelerated and advance payments of Medicare reim-
bursement and grants to cover expenses and mitigate the loss
of revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these
measures may not fully offset any lost revenues and increased
costs we may incur. For further information see the consoli-
dated financials within “Results of operations, financial posi-
tion and net assets” starting on PAGE 45 and NOTE 4 | of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Charitable Premium Assistance

At the end of the Obama administration, the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) issued an Interim Final
Rule (IFR) that limited patients’ ability to use charitable pre-
mium assistance (CPA) to enroll in a private scheme. In 2017,
this IFR was temporarily enjoined after Fresenius Medical
Care (along with DaVita, US Renal, and Dialysis Patients Citi-
zens) sued CMS.

The Trump administration has continued to work on this issue
and sent a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing CPA to
the Office of Management and Budget for review in June 2019.
The proposed rule has not yet been published for comment.
While the rule continues to be reflected in the Department of
Health and Human Services agenda, there has been no indica-
tion whether or when the rule will be released. Instead, there
have been attempts to curtail the usage of CPA or reduce com-
mercial reimbursement for dialysis patients receiving CPA by
state legislatures.

OVERALL BUSINESS
DEVELOPMENT

Highlights
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

Throughout 2020, Fresenius Medical Care reported COVID-19
affecting patients with advanced kidney disease and, in partic-
ular, the severity of illness resulting in an increased mortality.
The excess mortality trend significantly accelerated in the U.S.
and in EMEA in particular in November and December 2020
and accumulated to approximately 10,000 patients in 2020
over the pre-pandemic baseline.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

To be able to continue care for its patients, Fresenius Medical
Care implemented a number of measures, both operational
and financial, to maintain an adequate workforce, protect its
patients and employees through expanded personal protec-
tive equipment protocols, and expenses related to surge
capacity for patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-
19. Additionally, we experienced a loss of revenue due to the
pandemic in certain areas of our business, which was partially
offset by increased demand for our services and products in
other areas.

Governments in various regions in which we operate have pro-
vided economic assistance programs to address the conse-
quences of the pandemic on companies and support healthcare
providers and patients.

After taking into account these COVID-19 reimbursements,
Fresenius Medical Care concluded that COVID-19 resulted in an
immaterial impact to net income attributable to shareholders
of FMC AG & Co. KGaA in 2020.

For more information see the consolidated financials within
“Results of operations, financial position and net assets” start-
ing on PAGE 45 and NOTE 4 | of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

Share buy-back program

In 2020, we continued to utilize the authorization granted by
the Company's Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016 to con-
duct a share buy-back program. Under a share buy-back pro-
gram, announced on June 14, 2019 and concluded on April 1,
2020, we repurchased 10.8 M ordinary shares at a total pur-
chase price (excluding ancillary transaction costs) of €685 M.
These shares were used solely to reduce our registered share
capital by cancellation of the acquired shares. On December 11,
2020, all 11.8 M own shares held were redeemed. For further

Financing

On May 29, 2020, we issued bonds in two tranches with an
aggregate principal amount of €1.25 BN under our Debt Issu-
ance Program: a €500 M bond with a six-year maturity and a
coupon rate of 1.00 % issued at a price of 99.405 % and witha
yield of 1103 %; and a €750 M bond with a ten-year maturity
and a coupon rate of 1.50 % issued at a price of 99.742 % and
with a yield of 1.528 %.

On September 16, 2020, we issued further bonds with a ten-
year maturity and an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 BN.
The bonds have a coupon rate of 2.375 % ad were issued at a
price of 99.699 % with a yield of 2.408 %.

The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
including refinancing of financial liabilities.

Comparison of actual business results
with the outlook

The rapid global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted ina
material deterioration of the conditions for the global econ-
omy. The environment for our business did not evolve as
expected in 2020. Nevertheless, taking into account the gov-
ernmental COVID-19 reimbursements, we concluded that
COVID-19 resulted in an immaterial impact on net income attrib-
utable to shareholders. We largely met our forecasts for the fis-
cal year 2020 despite the COVID-19-pandemic.

Our 2020 outlook included the effects from COVID-19 and
excluded special items. Special items are effects that are
unusual in nature and have not been foreseeable, or not fore-
seeable in size or impact, at the time of giving guidance. There-

43

fore the outlook excluded the Impairment Loss in the Latin
America Segment. Accordingly, we have adjusted for this spe-
cial item the actual results for 2020 to make them comparable
with the outlook.

The growth rates are based on the results in 2019 adjusted for
NxStage costs, costs associated with the sustainable improve-
ment of our cost base (Cost Optimization Costs) and the (Gain)
loss related to divestitures of Care Coordination activities. A
reconciliation of the results 2020 and 2019 to the respective
results 2020 excluding special items and results 2019 adjusted
can be found at the end of this section. The outlook for the fis-
cal year 2020 was based on the prevailing exchange rates at
the beginning of 2020.

We expected revenue growth in the mid to high single digit
range at Constant Currency at the beginning of the year. We
generated revenue of €17.9 BN in 2020. At Constant Currency,
revenue increased by 5 %. We therefore met our expectations
and achieved our outlook.

All operating segments, and especially the North America Seg-
ment contributed to the expansion of our business. Further
details on the development of revenue can be found in the sec-
tion “Results of operation, financial position and net assets”
starting on PAGE 45.

We expected operating income to develop at a mid to high sin-
gle digit growth rate at Constant Currency in the fiscal year
2020. Operating income excluding special items in 2020 was
€2.5 BN, an increase by 8% at Constant Currency on an
adjusted prior year basis. This lies in the upper end of our out-
look and we therefore met our expectations.

We also expected Delivered Operating Income to develop at a
mid to high single digit growth rate at Constant Currency in
2020. Delivered Operating Income excluding special items in

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

2020 was €2.2 BN, an increase by 7 % at Constant Currency on
an adjusted prior year basis. This is in line with our expecta-
tions, therefore we met our outlook as well.

At the beginning of the year, we set a target range for net
income development at a mid to high single digit growth rate at
Constant Currency. Net income excluding special items in 2020
increased to €1.4 BN. This increase at Constant Currency by
12 % on an adjusted prior year basis slightly exceeded our
expectations.

Basic earnings per share excluding special items increased at
Constant Currency by 15% on an adjusted prior year basis.
This increase is in line with the development of net income
excluding special items and shares outstanding, as we expected.

We earmarked €1.1 BN to €1.3 BN for capital expenditures in
2020. With an outlay of €1.0 BN, we have not met outlook due
to postponement of capital expenditures. We expected to spend
around €0.5 BN to €0.7 BN on acquisitions and investments.
We made acquisitions and investments (excluding investments
in debt securities) for €0.3 BN, this is slightly below of our
expectations due to postponement of acquisitions and invest-
ments. For further information on capital expenditures, acquisi-
tions, and investments see section “Results of operation, finan-
cial position and net assets” starting on PAGE 45.

Driven by earnings development, but primarily due to U.S. fed-
eral relief funding and advanced payments under the CARES
Act and other COVID-19 relief, including lower tax payments in
the North America Segment net cash provided by (used in)
operating activities in percent of revenue was high at 24 %,
exceeding our expectation of greater than 12.5 %.

Free cash flow accounted for 18 % of revenue in 2020, which
also exceeded our expectation for the same reasons of greater
than 5 %.

According to our forecast the net leverage ratio should have
been below 3.5 at the end of 2020. The net leverage ratio was
2.7 at the balance sheet date and is therefore as expected.

ROIC was at 5.8 %. Driven by the Impairment Loss this mea-
sure is lower than our expectation of at least 6.0 %.

A dividend per share of €1.34 planned to propose to be approved
by the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2021 is within our
expectation (in line with the development of net income and
shares outstanding).

The number of our employees (full-time equivalents) increased
from 120,659 at the end of 2019 to 125,364 at the end of 2020.
The number of employees therefore met our expectations of
more than 124,000 full-time equivalents.

Research and development expenditures aimed at boosting our
ability to adapt to future requirements amounted to €194 M,
this is below our adjusted expected range of €200 to €220M
due to lower than expected project costs and postponement of
project costs. The initial outlook for research and development
expenses for 2020 of €210 to €230 M was adjusted during the
third quarter to €200 to €220 M. Our research and develop-
ment activities are focused on developing innovative products
and renal therapies.

Consolidated financial statements

An overwiew of the key indicators for the consolidated financial
statements, SEE TABLE 2.28 ON PAGE 47.

Health care services revenue increased by 2 % compared to
the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to a 3 % nega-
tive impact from foreign currency translation, health care ser-
vices revenue increased by 5% driven by organic growth
(+3 %) despite lower reimbursement for calcimimetics, the
absence in 2020 of a revenue recognition adjustment for
accounts receivable in legal dispute previously recorded in
the prior year (+2 %) (SEE NOTE 22 of the notes to the consol-
idated financial statements) and contributions from acquisi-
tions (+1%), partially offset by the effect of closed or sold
clinics (-1%).

Dialysis treatments increased by 3% as a result of Same
Market Treatment Growth and contributions from acquisitions,
partially offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics.

At December 31, 2020, we owned, operated or managed
4,092 dialysis clinics compared to 3,994 dialysis clinics at
December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020,
we acquired 60 dialysis clinics, opened 106 dialysis clinics and

46

combined or closed 68 clinics. The number of patients treated
in dialysis clinics that we own, operate or manage increased
slightly to 346,553 at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019:
345,096), though this slight increase was impacted by the
excess mortality rates among patients due to COVID-19 (COVID-
19 Related Excess Mortality Rates) in certain of our operating
segments which are further described in the discussions below.

Health care product revenue increased by 4 %. Including a3 %
negative impact from foreign currency translation, health care
product revenue increased by 7 %. Dialysis product revenue
increased by 3 %. In addition to a 4% negative impact from
foreign currency translation, dialysis product revenue increased
by 7 % driven by higher sales of products for acute care treat-
ments, in-center disposables, renal pharmaceuticals, home
hemodialysis products and peritoneal dialysis products, par-
tially offset by lower sales of machines for chronic treatment.
Non-dialysis product revenue increased by 34 % to €101 M from
€76 M, with virtually no impact from foreign currency transla-
tion. The increase in non-dialysis product revenue was due to
higher sales of acute cardiopulmonary products.

The increase period over period in the gross profit margin of
31.0 % (2019: 30.9 %) was 0.1 percentage points. Foreign cur-
rency translation effects represented a 0.2 percentage point
increase in the current period. The resulting slight decrease at
Constant Exchange Rates was primarily driven by various
smaller impacts on the margin including higher personnel
expense and an unfavorable impact from pharmacy services in
the North America Segment, impacts from COVID-19 on costs,
unfavorable foreign currency transaction effects in the EMEA
Segment and the Asia-Pacific Segment, higher personnel
expense in certain countries in the EMEA Segment, an unfavor-
able impact from inflation (including hyperinflation in Argen-
tina) and higher treatment costs in the Latin America Segment
as well as start-up costs for dialysis clinics in the Asia-Pacific
Segment. These various impacts were mostly offset by the

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

absence in 2020 of a revenue recognition adjustment for
accounts receivable in legal dispute previously recorded in the
prior year and lower costs for renal pharmaceuticals.

The increase period over period in selling, general and adminis-
trative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of revenue of 17.7 %
(2019: 17.5%) was 0.2 percentage points. Foreign currency
translation effects represented a 0.1 percentage point increase
in the current period. The increase was primarily driven by the
Impairment Loss in the Latin America Segment (SEE NOTE 2 A
of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). The
increase was also impacted by the prior year remeasurement
effect on the fair value of investments (North America Seg-
ment) and the reduction of a contingent consideration liability
related to Xenios AG (“Xenios") in 2019 (EMEA Segment) as
well as higher costs related to the compliance monitor engaged
in accordance with the DOJ and SEC non-prosecution agree-
ment (SEE NOTE 22 of the notes the consolidated financial
statements) (Corporate). The increases were partially offset by
the prior year impacts from (a) costs associated with the sus-
tained improvement of our cost base (Costs Optimization Costs)
and (b) a revenue recognition adjustment for accounts receiv-
able in legal dispute in 2019, current year impacts from COVID-
19-related meeting and travel savings in the North America
Segment and various, smaller effects across our segments.

Research and development expenses increased by 15% to
€194 M from €168 M. The period over period increase as a per-
centage of revenue, was 0.1 percentage points, largely driven
by in-center and critical care program development as well as
activities in the fields of digital connectivity and regenerative
medicine and research and development activities at NxStage,
partially offset by increased capitalization of research and
development expenses in 2020.

Income from equity method investees increased by 28 % to
€95 M from €74 M. The increase was primarily driven by higher

income from Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd.,
an entity in which we have ownership of 45 %, mainly due to
higher sales of renal pharmaceuticals, income from the sale of
a license for certain renal pharmaceuticals and lower operating
expenses, partially offset by the impairment of a license held
based on an unfavorable clinical trial.

The decrease period over period in the operating income mar-
gin was 0.1 percentage points. Foreign currency translation
effects represented a 0.1 percentage point increase in the cur-
rent period. The decrease was largely driven by the increase in

SG&A expenses, partially offset by the increase in the gross
profit margin, as discussed above.

Delivered Operating Income remained relatively stable as com-
pared to the prior year. In addition to a 2 % negative impact
from foreign currency translation, Delivered Operating Income
increased by 2 % largely driven by increased operating income,
partially offset by an increase in income attributable to non-
controlling interests.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

4 a Qp

Net interest expense decreased by 14% to €368M from
€429 M. In addition to a 2 % positive impact from foreign cur-
rency translation, net interest expense decreased by 12 % pri-
marily due to lower interest rates driven by the replacement of
high interest-bearing bonds by debt instruments at lower inter-
est rates, lower variable Libor-based interest rates and lower
interest rates on lease liabilities.

Income tax expense increased by 25 % to €501 M from €402 M.
The effective tax rate increased to 25.9 % from 21.8 % for the
same period of 2019 largely driven by the non-deductible
Impairment Loss (SEE NOTE 2 A of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements) and the prior year tax benefit related to
the divestiture of Sound.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased
by 14 % to €271 M from €239 M. In addition to a 2 % positive
impact from foreign currency translation, net income attribut-
able to noncontrolling interests increased by 16 % due to
higher earnings in entities in which we have less than 100 %
ownership.

Net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA
decreased by 3 % to €1,164 M from €1,200 M. In addition to a
2% negative impact from foreign currency translation, net
income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA
decreased by 1% driven by the combined effects of the items
discussed above. COVID-19 resulted in a negative impact to net
income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA in
the amount of €49 M for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Basic earnings per share remained relatively stable as com-
pared to the prior year. In addition to a 2 % negative impact
from foreign currency translation, basic earnings per share
increased by 2 % primarily due to a decrease in the average
weighted number of shares outstanding for the period. The
average weighted number of shares outstanding for the period

decreased to approximately 294.1M in 2020 (2019: 302.7 M),
primarily as a result of our share buy-back program which was
concluded on April 1, 2020 (SEE NOTE 17 of the notes to the con-
solidated financial statements).

We employed 125,364 people (full-time equivalents) as of
December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: 120,659). This 4 %
increase was primarily due to organic business growth and
acquisitions, both of which were impacted by COVID-19 related
personnel requirements.

Segment reporting

The following discussions pertain to the North America Seg-
ment, the EMEA Segment, the Asia-Pacific Segment and the
Latin America Segment and the measures we use to manage
these segments.

North America Segment

Information about key indicators for the North America Seg-
ment can be found in TABLE 2.29.

Dialysis

Revenue

Dialysis revenue increased by 1%, including a 3 % negative
impact resulting from foreign currency translation. At Constant
Exchange Rates, dialysis revenue increased by 4 %. Dialysis
revenue is comprised of dialysis care revenue and health care
product revenue.

Dialysis care revenue increased by 1% to €10,057M from
€9,973 M. In addition to a 2 % negative impact from foreign
currency translation, dialysis care revenue increased by 3 %
mainly due to the absence in 2020 of a revenue recognition
adjustment for accounts receivable in legal dispute previously

recorded in the prior year (+2 %) (SEE NOTE 22 of the notes to
the consolidated financial statements) and contributions from
acquisitions (+1 %).

Dialysis treatments increased by 2 % largely due to Same Mar-
ket Treatment Growth. At December 31, 2020, 210,260 patients
(December 31, 2019: 211,064) were treated in the 2,639 dialysis
clinics (December 31, 2019: 2,579) that we own or operate in the
North America Segment. The decrease in patients was driven
by COVID-19 Related Excess Mortality Rates.

Health care product revenue increased by 7 %. In addition to a
3 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, health
care product revenue increased by 10 % driven by higher sales
of products for acute care treatments, renal pharmaceuticals,
in-center disposables and peritoneal dialysis products, partially
offset by lower sales of machines for chronic treatment and
home hemodialysis products.

Operating income margin

The increase period over period in the dialysis operating
income margin was 2.1 percentage points, with virtually no
impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was
driven by a favorable impact related to the absence in 2020 of
a revenue recognition adjustment for accounts receivable in
legal dispute previously recorded in the prior year, Cost Optimi-
zation Costs in the prior year, a higher reimbursement rate and
lower costs for renal pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the
remeasurement effect on the fair value of investments in the
prior year and higher personnel expense.

Delivered Operating Income

Dialysis Delivered Operating Income increased by 16 %. In addi-
tion to a 2 % negative impact from foreign currency transla-
tion, Delivered Operating Income increased by 18 % mainly as a
result of increased operating income, partially offset by an
increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Care Coordination

Revenue

Care Coordination revenue increased by 10 %. In addition to a
3% negative impact from foreign currency translation, Care
Coordination revenue increased by 13 % largely driven by an
increase in organic growth impacted by the prior year effect of
a reduction in patient attribution and a decreasing savings rate
for ESCOs (Prior Year ESCO Effect) (+17 %), partially offset by
the effect of closed or sold centers (-4 %).

Operating income margin

The increase period over period in the Care Coordination oper-
ating income margin was 4.2 percentage points, with virtually
no impact from foreign currency translation in the current
period. The increase was mainly due to the Prior Year ESCO
Effect, a favorable impact from vascular access services driven
by lower operating costs and higher volumes of procedures as
well as a favorable impact of the divestiture from loss-making
urgent care services, partially offset by an unfavorable impact
from pharmacy services.

Delivered Operating Income

Care Coordination Delivered Operating Income increased by
130 %. In addition to a 4 % negative impact from foreign cur-
rency translation, Delivered Operating Income increased by
134 % mainly as a result of increased operating income, par-
tially offset by an increase in income attributable to noncon-
trolling interests.

negative impact resulting from foreign currency translation,
health care service revenue increased by 4% largely as a
result of an increase in organic growth (+3 %) and contribu-
tions from acquisitions (+2 %), partially offset by the effect of

Dialysis treatments increased by 1% mainly due to Same Mar-
ket Treatment Growth and contributions from acquisitions, par-
tially offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics. As of Decem-
ber 31, 2020, 66,008 patients (December 31, 2019: 66,217) were
treated at the 804 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2019: 781) that
we own, operate or manage in the EMEA Segment. The
decrease in patients was driven by COVID-19 Related Excess
Mortality Rates.

Health care product revenue increased by 4 %. Including a3 %
negative impact from foreign currency translation, health care
product revenue increased by 7 %. Dialysis product revenue
increased by 3 %. Including a3 % negative impact from foreign
currency translation, dialysis product revenue increased by
6 % due to higher sales of products for acute care treatments
and home hemodialysis products, partially offset by lower sales
of machines for chronic treatment. Non-Dialysis product reve-
nue increased by 24 % to €95 M from €76 M. Including a1%
negative impact from foreign currency translation, non-dialysis
product revenue increased by 25 % largely due to higher sales
of acute cardiopulmonary products.

Operating income margin

The decrease period over period in the operating income
margin was 1.7 percentage points. Foreign currency translation
effects represented a 0.1 percentage point increase in the
operating income margin. The decrease was mainly due to the
reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to
Xenios in the prior year period, unfavorable foreign currency

22 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion, health care product revenue increased by 17 % due to
higher sales of in-center disposables, products for acute care

Operating income margin

The decrease period over period in the operating income mar-
gin was 28.9 percentage points. Foreign currency translation
effects represented a 5.1 percentage point decrease in the
operating income margin in the current period. The decrease
was mainly impacted by the Impairment Loss (SEE NOTE 2 A of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements).

Delivered Operating Income

Delivered Operating Income decreased to a loss of €157 M for
the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a Delivered
Operating Income of €42 M in the comparative period of 2019
due to the Impairment Loss noted above.

Financial position

Our investment and financing strategy did not change substan-
tially in the past fiscal year as our business model, which is based
on stable and high cash flows, allows for a reasonable proportion
of debt. We regard our refinancing options as being very stable
and flexible. During the past fiscal year, the focus of our investing
activities was on our health care services business.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

Financial management policies and goals

Besides optimizing our financial costs, our financing strategy
gives top priority to ensuring financial flexibility. We remain
flexible by being highly diversified with regard to tenors, inves-
tors and banks. Our financing profile is characterized by a wide
range of maturities up to 2031.

Our main mid- and long-term financing instruments are bonds
in euro and U.S. dollar as well as the Amended 2012 Credit
Agreement (a syndicated credit agreement with revolving
credit facilities and long-term loans in U.S. dollar and euro).
Short-term financing needs are covered by issuances under
our commercial paper program in euro, the Accounts Receiv-
able Facility in U.S. dollar and bilateral credit facilities.

In our long-term financial planning, we focus primarily on the
net leverage ratio, a non-IFRS measure. At December 31, 2020,
the net leverage ratio was 2.7 (2019: 3.2). See “Performance
management system” - "Net leverage ratio (Non-IFRS Mea-
sure)" starting on PAGE 26.

The key financial risks we are exposed to include foreign
exchange risk and interest rate risk. To manage these risks, we
enter into various hedging transactions that have been autho-
rized by the Management Board with banks which generally
have ratings in the “A” category or better. We do not use finan-
cial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes (for
financial risks, see section “Other risks” in chapter “Risks and
opportunities report” starting on PAGE 71 as well as NOTE 23 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements).

Fresenius SE, under a service agreement, conducts financial
instrument activities for us under the control of a single
centralized department. We have established guidelines for risk
management procedures and controls which govern the use of
financial instruments. These guidelines include a clear segrega-

tion of duties with regards to execution on the one hand and
administration, accounting and controlling on the other.

We also utilize Fresenius SE's cash management system as well
as an unsecured loan agreement with Fresenius SE (SEE NOTE 13
of the notes to the consolidated financial statements).

Rating

We are rated investment grade by the three leading rating
agencies, Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch (SEE TABLE 2.33).

* A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities of the Company, and may be
subject to suspension, change or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

Effect of off-balance-sheet financing
instruments on our financial position,
assets and liabilities

We are not involved in off-balance-sheet transactions that have
or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash
requirements or capital resources.

Sources of liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are typically cash provided by

operating activities, cash provided by short-term debt, pro-
ceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and divestitures. We

53

require this capital primarily to finance working capital needs,
fund acquisitions, operate clinics, develop free-standing renal
dialysis clinics and other health care facilities, purchase equip-
ment for existing or new renal dialysis clinics and production
sites, repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase shares, (see
“Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities” starting on
PAGE 54 and “Net cash provided by (used in) financing activi-
ties” starting on PAGE 55).

At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of
€1,082 M (December 31, 2019: €1,008 M).

As of December 31, 2020, our available borrowing capacity
resulting from unutilized credit facilities amounted to approxi-
mately €2.4 billion. The Amended 2012 Credit Agreement
accounted for approximately €1.3 billion in unutilized available
borrowing capacity.

Free cash flow (net cash provided by (used in) operating activi-
ties, after capital expenditures, before acquisitions and invest-
ments) in 2020 amounted to €3,197 M (2019: €1,454 M). Free
cash flow is a Non-IFRS Measure and is reconciled to net cash
provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly
comparable IFRS measure in section “Performance manage-
ment system” starting on PAGE 24. Free cash flow accounted for
17.9 % of revenue in 2020 (2019: 8.3 %).

Net cash provided by (used in)
operating activities

During 2020 we generated net cash provided by operating
activities of €4,233 M (2019: €2,567 M). Net cash provided by
operating activities accounted for 24% of revenue in 2020
(2019: 15 %). Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
is impacted by the profitability of our business, the develop-
ment of our working capital, principally inventories, receivables
and cash outflows that occur due to a number of specific items

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

as discussed below. The increase in net cash provided by oper-
ating activities in 2020 was largely driven by U.S. federal relief
funding and advanced payments under the CARES Act and
other COVID-19 relief (SEE NOTE 4 | of the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements), including lower tax payments in
the North America Segment, partially offset by an increase in
inventory levels related to a higher demand for specific prod-
ucts and higher safety inventory levels due to COVID-19.

The profitability of our business depends significantly on reim-
bursement rates for our services. Approximately 79 % of our
revenue is generated by providing health care services, a major
portion of which is reimbursed by either public health care
organizations or private insurers. In 2020, approximately 32 %
of our consolidated revenue was attributable to reimburse-
ments from U.S. federal health care benefit programs, such as
Medicare and Medicaid. Legislative changes could affect Medi-
care reimbursement rates for a significant portion of the ser-
vices we provide, as well as the scope of Medicare coverage. A
decrease in reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations and thus on our capacity to
generate cash flow.

In recent years, the stability of reimbursement in the U.S. has
been affected by (i) the implementation of the ESRD PPS in
January 2011, (ii) across-the-board spending cuts in payments
to Medicare providers by the U.S. federal government, com-
monly referred to as “U.S. Sequestration”, (iii) the phased
reduction to the ESRD PPS rate to account for the decline in
utilization of certain drugs and biologicals associated with dial-
ysis pursuant to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 as
subsequently modified under the Protecting Access to Medi-
care Act of 2014 and (iv) CMS's 2017 final rule on the Physician
Fee Schedule, which partially corrected reimbursement for
certain procedures that were materially undervalued in 2016.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT
General information
Overview of the Group
Economic Report
Subsequent events

Outlook
Risks and Opportunities Report
Corporate Governance fundamentals

We intend to continue to address our current cash and financ-
ing requirements using net cash provided by operating activi-
ties, our existing and future credit agreements, issuances
under our commercial paper program (SEE NOTE 13 of the notes
to the consolidated financial statements) as well as from the
use of our Accounts Receivable Facility. In addition, to finance
acquisitions or meet other needs, we expect to successfully
complete long-term financing arrangements, such as the issu-
ance of bonds.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities depends on
the collection of accounts receivable. Commercial customers
and government institutions generally have different payment
cycles. Lengthening their payment cycles could have a material
adverse effect on our capacity to generate cash flow. In addi-
tion, we could face difficulties enforcing and collecting accounts
receivable under the legal systems of and due to the economic
conditions in some countries. Accounts receivable balances,
net of expected credit losses, represented Days Sales Out-
standing (DSO) of average 50 days at December 31, 2020, a
decrease as compared to 73 days at December 31, 2019.

DSO by segment is calculated by dividing the respective seg-
ment’s accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties
and contract liabilities, converted to euro using the average
exchange rate for the period presented, less any sales or value
added tax included in the receivables, by the average daily
sales for the last twelve months of that segment, converted to
euro using the average exchange rate for the period. Receiv-
ables and revenues are adjusted for amounts related to acqui-
sitions and divestitures made within the reporting period with
a purchase price above a €50M threshold as defined in the
Amended 2012 Credit Agreement.

The development of DSO by reporting segment is shown in

The majority of our capital expenditures were used for main-
taining existing clinics, equipping new clinics, maintaining and
expanding production facilities, capitalization of machines pro-
vided to our customers and for Care Coordination as well as
capitalization of certain development costs. Capital expendi-
tures accounted for approximately 6 % of total revenue in
2020 (2019: 6 %).

Acquisitions during 2019 were primarily driven by the acquisi-
tion of NxStage on February 21, 2019 (SEE NOTE 3 of the notes to
the consolidated financial statements) as well as dialysis clinics.

In 2020, we received €57 M from divestitures. These divesti-
tures were mainly related to the divestment of debt securities
and certain research & development investments.

In 2019, we received €60 M from divestitures. These divesti-
tures were mainly related to the divestment of MedSpring
Urgent Care Centers in Texas, sales of debt securities, the
divestment of a California-based cardiovascular business and
B.Braun Medical Inc.'s purchase of NxStage’s bloodlines busi-
ness in connection with our acquisition of NxStage.

In 2021 we anticipate capital expenditures of €0.9 to €1.1 BN and
expect to make acquisitions and investments, excluding invest-
ments in debt securities, of approximately €0.5 to €0.7 BN.

Net cash provided by (used in)
financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities was €2,664 M in 2020
(2019: €467 M).

In 2020, cash was mainly used in the repayment of short-term
debt (including repayments under our commercial paper pro-
gram and short-term debt from related parties) and long-term
debt (including the repayment of Convertible Bonds at matu-

2020), the repayment of lease liabilities (including lease liabili-

the issuance of bonds in an aggregate principal amount of
$1,000 M on September 16, 2020) and short-term debt (includ-
ing short-term debt from related parties).

In 2019, cash was mainly used in the repayments of long-term
debt (including the current portion of long-term debt primarily
driven by the repayment of bonds due in July 2019), repay-
ments of short-term debt (including short-term debt from
related parties), repayment of lease liabilities (including lease

from long-term debt (including the issuance of bonds with a

under the revolving credit facilities of the Amended 2012 Credit
Agreement), proceeds from short-term debt (including short-
term debt from related parties) and the utilization of the
Accounts Receivable Facility.

On September 1, 2020, we paid a dividend of €1.20 per share for
2019 (€1.17 per share for 2018 paid in 2019). The total dividend
payment was €351 M in 2020 (2019: €355 M).

2012 Credit Agreement and Accounts Receivable Facility, we
are obligated to not exceed a maximum consolidated net lever-
age ratio as defined in these financing agreements.

As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all cove-
nants under the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement and our
other financing agreements. For information regarding our
Amended 2012 Credit Agreement, bonds and the Accounts
Receivable Facility, SEE NOTE 14 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements.

Although current and future economic conditions could
adversely affect our business and our profitability, we believe
that we are well positioned to continue to grow our business
while meeting our financial obligations as they come due. Due
to the non-discretionary nature of the health care services we
provide, the need for health care products utilized to provide
such services and the availability of government reimburse-
ment for a substantial portion of our health care services, our
business is generally not cyclical. A substantial portion of our
accounts receivable is generated by governmental payors.
While payment and collection practices vary significantly
between countries and even between agencies within one
country, government payors usually represent low to moderate
credit risk. However, limited or expensive access to capital
could make it more difficult for our customers to do business
with us, or to do business generally, which could adversely
affect our business by causing our customers to reduce or
delay their purchases of our health care products (see “Results
of operations” above). If the conditions in the capital markets
worsen, this could increase our financing costs and limit our
financial flexibility.

At our Annual General Meeting scheduled to be held on May 20,
2021, our General Partner and our Supervisory Board will pro-
pose to the shareholders a dividend of €1.34 per share for
2020, payable in 2021 (for 2019 paid in 2020: €1.20). The total

57

expected dividend payment is approximately €392 M compared
to dividends of €351 M for 2019 paid in 2020.

Our principal financing needs in 2021 relate to repayments of
bonds due in February 2021, which were already pre-financed
by the bonds issuance in September 2020, as well as amortiza-
tions under our Amended 2012 Credit Agreement. The dividend
payment in May 2021, anticipated capital expenditures, and
further acquisition payments are expected to be covered by
our cash flow, using existing credit facilities and, if required,
additional debt financing. We currently have sufficient flexibil-
ity under our debt covenants to meet our financing needs in
the near future. Generally, we believe that we will have suffi-
cient financing to achieve our goals in the future and to con-
tinue to promote our growth.

Net assets

Our total consolidated assets in the past fiscal year were
€31,689 M, a decrease of €1,246 M (4 %) over the prior year,
including a negative foreign exchange impact of 8 %.

Non-current assets decreased by €1,356 M (5 %) to €24,414 M
in 2020 and represented 77 % of total assets (2019: 78 %). This
decrease includes a negative foreign exchange impact of 7 %.
Moreover, non-current assets increased primarily as a result of
investments in property, plant and equipment and capitalized
development costs as well as an increase in rights of use under
leasing agreements, partially offset by a goodwill reduction due
to the Impairment Loss in the Latin America Segment.

Current assets increased by 2 % to €7,275 M. This was mainly
the result of increased cash and cash equivalents related to
U.S. federal relief funding and advance payments under the
CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief, as well as increased other
current assets mainly due to increased advance payments on
invoices. Furthermore, increased finished goods driven by

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

greater demand for specific products and higher safety inven-
tory levels, both as a result of COVID-19, contributed to that
increase. These were partially offset by a negative foreign
exchange impact of 10 % and a decrease in trade accounts and
other receivables from unrelated parties.

Total liabilities were €19,358M at December 31, 2020, a
decrease of €350 M (2 %), including a positive foreign exchange
impact of 6 %, from €19,708 M in 2019. This decrease was pri-
marily the result of the reduction in short-term debt and the
current portion of long-term liabilities. This was partially offset
by the increase in other non-current liabilities as well as cur-
rent provisions and other non-current liabilities, driven by
advance payments received under the Medicare and Medicaid
Accelerated and Advance Payment program (€852 M), which
were recorded as contract liability upon receipt and recognized
as revenue when the services are provided.

Current liabilities account for €1,088 M of our debt, a decrease
of €1,531M (58%), including a positive foreign exchange
impact of 3 %, from €2,619 M in the prior year. Furthermore,
the decrease of short-term debt from unrelated parties was
mainly a result of repayments under the commercial paper pro-
gram, the equity-neutral convertible bonds, the U.S. dollar-
denominated bonds and a euro-denominated term loan under
the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement. The decrease was par-
tially offset by the reclassification of U.S. dollar and Euro-de-
nominated bonds to the current portion of long-term debt, as
these will mature in 2021.

Long-term debt increased to €6,800 M from €6,458 M in the
prior year, an increase of €342 M (5 %), including a negative
foreign exchange impact of 4 %. Furthermore, the increase of
long-term debt was mainly a result of the issuance of bonds
with a total volume of €1,250 M and $1,000 M. It was partially
offset by the reclassification of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds
and euro-denominated bonds as well as the quarterly repay-

ments of the remaining term loans under the Amended 2012
Credit Agreement to the current portion of long-term debt, the
repayment of revolving loans under the 2012 credit agreement
and the reduction of the Accounts Receivable Facility.

Shareholders’ equity decreased by 7% to €12,331M. The
decrease was driven by a negative foreign exchange impact of
11%, purchases of treasury stock as part of a share buy-back
program, dividend payments and distributions to non-con-
trolling interests. It was partially offset by the consolidated
earnings and changes in fair value of equity and debt instru-
ments measured at fair value through other comprehensive
income. The equity to assets ratio decreased to 39 % at Decem-
ber 31, 2020 from 40 % at December 31, 2019, primarily as a
result of the decrease in Equity as well as the increase in long-
term debt as well as in current provisions and other current lia-
bilities related to U.S. federal relief funding and advance pay-
ments under the CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief. This was
partially offset by a decrease in short-term debt and the cur-
rent portion of long-term debt.

At Group level, ROIC decreased to 5.8 % at December 31, 2020
from 6.1% at December 31, 2019, driven by the Impairment
Loss in the Latin America Segment. Excluding the Impairment
Loss as well as excluding both the Impairment Loss and IFRS 16,
ROIC was 6,6 % and 7.5 %, respectively, at December 31, 2020
(see reconciliation in section “Performance management sys-
tem", “Return on invested capital” on PAGE 27). Goodwill,
included in the item invested capital, has a significant impact
on the calculation of the ROIC. The weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), including weighted risk premiums for country
risks, was 5.5 %.

our capital structure, SEE ALSO NOTE 18 of the notes to the con-
solidated financial statements.

Management's general assessment

In 2020 we achieved our revenue and net income targets
despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we are proposing
our 24th consecutive dividend increase.

While reported earnings in Q4 were negatively impacted by the
impairment in the Latin America Segment and accelerated
excess mortality due to COVID-19, we are on track regarding the
growth in home dialysis. In order to maintain safe operations
during the pandemic we have taken comprehensive measures
that have resulted in significantly increased costs in the Dialy-
sis Services business. Through governmental support, in par-
ticular in the U.S., accelerated efficiency measures and a strong
products business development, we managed to largely com-
pensate these costs.

At the time this Management Report was prepared, the Man-
agement Board continued to assess the results of operations,
financial position and net assets of Fresenius Medical Care as
positive, even though the effects of the increase in excess
mortality cannot be compensated. This will affect our earnings
development in 2021. To support its 2025 strategy, further
strengthen profitability and compensate for the negative earn-
ings effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Fresenius Medical Care
will launch its FME,, program. We confirm our 2025 targets that
are based on the Company ’s mid-term strategy.

BUSINESS POLICY

Fresenius Medical Care is the world’s leading provider of prod-
ucts and services for individuals with renal diseases based on
publicly reported revenue and the number of patients treated.
We aim to further expand this position in the years ahead. Our
products and health care services are at the core of our strat-
egy. To take it to the next level until 2025, we will concentrate on
three key areas: the renal care continuum, critical care solu-
tions, and complementary assets. Aspects of the renal care con-
tinuum include new renal care models, value-based care, chronic
kidney disease and transplantation, and future innovations.
Over the next few years, we will use our competence in the crit-
ical care business to address a variety of health challenges and
continue to leverage our core competencies through partner-
ships, investments, and acquisitions. This approach constitutes
our commitment to long-term sustainable development and
growth. We have no plans to make significant changes to our
business policy.

SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRON-
MENT - DIALYSIS MARKET

The Company expects the number of dialysis patients world-
wide to grow by about 3 % in 2021 depending on the further

59

development of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The accelerat-
ing effects of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic
are continuing into 2021. The further development significantly
depends on the adoption and speed of the roll out of vaccina-
tions to our worldwide patient population. Fresenius Medical
Care expects to have a significant adverse annualization effect
on treatment volumes. Some significant regional differences
are likely to remain: The Company anticipates below average
growth rates in the U.S., Japan and Western and Central Europe.
The number of patients with chronic kidney disease is already
relatively high in these countries and regions and patients gen-
erally have reliable access to treatment, normally dialysis. In
economically weaker regions we expect the growth rates partly
to be considerably higher. We expect patient numbers to con-
tinue growing in the coming years - SEE TABLE 2.39.

WORLDWIDE “3%

Source: Internal estimates.

Our growth strategy is based on an in-depth analysis of the
major trends affecting Fresenius Medical Care:

» Demographic factors: Demographic factors are one of the
main reasons for the continued growth of dialysis markets.
As average life expectancy rises worldwide, the share of
older people in the population is also growing. However, kid-
ney function deteriorates with age. Therefore, demographic
change is an important indicator for the future number of

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

dialysis patients, which is expected to increase from around
3.7 M worldwide in 2020 to over 6 M in 2030.

Increase in lifestyle diseases: Diseases such as high blood
pressure and diabetes are on the rise around the world. They
can cause damage to the entire organism and also often
impair kidney function in the long-term.

Improved access to medical care: Thanks to ongoing efforts to
establish and expand balanced and sustainable health care
systems in many countries around the globe, a growing num-
ber of patients are gaining access to suitable dialysis treat-
ments for the first time. We expect this trend to continue and
drive demand for high-quality products and treatments.
Changes in the health care industry: The health care industry
is constantly changing. We believe that demand for the holis-
tic care of chronic patients will continue to rise. In future, the
focus when treating kidney patients will no longer be simply
on offering individual dialysis products or services, but also
on combining all fields of application related to dialysis and
coordinating them more effectively.

Hemodialysis will remain the treatment of choice, accounting
for 88 % to 89 % of all dialysis therapies. Peritoneal dialysis
will continue to be the preferred treatment for 11 % to 12 % of
all dialysis patients.

The volume of the worldwide dialysis market, which amounted
to about €82 BN last year according to preliminary estimates,
is expected to increase by around 1% to 4 % per year. This is
based on the assumption that exchange rates will remain stable
in the forecasting period. The overall volume of the dialysis
market could thus reach around €83 BN to €85 by 2021.

In addition, the reimbursement and ancillary services utiliza-
tion environment significantly influences our business. In the
U.S., our biggest sales market, the reimbursements of govern-
mental institutions are lower than the reimbursements of pri-

FME..: TRANSFORMING GLOBAL
OPERATING MODEL TO
STRENGTHEN PROFITABILITY

To support its 2025 strategy, further strengthen profitability
and compensate for the negative earnings effects of the COVID-
19 pandemic, Fresenius Medical Care will launch its FME,,, pro-
gram. The program will focus on simplification of our operating
model. This shall include streamlining and transforming our
global operating model, applying learnings from the “new nor-
mal” and accelerating the digitalization agenda. Until 2025 we
plan to invest up to €500 M in our FME,, program to sustain-
ably reduce the cost base. We expect for each euro invested in
FME,,. to sustainably reduce the annual cost and minimally
improve operating income by the same amount by 2025.

MANAGEMENT'S GENERAL
ASSESSMENT

The excess mortality of dialysis patients due to the COVID-19
pandemic is expected to continue in 2021 and to have a signifi-
cant adverse effect on treatment volumes. This of course
affects the utilization of our clinics network. The further devel-
opment of the excess mortality rate strongly depends on the
increasing number of vaccines being approved, the adoption
and speed of the roll out of vaccinations to our worldwide
patient population. We also expect additional COVID-19 related
costs, in order to protect patients and employees and maintain
safe operations.

Our business development will be materially affected by COVID-
19 in 2021. To support its 2025 strategy, further strengthen
profitability and compensate for the negative earnings effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic, Fresenius Medical Care will launch
its FME,, program. We confirm the 2025 targets that are based
on the Companys mid-term strategy, and we are confident to
take our next step towards achieving our goal of providing
health care for chronically and critically ill patients across the
renal care continuum.

RISKS AND
OPPORTUNITIES
REPORT

As a company with global operations, we are
naturally exposed to risks associated with our
business activities. Ultimately, we can leverage
opportunities for our business only if we are
willing to take certain risks. Based on our many
years of experience and our extensive knowledge
of the markets, we are able to identify and assess
risks and opportunities for our business.

RISK AND OPPORTUNITY
MANAGEMENT

We see risk management as the ongoing task of determining,
analyzing and evaluating the spectrum of actual and potential
risks arising from our business operations in our environment
and, where possible, taking pre-emptive and corrective mea-
sures. Our risk management system provides us with a basis for
these activities. It enables management to identify risks that
could jeopardize our growth or going concern and to take steps
to minimize any negative impact. Accordingly, it is an important
component of our management and governance.

In addition, we ensure our long-term success by actively man-
aging opportunities. The aim here is to identify and assess
opportunities as early as possible, and initiate appropriate
measures so that opportunities can be turned into business
success for Fresenius Medical Care. Long-term and medi-
um-term opportunities are taken into account in our strategy
and budget planning. We exploit opportunities that can be

62

implemented at short notice as part of ongoing business
operations, provided this is meaningful and in line with our
business targets.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management system

The main objective of the risk management system is to iden-
tify potential risks as early as possible to assess their impact on
business activities and enable us, where necessary, to take
appropriate countermeasures. Due to constantly changing
external as well as internal requirements and conditions, our
risk management system is continuously evolving. In the past
financial year, the completeness and validity of risk information
within our risk management approach as well as its effective-
ness was strengthened by the introduction of a formal process
regarding the effectiveness review of countermeasures for cer-
tain risks as well as strengthening the interface between the
compliance management system and the enterprise risk man-
agement system.

The organizational structure of our risk management as well as
the previously described processes are shown in CHART 2.43 ON
PAGE 63.

The structure of the internal risk management system is based
on the internationally recognized framework for company-wide
risk management, the “Enterprise Risk Management - Inte-
grated Framework" of the Committee of Sponsoring Organiza-
tions of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Opportunities are
not covered by the implemented risk management system.

As part of the risk management system, regional risk coordina-
tors assume the task of coordinating risk management activi-
ties within the operating segments with the help of risk man-

agement software. These activities relate to existing and
potential emerging short-term as well as medium-term risks.
Semi-annually, identified risk information is processed by the
risk coordinators and discussed in regional/functional risk
committees. Subsequently, the central risk management func-
tion gathers the risks from regions and functions, analyses and
discusses them in the corporate risk committee and communi-
cates the compiled results to the Management Board. The
focus during this process is on significant risks, which are
above a defined threshold.

The Management Board and the central risk management are
promptly informed of new risks that are estimated to be high or
develop into high risks in order to ensure appropriate responses.
The effectiveness of the risk management system is monitored
by the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee of the
Supervisory Board.

In addition to risk reporting, standard reporting to manage-
ment is an important tool for managing and controlling risks, as
well as for taking preventive measures in a timely manner.
Therefore, our Management Board is informed on a monthly
basis about the industry situation, our operating and non-oper-
ating business, and the outcome of analyses of our earnings
and financial position, as well as of the assets position on a
quarterly basis.

The Global Internal Audit department is regularly informed
about the results of the risk management system. This depart-
ment determines risk focus areas and audits a selected number
of our departments, subsidiaries and IT applications worldwide
each year. Determined risk focus areas are audited across all
business segments. The department works according to the
internationally accepted standards of the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA), which was confirmed by a quality assessment in
2017. The scope of internal auditing is widespread and involves,
among other activities, periodic assessment of the effective-

ness of controls (including legal compliance controls) over busi-
ness processes, IT security, the reliability of financial reporting
and compliance with accounting regulations and internal poli-
cies. Our locations and units to be audited are determined
annually on the basis of a selection model taking various risks
into consideration. This annual audit plan is reviewed and
approved by the Management Board and the Audit and Corpo-
rate Governance Committee of the Supervisory Board. All audit
reports with material observations are presented to the Man-
agement Board. The Global Internal Audit department is also

63

responsible for monitoring the implementation of measures
mitigating identified deficiencies. The Management Board is
informed about the mitigation status on a quarterly basis. The
Audit and Corporate Governance Committee of the Super-
visory Board is also informed of the audit results. In 2020 the
Global Internal Audit department stopped onsite audits due to
COVID-19 from March onwards and conducted all audits remote.
A total of 40 audits were carried out. Risk focus areas were
compliance, acquisitions and cybersecurity.

Nevertheless, it is important to note that a functioning and
adequate risk management system cannot guarantee that all
risks are fully identified and controlled.

Internal control and risk management
system for the Group's accounting process

Our internal control system over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the Group financial state-
ments are issued in accordance with appropriate accounting
principles. Our internal reporting process is generally carried
out at four levels and is designed for the reliable recording, pro-
cessing and control of financial data and key figures. At each of
these four reporting levels - the local entity, the region, the seg-
ment and the entire Group - the figures and data are compared
regularly on a monthly and quarterly basis with the previous
year’s values, budget targets, and the latest projections. In
addition, the Management Board and the departments respon-
sible for preparing the annual and consolidated financial state-
ments discuss all parameters, assumptions and estimates that
substantially affect the externally reported consolidated and
segment results. The Audit and Corporate Governance Com-
mittee of the Supervisory Board also reviews current quarterly
results and compares them with budgets and projections.

The internal control system contains guidelines and instruc-
tions designed for the appropriate and accurate recording and
presentation of Company transactions.

Further control mechanisms aimed at achieving reliable finan-
cial reporting and correct recording of transactions within the
accounting and the consolidation process include automated
and manual reconciliations, as well as the separation of certain
personnel functions to prevent potential conflicts of interest.
All process owners identify and assess the risks of their respec-
tive processes in terms of the implications for accounting and
financial reporting. These process owners also determine that

corresponding controls are in place to minimize these risks.
Changes to accounting standards are discussed on an ongoing
basis and considered in the preparation of the financial state-
ments. Employees responsible for financial reporting are pro-
vided with regular training regarding changes in accounting
standards. The consolidation is performed centrally by the
department which is responsible for the group accounting. The
basis for the consolidation is derived from reporting packages
and sub-group consolidated financial statements prepared and
submitted by local group entities. The preparation of reporting
packages and sub-group consolidated financial statements is
performed according to central requirements and guidelines.

As we are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it is
required to adhere to the requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Ox-
ley Act (SOX). Section 404 of this federal law stipulates that
the management boards of companies listed in the U.S. are
responsible for implementing and adhering to an effective
internal control system to produce reliable financial reporting.
Based on this requirement, the design and operating effective-
ness of the internal control system over financial reporting are
routinely tested and considered in regular internal audits.
These criteria are also included in the review by our indepen-
dent registered public accounting firm.

The internal control system over financial reporting follows the
criteria of the COSO model, Internal Control - Integrated Frame-
work (2013), which was developed by the Committee of Spon-
soring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and is rec-
ognized as a standard by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). In accordance with the COSO model, the
internal control system over financial reporting is divided into
five components: control environment, risk assessment, con-
trol activities, information and communication, as well as the
monitoring of the internal control system. Each of these com-
ponents is regularly documented, tested and assessed. We

64

aligned our internal controls to fulfill the requirements of the
COSO model.

Our review of the internal control system over financial report-
ing complies with a specific SEC guideline (Guidance Regarding
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting) and is conducted with software support. Initially,
regional project teams coordinate the assessment of the inter-
nal control system in each region, after which the results are
consolidated for the whole Group. Based upon this assessment,
management evaluates the effectiveness of the internal con-
trol system for the current fiscal year. External advisers are
consulted as needed. A corporate steering committee meets
several times a year to review regulatory developments and
changes of relevant internal control requirements, to discuss
possible control deficiencies, and derive further measures. In
addition, in its meetings, the Audit and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Supervisory Board is informed regularly of
the results of management's assessment.

As of December 31, 2020, management assessed our internal
control system over financial reporting and determined that
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2020 is effective.

Internal control systems over financial reporting are subject
to inherent limitations, irrespective of how carefully these sys-
tems are designed. As a result, there is no absolute assurance
that financial reporting objectives can be met, nor that mis-
statements will always be prevented or detected.

Risks

The following section describes significant risks which could
have an impact on our business operations. In the course of the
risk assessment an estimation of the risks takes place regard-
ing the likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact in the

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

respective assessment period, allowing a prioritization of
the risks into the classifications “low” “medium” and “high”.
Besides quantitative factors, especially qualitative factors are
applied. For the identification of strategic developments,
besides the short-term consideration (one year), risks can also
be assessed in terms of a mid-term effect within the subse-
quent five years.

The scales for classification of potential impact and likelihood
as well as the localization of the risks within the risk matrix are
depicted in CHART 2.44 ON PAGE 65. The risk areas as well as
measures for mitigating the impact or the probability of occur-
rence of risks within these areas are described in the following
section.

Sector-specific risks
Regulatory environment, product quality

Our operations in both health care services business and prod-
ucts business are subject to extensive governmental regulation
in virtually every country in which we operate. We are also sub-
ject to other laws of general applicability, including anti-trust
laws. The applicable regulations, which differ from country to
country, cover areas that include:

> the quality, safety and efficacy of medical and pharmaceuti-
cal products and supplies;

> regulatory approvals and oversight of clinical and certain
non-clinical research and development activities;

> product approvals and regulatory approvals for new prod-
ucts or product improvements;

> the operation and licensure of manufacturing facilities, labo-
ratories, dialysis clinics, ambulatory surgery centers and
other health care facilities;

> audits and reviews by enforcement authorities, including the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for compliance with
applicable drug regulations;

> product labeling, advertising and other promotion;

> accurate reporting and billing for government and third-
party reimbursement including accurate and complete med-
ical records to support such billing;

>the discounting of reimbursed drug and medical device
products and the reporting of drug prices to government
authorities;

> limits on our ability to make acquisitions or certain invest-
ments and the terms of those transactions;

vacy of protected health information and other protected
data;

> compliance with due diligence, warranty obligations and
product liability rules and

> compensation of medical directors and other financial
arrangements with physicians and other referral sources.

In addition to the risks from non-compliance with the regula-
tory environment, as a manufacturing company we face the
risk that products, as a result of unsuitable product designs or
issues in the production process, do not fulfill our standards of
quality and could lead to the possibility of not achieving
expected treatment results which may result in product recalls
that might lead to significant adverse financial results or repu-
tational damage.

If we fail to comply with one or more of these laws or regula-
tions or incurs a quality incident, this may give rise to a number
of adverse legal and financial consequences. These include, in
particular, loss or suspension of governmental certifications,
loss or suspension of licenses under the laws of governmental
authority from which we generate substantial revenues, mone-
tary and administrative penalties, recall actions and claims for
damages, increased costs for compliance with government

orders, complete or partial exclusion from government reim-
bursement programs, refunds of payments received from gov-
ernment payors and government health care program benefi-
ciaries due to any failures to meet applicable requirements or
complete or partial curtailment of our authority to conduct
business. In the end, these types of risks could no longer be
insured. Including the considerable costs of legal defense, all
the consequences mentioned above could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and finan-
cial condition.

A number of the health care businesses in the U.S., that the
Company operates, is owned or managed by entities in which
one or more hospitals, physicians or physician practice groups
hold an interest. We also have arrangements with physician
practices to collaborate on our value-based arrangements
with public and private payors. While the Company has struc-
tured its arrangements with physicians to comply with many
of the criteria for safe harbor protection and waivers under
the federal and state Anti-Kickback Statutes, its arrange-
ments do not satisfy all elements of such safe harbor. If one or
more of our arrangements, including value-based agreements
were found to be in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute or
the Stark Law, we could be required to restructure or termi-
nate them. We also could be required to repay to Medicare,
Medicaid as well as other federal health care amounts pursu-
ant to any prohibited referrals, and we could be subject to
monetary penalties and exclusion from federal and state
health care programs. Imposition of any of these penalties
could have a material adverse impact on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Compliance programs implemented in the regions reduce the
risk of legal violations by providing general and specific rules of
conduct and procedures as well as regular training of the
employees according to the specifications. To ensure that our
products and services comply with the quality requirements,

66

we implemented quality management systems in the different
regions. The employees have access to procedures and work
instructions to ensure that the applicable quality requirements
are met. In addition, we conduct internal reviews of the produc-
tion sites and clinics to monitor compliance with quality stan-
dards of our products and services. Furthermore, our plants
and hospitals are also subject to external reviews by the rele-
vant supervisory authorities.

U.S. federal health care programs

As stated in the report in section “Macroeconomic and sec-
tor-specific environment” of chapter “Economic Report” start-
ing on PAGE 38, our dialysis clinics in the US participate in the
Quality Incentive Program (QIP) within the End-Stage Renal
Disease (ESRD) prospective payment system (PPS). Payment
reductions of up to 2 % of Medicare reimbursements based on
previous year’s performance can be made if the quality stan-
dards of the QIP are not met in the clinics. Should we fail to
meet the QIP’s minimum requirements to a greater extent, this
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Through our value-based agreements and risk products, we
assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for
certain patients in return for fixed periodic payments from gov-
ernmental and commercial insurers. We currently participate in
the “Comprehensive ESRD Care initiative” of the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as well as in remunera-
tion agreements with insurers under which we receive fixed
periodic payments to cover all, or a defined amount of treat-
ment costs, for a defined population of patients (Details and
detailed descriptions of the above mentioned and other pro-
grams in which we participate can be found in the report in sec-
tion “Macroeconomic and sector-specific environment" of
chapter “Economic Report” starting on PAGE 38).

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

Under CMS's Comprehensive ESRD Care Model, dialysis provid-
ers and physicians can form entities known as ESRD Seamless
Care Organizations (ESCOs). ESCOs that achieve the program's
minimum quality thresholds and generate reductions in CMS's
cost of care above certain thresholds for the ESRD patients
covered by the ESCO will receive a share of the cost savings.
However, ESCOs may also owe payments to CMS if actual costs
of care rise above set thresholds.

The profitability in our value-based agreements and risk prod-
ucts is dependent in part upon our ability to negotiate favor-
able financial terms, to manage a patient's care, to collabo-
rate with our payer partners, to coordinate with other health
care providers and to find cost efficient, medically appropri-
ate sites of service for our patients. Any failure to do so would
limit our ability to improve the quality of patient care and
health outcomes and to reduce medically unnecessary costs,
which could lead to poorer performance under value-based
payment arrangements.

The reserves that we establish in connection with the operation
of our value-based arrangements and risk products as well as
estimations of the amount of revenues from health care ser-
vices that we recognize in a reporting period are based upon
assumptions and judgments concerning a number of factors
which are subject to uncertainties. Those factors include trends
in health care costs, expenses, the complicated billing and col-
lection process, complex and changing laws and regulations
subject to interpretation, determination of primary and sec-
ondary coverage and other factors. Additionally, collections,
refunds and payor retractions may continue to occur for up to
three years or longer after services are provided. To the extent
the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated
based on our underlying assumptions, the timing and amount
of our recognition of revenues as well as future earnings could
be adversely affected or incurred losses could increase.

Although efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have
been unsuccessful, further efforts to repeal or revise the ACA,
including pending litigation seeking to declare the ACA as
unconstitutional, may affect the project's future prospects in
ways we currently cannot quantify or predict. We have applied,
and were accepted, for participation in CMS’ Comprehensive
Kidney Care Contracting (CKCC) model. While those entities
which were accepted have elected to participate in the imple-
mentation period beginning on October 15, 2020, each entity
will elect, prior to April 1, 2021, whether to continue its partici-
pation at-risk beginning the first performance year. We do not
yet know whether we and our partners will be able to deliver
better health outcomes while lowering CMS’ costs.

We cannot give any assurance that we will achieve the cost sav-
ings required or contemplated by these programs, which could
have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addi-
tion, we may experience higher write-offs of Medicare deduct-
ibles and other cost-sharing amounts due to secondary unin-
sured and underinsured patients, resulting in an increase in
uncollectible accounts.

We mitigated the impact of the ESRD PPS and the other legis-
lative initiatives referenced above with two broad measures.
First, we work with medical directors and treating physicians to
make clinical protocol changes used in treating patients consis-
tent with the QIP and good clinical practices, and we negotiate
pharmaceutical acquisition cost savings. In addition, we
achieved greater efficiencies and better patient outcomes by
introducing new initiatives to improve patient care upon initia-
tion of dialysis, increase the percentage of patients using home
therapies and achieve additional cost reductions in its clinics.

Composition of our customer base

Our health care product business and our dialysis services busi-
ness differ across the regions in which we operate. In many

67

cases, our products and services are paid, either directly or
indirectly, by government institutions. We believe the risk of
default from a government payor is generally low to moderate
worldwide. On a country level, the payor base is characterized
by distinct customer or payor groups which can range in vol-
ume from a few customers to a considerable amount of cus-
tomer types which have varying levels of risk associated with
default or non-payment of receivables as well as risks for
dependencies based upon the competition within low volume
customer base environments. In certain cases, a resulting
dependency on the payment behavior and decision-making of
our business partners can affect the collectability of accounts
receivable and can adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our measures aim to mitigate these risks by actively negotiat-
ing long-term contracts with major customers, targeted mar-
keting activities, developing new product and pricing models as
well as improving the quality of our services and products.

Reimbursement by private insurers

In the U.S. a portion of the dialysis treatments is reimbursed by
private insurers and integrated care organizations; these reim-
bursements are in general higher than the reimbursements of
the public health care systems. As a result, the payments we
receive from private payors contribute a substantial portion of
our profit. In 2020, approximately 36 % of our consolidated
Health Care revenues were attributable to private payors in the
North America Segment. If these payors succeed in lowering
reimbursement rates in the USA, change the extent or condi-
tions of their networks or if the portion of reimbursements by
private insurers in general drops, this could result in a signifi-
cant reduction in our revenue and operating profit. As of Janu-
ary 1, 2021, for the first time, all ESRD patients are eligible to
enroll in Medicare Advantage plans. As a result, some patients
with commercial coverage, may elect to move to Medicare

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

Advantage plans which generally pay less than other commer-
cial plans. In addition, the health care insurance industry is
experiencing continuing consolidation among insurers and
pharmacy benefit managers, including increasing buyer power
and impacts on referral streams. This may have an adverse
impact on our ability to negotiate favorable coverage terms
and commercially reasonable rates with such insurers.

We monitor the relationships with private health insurance
companies continuously and try to hedge the business through
long-term contracts to maintain profitability.

A portion of our patients who are currently covered by private
insurers may be unable to continue to pay the premiums and
may become uninsured for dialysis services or elect to transi-
tion to government funded reimbursement programs that
reimburse us at lower rates for our services if legislative or reg-
ulatory efforts to restrict or eliminate the charitable funding of
patient insurance premiums are successful.

Health care reforms

A number of governments have been considering proposals
to modify their current health care systems to improve quality
of and access to health care and to control costs. Policy-
makers in several countries are also considering reforms that
could change the methodology used to reimburse providers
of health care services. Furthermore, standards and regula-
tions compulsory for providing dialysis service can be subject
to extensive changes.

In fiscal year 2020, we derived approximately 32 % of our
worldwide revenue from Medicare and Medicaid reimburse-
ments in the U.S. Consequently, changes in legislation or reim-
bursement practices regarding e.g. the End-Stage Renal Dis-
ease Prospective Payment System (ESRD PPS), the Physician
Fee Schedule, the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, and the

Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System could influence
the volume of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for ser-
vices provided and the insurance coverage.

A decrease in reimbursement rates, covered services or
changes to standards, regulations or state funding in countries
in which the Group operates, especially significant changes in
the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs could reduce our rev-
enue and profitability and have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In this context it might happen that the annually adjusted ESRD
PPS rates may not provide fully compensating reimbursement
for the services or products consumed during service. This
especially refers to the reimbursement of pharmaceuticals
depending on their status as outside of or as part of the bun-
dled rate. Pharmaceuticals included within the bundled rate are
subjected to increased reimbursement pressure. If we are
unable to secure appropriate reimbursement arrangements for
the pharmaceuticals we provide in our dialysis clinics, we could
experience a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Further, an increased utilization of bundled pharmaceuticals or
decreases in reimbursement for pharmaceuticals outside the
bundled rate may result in a material adverse impact on our
results of operations.

In the U.S., the previous administration publicly announced its
intention to pursue significant changes to existing health care
insurance programs. Although that administration's efforts to
repeal or replace ACA were unsuccessful and the current U.S.
Administration has stated its intention to maintain and
strengthen the ACA, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argu-
ments in November 2020 regarding the constitutionality of the
ACA. In addition, options to restructure the Medicare program
in the direction of a defined-contribution, “premium support”
model and to shift Medicaid funding to a block grant or per cap-

68

ita arrangement, with greater flexibility for the states, are also
being considered.

In October of 2017, the U.S. administration discontinued making
cost-sharing reduction (CSR) reimbursements to insurers, argu-
ing that Congress had failed to appropriate funding for them. In
response, many state departments of Insurance (DOls) either
allowed or required insurers to mitigate their losses by increas-
ing the 2018 premiums on their ACA plans. Many insurers also
mitigated the impact to themselves by “silver loading”, a prac-
tice whereby the premiums for silver-level plans were increased
to offset the loss of CSR payments. Silver loading may also have
mitigated the impact of premium increases to some low-income
consumers by increasing their premium tax credits. In 2019 and
2020, all states either permitted or required silver loading. In
2017, several insurers sued the U.S. federal government to rein-
state CSR payments. While the Biden administration is expected
to reinstate CSR reimbursements and to limit states’ access to
waivers allowing silver loading, we cannot predict, the extent to
which silver loading will continue or how the ongoing litigation
over the U.S. federal government's obligation to pay the CSRs
might be resolved. As a result, a reduction in the availability of
insurance through such exchanges could reduce the number of
our commercially insured patients and shift such patients to
Medicare and Medicaid.

Challenges of this nature could have significant effects on our
businesses, both positive and negative, but the outcomes are
impossible to predict.

Risks relating to the Company's business
Growth
The health care industry experiences continuing consolidation

particularly among health care providers. This development
could adversely affect our ability to find suitable acquisition

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

targets and to increase future growth and product sales. Addi-
tionally, our ability to make future acquisitions as well as to
develop our core dialysis and non-core business depends, in
part, on the appropriate strategic target selection, the avail-
ability of financial resources and the current restrictions
imposed by competition laws as well as existing credit agree-
ments. The integration of acquired businesses may cause prob-
lems, e.g. by assuming unknown liabilities, underperformance
subsequent to integration, associated requirements from com-
petition authorities or non-compliant business practices not
disclosed by the seller or not uncovered during due diligence.
We also compete with other health care companies in seeking
suitable acquisition targets and developing our core dialysis
and non-core business. Any or all of these factors generally
could have a material adverse effect on our future growth,
including growth of our product sales.

Competitors

We face numerous competitors in both our health care services
business and dialysis products business, some of which may
possess substantial financial, marketing or research and devel-
opment resources. Competition from new and existing compet-
itors and especially new competitive developments and innova-
tions in technology and care delivery models could materially
adversely affect the future pricing and sale of our products and
services. In particular, technological innovation has historically
been a significant competitive factor in the dialysis products
business. The introduction of new products or services by com-
petitors could render one or more of our products or services
less competitive or even obsolete, which could also affect our
sales and distribution of pharmaceuticals for which, to some
extent, we are obligated to make certain minimum annual roy-
alty payments.

To ensure our permanent competitiveness, we work closely
together with physicians and scientists. Important technologi-

cal and pharmaceutical innovations are intended to be quickly
identified and further developed, if necessary also by adapting
our business strategy. Moreover, we secure our competitive-
ness by ongoing analyzes of our market environment as well as
the regulatory framework. The market activity, especially our
competitors’ products and newly launched dialysis-related
products are thoroughly monitored. The cooperation between
the various technical, medical and academic institutions within
our company also ensures our competitiveness, which is finally
further enhanced by our consequent conduction of programs
devoted to cost saving and efficiency increase.

Research and development

The development of new products and therapies proposes a
risk that the desired development goal will not be achieved or
achieved significantly later than planned. Costly and extensive
preclinical and clinical examinations are necessary until admis-
sion. All products, packaging, applications and technologies are
constantly and systematically monitored, tested and improved.
We address potential risks in the area of research and develop-
ment (R&D) by continually analyzing, evaluating and assessing
whether the R&D projects fit into our overall strategy. As a ver-
tically integrated company, we also benefit from direct contact
with our patients and medical professionals. Due to this close
proximity to the market, we have the potential to gather import-
ant information to develop and offer products and therapies
that meet the needs of our customers.

Referral practices

In providing services within our health care business, we
depend upon patients choosing our health care facilities as the
location for their care. Patients may select a facility based, in
whole or in part, on the recommendation of their physician.
Physicians and other clinicians typically consider a number of
factors when recommending a particular dialysis facility, dialy-

69

sis home program, pharmacy, physician practice, vascular sur-
gery center or urgent care center to an ESRD patient, including,
the quality of care, the competency of staff, convenient sched-
uling, location and physical condition. Physicians may change
their recommendations, which may result in the movement of
new or existing patients to competing facilities, including facili-
ties established by the physicians themselves. At most of our
dialysis clinics and home programs, a relatively small number
of physicians often account for the referral of all or a signifi-
cant portion of the patient base. We have no ability to control
these recommendations and referrals. If a significant number
of physicians or other referral sources cease referring their
patients to our facilities and home programs or stop purchas-
ing or prescribing our dialysis products, this would reduce our
health care revenue and could materially adversely affect our
overall operations.

Intellectual property

One of the typical intellectual property risks faced by us is inad-
equate protection of sensitive knowledge in the form of patents
for technologies and products we developed This means that
competitors could copy our products without incurring compa-
rable development costs. Moreover, a loss of sensitive knowl-
edge could occur due to industrial spying or insufficient
employee-non-compete restrictions. In addition, we could
infringe the patent of a competitor and thus be liable for dam-
ages; this could result in a ban on us further selling the affected
product. An inadequate protection of our intellectual property
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and
results of operations.

Procurement
Our business is dependent on the reliable supply of several raw

materials and finished components for production and service
purposes. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

these materials at times of limited availability of such materi-
als, this could result in delays in production or loss of sales and
hence have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Sim-
ilarly, price increases by suppliers and the inability to access
new products or technology could also adversely affect our
results of operations. In certain necessary cases products are
obtained from a sole supplier. A failure of such a supplier could
adversely affect our ability to manufacture, distribute or sell
our products in a timely or cost-effective manner. Due to the
stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies
we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replace-
ment sources.

Our purchasing strategy is aimed at developing partnerships
with strategic suppliers through long-term contracts and at the
same time ensuring, where reasonably practicable, that we
have at least two sources for all supply and price-critical pri-
mary products (dual sourcing, multiple sourcing). To prevent
loss of suppliers, we monitor our supplier relationships on a
regular basis. Suppliers which are integral to our procurement
functions are also subject to performance and risk analyses as
well as continuous supply chain monitoring. Through constant
market analyses, a demands-based design of supplier-relation-
ships and -contracts, as well as the use of financial instruments,
we seek to mitigate disruptive goods shortages and potential
price increases and to provide access to new product and tech-
nology developments.

Personnel

Our continued growth in the health care business will depend
upon the ability to attract and retain skilled workforce, includ-
ing highly skilled nurses and other medical personnel. Competi-
tion for those employees is intense and shortages for these
sought-after employees, such as nurses, or skilled engineers
and research and development personnel, may increase our
and recruiting costs and/or impair our reputation for produc-

tion of technologically advanced products. Moreover, we con-
sider that future success in the provider business depends on
the ability to attract and retain qualified physicians to serve as
employees of or consultants to our health care services busi-
nesses. Our health care products business depends on the
development of new products, technologies and treatment
concepts to be competitive. Additionally, in recruiting, employ-
ing and retaining personnel we may be exposed to increasing
risks relating to various labor and staffing laws, legislative,
union or other labor-related activities or changes. Further,
these factors could impact the integration of acquired compa-
nies into our operations, which could increase our costs,
decrease our productivity and prevent us from realizing syner-
gies from acquisitions. If we are unable to manage the risks
mentioned, then our growth and results of operations could be
adversely impacted.

Corruption and fraud

We operate many facilities and engages with other business
associates to help it carry out its health care activities. In such
a decentralized system, it is difficult to maintain the desired
level of oversight and control over the thousands of persons
employed by many affiliated companies and its business asso-
ciates. Training, oversight and compliance programs cannot
ensure protection from deliberate, reckless or inadvertent acts
of employees or third-party intermediaries that violate our
compliance policies or anti-corruption laws. Such violations
could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse
effect on results of operations or financial condition.

Beginning in 2012, we received certain communications alleg-
ing conduct in countries outside the United States that might
violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other
anti-bribery laws. We conducted investigations with the assis-
tance of outside counsel and, in a continuing dialogue, advised
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the United

70

States Department of Justice (DOJ) about these investigations.
The DOJ and the SEC also conducted their own investigations,
in which we cooperated.

In the course of this dialogue, we identified and reported to the
DOJ and the SEC, and took remedial actions with respect to,
conduct that resulted in the DOJ and the SEC seeking mone-
tary penalties including disgorgement of profits and other rem-
edies. This conduct revolved principally around our products
business in countries outside the United States. On March 29,
2019, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the
DOJ and a separate agreement with the SEC intended to
resolve fully and finally the U.S. government allegations against
us arising from the investigations.

In 2015, we self-reported to the German prosecutor conduct
with a potential nexus to Germany and continued to cooperate
with government authorities in Germany in their review of the
conduct that prompted our and United States government
investigations.

Since 2012, we have made and continue to make further signif-
icant investments in our compliance and financial controls and
in our compliance, legal and financial organizations. Our reme-
dial actions included separation from those employees respon-
sible for the above-mentioned conduct. We are dealing with
post-FCPA review matters on various levels. We continue to be
fully committed to compliance with the FCPA and other appli-
cable anti-bribery laws.

Further information on these investigations can be found in
NOTE 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Information systems and business processes

As we continue to grow and introduce more international oper-
ations, our processes are increasingly complex. Accordingly, we

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

are more and more dependent on information and communica-
tion technologies and -systems to structure our processes and
harmonize them between different regions. An insufficient
design of those systems and business processes as well as
insufficient resources could lead to non-availability of certain
information, causing inefficient workflows, deficient internal
and external communication and intransparencies regarding
operations. A breakdown of these systems could temporarily
lead to standstill of parts of our provider and product business
and consequently cause heavy damages.

Additionally, cyber-attacks or privacy and data breaches
regarding both our internal systems as well as systems of third-
party service providers could result in the misappropriation or
compromise of sensitive information. We and our third-party
service providers gather and handle sensitive personal infor-
mation of our patients as well as financial data in many regions
of the world and thus need to adhere to various data protection
and privacy regulations. Increased reliance on, and utilization
of, telemedicine for delivery of healthcare services could
increase this risk. Any loss, impermissible use, access or disclo-
sure of this sensitive information or non-compliance with data
protection and privacy related laws, regulations and standards
could threat our position in competition, our reputation as well
as our ability to continue normal operations.

In May 2020, our IT systems were attacked which resulted in
certain patient data being illegally published in Serbia. We
immediately filed a complaint against the unknown attackers
with the public prosecutor in Germany and we have contacted
the patients who were affected by the illegal data publication
as well as other relevant regulatory agencies and stakeholders.
Furthermore, we intensified our efforts to implement response
measures, which include for example Network monitoring for
suspicious activity, endpoint threat protection and improve-
ments in the back-up and data loss recovery plans. There was

no material impact to the financial condition and results of
operations as a result of this attack.

Using its Information Security Management System (ISMS),
which is based on the internationally recognized security stan-
dard ISO 27002, our security guidelines and processes are
enhanced continuously. Business data is backed up regularly
and disaster recovery plans, which are regularly tested and
improved, are in place. We operate three data centers at
geo-graphically separate locations to maximize the availability
and data security of IT systems. A mirrored infrastructure that
creates a copy of critical systems is in use. In general, we con-
tinue to enhance our internal information and reporting sys-
tems to ensure that their structure meets evolving needs.

Furthermore, among others, company guidelines relating to
data protection and privacy, which also regulate the assign-
ment of access rights and third-party collaboration, must be
considered, trainings for employees are conducted and gover-
nance structures are continuously adapted. Compliance is
monitored with controls including those relating to Section 404
of SOX. Operational and security audits are carried out every
year both internally and by external auditors. The existing IT
security architecture with different layers of security measures
protects the systems in our data centers. The access to sensi-
tive or critical data from outside of the secured data center net-
works is protected by the usage of secure protocols and cryp-
tographic measures. Besides that, annual penetration tests for
applications with critical data (e.g. patient or personnel data)
are conducted.

Other risks
Liquidity and financing

The liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a company is poten-
tially unable to meet its financial obligations or to fund other

71

purposes. Our Management Board manages the liquidity of the
Group by means of effective working capital and cash manage-
ment as well as an anticipatory evaluation of refinancing alter-
natives. Our Management believes that existing credit facili-
ties, cash flow from operating activities and additional
short-term borrowings are sufficient to meet our foreseeable
demand for liquidity.

Furthermore, inadequate indebtedness could jeopardize the
successful execution of our business strategy, increase our vul-
nerability to general adverse economic conditions as well as
limit our ability to obtain necessary financing. At December 31,
2020 respectively December 31, 2019, the Group had financial
debt and lease liabilities of €12.38 BN respectively €13.78 BN.
Our credit agreements and notes include covenants that
require maintaining certain financial ratios or meeting other
financial tests. The covenants also restrict our ability to dispose
of assets, incur debt, pay dividends and other restricted pay-
ments, create liens or make investments or acquisitions. The
breach of any of the covenants could result in a default and
acceleration of payments of the indebtedness, which would
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. We consider ourselves able to maintain
the required financial ratios at present and in the near future.

Currencies and interests

We actively manage foreign currency and interest rate expo-
sures that are part of our normal business activities. Risk man-
agement procedures for foreign currencies and interest rate
exposures are based on strategies defined and, if necessary,
adapted in close cooperation with the Management Board,
including, for example, guidelines that cover all steps and levels
of the risk management process. They define responsibilities
for the determination of risks, the careful use of financial
instruments for hedging purposes and for accurate financial
reporting. The use of derivative instruments is restricted to

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

micro hedges which are used in order to hedge exposures that
arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not enter into
transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. We
enter into transactions with banks, which generally have rat-
ings in the "A" Category or better, as approved by the Manage-
ment Board. The effectiveness of the hedging relationships of
the hedging instruments and the hedged items is tested on a
quarterly basis.

We enter into derivatives, particularly interest rate swaps and
to a certain extent, interest rate options to protect against the
risk of rising interest rates. These interest rate derivatives are
designated as cash flow hedges and have been entered into in
order to effectively convert payments based on variable inter-
est rates into payments at a fixed interest rate. At Decem-
ber 31,2020 no interest rate swaps were in place. At Decem-
ber 31,2019, the notional amount of the euro-denominated
interest rate swaps in place was €O M.

Derivative foreign currency contracts are entered into for the
purpose of limiting the exchange rate exposure from sales
and purchases as well as lendings and borrowings between
our subsidiaries located in different countries and reporting
in different currencies. A large portion of the transaction
exposures arise from sales of products from our subsidiaries
in the euro region to other international business units. The
aggregate notional amount of foreign currency hedge con-
tracts as of December 31, 2020 was €1,672 M, primarily for
hedging Euro exposure to the U.S. dollar and various other
currencies. Economic hedges, which we use, are accounted for
as recognized hedges in the consolidated financial state-
ments, when necessary.

The estimation and quantification of transaction risks from for-
eign currencies is determined according to the statistical risk
measure Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR). CFaR indicates the maxi-
mum amount of a potential loss of the forecasted foreign

exchange cash flow of the next twelve months that occurs with
a probability of 95%. As of December 31, 2020, our CFaR
amounts to €59.6 M.

Further information on market, default and liquidity risks is
included in NOTE 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

Litigation and other exposures

Risks associated with investigations and litigations are contin-
uously identified, assessed and reported within the Company.
We are involved in various legal proceedings and investigations
resulting from our business operations. A negative outcome of
these legal proceedings or investigations leading to legal pro-
ceedings could have an adverse impact on our financial condi-
tion and results of operations.

External legal consulting support is always used to defend us
against risks associated with litigations. If necessary account-
ing measures like accruals are used.

For the matters in which we believe a loss is both reasonably
possible and assessable, an estimate of the loss or range of loss
exposure is provided in NOTE 22 of the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements. For other proceedings the Com-
pany believes that the loss probability is remote and/or the
loss or range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated
at this time.

For details on ongoing proceedings and further information
on material legal risks to which we are exposed, reference is
made to NOTE 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

72

Taxes

We are subject to ongoing tax audits in the U.S., Germany and
other jurisdictions. We could potentially receive notices of unfa-
vorable adjustments and disallowances in connection with cer-
tain of these audits. If we are unsuccessful in contesting unfa-
vorable determinations we could be required to make additional
tax payments, which could have a material adverse impact on
our business, financial condition and results of operations in
the relevant reporting period.

In general, tax-relevant issues are, as necessary, coordinated
with internal tax experts regarding compliance with applicable
tax laws. If necessary, statements and opinions by external con-
sultants are obtained to minimize tax risks.

International operations

We operate dialysis clinics in around 50 countries and sells a
range of equipment, products and services to customers in
around 150 countries. Our international operations are subject
to a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:

>The economic and political situation in certain countries
could deteriorate or become unstable.

>We could face difficulties in enforcing and collecting
accounts receivable under some countries’ legal systems.

> Local regulations could restrict our ability to obtain a direct
ownership interest in dialysis clinics or other operations.

>» Some countries or economic unions may impose charges or
restrictions, such as local content requirements, which
restrict the importation of our products.

> Potential increases in tariffs and trade barriers could occur
upon any withdrawal by the United States or other countries
from unions, including the exit from major multilateral trade
agreements or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs and other
countermeasures in the wake of trade disputes.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

> We could experience transport delays or interruptions.

> International growth and expansion into emerging markets
could cause us difficulty due to greater regulatory barriers
than in the United States or Western Europe, the necessity
of adapting to new regulatory systems, and problems related
to entering new markets with different economic, social,
legal and political systems and conditions.

> We may not prevail in competitive contract tenders.

We conduct humanitarian-related business directly or indi-
rectly in sanctioned countries. In case of violation of applicable
economic sanctions or export controls laws and regulations, we
could be subject to enforcement actions, which vary between
jurisdictions and depend on the factual circumstances of the
given violation, but could include criminal penalties, imprison-
ment of responsible individuals, administrative or civil penal-
ties, restricted access to certain markets and reputational
harm, among others.

Our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us
from deliberate, reckless or inadvertent acts of our employees
or agents that contravene our compliance policies or violate
applicable laws.

Any one or more of these or other factors relevant to interna-
tional operations could increase our costs, reduce revenues, or
disrupt operations, with possible material adverse effects on
our business and financial condition.

Developments of this nature are continuously monitored and
analyzed and response measures like the extension of local
production capacities, the adaptation of product designs, orga-
nizational changes and various others are set in place based on
case by case decisions.

Unpredictable events

We operate dialysis facilities or manufacturing facilities in
many regions of the world, with diverse geographic, societal
and economic conditions. Events such as natural disasters, ter-
rorist attacks, political instability, epidemics as well as other
unforeseeable events, could affect our services and our ability
to deliver in a limited time and place.

Through forward-looking planning and prevention programs,
trying to limit possible effects of such events already in
advance. In addition, to maintain operations in the event of an
onset and to reduce potential impact on our patients and the
organization, we have spare capacity and safety stock of cer-
tain resources as well as emergency and recovery plans in
place. Residual risks are eventually covered when necessary
and expedient by taking out insurance.

Global economic conditions and
disruptions in financial markets

We are dependent on the conditions of the financial markets
and the global economy. In order to pursue our business, we
are reliant on capital, as are our renal product customers and
commercial health care insurers. Limited or more expensive
access to capital in the financial markets could adversely affect
our business and profitability.

Among other things, the potential decline in federal and state
revenues may create additional pressures to contain or reduce
reimbursements for our services from public payors around the
world, including Medicare, Medicaid in the U.S. and other gov-
ernment sponsored programs in the U.S. and other countries
around the world.

Job losses or increases in unemployment rates may result in a
smaller percentage of our patients being covered by employer

73

group health plans and a larger percentage being covered by
lower paying government reimbursement programs. To the
extent that public and private payors are negatively impacted
by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pres-
sure on commercial rates, a further slowdown in collections
and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. These
developments as well a devaluation of currencies and worsen-
ing economic conditions, including inflationary cost increases
in various markets in connection with deteriorating country
credit ratings also increase the risk of a goodwill impairment,
which could lead to a partial or total goodwill write-off in the
affected cash generating units, or have a negative impact on
our investments and external partnerships.

In addition, these developments may have adverse effects in
other risk areas like U.S. federal health care programs, health
care reforms, reimbursement by private insurers, liquidity and
financing, currencies and interest, as well as procurement and
are reflected in the respective assessments.

Any or all of the abovementioned factors, or other conse-
quences of the continuation, or worsening, of domestic and
global economic conditions which cannot currently be pre-
dicted, could continue to have an adverse effect on our busi-
nesses and results of operations.

COVID-19

COVID-19 has resulted in a material deterioration of the condi-
tions for the global economy and financial markets. The finan-
cial impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition and results
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, has not been
material.

Going forward, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse
impact on our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and
distribution channels and increase our expenses, as a result of

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

(=e4Qp

impacts associated with preventive and precautionary mea-
sures that we, our suppliers, customers and other businesses
or governments implement or impose on a local, regional,
national or international level.

Given the already compromised health condition of typical dial-
ysis patients, our patients represent a heightened at-risk popu-
lation. Increased mortality rates in either the pre-end-stage
renal disease patient population or in our ESRD patient popula-
tion compared to the historical average are expected to mate-
rially and adversely affect our operating results for 2021.
Patients suffering from end-stage renal disease generally have
co-morbidities which has resulted, and may continue to result,
in more of our dialysis patients requiring hospitalization. Also,
it appears that COVID-19 has resulted in an increase in persons
experiencing temporary renal failure in many areas in which we
operate, and we expect to continue to incur additional staffing
costs required to meet the resulting increased demand for dial-
ysis treatment and/or to provide equipment and medical staff
needed for emergency treatments, for example in hospitals. We
expect negative effects through 2021 and in the mid-term on
our business depending mainly upon the adoption and speed of
the rollout of vaccinations.

Various governments in regions in which we operate have pro-
vided economic assistance programs to address the conse-
quences of the pandemic on companies and to support health-
care providers and patients. In the U.S., the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) has been
enacted to mitigate certain adverse financial impacts of the
pandemic, including impacts in the health care sector. Addi-
tional funding provided under the CARES Act and other COVID-
19 relief provides some financial support to our business in the
U.S. through suspension of the 2 % Medicare payment seques-
tration reduction from May 2020 to March 31, 2021, as well as
through accelerated and advance payments of Medicare reim-
bursement and grants to defray expenses and mitigate the loss

of revenues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these
measures may not fully offset potential lost revenues and
increased costs and we do not expect additional governmental
assistance during 2021.

Further legislation and amendments to existing legislation
intended to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse eco-
nomic consequences may be enacted in the markets in which
we operate. As the COVID-19 pandemic is prolonged, the risk of
further government intervention or measures to counteract
the pandemic could impact our business globally.

In addition, to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely
affects our business, net assets, financial condition and results
of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many
of the other risks described in this report.

Changes in the risk situation

We operate in a constantly changing environment. Accordingly,
the risk situation is also subject to constant change.

Regarding the classification of single risks in terms of probabil-
ity and potential impact, the following significant changes
occurred compared to the previous year:

One-year period:

Since all major commercial payor contracts are under agree-
ment for greater than one year, the risk from reimbursement
by private insurers (5) has decreased to a low risk.

The risk from health care reforms (6) is now considered a low
risk, which is mainly a result of the decreased uncertainty with
regards to reimbursements of Calcimimetics as they are now
reimbursed at a fixed rate.

74

The risks regarding Research & Development risk (9) as well as
tax issues (19) were assessed for the first time from a short-
term perspective and are considered a low and medium risk,
respectively.

The risk from global economic conditions (22) decreased to a low
risk due to the write-off of goodwill for region Latin America.

An assessment of potential adverse impacts on operational,
financial and strategic objectives that result from the COVID-19
pandemic and taken countermeasures (23) resulted in a
medium risk.

Five-year period:

Increasing competitor activities in the areas of home dialysis,
managed care and digital services increase risk from competi-
tors (8) to a medium risk.

An assessment of potential adverse impacts on operational,
financial and strategic objectives that result from the COVID-19
pandemic and taken countermeasures (23) resulted in a
medium risk.

OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT
Opportunities management system

As much of our business is organized by region, we are able to
identify industry-specific trends and requirements as well as
the resultant opportunities in the different regions at an early
stage and gear our actions to them. We also perform compre-
hensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to enable us to
capture business opportunities. This involves systematically
evaluating relevant market data, closely examining research
projects and taking general social trends into consideration.
Our analyses focus on general economic, industry-specific,
regional and local developments as well as regulatory changes.
In addition, our Strategy and Planning departments and the
managers of other divisions cooperate closely to allow us to
identify global opportunities as early as possible.

Opportunities

As a vertically integrated dialysis company, Fresenius Medical
Care can offer almost all of the products and services that
seriously and chronically ill patients require across the renal
care continuum. Our network of 4,092 dialysis clinics in
around 50 countries is the largest of its kind in the world. As
aresult, we possess valuable dialysis expertise that is unique
in the industry. Thanks to this wealth of experience, we know
that high quality is not only the key to a better quality of life
for patients, but can also make a significant contribution to
reducing the costs of health care. In this context, we are rely-
ing more than ever on digitization, which offers us new possi-
bilities in kidney therapy, especially in the field of telemedi-
cine and home dialysis. Numerous opportunities open up due
to regenerative medicine, especially in the area of cell thera-
pies, tissue engineering and transplants. Based on this under-
standing and our business model, major opportunities arise
that could have a positive impact on the results of operations,

financial position and net assets of Fresenius Medical Care as
things stand today. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities
mentioned apply to all segments.

Industry-specific opportunities

Growth in patient numbers and
demographic development

The dialysis market is a growth market that is largely unaf-
fected by common macroeconomic influences. According to
estimates, the number of people worldwide suffering from
chronic kidney failure and requiring dialysis treatment is rising
at a rate of around 3 to 6 % annually. It is expected to reach
around 3.8 M patients in 2021 and more than 6 M by 2030 (SEE
CHART 2.45). Social trends play a role in this increase in patient
numbers. In Europe and the U.S. in particular, they include the
aging population and the increasing incidence of diabetes and

hypertension, two illnesses that frequently precede the onset
of chronic kidney failure. In developing and emerging countries,
the growing population and steadily improved access to dialy-
sis as a result of increasing wealth are key factors that further
boost demand for dialysis products and services. We want to
continue to make a significant contribution to meeting this
demand in the future.

Changes in legal and political conditions

Whether private companies are allowed to offer dialysis treat-
ment and in what form depends on a country’s health care sys-
tem and its legal framework. For Fresenius Medical Care, oppor-
tunities arise to tap into new markets or to expand its market
share whenever a country opens up to private dialysis provid-
ers. This decision is also increasingly influenced by the follow-
ing factors:

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2020

q=a4aQ>p

> Health care systems are under pressure to deliver ever more
comprehensive medical care (longer life expectancy, increase
in concomitant diseases, health care provision still being
established).

> Dialysis is a complex, life-sustaining procedure, which places
high demands on health care systems in terms of expertise and
efficiency. Therefore, public health care providers are increas-
ingly collaborating with private providers to find solutions.

Growing demand for holistic, value-oriented health care

As a result of increasing cost pressure and the growing num-
ber of patients, demand for holistic and value-based health
care concepts for patients with chronic kidney failure is evolv-
ing worldwide. Value-oriented models are changing the role of
health care providers: In systems of this kind, we not only offer
dialysis, but also take responsibility for the patient's medical
well-being beyond dialysis.

Value-based health care models help to deliver higher-quality
treatment and better results at a lower cost. The aim here is to
establish sustainable partnerships with payors around the
world with the aim of driving forward the transition from fee-
for-service payment to pay-for-performance models.

We have supported this development from the start, because
we know the needs of our dialysis patients best. We have com-
bined the coordination of all aspects of medical care in our
“Care Coordination” business. This encompasses all services
that help us to offer our dialysis patients treatment across the
renal care continuum.

In 2019, the U.S. President signed an Executive Order on
advancing kidney health. Among other things, it directs the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop
new Medicare reimbursement models. One of these, the ESRD
Treatment Choices Model (ETC Model), is mandatory and

creates financial as well as other incentives for home dialysis
treatments and kidney transplants. The final rule for the ETC
Model was published in September 2020, comes into force in
2021, and provides fundamental opportunities for expanding
home dialysis and kidney transplants, particularly in the U.S.

Expansion of home dialysis

If patient numbers grow as strongly as anticipated, cost pres-
sure continues to rise and clinics reach full capacity, home
therapies are expected to take on a more important role in
dialysis, not only as a result of the ETC Model. This develop-
ment could be advantageous for Fresenius Medical Care, as it
presents us with growth opportunities. We offer a host of dif-
ferent products and innovative solutions for home dialysis. By
acquiring the U.S. company NxStage, which develops, pro-
duces and markets dialysis machines and other products for
home dialysis and intensive care, we have further expanded
our home dialysis portfolio. Digital solutions in the field of
telehealth and applications underpin our plans and are essen-
tial to be able to offer this form of therapy to more people. We
focus firmly on the needs of our patients by presenting them
with the widest possible range of therapy options. This gives
them the freedom to choose what form of treatment is cur-
rently best for them. Self-determination is a key pillar of our
vision to improve our patients’ quality of life.

Opportunities related
to our business operations

New products and technologies

Developing innovative products and technologies that deliver
lasting added value for patients and remuneration systems
right up until they are market-ready is another crucial factor in
our long-term success. We advance dialysis-related innovations
through our in-house research and development activities. In

addition, we are able to enhance existing products ourselves
and adapt them to the markets in which we operate. We will
continue to add innovative products and technologies to our
range in the future to capture growth opportunities and meet
the demand for integrated care as effectively as possible.

New forms of kidney therapy through di lization
Digitalization is a great opportunity for us. We aim to develop
new forms of kidney therapy with the help of digital technolo-
gies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and
use of Big Data. In North America, for example, we collect over
one terabyte of patient data every day to calculate risk models
and forecast multiple treatment paths. This data enables us to
assess the health of each patient more effectively. We can use
the information not only to reduce negative outcomes for
patients, but also to make costs, clinical workflows, production
and development processes more efficient.

COVID-19 in particular has prompted a significant acceleration
in the implementation of digital projects in telehealth and inte-
grated health care. They are key to our ability to increase the
share of home dialysis. We have already taken important steps
with Kinexus, a digital solution that comprehensively connects
our devices and our digital hubs for patients, providers and
care teams. In addition, we are digitalizing numerous business
processes to provide even better support for those working
from home. This offers us greater flexibility at a lower cost.

Disruptive treatment options through
regenerative medicine

We are investing in promising technologies and research
approaches in the field of regenerative medicine, which we
hope will present us with new, increasingly disruptive treat-
ment options in the long term. The focus here is on cell thera-
pies, tissue engineering and transplants.

As a result of our investment in Humacyte, we expect our
patients to have fewer complications, infections and surgical
procedures. Humacyte grows blood vessels from donated mus-
cle cells in a bioreactor. Depending on the results of research
trials, these blood vessels could provide safer and more stable
vascular access and reduce catheter contact time for hemodi-
alysis patients in the future. Beyond its use for dialysis access,
the human acellular vessel (HAV) is also promising for treating
peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and traumas.

Fresenius Medical Care holds further participations in the
field of regenerative medicine through Unicyte AG and
Fresenius Medical Care Ventures GmbH. These have enabled
us to expand our range of treatments in this area, particularly
in early phases of chronic kidney disease. In addition, we have
made substantial progress in the field of transplants through
eGenesis, a company that has developed a multiplex platform
based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We expect this
approach to enable safe and effective xenotransplantation,
e.g. from pigs to humans.

Thanks to our extensive commitment to regenerative medicine,
our aim is not only to provide state-of-the-art options for renal
replacement in the future, but also to substitute the function of
other organs. We are confident that patients with diabetes or
cardiovascular diseases can also benefit from our innovative
and transformative therapies.

Growing demand for critical care solutions

The number of patients requiring continuous renal replacement
therapy to treat acute kidney failure is set to rise to 1.6 M per
year by 2030. Fresenius Medical Care will expand its acute care
portfolio to include other extracorporeal critical care therapy
areas, such as the treatment of acute heart, lung and multi-
organ failure.

Investments and complementary assets

We generate ideas for growth initiatives from market analyses
and assess them as part of our annual budget planning, or
more frequently if necessary. We manage the investments
required for implementing projects using a detailed coordina-
tion and evaluation process. The Management Board sets the
investment budget for the Group as well as the focus of invest-
ment. Before realizing investment projects, an internal commit-
tee examines the individual projects and measures, taking into
account their yield requirements and potential return on invest-
ment. Projects are undertaken only if they help to increase the
Company's value.

We will supplement and strengthen our existing network where
feasible through additional partnerships, investments and
acquisitions in the field of research and development. This will
help us to create added medical value while saving costs. The
close collaboration between our Strategy and Planning depart-
ments and the managers responsible for our acquisitions
means that we can identify suitable potential purchases world-
wide at an early stage. It will allow us to build an even stronger
and more resilient foundation for our future growth to 2025
and beyond.

Internal organization and procedures

Fresenius Medical Care benefits from a number of long-term
opportunities in the way it is organized and designs its business
operations. For example, all production sites follow the lean
manufacturing approach. In North America and at our Schwein-
furt plant, this includes the Lean Six Sigma management sys-
tem. The focus of lean manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma is on
continuously improving manufacturing processes to achieve a
low defect rate and, consequently, better product quality while
reducing manufacturing times. In addition, constantly improv-
ing business processes and rigorously optimizing cost struc-

77

tures will allow Fresenius Medical Care to become even more
profitable and competitive. Thanks to its global efficiency pro-
gram, the Company has brought about a continuous and sus-
tainable increase in efficiency.

Sustainability

To identify, assess and capture the opportunities associated
with sustainability, Fresenius Medical Care continuously ana-
lyzes key economic, social and environmental issues. In doing
so, we look at the entire value chain of our business activities.
Developing an effective global sustainability management sys-
tem is an opportunity for us to embed sustainability in our busi-
ness activities systematically and structurally. Our sustainabil-
ity management system helps us to maintain our reputation
and acceptance in society and to meet increased demand for
sustainability in our business operations from key interest
groups. This results in further opportunities for Fresenius
Medical Care to position itself as a reliable, efficient partner
and an attractive employer.

Fresenius Medical Care's business model

Our business model itself also provides opportunities for
Fresenius Medical Care’s future growth. As a vertically inte-
grated dialysis company, we not only offer almost all of the
products and services that a patient with chronic kidney failure
requires for treatment, but also use these on a daily basis in our
own clinics. As a result, we can incorporate the feedback from
our patients, physicians and nurses worldwide in developing
and manufacturing new products as well as in organizing our
clinic management. This gives us a crucial competitive edge.

ASSESSMENT OF

THE OVERALL RISK POSITION
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES BY
THE MANAGEMENT

Our risk management system forms the basis for assessing over-
all risk. The overall risk position of Fresenius Medical Care is
determined by the individual risks described above. Changes in
the Group's risk situation compared to the previous year
occurred as stated in the paragraph of the same name starting
on PAGE 74. As far as we are aware, there are currently no risks
that could endanger the continued existence of Fresenius Medi-
cal Care. In the course of the Company-wide review as part of the
integrated management system, we also monitor the effective-
ness of the implemented risk management system and make
improvements where necessary. The Management Board will
continue to expand our risk management as well as the review of
the associated management system to be able to identify, exam-
ine and evaluate potential risks even more quickly and initiate
appropriate countermeasures. We believe that we have taken all
necessary organizational steps to recognize potential risks early
on and to respond to them appropriately.

We furthermore remain confident that our integrated global
business model and our earning power provide us with a sound
basis for our business development, allowing us to capture the
opportunities arising for the Company. In view of our leading
position in the dialysis market, our innovative strength, our ded-
icated staff and our structured processes for identifying risks
early on and managing opportunities, we are convinced that we
can continue to make the most of any opportunities that arise
for our business in a responsible manner in the future.
