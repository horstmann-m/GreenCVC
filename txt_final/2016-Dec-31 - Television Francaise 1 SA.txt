MESSAGE FROM GILLES PELISSON

MESSAGE FROM GILLES PELISSON

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

Your Group is operating in a world where the free-to-air television offering
continues to expand and where global internet players are becoming
increasingly active. Against this background, we can draw upon our huge
talent pool to explore all creative avenues and technological innovations
and thereby offer viewers increasingly immersive experiences.

During 2016 we have been engaged in a process of transforming
our Group, and we have already achieved a lot. Our multi-channel
strategy has taken on a new dimension with the repositioning of
TMC, and LCI has successfully relaunched in the universe of free-to-
air channels, as witness the fine audience figures for the fourth quarter
of 2016. In production, our acquisition of a stake in Newen Studios
opens up a range of possibilities in content creation and distribution,
both internationally and in France, and we have signed agreements
with the industry to achieve a better balance between producers and
broadcasters. We have ramped up our digital activities in order to attract
millennials, who will rejuvenate our mass-market TV audiences. Hence
our decisions to take a majority stake in MinuteBuzz and a minority stake
~ alongside two major European broadcasters from Italy and Germany —
in the international MCN Studio 71, with the aim of developing the brand
in France, with the support of Finder Studios.

And finally, this year we have implemented an action plan to identify
sources of productivity and improve our profitability.

Our operating methods have been streamlined to enable us to be bolder,
more fleet-of-foot and more agile in our decision-making. Every one
of our employees must be able to fully express his/her potential and
contribute positively to the income growth of the company. In them,
we have a pool of talents that is lively, imaginative and capable of re-
inventing itself.

4 WHEAT recistration Document 2016

In this sense, 2017 will see even more substantial evidence of our
ambitions as a multi-channel, multi-media, multi-activity group coming
to fruition. Our teams are fired up with the will to win, determined to
continue our transformation initiatives with the same energy and
commitment as before.

We are primed and ready to strengthen our leadership in television,
innovate in services to advertisers, accelerate our growth in production
and digital, showcase our brands across all platforms, increase our
profitability, and create value for our people and shareholders.

Boulogne, 8 March 2017

EMPLOYEES @

TF1 is an integrated media group with a vocation to
inform and entertain.

Broadcaster of France’s leading free-to-air channel,
the TF1 group provides content and an offering adapted
to all platforms.

TF1 is the leading private-sector free-to-air broadcaster in France. It broadcasts five
complementary free-to-air channels (TF1, TMC, NT1, HD1 and LCI)", which together had
an average 32.1% share of the key “women under 50 purchasing decision-makers” target
audience in 2016

This positioning is strengthened by the Group's constant adaptation to new ways of
consuming content. So TF1 is adding a high-powered digital dimension to its channels. It
is also offering exclusive digital content and video-on-demand in order to reach all audiences
on all platforms.

The Group screens the following high-quality theme channels on pay-TV to meet special-
interest demand: TV Breizh, Histoire, Ushuaia and Serieclub (60% holding).

TF1's sales house offers advertisers the combined benefits of access to its mass-
market television channels and to personal digital media. It also sells advertising space on
independent radio stations and numerous websites.

In conjunction with its core business, the TF1 group is present in the production and
distribution of content relating to its own channels. The main aim of taking a majority
stake in Newen was to accelerate the international expansion of production and distribution

Finally, the TF1 group has created a large range of complementary businesses in key areas
such as home shopping, licences, board games, music and entertainment production, etc.

As a media group, TF1 is aware of its responsibilities and is engaged in high-quality
dialogue with all its stakeholders in order to enhance transparency and continually
improve its practices.

MATERIALITY MATRIX

TF1 GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT
1. THE GROUP AND ITS ENVIRONMENT.

THE MATERIALITY MATRIX RANKS CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
CONCERNS RELATING TO THE TF1 GROUP

An initial materiality study was conducted with internal and external
stakeholders in 2014. In 2016, a new survey was carried out, targeting
the Group's employees in particular.

The list of concerns was revised to take into account:

‘the previous mapping exercise;

‘the needs of extra-financial ratings agencies (in particular DJSI, Oekom,
Vigeo);

the audiovisual regulatory framework (terms of reference agreed with
the CSA);

the CSR reporting benchmark and the materiality mapping of other
French and anglophone media;

key word occurrences in the press (4 national daily newspapers) in
the last two years.

Employees were asked to rank 17 concerns relating to content produced
or broadcast by the Group and to the conduct of the Group, including

MATERIALITY MATRIX OF THE TF1 GROUP

Importance for stakeholders ———————————_»

two new ones (cultural diversity in content and responsible advertising),
according to people's expectations of the Group.

The importance of those concerns for TF1 in terms of the impact on
its business was then assessed by the members of the Executive
Committee in charge of Strategy and CSR, as well as the Investor
Relations Department and Internal Control.

The main changes between the first and second mapping exercises relate
to the growing importance for the business of:

= data management, which has now become a monetisable asset and
hence more important to the Group;

= editorial independence and news media pluralism, in conjunction
with societal expectations and the French law passed in this area in
2016 (law no. 2016-1524 of 14 November 2016 on strengthening media
freedom, independence and pluralism);

= upskilling employees and evolving working methods, crucial in
an increasingly digital ecosystem.

= his length of service with the Group;

= practices within the Group or within companies carrying on comparable
activities.

4. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

MACRO
TRENDS

GROWING APPETITE
FOR PREMIUM VIDEO CONTENT

CONTEXT Premium video content continues to attract mass audiences, especially around news, sport and drama blockbusters. In France, 9 of the
10 best audiences were for major sporting events, while there has been a big increase in audiences for French drama.
At the same time the audiovisual production offering has been growing globally. In the United States, the number of series has more than
doubled in 10 years".
Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix are the main drivers of growth in this area, which they are using to recruit new customers.
Intense competition to acquire the best formats means this content now costs more.
(1) FX Network Research.

ate AURTnTS In order to secure access to content, broadcasters are moving up the value chain by seeking to own their own audiovisual formats.
Hence the TF1 group's recent acquisition of production companies (notably Newen), the development of in-house production facilities and

CHANGING USAGE AND THE EMERGENCE
OF NEW FORMATS

Ways of consuming content are changing rapidly:
consumers want to be able to access the maximum.
content via a minimum of entry points, whenever
they want and wherever they are (trend towards
platformization).

The growing consumption of content on mobile
devices, especially by young people, requires for-
mats that are adapted to modes of consumption:
snacking on mobiles and binge watching OTT and
on the web.

Consumer choice is now based on quality and price.
Consumers are abandoning the traditional prepaid
packages in favour of pay-per-view.

3)

INCREASINGLY PERSONALISED
OFFERING

In response to the individualisation of consumption
made possible by mobiles, audiovisual players are
upgrading their functionalities to offer consumers a
personalised experience, using algorithms based on
data collected by their usage databases.

The advertisements shown are adapted to user

profiles in order to obtain better engagement and
commercial effectiveness.

4. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

°o

MORE AND MORE ENGAGED
AND IMMERSIVE CONSUMPTION

The development of social networks is transforming
the media landscape: they are a major lever on
audiences and also a new point of entry and inte-
raction for users.

This public engagement is becoming even more
important because of the new immersive techno-
logies (augmented reality, virtual reality, etc.), which
enable users to become totally invested in those
universes.

New modes of consumption are broadening conven-
tional free-to-air TV players’ scope for exploiting
content.

TF1 group content is now available in multiple for-
mats (direct, catch-up, bonus, etc.) suited to these
new habits (e.g. binge watching).

The Group is also strongly expanding its exclusive
content for new platforms in order to reach younger
generations. Hence its acquisition of MinuteBuzz and
a stake in Studio 71.

This is enabling the Group to diversify its revenue
sources through “freemium” (mixed free/pay-per-
view) offerings, funded with or without advertising.

Historically, the TF1 group has broadcast a broad
big-hitting offering to satisfy the largest number of
viewers.

The Group is working to ally this with an offering that
can be personalised by collecting data, subject to
strict compliance with legal restrictions.

This is enabling the Group to improve user expe-
tience while selling advertisers appropriate and
effective programming slots. The Group is promoting
the emergence of innovative advertising formats,
such as brand content.

Televised media have major resonance in social
networks, with TV programmes breaking records in
the twittersphere.

The Group has a strong social media profile so
that it can communicate with followers. Acquiring
MinuteBuzz will increase the Group's social media
presence.

TF1 GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT
7, OUTLOOK

7. OUTLOOK

2016 was a year of transformation, in which the TF1 group set new
operational priorities and implemented a new organisational structure.
In 2017, we will push ahead with a resolutely multi-channel, multi-
media and multi-activity strategy, combining pulling power with targeted
reach on each channel and developing growth areas in DTT, digital and
production.

To meet these challenges, the Group will strive to:

= develop attractive and distinctive content with a competitive cost base,
in particular by expanding our production activities;

= broaden the distribution of content by multiplying the number of
distribution channels and strengthening the bond with the viewer/
consumer;

= improve the monetisation of both linear and non-linear content.

This strategy should help us improve our profitability: we are targeting
double-digit current operating margin in 2019, with growth in non-
advertising revenue for the five free-to-air channels expected to account
for at least one-third of our consolidated revenue in that year.

On the production side, taking a stake in Newen Studios has opened
many new opportunities in the creation and distribution of content, both
in France and internationally. Our ongoing expansion in digital, across

22 LGM recistration DOCUMENT 2016

all devices and networks, is intended to help us reach new targets with
rejuvenated content, and better monetise user activity.

We will continue to apply our rigorous management approach, which from
2017 onwards will enable us to:

@ limit the cost of programmes by optimising our investment in content.
This will involve an overhaul of our rights buying policy, increasing in-
house production, and developing content for digital devices. Over
the next three years, this policy should enable the Group to hold the
average annual cost of programmes (excluding major sporting events)
for our five free-to-air channels at €980 million;

achieve €25 million to €30 million of recurring savings (excluding cost
of programmes) under the Recover plan;

= maintain our share of the advertising market by extracting maximum
value from our premium inventories, and growing our DTT channels
and digital content;

take new initiatives in distribution so as to maximise the value of our
services, both in France and internationally.

Our ambition is to strengthen our leadership in television, innovate in
services to advertisers, accelerate our growth in production and digital,
and showcase our brands across all platforms.
