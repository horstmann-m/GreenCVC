Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Management report of
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Structure and organisation

Commerzbank is one of Germany’s leading banks for private and
corporate clients and an internationally active commercial bank.
Domestically, it has one of the densest branch networks of any
private-sector bank in Germany, with approximately 1,000
branches, serving a total of around 18.8 million private and small-
business customers and over 70,000 corporate clients including
multinational groups, financial service providers and institutional
clients worldwide.

As part of its strategy, Commerzbank is focusing its business
activities on the two core segments Private and Small-Business
Customers and Corporate Clients, offering them a comprehensive
portfolio of banking and capital market services. The run-off seg-
ment Asset & Capital Recovery (ACR) comprises — besides the Pub-

lic Finance business — all non-strategic activities of commercial
real estate and ship finance. Each segment is managed by a mem-
ber of the Board of Managing Directors.

All staff and management functions are contained in Group

Management: Group Audit, Group Communications, Group Com-
pliance, Group Finance, Group Human Resources, Group Investor
Relations, Group Legal, Group Tax, Group Treasury, Big Da-
ta & Advanced Analytics and the central risk functions. The support
functions are provided by Group Services. These include Group
Digital Transformation & Strategy, Group Banking Operations,
Group Markets Operations, Group Information Technology, Group
Organisation & Security and Group Delivery Centre. The staff,
management and support functions are combined in the Others
and Consolidation division for reporting purposes.
On the domestic market, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is
headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, from where it manages a
nationwide branch network through which all customer groups are
served. Its major German subsidiaries are comdirect bank AG and
Commerz Real AG. Outside of Germany, the Bank has 6 material
subsidiaries, 20 operational foreign branches and 31 representa-
tive offices in just under 50 countries and is represented in all ma-
jor financial centres, such as London, New York, Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Singapore. However, the focus of the Bank’s interna-
tional activities is on Europe.

The financial year is the calendar year.

Corporate responsibility

Corporate responsibility is a guiding principle at Commerzbank.
Ecological, social and ethical criteria play a central role in our cor-
porate management. Through our core business we want to influ-
ence sustainable development, provide fair and competent advice
to our customers, consistently shrink our environmental footprint,
be an attracttive employer for our staff and show our commitment
to society. Our corporate responsibility website
https://www.sustainability.commerzbank.com provides an over-
view of the Commerzbank sustainability strategy and the objec-

tives of its sustainability programme.

Our employees

Our employees make a key contribution to the success of the busi-
ness. Thanks to their commitment and skills, we are well placed to
hold our own against the competition and achieve our economic
objectives over the longer term. Our goal is to constantly make
Commerzbank a more attractive employer as a result of our HR.
activities. To do this we want to create an environment where staff
are able to develop their abilities as best they can. At the same
time, they should be able to manage a good work/life balance. Our
corporate culture has a consistent understanding of leadership,
values and principles of conduct. These provide guidance for our
employees in treating each other and our customers and business
partners fairly and professionally.

Owing to the integration of IT subsidiary Commerz Systems
GmbH into Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft there was a rise in
the number of employees at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as
at 31 December 2018. The number of employees on the reporting
date was 34,001, as compared to 33,850 at the end of 2017.

Commerzbank continues to drive forward
digitalisation

Commerzbank drove its strategic Commerzbank 4.0 programme
further forward in 2018, pursuing the objective of developing into
a digital enterprise. HR assisted the business units in moving to
the new target structure and continued to implement the job re-
ductions planned by 2020 on schedule and in a way which is so-
cially responsible. We set up a portal called “New Perspectives” so
employees are well prepared for the Bank's change process. This
gives staff an opportunity to learn about internal and external op-

portunities. They can explore their professional options and are
given support preparing for a change of work.

Restructuring head office to improve the
Bank's performance

Commerzbank started a fundamental restructuring of its Group
head office in 2018 with Campus 2.0. This programme is the next
stage in transforming the Bank into a digital enterprise. In future,
every product and service will be developed and run by a clearly
defined organisational unit known as a “cluster”. The new cluster
delivery organisation will be an integral part of the Bank. We are
doing this to make the Bank more efficient and improve perfor-
mance, so as to be faster and more flexible in the market and for
customers. HR played a major part in Campus 2.0 in negotiating
with the employee representatives and designing and implementing
the staffing changes needed to restructure the Group head office.

Making employees fit for digital transformation

We want our employees and managers to be optimally prepared
for the digital world. We will only be able to develop into a digital
enterprise if the Bank succeeds in this transformation. Hence, we
are offering measures across the Bank to help employees and
managers extend what they know about digitalisation. We provide
both in-class lectures and events and innovative online tutorials. In
additional we teach our employees a great deal about agile work-
ing methods.

We are also breaking new ground in the way we bring on the
next generation of managers. Last year we launched our interna-
tional trainee programme in digital banking, attracting many
graduates in STEM subjects to Commerzbank. During the year
under review we again hired just under 20 graduates for the train-
ee programme. This will allow us to expand the skills required for
our digital strategy.

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

Digitalisation is also being felt in HR. Last year we modernised
a host of HR products and launched new digital products, includ-
ing a new employee portal and a new study platform. Our aim is to
further digitalise and simplify our HR products and processes.

Strong culture of integrity promotes the
long-term growth of the Bank

Compliance and integrity are firmly integrated in our corporate
culture. They protect our reputation, strengthen our brand and
help us to achieve long-tern business success.

In 2018 we presented the “Culture of Integrity” award for the
first time. This goes to employees who have demonstrated conduct
that exemplifies integrity.

For years our ComValues have formed the basis of a binding
corporate culture that unites us. Commerzbank revised the
ComValues during the year under review and added the word
“courage”. We strongly believe that everyone has to have the
courage to follow new paths and take responsibility for their own
actions. This includes deliberately not doing some things and
learning from mistakes.

Our updated code of conduct is based on our ComValues; this
was introduced across the Group in stages following a revision last
year. It provides us with orientation for acting correctly and moral-
ly impeccably in our daily work. At the same time, the Bank fur-
ther expanded the process for managing consequences. This de-
fines a consistent approach for handling breaches of legal
regulations, regulatory requirements or internal guidelines.

Diversity management firmly embedded in the
HR strategy

Commerzbank has a corporate culture of diversity and inclusive-
ness, and these form key elements of our HR work. We are clearly
committed to a working environment that is free from prejudice
and where the individuality and diversity of our employees, cus-
tomers and business partners are not only accepted but desired.
We are confident that we also profit from this as a bank. We want
to continue strengthening understanding for this among our em-
ployees and managers in future.

As a signatory to the diversity charter we took part in numerous
campaigns during the year, including German Diversity Day and
the “#Flag for diversity” campaign. Our activities focused on in-
cluding people with disabilities. In 2018, Commerzbank became
the first bank in Germany to publish an action plan for inclusion
based on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disa-
bilities. It committed itself to implementing numerous measures
by 2023 to improve the situation for people with disabilities in the
Bank and in their business relationships. Commerzbank also sup-
ported the newly established employee network IDEAL, for people
with disabilities.

Bank committed to work/life balance

We strongly believe that our employees are better motivated and
perform better when they have a good work/life balance. We
therefore have a range of offerings to support them in this respect
at different stages of life. These include, for example, childcare ar-
rangements, flexible working time models and part-time working
options like “Keep in Touch”. We also feel it is important to support
employees who have to care for family members. Commerzbank
has worked for many years with professional partners who advise
employees and arrange services.

We won several prizes and awards this year for taking account
of family issues and the different stages of life in our HR policy.
The Bank’s range of events and various staff networks also give
employees the opportunity to learn and swap experiences within
and outside the Bank.

The Bank remains committed to encouraging
female managers

In 2018, Commerzbank signed the United Nations Women’s Em-
powerment Principles. In doing so the Bank committed itself to
promoting gender equality and strengthening the position of
women in the company.

Encouraging female managers remains an important objective
for Commerzbank. The Bank was able to employ more women in
management positions (30.8%) in the year under review than in
2017. This moves the Bank closer to its target of having 35% of
management positions held by women by the end of 2021. To
achieve this, the Bank took various measures during the year.
Whenever a management position has to be filled, discussions will
always be held with both male and female candidates before a de-
cision is taken on the appointment. Qualifications and skills re-
main the key considerations when filling positions.

Extensive offerings for promoting employee
health

Commerzbank goes well beyond the legal requirements when it
comes to promoting employee health. We firmly believe that
healthy living and working has a positive impact on motivation and
performance. Health objectives have therefore been an integral
part of our HR policy for many years. Our health offering is wide-
ranging and aims to better equip employees and managers to deal
with the health challenges that arise from the digital restructuring
of the world of work.

We also offer our staff training opportunities and health-related
activities to encourage healthy behaviour in their daily working
lives. Commerzbank again took part in the Global Challenge “step”
competition; some 1,600 employees walked a total of over 1.5 mil-
lion kilometres. Around 160 company sports groups are available
to staff at Commerzbank across the country, offering more than 50
different types of sport.

In addition to physical health, Commerzbank's holistic and in-
tegrated approach to company health management means it also
takes employees’ mental health very seriously. The Employee As-
sistance Programme provides our staff with skilled advice in diffi-
cult personal and professional situations.

Attractive company benefits for employees

Along with remuneration, Commerzbank offers its employees oth-
er attractive benefits as a further means of creating a good work-
ing environment, showing recognition and positioning ourselves
as an attractive employer. Commerzbank supplements the statutory
pension with a company pension. In 2018, we also enhanced our
tax-privileged direct insurance and pension fund deferred com-
pensation models in line with the new German Company Pension
Act (Betriebsrentenstarkungsgesetz or BetrAVG). As in previous
years, our employees were also able to use numerous extras such
as leasing Bank cars and bikes. Around 6,500 employees made use
of these offers. The Bank is also encouraging electromobility and
for the second time offered employees the chance to try an electric
car on a leasing basis. Once again, our employees were also able
to lease high-end IT devices for private use. Some 7,000 employ-
ees made use of this offer, with around 18,000 devices being or-
dered.

Remuneration

As a result of the increased significance arising from greater regu-
lation, remuneration of all employees below the level of the Board
of Managing Directors is disclosed in a separate report (remunera-
tion report pursuant to Art. 16 of the Remuneration Ordinance for
Institutions (Institutsvergiitungsverordnung)). This is published
annually on the Commerzbank website at www.commerzbank.com.

Remuneration report

This report follows the recommendations of the German Corporate
Governance Code and complies with the requirements of the Ger-
man Commercial Code (HGB).

Board of Managing Directors

Remuneration system for the Board of Managing Directors

The Supervisory Board ratified the remuneration system for the
members of the Board of Managing Directors in December 2014;
it has been in force since 1 January 2015. It had become necessary
to introduce a new system to bring the remuneration of the Board
of Managing Directors into line with new and/or amended rules
under the Capital Requirements Directive IV, the German Banking
Act and the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions. The system.
also needed to be simplified, so as to improve its transparency and
its clarity in respect of success measurement. However, the com-
ponents of the old system that had not been paid out in full by
1 January 2015 continue to be governed exclusively by the rules of
that system, which is described in the remuneration report for
2014. This now only concerns the share component from the long-
term remuneration components (LTI components) for the 2014
financial year, which will be paid out in April 2019. On
7 November 2018, the Supervisory Board made the decision to
amend the remuneration system to bring it into line with the re-
vised version of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions of
4 August 2017. It also decided to convert some of the variable re-
muneration components into fixed remuneration components. The
changes entered into force on 1 January 2019 and have been con-
tractually agreed with all members of the Board of Managing Di-
rectors. An overview of the main changes can be found at the end
of this section. The following describes the remuneration system
as applied in the 2018 financial year.

Core elements of the remuneration system The core elements
of the remuneration system are a fixed basic annual salary plus
variable remuneration with a uniform target amount. The appro-
priateness of the fixed basic annual salary and the variable remu-
neration is checked regularly at two-year intervals. The 2015 An-

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

nual General Meeting approved the remuneration system and an up-
per limit for variable remuneration of 140% of fixed remuneration.

Fixed remuneration components The fixed remuneration com-
ponents include the basic annual salary and non-monetary ele-
ments. The basic annual salary is €750 thousand for ordinary
members of the Board of Managing Directors. The Chairman of
the Board of Managing Directors receives 1.75 times this amount,
ie. €1,312,500. This is payable in 12 equal monthly instalments.
The non-monetary elements mainly consist of the use of a compa-
ny car with driver, security measures and insurance contributions
(accident insurance), and the applicable tax thereon. Board mem-
bers are also entitled to company pension arrangements, which
are set down in pension agreements and described in a separate
section below.

Performance-related remuneration components (variable remu-
neration) The remuneration system provides for a variable remu-
neration component linked to the achievement of targets set at the
start of each financial year. The variable remuneration is calculat-
ed based on the (i) economic value added (EVA) target achieve-
ment by the Commerzbank Group, (ii) target achievement by the
department (segment and/or shared functions) for which the
member of the Board of Managing Directors in question is respon-
sible, and (iii) achievement of individual performance targets. Tar-
get achievement for the Group and the department and individual
performance can each be between 0% and 200%; however, the
overall level of target achievement from these three components is
limited to 150%. Multiplying the overall level of target achieve-
ment by the target amount for variable remuneration purposes
gives the total amount of variable remuneration based on target
achievement. Thus, the total amount of variable remuneration
based on target achievement is capped at a maximum of 150% of
the Board member's target variable remuneration.

> Target amount The target amount of variable remuneration is
€1,000,000 for the ordinary members of the Board of Managing
Directors and €1,628,640 for the Chairman, based on target
achievement of 100%. The Supervisory Board may reduce the tar-
get amount if this is necessary to comply with the maximum ratio
of fixed to variable remuneration. This can happen if non-
monetary benefits or the service cost for the company pension
arrangements for members of the Board of Managing Directors
are reduced, as these are both included in the fixed remuneration.

> Target setting Before the beginning of each financial year, the
Supervisory Board sets targets for the members of the Board of
Managing Directors:

© Company targets The Supervisory Board sets targets based on
economic value added (EVA) or another measures that it may

choose for the Group and for the departments for which the
member of the Board of Managing Directors in question is re-
sponsible and determines the respective target attainment per-
centages on this basis.

In 2018, the Supervisory Board formulated the Group target for
all of the members of the Board of Managing Directors as a
performance curve on the basis of EVA values. Further targets
set by the Supervisory Board included corresponding perfor-
mance curves for the Private and Small-Business Customers
and Corporate Clients segments. The performance curves are
based on the expected return of the Group or segments and not
on one-year targets or sales targets. In addition to the quantita-
tive targets, the Supervisory Board also set qualitative targets
specific to the departments for which the respective members
of the Board of Managing Directors are responsible. The quali-
tative targets pertain in particular to aspects of implementing
the Commerzbank 4.0 strategy, such as promoting cultural will-
ingness to change and implementing the new advisory models
in the customer segments of the Bank. Furthermore, the Su-
pervisory Board set targets for attaining the intended earnings
growth and cost reductions, such as increasing new business
volumes in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment
and increasing market share in the Corporate Client business,
and targets for digitalisation and automation. The Supervisory
Board also set specific compliance and risk targets.

° Individual targets The Supervisory Board also sets individual
performance targets for the members of the Board of Managing
Directors.

For 2018, for example, these included achieving the digital
change targets, promoting the Group’s ability to innovate and
achieving maximum performance from the Bank's digital cam-
pus. Other targets included promoting, developing and motivat-
ing managers and employees, sustainable implementation of
appropriate compliance and ensuring a high standard of risk
management. Lastly, the Supervisory Board defined employee
and customer satisfaction and perception of the Bank as a digi-
tal enterprise as individual targets.

> Target achievement Following the end of each financial year,
the Supervisory Board decides on the extent to which the targets
were achieved. The measurement of target achievement for com-
pany targets is based 70% on the Group's business success and
30% on the results and target achievement of the departments for
which the Board member in question is responsible. Target
achievement is measured over a three-year period, with achieve-
ment of the company targets for the financial year in question be-
ing given a weighting of 3/6, the previous year 2/6 and the year
before that 1/6.

A transitional arrangement applies to the first two years for
newly appointed members of the Board of Managing Directors.
The results of the three-year achievement of the company targets
are then multiplied by a factor of between 0.7 and 1.3, which is
dependent on the Board member's achievement of the individual
targets. 0.7 corresponds to individual target achievement of 0%
(minimum), 1.0 to individual target achievement of 100% and 1.3
to individual target achievement of 200% (maximum). For inter-
mediate figures, the Supervisory Board defines the factors in in-
crements when setting the targets. Individual target achievement
in 2018 lay in a range between 100% and 130%, resulting in cor-
responding factors of between 1.0 and 1.2.

Variable remuneration will only be applied if the Group
achieves a profit before taxes and before adjusting for non-
controlling interests according to IFRS.

The Supervisory Board may resolve to reduce or cancel the var-
iable remuneration if necessary, for example to take account of the
Bank's risk-bearing capacity or ability to ensure that it can main-
tain or rebuild sufficient capital or liquidity resources over the long
term or to safeguard its ability to meet the capital buffer require-
ments of the German Banking Act. If predefined levels are not met,
the Supervisory Board must cancel the variable remuneration. The
Supervisory Board must also cancel the variable remuneration of a
member of the Board of Managing Directors if said member has
committed a serious breach of duty during the financial year in
question prior to the determination of target achievement.

For 2018, the Supervisory Board reduced the respective arith-
metic levels of overall target achievement, and hence the variable
remuneration, of the members of the Board of Managing Direc-
tors, applying an adjustment clause under the rules of the remu-
neration system applicable to the Board of Managing Directors.
Instead of the respective arithmetic levels of overall target
achievement, the Supervisory Board decided — in line with the re-
quest of the members of the Board of Managing Directors — to ad-
just the figure to the respective allocation ratios for variable em-
ployee remuneration in the different departments. The result was a
reduction in the arithmetic level of overall target achievement to
figures between 24% and 30%.

> Short-Term Incentive (STI) 40% of the variable remuneration
takes the form of a Short-Term Incentive. Entitlement to the STI
arises upon determination by the Supervisory Board of the total
amount of variable remuneration based on target achievement and
notification to the member of the Board of Managing Directors in
question. Half of this remuneration component is payable in cash;
the other half is payable after a 12-month waiting period, also in
cash but based on share price performance. The share-based half
is linked to the performance of the Commerzbank share since the
end of the financial year in respect of which the STI was awarded.


--- Page 6 ---

>» Long-Term Incentive (LTI) The remaining 60% of the variable
remuneration takes the form of a Long-Term Incentive. Entitle-
ment to the LTI arises only after a five-year retention period and is
subject to a retrospective performance evaluation. The retrospec-
tive performance evaluation can result in the LTI being reduced or
cancelled completely. This mainly applies when facts subsequently
emerge which reveal that the original calculation of target
achievement was incorrect, or the Bank’s capital adequacy has
significantly deteriorated due to circumstances related to that
financial year. This would also apply if there had been a significant
failure in risk management in that financial year at Group level or
in a department for which the Board member is responsible, or if
the Bank’s financial position at the time of the retrospective per-
formance evaluation or at the end of the ensuing waiting period
precluded payment. Half of the LTI element resulting from the ret-
rospective performance evaluation is payable in cash and half after
a further 12-month waiting period, also in cash but share-based.
As with the share-based part of the STI, the share-based half of LTI
is linked to the performance of the Commerzbank share since the
end of the financial year in respect of which the LTI was awarded.
The share-based half of the LTI therefore reflects the performance
of the Commerzbank share during the five-year retention period
and the subsequent waiting period.

Remuneration for serving on the boards of affiliated compa-
nies The remuneration accruing to an individual member of the
Board of Managing Directors from serving on the boards of affili-
ated companies counts towards the total remuneration paid to the
Board member in question.

Pension provision

Rules for members of the Board of Managing Directors in office
in 2011 The company pension scheme adopted in 2011 by the
Supervisory Board for members of the Board of Managing
Directors contains a defined contribution benefit for members of
the Board of Managing Directors in office at the time.

Each member of the Board of Managing Directors receives a
credit of a pension module to their pension account every year
until the end of their term in office. The pension module for a cal-
endar year is calculated by converting the relevant annual contri-
bution into an entitlement to a retirement, disability and surviving
dependants’ pension. The pension account represents the pension
entitlement the Board member has accrued for an annual retire-
ment pension. Since 2015, increases in the fixed annual salary on-
ly increase the pension module if so resolved by the Supervisory
Board.

Company pension entitlements acquired under the old compa-
ny pension scheme for members of the Board of Managing Direc-
tors before the transition to the new system have been transferred
to this new system as an initial module. The initial module is ad-

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

justed in accordance with the pension agreement, as the old sys-
tem provided for a benefit based on final salary.

Members of the Board of Managing Directors receive a retire-
ment benefit in the form of a life-long pension, subject to the fol-
lowing conditions, provided their employment has ended:

e an old-age pension if the Board member has reached age 65;

ean early retirement pension if (i) the Board member has
reached age 62 but not age 65 or (ii) the Board member has
served at least 10 years on the Board of Managing Directors
and has reached age 58, or (iii) the Board member has served
at least 15 years on the Board of Managing Directors; or

° adisability pension if the Board member is permanently unable
to work.

If a member of the Board of Managing Directors leaves the
Bank before the pension benefits become due, any entitlement to
vested benefits that they have already accrued is retained.

The monthly amount of the retirement pension is calculated as
a twelfth of the amount in the pension account when the pension
benefits start.

When calculating the early retirement pension, the pension
will be reduced to reflect the fact that the payments start earlier.

If pension is paid due to disability before the age of 55, a sup-
plement is added to the monthly disability pension.

If retiring upon reaching the age of 62, members of the Board
of Managing Directors can elect to receive one lump-sum payment
or nine annual instalments instead of an ongoing pension. The
amount paid out is calculated using a capitalisation rate based on
the age of the Board member.

Members of the Board of Managing Directors who leave the
Board at age 62 or older or are permanently unable to work will
continue to receive their pro-rata basic salary for six months as a
form of transitional pay instead of the pension. The transitional
pay can be reduced, especially in the event of misconduct. If a
member of the Board of Managing Directors draws an early re-
tirement pension and has not yet reached age 62, income earned
from other activities will be deducted from the pension entitlement
at arate of 50% until age 62 is reached.

The surviving dependants’ pension for a surviving spouse or
partner is 66 2/3% of the Board member's pension entitlements. If

no surviving dependant’s pension is paid to a surviving spouse or
partner, minors or children still in full-time education are entitled
to an orphan’s pension of 25% each of the Board member's pen-
sion entitlement, the total of the orphan’s pensions being limited,
however, to a maximum of the pension that would otherwise have
been paid to a survi

ing spouse or partner.

Rules for Board members appointed after the new provisions in
place Pension provision for members of the Board of Managing
Directors appointed after the new provisions came into effect was
defined according to the Commerzbank capital plan for company
pension benefits. Members of the Board of Managing Directors
receive a retirement benefit in the form of a capital payment, sub-
ject to the following conditions, provided their employment has
ended:

° they have reached age 65 (retirement capital) or

° they have reached age 62 but not yet age 65 (early retirement
capital) or

«they are permanently unable to work before they reach age 62.

If a member of the Board of Managing Directors leaves the
Bank before the pension benefits become due, any entitlement to
vested benefits that the Board member has already accrued is re-
tained.

For each calendar year during the employment relationship un-
til pension benefits start to be paid out, each member of the Board
of Managing Directors joining after the new rules came into effect
is credited an annual module equating to 40% of the fixed basic
annual salary contribution), multiplied by an age-
dependent conversion factor. Under this system, too, increases in
the fixed annual salary since 2015 only increase the annual mod-
ule if so resolved by the Supervisory Board. The annual modules
are managed in a pension account until the member of the Board
of Managing Directors in question no longer serves on the Board.
Upon reaching age 61, a premium of 2.5% of the amount in the
Board member's pension account at the end of the previous year is
additionally credited to the member's pension account until the
pension benefits start to be paid out.

(annual

The annual contribution is invested in investment funds and
placed in a virtual custody account.

The retirement capital (or early retirement capital, as the case
may be) corresponds to the amount in the virtual custody account

or the amount in the pension account, whichever is higher when
the pension benefits become payable. Under these rules, the
amount in the pension account represents the minimum capital
sum payable, insofar as the amount in the virtual custody account
is lower. As an alternative to a lump-sum payment, the member of
the Board member in question may elect to receive a life-long
pension.

For the first two months after pension benefits become due, the
Board member in question will receive transitional pay of one-
twelfth of their fixed basic annual salary per month. The transi-
tional pay may be reduced, especially in the event of misconduct.

If a member of the Board of Managing Directors dies before the
pension benefits become due, his/her dependants are entitled to
receive dependants’ capital, which is the amount in the virtual cus-
tody account on the value date or the amount in the pension ac-
count plus any applicable supplement, whichever is higher. A sup-
plement is payable if, at the time pension benefits become due
because of inability to work or death, the Board member had
served at least five consecutive years on the Bank’s Board of Man-
aging Directors and had not yet reached age 55. If a Board mem-
ber selected the option of drawing a retirement pension, in the
event of that Board member's death, as a prospective pension re-
cipient, the surviving spouse or partner will receive a surviving
dependant’s pension calculated on the basis of the retirement cap-
ital applying actuarial rules. If the Board member in question was
already drawing a pension, a surviving spouse or partner will re-
ceive a surviving dependant’s pension of 60% of the amount of
the pension last paid to the deceased Board member.

The table below shows the annual pension entitlements on
31 December 2018 at a pensionable age of 62 for active members
of the Board of Managing Directors, the corresponding actuarial
net present values on 31 December 2018, the interest-rate-
adjusted changes to the settlement amounts for 2018, and the

" The impact of the new Heubeck mortality tables varied because, in addition to life expectancy, disability risk is an important parameter,

and this has a differing effect depending on age.

? For Martin Zielke, Frank Annuscheit and Michael Reuther, the fall in the discount rate from 3.68% to 3.21% has a greater impact
on the respective net present values of the pension entitlements accrued because they come under the old pension scheme.

* Capital payment annualised.

* Dr. Bettina Orlopp has been a member of the Board of Managing Directors since 1 November 2017.

The assets backing these pension obligations have been trans-
ferred under a contractual trust arrangement to Commerzbank
Pension-Trust e.V.

As at 31 December 2018, pension obligations for current mem-
bers of the Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft Board of Managing
Directors in financial year 2018 totalled €20.4m (previous year:
€16.0m).

Rules applying to the termination of office
If the term of office of a member of the Board of Managing Direc-
tors is effectively terminated, the following applies:

If the term of office of a member of the Board of Managing Di-
rectors ends prematurely, the employment contract normally ex-
pires six months later (linking clause). In this case, the Board
member continues to receive the basic annual salary and variable
remuneration — subject to Art. 615 sentence 2 of the German Civil
Code (crediting of remuneration otherwise acquired) — beyond the
end of employment until the end of the original term of office.
From the time the term of office is ended, target achievement is
the average target achievement of the other members of the Board
of Managing Directors for the year in question. The variable re-
muneration otherwise remains subject to the rules of the remuner-
ation system, including retrospective performance evaluation.

If, in the case of premature termination of the term of office,
the employment contract ends for reasons other than the linking
clause described above, the fixed basic annual salary will continue

to be paid — pro rata temporis where applicable - until the end of
the employment contract. The variable remuneration communicat-
ed for financial years prior to the termination of the employment
contract remains unaffected. The variable remuneration for the
year in which the term of office ends is reduced pro rata temporis
where applicable. In this case, too, the variable remuneration re-
mains subject to the rules of the remuneration system, including
retrospective performance evaluation.

If the employment contract is not extended upon expiry of the
respective term of office, without there being good cause within
the meaning of Art. 626 of the German Civil Code, or if the em-
ployment contract ends as a result of a linking clause as described
above, the Board member will continue to receive his or her basic
annual salary for a maximum period of six months beyond the end
of the original term of office. This payment ceases as soon as the
Board member starts receiving pension payments.

In all these cases, the specified payments for the time after the
effective termination of the term of office may not exceed two
years’ annual remuneration (cap)'.

If upon termination of a term of office or non-extension of an
appointment, the conditions apply for extraordinary termination of
the employment contract pursuant to Art. 626 of the German Civil
Code, the Board member in question will receive no variable re-
muneration for the calendar year in which their term of office
ends. The same applies where a member of the Board of Manag-
ing Directors resigns without good cause attributable to the Bank.

" The cap is twice the basic annual salary including fringe benefits (in particular, the use of a company car with driver, security measures,

insurance premiums for accident insurance and the applicable tax thereon) plus the average variable compensation granted for the three

financial years previous to termination of the term of office.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

In both these cases, the same applies to the fixed basic annual sal-
ary from the end of the month in which the term of office ends. If
the term of office is terminated because of a serious breach of du-
ty, the variable remuneration for the year in which the term of of-
fice ended and variable remuneration not yet paid out in respect of
previous years shall not be payable.

Termination agreement with a member of the Board of
Managing Directors

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft concluded a termination agree-
ment with Frank Annuscheit on 5 December 2018, under which
Mr. Annuscheit’s term of office as a member of the Board of Man-
aging Directors ended at the close of 28 February 2019. Mr. An-
nuscheit is entitled to all contractual claims for the period up to
the end of the original term of office on 31 December 2020 (origi-
nal termination date). In particular, he is entitled to the contractual
remuneration claims limited by the cap described above. The cap
is not calculated on the basis of the increased fixed basic annual
salary as of 1 January 2019, but on the basis of the previous fixed
basic annual salary of €750 thousand. Mr. Annuscheit will contin-
ue to receive contributions to the company pension scheme under
his pension agreement until the original termination date. The
contributions will likewise be calculated on the basis of the fixed
basic annual salary of €750 thousand. Mr. Annuscheit is entitled to
fringe benefits in accordance with the employment contract, inso-
far as the contract stipulates them as also being applicable to the
period following the end of the term of office. The value of the
fringe benefits will be deducted from the cap. The cap is €2,888
thousand.

Other

No members of the Board of Managing Directors received pay-
ments or promises of payment from third parties in the year under
review in respect of their work as a member of the Board of Man-
aging Directors.

Details of remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors in
accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code
Under 4.2.5 the German Corporate Governance Code in the ver-
sion dated 7 February 2017, the remuneration awarded for the
year under review and the allocation (actual payouts) for the year
under review are to be reported for each member of the Board of

Managing Directors. This is to be broken down into fixed remu-

neration, company fringe benefits and one-year and multi-year
variable remuneration.

As the model tables recommended by the German Corporate
Governance Code do not take account of the specificities of the
Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions, and hence are less suita-
ble for institutions such as Commerzbank, the Bank has designed
its own tables, which provide transparent and comprehensible in-
formation on its remuneration system for members of the Board of
Managing Directors. Commerzbank has decided not to include the
Code’s model tables alongside the tables it designed itself, be-
cause this would undermine the clarity and comprehensibility of
the remuneration report. Commerzbank also stated this in its dec-
laration of compliance pursuant to Art. 161 of the Stock Corpora-
tion Act. As in the previous year, the remuneration awards table
and the allocation table below do not distinguish between one-
year and multi-year variable remuneration, but instead between
short-term and long-term remuneration. This is because the total
variable remuneration regularly includes the achievement of com-
pany targets over a period of three years. The only exceptions to
this stem from a transitional arrangement for newly appointed
members of the Board of Managing Directors in the first and sec-
ond years of their appointment.

Variable short-term remuneration is the Short-Term Incentive
under the remuneration system. This is paid out half in cash after
the end of the financial year and half in the form of shares after a
12-month waiting period, i.e. in the short term. Entitlement to the
long-term portion, the Long-Term Incentive, arises only after a
five-year retention period and is subject to a retrospective perfor-
mance evaluation. The pension expense for pension provision for
the individual members of the Board of Managing Directors is
shown in the above table in the “Interest rate-adjusted changes to
settlement amounts” column. Pension expense is therefore not
shown again in either the remuneration allocations or the remu-
neration awards table.

The following tables show the actual allocations in 2018 with
the figures from the previous year for comparison for each indi-
vidual member of the Board of Managing Directors. The allocation
“for” the year means that the STI 2018 paid in cash for 2018 and
for which all inputs are available at the end of the year is shown as
an allocation for 2018 even though the actual payout is not made
until 2019. Hence, the STI 2017 paid out in cash in 2018 is shown
as an allocation for 2017.

The following table shows the remuneration awarded, which com-
pri ic salary and fringe benefits) and
variable remuneration at the target amount set, the short-term and

es fixed remuneration (ba

long-term portions of variable remuneration and the minimum and
maximum amounts of total variable remuneration for each individ-
ual member of the Board of Managing Directors.

Unlike the model table of the German Corporate Governance
Code for remuneration awarded, the variable remuneration allo-
cated is not shown as the target amount, i.e. the amount if target
achievement is 100% or a comparable figure for an average prob-
ability scenario. Instead, the total target achievement amounts de-
termined by the Supervisory Board are shown for each member of
the Board of Managing Directors. The table reflects the actual tar-
get achievement of the members of the Board of Managing Direc-
tors and is therefore of greater informational value in respect of
the variable remuneration for the past financial year than a hypo-
thetical value that assumes target achievement of 100%.

Of the total target achievement amount and the minimum and
maximum values shown, 40% relate to short-term variable remu-
neration (STI). Of the total target achievement amount and the
minimum and maximum values shown, 60% relates to long-term
variable remuneration (LT). In both cases, half of the remunera-
tion is share-based.

At its meeting on 13 February 2019, the Supervisory Board set
the total target achievement amounts for variable remuneration of
the individual members of the Board of Managing Directors for
2018. The total target achievement amount is not necessarily the
same as the amount that may later actually be paid out. For in-
stance, the Supervisory Board may reduce the portion relating to
the LTI during the retrospective performance evaluation if hind-
sight indicates that this was not originally calibrated correctly. Al-
so, half of the

riable remuneration is share-based. Any changes
in the Commerzbank share price compared to the conversion price
therefore result in changes in the amounts paid out.

Details of remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors
pursuant to German Accounting Standard no. 17 (DRS 17)

The remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors is shown
below in accordance with the rules of DRS 17. The amounts shown
differ from those reported above based on the German Corporate
Governance Code. This is because reporting under DRS 17 in-
volves special rules. The main differences that lead to different
figures are:

Under DRS 17, the LTI components of the remuneration system
may only be stated after the retrospective performance assess-
ment has been completed and the five-year retention period
has expired. They are therefore not included in the DRS 17 ta-
ble, in contrast to the remuneration awards table, which is
based on the rules of the German Corporate Governance Code.

e The value of the share-based STI components has to be shown
in the DRS 17 table using the share price on the day the Super-
visory Board determined the total target achievement amounts.
Therefore, the performance of the Commerzbank share from
the start of the year to the day the amount was determined is
included in the value shown. In contrast, in the remuneration
awards table, which is based on the German Corporate Govern-

ance Code, this component is shown at 20% of the total target
achievement amount. This is the value before conversion into a
quantity of virtual shares and, thus, it does not include share
price performance; therefore, the figure is generally different.

Consequently, total remuneration under DRS 17 cannot be
compared with the remuneration awarded shown in the table
based on the German Corporate Governance Code. The disclosure
does not reflect variable remuneration set by the Supervisory
Board for the year under review, nor is it an amount paid out. The
disclosure is, however, required for accounting reasons.

Under DRS 17, payments only have to be disclosed if they have
been granted on a legally binding basis. For both the cash compo-
nents and the share-based components of the LTI under the remu-
neration system this is only the case once the retrospective per-
formance evaluation has been carried out and the five-year
retention period has expired. The retrospective performance eval-
uation for the LTI in respect of 2018 will thus not be carried out by
the Supervisory Board until the end of 2023. The cash components
and share-based components of the LTI under the remuneration
system are therefore not included in the table.


--- Page 13 ---

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

However, for the purposes of DRS 17, the STI components are
deemed to be granted when they are determined by the Supervi-
sory Board following the end of the financial year in question. The
cash component of the STI is shown at 20% of the total target
achievement amount. This corresponds to the payout sum. The
share-based STI component is linked to the performance of the
Commerzbank share. Under DRS 17, share-based payments have
to be disclosed at the time the grant becomes legally binding, i.e.
when they are determined by the Supervisory Board. As payout of
the share-based STI components only takes place after the 12-

month waiting period has expired and is dependent on the per-
formance of the Commerzbank share, the table shows only theo-
retical values for these components, not the sums to be paid out.
The payout sums are calculated by multiplying the number of STI
virtual shares shown by the conversion price at the end of the
waiting period.

Under the remuneration system, no actual shares are awarded;
instead, a cash payment is made on the be

The performance-related components with long-term incentive effect are only granted once the Supervisory Board has completed the

retrospective performance evaluation after expiry of the five-year retention period. For 2018, that will be in 2024.

The amounts disclosed as total remuneration in accordance with DRS 17 for the 2018 financial year include only those components in respect

of which the members of the Board of Managing Directors already have a legally binding entitlement. As such, the amounts disclosed as total remuneration
in accordance with DRS 17 do not include the LT! components for financial year 2018, as there is no such entitlement until after the retrospective performance

evaluation and expiry of the five-year retention period

are shown under fringe benefits.
* Payable in 2019 following determination of the total target achievement amount for 2018.

Non-monetary remuneration awarded, tax due on non-monetary remuneration and employer contributions to the BVV occupational retirement fund

Payable one year after payment of the STI in cash. The amounts shown represent the values at the time that the variable remuneration was

determined in February 2019. The payout is dependent on the future performance of the Commerzbank share price. The number of virtual shares is
calculated using the proportion of the total target achievement amount and the average Commerzbank share price during November and December 2018.

Under DRS 17, the LT! EVA cash component still due for 2014 after the end of the four-year period from 2014 to 2017 and approval of the annual

financial statements for 2017 has to be reported for the previous year. The cash element of the 2014 LT! share components and the share elements
of both of these LT! components were already disclosed in the Annual Report 2014 and, therefore, do not need to be reported again under DRS 17.

Loans to members of the Board of Managing Directors
Members of the Board of Managing Directors have been granted
loans with terms ranging from on demand up to a due date of
2051 and at interest rates ranging between 0.7% and 2.8% and,
in certain cases, up to 9.5% on amounts overdrawn. The loans,
mainly real estate financing, are secured at normal market terms,
if necessary through land charges or rights of lien.

As at the reporting date, the aggregate amount of loans granted
to members of the Board of Managing Directors was €3,494 thou-
sand; in the previous year, the figure was €3,129 thousand. In
2018, members of the Board of Managing Directors repaid €308
thousand. With the exception of rental guarantees, Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft did not enter into any contingent liabilities in
favour of members of the Board of Managing Directors in the year
under review.

Amendment of the remuneration system of the Board of
Managing Directors as at 1 January 2019

On 7 November 2018, the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft amended the remuneration system. It did this in
order to meet the requirements set out in the revised version of
the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions of 4 August 2017. It
also decided to convert some of the variable remuneration compo-
nents into fixed remuneration components. The changes entered
into force on 1 January 2019 and have been contractually agreed
with all members of the Board of Managing Directors. The follow-
ing aspects are particularly noteworthy:

e The remuneration system contains a clawback provision, which
stipulates that variable remuneration already paid out can be
reclaimed for a period of up to seven years from the date of
payment and variable remuneration not yet paid out may be
voided. The provision takes effect in the circumstances set out
in section 20 paragraph 6 in conjunction with Art. 18 (5) sen-
tence 3 nos. 1 and 2 of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institu-
tions. This provision enters into force, for example, in the event
of a member of the Board of Managing Directors committing a
serious breach of duty or being responsible for substantial
losses.

e All of the regulatory parameters required to determine whether
a total amount of variable remuneration may be made available
are subject to an overall assessment.

e In the case of newly appointed members of the Board of Man-
aging Directors, the retention period will in future be extended
by two years to seven years for the first year of appointment
and by one year to six years for the second year of appoint-
ment.

e The retrospective performance evaluation for the LTI will no
longer be based on defined criteria with materiality thresholds,
but on a full review of the original decision on the determina-
tion of the variable remuneration.

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

° Dividend payments distributed during the retention period will
no longer be offset by the virtual shares granted.

Furthermore, the Supervisory Board has decided that some of
the variable remuneration components will be converted into fixed
remuneration components. The Supervisory Board increased the
fixed basic annual salary of the ordinary members of the Board of
Managing Directors from €750 thousand to €990 thousand and
reduced the target amount for variable remuneration from €1 mil-
lion to €660 thousand. The total target remuneration (fixed basic
annual salary and target amount for variable remuneration) is thus
€100 thousand lower than the previous amount. The fixed basic
annual salary of the Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors
was increased from €1,312,500 to €1,674,247 and the target
amount of variable remuneration was reduced from €1,628,640 to
€1,116,165. The total target remuneration of the Chairman of the
Board of Managing Directors is thus €150,728 lower than the pre-

vious figure.

Supervisory Board

Principles of the remuneration system and remuneration for
financial year 2018

The remuneration of the Supervisory Board is regulated in Art. 15
of the Articles of Association; the current version was approved by
the AGM on 20 April 2016.

Under the remuneration system, members of the Supervisory
Board receive basic remuneration of €80 thousand for each finan-
cial year. The Chairman receives triple and the Deputy Chairman
double this amount.

Members also receive an additional €30 thousand annually for
sitting on either the Audit Committee or the Risk Committee.
Members also receive an additional €20 thousand annually for
sitting on any other committee of the Supervisory Board that
meets at least once in the calendar year. The committee chairman
receives double these amounts. Additional remuneration is paid
for a maximum of three committee appointments; if more than
three committee appointments are held, the additional remunera-
tion is paid for the three highest paid positions. Members of the
Supervisory Board who only belonged to the Board or one of its
committees for part of a financial year receive reduced remunera-
tion for that year calculated pro rata temporis. In addition, each
member of the Supervisory Board receives an attendance fee of
€1.5 thousand for each meeting or conference call of the Supervi-
sory Board or one of its committees. Where several meetings or
conference calls take place on a single day, only one attendance
fee is paid. The basic remuneration, remuneration for serving on
committees and attendance fees are payable at the end of the fi-
nancial year.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft reimburses any expenses in-
curred by members of the Supervisory Board in the performance
of their duties and any VAT due on remuneration or expenses. The
Chairman of the Supervisory Board is provided with appropriate
human and material resources and, in particular, is reimbursed for
costs incurred for travel in connection with duties of representa-
tion and costs for requisite security measures arising from his po-
sition.

Members of the Supervisory Board thus received total net re-
muneration for the 2018 financial year of €3,174.0 thousand (pre-
vious year: €2,936.3 thousand). Of this figure, the basic remunera-
tion amounted to €1,842.2 thousand (previous year: €1839.8
thousand) and remuneration for committee memberships to
€910.3 thousand (previous year: €765.0 thousand). Attendance
fees were €421.5 thousand (previous year: €331.5 thousand).

The remuneration is divided between the individual members
of the Supervisory Board as follows:

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Members of the Supervisory Board once again provided no adviso-
ry, intermediary or other personal services in 2018. Accordingly,
no additional remuneration was paid.

Loans to members of the Supervisory Board

Members of the Supervisory Board have been granted loans with
terms ranging from on demand up to a due date of 2042 and at
interest rates ranging between 1.0% and 4.7%, and on amounts
overdrawn in certain cases up to 9.5%. The loans, mainly real es-
tate financing, are secured at normal market terms, if necessary
through land charges or rights of lien.

As at the reporting date, the aggregate amount of loans granted
to members of the Supervisory Board was €1,578 thousand; in the
previous year, the figure was €3,560 thousand). Repayments of
€34 thousand were made in 2018. This further decline in loans
was mainly due to changes in the members serving on the Super-
visory Board. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft did not enter into
any contingent liabilities in favour of members of the Supervisory
Board in the year under review.

Other details

D&O liability insurance

A Directors and Officers (D&O) liability insurance policy is in place
for members of the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervi-
sory Board. The excess for members of the Supervisory Board and
the Board of Managing Directors is set at 10% of the claim up to a
maximum of 150% of the fixed annual remuneration for all insur-

ance claims made within a single year.

Purchase and sale of
Bank shares
Art. 19 of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on market abuse requires
disclosure and notification of transactions by managers of listed
companies and persons closely associated with them. Own trans-
actions by such persons in shares or bonds issued by Commerz-
bank Aktiengesellschaft or in derivatives or other financial instru-
ments based thereon must be disclosed if they exceed an
aggregate volume of €5 thousand within a calendar year. This duty
of disclosure applies to members of the Board of Managing Direc-
tors and the Supervisory Board.

pursuant to Art. 289a (1) of the German
Commercial Code (HGB) and explanatory report

Share capital structure

The share capital of Commerzbank totalled €1,252,357,634.00 at
the end of the financial year. It is divided into 1,252,357,634 no-
par-value shares. The shares are issued in bearer form. Commerz-
bank has issued only ordinary shares with the same rights and re-
sponsibilities. Each share has one vote.

Restrictions on voting rights and transfers; nature of voting
control for employee shares

We are not aware of any restrictions on voting rights or the trans-
fer of shares. Employees who hold Commerzbank shares exercise
their rights of control like any other shareholders, in accordance
with the law and the Articles of Association.

Shares with special rights granting powers of control
There are no shares with special rights granting powers of control.

Appointment and replacement of the members of the Board of

Managing Directors; amendments to the Articles of Association
The members of the Board of Managing Directors are appointed
and replaced by the Supervisory Board pursuant to Art. 84 of the
German Stock Corporation Act and Art. 6 (2) of the Articles of As-
sociation. Before members of the Board of Managing Directors are
appointed it must be demonstrated to BaFin, the Deutsche Bun-
desbank and the ECB that they are fit and proper and have suffi-
cient time available. Being fit and proper requires them to have
sufficient theoretical and practical knowledge of the Bank’s busi-
ness and management experience (Section 24 (1) no. 1 and Sec-
tion 25c (1) of the German Banking Act (KWG) and Art. 93 Regula-
tion (EU) No. 468/2014 (the SSM Framework Regulation).
Pursuant to Art. 6 (1) of the Articles of Association, the Board of
Managing Directors must comprise a minimum of two people;
otherwise, the Supervisory Board defines the number of members
on the Board of Managing Directors in accordance with Art. 6 (2)
of the Articles of Association. If there is a vacancy on the Board of
Managing Directors for a required member and the Supervisory
Board has not appointed a replacement, in urgent cases one will
be appointed by a court pursuant to Art. 85 of the German Stock
Corporation Act. Any amendment to the Articles of Association
requires a resolution of the Annual General Meeting under Art.
179 (1) sentence 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. Unless
the law mandates a majority of the share capital represented at the

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

date of resolution, a simple majority of the capital represented is
sufficient to pass resolutions (Art. 19 (3) sentence 2 of the Articles
of Association). The authority to amend the Articles of Association,
provided such amendments affect merely the wording of an article
with no change in substance, has been transferred to the Supervi-
sory Board under Art. 10 (3) of the Articles of Association in com-
pliance with Art. 179 (1) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corpora-
tion Act.

Powers of the Board of Managing Directors to issue and buy
back shares

The Board of Managing Directors, with the approval of the Super-
visory Board, is authorised to increase the share capital by a total
of €569,253,470.00 by issuing new shares under Art. 4 (3) (Au-
thorised Capital 2015) of the Articles of Association applicable on
31 December 2018. The Board of Managing Directors is author-
ised to exclude subscription rights in certain circumstances, with
the approval of the Supervisory Board.

Moreover, the Annual General Meeting on 30 April 2015 gave
the Board of Managing Directors the authority to issue convertible
bonds or bonds with warrants, profit-sharing certificates or hybrid
debt instruments (both with and without conversion or option
rights or mandatory conversion) against a cash or non-cash con-
tribution for a total nominal value of up to €13,600,000,000.00.
The financial instruments can also be structured in such a way that
they are recognised as Additional Tier 1 capital at the time of is-
sue. However, the Board of Managing Directors is authorised to
exclude subscription rights to financial instruments in certain cir-
cumstances, with the approval of the Supervisory Board. Condi-
tional capital of up to €569,253,470.00 is available to issue finan-
cial instruments with conversion or option rights or obligations
under Art. 4 (4) of the Articles of Association (Conditional Capital
2015).

For details of the authorised capital and conditional capital,
particularly regarding maturities and terms and conditions of ex-
ercise, please refer to the explanations in Notes 30 and 31.

On 30 April 2015, the Annual General Meeting authorised the
Board of Managing Directors to purchase and sell
shares for the purpose of securities trading, pursuant to Art. 71 (1)
no. 7 of the German Stock Corporation Act, until 29 April 2020. The
aggregate amount of shares to be acquired for this purpose may
not exceed 5% of the share capital of Commerzbank Aktiengesell-
schaft at the end of any given day. The price at which own shares
are purchased may not be more than 10% lower or higher than the

Commerzbank

average share price (closing auction prices or similar successor
prices for Commerzbank shares in Xetra trading or a similar suc-
cessor system to the Xetra system on the Frankfurt Stock Ex-
change) on the three trading days preceding the purchase.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Material agreements in the event of a change of control
following a takeover bid

In the event of a change of control at Commerzbank, an extraordi-
nary right of termination in favour of certain contract parties has
been negotiated by Commerzbank under ISDA master agreements.
In general, the right of termination is also conditional upon a ma-
terial deterioration in Commerzbank’s credit standing. In the event
of this type of termination, the individual agreements signed under
these master agreements would have to be settled at market value,
which can be determined on any stock exchange trading day.
However, the possibility cannot be excluded that, if an individual
customer with an especially large volume of business terminates a
contract, Commerzbank’s net assets, financial position and operat-
ing results could nevertheless be heavily impacted due to the
Bank’s potential payment obligations.

Compensation agreements in the event of a takeover offer
There are no compensation agreements in the event of a takeover
offer, either with the members of the Board of Managing Directors
or with employees of Commerzbank.

Equity holdings that exceed 10% of the voting rights

According to the notification of voting rights dated 4 June 2013,
the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund holds a stake of 17.15% in
the voting capital of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. Provided
that the voting rights are unchanged, the Financial Market Stabili-
sation Fund would hold a stake of approximately 15.6% in the vot-
ing capital of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft following the capi-
tal increase in April 2015.

Details pursuant to Art. 289 (4) of the German
Commercial Code (HGB)

The aim of the internal control and risk management system in
respect of financial reporting is to ensure that the annual financial
statements of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and the Commerz-
bank Group provide a true and fair view of the net assets, financial
position and results of operations in accordance with the applica-
ble accounting standards under the German Commercial Code and
IFRS. The internal control system and the risk management sys-
tem at Commerzbank are linked with each other, both with a view
to financial reporting. In the following, we shall therefore use the
term ICS (internal control system). Details of the risk management
system can be found in the risk report on pages 44 ff.

The objective of proper and reliable financial reporting is en-
dangered if material information in the financial reporting is erro-
neous. It is irrelevant whether this is due to one single matter or a
combination of several.

Risks to financial reporting may arise from errors in the ac-
counting processes. Fraudulent behaviour can also result in the
inaccurate reporting of information. The Bank therefore has to en-
sure it minimises the risks of incorrect statement, measurement or
presentation of material information in the financial reporting.

The Commerzbank ICS seeks to provide sufficient certainty that
it complies with the relevant legal requirements, that business is
conducted in a proper and cost-effective manner and that financial
reporting is complete and accurate. It is important to note that de-
spite all measures the Bank may take, the ICS methods and proce-
dures used cannot entirely rule out accidental errors or fraud and,
as such, offer sufficient certainty but never absolute certainty.

Legal basis and guidelines

Art. 289 (4) of the German Commercial Code requires capital mar-
ket-oriented companies to describe the material features of their
ICS in the management report. Commerzbank follows the princi-
ples for bank-specific organisation of the internal control system
set out in the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management
(MaRisk).

The Bank’s internal control system is structured in line with the
internationally recognised framework developed by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Commerzbank derives the following objectives from this:

© that business processes be effective and efficient,
«that applicable laws and regulations be observed and
«that financial reporting be reliable.

As regards the risk assessment of the reporting process
required by COSO in respect of the reliability of financial report-
ing (for example, ensuring that all transactions are fully and cor-
rectly recognised in the financial statements), the Bank follows
the recommendations of the International Standard on Auditing
(ISA) 315.

Organisation

The written rules of procedure form a sound basis for good corpo-
rate governance that provides strategic direction for the Group as
a whole while taking account of risk elements. These rules are de-
fined as the transparent description, to be updated on an ongoing
basis, of the organisational structure and processes of a company,
including powers. The binding standard required by regulation for
the organisational structure is set down in the policy on written
rules and procedure and the process framework. These form the
basis for process descriptions and other directives. Documenting
and updating the organisational structure is seen as part of the
written rules and procedures and sets consistent and binding min-
imum requirements as a governance framework for all corporate
units. The primary feature is the principle of clear allocation of
responsibility, starting with the schedule of business responsibili-


--- Page 20 ---

ties for the full Board of Managing Directors and ending with the
individual cost approval authorities at the lower management lev-
els. The scope and structure of the governance framework follow
both the legal and regulatory requirements and also the
“Commerzbank corporate constitution” approved by the full Board
of Managing Directors. The governance framework translates the
main guiding principles of the corporate constitution into practical
rules and comprises the following elements:

e plan for allocating the business responsibilities for the full
Board of Managing Directors,

e rules of procedure,

© organisational charts,

© business remits of the units and

© approval authorities for operating costs.

The organisational control and monitoring units that ensure a
functioning and efficient control structure are aligned in three
successive levels at Commerzbank AG. The “three lines of de-
fence” model is a central element in Commerzbank’s corporate
constitution. In addition, where tasks in the Bank by their nature
cannot be combined, they are organised into different areas apply-
ing the principle of separation of functions. Strict checks are also
carried out using the dual-control principle to minimise risks in
financial reporting.

In accordance with MaRisk, responsibility for implementing,
executing, applying, refining and reviewing the Bank-wide IC!
with the full Board of Managing Directors. The full Board of Man-
aging Directors is responsible for structuring the Group-wide ICS
and demonstrating that it is appropriate, while the CFO is respon-
sible for structuring the ICS for financial reporting and ensuring
its effectiveness for this purpose. The CFO is responsible for the
design of the ICS through appropriate and effective control steps

lies

and for embedding these into the various processes. The full
Board of Managing Directors is also responsible for ensuring that
the financial statements for the parent company and Group are
properly prepared.

The Supervisory Board is supported in its oversight of the fi-
nancial reporting primarily by the Audit Committee set up for this
purpose. It provides support in monitoring the accounting process
and the effectiveness of the risk management system (especially
the internal control system), compliance and internal audit. It also
provides support in monitoring the performance of the annual au-
dit, particularly with regard to the independence of the auditor and
the services provided by the auditor. The Audit Committee also
monitors remediation of shortcomings noted by the auditor within
the scope of the follow-up and reporting done by Internal Audit.

During the year, Group Audit reports to the Supervisory Board
and its appointed committees about the work it has carried out
and its material findings.

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

Group Finance (GM-F), which reports directly to the CFO, is re-
sponsible for ensuring that the financial statements are drawn up
in compliance with the relevant laws and internal and external
guidelines.

Within GM-F, Accounting and Controlling Policies & Guidelines
is the department responsible for drawing up accounting guide-
lines and publishing them over the intranet. Implementation of
these accounting guidelines supports consistent and correct re-
porting across the Group.

GM-F is supported in producing financial statements by other
Group divisions. Of particular importance here is Group Infor-
mation Technology, which is responsible for providing and up-
grading the accounting IT systems used.

Controls to minimise risk

Controls at the Bank are integrated directly into operating pro-
cesses, either technically or manually (i.e. by means of organisa-
tion). Technical controls are used in the IT systems employed and
consist, for example, of check sums and verification digits. Tech-
nical controls are often complemented by manual controls such as
screen approvals carried out by the responsible employees. Data
quality on initial entry into systems is ensured by organisational
measures such as the dual-control principle, delegation of powers
of approval, the separation of functions and by technical measures
when issuing IT approval authorities. Additional controls during
further processing guarantee that the data entered and used is
complete and accurate.

Monitoring by Group Audit

Group Audit (GM-A) provides auditing and advisory services for
the Board of Managing Directors independently, objectively and in
a risk-oriented manner so as to evaluate the compliance, security
and cost-effectiveness of Commerzbank’s business processes and
flag potential for optimisation. GM-A supports the Board of Man-
aging Directors by evaluating the appropriateness and effective-
ness of risk management, the internal control system and business
processes in a systematic and targeted manner, providing support
on key projects in an internal auditing capacity and issuing rec-
ommendations. In doing so, it contributes to the security of busi-
ness processes and assets.

GM-A is directly accountable to the Board of Managing Direc-
tors and reports to that body. It performs its functions autono-
mously and independently. Particularly with regard to reporting
and the assessment of audit results, GM-A is not subject to any
directives. Based on MakRisk, its auditing activities, underpinned
by the principle of risk-oriented auditing, extend to all of the
Group's activities and processes, regardless of whether these take
place within the Group or are outsourced. GM-A’s activities com-
plement the work of the subsidiaries’ audit departments within the
framework of Group risk management. The audit of the suitability
and effectiveness of the ICS covers the risk management and risk

23

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

controlling systems, reporting, IT systems and financial reporting.
In performing its duties, GM-A has an unrestricted right to infor-
mation.

GM-A promptly prepares a written report on each audit; recipi-
ents include the responsible members of the Board of Managing
Directors. On the basis of these audit reports, GM-A oversees and
documents the steps taken to remedy any deficiencies identified
within the period of time specified for this. If such deficiencies are
ignored, an escalation process comes into effect. In addition,
GM-A prepares an annual report on the audits that it has carried
out during the course of the financial year, the material deficien-
cies identified and the corrective measures taken, and presents
this report to the Board of Managing Directors.

The financial reporting process

The financial reporting procedures at Commerzbank are supported
by IT systems integrated into each process. The annual financial
statements of Commerzbank AG in Germany are produced using a
financial architecture consisting of a new financial data warehouse
that provides a consistent repository of basic information and
standard SAP software for the financial function. The parent com-
pany in Germany therefore has a single solution using consistent
financial data for financial statements under both IFRS and the
German Commercial Code.

As part of the input process for financial reporting, all infor-
mation relevant for drawing up the financial statements of
Commerzbank Group under IFRS and Commerzbank Aktiengesell-
schaft under the German Commercial Code is submitted to GM-F
by the reporting units. Data is transmitted via an online data entry
functionality directly into SAP EC-CS consolidation software,
which has been adapted to the Bank’s requirements. Subsidiaries
submit IFRS data; German and foreign branches also submit data
under the German Commercial Code. Data is automatically
checked for consistency before transmission to GM-F. Once the
plausibility checks have been successfully completed, the individ-
ual reports can be finalised. Further plausibility checks are carried
out using this data in GM-F. After these checks have been success-
fully completed, the Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft parent com-
pany financial statements are drawn up and all the necessary steps
are taken to produce the consolidated Commerzbank Group finan-
cial statements. Drawing up the Group financial statements in-
volves individual steps (e.g. consolidating equity, liabilities, in-
come and expenses), currency translation and the elimination of
intra-Group profits.

IFRS segment reporting is done on a separate IT system. This
involves reconciliation with the data from accounting.

Measures to further enhance the ICS as regards

financial reporting

The ICS has been adapted to meet the needs of the Commerzbank
Group as regards financial reporting and it is enhanced further on
an ongoing basis. To this end, Control Environment Finance (CEF)
has been permanently implemented at Group Finance. CEF is
based on the GM-F “process map”. This is a top-down representa-
tion of all key processes, which is refined with descriptions of pro-
cedures and in which the risks in relation to the reliability of finan-
cial reporting are determined, applying the COSO framework. The
Bank also follows the recommendations of ISA 315. This involves
checking whether a risk can be assigned to one of the following
three categories and their various aspects:

© statements on types of business transaction: their occurrence,
completeness, accuracy, allocation to the correct period and
the correct account;

© statements on account balances at the reporting date: availabil-
ity, rights and obligations, completeness, measurement and al-
location;

© statements on presentation in the financial statements and on
the notes to the financial statements: occurrence, rights and
obligations, completeness, reporting and comprehensibility,
accuracy and measurement.

Suitable controls are implemented to minimise the risks identi-
fied, and these in turn are also assigned to the ISA 315 categories
and their various aspects. With respect to the effectiveness of the
ICS, the way in which the controls are structured in the form of
appropriate steps and embedded into the respective processes and
the way the controls are performed at the operating level are deci-
sive factors in minimising risk.

The ICS is reinforced by regular assessment of the effective-
ness and efficiency of key controls and regular checks on how con-
trols are implemented in the interest of financial reporting.

This procedure ensures that risks are identified and minimised
and that any faulty developments on the operational side are
avoided.

Other
No material changes have been made to the financial reporting
ICS since the reporting date.

The details pursuant to Art. 340a (1a) in conjunction with Art.
289b (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) can be found

port of the Commerzbank Group on pages 48 ff. and online at:

Corporate governance report and declaration on
corporate governance pursuant to Art. 289f of
the German Commercial Code

Commerzbank has always attached great importance to responsi-
ble and transparent corporate governance aimed at sustainable
value creation. That is why we - the Board of Managing Directors
and the Supervisory Board — expressly support the German Corpo-
rate Governance Code and the goals and objectives it pursues.

In accordance with section 3.10 of the German Corporate Gov-
ernance Code, we report below on corporate governance as prac-
tised at Commerzbank. This report also includes the declaration on
corporate governance in accordance with Art. 289f of the German
Commercial Code.

Recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code
The Bank declares every year whether the recommendations of
the Commission regarding conduct have been and are being
complied with, and explains which individual recommendations
are not being implemented and the reasons why. This declaration
of compliance by the Board of Managing Directors and the Su-
pervisory Board is published on the Commerzbank website
(https://www.commerzbank.com). There is also an archive of all
the declarations of compliance made since 2002. The latest decla-
ration was made in November 2018.

Commerzbank complies with virtually all of the recommenda-
tions of the German Corporate Governance Code; it deviates from
them in only a few points:

e Section 4.2.1 of the Code recommends that rules of procedure
should be in place that govern the activities of the Board of
Managing Directors, including the allocation of responsibilities
to its members. The Board of Managing Directors has adopted
rules of procedure with the approval of the Supervisory Board.
However, the Board of Managing Directors determines the al-
location of duties among the individual Board members itself,
outside the purview of the rules of procedure. This provides it
with the requisite flexibility if changes are needed, thus ensur-
ing an efficient division of responsibilities within the Board of
Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board is informed of all

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

changes and is thus included in the process. The rules of pro-
cedure for the Board of Managing Directors and the specific
responsibilities of the various members of the Board of Man-
aging Directors are published on Commerzbank AG's website
at http:/Avww.commerzbank.com.

According to section 4.2.3 (2) sentence 6 of the Code, the total
remuneration of the members of the Board of Managing Direc-
tors and the upper limits on their variable remuneration com-
ponents should be disclosed. The core elements of the Bank’s
remuneration system are a fixed basic annual salary plus varia-
ble remuneration with a uniform target amount. In respect of
variable remuneration, after the end of a financial year, the Su-
pervisory Board determines an amount for total target
achievement based on previously agreed goals. This amount is
capped at 1.4x fixed remuneration as calculated under the Re-
muneration Ordinance for Institutions. Up to 50% of this
amount is paid in virtual Commerzbank shares, which are nor-
mally subject to a five-year retention period and a waiting peri-
od of a further 12 months. At the end of the waiting period, the
value of the virtual Commerzbank shares is paid out in cash,
subject to various checks to ensure sustainability. Changes in
the share price over this period do not affect the number of vir-
tual shares granted and thus will alter the amount to be paid
out, which has no upper limit. The remuneration system ist de-
signed such that the members of the Board of Managing Direc-
tors bear the risk of the performance of the virtual shares after
the calculation of the amount for total target achievement as an
element of long-term remuneration. It would not be appropriate
to cap the scope for participating in positive share price per-
formance, especially given that no floor applies if the price
should fall.

In accordance with section 4.2.3 (2) sentence 8 of the Code,
there should be no subsequent changes to targets or bench-
marks for determining the variable remuneration components
for the Board of Managing Directors. Under the German Stock
Corporation Act, however, the Supervisory Board should have
the option of restricting the variable remuneration of the Board
of Managing Directors in exceptional circumstances. It is enti-
tled under this legislation to adjust the targets and other pa-
rameters for determining variable remuneration components in
exceptional circumstances, to reasonably neutralise any posi-
tive or negative repercussions on the achievability of the tar-
gets; the cap on variable remuneration must be observed in all
cases.

Section 4.2.3 (3) of the Code recommends that in the case of
pension commitments to members of the Board of Managing
Directors, the Supervisory Board should define the intended
level of benefits — commensurate with the length of the term of

25


--- Page 23 ---

office — taking into account the resulting annual and long-term
expense for the company. Pension provision for the Board of
Managing Directors is a defined contribution scheme that does
not specify a particular level of benefits. Instead, each member
of the Board of Managing Directors has an entitlement to an
annual pension module, the amount of which is determined as
a percentage of that individual’s basic annual salary. This gives
the Supervisory Board a clear picture of the annual and long-
term expense for the company, including the impact of actuari-
al effects on pension provisions. The fact that the scheme does
not define a target benefit level, combined with the switch to a
defined contribution scheme, is in line with what is largely
standard business practice.

e Section 4.2.5 sentences 5 and 6 of the Code requires some of
the information on board remuneration in the remuneration re-
port to be provided in standardised tables. However, the model
tables recommended in the Code do not take account of the re-
quirements of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions and
are therefore not as suitable for financial institutions such as
Commerzbank AG. Commerzbank AG therefore deviated from
this recommendation in its remuneration report for 2017 and
does so again in the remuneration report for 2018. Com-
merzbank AG has created its own tables which provide clear
and transparent information on its board remuneration system.
Commerzbank AG has decided to present only the tables that it
created itself and those are required under accounting rules
and to omit the model tables recommended by the Code be-
cause the intended clarity and comprehensibility of the remu-
neration report would otherwise be undermined.

e Section 5.3.3 of the Code recommends that the Supervisory
Board establish a nomination committee made up exclusively
of share-holder representatives. Under Art. 25d (11) sentence 2
no. 1 of the German Banking Act, the nomination committee
must support the Supervisory Board in identifying candidates
to fill positions on bank management bodies. At Commerzbank,
this task was formerly performed by the Presiding Committee,
which also includes employee representatives. In order to
maintain the established practice at Commerzbank of involving
both employee and shareholder representatives in the selection
of candidates for the Board of Managing Directors, two mem-
bers of the Commerzbank Supervisory Board's Nomination
Committee are employee representatives.

Section 5.4.1 (2) sentence 2 of the Code recommends that the
Supervisory Board should set concrete objectives regarding its
composition which, while considering the specific situation at
the company, appropriately take into account the international
activities of the company, potential conflicts of interest, the
number of independent members of the Supervisory Board

pursuant to section 5.4.2 of the Code, a specified age limit for
members of the Supervisory Board, a specified limit on length
of service on the Supervisory Board and diversity. The Supervi-
sory Board of Commerzbank regularly sets specific targets for
its composition, appropriately taking into account the criteria
listed in section 5.4.1 (2) sentence 2. However, it had not yet
set a limit on the normal length of service on the Supervisory
Board, as the Supervisory Board takes the view that continued
service frequently has to be decided in respect of the individual
member. This is now reflected by means of a limit that allows
exceptions to be made for the Supervisory Board in justified
individual cases and gives priority to the provisions of the Co-
determination Act for employee representatives. This means
that the Code’s recommendation pursuant to section 5.4.1 (2)
sentence 2 is now and will be fully complied with.

Suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code
Commerzbank also largely complies with the suggestions of the
German Corporate Governance Code, deviating from them in only
a few points:

e In a departure from section 2.3.2, the proxy can only be
reached up to the day prior to the Annual General Meeting.
However, shareholders present or represented at the Annual
General Meeting are able to give instructions to the proxy at
the meeting itself as well.

e In section 2.3.3, it is suggested that shareholders be able to
watch the Annual General Meeting on the internet. Up to and
including financial year 2018, Commerzbank has broadcast
the speeches of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and
the Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors, but not the
general debate. This allowed shareholders to discuss matters
freely with the management, without a wide-scale public
broadcast. From financial year 2019 onwards, Commerzbank
will broadcast the Annual General Meeting in its entirety on
the internet for shareholders and thus fully comply with the
suggestion set out in section 2.3.3.

Company values and governance practices
at Commerzbank AG
Commerzbank is committed to its corporate, environmental and

social responsibilities. In order to ensure sustainable corporate
governance, extensive standards have been defined in various
spheres of activity, which are published on the Commerzbank

of conduct for acting with integrity, which provide all Commerz-

bank Group employees with a binding framework for lawful and
ethically appropriate conduct in the day-to-day working environ-
ment.

The Bank has also provided guidelines on corporate responsi-
bility to give guidance on the sustainable orientation of Commerz-
bank’s business activities. One of the six guidelines is the com-
mitment to the principles of the UN Global Compact, an initiative
set up by the United Nations together with many renowned com-
panies, which is dedicated to active environmental protection, re-
sponsible dealings with employees, respect for human rights and
the fight against corruption and bribery.

In its capacity as a key financier of the German economy,
Commerzbank has also defined various positions and guidelines
for its core business, including formulating environmental guide-
lines with a special focus on the environment. These guidelines
are important reference points for the orientation of the core busi-
ness as well as for managing the impacts on the environment.

Board of Managing Directors

The Commerzbank Board of Managing Directors is responsible for
independently managing the Bank in the Bank's best interest. In
doing so, it must consider the interests of shareholders, custom-
ers, employees and other stakeholders, with the objective of sus-
tainable value creation. It develops the company’s strategy, dis-
cusses it with the Supervisory Board and ensures _ its
implementation. In addition, it sees that efficient risk management
and risk control measures are in place. The Board of Managing
Directors conducts Commerzbank’s business activities in accord-
ance with the law, the Articles of Association, its rules of proce-
dure, internal guidelines and the relevant employment contracts. It
cooperates on a basis of trust with Commerzbank’s other corpo-
rate bodies and with employee representatives.

The composition of the Board of Managing Directors and the
responsibilities of its individual members are presented on page
5 of the Group Annual Report. The work of the Board of Manag-
ing Directors is specified in greater detail in its rules of proce-
dure, which may be

Supervisory Board

The Supervisory Board advises and supervises the Board of Man-
aging Directors in its management of the Bank. It appoints and
dismisses members of the Board of Managing Directors and, to-
gether with the Board of Managing Directors, ensures that there is
long-term succession planning. The Supervisory Board discharges

its responsibilities in accordance with legal requirements, the Arti-
cles of Association and its rules of procedure; it cooperates closely
and on a basis of trust with the Board of Managing Directors.

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

The composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees
is presented on pages 15 to 17 of the Group Annual Report. De-
tails of the work of this committee, its structure and its control
function can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board on
pages 6 to 14 of the Group Annual Report. Further details of how
the Supervisory Board and its committees work can be found in
the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, available online at
https://www.commerzbank.com.

Section 5.4.1 (2) of the Code recommends that the Supervisory
Board should set concrete objectives and draw up a profile of skills
and expertise for the board as a whole. While taking into consid-
eration the company’s specific situation, the composition of the
Supervisory Board should appropriately reflect the international
activities of the company, potential conflicts of interest, the num-
ber of independent members of the Supervisory Board pursuant to
section 5.4.2 of the Code, an age limit for members of the Supervi-
sory Board, a limit on the normal length of service on the board
and diversity. The special requirements of the German co-
determination legislation need to be taken into account for the
elected employee representatives. In accordance with section
5.4.1 (4) of the Code, the appointments proposed by the Supervi-
sory Board to the Annual General Meeting should take account of
the Supervisory Board’s objectives and targets while also seeking
to fulfil the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole.
Progress in implementing the targets should be published in the
corporate governance report.

The Supervisory Board of Commerzbank has approved the fol-
lowing concrete objectives:

The composition of the Supervisory Board should be such that,
overall, its members have the necessary skills, expertise, experi-
ence and knowledge to be able to perform its duties properly. In
particular, the Supervisory Board should have all the expertise and
experience deemed essential for the activities of the Commerz-
bank Group. The members of the Supervisory Board must be able
to challenge and monitor the decisions made by the Board of
Managing Directors. The target is that the Supervisory Board
should always have at least eight members elected by the Annual
General Meeting who are independent as defined in section 5.4.2
of the Code, and not more than two former members of the Board
of Managing Directors of Commerzbank AG. The normal length of
service of individual members of the Supervisory Board should not
exceed a period of 15 years, whereby the provisions of the Ger-
man Codetermination Act must be observed and given priority for
the employee representatives. The members of the Supervisory
Board should also be able to devote sufficient time to the perfor-
mance of their duties. Members should be reliable, and considera-
tion should be given to their commitment, personality, profession-
alism, integrity and independence. The Supervisory Board has
resolved a detailed responsibilities profile for its composition,
which readers may consult on Commerzbank’s website at
https://www.commerzbank.com. The Supervisory Board takes ac-

27

count of the targets and requirements set out there in its election
proposals to the Annual General Meeting and the regular assess-
ment of the Supervisory Board as a whole and its individual mem-
bers. None of the members of the Supervisory Board elected at the
Annual General Meeting exceed the normal length of service. All
other targets set by the Supervisory Board for its composition and
skills profile were also implemented as at 31 December 2018.

In accordance with section 5.4.1 (4) of the Code, the corporate
governance report should also provide information on what in the
view of the Supervisory Board is the appropriate number of inde-
pendent shareholder members and the names of these members.
Under section 5.4.2 of the Code, a Supervisory Board member is
not considered independent if he or she has a personal or business
relationship with the company, its corporate bodies, a controlling
shareholder or a company affiliated with a controlling shareholder
that could lead to a significant, non-transient conflict of interest.
The employee representatives are not taken into account in this
assessment of independence.

Applying the above-mentioned criteria, all ten shareholder rep-
resentatives can be classified as “independent”, namely Dr. Stefan
Schmittmann, Sabine U. Dietrich, Dr. Tobias Guldimann, Dr. Rain-
er Hillebrand, Dr. Markus Kerber, Anja Mikus, Dr. Victoria Os-
sadnik, Robin Stalker, Nicholas Teller and Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-
Gugerell.

As 100% of the Supervisory Board members on the sharehold-
er side are therefore independent, the Supervisory Board’s own
assessment that the Board contains a suitable number of inde-
pendent members is well-founded.

In accordance with section 5.6 of the German Corporate Gov-
ernance Code, the Supervisory Board reviewed the efficiency of its
work in the 2018 financial year as part of the assessment required
under Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of the German Banking Act. The
results of the efficiency audit were presented to the plenary ses-
sion for discussion. The members of the Supervisory Board believe
that the board works in an efficient manner and to a high standard
overall. Suggestions from members of the Supervisory Board have
been and continue to be taken into account for future activities.

Under section 5.5.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code
and Art. 3 (6) of the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board,
each member of the Supervisory Board must disclose any conflicts
of interest. No member of the Supervisory Board declared such a
conflict of interest during the year under review. Details of the re-
muneration paid to the members of the Supervisory Board are giv-
en in the remuneration report on pages 17 ff.

Diversity

At Commerzbank AG, attention is paid to diversity both in the
composition of the Board of Managing Directors, appointments to
management roles and in recommendations for the election of Su-
pervisory Board members (sections 4.1.5, 5.1.2 and 5.4.1 of the
Code). The aim is to reduce the risk of prejudice and “groupthink”.

In addition, diversity within the Board of Managing Directors and
Supervisory Board contributes to a broader range of experience
and a greater spectrum of knowledge, capabilities and expertise.

Diversity policy and targets for the Supervisory Board The Su-
pervisory Board of Commerzbank AG consists of 20 members. As
already mentioned in the description of the targets for the compo-
sition of the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board is supposed
to always have at least eight members elected by the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting who are independent (shareholder representatives)
as defined in section 5.4.2 of the Code and not more than two for-
mer members of the Board of Managing Directors of Commerz-
bank AG. The normal length of service of individual members of
the Supervisory Board should not exceed a period of 15 years,
whereby the provisions of the German Codetermination Act must
be observed and given priority for the employee representatives.
The Supervisory Board has also set a regular age limit of 72 and
aims to have a broad range of ages represented on the board. The
Supervisory Board also wants its members to have a suitable
range of educational and professional backgrounds and for the
board to have at least one international member. The Supervisory
Board also considers appropriate female representation when pro-
posing candidates to the Annual General Meeting for election. The
Supervisory Board is committed to fulfilling the statutory mini-
mum requirement of at least 30% female representation. It must
be borne in mind that the only way the Supervisory Board is able
to influence its composition is by the candidates it proposes to the
Annual General Meeting for election. The employee representa-
tives on the Supervisory Board also strive to attain a percentage of
female representation among employee representatives of at least
30%.

As at 31 December 2018, the Supervisory Board of Commerz-
bank AG included three international members and eight women,
of whom four were shareholder representatives. The percentage of
women on the Supervisory Board is therefore 40% at present.

Diversity policy and targets for the Board of Managing Direc-
tors The Nomination Committee of Commerzbank AG’s Supervi-
sory Board supports the Supervisory Board in selecting applicants
for positions on the Board of Managing Directors. It takes account
of the balance and range of knowledge, skills and experience of all
the board members, draws up a job description with an applicant
profile and indicates the time requirements associated with the
appointment. In making appointments to the Board of Managing
Directors, the Supervisory Board aims to increase diversity, par-
ticularly with regard to age, geographic origin, education and pro-
fessional background and to give appropriate consideration to
women. As a rule, the members of the Board of Managing Direc-
tors should not be over 65 years of age.

In terms of the proportion of women on Commerzbank AG's
Board of Managing Directors, for which the company is required


--- Page 26 ---

by law to stipulate a target, the Supervisory Board has set a target
of at least one female member by 31 December 2021. This target
has already been met. Dr. Bettina Orlopp, responsible for Compli-
ance, Human Resources and Legal, has been a member of the
Board of Managing Directors
1 November 2017. The proportion of women on Commerzbank
AG’s Board of Managing Directors was therefore 14.3% as at
31 December 2018.

of Commerzbank AG since

Targets for the first and second levels of management Art. 76
(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires the Board of
Managing Directors of Commerzbank AG to set target percentages
for female representation at the two levels of management below
the Board of Managing Directors and a deadline for achieving
these. In accordance with Art. 25 (1) of the Introductory Act of the
German Stock Corporation Act, the targets and deadlines had to
be set for the first time and documented by 30 September 2015.
The deadlines specified had to be no later than 30 June 2017. A
maximum period of five years applies to all subsequent deadlines
under Art. 76 (4) of the German Stock Corporation Act.

The full Board of Managing Directors last set new targets for
female representation in the first and second management levels of
Commerzbank AG (in Germany) in May 2017. The target is 17.5%
for the first management level and 20% for the second level. The
deadline set for achieving the targets is 31 December 2021.
Commerzbank AG has thus given itself ambitious targets. It is an
important objective for the Bank and the Group as a whole to fur-
ther increase the number of women in management positions.

As at 31 December 2018, the first management level below the
Board of Managing Directors in Commerzbank AG consisted of 35
people, of whom 30 were male and 5 female. The percentage of
women in the first level of management below the Board of Man-
aging Directors was therefore 14.3%.

The second management level below the Board of Managing
Directors consisted of 360 people, 298 of whom were male and 62
female. The percentage of women in the second level of manage-
ment below the Board of Managing Directors was thus 17.2%.

Accounting

Accounting at the Commerzbank Group and Commerzbank Ak-
tiengesellschaft gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
financial position and financial performance of the Group in com-
pliance with the respective accounting standards. The Group fi-
nancial statements and Group Management Report are prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and the additional requirements of the German Commercial
Code; the parent company financial statements and management
report of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are prepared in ac-
cordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code.
The Group financial statements and parent company financial
statements are prepared by the Board of Managing Directors and

approved by the Supervisory Board. The audit is performed by the
auditor elected by the Annual General Meeting.

The management report also includes a detailed risk report,
providing information on the Bank’s responsible handling of the
various types of risk. This appears on pages 44 ff. of this Annual
Report.

Shareholders and third parties receive additional information
on the course of business during the financial year in the form of
the semi-annual report and two quarterly reports. These interim
financial statements are also prepared in accordance with Interna-
tional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Shareholder relations, transparency and communication

The Annual General Meeting of shareholders takes place once a
year. It decides on the appropriation of distributable profit (if any)
and approves the actions of the Board of Managing Directors and
the Supervisory Board, the appointment of the auditors and any
amendments to the Articles of Association. If necessary, it author-
ises the Board of Managing Directors to undertake capital-raising
measures and approves the conclusion of profit and loss transfer
agreements. Each share entitles the holder to one vote.

In 2015, the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory
Board, as is permitted under Art. 120 (4) of the German Stock
Corporation Act, gave the Annual General Meeting the opportunity
to vote on the approval of the remuneration system for members of
the Board of Managing Directors. The 2015 Annual General Meet-
ing approved the principles of the variable remuneration system
and the fixed basic annual salary for members of the Board of
Managing Directors. The 2015 Annual General Meeting also voted
on the ratio of variable to fixed annual remuneration for members
of the Board of Managing Directors pursuant to Art. 25a (5) sen-
tence 5 of the German Banking Act and approved an increase in
the cap on variable annual remuneration for members of the Board
of Managing Directors of Commerzbank to 140% of the respective
fixed annual remuneration set from 2015 onwards. The revised
remuneration system of the Board of Managing Directors effective
from 1 January 2019 is described in more detail in the remunera-
tion report on page 17 and will be presented and explained to the
Annual General Meeting 2019.

Economic environment

The world economy enjoyed above-average growth once again in
2018, but with strong regional divergences. In China, growth
slowed due to the tighter economic policy. Overall, though, Asian
emerging markets kept up the high pace of growth seen in 2017.

In the USA, 2018 growth was much higher than in 2017 at an
estimated 2.9%. Unemployment is now below 4%. Against this
backdrop, the Federal Reserve decided to raise key interest rates
by a further 100 basis points to 2.25%-2.50% and continued to
slowly run down its holdings of securities.

In the eurozone, however, the upturn slowed noticeably in
2018. Growth was a full half-percentage point lower than in 2017
at 1.8%. One reason for this was the feeble rise in exports, espe-
cially to China. In the second half of the year, the economy was
also hurt by the difficult situation in the auto industry. Despite the
growth slowdown, the situation in the labour market continued to
significantly improve. The unemployment rate fell from 8.6% at
the end of 2017 to 7.9% in December 2018, almost back to the
low level seen before the financial crisis started. Greater competi-
tion for staff is now apparent in wages. So far, however, high wage
increases have not fed through into higher inflation. The core in-
flation rate, i.e. the year-on-year rate of the consumer price index
excluding the highly volatile food, luxury goods and energy prices,
continues to fluctuate around 1%.

The ECB stopped its bond purchasing programme at the year-
end. It will, though, reinvest all proceeds from maturing securities.

Germany’s economic growth also weakened significantly in
2018 (1.5%) versus 2017 (2.2%), but the growth was still suffi-
cient to reduce unemployment further. Seasonally-adjusted unem-
ployment at the start of 2019 was 5.0%, a new low since German
reunification. The main brakes on the economy were weaker for-
eign demand and the difficult situation in the auto industry.

Financial markets were unsettled by ongoing rate hikes by the
Federal Reserve and the trade conflict between the USA and Chi-
na. Stock prices were down sharply and the dollar appreciated
considerably. Despite the rising rates in the USA, the yield on ten-
year treasury notes ended 2018 0.3% lower than at the start of the
year.

Sector environment

2018 was a year of contrasts for the financial services industry.
January was one of the best months for equity markets in history,
giving one of the most powerful starts to the year in over 35 years.
February was more sobering and big price falls in just two weeks
unsettled many clients.


--- Page 28 ---

The second half of 2018 saw an appreciable rise in internation-
al uncertainties compared to the start of the year. The trade dis-
pute between the USA and China broadened out as both sides
brought in ever higher and more extensive tariffs. Concern about
some emerging markets rose, putting exchange rates in these
countries under pressure. With negotiations proving difficult, the
uncertainties associated with the UK’s departure from the Europe-
an Union also increased. When the new Italian government then
submitted the main points of its draft budget, risk premiums and
the volatility of Italian government bonds rose again. These nega-
tive factors put particular pressure on European equities, with
banks disproportionately affected by the uncertainties. By contrast
bonds regarded as particularly safe, such as German government
securities, were in high demand and the volatility on markets for
risky investments rose perceptibly worldwide.

Over the year as a whole the banking sector received much less
support from overall economic activity than in 2017. In both the
eurozone and Germany, annual average economic growth was
down year-on-year in 2018; with Germany's export growth, which
is key for German banks’ corporate business, declining by almost
half. In contrast, total domestic demand maintained its growth
pace, owing to the strong labour market and the good financial
position of the corporate sector, which in turn supported demand
for residential mortgages and corporate loans. The auto industry,
which is key for the banking sector, faced a series of problems in
2018 that spilled over into other sectors.

The Eurosystem’s expanded asset purchase programme im-
proved banks’ liquidity position and financing conditions in 2018,
but at the same time it put pressure on net interest margins and
thus had a significant adverse impact on earnings — even though
loans to the domestic private sector grew at a faster rate. While
the banks’ efforts to reduce solvency and liquidity risks and theit
greater resilience to the 2018 stress test were recognised, there
were persistent fears about a sustained weakening of the profita-
bility of the banking system in the eurozone and the ability of
banks to generate profitable returns on interest-rate-based busi-
ness.

Last but not least, the importance of cyber security and compli-
ance was once again demonstrated in the year under review. The
protection of data networks and appropriate staff training are an
ongoing process which the banking sector must take very serious-
ly, despite its already strong understanding of IT security. The
same applies to ensuring compliance with the legal and regulatory
requirements.

Overall, the fundamental transformation of the European bank-
ing system continued in 2018. The sector today is smaller, more
clearly focused on its core functions and less profitable, but also
more robust and resilient to future crises.

Important staffing and business policy events

With the conclusion of the agreement to sell Equity Mar-
kets & Commodities, another milestone was reached in the imple-
mentation of the Commerzbank 4.0 strategy. The marked im-
provement in the results of the stress test conducted by the
European Banking Authoritiy is a further demonstration of the
Bank’s healthy risk profile and high resilience to stress. With its
inaugural green bond the Bank is sending an important signal
about the growing significance of this asset class, while also high-
lighting its sustainability strategy. The Bank also further strength-
ened its compliance function. There were some changes in per-
sonnel during the year, within both the Board of Managing
Directors and the Supervisory Board.

Newly elected Commerzbank Supervisory Board

As proposed by the Supervisory Board, the Annual General Meet-
ing on 8May 2018 elected Sabine U. Dietrich, Dr. Tobias
Guldimann, Dr. Rainer Hillebrand, Dr. Markus Kerber, Anja
Mikus, Dr. Victoria Ossadnik, Dr. Stefan Schmittmann, Robin J.
Stalker, Nicholas Teller and Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell to the
Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. The elec-
tion of the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board
had already taken place at the start of 2018. At its first meeting
following the Annual General Meeting, the Supervisory Board
elected Dr. Stefan Schmittmann as its chairman. For full details of
the Supervisory Board and the composition of the individual
committees, please refer to the Commerzbank website at
https:/Awww.commerzbank.com/supervisoryboard.

Changes in the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank
At the Supervisory Board meeting held on 5 December 2018 Mi-
chael Reuther, the member of the Board of Managing Directors of
Commerzbank responsible for corporate customer business, an-
nounced that he would like to complete his contract running until
the end of September 2019 but that he would decline any offer to
extend it. At the same meeting the Supervisory Board accepted
with regret the request from Chief Operating Officer Frank An-
nuscheit to step down from the Board of Managing Directors on
28 February 2019 for health reasons. Frank Annuscheit’s succes-
sor is Jorg Hessenmiiller, who was previously a member of the
Divisional Board for Digital Transformation & Strategy. Jorg Hes-
senmiiller’s appointment to the Board of Managing Directors was
confirmed by the regulator on 15 January 2019.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Commerzbank issues inaugural green bond

In mid-October 2018, Commerzbank issued its inaugural green
bond in the capital market. The issue raised €500m. Commerz-
bank will use the proceeds to refinance renewable energy projects.
With the inaugural green bond, the Bank is sending an important
signal about the growing significance of this asset class. The non-
preferred senior bond attracted keen investor interest. The final
order book at reoffer was above €1.1bn. The bond has a term of
five years. The coupon is 1.25% p.a. Commerzbank already has
wide experience in the green bond market. For years, Commerz-
bank has been successfully supporting its corporate clients to pre-
pare their sustainable bond issues and place them in the interna-
tional capital market. The bond is structured in accordance with
the Green Bond Principles. This market standard provides inves-
tors with a high degree of transparency as regards how the funds
are actually used. Commerzbank has earmarked the bond pro-
ceeds for loans for onshore and offshore wind projects and solar
projects in Germany, other European countries and North and
South America. Commerzbank is committed to the objective set at
the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015 to limit global
warming to less than two degrees Celsius versus pre-industrial
levels. The associated energy revolution and reduction in COz
emissions are creating a need for new technologies and products
requiring large investments.

Commerzbank scores good result in the EBA stress test
Commerzbank considerably improved its result in the 2018 stress
test conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA), despite
a further tightening of the adverse scenario. This is a further sign
of Commerzbank’s healthy risk profile and high resilience to
stress. Under the adverse stress scenario, the common equity tier
one (CET 1) ratio is 9.9% at the end of the review period in 2020.
That is 2.5 percentage points higher than in the last test in 2016.

Key milestone in implementing the Commerzbank 4.0 strategy
On 8 November 2018, Commerzbank and Société Générale signed
a purchase agreement for the Equity Markets & Commodities divi-
sion (EMC). On 3 July 2018, the two banks had already announced
an agreement to sell Commerzbank’s EMC business to Société
Générale. The employee representative bodies in Germany con-
sented to the transaction, which remains subject to the consent of
the relevant authorities.

The Commerzbank EMC business includes issuing and market
making in structured trading and investment products, the estab-
lished ComStage brand for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the
associated leading platform for ETF market making. The equity
capital markets (ECM) business, equity trading and equity sales
brokerage are not part of this transaction. The same applies to the
business in hedging products for commodity risk. These activities
will remain at Commerzbank as part of the strategic customer
business. The transaction will see trading books, customer busi-
ness, employees and parts of the IT infrastructure transferred.
EMC front office staff and some employees in downstream units
are to move to Société Générale. Transfer of the trading books and
the corresponding impact on the balance sheet and income will
take place in stages.

Further strengthening of the compliance function

The Bank continued its activities in 2018 to further strengthen the
compliance function. As before this pertains not only to structural
changes. We also diligently pushed ahead with building up inter-
nal staff, staff training and the successful recruitment of additional
experienced compliance experts to work at head office and in for-
eign locations. Following the creation of a dedicated compliance
trainee programme in 2017, 2018 again saw further graduates
hired for this new international programme.

The compliance function implemented various measures relat-
ing to global financial crime, global markets compliance and anti-
bribery and corruption in order to improve the management of
compliance risks. Steps were also taken to further strengthen
compliance governance in Germany and abroad. Amongst other
things, the strengthening of the global compliance system land-
scape in line with the latest market standards is being rigorously
driven forward. Commerzbank also set up compliance coordina-
tion units in the front office and continued its activities to expand
structures and further improve the existing compliance processes
in the business units.

In 2015, Commerzbank reached settlements with various US
authorities regarding violations of US sanctions and anti-money
laundering provisions. In terms of the findings relating to the set-
tlements, the Bank has dealt with the majority of the findings. The
Bank has also received various interim reports and the final report
from the monitor appointed by the New York State Department of
Financial Services (DFS), to which it has responded with corre-
sponding implementation programmes. The Bank continues to
make good progress in carrying out the implementation pro-
grammes and has dealt with most of the measures. The DFS will
confirm when the monitorship ends. This decision has not yet
been taken.

In accordance with the requirements of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), in 2017 Commerzbank London
mandated a consulting company as a “skilled person”. The con-
sulting company carried out a review of existing structures and
processes (especially with regard to money laundering/financing
of terrorism as well as sanctions/embargoes) and prepared a re-
port for the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Commerzbank
London subsequently put in place a full-scale remediation project,
the implementation of which is being evaluated by the skilled per-
son and reported to the FCA half yearly. Here, too, Commerzbank
made good progress in implementation.

Since 31 December 2012, Commerzbank has been provisionally
registered as a swap dealer with the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC). On 8 November 2018, Commerzbank
reached agreement with the CFTC in a consent order waiving an

investigation into breach of the U.
U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations of the CFTC.

swap dealer rules under the

The consent order also stipulates that Commerzbank must retain
an outside consultant approved by the CFTC for a period of two
years. The CFTC may extend this period by a further year at its
discretion, based on its assessment of Commerzbank’s remedial
efforts. During the review period, the outside consultant will pro-
duce annual reports assessing the swap dealer’s compliance with
the Commodities Exchange Act and the regulations of the CFTC.
The report will also contain recommendations on improving the
swap dealer's practices, policies and procedures. The outside con-
sultant will start work once the ongoing CFTC approval process
has been completed.

bank, please see the combined separate non-financial report on

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

Earnings performance, assets and
financial position

Commerzbank changed the measurement for own credit spread of
the derivatives portfolio in 2018. It was adjusted to match the cur-
rent trends in comparable instruments. This adjustment resulted in
a remeasurement effect of €-70m. A description of the changes
can be found on page 83 of the financial statements.

Commerzbank had unrestricted access to the money and capi-
tal markets throughout the reporting period, and its liquidity and
solvency were also adequate at all times. It was always able to
raise the resources required for a balanced funding mix and con-
tinued to enjoy a comfortable liquidity position in the period under
review.

Income statement

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft made a net profit of €262m in
2018, following a net profit of €176m in the previous year. The
changes in the individual earnings components are set out below.

Net interest income, the balance of interest income and interest
expense, rose €0.4bn year on year to €3,572m. The business with
private and small-business customers managed to increase its net
interest income considerably year on year. This was largely due to
a full twelve months of interest income from the instalment loan
portfolio taken over in August 2017. Following a further decline in
deposit-related income the previous year, the domestic deposit
business made a noticeably higher contribution to income in 2018.
In corporate clients the growth path paid off. The negative impact
from interest rates, restrained demand for capital market and
hedging products and intense price competition was almost fully
compensated.

At €2,497m, net commission income was 4.3% lower than in
the previous year. In the business with private and small-business
customers, net commission income declined slightly from the pre-
vious year. This reflects the complete absence of commission in-
come from referring consumer loans, which since the first half of
2017 have been offered over Commerzbank’s own platform. There
was also a significant decline in transaction-related commission
income in the domestic securities business, as customer activity
was muted with MiFID II coming into effect at the start of 2018.
Payment services, by contrast, enjoyed growth in commissions. In
the corporate client business, net commission income was lower
than the previous year, mainly due to a lower contribution from
hedging and capital market products.

33

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Net trading income came to €217m in the reporting year (pre-
vious year: €879m). The decline was primarily the result of a much
lower mark-to-market result than last year.

The balance of other operating income and expenses for the
reporting period was €-679m, compared with €-1,167m the pre-
vious year. The clearly negative result was mainly due to higher
interest expenses for retirement benefit obligations and increased
allocations to provisions. In the previous year, settlement of a
write-down at a foreign subsidiary was the main cause of the neg-
ative impact on earnings.

The cost of assuming subsidiaries’ losses under profit and loss
transfer agreements was €9m, after €25m in the previous year.
Income from profit pooling and from partial or full profit transfer
agreements came to €502m, compared to €227m the previous
year. The increase was largely due to a sale of shares in a subsidi-
ary within the Group and income from the sale of real estate. This
resulted in net income from profit and loss transfer agreements of
€493m, after €202m the previous year.

Operating expenses fell 1.0% to €5,579m in the reporting year.
Personnel expenses (mainly wages and salaries) fell 1.8% to
€2,955m. At €2,624m, other operating expenses were at the same
level as in the previous year. While IT expenses were up, as were
contributions for the European banking levy, consultancy costs
were down year on year. Depreciation, amortisation and write-
downs of intangible and fixed assets increased by 9.9% to €536m
in the year under review. This rise was due to higher amortisation
of intangible assets.

For 2018, income from write-ups on loans and certain securi-
ties and from the release of provisions in lending business came to
€203m, after €1,535m the year before.

As a result of the income statement items described above,
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft posted a profit on ordinary activ-
ities of €318m in 2018, compared with €1,273m in the previous
year.

An extraordinary expense of €-46m was recorded in the period
under review. The figure of €-786m in 2017 was impacted by re-
structuring expenses in connection with the Commerzbank 4.0
strategy.

Tax expenses amounted to €10m for the reporting year, com-
pared with €311m in the previous year. Taxes on income declined,
largely due to various tax effects relating to other periods.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft therefore made a net profit of
€262m in 2018 after €176m in the previous year. Subject to the
approval of the decision-making bodies, the corresponding net
profit will be used to pay a dividend of €0.20 per share and to fur-
ther strengthen retained earnings.

Balance sheet

Total assets of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft rose 4.2% or
€15.6bn year on year to €383.2bn.

Within assets, the cash reserve fell by €0.6bn to €49.0bn. This
slight decrease from the end of 2017 came from the reallocation of
demand deposits held with central banks to the cash reserve in
accordance with the applicable terms and conditions. Claims on
banks rose compared with the previous year, by €6.3bn to
€48.9bn. This was the result of a significant increase in secured
money market transactions in the form of reverse repos. Claims on
customers grew by €8.8bn to €206.0bn. The main cause for this
was the sharp €5.6bn rise in lending business and an increase of
€4.8bn in retail property and mortgage loans. Bonds and other
fixed-income securities rose by €0.6bn to €32.0bn. The increase
was due to larger holdings of bonds and notes in the liquidity port-
folio. Trading assets recorded a volume of €32.2bn, compared
with €30.8bn in the previous year. The rise was mainly related to
the fair value of financial derivatives. Holdings in affiliated compa-
nies declined by €0.2bn from €5.8bn at the end of 2017 to €5.5bn.

On the liabilities side, liabilities to banks — especially in connec-
tion with the growth in term deposits and higher repos and cash
collaterals — increased sharply by 11.5% to €74.8bn. Liabilities to
customers were €210.2bn, €3.4bn higher than the level at the end
of the previous year. Sight deposits were up €13.7bn, repos and
cash collaterals up €2.5bn and liabilities from money market
transactions up €3.8bn, whereas term deposits and registered
Pfandbriefe fell
€37.6bn, €4.8bn higher than the previous year. The rise was the

by a total of €16.8bn. Securitised liabilities were

result of growth in both bonds and other securitised liabilities.
Trading liabilities recorded a volume of €20.7bn, compared with
€18.6bn in the previous year. This €2.1bn rise was the result of
higher negative fair values for derivative transactions. Subordinat-
ed liabilities totalled €8.5bn, €0.6bn lower year on year. At
€0.1bn, profit-sharing certificates were unchanged year on year.

Off-balance-sheet liabilities rose overall year on year, with con-
tingent liabilities up 9.8% year on year at €37.6bn and irrevocable
lending commitments down €1.6bn to €73.5bn.

Equity

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s reported equity as at
31 December 2018 was €0.2bn higher compared with year-end
2017, at €22.7bn. Both the capital reserve and subscribed capital
were almost unchanged on the prior year, at €17.2bn and €1.7bn.
respectively. Retained earnings were up €0.1bn on the end-2017
level, standing at €3.6bn.

Since 2007, the Bank has made use of the waiver rule of Art. 2a
of the German Banking Act (KWG), which means it only reports
risk-weighted assets and capital ratios for the banking group to the
supervisory authority.

Risk-weighted assets (fully phased-in) were €180.5bn as at
31 December 2018, €9.5bn above the year-end 2017 level. The
increase was largely caused by a growth-driven rise in risk-
weighted assets from credit risks, which was only slightly offset by
reductions from IFRS 9 adjustments and a further reduction of
wind-down portfolios. The slight increase in risk-weighted assets
from operational risk is made up by a marginal fall in risk-
weighted assets from market risk. Regulatory Tier 1 capital (on a
“phased-in” basis) fell by €1.9bn to €24.1bn compared with year-
end 2017, chiefly as a result of the next stage in the Basel 3 phase-
in and the conversion to IFRS 9, although this was party compen-
sated by the regulatory eligible profit and lower regulatory deduc-
tions. The corresponding Tier 1 ratio fell to 13.4%. Common Equi-
ty Tier 1 capital was €23.2bn and the corresponding Common
Equity Tier 1 ratio 12.9%. The total capital ratio was 16.3% as at
the reporting date. The leverage ratio based on the CRD IV/CRR.
rules applicable on that date, which compares Tier 1 capital with
leverage exposure, was 5.0% (phase-in) or 4.8% (fully phased-in).

The Bank complies with all regulatory requirements. This in-

Summary of 2018 business position

Commerzbank made further progress in implementing _ its
Commerzbank 4.0 strategy in 2018 and again grew in its core
business, even though the environment was extremely challeng-
ing.

As the Bank is managed via its segments, the information that
follows is largely geared towards the performance of the Group.
For more information on corporate management and the key fig-
ures and data used to manage the Group, please see page 65 of
the Group Annual Report 2018. From the Group perspective, the
slight decline in operating income year on year was in line with
our expectations and mainly related to lower adjusted income;
with the cost base stable, the cost/income ratio rose slightly as
expected. Adjusting for one-off income, the objective of improved
quality of income and earnings last year was achieved. Overall, we
managed to increase consolidated net profit significantly

year in 2018, as forecast.

year on

The Private and Small-Business Customers segment faced very
challenging conditions in 2018 but achieved major objectives in
terms of improved market position and hence profitability. Pro-
gress was made in all divisions of the segment both in digitalising
services and processes and expanding and bringing together the
distribution channels. A major strategic milestone in new custom-
er growth was also reached in 2018: the segment has gained one
million net new customers since the Commerzbank 4.0 strategy
was launched, almost 420,000 in 2018 alone. High volumes of new
business were again achieved in lending in 2018. This was the
case in both retail mortgage financing and the instalment loan
business. In the Corporate Clients segment, 2018 saw a number of
challenges. The persistently low level of interest rates, intense
price competition in the German market and the regulatory envi-
ronment were reflected in the earnings performance. In addition,
increased geopolitical uncertainty factors held back customer ac-
tivity considerably. As a result, it was no longer possible to achieve
our expectations of a slight rise in income. At the mid-year stage
in 2018 we therefore adjusted our income forecast for the full fi-
nancial year. The ACR segment made further great progress in
2018 in winding down the remaining assets and risks that do not
form part of the core business of Commerzbank. Total volume as
measured by exposure at default fell by more than a third year on
year. The considerable improvement in the risk situation is also
reflected in the reduction of the sub-portfolio with the greatest
credit risks, commercial real estate and ship finance.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s overall net profit for the re-
porting year was €262m, after €176m in the previous year. Profit-
ability was therefore above what we had predicted for 2018.

Outlook and opportunities report

Future economic situation

The global economy looks set to grow somewhat slower in 2019.
The greatest risk comes from China, where the economy has clear-
ly lost momentum. In addition, the trade dispute with the USA is
weighing on the outlook for the Chinese economy. As in previous
years, politicians are likely to prevent a collapse in the economy
that could place political and social stability at risk. The govern-
ment has already taken countermeasures and provided relief to

individuals and companies through tax cuts. Monetary policy has
also been loosened. If the actions taken so far prove insufficient,
more are likely to follow.

The upturn in the USA will probably continue in 2019. There
are no signs of excesses where a correction might drive the econ-
omy into a recession. However, the rate hikes and the slackening
support from fiscal policy will likely result in a more moderate
pace of growth. But the US economy is still set to grow by 2.5% in
2019, faster than productive potential. The already low unem-
ployment rate will decline further. This is likely to strengthen un-
derlying inflation slightly. The US Federal Reserve will probably
not raise its benchmark rates any further in 2019. The biggest risk
to the US economy comes from politics. The tussle between the
Republicans and Democrats, who hold the majority in the House
of Representatives since the elections in November, and the trade
dispute with China are causing unease.

Real gross domestic product Change from previous year 2018 20191 2020:
USA 2.9% 2.5% 1.8%
Eurozone 1.8% 1.4% 1.6%
Germany 1.5% 1.2% 2.0%
Central and Eastern Europe 3.0% 1.6% 2.2%
Poland 5.1% 3.2% 3.3%

" The figures for 2019 and 2020 are all Commerzbank forecasts.

In the eurozone the upturn noticeably slowed in 2018. However,
the economy is unlikely to slip into recession. Domestic demand
continues to be driven by the ECB’s expansive monetary policy.
The ECB terminated its bond buying programme at the end of the
year. But that does not mean the end of loose monetary policy. The
ECB deposit rate is likely to remain at -0.4% for a considerable
time. Low interest rates are making the still high debt levels of
many companies and households more sustainable. The foreign
trade environment is also likely to brighten a little as the Chinese
economy stabilises. However, although economic growth is set to
pick up further in the course of the year, the average for 2019 will
probably be only close to 1.4%. The planned UK departure from
the EU is likely to have only a temporary impact on the economy
in the eurozone. The economy is unlikely to slip into recession
even if the EU and UK are unable to reach an exit agreement. Both
sides will be keen to minimise the economic turbulence.

After a weak second half in 2018, the German economy is likely
to gain speed again over the course of 2019. The main support for
the economy will be investment, which remains robust. However,
consumption and exports should provider stronger boosts again as
the year progresses. For the year as a whole we expect growth of
1.2%, after 1.5% last year. It is worthy of note, however, that unit
labour costs at German companies have been rising faster than in
the rest of the monetary union for several years now. And in the
property market, low interest rates are still driving up prices, es-
pecially in the major cities.

The end of interest rate hikes in the USA and the continuation
of the ECB’s highly expansive monetary policy will shape the fi-
nancial markets in 2019. Even after the end to ECB bond purchas-
es the yield on 10-year German government bonds will not rise
materially. Not only because there is no prospect of a genuine cy-
cle of rate hikes, but because the ECB will be reinvesting the
bonds that mature.


--- Page 34 ---

It will therefore hold just under one-third of government bonds
for a long time to come, permanently pushing down the maturity
premium on them. The euro will probably tend to appreciate
against the dollar in 2019. This is not a matter of euro strength,
but rather the dollar weakness that is likely as the end of the Fed-

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

eral Reserve's cycle of rate hikes draws nearer. Equity markets
should recover from last year's setback in 2019, once it becomes
apparent that there is no threat of a global recession. The persis-
tently loose monetary policy is also supportive of equity valua-
tions.

Future situation in the banking sector

Our views regarding the expected development of the banking
sector structurally and over the medium term have not changed
significantly since the statements published in the interim report
as at 30 June 2018. However, the risks to short-term prospects
for the banking environment have risen further in recent months,
and unlike one year previously the risks are now mainly to the
downside.

The financial sector will enjoy less support from the overall
economic environment in 2019 than in the previous two years. The
fact that the global economy, the eurozone and Germany remain
on the growth track and there is no threat of recession in the most
likely scenario is a positive. The corporate and small-business cus-
tomer business in Germany will benefit from the further growth in
capital investment and exports, albeit to a lesser degree than in
2018. By contrast, business with private customers will enjoy the
positive impact of stable growth in private consumption, construc-
tion investment, the persistent strength of the labour market and a
strong ability to save. Large repayments by customers and the in-
creased use of internal and alternative external sources of funding,
along with tough competition, will also limit income growth. Fur-
thermore, 2019 will again be a year with no sign of a traditional
cycle of interest rate hikes in the eurozone. We do not expect the
deposit rate to be increased until after March 2020. There is still
no prospect of a genuine turning point in monetary policy or a
perceptible steepening of the yield curve in the eurozone. Banks
thus remain exposed on this front, and market participants’ incen-
tives to place their money in risky investments are not weakening.

The downside risks have risen in the period under review and a
sharper awareness of them means there is a risk that the private
sector will review its consumption and investment decisions and
hence that the corporate and retail customer business will experi-
ence stronger headwinds from the real economic and financial
environment at interest-earnings and commission business level
than previously assumed. The growing disconnect between the
growth prospects for the real economy, which remain solid, and
the increasing disquiet among investors and companies, is having
a negative impact on the banking environment.

Over-reactions on the financial markets and misallocations in
the real economy caused by the lengthy period of expansive
monetary policy would have a direct impact on the banking sector
through interest rate and commission business. The already rela-
tively high valuation of equities and bonds, real estate and private
equity has built up considerable potential for disappointment
which may not yet have unwound as the environment for various
risk assets deteriorated in 2018. The expectations of market par-
ticipants are still very one-sided. Investors who normally buy safe
assets might panic at (further) market turbulence, and pro-cyclical
investors have become much more significant. In their reports on
financial stability, the Deutsche Bundesbank and the European
Central Bank both drew attention to the challenging environment
for the financial sector. The German banking sector is vulnerable
to a scenario in which the macroeconomic environment undergoes
an unexpectedly sharp deterioration. The risk of fears about the
sustainability of the level of debt in countries with large borrow-
ings has grown, as has the potential risk of liquidity tensions in the
investment fund sector. We should also point out the risk of a sud-
den rise in risk premiums and the dangers for banks ability to act
as intermediaries.

A largely disorderly UK departure from the EU without any
transitional period or free trade agreement could cause harm to
the German banking sector, even though there would be marginal-
ly positive value creation effects as market-related financial ser-
vices are moved to Germany. The current level of integration be-
tween the UK and the EU, especially Germany, is very high, due to
specialisation in the internal market and international value
chains. Banks foreign business with key German export industries
could be affected. This applies, through trading, to cars, engineer-
ing, electricals, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food and textiles. De-
liveries of intermediate goods are significant at the macro and mi-
cro-economic level for both Germany and the UK. Research by the
Ifo Institute shows that at least 550,000 jobs in Germany depend
on exports to the UK, hence business with retail bank customers
would be directly affected. Germany is one of the world’s largest
exporters of services as well as goods. Services are a very im-
portant part of domestic and cross-border value chains and fre-
quently accompany exports of goods. The Deutsche Bundesbank
recently demonstrated that the costs from an increase in trade bar-
riers for services can be very significant for some countries. In
addition, the UK’s departure from the EU internal market and the
customs union may affect trade with other EU countries. Banks
have to hope that their credit customers identify the risks Brexit
will have for their own business models and mitigate these. In the
short term there would be major general downside risk for the
macroeconomic environment from market jitters and political un-
certainty, with a negative impact on the customers of the banking
sector. The perception of serious institutional consequences from
the departure of one of the three large member states (in terms of
the balance of power in the EU, a potential change of direction on
free trade and the effect on the EU budget) could add to this. If the
UK government lowers regulatory standards in the banking sector
after Brexit to support London as a financial centre, the competi-
tive position of the banks in the remaining EU countries would be
harmed. If London, Europe’s financial centre, loses
access to the European single market this would increase frag-
mentation in investment banking, and equity, liquidity and other
resources will have to be committed separately and profitability
will suffer as a result. In the worst-case scenario, according to the
Deutsche Bundesbank, bottlenecks, frictions and an absence of

its unrestricted

licenses might mean some activities have to be shut down entirely.

There is also ongoing uncertainty on the markets regarding
capital adequacy, valuation of credit risks and credit security, in-
terest rate risks, non-performing loans, cyber risks and especially
profitability of European banks.

The focus remains on individual business models for sustaina-
ble profit generation and stress resistance in the low interest rate
environment. Full-service banks have to demonstrate that they can
make up for the high costs of complexity in the current regulatory
environment by economies of scale, despite their relatively low
market share in Germany. One of the main challenges still facing
banks is to adapt their business models — in view of ongoing over-
capacity in some countries coupled with new technology-driven
competitors — to the changed conditions, reduce costs and in-
crease profitability. This means pushing ahead with the systematic
modernisation of banking operations and making sufficient capaci-
ty available for digitalisation.

Essentially, the banking sector in the eurozone is still in the
midst of a protracted period of structural change. The stronger
capital base is offset by reductions in implicit government guaran-
tees, stricter rules on resolution and greater creditor loss partici-
pation. A further reduction in leverage exposure levels and im-
proved asset quality in an increasingly digitalised and automated
industry are still essential if the banking sector is to meet the
tougher requirements of banking supervisors and fulfil investor
expectations.

The outlook for the banking environment in Poland remains
gloomy for the medium term as a result of economic policy and
the threat of considerable reductions in EU infrastructure funds.
The close trade and income relations with the UK would also
cause temporary uncertainty in the event of a disorderly Brexit.
The Polish economy continues to grow relatively strongly, though.
After a healthy rise of around 5.1% in economic output last year,
2019 is likely to see a slowdown to 3.2% growth. Private con-
sumption will again play a major role, accentuated by fiscal policy
measures such as support programmes for families and pension-
ers. However, consumer confidence appears to have peaked and
private consumption, which is so important, will probably grow
less strongly this year than in 2018. In addition, as the funding
period draws to an end, an increasing amount of EU funding can
be expected to be drawn down, which should support investment
in 2019. The positive trend in wages and unemployment should
generally boost credit volumes, and the solid position of private
households and the corporate sector will be reflected favourably in
banks’ risk costs.

Managing opportunities at Commerzbank

The demands placed on modern, sustainable banking business
and the overall framework conditions have changed markedly in
the past few years. The pressure on profitability has increased sig-
nificantly in respect of both earnings and costs. Rising competition
means old structures have to be reviewed and new paths taken.
Whereas in the past, personal customer relationship management
was a key element of banking, these days our customers expect
multi-channel advisory services, digital financial offerings and in-
dividual, tailor-made products. We are rising to these challenges
with the strategic initiatives we have launched and in some cases
have already successfully implemented. But we face additional
challenges from increasingly stringent regulatory requirements.
With this in mind, the constant review of internal processes, struc-
tures and technical platforms to make ourselves leaner, more effi-
cient and more customer-oriented is not a one-off project but an
ongoing process that will occupy us on an ongoing basis and
should enable us to largely counteract the significantly tougher
requirements.

The Commerzbank 4.0 strategy announced in autumn 2016 has
three main thrusts. Firstly, we are concentrating on businesses
with clear competitive advantages and selling non-core activities.
Secondly, we are transforming ourselves into a digital enterprise.
And thirdly, we are simplifying the Bank’s structure and thus
boosting our efficiency. Our aim is to be the leading bank in Ger-
many for private, small-business and corporate clients. We want to
provide a modern and considered range of digital and personal
services, close to the customer and offering fast and efficient pro-
cessing. We will remain personal and digital: the customer can
decide which channel to use to contact us. The Bank focusses its
customer activities in two strong sales segments — Private and
Small-Business Customers and Corporate Clients.

By 2020 the Private and Small-Business Customers segment
will a digital multi-channel bank in Germany. The key elements of
this are digital and analogue service offerings, new sales platforms
and a differentiated branch concept. We are sticking to our nation-
al presence with 1,000 branches, over 100 wealth management
locations, 330 locations for small-business customers and 100 lo-
cations for corporate customers. On 1 September 2018 we
launched a new management structure and new market divisions
in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment and the new
advisory models for small-business and corporate customers. This
marks a major step in the implementation of the Commerzbank 4.0
strategy but we want to achieve faster growth by combining digital
platform strategies with modern branch formats. The “ONE” sales
application is a standardised technical platform for online and
branch sales. Broad-based market coverage is assured through
flagship branches focusing on advisory services and city branches
that combine efficient customer service with a reduced infrastruc-
ture and lower operating costs. With the aim of gaining two mil-

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

lion net new customers by 2020, the Bank is offering attractive
products such as digital instalment loans and digital asset man-
agement and working with partners such as Tchibo, Amazon and
Lufthansa. Small-business customers are handled in a separate
business unit within the Private and Small-Business Customers
segment. We combine strong expertise in private customer busi-
ness with the credit experience of Mittelstandsbank. With new dig-
ital offerings coupled with a nationwide local presence we wish to
significantly increase our share of the business customer and
smaller Mittelstand customer markets from 5% to 8%. The holis-
tic advisory services take both business and private considerations
into account.

The Corporate Clients segment combines the Bank’s traditional
strengths in corporate banking - a national presence coupled with
support for customers entering international markets, a unique
relationship management model and a leading range of trade and
export financing services — with the capital market know-how of
our investment bank. We are thus creating the optimal framework
for developing solutions tailored to the specific needs of larger
companies. We will also leverage our expertise in Germany's key
industries at a European level in order to better harness it for in-
ternational growth. Our aim is to be the leading provider of hedg-
ing products for corporate clients and the number one debt house.
We strive to ensure a consistently high quality of advice world-
wide. Corporate customer advisors in Germany not only coordi-
nate the involvement of product specialists, they also work with
the Bank’s global client service teams. The multilingual relation-
ship managers and specialists on the European desks in their
global markets are in constant contact with corporate customer
advisors in the domestic market. New data analysis tools (e.g. the
foreign payments dashboard) put us a step ahead of the competi-
tion and support the corporate customer sales team with specific
transaction approaches and analyses of potential to achieve in-
come. We are the first bank in Germany to offer our corporate cus-
tomers a fully digitalised advisory process for both interest and
currency risk management and investment management. We have
also introduced a digital lending platform that allows mid-sized
companies to apply for an overdraft of up to €5m entirely digitally.

We will transform the Bank into a digital enterprise across all
segments. This restructuring affects strategy, technology, compe-
tence and culture. We will actively drive forward digitalisation in
the banking business and be a technology leader. We want to be
number one in all technologies that provide our customers with
speed, security and convenience. For some time now, we have
been involved in start-ups, both directly and through our subsi
aries CommerzVentures, main incubator and the digitalisation
platform #openspace. We support entrepreneurs with good ideas,
so we have a finger on the pulse of tomorrow's innovations. The

Digital Leadership programme will support our managers in their
multiplier role for digital change. Commerzbank was the first bank
to set up an enterprise lab at the Fraunhofer Institute for Material

Flow and Logistics IML. The Trade Finance Innovation Lab covers
financial services, focusing on trade financing. It will develop new
payment and financing solutions for the trade finance business
using innovative technologies and bring to them market maturity.

The Digital Campus has become the engine driving the
Commerzbank transformation, where we test and develop new,
agile working methods and new forms of cooperation. This will
bring us to results more quickly and allow us to deal with changes
more flexibly. Having gained one and a half years of experience
with the Digital Campus, we are now in a position to further ex-
pand this new form of cooperation. We can now step up the pace
and drive the transformation forwards more vigorously. We will
further extend our Digital Campus success in the Campus 2.0 pro-
ject and will restructure the head office. We are creating what is
known as a “cluster delivery organisation”. In future, sales will
receive functioning solutions more quickly and be able to focus
entirely on customers’ needs. Instead of traditional hierarchies
there will be agile working teams or “cells”. Each cell is multi-
functional and combines technical and IT expertise. They can de-
velop a complete product and deliver it to customers and are also.
responsible for operating the systems later. All cells work inde-
pendently in around 50 clusters on developing new products and
processes in specific areas.

Commerzbank anticipates that its capital market funding re-
quirement over the coming years will be of the order of €10bn.
Commerzbank offers a broad range of products in the capital mar-
ket. In addition to unsecured funding instruments (preferred and
non-preferred senior bonds and Tier 2 subordinated debt), when
refinancing Commerzbank can also issue secured funding instru-
ments, in particular mortgage Pfandbriefe and public-sector
Pfandbriefe. As such, Pfandbriefe are a key element of Commerz-
bank’s funding mix. These give Commerzbank stable access to
long-term funding with cost advantages compared with unsecured
sources of funding. Issuance formats range from large-volume
benchmark bonds to private placements. Commerzbank does not
anticipate any negative effects on the placing of long-term funding
instruments in connection with Brexit.

Anticipated performance of Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft

The banking environment remained very challenging in 2018, but
Commerzbank made further progress towards achieving a sustain-
able, higher level of profitability in the medium term with the help
of the Commerzbank 4.0 strategy. In 2019, the focus will remain
on further growth in customer numbers and business volumes,
and thus on income in both of the core business areas, Private and
Small-Business Customers and Corporate Clients. One key to a
sustainably improved market position is the continued digital
transformation of the business model, which is being pursued with
considerable investment. The overall conditions for the German
banking sector this year look set to remain very challenging. The
low/negative interest rate environment will continue to weigh on
profitability, as will the intensity of competition, with margins on
new lending business at an unsatisfactory level in some cases. We
think a normalisation of interest rates that would allow to acceler-
ate the desired medium term improvements in income and earn-
ings is unlikely to occur in 2019. Our main focus this year will be
on increasing client-related income, in other words we are antici-
pating a good quality of income and earnings.

As the Bank is managed via its segments, the information in the
following sections of the outlook and opportunities report is
geared towards the performance of the Commerzbank Group as a
whole. We expect to see the following developments in 2019:

Anticipated performance of individual earnings components
Even though we assume the interest rate environment will remain
difficult, Commerzbank is aiming for a slight increase in net inter-
est income as the most important source of income. The planned
further growth in credit volume will make an important contribu-
tion to this. As in past years, Commerzbank intends to strive for
growth with middle-market customers that is higher than the mar-
ket, especially in the Private and Small-Business Customers seg-
ment, but also in the Corporate Clients segment. However, owing
to the persistently high pressure on margins in Germany as a re-
sult of competition, we assume that the growth in income will be
disproportionately less than the volume increase. The targeted
growth combined with efficient as-
set/liability management, should make it possible to increase in-
come in the deposits business again after several years of decline.
All in all, we still see sizable growth potential in the private, small-
business and corporate customer business both for Commerzbank
in Germany as well as at mBank.

in customer deposits,


--- Page 38 ---

We expect net commission income to be largely stable this
year. In the absence of any periods of excess volatility on the fi-
nancial markets, which normally harm customer activity, a slight
increase is possible. Growth potential remains in both core busi-
ness areas, Private and Small-Business Customers and Corporate
Clients, especially in securities and capital markets business. With
private customers, higher portfolio-related income from mandated
transactions and in wealth management, combined with an antici-
pated market related rise in custody account volumes, should re-
sult in higher commission income. With institutional and corporate
customers, commission business should develop positively, in part
due to increased activity in the primary and secondary markets.

In terms of net income from financial assets and liabilities at
fair value through profit and loss, the risk-oriented and client-
focused approach at Commerzbank means the objective remains
to achieve a contribution to earnings that is as stable as possible.
It is hard to make a forecast, however, given the uncertainties over
the performance and volatility on global capital markets. For the
ship finance portfolio which moved to fair value measurement in
line with IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 Commerzbank assumes that by
the end of 2019 the remaining holdings will have essentially been
reduced in full with no material impact on earnings.

Experience has shown that the other income items, including
realised profit or losses on financial instruments and other net in-
come, are often affected by one-off income and measurement ef-
fects, which are hard to forecast. Given the relatively low level of
such non-recurring income items in 2018, we assume there will be
no material change to them overall in 2019.

The overall forecast trend in operating income, especially net
interest income, is based on the assumption that interest rates will
remain low. If rates look set to rise, especially at the short end of
the yield curve, we feel it is realistic that the expected improve-
ments in income could be considerably accelerated.

Despite the transfer of a consumer financing portfolio with high
expected risk costs onto the bank’s own books, the risk result had
a considerably smaller impact in 2018 than originally anticipated.
We do not expect loan impairments in 2019 to be on a level com-
parable to last year (i.e. exceptionally low). Even so, the risk result
of at least €550m anticipated in the baseline scenario reflects a
favourable level by historical standards. Even in a somewhat weak-
er economic environment, Commerzbank will in our view continue
to benefit from good risk management in both new lending and
dealing with problem loans.

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

Also, with respect to the three stages under IFRS 9, we again
anticipate a similar picture to last year, when non-performing
loans accounted for most of the loan loss provisions. The expecta-
tion of above-average portfolio quality is reflected in our forecast
that also in the current year only a relatively small share of the risk
result is likely to relate to value losses caused by a significant de-
terioration of credit quality, known as phase 2 impairments. Under
IFRS 9, expected lifetime losses must be taken through profit and
loss in the risk result when credit exposures suffer a material rat-
ing deterioration.

Operating expenses in 2019 should remain lower than the past
year. The planned cost base of less than €6.8bn should allow fur-
ther investment to boost future profitability and also cover the ex-
pected ongoing high level of regulatory costs. We expect increas-
ing cost relief from the efficiency improvement measures already
implemented and still to come, such as the digitalisation offensive
in all areas of the Group, although much of this is only scheduled
to become visible in subsequent years.

Anticipated segment performance

In the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, rising cus-
tomer numbers and business volumes, especially in Germany, re-
main the main driver for the targeted slight improvement in total
operating income. The segment expects growing scope for income
from improved penetration of the existing customer base by apply-
ing data-based analysis tools efficiently; customers will be offered
customised banking offerings to suit each stage of their lifecycle.
As the move to a multi-channel bank proceeds, over time it will be
possible to conclude the full product range over all channels, so
customers will ultimately have unlimited choice between online,
mobile or branch distribution channels. We see the ongoing digi-
talisation of products and processes, combined with innovative
branch and distribution concepts, as a competitive advantage
which we expect to provide further growth potential. We are aim-
ing for further significant volume growth in lending, to counter the
persistently unfavourable interest rate and competitive environ-
ment and the resultant margin pressure. New business in higher-
margin consumer loans should grow particularly strongly in 2019,
supported by increased use of online sales channels. The aim in
real estate financing is to at least maintain the considerably im-
proved market position attained in recent years. Third-party sales,
being connected more efficiently to Commerzbank systems
through the application programming interface (APD), will play an
increased role here.

Higher income is also expected from corporate customers fol-
lowing the completion last autumn of the transfer of small and
medium-sized customers with annual turnover of less than €15m

from the Corporate Clients segment to the Private and Small-
Business Customers segment. Business volumes should be in-
creased by better coverage, especially as regards operational is-
sues. The broad range of services for small
includes, for example, leasing offerings and innovative digital so-
lutions for liquidity management. We expect our Polish subsidiary
mBank, which operates what is acknowledged to be one of the
most innovative direct banking platforms in Europe, to maintain its
growth path. Given the steady expansion of the market position in
recent years in both corporate and private customer banking, we
expect further improvements in business volume and adjusted in-
come at mBank. In addition to higher income, efficiency gains
should make an increasing contribution to improving operating
earnings in the whole Private and Small-Business Customers seg-
ment. The advanced expansion of the central ONE distribution

business customers

platform in Germany will result in significant process optimisa-
tions and thus better cost efficiency, as will the trend towards less
product diversity. The product range will become increasingly dig-
ital and thereby create additional benefits for clients. As a result,
operating expenses should remain stable or decline slightly de-
spite an ongoing high anticipated burden from regulatory costs.
The sharp increase predicted in the risk result for the Private and
Small-Business Customers segment as a whole is primarily related
to the higher volume of loans expected in Germany. Instalment
loans in particular require significantly higher impairments, but
experience shows these are covered by the considerably higher
credit margin. Although we assume that the low level of risk costs,
which is to an extent unusual, cannot be sustained, we remain
confident that given the high quality of the loan portfolio, it will

prove robust even in a less favourable economic environment.

Overall, we anticipate a significant increase in operating profit in
the Private and Small-Business Customers segment in 2019.
ightly higher income combined with slightly lower operating
expenses and a small rise in the risk result should also considera-
bly improve the operating return on equity. There is likely to be a
considerable drop in the cost/income ratio.

In the Corporate Clients segment, too, the focus is on growth
initiatives aimed at modestly increasing income by further
strengthening and improving the market position, which is that of
leader in many areas. In Germany, the aim is to leverage potential,
especially among SMEs with turnover in the range of €15m to
€100m, on the one hand by winning further customers and, on the
other, by applying a new advisory model and data-supported
needs analysis that will make it possible to tap into existing cus-
tomers better. In international business, the segment positions
itself as a eurobank focused on fast-growing regions such as the
USA and China. With the aim of also broadening the customer
base, it can build on the strong competitive position in trade fi-
nancing, for example, and euro payments, and benefit from out-
standing sector and corporate finance expertise. A further focus of
segment activities in the current year will remain the digital trans-
formation of the advisory and distribution processes. The ongoing
digitalisation goes hand in hand with the further major expansion
of the ability to do business online across the whole product
range. The segment expects that exploiting increasing efficiency
gains over time will lead to a slight reduction in operating expens-
es year on year. The forecast of a considerably higher risk result in
the current year is based on lower expected reversals of loan im-
pairments, which had a large favourable impact on the prior-year
figure. Based on the fundamental assumption of no major weaken-
ing in the overall economic environment, we expect portfolio qual-
ity to remain robust both in Germany and abroad. Overall, in 2019
the Corporate Clients segment should achieve operating profit that
is at least stable or slightly higher, with a slight improvement in
the cost/income ratio. We expect the operating return on equity to
be essentially unchanged.

We are forecasting that by the end of 2019 the size of the port-
folio in the Asset & Capital Recovery segment will have been sub-
stantially reduced compared to the end of 2018. We are confident
that we will manage to once again cut the remaining positions in
shipping loans and commercial real estate financing considerably
during the course of the year. We are also targeting a major reduc-
tion in Public Finance. Current income in the ACR segment will fall
sharply this year in both absolute and relative terms in line with
the size of the portfolio. The future performance of the ACR seg-
ment will continue to be dominated by measurement gains or
losses, which experience has shown are hard to forecast reliably.
In the baseline scenario, total revenue in 2019 will again fall below
zero, although not by much, since, like in 2018, no significant bur-
den is expected from the shipping portfolio, which is measured at
fair value through profit and loss. We also forecast only a small
risk result for the commercial real estate financing portfolio. Over-
all, we assume the Asset & Capital Recovery segment will post an
operating profit significantly below the past year’s figure, with op-

erating expenses substantially lower again.

General statement on the outlook for the Group

The Bank will continue to systematically implement the Commerz-
bank 4.0 strategy in 2019. Our forecasts for the rest of the year
assume neither a trend in interest rates that would positively affect
profitability nor any relaxation in the competitive environment. It
is highly likely that margin pressure will persist in both private and
corporate customer business, as maturing loans with higher inter-
est rates can generally only be replaced with new business at low-
er rates. Commerzbank is forecasting slightly higher income over-
all for the current financial year, operating expenses below €6.8bn
and a significantly higher risk result. This will result in a slight rise
in operating profit; the cost/income ratio should improve slightly.
We anticipate a minor but perceptible burden from items that do
not contribute to operating profit, largely attributable to profit or
loss from discontinued operations, which includes the contribution
from the former Equity Markets & Commodities division. Overall,
we expect a slight increase in consolidated net profit. As a result,
we see both the return on equity and economic value added rising
to a slightly higher level. In terms of the Common Equity Tier 1
ratio (fully phased-in), in future Commerzbank will focus more
closely on the capital requirements arising from the Supervisory
Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). At the end of 2018, the
regulator, the European Central Bank (ECB), praised the progress
made by Commerzbank in improving its risk profile. Consequently,
it set the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio resulting from the
SREP one-quarter of a percentage point lower for 2019. The suc-
cess in reducing risks and the size of the balance sheet in recent
years has also resulted in the German regulator leaving the capital
buffer for other systematically important institutions (O-SIIs) at
1.0% for 2019, delaying the increase to 1.5% which had been
planned. Our own ambition for the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at
the end of 2019 is at least 12.75%. This figure is well above the
ECB regulatory requirement and in management's opinion it in-
cludes a sufficient buffer to cover potential stress situations. We
ally report a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio
below our 12.75% target, probably in the first half of the year. The
implementation of new accounting standards and the anticipated
impact of regulatory measures are likely to push the ratio down
temporarily, before a steady improvement over the course of the
year is seen towards the target figure.

Based on our current estimates, we anticipate that the net prof-
it in Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s parent company financial
statements in 2019 will be slightly higher than in 2018. We aim to
propose a dividend for 2019 at a level comparable to that for 2018.

Despite the steady improvement in resilience to external influ-
ences in recent years, numerous risk factors are present that could
affect the forecast profit for 2019 to a considerable, though not
reliably quantifiable, extent should events take an unfavourable

assume that we will i

turn. Among these are the highly uncertain geopolitical situation
and increased global economic risks, including in the core region
for Commerzbank, Europe. Here we see looming trade disputes

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

and the currently unpredictable outcome of the Brexit process
having a considerable impact. Difficulties related to the normalisa-
tion of monetary policy over time and the end to the unconven-
tional central bank measures, which is desired by most central
banks, caused short, sharp price corrections and a leap in volatility
on the capital markets at the end of 2018. Valuation levels remain
high by historical standards on both international equity and bond
markets. The economic situation is fundamentally positive, but if
this were to darken significantly it could hit Germany's interna-
tionally connected economy particularly hard and result in risk
costs much higher than expected. Other risk factors include unfa-
vourable trends in the regulatory or legal environment, which
could delay the impact of the intended cost improvements, and a
further tightening of the competitive situation in Germany. If mar-
gins were to fall further to levels that are unattractive from a
risk/return perspective, _ this considerably

Risk-oriented overall bank management

Commerzbank defines risk as the danger of possible losses or
profits foregone due to internal or external factors. In risk man-
agement, we normally distinguish between quantifiable and non-
quantifiable types of risk. Quantifiable risks are those to which a
value can normally be attached in financial statements or in regu-
latory capital requirements, while non-quantifiable risks include
compliance and reputational risk.

Risk management organisation

Commerzbank regards risk management as a task for the whole
Bank. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible for developing
and implementing the Group’s risk policy guidelines for quanti-
fiable risks, laid down by the Board of Managing Directors, as well
as for measuring these risks. The CRO regularly reports to the full

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board’s Risk
Committee on the overall risk situation within the Group.

The risk management organisation comprises Credit Risk
Management, Intensive Care, Market Risk Management as well as
Risk Controlling and Capital Management. In all segments except
for Asset & Capital Recovery (ACR), credit risk management is
separated into a performing loan area and Intensive Care, while
in ACR it has been merged into a single unit across all rating
classes. All divisions have a direct reporting line to the CRO.

It is Group Compliance’s responsibility to establish appropriate
governance, procedures and systems to avoid the Bank being un-
intentionally endangered as a consequence of compliance risks.
This includes the risks associated with money laundering, terrorist
financing, sanctions and embargoes, markets compliance, and
fraud and corruption. Group Compliance is led by the Chief Com-
pliance Officer, who reports directly to the member of the Board of
Managing Directors with responsibility for Group Compliance.

The full Board of Managing Directors has exclusive responsibi-
lity for fundamental strategic decisions. The Board of Managing
Directors has delegated operative risk management to commit-
tees. Under the relevant rules of procedure, these are the Group
Credit Committee, the Group Market Risk Committee, the Group
OpRisk Committee and the Group Strategic Risk Committee,
which decides on risk issues of an overarching nature. The CRO
chairs all these committees and has the right of veto. The CRO is
also a member of the central Asset Liability Committee.

The tasks and competencies of the respective committees are
described below:

The Group Credit Committee is the decision-making com-
mittee for operative credit risk management, comprising two rep-
resentatives each from the back office and front office. The Group
Credit Committee operates on the basis of the credit risk strategy.
It takes decisions in line with the competencies delegated to it by
the full Board of Managing Directors.

The Group Market Risk Committee monitors market risk
throughout the Bank and manages limit requirements in line with

risk-bearing capacity. To do this, all market risks from the trading
and banking book are analysed to identify risks early and for active
risk management purposes. The focus here is on optimising the
risk/return profile.

The Group OpRisk Committee (OpRiskCo) is responsible for
managing operational risks within the Group and in this regard
acts as the highest escalation and decision-making committee be-
low the full Board of Managing Directors. The OpRiskCo also ad-
dresses all important regulatory issues that arise in connection
with the management of operational risks and the implementation
of the advanced measurement approach within the Group. In addi-
tion, it deals with standards on governance and assessing the func-
tioning of the Internal Control System (ICS) within the Commerz-
bank Group. Details about the ICS can be found in the section on
operational risks.

The Group Strategic Risk Committee acts as the discussion
and decision-making committee for all types of risk, and its main
objective is to monitor and manage risks at portfolio level. This
covers risk measurement, risk transparency and risk management.

The central Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is the Commerz-
bank Group committee responsible for the Group-wide and inte-
grated management of financial resources, namely capital, liquidity
and balance sheet structure as well as net interest income, in
accordance with the regulatory framework. The ALCO monitors in
particular the Group’s risk-bearing capacity and as such plays an
important part in the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Pro-
cess (ICAAP). The ALCO resolves the recovery plan (resolutions of
the central ALCO are presented to the full Board of Managing
Directors for confirmation). In case of violation of a recovery plan
indicator, the ALCO plays a central role regarding the escalation,
the estimation of the situation and the introduction of measures.

Moreover, risk issues are dealt with in the Supervisory Board's
Risk Committee and in the Risk & Analytics Executive Committee:

The Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee is the Bank’s high-
est risk committee. It comprises at least five Supervisory Board
members. The Risk Committee’s tasks include monitoring the risk
management system and dealing with all risks, particularly with
regard to market, credit and operational risk as well as reputation-
al risk. The Risk Committee determines the type, scope, format
and frequency of the information that must be presented to the
Board of Managing Directors about strategy and risk.

The Risk & Analytics Executive Committee is the discussion
and decision-making committee within the risk function and Big
Data & Advanced Analytics. It is responsible in particular for the
organisation and strategic development of risk management and
for creating and maintaining a uniform risk culture. It also ensures
that the Group risk strategy and the resolutions of the full Board of
Managing Directors are implemented in the risk function.

Risk strategy and risk management

The overall risk strategy, in line with the business strategy, gov-
erns the strategic risk focus of the Commerzbank Group. It sets
the risk appetite as the maximum risk that the Bank is prepared
and able to accept while following its business objectives without
exposing itself to existential threats over and above the risks in-
herent in the business. The guiding idea is to ensure that the
Group holds sufficient liquidity and capital. Based on these
requirements, suitable limits are defined for the risk resources of
capital and liquidity available to the Group. The overarching lim-
its of the overall risk strategy are consistent with the indicator
thresholds of the recovery plan.

Banks’ core functions as transformers of liquidity and risk
result in inevitable threats that can in extreme cases endanger the
continued existence of the institution. For Commerzbank, in view
of its business model, these inherent existential threats include
the default of Germany, Poland, one or more of the other major

EU countries (France, Italy, Spain or the UK, although Brexit is
not deemed to be a default) or the default of the USA. Italy is an
idiosyncratic special case due to the major legacy exposures to
the Italian government, while in the other countries existential
threats would arise from the impact of a government default on
banks and companies and the repercussions for the other EU
countries. Others include a deep recession lasting several years
with serious repercussions for the German economy, a bank run
and the collapse of global clearing houses or the foreign exchange
markets, possibly triggered by a cyber attack. In general, cyber
risk is an inherent, existential threat for Commerzbank in the con-
text of increasing digitalisation in the business environment.

When pursuing its business targets, the Bank accepts these exis-
tential threats. It may be necessary to adjust the business model and
hence the business and risk strategies in the medium and long term
if the full Board of Managing Directors’ assessment of these threats
to Commerzbank changes substantially. To the extent that it is able
to do so, Commerzbank makes early preparations in anticipation of
forthcoming changes in regulatory requirements and accounting
standards. Such changes and their (retrospective) interpretation may
have lasting implications for — and even threaten the survival of —
Commerzbank’s business model. Commerzbank accepts these regu-
latory risks because there are many cases where there is no option
to mitigate or manage them.

The overall risk strategy covers all material risks to which
Commerzbank is exposed. It is updated annually or on an ad hoc
basis as required and set out in further detail in the form of sub-
risk strategies for the risk types which are material. These are
then specified and made operational through policies, regulations
and instructions/guidelines. By means of the upstream risk inven-
tory process, Commerzbank ensures that all risk types of rele-
vance to the Group are identified and their materiality assessed.
The assessment of the materiality of a risk is based on whether its
occurrence could have a major direct or indirect impact on the
Bank’s risk-bearing capacity.

As part of the planning process, the Board of Managing Direc-
tors decides how much of the risk coverage potential of the Group
should be utilised. On that basis, individual types of quantifiable
risk contributing to the capital requirements are limited in a sec-
ond stage. A capital framework is allocated to the management-
relevant units through the planning process. Compliance with lim-
its and guidelines is monitored during the year, and management
measures are put in place where required. In addition, further
qualitative and quantitative early warning indicators are estab-
lished in the overall risk strategy. Potential negative developments
can be identified at an early stage with the help of these indicators.



--- Page 44 ---

One of the primary tasks of risk management is the avoidance
of risk concentrations. These can arise from the synchronous
movement of risk positions both within a single risk type (intra-
risk concentrations) and across different risk types (inter-risk con-
centrations). The latter result from common risk drivers or from
interactions between different risk drivers of different risk types.

By establishing adequate risk management and controlling pro-
cesses, Commerzbank provides for the identification, assessment,
management, monitoring and communication of material risks and
related risk concentrations. This ensures that all Commerzbank-
specific risk concentrations are taken into account in its risk man-
agement. Stress tests are regularly used to ensure transparency
regarding risk concentrations. The structure of the scenarios and
the integrated approach ensure that the impact of adverse scena-
rios on portfolio priorities and risk concentrations are examined in
a targeted manner. Management is regularly informed about the
results of the analyses so that the potential risk of losses can be
avoided in good time.

The Group Risk & Capital Monitor is the monthly risk report,
designed for management purposes, on capital, credit risk, market
risk, liquidity risk and OpRisk topics within Commerzbank risk
management. It shows all the above risk types, including eco-
nomic and regulatory risk-bearing capacity, for the Commerzbank
Group. The report's aims include providing the full Board of Man-
aging Directors and the Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee with
transparent and comprehensive information, highlighting im-
portant developments from a risk perspective and setting man-
agement measures. The report is also used in particular to monitor
limits and guidelines within the overall risk strategy. Responsibility
for approving the overall risk strategy and the Group Risk & Capi-
tal Monitor lies with the full Board of Managing Directors.

Commerzbank has adopted a code of conduct that defines
binding minimum standards for Commerzbank’s corporate respon-
sibility, its dealings with customers, business partners and col-
leagues, and its day-to-day business. It goes without saying that
the Bank complies with relevant laws, regulatory requirements,
industry standards and internal rules, and this therefore forms a
particularly important part of its risk culture. It actively requires
employees to behave appropriately, courageously, with integrity
and in compliance with rules, and any failure to comply with rules
is penalised. Expanded procedures ensure that misconduct is
evaluated in a uniform and fair manner, strengthening conse-
quence management on a long-term basis.

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

The main pillar of the Bank’s overall risk management and cul-
ture is the concept of three lines of defence, which is a core ele-
ment of the Corporate Charter. Under the three lines of defence
principle, protecting against undesirable risks is an activity that is
not restricted to the risk function. Each unit (segment or function)
forms the first line of defence within its area of operational re-
sponsibility and is responsible for identifying and managing risks
within it while complying with the prescribed risk standards and
policies. For example, the front office forms the first line of de-
fence in all business decisions and has to take risk aspects into
account in reaching them. The second line of defence for each
type of risk lays down standards for appropriate management of
risks of that type, monitors this and ensures the application of
such standards, and analyses and evaluates the risks. The risk
function forms the second line of defence against credit and mar-
ket risks associated with business decisions. Particularly for credit
risk, this includes involvement in the credit decision process by
means of a second vote. Units outside the risk function (e.g. Group
Compliance and Group Finance) also operate as the second line of
defence for certain risk types. The third line of defence is internal
audit.

Risk ratios

Commerzbank uses a comprehensive system of ratios and proce-
dures for measuring, managing and limiting various types of risk.
The most important of these are listed below:

Economically required capital is the amount, corresponding to
a high confidence level (currently 99.91% at Commerzbank), that
will cover unexpected losses arising from risk positions.

The risk-bearing capacity ratio (RBC ratio) indicates the
excess coverage of the economically required capital by the risk
coverage potential. Risk-bearing capacity is deemed to be as-
sured as long as the RBC ratio is higher than 100%.

Exposure at default (EaD) is the expected exposure amount
taking into account a potential (partial) drawing of open lines and
contingent liabilities that will adversely affect risk-bearing capacity
in the event of default. EaD is hereinafter also referred to as
“exposure”.

Expected loss (EL) measures the potential loss on a loan port-
folio that can be expected within one year on the basis of historical
loss data.

Risk density is the ratio of expected loss to exposure at default
and thus represents the relative risk content of an exposure or a
portfolio.

47

Value at risk (VaR) is a methodology for quantifying risk. It in-
volves setting a holding period (such as one day) and a confidence
level (such as 97.5%). The VaR value then denotes the relevant
loss threshold that will not be exceeded within the holding period
with a probability in line with the confidence level.

Credit value at risk (CVaR) is the economic capital require-
ment for credit risk with a confidence level of 99.91%. The
term results from the application of the value at risk concept to
credit risk measurement. Credit VaR is an estimate of the amount
by which losses from credit risks could potentially exceed the
expected loss within a single year, ie. unexpected loss. The idea
behind this approach is that expected loss simply represents the
long-term average of lending losses, but this may vary (positively
or negatively) from actual credit losses for the current financial
year.

In relation to bulk risk, the “all-in concept comprises all cus-
tomer credit lines approved by the Bank in their full amount - irre-
spective of the loan utilisation to date. It is independent of statisti-
cally modelled parameters to the greatest possible extent and
comprises internal as well as external credit lines.

Risk-bearing capacity and stress testing

Risk-bearing capacity analysis is a key part of overall bank manage-
ment and Commerzbank’s ICAAP. The purpose is to ensure that
sufficient capital is held at all times.

Commerzbank monitors risk-bearing capacity using a gone con-
cern approach which seeks primarily to protect unsubordinated
lenders. This objective should be achieved even in the event of
extraordinarily high losses from an unlikely extreme event. The
gone concern analysis is supplemented here by elements aimed at
ensuring the institution’s continuing existence (going concern
perspective).

When determining the economically required capital, allow-
ance is made for potential unexpected fluctuations in value. Where
such fluctuations exceed forecasts, they must be covered by the
available economic capital to absorb unexpected losses (risk cov-
erage potential). The quantification of the risk coverage potential
is based on a differentiated view of the accounting values of assets
and liabilities and involves economic valuations of certain balance
sheet items.

The capital requirement for the risks taken is quantified using
the internal economic capital model. When assessing the econom-
ic capital required, allowance is made for all the types of risk at

the Commerzbank Group that are classified as material and quanti-
fiable in the annual risk inventory. The economic risk approach
therefore also comprises risk types that are not included in the
regulatory requirements for banks’ capital adequacy. The model
also reflects diversification effects incorporating all types of risk.
The confidence level of 99.91% in the economic capital model is
in line with the underlying gone concern assumptions and ensures
the economic risk-bearing capacity concept is internally consistent.
The quantifiable risks in the economic capital model can be divid-
ed into default risk, market risk, operational risk and (although not
shown separately in the table on page 49) business risk, physical
asset risk, investment portfolio risk, deposit model risk and reserve
risk. Business risk is the risk of a loss resulting from discrepancies
between actual income and expense and the respective budgeted
figures. Business risk is considered as a deductible amount in risk
coverage potential. Investment portfolio risk indicates the risk of
an unexpected fall in the value of unlisted investments. Physical
asset risk is the risk of an unexpected fall in the value of owned
property which is either already recognised as an asset in the
Group’s balance sheet or which can be recognised during the next
12 months under contractually assured obligations with option
character (especially real estate). Deposit model risk is the risk
arising from the deposit model used by Commerzbank and from
modelling unscheduled repayment rights in commercial credit
business. Reserve risk is the risk of additional charges being in-
curred on the portfolio of loans already in default through the cre-
ation of additional loan loss provisions. Allowance is made for
this risk by means of a risk buffer when considering risk-bearing
capacity. The results of the risk-bearing capacity analysis are
shown using the risk-bearing capacity ratio (RBC ratio), indicat-
ing the excess of the risk coverage potential in relation to the
economically required capital.

The risk-bearing capacity is monitored and managed monthly
at Group level. Risk-bearing capacity is deemed to be assured as
long as the RBC ratio is higher than 100%. In 2018, the RBC ratio
was consistently above 100% and stood at 193% on 31 December
2018. The decline in the RBC ratio is attributable to the change in
the risk coverage potential, which fell compared with December
2017 due mainly to the introduction of IFRS 9, time-to-maturity
effects of subordinated capital and the market-related develop-
ments in the Public Finance portfolio. The RBC ratio remains at a
high level.

Commerzbank uses macroeconomic stress tests to review the
risk-bearing capacity in the event of assumed adverse changes in
the economic environment. The scenarios on which they are
based take into account the interdependence in development be-
tween the real and financial economies and extend over a time
horizon of at least two years. They are updated quarterly and
approved by the ALCO. The scenarios describe an extraordinary
but plausible adverse development in the economy, focusing in
particular on portfolio priorities (e.g. export-based sectors in
Germany) and business strategies of relevance to Commerzbank.
The scenario simulation is run monthly at Group level using the
input parameters of the economic capital requirements calculation
for all material and quantifiable risk types. In addition to the capi-
tal required, the income statement is also subjected to a stress test
based on the macroeconomic scenarios. Based on this, changes in
the risk coverage potential are simulated. Whereas the RBC ratio is
embedded into Commerzbank’s limit system, guidelines for risk-
bearing capacity are set as an early warning system in the stressed
environment. The ongoing monitoring of the limits and guidelines
is a key part of internal reporting. Defined escalations are trig-
gered if the limits are breached.

The risk-bearing capacity and stress testing concept is subject
to an annual internal review and is refined on an ongoing basis.
The development of the regulatory environment is also taken into
account. The European Central Bank (ECB) published revised
ICAAP and ILAAP guidelines on 9 November 2018. Commerzbank
will adjust its risk-bearing capacity and stress testing concept to
comply with the new requirements from 2019. This will involve
changing the economic approach from a gone concern approach
to a going concern approach. In addition to the regular stress
tests, reverse stress tests are implemented annually at Group level.
Unlike regular stress testing, the result of the simulation — a sus-
tained threat to the Bank — is determined in advance. The aim of
the analysis process in the reverse stress test is to improve the
transparency of Bank-specific risk potential and interactions of risk
by identifying and assessing extreme scenarios and events. On this
basis, for instance, action fields in risk management including the

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

regular stress tests can be identified and taken into account in the
ongoing development efforts.

In addition to its own internal stress test of economic risk-
bearing capacity, Commerzbank once again took part in the EU-
wide stress test conducted by the European Banking Authority
(EBA), achieving a significantly better result than in the previous
stress test in 2016. Under the adverse stress scenario the com-
mon equity tier one (CET1) ratio was 9.9% at the end of the
review period in 2020. That is 2.5 percentage points higher than
in the last test in 2016. Overall, the stress effect reduced the CET
1 ratio by 3.4 percentage points from 13.3% (full application of
Basel 3 including the new IFRS 9 accounting rules as at year-end
2017/ 2018). In 2016, the ratio fell by 4.7 percentage points under
the adverse stress scenario.

In 2018, the risk-weighted assets resulting from Commerz-
bank’s business activities increased from €171bn to €180bn.

The increase was mainly attributable to volume growth in the
Private and Small-Business Customers and Corporate Clients
segments. RWA also increased as a result of parameter adjust-
ments, partially offset by the planned reduction of the Asset &
Capital Recovery portfolio.

The table below gives an overview of the distribution of risk-
weighted assets, broken down by segment and risk type:

Regulatory environment
With Basel 3, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision pub-

lished among other things comprehensive rules on the compo-
nents of shareholders’ equity and ratios as well as the manage-
ment of liquidity risk. The Capital Requirements Directive and
Regulation (CRD-IV) package of measures, constituting the Euro-
pean implementation of Basel 3, has been in force since 1 January
2014, with the more stringent capital requirements being phased
in up to 2019. Numerous supplementary regulations have since
been published by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in par-
ticular, and these will now gradually enter into force; this will con-
tinue in subsequent years. Commerzbank has prepared itself for
the more stringent capital adequacy requirements by taking a
number of steps.

49

In addition, under Basel 3 the leverage ratio has been intro-
duced as a new and non-risk-sensitive debt ratio. Commerzbank
has set its own leverage ratio targets and applies them in its capi-
tal management process.

The phasing in of capital buffers is a significant feature of the Ba-
sel 3 revision. The capital conservation buffer, the buffer for other
systemically relevant institutions and the countercyclical capital
buffer, which the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)
has again set at 0% for German exposure for the fourth quarter of
2018, have applied since 1 January 2016. The buffer for other sys-
temically relevant institutions was set by BaFin for Commerzbank at
1% for 2018.

Liquidity risk is to be monitored by means of the liquidity cov-
erage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The LCR
entered into force on 1 October 2015 and is binding on all Europe-
an banks. The final version of the NSFR, which was approved by
the Basel Committee in October 2014, is due to be transposed into
European law as part of the Capital Requirements Regulation II
(CRR ID). Commerzbank is already calculating both ratios as part of
its regulatory reporting processes, communicating them in its in-
ternal reporting and reporting them to the supervisory authority.

The ECB, in its capacity as the supervisory authority for the
eurozone banks directly supervised by it, has conducted the Super-
visory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) and specified individ-
ual minimum capital requirements for each bank.

The aim of the ECB’s targeted review of internal models (TRIM)
is to harmonise the RWA-relevant models for market, counterparty
and credit risk that fall within the scope of the Single Supervisory
Mechanism (SSM). In particular, the scope for interpretation per-
mitted by the regulations or arising due to differences in national
application is to be significantly reduced in future. The relevant
guides include rules that are to be enacted in future and wide-
ranging independent interpretations. In 2018, reviews focused in
particular on low default portfolios. The decision regarding the
TRIM assessment in 2017 will be prepared by the ECB in 2019.
This may result in higher risk-weighted assets.

The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive has been in
force since mid-2014. It was transposed into German law in the
form of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Act (Sanierungs- und
Abwicklungsgesetz, SAG). Based on this law, the Financial Mar-

ket Stabilisation Authority (FMSA), as the national resolution
authority, took over responsibility for the drafting of resolution
plans and the resolution of German banks with effect from
1 January 2015. Responsibility for the drafting of resolution plans
and the resolution of at-risk banks supervised by the ECB was
transferred to the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Brussels with
effect from 1 January 2016. At the same time, eurozone banks
started to fund the Single Resolution Fund. In 2018, the SRB de-
fined a first formal minimum requirement for own funds and eli-
gible liabilities (MREL) for the banks under its responsi
consolidated basis.

lity on a

The Group-wide recovery plan was updated in 2018 to reflect
the regulatory requirements. The recovery plan describes in detail
for instance the courses of action and recovery potential available
to the Bank in the event of a crisis and which specific recovery
measures, in various stress scenarios, will enable the Bank to
complete its recovery. As the European and German regulations
and requirements are finalised, the Bank will refine its recovery
plan accordingly.

Commerzbank operates in markets subject to national and
supranational regulation. In addition, it is subject to the over-
arching requirements imposed by accounting standards. Changes
in regulatory requirements and accounting standards have signi-
ficantly grown in frequency and materiality in recent years. They
may have lasting implications for the financial industry in general
and Commerzbank’s business model in particular. Commerzbank
participates actively and at an early stage in the consultation pro-
cesses aimed at preparing for the constant changes in the operat-
ing environment. It also monitors and evaluates current develop-
ments as regards future regulatory projects. Specific examples of
these at global level are the final standards for revising capital
requirements for market risk now published by the Basel Commit-
tee on Banking Supervision, the rules on interest rate risks in the
banking book and revision of the framework for operational risks
and credit risks, including the associated floor rules and disclo-
sure requirements. At European level, Commerzbank is monitor-
ing the European Commission initiatives to introduce a European
deposit insurance scheme and establish a capital markets union,
and in particular the associated EU securitisation framework.

Default risk

Default risk is defined as the risk of losses sustained or profits
foregone due to the default of a counterparty. It is a quantifiable
material risk and includes the material sub-risk types of credit
default risk, issuer risk, counterparty risk, country and transfer
risk, dilution risk and reserve risk.

Strategy and organisation

The credit risk strategy is the sub-risk strategy for default risks
and is derived from the overall risk strategy. It is embedded in the
ICAAP process of the Commerzbank Group and forms a link be-
tween the Bank’s overall risk management across all risk types and
the operationalisation of default risk management. The overriding
aim is to ensure the adequate quality of the credit portfolio. To this
end, the credit risk strategy defines the credit risk tolerance, speci-
fies risk strategy priorities, provides an overview of the material
credit risk management concepts and thereby plays an integral
part in maintaining the Group’s risk-bearing capacity. The credit
risk strategy makes use of quantitative and qualitative manage-
ment tools that give decision-makers clear guidance on both port-
folio management and decisions in specific cases.

Commerzbank’s underwriting practices are governed by its Cor-
porate Clients Loan Underwriting Policy, which addresses amongst
other things, loan origination, underwriting criteria, as well as the
credit decision process. Furthermore, the Loan Underwriting Policy
is interlinked with the bank’s credit risk strategy and credit policies.

Credit risk management is a joint task of the front office and
the risk function, based on a standardised Group-wide credit risk
culture. Impeccable moral and ethical conduct in compliance with
the law and regulations is a key element of a culture of integrity
and core to the credit risk culture. Default risks are assessed
against uniform standards, regardless of segment limits. In line
with the three lines of defence principle, the front office is the first
line of defence and must take risk aspects into account when tak-
ing business decisions. The risk function (back office and Risk
Controlling) is the second line of defence, its fundamental task
being to manage, limit and monitor risks. The third line of defence
is Internal Audit. It is tasked with independently auditing the
Bank's processes and safe guards, and as such also assesses the
activities of the first and second lines of defence.

The Group Credit Committee is the highest decision-making
committee for operative credit risk management, comprising two
representatives each from the back office and front office. It takes
decisions in line with the competencies delegated to it by the full
Board of Managing Directors and is responsible for managing all
credit risks. In so doing, the Group Credit Committee operates on
the basis of the valid credit risk strategy. Reporting to the Group
Credit Committee are sub-credit committees, which operate on the

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

basis of their respective rules of procedure and within the compe-
tencies approved by the full Board of Managing Directors. They
comprise at least two representatives from the segments and two
representatives from Group Risk Management. The sub-credit
committees are responsible for managing all credit risks in the
sub-portfolios within their respective remit and are entitled, in
turn, to sub-delegate certain credit decisions within their pre-
scribed competencies.

Discrete back-office areas are responsible for operational credit
risk management at portfolio level and on a case-by-case basis. The
responsibilities are separated between the performing loan area on
the one hand and Intensive Care on the other. All credit decisions in
the performing loan area are risk/return decisions. The front and
back office take joint responsibility for risk and return from an
exposure, with the front office having primary responsibility for the
return, and the back office for the risk. Accordingly, neither office
can be overruled in its primary responsibility in the credit decision
process.

Higher-risk customers in Corporate Clients and Private and
Small-Business Customers are handled by specialist Intensive Care
areas. The customers are moved to these areas as soon as they
meet defined criteria for assignment or mandatory transfer. The
principal reasons for assignment to Intensive Care areas are crite-
ria relating to number of days overdrawn, together with event-
related criteria such as rating, third-party enforcement measures
or credit fraud. Intensive Care decides on further action based on
the circumstances of individual cases. Customers must be trans-
ferred to Intensive Care if they are in default (for example due to
insolvency). This graduated approach ensures that higher-risk cus-
tomers can continue to be managed promptly by specialists in a
manner appropriate to the risks involved and in defined standard-
ised processes.

In the ACR segment, by contrast, there is no separation of re-

sponsibilities between the performing loan area and Intensive Care.

Credit risk management here has been merged into one unit
across all rating classes.

The aim is to fully wind down all the assets grouped in this
segment in a way that preserves value. To this end, EaD-based
guidelines have been established and an asset management pro-
gramme has been implemented. This is carried out through regular
asset planning. The main aim here is to priori the winding down
or reduction of those parts of the portfolio and individual loans for
which the capital requirement is particularly high. Opportunities for
selling sub-portfolios in a way that preserves value may also be
used to free up capital as part of the systematic portfolio reduction.
For business in Public Finance, the reduction is primarily through
regular maturities of assets. Market opportunities that arise are
used in a targeted way for the sale of individual assets.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Risk management

Commerzbank manages default risk using a comprehensive risk
management system. The management framework comprises an
organisational structure, methods and models, quantitative and
qualitative management tools and regulations and processes. The
risk management system ensures that the entire portfolio and the
sub-portfolios, right down to individual exposure level, are man-
aged consistently and thoroughly on a top-down basis.

The ratios and measures required for the operational process of
risk management are based on the overarching Group objectives.
The principle of maintaining a low-risk profile in all business deci-
sions is closely combined here with the risk function’s aim of
providing the front office with appropriate support. The Bank's
particular preference is for credit growth in granular lending busi-
ness with good credit ratings. It also prefers business and prod-
ucts with low complexity and pays attention to the responsiveness
of credit lines and exposures.

Quantitative credit risk strategy guidelines limit risks with
regard to poorer credit ratings and exposures with high loss-at-
default contributions (concentration management) and for selected
sub-portfolios with a high risk weight or regulatory importance,
and, as applicable, for individual products with a high portfolio
share. Detailed arrangements for operationalising the guidelines

for selected sub-portfolios are set out in separate portfolio policies.

In addition, qualitative management guidelines in the form of
credit policies define the target business of the Bank. At the level
of individual transactions, they regulate the transaction type for
which the available risk resources are to be used. These credit pol-
icies are firmly embedded in the credit process: transactions
which do not meet the requirements are escalated through a fixed
competence regulation.

Group-wide guiding principles are based on risk-oriented anal-
yses of trends (e.g. of the development of weaker credit ratings
over time) combined with an assessment of external framework
conditions and internal rules. Risk-oriented analyses on key dates
(e.g. rating profile of individual asset classes) are used in particu-
lar to derive portfolio guiding principles. Trend analyses of prod-
uct-specific risk drivers are key factors for determining product
guiding principles (e.g. loan-to-value of mortgage lending). In con-
trast, credit and portfolio policies are primarily produced through
a multi-level coordination process involving the product and port-

folio managers from the front and back offices, combined with an
assessment of internal and external information sources.

To monitor compliance with credit risk strategic rules, conti-
nuous monitoring and reporting has also been set up at whole
Group level and at segment or sub-portfolio level. Asset quality
reviews by the risk function make an important contribution here
to quality assurance and early risk detection. The key aspects of
monitoring vary according to the subject matter and target audi-
ence, and ad-hoc reporting processes are in place. In addition,
crisis events may pose a risk to the Bank’s capital and liquidity
adequacy and thereby to its risk-bearing capacity. In a crisis, the
Risk Mitigation Task Force will manage decisions flexibly in a co-
ordinated, Group-wide process. As part of the process, emergency
action plans ensure that risk-mitigation measures are implemented
quickly and efficiently. The avoidance of risk concentrations is a
core strategy of risk management. Risk concentrations are actively
managed in order to identify at an early stage and contain the in-
creased potential for loss from the synchronous movement of risk
positions. In addition to exposure-related credit risk concentra-
tions (bulk risks), default risk also includes country and sector
concentrations. Segment-specific features are taken into account
here.

A uniform definition based on “all-in’

is used to manage bulk
risk. The all-in concept comprises all customer credit lines
approved by the Bank in their full amount — irrespective of the loan
utilisation to date.

Management and the Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee are
regularly informed about the results of the analyses.

Management of economic capital commitment

Economic capital commitment is managed in order to ensure that
the Commerzbank Group holds sufficient capital. To this end, all
relevant risk types in the overall risk strategy for economic risk
capital are given limits on a Group-wide basis, with, in particular, a
CVaR limit being specified. Due to the systematically restricted
options for reducing default risk on a short-term basis, it is im-
portant to take account of expected trends (medium-term and
long-term) in order to manage credit risk. For this reason, forecast
values of credit risk parameters play a key role in ongoing man-
agement. At segment and business area level, changes to forecasts
are monitored and adjustments made when necessary. There is no
cascaded capital limit concept for credit risk below Group level.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Rating classification

The Commerzbank rating method comprises 25 rating classes for
customers not in default (1.0 to 5.8) and five default classes (6.1 to
6.5). The Commerzbank master scale allocates precisely one rating
class, stable over time, to each probability of default. The rating
methods are validated annually and recalibrated where necessary
so that they reflect the latest assessment based on all actual
observed defaults. The probability of default ranges assigned to
the ratings are the same for all portfolios. This ensures internal
comparability consistent with the master scale method. For guid-

ee) ere

ance and indicative purposes, the Commerzbank master scale also
shows external ratings as well as credit quality steps in accord-
ance with Article 136 CRR. However, a direct reconciliation is not
possible, because external ratings of different portfolios show fluc-
tuating default rates from year to year.

The credit approval authorities of both individual staff and the
committees (full Board of Managing Directors, Credit Committee,
sub-credit committees) are graduated by a range of factors includ-
ing size of exposure and rating class.

Risk mitigation

The collateral taken into account in risk management changed in
the period under review from €99.0bn to €104.5bn for positions in
the Group’s performing portfolio and from €1.6bn to €0.9bn for
positions in the default portfolio.

Commerzbank mitigates credit risk through various measures
including collateral and netting procedures.

Types of collateral include in particular mortgages, financial
collateral, guarantees, indemnities, credit derivatives, life insur-
ance policies, other registered liens and other physical collateral.

The Bank takes account of credit risk mitigation effects from
the acceptance of recognisable warranties (guarantees, compa-
rable claims on third parties) by using the guarantor’s risk para-
meters (PD and LGD) and/or the regulatory risk weightings.

As at the reporting date, no loan loss provisions were created
for transactions with a total volume of €5.3bn, as these are entirely
collateralised.

Where eligible from a regulatory point of view, guarantors are
subject to a creditworthiness check and rating assignment based
on their sector and business as part of the assessment of their
declaration of liability. The aim of the creditworthiness check is to
establish the guarantor’s creditworthiness and maximum solvency.

The quality of the collateralisation is rigorously checked in line
with regulatory requirements and monitored on an ongoing basis.
This includes in particular checks on legal enforceability and regu-
lar measurement of the collateral, carried out at appropriate inter-
vals depending on the type of collateral, at least annually or on an
event-driven basis. Positive correlations between the debtor's
creditworthiness and the value of the collateral or guarantee are
defined in the credit and collateral processing process. Collateral
processing for Corporate Clients is performed exclusively by the
collateral management team within the risk function.

The Bank analyses all credit collateral (physical and personal
collateral) for evidence of collateral concentrations. The analysis
includes checks on various dimensions such as collateral catego-
ries, the borrower's rating classes or regional allocations of collat-
eral. The full Board of Managing Directors receives regular infor-
mation in respect of the above dimensions about changes in the
collateral pool and possible issues/concentrations.

The measurement and processing of collateral is governed by
generally applicable standards and collateral-specific instructions
(guidelines, process descriptions, IT instructions). Legally verified
standard agreements and models are used wherever possible. The
standards established to hedge or mitigate credit risk include:

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

e Legal and operational standards for documentation and data
collection and measurement standards.

e Standards to ensure the uniformity and timeliness of collateral
measurement through the definition of measurement processes,
uniform measurement methods, parameters and defined col-
lateral discounts, clear definition of competences and responsi-
bility for the processing and measurement process, and regular
remeasurement frequencies.

© Other standards to take account of specific risks such as oper-
ational risk, correlation and concentration risk, market price
change risk (e.g. due to currency fluctuations), country risk,
legal and legal change risk and the risk of inadequate insur-

ance coverage.

Commerzbank Group

Commerzbank focusses its business on two customer segments,
“Private and Small-Business Customers” and “Corporate Clients”.
In the “Asset & Capital Recovery” segment, the Bank has bundled
the activities of the Commercial Real Estate and Ship Finance areas
and complex financings from the Public Finance area. The inten-
tion is that all the portfolios in this segment should be completely
wound down over time.

Credit risk parameters
The credit risk parameters in the Commerzbank Group are distrib-
uted in the rating classes 1.0 to 5.8 over the segments as follows:

The Group’s country risk as ment covers both transfer risks

and event risks driven by political and economic events which im-
pact on the individual economic entities of a country. Country risks

are managed on the basis of defined credit risk and transfer risk

limits at country level. Country exposures which are significant for
‘ize are handled by the Strategic Risk
Committee on a separate basis.

The regional breakdown of the exposure corresponds to the
Bank’s strategic direction and reflects the main areas of its global

business activities.

Around half of the Bank’s exposure relates to Germany, another
third to other countries in Europe, 8% to North America and 9%
to Asia. The rest is broadly diversified and is split among a large
number of countries where we serve German exporters in parti-
cular or where Commerzbank has a local presence. The expected
loss of the Group portfolio is mainly divided between Germany and
the other European countries. A main driver of the expected loss
in the region “Other” is ship financing.

In view of current geopolitical developments, national eco-
nomies such as Russia, Turkey and China are closely monitored.
As at the end of 2018, exposure to Russia was €2.6bn, exposure to

Turkey was €1.7bn and exposure to China was €6.4bn.
The sovereign exposures of Italy and Spain are also still closely
monitored as a result of the sovereign debt crisis. As at the end of

2018, Commerzbank’s Italian sovereign exposure was €8.4bn,
while its Spanish sovereign exposure was €1.3bn.

Risk result The risk result relating to the Group’s lending busi-
ness in 2018 amounted to €-446m. The risk result in the Corpo-
rate Clients segment benefited mainly from a reversal associated

with a single exposure.

Compared with the previous year the calculation of the risk re-
sult showed substantial changes due to the conversion to IFRS 9.
The following table shows the breakdown of the risk result by stage
according to IFRS 9.

The fluctuations of market values in the shipping portfolio are

not recognised in the risk result. They are recognised in the gain

or loss from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value

through profit and loss.

The risk result of the third and fourth quarters of 2018, with loan
loss provisions of €133m and €154m respectively projected for a
full year, is in line with a normalised level. From the present per-
spective, the risk result for the year 2019 as a whole will therefore
not be less than €550m.

Default portfolio The Group’s default portfolio stood at €3,839m
as at 31 December 2018.

The following breakdown of the default portfolio shows the
claims in the default portfolio in the amortised cost and fair value
OCI (other comprehensive income) categories. The loans, of
which by far the greatest share of €3.6bn relates to the loans and
receivables class and €171m to off-balance sheet transactions,
are assigned solely to the amortised cost category. The fair value
OCI category exclusively includes securities in the amount of
€67m, which are fully assigned to the securitised debt instru-

ments class. The collateral shown shall be liable to the full extent

for loans in the amortised cost category, with €876m relating to
loans and receivables and €37m to off-balance sheet transactions.

The decrease in the parameters is mainly due to the reclassifi-
cation of the shipping portfolio as part of the conversion to IFRS 9
at the beginning of 2018.

The Private and Small-Business Customers segment (PSBC) com-
prises the activities of Private Customers, Small-Business Cus-
tomers, comdirect bank and Commerz Real. mBank is also shown.
in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment. Private
Customers includes Commerzbank’s branch business in Germany
for private customers as well as Wealth Management. Small-
Business Customers contains business customers and small cor-
porate customers.

The focus of the portfolio is on traditional owner-occupied
home financing and the financing of real estate capital invest-
ments (residential mortgage loans and investment properties with
a total EaD of €81bn). We provide our business and small-business
customers with credit in the form of individual loans with a volume
of €20bn. In addition, we meet our customers’ day-to-day demand
for credit with consumer loans (consumer and instalment loans
and credit cards, to a total of €16bn). The portfolio’s expansion
over the last twelve months was largely due to residential mort-
gage loans.

Compared with year-end 2017, the risk density of the portfolio
decreased by one basis point to 25 basis points.

Commercial Real Estate The portfolio further decreased due to
redemptions and repayments. Compared with 31 December 2017,
risk density decreased from 185 basis points to 53 basis points.

Ship Finance Ship finance exposure in the performing loan
book was reduced by almost €2bn overall and expected loss by
more than €250m compared with 31 December 2017, primarily
as a result of the conversion to IFRS 9. The decrease was mainly
attributable to the introduction of the fair value approach accord-
ing to IFRS 9 at the beginning of 2018 as well as to disposals dur-
ing the course of the year.

Overall our portfolio is mainly made up of three standard types
of ship: container ships (€0.1bn), tankers (€0.2bn) and bulkers
(€0.1bn). The rest of the portfolio consists of v:

‘ious special pur-
pose vehicles, which are well diversified across the various ship
segments.

There was a further recovery in the bulker and container markets
in the first half of 2018, building on some significant improve-
ments in 2017 following the historical lows recorded in 2016.
Charter rates in both segments slowed again in the second half of
the year, however, considerably in some cases, with Capesize
bulkers falling below the corresponding 2017 level. This slowdown
was due to a combination of falling demand and a high number of
ship deliveries coupled with extremely low scrappage levels. This
meant that full debt servicing was once again not possible in the
year under review. It was a contrasting picture for the tanker

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

markets, which saw charter rates fall until the third quarter of
2018 due to the excess supply of tonnage in recent years. Falling
new ship deliveries and intense scrappage activity coupled with
stronger-than-expected demand for crude oil as a result of the
buoyant global economy then sent charter rates soaring from the
fourth quarter of the year, allowing a temporary resumption of
regular debt servicing. The Bank will continue to reduce problem
and non-performing loan exposures as part of its ongoing effort to
run down the portfolio.

Public Finance The Public Finance sub-portfolio in the ACR
segment is largely made up of exposures with credit quality rang-
ing from satisfactory to good, some of them with very long maturi-
ties and complex structures, to local authorities in the UK (€2.9bn.
EaD), a private finance initiative (PFI) portfolio (€3.5bn EaD) with
a regional focus on the UK and further Public Finance debtors,
predominantly in the USA (€1.3bn EaD).

The risk result in the ACR segment was €-8m in financial year
2018.

The default portfolio in the segment stood at €351m as at
31 December 2018. The decrease in the parameters is mainly due
to the reclassification of the shipping portfolio as part of the con-
version to IFRS 9 at the beginning of 2018. The exposure of fair
value P&L credit positions with default criterion stood at €385m.
The default portfolio of the sub-portfolio Ship Finance stood at
€729m as at 31 December 2017.

Financial Institutions portfolio
Our network of correspondent banks continued to focus on trade
finance activities on behalf of our corporate customers and on
capital market activities. In derivatives, we enter into trades with
selected counterparties under the European Market Infrastructure
Regulation (EMIR) standards.

We continue to keep a close watch on the impact of regulatory

requirements on banks. In this context, we continue to pursue our

strategy of holding as few exposures as possible which might
absorb losses in the event of a bail-in of an affected institution.
We are keeping a close eye on developments in various coun-

tri

with individual issues such as recessions, embargoes or eco-
nomic uncertainty caused by political events and are responding
with flexible portfolio management that is tailored to the individual
situation of each country. Overall, our risk appetite is geared to

keeping the portfolio as responsive as possible.

Conduit exposure and other asset-backed exposures
Commerzbank is the sponsor of the multiseller asset-backed com-
mercial paper conduit Silver Tower. It uses it to securitise receiv-
ables, in particular trade and leasing receivables, from customers in
the Corporate Clients segment. The transactions are financed pre-
dominantly through the issue of asset-backed commercial paper
(ABCP) or through the drawing of credit lines (liquidity lines). The
volume and risk values in the Silver Tower conduit rose by €0.1bn
in the fourth quarter of 2018. As at 31 December 2018, the volume
had fallen by around €0.1bn year-on-year to €3.9bn.

Liquidity risks from securitisations are modelled conservatively
in the internal liquidity risk model. Firstly, a worst-case assump-
tion is made that Commerzbank will have to take on the funding of
a major part of the purchase facilities provided to its special-
purpose vehicles within the scope of the Silver Tower conduit.

Secondly, the Bank’s holdings of securitisation transactions only
qualify as liquid assets if they are eligible for rediscount at the
European Central Bank. These positions are only included in the
liquidity risk calculation after applying conservative discounts.

The other asset-backed exposures mainly comprise govern-
ment-guaranteed ABSs held by Commerzbank Finance & Covered
Bond S.A. and Commerzbank AG in Germany. The volume fell to
€4.0bn during 2018 (December 2017: €4.5bn), while risk values!
fell to €3.8bn (December 2016: €4.4bn).

There are also investments in the Structured Credit area. The
volume of new investments entered into since 2014 stood at
€3.8bn (December 2017: €2.9bn). In general, we have traditionally
invested in bonds of senior tranches of securitisation transactions
in the consumer (auto) ABS, UK RMBS and CLO asset classes,
which show a robust structure and a moderate risk profile.

” Risk value is the balance sheet value of cash instruments. For long CDS positions, it comprises the nominal value of the reference

instrument less the net present value of the credit derivative.

At the end of 2018, this portfolio contained only AAA-rated CLO
positions. Remaining structured credit positions with a volume of

€1.3bn were already in the portfolio prior to 2014 (December 2017:

€1.6bn), while risk values stood at €0.4bn (December 2017:
€0.7bn).

Forbearance portfolio
The EBA’s definition of forbearance comprises two requirements,
which have to be met concurrently: The debtor is in financial diffi-
culties and the measures of the bank to help the debtor include
concessions to the debtor that the bank would not have agreed to
under different circumstances. Examples of concessions include
deferrals, increases in limits or loans and waivers in connection
with restructuring. The definition of forbearance applies inde-
pendently of whether the debtor is in the performing or the non-
performing portfolio.

The following table shows Commerzbank’s total forbearance

Market risk

Market risk is the risk of potential financial losses due to changes
in market prices (interest rates, commodities, credit spreads,
exchange rates and equity prices) or in parameters that affect
prices such as volatilities and correlations. Losses may impact
profit or loss directly, e.g. in the case of trading book positions.
However, for banking book positions they are generally reflected
in the revaluation reserve or in hidden liabilities/reserves.

Strategy and organisation
Commerzbank’s market risk strategy is derived from its overall risk
strategy and the business strategies of the individual segments. It
sets targets for market risk management in relation to Commerz-
bank’s main business activities. The core market risk management
tasks are the identification of all material market risks and drivers
of market risk and the independent measurement and evaluation
of these. The results and estimates serve as the basis for risk/
return-oriented management.

The Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank is respon-
sible for ensuring the effective management of market risk
throughout the Commerzbank Group. Specific levels of authority
and responsibility in relation to market risk management have
been assigned to the appropriate market risk committees.

Various market risk committees have been established within
the Bank. In these, segment representatives, along with repre-
sentatives from the risk function and finance area, discuss current
risk positioning issues and decide on appropriate action. Chaired
by the risk function, the Group Market Risk Committee, which
meets monthly, deals with the Commerzbank Group’s market risk
position. Discussions centre on the monthly market risk report,
which is also presented to the Board of Managing Directors for
their consideration. The report summarises the latest develop-
ments on financial markets, the Bank’s positioning and related
risk ratios. The Segment Market Risk Committee focuses on the
Corporate Clients segment and the Group Treasury di

ision. This

committee also manages market risks arising from non-core activi-
ties (Asset & Capital Recovery).

The risk management process involves the identification,
measurement, management and monitoring of risks and reporting
on them. It is the responsibility in functional terms of market risk
management, which is independent of trading activi
market risk management is complemented by decentralised mar-
ket risk management units at segment level and for regional units
and subsidiaries. The close integration of central and local risk
management with the business units means that the risk manage-
ment process starts in the trading areas themselves. The trading
units are responsible in particular for the active management of

Central

market risk positions, e.g. reduction measures or hedging.

Risk management

Commerzbank uses a wide range of quantitative and qualitative
tools to manage and monitor market risk. Quantitative limits for
sensitivities, value at risk, stress tests, scenario analyses and ratios
on economic capital limit the market risk. Our comprehensive
rulebook, in the form of market risk policies and guidelines as well
as restrictions on portfolio structure, new products, maturities and
minimum ratings, establishes the qualitative framework for market
risk management. The market risk strategy lays down the
weighting of figures in each segment by reference to their rele-
vance. Thereby allowance is made for the varying impact of the
parameters for the management of the segments in line with the
business strategy.

Market risk is managed internally at Group level, segment level
and in each segment’s reporting units. A comprehensive internal
limit system broken down to portfolio level is implemented and
forms a core part of internal market risk management.

The quantitative and qualitative factors limiting market risk are
determined by the market risk committees by reference to the
Group's management of economic capital. The utilisation of these
limits, together with the relevant net income figures, is reported
daily to the Board of Managing Directors and the responsible heads
of the Group divisions. Based on qualitative analyses and quantita-
tive ratios, the market risk function identifies potential future risks,
anticipates potential financial losses in collaboration with the
finance function, and draws up proposals for further action, which
are discussed with the front office units. Voting on the proposed
measures or risk positions takes place in the above-mentioned
market risk committees and is subsequently submitted to the
Board of Managing Directors for approval.

Risk concentrations are restricted directly using specific limits
or are indirectly avoided, for example, using stress test limits. In
addition, the combination of various conventional risk measures
(e.g. VaR, sens

ivities) ensures the appropriate management of
concentration risks. Furthermore, risk drivers are analysed on a
regular basis in order to identify concentrations. The risk man-
agement of existing concentrations is also reviewed using situa-
tion-driven analyses and, where necessary, supplemented by tar-
geted measures such as limits.

Any limits that are breached are handled in a separate escala-
tion procedure. After a limit breach has been identified, the front
office and risk units design adequate countermeasures. If the limit
breach cannot be remedied within a reasonable period, it will be
escalated by the market risk function to the next hierarchical level.

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

Regulatory risk measures that are not included in economic
risk-bearing capacity are limited and managed separately. These
include, for example, stressed VaR and incremental risk charge.

In internal management, all positions relevant to market risk
are covered, and trading and banking book positions are jointly
managed. In addition, for regulatory purposes the trading book is
managed separately (in accordance with regulatory requirements,
including currency and commodity risks in the banking book) and
interest rate risks in the banking book are managed on a stand-
alone basis. In order to provide a consistent presentation in this
report, all figures relating to the VaR are based on a confidence
level of 99%, a holding period of one day, equally weighted mar-
ket data and a 254-day history.

Over the course of 2018, the VaR for the overall book fell by
€20m to €34m. This was primarily caused by bringing VaR into
line with IFRS 9 accounting.

Below, we show how the regulatory market risk ratios of the trad-

standardised approaches for their regulatory capital calculation
under partial use rules. These figures are not contained in the VaR
figures shown in this report.

Further risk ratios are calculated for regulatory capital adequacy.
This includes the calculation of stressed VaR. Stressed VaR is cal-
culated using the internal model on the basis of the VaR method
described above. The main difference lies in the market data used
to value the assets. Stressed VaR measures the risk in the present
position in the trading book by reference to market movements
from a specified crisis period in the past. The crisis observation
period used for this is checked regularly through model validation
and approval processes and adjusted where necessary. The crisis
observation period remained the same in the course of the year.
Stressed VaR climbed from €31m at end-2017 to €35m at the end
of 2018. This was due primarily to changes in positions in the
Corporate Clients segment.

The market risk profile in stressed VaR is also diversified across

po sean

all asset classes.

In addition, the incremental risk charge and the equity event VaR
figures quantify the risk of deterioration in creditworthiness and
event risks in trading book positions. The incremental risk charge
fell by €24m to €19m over the course of 2018. The decline is
mainly attributable to the Corporate Clients segment.

The reliability of the internal model (historical simulation) is
monitored in various ways, including by backtesting on a daily
basis. The VaR calculated is set against actually occurring profits
and losses. The VaR used in backtesting is based on the complete
historical simulation and therefore represents all internal models

used in the market risk VaR calculation of capital adequacy require-
ments at Group level. The process draws a distinction between
“clean P&L” and “dirty PSL” backtesting. In the former, exactly the
same positions in the income statement are used as were used for
calculating the VaR. This means that the profits and losses result
only from changes in market prices (hypothetical changes in the
portfolio value). In dirty P&L backtesting, by contrast, profits and
losses from newly concluded and expired transactions from the day
under consideration are also included (actual profits and losses in-
duced by portfolio value changes). Profits and losses from valuation
adjustments and model reserves are factored into dirty and clean
P&L according to the regulatory requirements. If the actual loss
exceeds the VaR, it is described as a negative backtesting outlier.

Analysing the results of backtesting provides an informative
basis for checking parameters and for improving the market risk
model. In 2018, we saw no negative clean P&L outliers and no
negative dirty P&L outliers. The results confirm the quality of the
VaR model. Backtesting is also used by the supervisory authorities
for evaluating internal risk models. Negative outliers are classified
by means of a traffic-light system laid down by the supervisory
authorities. All negative backtesting outliers at Group level (from
both clean P&L and dirty P&L) must be reported to the supervisory
authorities, citing their extent and cause.

As the VaR concept gives a prediction of potential losses on
the assumption of normal market conditions, it is supplemented
by the calculation of stress tests. These stress tests measure the
risk to which Commerzbank is exposed, based on unlikely but still
plausible events. These events may be simulated using extreme
movements on various financial markets. The key scenarios relate
to major changes in credit spreads, interest rates and yield curves,
exchange rates, share prices and commodities prices. Events
simulated in stress tests include all stock prices falling by 15%, a
parallel shift in the yield curve or changes to the curve’s gradient.
Extensive Group-wide stress tests and scenario analyses are car-
ried out as part of risk monitoring.

The internal model’s individual components are independently
validated at regular intervals to assess their appropriateness for

risk measurement. The identi ion and elimination of model

weaknesses are of particular importance in this.

Banking book

The key drivers of market risk in the banking book are the Group
Treasury portfolios, with their credit spread, interest rate and basis
risks, and the area of Asset & Capital Recovery (ACR) — Public
Finance, along with the positions held by the subsidiary Commerz-
bank Finance & Covered Bond S.A.


--- Page 62 ---

In market risk management, credit spread sensitivities in the
banking and trading books are considered together. Credit spread
sensitivities (downshift of 1 basis point) for all securities and deriv-
ative positions (excluding loans) were at €41m as at the end of
2018.

Most credit spread sensitivities related to securities positions
measured at amortised cost. Changes in market price have no im-
pact on the revaluation reserve or the income statement for these
positions.

The impact of an interest rate shock on the economic value of
the Group’s banking book is simulated monthly in compliance with
regulatory requirements. In accordance with the EU Banking
Directive, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority
(BaFin) and the European Central Bank (ECB) have prescribed two
scenarios of uniform, sudden and unexpected changes in interest
rates (+/-200 basis points) to be used by all banks, which have to
report on the results of this stress test every quarter. The calcula-
tion methodology was changed from BaFin rules to ECB methodol-
ogy with effect from 30 June 2018. The changes versus year-end
2017 are largely attributable to the changed calculation methodol-
ogy.

The outcome of the +200 basis points scenario would be a
potential loss of €1,651m, while the -200 basis points scenario
would result in a potential profit of €230m, both as at 31 Decem-
ber 2018. Commerzbank does not, therefore, need to be classified
as a bank with elevated interest rate risk, as the decline in net
present value represents less than 20% of its regulatory capital.

As at 31 December 2018, the interest rate sensitivity of the
entire banking book (without pension fund) was €6.3m per basis
point of interest rate reduction.

Pension fund risk is also part of market risk in the banking
book. Our pension fund portfolio comprises a well-diversified in-
vestment section and a section comprising insurance-related liabil-
ities. The duration of the liabilities is extremely long (cash out-
flows modelled over almost 90 years), and the main portion of the
overall portfolio’s present value risk is in maturities of 15 years
and over. The main risk drivers are long-term euro interest rates,
credit spreads and expected euro inflation due to anticipated pen-
sion dynamics. Equity, volatility and foreign exchange risk also
need to be taken into consideration. Diversification effects be-
tween individual risks reduce the overall risk. The extremely long
maturities of these liabilities represent the greatest challenge, par-
ticularly for hedging credit spread risk. This is because there is
insufficient liquidity in the market for corresponding hedging
products.

Market liquidity risk

In measuring economic capital adequacy, Commerzbank also
takes account of market liquidity risk. This is the risk of the Bank
not being able to liquidate or hedge risky positions in a timely

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

manner, to the desired extent and on acceptable terms as a result
of insufficient liquidity in the market.

The first step is to create a realistic downsizing profile for
each portfolio on the basis of its product and risk strategies and
an assessment of the market. This enables portfolios to be classi-
fied in terms of their convertibility into cash using a “market
liquidity factor”. The market liquidity factor takes into account the
heightened volatility of portfolio value resulting from the extended
holding period for risk positions in line with the portfolio’s down-
sizing profile. The market risk of every portfolio is then evaluated
based on a one-year view and weighted with the market liquidity
factor.

At the end of 2018, Commerzbank had earmarked €0.1bn in
economic capital to cover market liquidity risk in the trading and
banking books. Asset-backed securities and structured products in
particular have a higher market liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk

We define liquidity risk in the narrower sense as the risk that
Commerzbank will be unable to meet its payment obligations on a
day-to-day basis. In a broader sense, liquidity risk describes the
risk that future payments cannot be funded for the full amount, in
the required currency or at standard market conditions, as and
when they are due.

Strategy and organisation

The Board of Managing Directors adopts the business strategy and
the Bank’s risk tolerance, which is associated with it. Liquidity risk
tolerance is then operationalised by defining the liquidity reserve
period and the limit framework. In order to ensure an appropriate
liquidity risk management process, the Board of Managing Direc-
tors delegates certain competences and responsibilities in connec-
tion with the Group-wide liquidity risk strategy to the Risk and
Treasury functions.

The central Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for
limiting, analysing and monitoring liquidity risk and for strategic
liquidity positioning. ALCO is supported by various sub-committees.
in this.

Risk management

Commerzbank uses a wide range of tools to manage and monitor
liquidity risks on the basis of its own liquidity risk model. The
stress scenario within the Bank that underlies the model and is
relevant for management purposes allows for the impact of both a
bank-specific stress event and a broader market crisis. Binding
regulatory requirements are an integral component of the man-
agement mechanism.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft

Group Treasury is responsible for the Group’s liquidity manage-
ment operations. Group Treasury is represented in all major loca-
tions of the Group in Germany and abroad and has reporting lines
into all subsidiaries. Commerzbank manages its global liquidity
centrally using cash pooling. This approach ensures that liquidity
resources are used efficiently and that this occurs across all time
zones, as Group Treasury units are located in Frankfurt, London,
New York and Singapore. Liquidity risk is monitored on the basis of
the Bank’s own liquidity risk model by the independent risk func-
tion.

The Bank has established early warning indicators for the
purpose of managing liquidity risk. These ensure that appropri-
ate steps can be taken in good time to secure long-term financial
solidity.

Risk concentrations can lead to increased outflows of liquidity,
particularly in a stress situation, and thus to increased liquidity risk.
They can, for example, occur with regard to maturities, large indi-
vidual creditors or currencies. By means of ongoing monitoring and
reporting, emerging risk concentrations in funding can be recog-
nised in a timely manner and mitigated through suitable measures.

This also applies to payment obligations in foreign currencies.
The Bank also mitigates concentration by continuously using
broadly diversified sources of funding, in particular diverse cus-
tomer deposits and capital market instruments. Commerzbank also.
ensures that it monitors foreign exchange risks and fulfils the cur-
rency matching requirements for highly liquid assets and net liquid-
dity outflows.

In the event of a liquidity crisis, the emergency plan provides
for various measures for different types of crisis, which can be
launched by the central ALCO. The emergency plan forms an inte-
gral part of Commerzbank’s recovery plan and is updated at least
once a year; the individual liquidity emergency measures are
checked regularly during the year for plausibility. The emergency
plan also defines a clear allocation of responsibilities for the pro-
cesses to be followed in emergency situations and gives details of
any action that may need to be taken.

Liquidity risk model

A key component of liquidity risk management is the daily cal-
culation of the liquidity gap profile. The liquidity gap profile shows
the deterministic or stochastic inflows and outflows expected in
the future on a given reporting date and across all portfolios. This
forms the basis for calculating liquidity requirements or excess
liquidity per maturity band. This also includes modelling the pro-
portion of customer deposits that will be permanently available,
known as the core deposit base.

The liquidity gap profile is also used to set the issuance strategy
of the Commerzbank Group, which is operationalised by the Group
Treasury division. The Group Finance division is responsible for
calculating and allocating liquidity costs on the basis of the liquidity
gap profile, which are then incorporated in the management of the
segments’ business activities.

Based on the liquidity gap profile, management mechanisms
such as recovery and early warning indicators are limited and mon-
itored accordingly. The liquidity gap profile is limited in all maturity
bands. The Group limits are broken down into individual Group
units and currencies. The internal liquidity risk model is comple-
mented by the regular analysis of additional adverse, reverse and
historical stress scenarios.

Quantification and stress testing

Commerzbank uses a wide range of tools to manage and monitor
liquidity risks on the basis of its own liquidity risk model. In addi-
tion to internal economic considerations, liquidity risk modelling
also factors in the binding regulatory requirements under the Capi-
tal Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the Minimum Require-
ments for Risk Management (MaRisk). Commerzbank incorporates
this within its liquidity risk framework, thereby quantifying the
liquidity risk appetite established by the full Board of Managing
Directors.

The stress scenarios within the Bank that underlie the model
and are relevant for management purposes allow for the impact of
both a bank-specific stress event and a broader market crisis. The
Commerzbank-specific idiosyncratic scenario simulates a stress
situation arising from a rating downgrade of two notches, whereas
the market-wide scenario is derived from experience of the sub-
prime crisis and simulates an external market-wide shock. The
main liquidity risk drivers of both scenarios are a markedly in-
creased outflow of short-term customer deposits, above-average
drawdown of credit lines, extensions of lending business regarded
as commercially necessary, the need to provide additional col-
lateral for secured transactions and the application of higher risk
discounts to the liquidation values of assets. As a complement to
the individual scenarios, the Bank also simulates the impact on the
liquidity gap profile (net liquidity position) of a scenario that com-
bines idiosyncratic and market-specific effects. The liquidity gap
profile is shown for the whole of the modelling horizon across the
full spectrum of maturities and follows a multi-level concept. This
allows for a nuanced presentation — deterministic and modelled
cash flows in existing business on the one hand and the inclusion
of prolongations on the other.

The table below shows the liquidity gap profile values after ap-
plication of the respective stress scenarios for periods of one and
three months as at the end of the year. Significantly more liquidity
flows out in a combined scenario compared with the individual
scenarios. As at the end of the final quarter of 2018, in the one-
month and three-month periods, the combined stress scenario
leaves net liquidity of €11.0bn and €11.7bn respectively.

Liquidity reserves

Significant factors in the liquidity risk appetite include the reserve
period, the size of the liquidity reserve portfolio held to compen-
sate for unexpected short-term liquidity outflows, and the limits
in the various maturity bands. As the liquidity reserve portfolio
consists of highly liquid assets, it functions as a buffer in stress
situations. The liquidity reserve portfolio is funded in line with
the liquidity risk appetite to ensure that it is kept at the required
size throughout the entire reserve period stipulated by the Board
of Managing Directors.

As at the reporting date, the Bank had a liquidity reserve of
€77.3bn in the form of highly liquid assets. A part of this liquidity
reserve is held in a separate stress liquidity reserve portfolio man-
aged by Group Treasury to cover liquidity outflows should a stress
event occur and to ensure solvency at all times. In addition, the
Bank operates an intraday liquidity reserve portfolio in the amount
of €10.0bn as at the reporting date.

Liquidity ratios
Throughout 2018, Commerzbank’s internal liquidity ratios, in-
cluding the regulatory liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), were at all
times above the limits set by the Board of Managing Directors.
The same is true of compliance with the survival period calculation
set down by MaRisk.

The regulatory LCR is contained in the internal liquidity risk
model as a binding secondary condition. The LCR is calculated as
the ratio of liquid assets to net liquidity outflows under stressed

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

conditions. It is used to measure whether a bank has a large
enough liquidity buffer to independently withstand any potential
imbalance between inflows and outflows of liquidity under stressed
conditions over a period of 30 calendar days. As of 1 January 2018,
the Bank must maintain a ratio of at least 100%.

In 2018, Commerzbank significantly exceeded the minimum
ratio of 100% stipulated for that year on every reporting date. As
at the end of 2018, the average month-end value of the LCR over
the last twelve months was 135.66%.

The Bank has established corresponding limits and early warn-
ing indicators to ensure the LCR minimum requirements are met.

Operational risk

Based on the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), Commerz-
bank defines operational risk (OpRisk) as the risk of loss resulting
from the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people and
systems or from external events. This definition includes legal
risks; it does not cover strategic or reputational risks. In view of

their increased economic significance, compliance risk and cyber
risk are managed as separate risk types. In line with the CRR,
however, losses from compliance and cyber risks are still incorpo-
rated into the model for determining the regulatory and economic
capital required for operational risks.

Strategy and organisation

Within Commerzbank, OpRisk and governance issues of the Inter-
nal Control System (ICS) are closely connected in terms of both
organisational structure and methodology and are continuously
being enhanced. This is because many OpRisk cases are closely
linked with failures in the control mechanisms. A properly func-
tioning ICS thereby helps to reduce or avoid losses from opera-

tional risks and thus to lower the amount of capital required to
cover operational risks in the medium to long term. Conversely,
the operational risk management systems enable the ICS to adapt
itself consistently to them. The reinforcement of the ICS structure
is an essential aspect of the proactive reduction or prevention of
operational risks.

Chaired by the CRO, the Group OpRisk Committee meets four
times a year and deals with the management of operational risks
within the Commerzbank Group. It also acts as the escalation and
decision-making committee for key OpRisk topics that span all
areas. The Management Boards and/or the Segment Committees
with responsibility for operational risk deal with the management
of operational risk in the relevant units. They analyse OpRisk
issues that affect them, such as loss events, and define subse-
quent measures or recommend action.

Commerzbank’s OpRisk strategy is approved on an annual ba-
sis by the full Board of Managing Directors after it has been dis-
cussed and voted upon in the Group OpRisk Committee. The

OpRisk strategy describes the risk profile, key elements of the de-
sired risk culture, its management framework and measures to be
taken by Commerzbank to manage operational risk.

OpRisk management is based on three consecutive levels (three
lines of defence) which, when taken together, are crucial for
reaching the given strategic aims.

Risk management

Commerzbank takes an active approach to managing operational
risk, aiming to systematically identify OpRisk profiles and risk
concentrations and to define, prioritise and implement risk mitiga-
tion measures.

Operational risks are characterised by asymmetric distribution
of losses. This means that most of the losses are relatively small,
while isolated losses with a very low probability of occurrence
have the potential to be large and devastating. This makes it nec-
essary not only to limit high loss potential but also to proactively
manage losses that can be expected to occur frequently.

To do this, Commerzbank has set up a multi-stage system that
brings together the defined limits on economic capital (risk capa-
city) and those set for operative risk management during the year
(risk appetite/tolerance), complemented by rules on the transpar-
ent and conscious acceptance and approval of individual risks
(risk acceptance).

OpRisk management includes an annual evaluation of the
Bank’s ICS and a risk scenario assessment. Furthermore, OpRisk
loss events are subjected to ongoing analysis and to ICS back-
testing on an event-driven basis. Lessons learned activities are
carried out after all material loss events. External OpRisk events at

competitors are also systematically evaluated.

Commerzbank uses the advanced measurement approach (AMA)
to measure regulatory and economic capital for operational risks.
Risk-weighted assets for operational risks on this basis came to
€21.4bn at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 (31 December
2017: €21.0bn, 99.9% quantile), while economically required capi-
tal was €1.8bn (31 December 2017: €1.7bn, 99.91% quantile).

The following table gives an overview of risk-weighted assets
and the economically required capital (ErC) by segment:

The total charge for OpRisk events at the end of 2018 was approx-
imately €30m (full-year 2017: €38m). The events mainly related to
losses in the “Process related” and “External fraud” categories.

* Losses incurred and provisions, less OpRisk-based income and repayments.

A structured, centralised and decentralised reporting system
ensures that the management of the Bank and its segments, mem-
bers of the OpRisk Committee and the supervisory bodies are in-
formed regularly, promptly and fully about operational risk.
OpRisk reports are produced quarterly. They contain changes in
OpRisk losses, the segments’ main loss events, current risk anal-
yses, changes in the capital requirement and the status of
measures implemented. Operational risks are also part of the regu-
lar risk reporting process to the full Board of Managing Directors
and to the Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee.

Other risks

To meet the requirements of the Basel framework, MaRisk
requires an integrated approach to risk that also includes unquan-
tifiable risk categories. At Commerzbank, these are subjected to a
qualitative management and control process. The following risk
types except model risk are outside the responsibility of the CRO.

Legal risk

According to the CRR, legal risk falls within the definition of opera-
tional risk. It primarily arises for the Commerzbank Group when the
Bank’s claims cannot be enforced for legal reasons or when claims
can be made against the Bank because the underlying law was not
observed or has changed since a transaction was concluded.

The operation of banking and financial services transactions that
are subject to regulatory provisions may also result in legal risk.
This risk may also take the form of orders or sanctions issued or
imposed by one or more authorities whose supervision Commerz-
bank is subject to anywhere in the world. Legal risk also arises in
realised losses or provisions due to or in connection with court
cases brought against Commerzbank (passive proceedings). Cases
brought by Commerzbank (active proceedings) generally represent
a credit risk rather than an operational risk, so the risk of loss is
already taken into account through write-downs. However, the
costs of legal action (court and lawyers’ costs) for active proceed-
ings are classified as legal risk.

Organisation Within Commerzbank, the functional management
of legal risk throughout the Group is the responsibility of Group
Legal. All legal staff at the various Group Legal locations including
the foreign branches as well as the legal staff of the legal depart-
ments of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries are as legal risk
managers operationally responsible for the identification and
management of the Group-wide legal risk within Commerzbank.

Risk management The task of the Group’s legal risk managers is
to detect legal risks and all losses potentially resulting from them at
an early stage, to highlight possible solutions that might avoid or
minimise such losses, and to play an active part in reaching deci-
sions concerning legal risks. They must ensure that they are always
up to date with all legal changes or new findings within their area
of responsibility and inform the business units affected about the
impact on legal risk and any action that needs to be taken as a
result.

The legal risk managers are responsible for arranging or ad-
justing legal provisions and look after and monitor new and ongo-

ing court proceedings.
In the case of passive proceedings, provisions are recognised
on the basis of the risk assessment carried out by the responsible

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

legal risk manager. The expected risk of loss for proceedings gen-
erally corresponds to the size of the provisions to be recognised.
To estimate the expected loss, the amount that the Bank would
reasonably have to pay to settle the dispute at the current point in
time is calculated after each significant stage in the proceedings.
In the case of active proceedings, provisions are usually only rec-
ognised for the expected court and lawyers’ costs.

Group Legal provides information about all major court pro-
ceedings and risk trends in the quarterly Legal Risk Report. This
report is sent to the Bank’s management and Supervisory Board,
the supervisory authority and the OpRisk Committee.

Current developments Commerzbank and its subsidiaries are
involved in a variety of court and arbitration cases, claims and offi-
cial investigations (legal proceedings) in connection with a broad
range of issues. They include, for example, allegations of defective
advice, disputes in connection with credit finance or payment
transactions, entitlements to occupational pensions, allegedly false
accounting and incorrect financial statements, enforcement of
claims due to tax issues, allegedly incorrect prospectuses in con-
nection with underwriting transactions, alleged violations of com-
petition laws, and cases brought by shareholders and other inves-
tors as well as investigations by US authorities. In addition,
changes to rulings by supreme courts, which may render them
more restrictive, as well as to legal conditions, e.g. in the private
customer business, may result in more claims being brought
against Commerzbank or its subsidiaries. In these court cases,
claimants are mostly asking for the payment of compensation,
claims on account of unjust enrichment or the reversal of agree-
ments already entered into. If the courts were to find in favour of
one or more of the claimants in these cases, Commerzbank could
be liable to pay compensation, which could in some cases be sub-
stantial, or could incur the expense of reversing agreements or of

other cost-intensive measures.

Regulatory authori
countries in which Commerzbank and its subsidiaries are or have

s and governmental institutions in various

been active have for some years been investigating irregularities in
connection with the fixing of foreign exchange rates and with for-
eign exchange business in general. In the course of these investiga-
tions, regulatory authorities and governmental institutions have
also sought checks on Commerzbank or have approached the com-
pany with requests for information. They have also brought one
case. Commerzbank is cooperating fully with these bodies and is
also looking into the relevant matters on the basis of its own com-
prehensive investigations. The possibility of financial consequences
arising from some of these matters cannot be ruled out; however, it
is not yet possible to make more precise statements in that regard.

The public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt is investigating equi-
ty transactions conducted by Commerzbank and the former Dres-
dner Bank around the dividend record date (cum-ex transactions).
Commerzbank is cooperating fully with the authorities. It had al-
ready initiated a forensic analysis of cum-ex transactions at the
end of 2015, which was concluded at the start of 2018 with regard
to Commerzbank’s equity transactions and is still ongoing regard-
ing the equity transactions of the former Dresdner Bank.

In the circular of the German Federal Ministry of Finance
(BMF) dated 17 July 2017, the tax authorities addressed the
treatment of cum-cum transactions, declaring their intention to

critically examine past transactions for indications of abuse of law.

According to the view put forward in the BMF circular, abuse of
law pursuant to Article 42 of the German Tax Code (Abgaben-
ordnung, AO) is indicated if there are no economically reasonable
grounds for the transaction in question and the structure of the
transaction appears to be largely tax-induced (tax arbitrage). The
circular provides a non-exhaustive list of cases which the BMF
will assess for tax purposes.

In a letter dated 18 July 2017, the Bundesbank asked Commerz-
bank to assess the financial repercussions of the potential applica-
tion of the BMF circular by means of a survey form. Based on the
analyses conducted for cum-cum transactions, the Bank recognised
precautionary provisions for potentially refundable own capital
gains taxes.

With respect to cum-cum securities lending transactions,
Commerzbank is exposed to compensation claims from third par-
ties for crediting entitlements that have been denied. Based on the
analyses performed, Commerzbank considers it rather unlikely
that such claims could be enforced. However, it cannot be ruled
out. Based on our estimates, there could be a financial impact in
these cases.

For the other cum-cum-relevant transactions, Commerzbank
has concluded that the legal structuring it adopted was appro-
priate under Article 42 of the German Tax Code.

The possibility that this conclusion could alter as developments
unfold, for example in connection with assessments made by the
tax authorities and fiscal/civil courts, cannot be completely ruled
out.

Some of these cases could also have an impact on the repu-
tation of Commerzbank and its subsidiaries. The Group recognises
provisions for such proceedings if liabilities are likely to result
from them and the amounts to which the Group is likely to be lia-
ble can be determined with sufficient accuracy. Since there are

considerable uncertainties as to how such proceedings will devel-
op, the possibility cannot be ruled out that some of the provisions
recognised for them may prove to be inadequate once the courts’
final rulings are known. As a result, substantial additional expense
may be incurred. This is also true in the case of legal proceedings
for which the Group did not consider it necessary to recognise
provisions. The eventual outcome of some legal proceedings might
have an impact on Commerzbank’s results and cash flow in a spec-
ified reporting period; in the worst case it cannot be fully ruled out
that the liabilities that might result from them may also have a sig-
nificant impact on Commerzbank’s earnings performance, assets
and financial position.

Compliance risk
The success of Commerzbank in terms of its competitiveness and
integrity (reputation) is critically dependent on the trust of its cus-
tomers, shareholders, business partners and employees, as well as
on the regulatory and supervisory authorities and the public. This
trust is based not only on implementing and complying with the
applicable laws, rules, regulations and good market practice that
Commerzbank is required to observe in its Group-wide activities,
but also on recognising and complying with the cultural and legal
frameworks of the countries in which Commerzbank does business.
The Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank actively pro-
motes a strong culture of compliance and has set down and com-
municated corresponding values in the code of conduct.

The risk that may arise from the failure to adhere to key legal
regulations and requirements is referred to as compliance risk. It
includes the risks associated with money laundering, terrorist
financing, sanctions and embargoes, markets compliance as well
as fraud and corruption.

To prevent compliance risks, Commerzbank has implemented
security systems and controls for its transactions, customers, pro-
ducts and processes. These procedures for ensuring compliance
with material legal provisions and requirements are referred to in
their entirety as a compliance management system. Commerz-
bank’s compliance management system is based on international
market standards and the regulatory requirements in the various
countries which are relevant for Commerzbank’s business acti-
vities. Commerzbank is constantly developing its compliance man-
agement system in order to meet its responsibi

ities and address.
the growing complexity and increasing regulatory requirements,
thereby enabling it to secure its long-term business success.

Under the three lines of defence principle, protecting against
undesirable compliance risks is an activity that is not restricted to
the compliance function (Group Compliance). Instead, the organi-
sational control and monitoring elements are aligned in three se-
quential levels. The units in the first line of defence (1LoD) assume
the main responsibility for identifying and managing risks and for
complying with their own business rules; they also ensure that
process-oriented control mechanisms are set up. Group Compli-
ance, the second line of defence (2LoD), oversees the appropriate-
ness and effectiveness of the procedures and controls in the first
line of defence, and assesses and communicates any deficiencies
found. Internal Audit, the third line of defence (3LoD), uses regu-
lar and independent audits to check that compliance in both the
1LoD and 2LoD is appropriate and effective.

Compliance risks are managed in a control circuit with inter-
acting elements. Commerzbank continually monitors relevant
regulatory requirements and defines and/or adapts corresponding
internal standards to ensure that the requirements are met.
Where necessitated by changes in requirements and standards,
internal training measures are defined and/or adapted and the
Bank’s units are advised how to implement these effectively. Im-
plementation encompasses setting up and carrying out suitable
processes and controls in daily work, assuring their quality and
testing their effectiveness. Compliance risks are monitored using
appropriate ratios, and regular internal monitoring reports are
produced. Where necessary, matters are escalated according to
their urgency and severity. A systematic risk analysis (compliance
risk assessment) is a core element of risk management. It assess-
es the inherent risk arising from doing business with different
customer groups and products and compares this with an assess-
ment of the corresponding control environment. It produces a
residual risk, the risk content of which is assessed. The Bank de-
fines measures to enhance risk management (e.g. introducing ad-
ditional controls) as necessary and tracks implementation closely.

In 2015 Commerzbank reached settlements with various US au-
thorities regarding violations of US sanctions and anti-money
laundering provisions. In terms of the findings relating to the set-
tlements the Bank has dealt with the majority of the findings. The
Bank has also received various interim reports and the final report
from the monitor appointed by the New York State Department of
Financial Services (“DFS”), to which it has responded with corre-
sponding implementation programmes. The Bank has made good
progress in carrying out the implementation programmes and has

Financial Statements and Management Report 2018

dealt with most of the measures. The DFS will confirm when the
monitorship ends. This decision has not yet been taken.

In line with the requirements of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), in 2017 Commerzbank London man-
dated a consulting company as a “skilled person”. The consulting
company carried out a review of existing structures and processes
(especially with regard to money laundering, financing of terror-
ism as well as sanctions/embargoes) and prepared a report for the
UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Commerzbank London
subsequently put in place a full-scale remediation project, the im-
plementation of which is being evaluated by the skilled person,
with half-yearly reports to the FCA. Here too Commerzbank has
made good progress in implementation.

Since 31 December 2012 Commerzbank has been provisionally
registered as a swap dealer with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trad-
ing Commission (CFTC). In accordance with the consent order is-
sued by the CFTC on 8 November 2018, Commerzbank will retain
an outside consultant to be approved by the CFTC for a period of
two years. The CFTC may extend this period by a further year at its
discretion, based on its assessment of Commerzbank’s remedial
efforts. During the review period the outside consultant will pro-
duce annual reports assessing the swap dealer’s compliance with
the Commodities Exchange Act and the regulations of the CFTC.
The report will also contain recommendations on improving the
swap dealer’s practices, policies and procedures. The outside con-
sultant will start work once the ongoing CFTC approval process has
been completed.

Reputational risk

Reputational risk is the risk that stakeholders may lose confidence
in Commerzbank or that its reputation may be damaged as a result
of negative events in its business activities. Commerzbank’s stake-
holder groups include in particular the public and the media, non-
governmental organisations and its customers. In the present-day
competitive environment, a company’s reputation is becoming
more and more important. The main factor determining this is how
companies handle sustainability considerations (environmental,
ethical or social risks) in the market segments’ customer business
(intrinsic reputational risks). Companies are judged not only on the
basis of people’s personal experiences of them, but also on reports
reaching the public, especially through the media. Reputational risk
therefore goes hand in hand with communication risk.

Strategy and organization All employees and managers have a
fundamental duty to protect and reinforce Commerzbank’s good
reputation as a significant element of its enterprise value. The
segments and significant subsidiaries bear direct responsibility for
reputational risk resulting from their particular business activity.
The Reputational Risk Management department is part of the cen-
tral Group Communications division of the Commerzbank Group
and focuses on intrinsic reputational risk that may directly lead to
reputational damage among stakeholder groups. The department
maintains close links with the relevant front office units. Manage-
ment of intrinsic reputational risk is the responsibility of the
Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors. It is a component of
Commerzbank’s overall risk strategy. Reputational Risk Manage-
ment's tasks include identifying, evaluating and addressing intrin-
sic reputational risk in systematic processes at an early stage and
suggesting or implementing appropriate measures (early warning
function).

Risk management Managing intrinsic reputational risk means
identifying and reacting to potential environmental, social and eth-
ical risks at an early stage, thereby reducing any potential com-
munication risk or even preventing it completely. Intrinsic reputa-
tional risk is managed by means of a qualitative approach. As part
of a structured process, transactions, products and customer rela-
tionships in connection with sensitive areas are assessed with ref-
erence to environmental, social and ethical risks on a qualitative
five-point scale. This assessment can contain conditions and in
some cases a negative verdict, which could lead to a rejection.

The sensitive areas regularly and comprehensively analysed in
Reputational Risk Management include armaments exports and
transactions, products and customer relationships relating to pow-
er generation and commodities extraction. Commerzbank’s atti-
tude towards these areas is laid down in positions and guidelines
that are binding for all employees. Commerzbank’s Reputational
Risk Management department regularly observes and analyses
new environmental, ethical and social issues and informs the rele-
vant parts of the Bank about these. The reputational risks identi-
fied and addressed by the department are incorporated into the
quarterly report on non-quantifiable risks and the quarterly report
on major and high reputational risks (sustainability risks) prepared
for the full Board of Managing Directors and the Risk Committee
of the Supervisory Board.

IT risk

IT risk is a form of operational risk. In our internal definition, we
define IT risk as risks to the security of information processed in
our systems in terms of meeting the four IT security objectives set
out below:

Confidentiality: Information is confidential if it is not accessible
to, or capable of being reconstructed by, unauthorised persons,
business processes or IT systems.

Integrity: Information possesses integrity if it has not been
modified or destroyed by any unauthorised means. An infor-
mation-processing system (IT system) possesses integrity if it can
perform its intended functions without hindrance and free of unau-
thorised manipulations, whether deliberate or accidental.

Traceability: Actions and technologies applied to information
are traceable if they themselves and their source can be traced
back without any ambiguity.

Availability: Information is available if it is always capable of
being used to a predefined extent by authorised persons, business
processes and IT systems when it is required.

Commerzbank attaches great importance to the protection and
security of its own information, of that entrusted to it by customers,
and of the business processes and systems used to process it. They
form a permanent core element in our IT strategy. The processing
of information is based increasingly on information technologies.
As such, our IT security requirements are at the heart of infor-
mation security management. IT security requirements are based
on the IT security objectives referred to above and are set down in
policies and procedural instructions.

IT risks are identified, evaluated and regularly reviewed as part
of IT governance processes. IT risk is covered in the quarterly IT
risk report. Information security is also established as a principal
objective for our Internal Control System.

Relevant IT risks are also evaluated as part of operational risk
management through risk scenarios and considered in the Bank’s
RWA calculation. This includes the risk of a breakdown of critical
IT, the risk of external attack on the systems or data of the Bank
(cyber crime and advanced persistent threat (APT)' scenarios), the
theft of corporate data or the default of service providers and ven-
dors. See also the description of cyber risk.

"An advanced persistent threat is a special form of cyber attack. The intention of an APT attack is to remain undetected for as long as
possible in order to steal sensitive information (internet espionage) or cause other types of damage over a longer period.


--- Page 70 ---

Given the major importance of IT security to Commerzbank, it
is further developed and improved on an ongoing basis by means
of strategic projects. We have taken into account the significance
of the “human” factor in IT security and cyber security by intro-
ducing additional training and awareness-raising measures.

Cyber risk

Cyber risk is regarded as extremely important, given the increase-
ing digitalisation of the Bank and its environment. For this reason,
cyber risk was classified as a material risk type during Commerz-
bank’s 2017 risk inventory.

Cyber risk comprises risks with direct relevance to security and
risks that lead to relevance to security (in each case, within cyber
space). The part of cyber space of relevance to Commerzbank is all
connected IT environments within the Bank and those outside the
Bank that lead to customers, business partners and service provid-
ers. Cyber risk is therefore concerned with the digital representa-
tion of the Bank’s assets (data, information) within cyber space.

Unlike information security risk, whose scope is limited to the
Bank and third-party companies with a business connection, the
scope of cyber risk extends to unknown persons, to take full
account of the requirement to protect their legitimate expecta-
tions when using cyber space.

The strategic guidelines from the overall risk strategy and the
information security strategy apply without limitation to cyber risk.

In order to prevent cyber risk organisationally, Commerzbank
has — in addition to the established governance processes of in-
formation security, the related risk reports on key risk indicators
and management via the Internal Control System (ICS) - set up a
cyber security programme focusing on specific aspects of cyber
security. The results of the cyber security programme feed both
the ICS and the Bank’s risk reporting.

Cyber risk is managed by Group Organisation & Security, which
reports to the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

Cyber risk generally has consequences for the Bank’s other
material risk types such as operational risk. These can be broken
down into direct and indirect consequences. In addition to the
operational risk, direct consequences relate to business risk,
credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. Indirect consequences
relate to investment portfolio risk, compliance risk, model risk,
physical asset risk, reputational risk and reserve risk. All conse-
quences are documented in the cyber sub-risk strategy and up-
dated on an ongoing basis.

Human resources risk

Human resources risk falls within the definition of operational
risk referred to in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).
The internal, management-oriented interpretation of this defini-
tion at Commerzbank includes the following elements in human
resources risk:

Adjustment risk: Adjustment risk results when organisational
and operational circumstances change (for example, restructuring,
changes in management culture, qualification needs), these
changes impact employees’ scope of responsibilities and therefore
require a greater willingness to change on the part of the staff. We
offer selected internal and external training, continuing education
and change programmes to ensure that the qualification levels of
our employees keep pace with the current requirements, guidance
is provided for structural changes and our employees can fulfil
their duties and responsibilities.

Motivation risk: Motivation risk arises when demotivating fac-
tors are not eliminated and employees do not adequately perceive
motivating factors such as management or remuneration. The ef-
fects (such as withheld performance by employees) can have a
direct impact on the working environment and the organisation’s
productivity. Employee surveys enable us to respond as quickly as
possible to potential changes in our employees’ level of corporate
loyalty and to initiate adequate measures.

Departure risk: Departure risk takes into account the conse-
quences of undesired employee departures (for example, if an
employee resigns voluntarily), particularly when high performers
are involved. We take great care to ensure that the absence or de-
parture of employees does not result in long-term disruptions to
our operations. We also monitor staff turnover on a regular basis
from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective.

Supply risk: Supply risk reflects the consequences of insuffi-
cient staffing (for example, inadequate development of young staff)
and the resulting consequences (operating bottlenecks, increased
workload, lower productivity and illness). Appropriate quantitative
and qualitative staffing aims to ensure that internal operating
requirements, business activities and Commerzbank’s strategy can
be implemented.

Employees are a key resource for Commerzbank. Human
resources risk is systematically managed by Group Human
Resources with the aim of identifying, assessing and managing
risks, for instance by applying selected personnel tools. The
Board of Managing Directors is regularly informed about human

resources risk.

In addition, systematic and strategic personnel planning helps
to put the management of medium- and long-term human
resources risks on a more professional footing. This has been in-
troduced gradually into the Bank’s strategically relevant business
areas since 2015.

Overall, the Bank will continue to monitor human resources
risk. There is a risk that the human resources risk situation may
deteriorate due to the impending structural changes under the
“Commerzbank 4.0” strategy. Change and organisational measures
have already been initiated to counter human resources risk.

Business strategy risk

Business strategy risk is the medium- to long-term risk of negative
influences on the achievement of Commerzbank’s strategic goals,
for example as a result of changes in the market or competitive
environment, capital market requirements, regulatory/political fac-
tors or the inadequate implementation of the Group strategy (pri-
mary risk drivers).

Group strategy is developed further in a process that takes both
external and internal factors into account. On the basis of these
factors, the full Board of Managing Directors sets out a sustainable
business strategy describing the major business activities and
steps required to meet the targets. To ensure proper implement-
tation of the Group strategy to achieve the business targets, stra-
tegic controls are carried out through regular monitoring of quan-
titative and qualitative targets in the Group and the segments.

Disclaimer Commerzbank’s internal risk measurement methods
and models which form the basis for the calculation of the figures
shown in this report are state-of-the-art and based on banking
sector practice. The risk models produce results appropriate to
the management of the Bank. The measurement approaches are
regularly reviewed by risk control and internal audit as well as by
German and European supervisory authorities. Despite being
carefully developed and regularly checked, models cannot cover

Responsibility for strategic corporate management lies with the
full Board of Managing Directors. Specific business policy deci-
sions (acquisition and sale of equity holdings representing >1% of
Commerzbank AG’s eligible capital) also require the authorisation
of the Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee. All major investments
are subject to careful review by the full Board of Managing Direc-
tors.

Model risk

Model risk is the risk of incorrect management decisions based
upon an inaccurate depiction of reality by the models used. With
regard to the causes of model risk we distinguish between model
risk from exceeding model boundaries and model risk from model
errors (manual errors in model development/implementation). In
line with the focus of the Group risk strategy, namely to ensure
that the Bank has adequate capital and liquidity, the models for
assessing risk-bearing capacity (capital requirements under the
Basel framework) and liquidity resources are central for risk man-
agement.

The basic principles of model risk management are the identifi-
cation and avoidance of model risks and appropriate consideration
of known model risks (e.g. through conservative calibration or
consideration of model reserves). Model risks that are unknown
and hence cannot be mitigated are accepted as an inherent risk in
the complexity of the Commerzbank business model. In respect of
the governance of model risk management requirements relating
to model validation and model changes are established.

all the influencing factors that have an impact in reality or illus-
trate their complex behaviour and interactions. These limits to risk
modelling apply in particular in extreme situations. Supplementary
stress tests and scenario analyses can only show examples of the
risks to which a portfolio may be exposed in extreme market situa-
tions. However, stress-testing all imaginable scenarios is not fea-
sible. Stress tests cannot offer a final estimate of the maximum loss

should an extreme event occur.
