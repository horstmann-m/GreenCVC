In Distribution, our travel agency air bookings increased by 5.9%, to 534.9 million

In IT Solutions, our total Passengers Boarded were 85.0% higher, reaching 1,382.5 million

Revenue expanded by 14.3%, to €4,472.9 million

EBITDA increased by 16.0%, to €1,700.1 million

Adjusted profit’ grew by 21.2%, to €911.0 million

Free Cash Flow amounted to €811.4 million, representing growth of 23.1%

Covenant net financial debt was €1,957.5 million at December 31, 2016 (1.14 times last-twelve-
month covenant EBITDA)

Amadeus continued to progress positively through the fourth quarter of 2016, delivering another
successful year of double-digit growth. In 2016, Revenue grew by 14.3% and EBITDA increased 16.0%,
supporting Adjusted Profit growth of 21.2%. These results were driven by the positive performances
of our Distribution and IT Solutions segments, as well as by the contribution from our 2015 (Hotel
SystemsPro, Itesso, AirlT) and 2016 (Navitaire) acquisitions.

In Distribution and during the quarter, we successfully renewed or signed content agreements with 8
carriers - 46 in total over 2016 - as we continue to secure and expand content for our subscribers. Our
air volumes continued to grow at a strong pace, driven by a 0.6 p.p. improvement of our competitive
position? in the quarter (0.8 p.p. in the year), further increasing our relevance to travel providers. As
in the past quarters, Asia Pacific continued to be our fastest-growing region, expanding at a dou
digit rate. In 2016, our TA air bookings increased by 5.9% and Distribution Revenue grew 6.8%.

e

Merchandising solutions remain key for the airlines and at Amadeus we are committed to supporting
our customers in realising their full revenue potential. At quarter-end, 66% of air bookings processed
through Amadeus could carry an attached ancillary service and 120 airlines had contracted Amadeus
Airline Ancillary Services for the indirect channel. Additionally, Amadeus Fare Families Solution had 52
contracted customers and more than 40 online travel agencies (including Fareportal and Ozon, in the
fourth quarter), had integrated Amadeus merchandising solutions at year-end.

In 2016, IT Solutions revenue expanded by 31.7%. This expansion was driven by (i) underlying dou
digit growth, plus (ii) the consolidation of Navitaire and the full-year impact of our 2015 acquisitions.
Total Passengers Boarded increased by 85.0% due to the inclusion of Navitaire’s Passengers Boarded
(since late January 2016). Altéa Passengers Boarded grew 12.2%, positively impacted by organic
growth and the migrations we have undertaken in the last twelve months: most importantly China
Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines and Brussels Airlines (both part of the Lufthansa Group). All our
Airline IT activities continued to grow well, supported by successful upselling activity with new
contracts and implementations of DCS, e-commerce and standalone solutions in the areas of revenue
optimisation and merchandising as well as by underlying organic growth.

In October, Ukraine International Airlines, the largest airline in Ukraine, implemented Altéa
(Reservation and Inventory). In November, we announced Kuwait Airways had contracted a complete
suite of Altéa solutions, including Revenue Management, e-Commerce, Loyalty Programmes,
Inventory, Reservation, Departure Control, Payments, as well as Mobile and Travel Intelligence.

We were also pleased to announce at the beginning of 2017, that Ryanair had renewed its Passenger
Service Systems agreement with Navitaire. Ryanair will continue using Navitaire’s advanced ancillary
and reservations solution including merchandising, distribution, digital and departure control
platforms until 2025, representing 25 years of collaboration between Ryanair and Navitaire.

We are making progress in our new businesses. We are advancing in the execution of our Hospitality
IT strategy, by integrating Itesso and Hotel SystemsPro and by working with InterContinental Hotels
Group (IHG) in the development of a new-generation Guest Reservation System for the hospitality
industry. IHG and Amadeus plan to initiate a progressive roll-out in the fourth quarter of 2017 with
the aim to complete the roll-out by the end of 2018. We are also progressing in the development of a
next-generation Property Management System.

We continue to maintain a disciplined focus on technology. Our investment in R&D represented
15.8% of revenue in 2016. It was dedicated to support long-term growth through new customer
implementations, product evolution, portfolio expansion, investment in new businesses and
continued shift to open systems and cloud-based architecture, as well as system performance
optimisation.

Our free cash flow grew 23.1% over 2016, to €811.4 million and our consolidated covenant net
financial debt stood at €1,957.5 million at the end of the year, representing 1.14 times last-twelve-
month covenant EBITDA.

In December 2016, the Board of Directors proposed a 50% pay-out target ratio for 2016. Accordingly,
the Board of Directors will submit a final gross dividend of €0.94 per share from the 2016 reported
profit to the General Shareholders Meeting for approval in June 2017, representing an increase of
21.3% vs. 2015. An interim gross dividend of €0.40 per share was paid on February 1, 2017. The
complementary dividend of €0.54 per share will be paid after the General Shareholders Meeting
approval.

2 Operating Review

2.1 Key recent business highlights

The following section includes selected business highlights for 2016.
Arline Distribution

In 2016, over 70% of airline bookings made through the Amadeus system were with airlines that had
content agreements with Amadeus. During this year, new contracts or renewals of existing content
agreements were signed with 46 carriers, including Emirates, LATAM Airlines Group, Etihad Airways,
easyJet and Kenia Airways.

Low cost content is increasingly demanded among corporate travellers. Subscribers to Amadeus’
inventory can now access content of more than 90 low cost and hybrid carriers worldwide, including
Chinese low cost carrier Spring Airlines, which signed a content agreement in April, amongst others.

Our customers continued to contract our merchandising solutions. At the end of the year 66% of the
bookings made through the Amadeus system were eligible to carry a merchandising item, and more
than 40 global online travel agencies (including Fareportal and Ozon, in the fourth quarter), had
integrated Amadeus merchandising solutions.

At year-end, 120 airlines had contracted Amadeus Airline Ancillary Services to be able to offer
ancillary services in the indirect channel (of which 91 had implemented the solution). At the end of
the year, 165 airlines had contracted Amadeus Airline Ancillary Services to be able to offer ancillary
services in the indirect or the direct channel or both (of which 125 had been implemented at ye
end).

ar-

In turn, the Amadeus Fare Families solution, which allows airlines worldwide to distribute branded
fares to travellers in the indirect channel, continued its expansion. At the end of the year, 52 airlines
had contracted the solution, out of which 33 had implemented it.

KAYAK, the world’s leading travel search engine, implemented Amadeus Master Pricer with Instant
Search technology in October. This revolutionary solution delivers online search results in milliseconds
without compromising accuracy. Every one second of improvement in search response time for
consumers can translate into an increase in conversion rates.

In 2016, Amadeus launched two innovative products: Amadeus Ticket Changer Shopper (ATC) and
Amadeus Selling Platform Connect. ATC is the world’s first self-service online rebooking solution that
allows travellers to further personalise their bookings. In turn, Amadeus Selling Platform Connect is
the world’s first fully cloud-based GDS booking and fulfilment platform, available in any device
without the hassle of a complicated installation.

In 2016, both Malaysia Airlines and Kuwait Airways selected Amadeus as their new Passenger Services
System provider. Swiss International Air Lines, Brussels Airlines, Ukraine International Airlines and
China Airlines were among the airlines that implemented the Amadeus Altéa solutions during 2016.
Also, Viva Group signed with Navitaire and was successfully migrated to New Skies, allowing
VivaColombia and VivaAerobus to serve more customers and add additional destinations.

At the beginning of 2017, Ryanair renewed its Passenger Services System agreement with Navitaire
until 2025. The airline will continue using the firm’s advanced ancillary and reservations solutions New
Skies, including merchandising, distribution, digital and departure control platforms.

The Lufthansa Group, which was already an Altéa Reservation, Inventory and Departure Control
Customer Management user, contracted to complete the full Amadeus Altéa Suite across all its
network carriers through the addition of Amadeus Altéa Departure Control Flight Management.

Virgin Australia also implemented Amadeus Altéa Departure Control Flight Management for its
aircraft control processes and to benefit from Altéa operational excellence for fuel savings, agent
productivity and flight safety.

Avianca renewed its commitment to Amadeus Altéa Suite long term, and also became the launch
customer for Amadeus Anytime Merchandising. As such, Avianca will benefit from unique
merchandising capabilities including the ability to reach more travellers at any stage of their trip
through the Amadeus global travel ecosystem, and advanced segmentation capabilities and support
for many different types of ancillary services that will help the airline deliver on travellers’
expectations by providing relevant and attractive offers throughout the entire trip cycle. Avianca is
also launching Amadeus Customer Experience Management, allowing Avianca to intimately
understand its customers and deliver highly personalised offers.

Malaysia Airlines selected, on top of the Amadeus Passenger Service System solution mentioned
above, Amadeus Anytime Merchandising and our e-commerce solutions to transform its passenger
services, explore and develop new revenue streams and improve the online shopping experience for
travellers.

Swiss International Air Lines and Amadeus announced a partnership to develop Amadeus Passenger
Recovery, a new tool that will allow the airline to re-accommodate disrupted passengers and which
will be integrated with the Altéa Suite.

Eva Air migrated to Amadeus Altéa Revenue Management Suite, which will enable the airline to price
airline packages and offers based on travellers’ price sensitivity and travel purpose. Singapore Airlines
also contracted this solution in addition to Amadeus Dynamic Pricing and Amadeus Group Manager.

TAP Portugal implemented Amadeus Rich Merchandising in the last quarter of 2016. This product
allows the airlines’ customers and partners to see images of exactly what they’re booking.

During the summer, Amadeus became one of the first industry players to receive the highest level (3)
of NDC certification from IATA. Airlines using Amadeus’ new Altéa NDC solution will have the option
to distribute their prices and fares, including ancillary and fare family content, using NDC Offers &
Orders. This was shortly followed by Navitaire receiving the highest level of NDC certification as well.

Hospitality

During the year, we have continued working with Intercontinental Hotels Group in the development
of a new-generation Guest Reservation System for the hospitality industry, and the integration of
Itesso and Hotels SystemsPro acquisitions.

In August, Amadeus and Zingle, a leading provider of mobile messaging software platforms,
announced a partnership to integrate Zingle’s technology with Amadeus’ hospitality optimisation
solutions. Thanks to this partnership hotels will be able to integrate the mobile texting and messaging
technology they need to better service and communicate with their clients.

Amadeus signed a partnership with DerbySoft, a market leader in hospitality distribution technology,
to connect hotels of all sizes to metasearch engines and online travel agents.

Airport IT

Looking for a more efficient passenger departure experience, as well as, substantially reduce costs
and energy consumption, in March Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport announced that it
will implement Amadeus Airport Common Use Service (ACUS). Also ASA, which owns Cape Verde’s
seven airports and ground handling company Cabo Verde Handling, contracted Amadeus Airport
Common Use Service (ACUS) and Altéa Departure Control in four international airports.

At the beginning of the year, Copenhagen Airports and Amadeus announced that the company that
owns and operates the Copenhagen airports of Kastrup and Roskilde had chosen to harness the
power of the cloud through a ten-year IT partnership with Amadeus, which included Airport
Collaborative Decision Making Portal, Airport Operational Database and Baggage Reconciliation
System solutions. At the end of the year, Copenhagen Airports had successfully implemented
Amadeus Airport Sequence Manager and A-CDM Portal solutions.

Rail
AccesRail, an IATA travel partner and content aggregator specialising in intermodal travel,
strengthened its commitment to a door-to-door travel future through an extended partnership with
Amadeus. Using Amadeus’ Air-Rail Display, travel agents are now able to book 18 rail and bus

operators across 26 countries on the same screen as air travel. This link allows railways to broaden
their reach in a key sales channel and increase revenue.

Travel Intelligence

Amadeus launched two new innovative solutions in 2016: Amadeus Performance Insight, a cloud-
based open architecture solution that allows airlines of all sizes to better understand their
performance and use that data to take more informed business decisions; and Amadeus Booking
Analytics, a solution used by airlines to monitor bookings using different criteria (such as per route,
per agency point of sale or per airline) and act upon them.

Payments

During the first quarter of 2016 Amadeus launched B2B Wallet Prepaid, a virtual card payment
solution which allows travel agencies to improve cash flow management when paying for travel
content. Later in 2016 the offering was enhanced through two key partnerships: A partnership with
MasterCard, to offer travel agencies payment acceptance and security worldwide, as well as further
protection against supplier default in B2B Wallet. A second partnership with Ixaris, allowing travel
agencies to easily create and add funds to their virtual payment cards.

Mobile

Amadeus and The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) launched a new itinerary management app for the
consulting firm’s entire workforce worldwide. This new app is based on Amadeus Mobile Platform and
was personalised for BCG’s travel needs.

Additional news for 2016

For the fifth consecutive year, Amadeus earned the prestigious recognition of being included in the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index in the IT & Internet Software and Services sector. The Dow Jones
Sustainability Indices (DJSI) are made up of global sustainability leaders based on economic,
environmental, and social criteria; and are widely regarded as the most prominent standards for
evaluating sustainability performance available to investors.

An independent London School of Economics study commissioned by Amadeus, “Travel distribution:
the end of the world as we know it?”, finds that gatekeepers, ‘mega meta online travel agencies’, an
artificial intelligence are changing the future of travel distribution. The paper draws insights from
business leader interviews, data analysis and a major sector-specific survey spanning all globa
markets.

Amadeus also commissioned a new report on Airline Disruption. Written by T2RL, the report finds
that incidents such as bad weather, natural disasters and strike action all contribute to air trave
disruption, which costs airlines up to $60 billion annually in lost revenues, equating to 8% of globa
industry revenues.

In November 2016, Laurens Leurink was appointed Senior Vice President, Distribution, Amadeus,
taking over from Holger Taubmann. Laurens brings financial, commercial and strategic acumen as wel
as deep travel industry knowledge to Amadeus. Laurens has been a member of the Executive
Committee of Amadeus since January 2017.

2.2 Key ongoing R&D projects

As a leading and differentiated technology provider for the travel industry, Amadeus undertakes
significant R&D activities. In 2016, R&D investment related primarily to:

The audited consolidated financial statements of Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and subsidiaries are the
source to the financial information included in this document and have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.

Certain amounts and figures included in this report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Any

Measures have been prepared in accordance with the Guidelines issued by the European Securities
and Markets Authority for regulated information published on or after July 3, 2016.

EBITDA corresponds to the segment contributions less net indirect costs as defined in note 6
‘Segment Reporting’ of the Consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

Covenant net financial debt is defined as current and non-current debt, less cash and cash
equivalents, adjusted for non-debt items (such as deferred financing fees, accrued interest and
fair value adjustments to an EIB loan). A reconciliation to the financial statements is included in
section 6.2.5.

Adjusted profit corresponds to the reported Profit for the period, after adjusting for: (i)
accounting effects derived from PPA exercises and impairment losses, (ii) non-operating exchange
gains (losses), and (iii) other non-recurring items, as detailed in section 6.1.8.

We believe that these measures provide useful and relevant information to facilitate a better
understanding of the performance of Amadeus and its economic position. These measures are not
standard and therefore may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

When we refer to our competitive position, we consider our TA air bookings in relation to the TA air
booking industry, defined as the total volume of travel agency air bookings processed by the global
CRS. It excludes air bookings made directly through in-house airline systems or single country
operators, the latter primarily in China, Japan and Russia, which together combined represent an
important part of the industry.

necessary regulatory approvals and the closing took place on January 26, 2016. The cash
consideration in relation to this acquisition amounted to €760.1 million. The acquisition was 100%
debt-financed, partially through the drawing of the €500 million bank loan facility executed on July 3,
2015 (structured as a “club deal” financing entered into with twelve banks, with maturity dates in
2019 and 2020 though cancelled and replaced in October 2016 by a four-year bond), and partially

the acquisition, incurred in the second half of 2015, were reported as indirect costs as of year-end
2015.

33 Divestments completed in 2016
Meeting Intelligence business

On July 21, 2016, Amadeus Hospitality US (formerly Newmarket International) divested its non-core

and, as of December 31, 2015 the Group owned 70.26% of the shares of i:FAO. As a result of the
tender offer, Amadeus has increased its shareholding in i:FAO to 88.725%. The total amount paid for
the shares acquired through the tender offer was €28.6 million (€30.0 per share). i:FAO has now been
delisted from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

4 Main financial risks and hedging policy
41 Foreign exchange rate risk

Our reporting currency is the Euro. However, as a result of Amadeus’ global activity and presence,
part of our results are generated in currencies different from the Euro and therefore are impacted by
foreign exchange fluctuations. Similarly, part of our cash inflows and outflows are denominated in
non-Euro currencies.

Our revenue is almost entirely generated either in Euro or in US Dollar (the latter representing 30%-
35% of our total revenue). Revenue generated in currencies other than the Euro or US Dollar is
negligible.

In turn, 40%-50% of our operating costs® are denominated in many currencies different from the
Euro, including the USD which represents 20%-30% of our operating costs. The rest of the foreign
currency operating expenses are denominated in a variety of currencies, GBP, INR, AUD and SEK being
the most significant. A number of these currencies may fluctuate vs. the Euro similarly to the US
Dollar - Euro fluctuations, and the degree of this correlation may vary with time.

Amadeus’ target is to reduce the volatility generated by foreign exchange fluctuations on its non-Euro
denominated net cash flows. Our hedging strategy is as follows:

To manage our exposure to the US Dollar, we have a natural hedge to our net operating cash flow
generated in US Dollar through, among others, payments of USD-denominated debt (when
applicable) and taxes paid in the US. We enter into derivative arrangements when this natural
hedge is not sufficient to cover our outstanding exposure.

We also hedge a number of currencies, including the GBP, AUD and INR, for which we enter into
foreign exchange derivatives with banks.

When the hedges in place qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS, profits and losses are recognised
within the revenue caption (under the non booking revenue line of Distribution). Our hedging
arrangements typically qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS.

In 2016, the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations on revenue was negligible. However, the
appreciation of the euro vs. several currencies (GBP, ARS, INR and ZAR for example) had a positive
impact on costs, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Excluding foreign exchange impacts and Navitaire,
EBITDA margin was broadly stable and underlying EBITDA growth was at a high single-digit rate.

42 Interest rate risk

Our target is to reduce volatility in net interest flows. In order to achieve this objective, Amadeus may
enter into interest rate hedging agreements (interest rate swaps, caps, collars) to cover the floating
rate debt.

At December 31, 2016, 24.3% of our total covenant financial debt was subject to floating interest
rates, indexed to the EURIBOR. As of this date no interest rate hedges were in place.

3 Including Cost of revenue, Personnel expenses and Other operating expenses. Excludes Depreciation and amortization.

(millions of euros)

The increase in the percentage of total covenant financial debt subject to floating interest rates vs.
prior year is mostly due to a higher use of the European Commercial Paper programme and revolving
credit facilities, as described in section 6.2.5, which are subject to floating interest rates.

43 Own shares price evolution risk
Amadeus has three different staff remuneration schemes which are settled with Amadeus’ shares.

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature, their beneficiaries will receive a number of
Amadeus shares which for the outstanding plans will be (depending on the evolution of certain
performance conditions) between a minimum of 267,000 shares and a maximum of 1,817,000 shares,
approximately. It is Amadeus’ intention to make use of its treasury shares to settle these plans at their
maturity.

The solid growth we achivedearlier in the year continued in the last quarter of 2016. Revenue
increased 14.6% in the fourth quarter, driving full year revenue to €4,472.9 million, 14.3% higher than
in 2015. Revenue growth was driven by the positive evolution of our segments.

In Distribution, revenue increased 6.8% in the year, supported by booking growth and expansive
average pricing.
IT Solutions delivered a 31.7% revenue increase in 2016, resulting from underlying double-digit
growth, as well as from the consolidation of Navitaire and our 2015 acquisitions. (See sections 3.1
and 3.2 for more details on acquisitions).

EBITDA expanded 16.0% in the year, supported by growth in contributions of Distribution (3.9%) and
IT Solutions (36.8%). This growth was partially offset by net indirect costs, which increased 19.3%,
highly impacted by the consolidation of Navitaire’s central costs (excluding Navitaire’s costs, indirect
costs grew at a mid-single digit rate). EBITDA margin expanded 0.6 p.p. in the year, representing
38.0% of revenue in 2016 and was broadly stable excluding foreign exchange impacts and Navitaire.

Distribution includes our Global Distribution System business (including not only airline content but
also hospitality and rail content, amongst others). We also provide solutions and services related to
the distribution of content through the GDS to travel providers (such as solutions for the display and
management of merchandising content), to travel sellers (such as search solutions and integrated
front-, mid- and back-office solutions) and to corporations (such as self-booking tools and travel and
expense management solutions). In addition, Distribution includes our Travel Intelligence business
and part of our Payments offering (the Payer Hub, through which we help travel agencies and
corporations pay travel providers).

Distribution delivered 6.8% revenue growth in 2016, supported by higher volumes coupled with
average pricing expansion. Amadeus’ volumes once again outperformed the travel agency air booking
industry, fuelled by a notable improvement of 0.8 p.p. in our competitive position. In this context,
however, the Distribution contribution grew at a slower pace (3.9% in the year). As a percentage of
revenue, Distribution contribution, which was impacted by competitive pressure and a negative
country mix, declined by 1.2 p.p., to 41.8%.

TA air booking industry

Industry travel agency air bookings ended the year very solidly with a 5.6% increase in the fourth
quarter. Latin America and Asia and Pacific were the fastest growing regions in the quarter. Growth
accelerated vs. the first nine months of the year in all regions except Middle East and Africa. This was
mainly driven by continued strong underlying growth in Asia and Pacific, recovery in specific countries
(Russia, Argentina, Brazil) and a relatively lower base of comparison, as the end of 2015 was impacted
by terrorist attacks.

In the year, the TA air booking industry increased by 3.1%. Asia and Pacific experienced robust
growth, fuelled by the strong performance of South Korea or India, among others. Despite an
improvement in the second half of the year, Central Eastern and Southern Europe was the weakest
region, dragged by unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. The remaining regions (Western Europe,
Middle East and Africa and the Americas) grew moderately overall during the year.

Amadeus bookings

Amadeus TA air bookings growth accelerated to 8.4% in the last quarter of 2016. Our performance
was particularly strong in Western Europe, Latin America and Asia and Pacific, supported by the TA air
industry acceleration mentioned above and an improvement of our competitive position in these
regions.

In 2016, our competitive position improved 0.8 p.p. to 43.2% and led to a 5.9% increase in Amadeus
TA air bookings. Amadeus’ volumes grew fastest in Asia and Pacific (16.7%), benefitting from robust
industry growth and the enhancement of our competitive position. Our TA air bookings in North
America and Middle East and Africa increased solidly while volumes in Western Europe and Latin
America, supported by a strong fourth quarter, closed the year with healthy growth rates. In turn,
Central Eastern and Southern Europe suffered from the industry weakness in the year.

bookings declined 1.3%, due to lower rail bookings, which more than offset the positive evolution of
hotel and car bookings.

Revenue 705.1 650.2 8.4% 2,925.0 2,737.8 6.8%

Revenue in the Distribution segment increased by 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016, supported by
higher bookings and expansive average pricing.

For the full year, Distribution revenue increased by 6.8%, as a result of higher booking and non
booking revenue:

Booking revenue growth of 7.7% resulted from a 5.1% increase in bookings coupled with a 2.4%
expansion in the average fee per booking. This increase in the unitary fee was driven by the
positive effects from customer renegotiations and booking mix (both from a higher weight of
global bookings, and a decrease in the weight of rail bookings, with a lower average fee than air
bookings).

Non booking revenue increased 1.3% in 2016 vs. prior year, impacted by a number of factors,
including the negative effect from the cancellation provision’. The underlying non booking
revenue growth was driven by (i) search solutions provided to metasearch engines and online
travel agencies, (ii) enhanced functionalities provided to travel agencies (online and offline) and

“ The cancellation provision corresponds to the estimated amount of booking fees which will be refunded to the airlines due to booking
cancellations and is included as a negative amount within non booking revenue.

5.1.3 Contribution

The contribution of our Distribution segment is calculated after deducting from our revenue those
operating costs which can be directly allocated to the segment (variable costs, mainly related to
distribution fees and incentives, and product development, marketing and commercial costs).

In 2016, Distribution contribution amounted to €1,223.0 million, 3.9% higher than in 2015. The
increase in contribution was supported by higher revenue partially offset by growth in costs. As a
percentage of revenue, in 2016, contribution represented 41.8%. Contribution was impacted by non-
recurring effects linked to certain personnel-related payments, local tax provisions and bad debt
provisions, amongst others, included in the segment’s net operating costs.

Excluding these non-recurring effects, net operating costs growth was due to:

Growth in incentives and distribution fees, driven by a 5.9% increase in travel agency air bookings
and a unitary distribution cost expansion, as a consequence of (i) competitive pressure and (ii) an
increase in weight of countries which have a higher unit distribution cost, for example India.
Higher fixed costs, which resulted from:

e Annual salary and variable remuneration reviews.

e  Alimited increase in our core Distribution commercial resources.

e The expansion of our R&D and commercial teams dedicated to corporate IT (i:FAO),
advertising (Travel Audience) and Travel Intelligence, as well as the consolidation impact of
Pyton.

e A reduction in the overall capitalisation ratio of the segment, impacted by the mix of
projects undertaken and the acceleration in activities within certain businesses with lower
capitalisation ratios.

A positive foreign exchange impact.

with the impact from the 2015 and 2016 implementations (mainly All Nippon Airways and Thomas
Cook Group Airlines, in 2015, and Swiss International Air Lines, Brussels Airlines and China Airlines, in
2016) drove our volumes up by 12.3% in the fourth quarter, or 12.2% in the full year.

Navitaire contributed 544.1 million passengers to our 2016 passengers boarded (consolidated since
January 26, 2016 and equivalent to 577.6 million passengers for the full year). Passengers boarded on
the New Skies platform performed well in the year, growing double-digit organically and also
benefitting from implementations such as Viva Group.

Additionally, Navitaire has supported the expansion of our international footprint. Asia and Pacific and
North America gained relative weight in the year, representing 31.0% and 4.7% respectively. The shift
towards these regions will continue as we implement the contracted migrations of Southwest Airlines
(the domestic passengers business), Japan Airlines and Malaysia Airlines.

T Transactional revenue amounted to €1,142.1 million in 2016, expanding 41.1% vs. 2015, driven by:

The consolidation impact from our acquisitions, most notably Navitaire.

A strong double-digit underlying growth in our Airline IT business, fuelled by a 12.2% increase in
Altéa Passengers Boarded and expansive average pricing, reflecting our successful upselling
activity, primarily through implementations of Altéa Departure Control Systems, e-commerce and
standalone solutions.

The growing contribution from our Airport IT solutions, in particular in the passenger processing
area, and from our Payments Merchant Hub, through which we help travel merchants get paid.

Direct Distribution Transactional Revenue

Direct distribution revenue includes (i) fees charged for bookings made through the direct sales
channel of an airline using our Altéa Reservation solution and for certain types of air bookings made
through the direct sales channel of Altéa customers for which we charge a booking fee, not a PB fee,
and (ii) fees charged to airlines using our Altéa Reservation solution for complementary functionalities
that are closely related to the booking process.

Revenue from Direct Distribution increased by 5.7% in 2016, supported by organic growth in
bookings.

Non Transactional Revenue

Non-transactional revenue comprises among others, (i) the recognition of deferred customisation and
implementation fees of our solutions, (ii) the provision of bespoke services, application hosting and
other customer support services and (iii) revenues related to our Hospitality IT solutions.

Non transactional revenue increased by 13.5% in 2016 vs. prior year, as a combination of:

Organic growth delivered by Hospitality IT, mainly in the Sales & Catering business (despite the
negative impact from the divestment of a non-core Meeting Intelligence business in July 2016, as
explained in section 3.3 of this report), and by Airline IT, mostly from the recognition of previously
deferred revenue (which starts to be recognised after a customer implementation takes place) as
well as from e-commerce related services.

The contribution of our 2015 acquisitions and Navitaire.

5.2.3 Contribution

The contribution of IT Solutions is calculated after deducting from our revenue those operating costs
which can be directly allocated to this segment (variable costs, including certain distribution fees and
product development, marketing and commercial costs).

In 2016, the contribution of IT Solutions reached €1,040.7 million, 36.8% higher than prior year. As a
percentage of revenue, the segment contribution expanded to 67.2%, 2.5 p.p. higher than in 2015.

The increase in contribution was driven by revenue growth of 31.7% (as explained in section 5.2.2
above), partly offset by an increase in net operating costs of 22.5% (resulting from 16.0% growth in
gross operating costs and a 2.5% increase in capitalisations). All captions were highly impacted by the
consolidation of Navitaire and the 2015 acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the IT Solutions segment
contribution grew at a strong double-digit rate.

The underlying growth in net operating costs was mainly due to:

Annual salary and variable remuneration reviews.
A reinforcement of our commercial teams to better support the expansion of our product offering
and customer base.

Higher R&D expenditure dedicated to (i) our Airline IT portfolio evolution and expansion (in
particular in the areas of merchandising, shopping and personalisation) as well as services, and (ii)
our new businesses (mainly related to the development and implementation of our next-
generation Guest Reservation System under our agreement with InterContinental Hotels Group).

A decline in the IT Solutions capitalisation ratio impacted by the mix of projects undertaken, as
well as by a higher weight of activities which are not capitalised (such as bespoke developments
or e-commerce related services).

A positive foreign exchange impact.

5.3 EBITDA

In 2016, EBITDA increased by 16.0% to €1,700.1 million. EBITDA margin represented 38.0% of
revenue in 2016, 0.6 p.p. higher than in 2015. Excluding foreign exchange impacts and Navitaire,
margins remained broadly stable and EBITDA grew at a high single-digit rate.

EBITDA growth was the result of the positive underlying performances of Distribution and IT
Solutions. The contribution from our latest acquisitions (most notably Navitaire) and certain foreign
exchange effects impacting positively the evolution of our cost base, also supported our EBITDA
growth in 2016 (see section 4.1 for details on the exposure of our operating results to foreign
exchange fluctuations).

Distribution and IT Solutions contributions were partly offset by higher net indirect costs, which grew
19.3% in 2016. This was the result of gross indirect costs increasing by 16.6% and capitalisations by
7.8%.

Indirect costs were highly impacted by the consolidation of Navitaire central costs (such as costs
related to hosting in Accenture’s data centres). Excluding these Navitaire costs, total indirect costs
increased at a mid-single digit rate, mainly driven by:

Annual salary and variable remuneration reviews.

Additional resources to expand our corporate structure following our business and geographical
expansion.

An increase in expenses related to cross area development and data centre projects (including the
shift to open systems, in its final stage, and to cloud-based architecture), though most of these
projects are capitalised.

A positive foreign exchange impact.

Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 amounted to €1,086.4 million, growing 14.6% over prior year.
For the full year 2016, revenue increased by 14.3% to €4,472.9 million.

This increase was supported by the positive evolution of Distribution and IT Solutions and by the
contribution of our latest acquisitions, mainly Navitaire. Overall, revenue growth was a combination
of:

An increase of 8.4% in our Distribution segment in the fourth quarter of 2016, leading to 6.8%
growth for the full year period.

An increase of 28.1% in our IT Solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 31.7% in the
full year.

See sections 5.1.2. and 5.2.2. for more details on revenue growth within Distribution and IT Solutions.

Revenue 1,086.4 947.9 14.6% 4,472.9 3,912.7 14.3%

6.1.2 Cost of revenue

These costs are mainly related to: (i) incentive fees paid to travel agencies, (ii) distribution fees paid to
those local commercial organisations which act as a local distributor (mainly in the Middle East, North
Africa, India, and South Korea) and (iii) data communication expenses related to the maintenance of
our computer network, including connection charges.

Cost of revenue amounted to €286.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, 13.0% higher than in the
same period of 2015, driving full year growth to 10.1%. This increase was mostly the result of:

A 5.9% increase in travel agency air bookings.

A higher unitary distribution cost, resulting from (i) competitive pressure and (ii) an increase in
weight of countries which have a higher unit distribution cost, for example India.

A positive foreign exchange impact.

As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue declined to 25.7% in 2016, 1.0 p.p. less than in 2015.

6.1.3 Personnel and related expenses and other operating expenses

A large part of Amadeus’ employees are software developers. Amadeus also hires contractors to
support its development activity, complementing the permanent staff. The overall ratio of permanent
staff vs. contractors devoted to R&D fluctuates depending on business needs and project mix,
therefore impacting the evolution of both “Personnel expenses” and “Other operating expenses”
captions in our income statement.

(millions of euros)

Our combined operating expenses cost line, including both Personnel expenses and Other operating
expenses, grew by 15.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 vs. the same quarter of 2015, or 15.7% in the
year vs. 2015.

Personnel expenses + Other (429.7) (371.1) 15.8% (1,611.5) (1,393.0) 15.7%
operating expenses

Fixed operating expenses were highly impacted by (i) the consolidation of Navitaire (particularly
affecting personnel and computing expenses, as Navitaire’s platform is hosted externally) and 2015
acquisitions, as well as (ii) certain non-recurring effects (such as personnel-related payments or bad
debt provisions).

Excluding non-recurring effects and the impact from acquisitions, fixed operating expenses grew mid-
single digit, mainly driven by the combination of:

A 4% increase in average FTEs (permanent staff and contractors), due to:

e Higher headcount in R&D dedicated to ongoing investment in portfolio expansion and
product evolution (including the progress achieved in our new businesses), as well as
transversal projects and services (see further details in sections 2.2 and 6.3.2).

e Reinforcement of our corporate, technical and commercial support, following the
successful expansion of our customer base, our geographical reach (such as in Asia and
Pacific and North America) and our product portfolio.

Global salary and variable remuneration reviews.
A decline in the overall capitalisation ratio, impacted by project mix.
A positive foreign exchange impact.

6.1.4 Depreciation and Amortisation

Depreciation and amortisation (including capitalised D&A) increased by 4.2% in the fourth quarter of
2016, or 18.3% in the full year, mostly driven by growth in ordinary depreciation and amortisation.

Ordinary D&A increased by 21.4% in 2016 vs. prior year, highly impacted by the consolidation of
Navitaire. Excluding Navitaire, growth resulted from higher amortisation of intangible assets, as
capitalised development expenses on our balance sheet started being amortised in parallel with the
associated project or contract revenue recognition. Depreciation expense related to hardware and
software acquired for our data processing centre in Erding also contributed, to a lesser extent, to the
overall increase.

In compliance with IFRS, impairment tests are carried out every year. During 2016 we reported €27.0
million of impairment losses in relation to (i) the write off of the “Newmarket International”
trademark (replaced by the global Amadeus brand) amounting to €8.6 million and (ii) solutions that
we estimated would not deliver their expected economic benefits.

6.1.5 EBITDA and Operating income

EBITDA increased by 14.7% in the fourth quarter, delivering full year growth of 16.0%. This was
supported by the positive underlying performance of Distribution and IT Solutions as well as by the
contribution from our latest acquisitions (mainly Navitaire) and certain foreign exchange effects
impacting positively the evolution of our cost base (see section 4.1 for details on the exposure of our
operating results to foreign exchange fluctuations).

Operating Income in the fourth quarter of 2016 grew by 21.6%, or 15.1% to €1,212.3 million in the
full year period, as a result of EBITDA growth offset by higher D&A charges.

Net financial expense (15.7) (7.3) 115.2% (71.6) (50.9) 40.6%

Net financial expense increased 40.6% in 2016 vs. prior year, driven by lower exchange gains, as well
as an increase in Other financial expenses (impacted by interest expense associated with tax
provisions).

In turn, interest expense declined by 8.2% in the year vs. 2015, as a consequence of a reduction in the
average cost of debt, particularly in the second half of the year, due to the refinancing of the €750
million notes in July 2016.

6.1.7 Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to €322.9 million in 2016. The income tax rate for the year was 28.2%, lower
than the 32.0% rate reported in 2015. The reduction in income tax rate was mainly driven by (i) a
lower corporate tax rate in Spain, (ii) a deferred tax liability adjustment to reflect government changes
to the corporate tax rate in France from 2020 onwards, as well as, (iii) tax deductions related to
recurring and non-recurring transactions in 2016.

On December 11, 2014 the Board of Directors agreed to undertake a share buy-back programme. The
programme was completed on May 12, 2015 as the maximum planned investment of €320 million
was reached. A total of 8,759,444 own shares were acquired, representing 1.957% of share capital.
The share capital reduction through the amortisation of the repurchased shares was approved by the
General Shareholders Meeting on June 25, 2015 and was registered in the Commercial Registry of
Madrid on August 4, 2015. In 2015, both the weighted average issued and treasury shares were
impacted by this share capital reduction.

On March 11, 2016 the Board of Directors of Amadeus IT Holding, S.A. and that of Amadeus IT Group,
S.A. approved a plan in relation to the merger of both companies (being Amadeus IT Holding, S.A. the
surviving entity), subject to the approval by their respective General Shareholders’ Meetings, which
took place on June 24 and 23, 2016. Following registration of the merger public deed with the
Commercial Registry of Madrid on August 2, 2016 and the fulfilment of legal formalities, Amadeus IT
Group, S.A. was legally dissolved and Amadeus IT Holding, S.A. adopted the name of Amadeus IT
Group, S.A. As of December 31, 2016, 312,519 shares were delivered in exchange of the Amadeus IT
Group, S.A. shares.

The main changes affecting our debt structure during 2016 were:

The drawing on January 25, 2016 of the €500 million bank loan facility agreed in July 2015, to
partially finance the acquisition of Navitaire. This facility was cancelled and replaced on October 6,
2016 by a four-year bond amounting to €500 million under our Euro Medium Term Note
Programme, with maturity in 2020 and a coupon of 0.125%.

A new €500 million Single Currency Revolving Loan Facility, with a five-year term, to be used for
working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, which was executed on April 26,

Reconciliation with net financial debt as per our financial statements

Under the covenant terms, Covenant Financial Debt (i) does not include the accrued interest payable
(€2.5 million at December 31, 2016) which is treated as debt in our financial statements, (ii) is
calculated based on its nominal value, while in our financial statements our financial debt is measured
at amortised cost, i.e., after deducting the deferred financing fees (that mainly correspond to fees
paid upfront in connection with the set-up of new credit agreements and amount to €12.6 million at
December 31, 2016), and (iii) does not include an adjustment for the difference between the nominal
value of the loan granted by the EIB at below-market interest rate and its fair value (€5.2 million at
December 31, 2016).

6.3.1 Change in working capital

Amadeus typically works on negative working capital (i.e. cash inflows), driven by the fact that
Amadeus collects payments from most airlines (more than 80% of our group collections) through IATA
and ACH, with an average collection period of just over one month, whilst payments to providers and
suppliers are made on average over a significantly longer period.

In 2016, the cash inflow from working capital increased by €10.9 million mainly due to the positive
contribution of Navitaire’s working capital.

6.3.2 Capital expenditure, R&D investment
Capital expenditure

The table below details the capital expenditure in the period, both in property, plant and equipment
(“PP&E”) and intangible assets. Based on the nature of our investments in PP&E, the figures may
show variations on a quarterly basis, depending on the timing of certain investments. The same
applies to our investments in contractual relationships where payments to travel agencies may take
place in different periods, based on the timing of the negotiations. In turn, our capitalised R&D
investment may fluctuate depending on the level of capitalisation ratio, which is impacted by the
intensity of the development activity, the mix of projects undertaken and the different stages of the
various projects.

Capex increased by 5.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by 8.2% in the full year period vs. 2015. As
a percentage of revenue, capex declined 0.8 p.p. in 2016, to 13.3%.

The growth in capex in 2016 was driven by a €46.2 million increase in intangible assets, due to (i)
higher software capitalisations related to growing R&D investment, (ii) higher signing bonuses paid
and (iii) an increase in purchases of licenses (related for example to internal technological projects
linked to system security). In turn, capex in PP&E was almost flat vs. prior year as additional hardware
and software purchases (mostly aiming to enhance our data centre’s agility and flexibility) were offset
by less equipment required than in 2015, when new buildings in Nice (France) and Bad Homburg
(Germany) were equipped.

It is important to note that a large part of our investments do not have any revenue associated at this
stage (particularly in the case of new diversification initiatives), or are investments for projects that
will produce revenue during the life of the contracts, on average 10 to 15 years in Airline IT and 3 to5
in Distribution, thereby affecting the capex as a percentage of revenue ratio in the short term. It is
also important to note that a large part of our investments related to the migration of our clients is
paid by the customer, although not recognised as revenue but deferred in the balance sheet. It is
therefore capex which does not have a negative cash impact and where revenue does not get
recognised as such, making the ratio of capex to revenue less relevant.

R&D investment

As a leading and differentiated technology provider for the travel industry, Amadeus undertakes
significant R&D activities, which are key drivers for growth.

R&D investment (including both capitalised and non-capitalised expense) grew by 7.8% in the fourth
quarter of 2016 vs. prior year, and by 10.2% to €706.5 million in the full year period. As a percentage
of revenue, R&D investment amounted to 15.8% in 2016, 0.6 p.p. lower than in 2015.

R&D investment was highly impacted by our latest acquisitions, mainly Navitaire. Excluding this
impact, the underlying growth in R&D was mainly driven by:

Higher efforts to (i) enhance and expand our product portfolio (including merchandising, shopping
and personalisation solutions), (ii) implement the solutions associated with our upselling activity -
Altéa Departure Control Systems, e-commerce and standalone solutions, as well as (iii) services
(such as bespoke developments or e-commerce related services). This increase was partly offset
by lower resources required to implement new carriers to our core Altéa platform.

Growing investment to develop a new-generation Guest Reservation System for the hospitality
industry together with InterContinental Hotels Group, as well as higher resources dedicated to
our new businesses such as Airport IT, Payments or Travel Intelligence.

Increased resources devoted to shifting the company’s platform towards open systems and cloud-
based architecture through next-generation technologies and optimising system performance,
enhancing availability and security levels.

It should be noted that a significant part of our research and development costs are linked to
activities which are subject to capitalisation. The intensity of the development activity and the
different stages in the ongoing projects have an effect on the capitalisation ratio in any given quarter,
therefore impacting the level of operating expenses that are capitalised on our balance sheet.

6.3.3 Taxes paid

Taxes paid in the fourth quarter of 2016 amounted to €151.1 million, €4.1 million lower than in the
same period in 2015. For the full year 2016, tax payments amounted to €300.8 million, €25.1 million
higher than €275.7 million paid in 2015. The increase in taxes paid in the year, which benefitted from
a reduction in the effective tax rate vs. prior year, was mostly driven by (i) higher profit before taxes,
(ii) a higher proportion of corporate taxes prepaid during the year, due to regulatory changes and (iii)
corporate taxes paid by Navitaire.

6.3.4 Interest and financial fees paid

Interest payments under our debt arrangements amounted to €86.5 million in 2016, €23.2 million
higher than in 2015. The net increase was a combination of (i) a higher average gross debt, (ii) a non-
recurring fee from the cancellation of an interest rate swap and (iii) a lower average cost of debt
following the bond refinancing in July 2016.

6.3.5 Free cash flow

Free cash flow increased substantially by €46.5 million or 60.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full-
year growth was 23.1%, amounting to €811.4 million of free cash flow in 2016. This increase was the
result of an increase in the EBITDA and a higher cash inflow from working capital, partly offset by
growth in capex, taxes paid and interest and financial fees paid in the period.

6.3.6 Equity investments

Equity investments amounted to €761.9 million in 2016. This cash outflow mainly relates to the
acquisition of Navitaire. Equity investments in 2015 (€116.9 million) mostly correspond to the
acquisitions of AirlT, Itesso, Hotel SystemPro and Pyton.

6.3.7 Cash to shareholders

In 2016, the cash outflow to shareholders, amounting to €362.5 million, corresponds to (i) a payment
of €338.5 million related to the ordinary dividend of €0.775 per share (gross) on the 2015 profit, and
(ii) €24.0 million related to the acquisition of treasury shares in the year, part of which were acquired
to cover the exchange ratio related to the merger of Amadeus IT Holding, S.A. and Amadeus IT Group,
S.A. (see section 6.1.9).

8 Other additional information
8.1 Expected Business Evolution

8.1.1 Macroeconomic backdrop and Amadeus business model

Amadeus is a leading technology provider to the travel industry. We connect the travel ecosystem -
travel providers, travel sellers and travellers- at every stage of the journey. Our technology allows
travel players to manage their operations with greater efficiency and serve their customers better.
We operate stable and highly resilient transaction-based business models linked to global travel
volumes (mainly bookings made by travel agencies connected to the Amadeus system, or passengers
boarded by airlines using our IT solutions). Our businesses and operations are therefore largely
dependent on the worldwide travel and tourism industry, which is sensitive to general economic
conditions and trends.

The IMF confirmed in its World Economic Outlook Update in January 2017 that global economic
growth should pick up pace in 2017, rising to 3.4% from a rate of 3.1% in 2016.

Advanced economies are projected to grow 1.9% in 2017, representing a 0.3 p.p. lift vs. 2016
mainly attributable to the United States (2.3% in 2017, vs. 1.6% in 2016) which should benefit
from fiscal stimulus, though the policy stance of the incoming administration is still uncertain. The
Euro Area, the United Kingdom and Japan should grow 1.6%, 1.5% and 0.8% respectively.

Emerging markets and developing economies are also expected to accelerate growth, from 4.1%
in 2016 to 4.5% in 2017, reflecting normalization in countries which suffered from economic
strains (e.g. Russia, Brazil). Projected growth in China stands at 6.5% for 2017.

This global economic uplift, combined with an expected increase in oil prices leads IATA to forecast a
5.1%° air traffic increase in 2017 (vs. 5.9% in 2016) as the demand stimulus from lower oil prices and
airfares starts to reverse. Middle East and Asia Pacific should remain once again the fastest growing
regions (9.0% and 7.0% respectively). Air traffic should grow solidly in Africa (4.5%) and slightly
rebound to 4.0% in Europe and Latin America, as terrorist attacks and economic difficulties strained
both regions in the past year. Finally, the current forecast for North America, though tainted by
uncertainty, is a 2.5% increase.

8.1.2 Amadeus strategic priorities and expected business evolution in 2017

Amadeus has grown successfully by taking its business far beyond its initial origins as a Distribution
system for airlines. We are now a critical technology partner for players right across the travel
industry and keep widening the scope of the solutions we provide. In the past, our growth mainly
came from expanding our global presence in Distribution and simultaneously building a solid Airline IT
Solutions business. In the coming years, growth will come from new ways of enhancing these two
businesses with solutions such as digital advertising, Corporate travel IT, merchandising and
personalisation tools. This will be accompanied by growth from our new businesses, such as Airports
or Hospitality as well as the synergies between the different verticals.

(millions of euros)

Amadeus sees the Travel and Technology industries as a space of growth, complexity and connectivity
with the need to better service the traveller in a far more personalised manner. Our uniquely
collaborative and inclusive development model is ideally suited to capture these opportunities. Many
of our existing solutions — and all of our developing ones — are designed precisely to deliver this goal,
of a more connected and personalised travel experience.

Specifically for 2017, we foresee healthy growth in Distribution driven by air traffic growth and an
enhancement of our competitive position. In IT Solutions, we expect robust revenue growth, mainly
as a result of organic growth, new implementations and upselling, as well as continued expansion in
new business areas. We will also benefit partially from the full year impact of the Navitaire
acquisition, consolidated in Amadeus’ books since January 26, 2016. Finally, two important milestones
will be achieved during 2017. We will implement our first large US carrier customer, Southwest
Airlines (the domestic passengers business), to our Altéa platform. We will also start the progressive
roll-out of InterContinental Hotels Group to our new-generation Guest Reservation System platform.

Investing in technology is a key pillar to our success. In 2017, Amadeus will continue to invest in R&D
to support long term growth through new customer implementations, product evolution and
portfolio expansion including non-air IT diversification, as well as internal technological projects.

Amadeus has a proven track record of operating a solid and resilient business model that generates
strong free cash flow, allowing for continued and sustained investment in R&D and innovation as well
as shareholder remuneration, while maintaining a flexible financial capital structure. Ordinary
dividends paid have grown consistently every year since our IPO, at an average annual rate of 20%.
We have complemented this with share repurchases in the past. We aim to continue to support this
growth in the coming years based on our healthy cash generation profile and sound balance sheet.

In particular for the dividend from the profit of the year 2016, the Amadeus Board of Directors on
December 15, 2016 (i) proposed a 50% pay-out target ratio and (ii) approved the distribution of an
interim dividend of €0.40 per share (gross), paid on February 1, 2017. In June 2017, the Board of
directors will submit to the General Shareholders Meeting for approval a final gross dividend of €0.94
per share, representing a 21.3% increase vs. previous year.

8.2 Research and Development Activities

Research and development (R&D) is core to the company’s strategy and key to a sustainable
competitive advantage. In addition, R&D activities help increase efficiency and improve the Amadeus
System functionality, as well as to reduce maintenance and operating costs.

The Group is continuously investing in its systems, including the development of new products an
functionalities, as well as the evolution of the existing platform, based on the latest state-of-the-art
technology available. The group has 16 development centres, including 3 regional centres and the
central development sites in Nice and Bangalore.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, Amadeus expensed €291.9 million for R&D activities an
capitalized €433.9 million (before deducting any incentives), which compares to €243.6 million an
€417.2 million, respectively, in 2015.

Our R&D investment enables us to offer some of the most advanced, integrated and powerfu
business tools available in the market, in order to deliver a best-in-class service to airlines and trave
agencies. Indeed, Amadeus offers enhanced functionalities, such as advanced search and booking
engines, both for travel agencies and travel providers. In addition, our product offering addresses the

Page 44

s IT Group, S.A. and Subsidiaries a M a D E u S

Report for the year ended December 3

(millions of euros)

Passenger Service Systems for airlines, enabling processes such as central reservation, inventory
management, departure control and e-commerce, as well as providing direct distribution
technologies. We are also expanding our airline IT Solutions offering and we are seeking to grow our
market share within the non-airline IT Solutions markets, including the hotel, rail and airport IT
markets.

83 Environmental matters

Amadeus’ operations involve relatively low environmental risks and impacts compared with other
industries. Nonetheless, with a workforce exceeding 14,000 people, commercial presence in more
than 190 countries and operating in a high-energy intensity industry, we acknowledge our
responsibility to minimize the company’s environmental impact and to make our contribution to the
sustainability of the travel industry.

Our environmental strategy is built upon three pillars:

8.3.1 Minimising the environmental impact of Amadeus’ operations

Our environmental strategy addresses the impact of our operations and the concerns of stakeholders
in the travel industry, including customers, employees, partners, regulatory bodies and the society in
general.

We believe our foremost responsibility is to address the environmental impact of our operations.
Fortunately, we often find common economic and environmental interests that facilitate action in
reducing resource consumption. Amadeus Environmental Management System (EMS) is the principal
tool we use in Amadeus to address our environmental impact. The Amadeus EMS includes a
systematic approach by which we:

Measure resource consumption

Identify best practices

Implement actions for improvement and
Follow up results

The items covered by the EMS include energy use, paper consumption, water use, waste generated
and greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the EMS scope includes the top 11 Amadeus sites
by number of employees, which together represent more than 75% of the total workforce and an
estimated 90% of the total resource consumption. Importantly, the Amadeus data centre in Erding,
Germany, is included in the EMS.

The sites that are not included in the EMS are also encouraged to follow the best practices identified
in the EMS. In addition, some sites promote their own local environmental initiatives, which range
from activities as diverse as car-pooling for commuting, recycling campaigns, reducing paper used in
office through the use of specific software that helps to control and minimise paper consumption, etc.

8.3.2 Helping our customers improve their environmental performance

A principal component of Amadeus’ value proposition is based on increasing operational efficiencies
for our customers through our IT solutions. Often, the increased efficiencies mean more productivity,
reduced costs, better use of infrastructure and environmental benefits.

Page 45


--- Page 43 ---

aMaDEUS

(millions of euros)

In the following paragraphs we describe four examples of Amadeus solutions that contribute to
improving the environmental performance of our customers.

Amadeus Altéa Departure Control Flight Management

Thanks to the use of optimization tools, Amadeus Altéa Departure Control System (DCS) Flight
Management (FM) helps customers to save a significant amount of fuel and greenhouse gas
emissions, compared with less sophisticated technologies currently in the market.

In order to quantify the savings described above, Amadeus and Finnair worked together to analyse a
sample of more than 40,000 flights from Finnair, of which approximately half were using Amadeus
Altéa and the other half the previous departure control system used by Finnair. The analysis proved a
higher precision from Altéa DCS FM when estimating the zero fuel weight of the aircraft (EZFW). This
increased precision translates into improvements in the estimation of the fuel needed for each flight,
resulting in significant savings in costs, fuel and emissions.

Amadeus Airport Sequence Manager

Amadeus Airport Sequence Manager helps airports to optimise the flight departure process. The
solution relies on sophisticated sequencing algorithms to calculate the Target Start-Up Approval Time
(TSAT) for each departing flight. This allows the aircraft to leave the stand at the last possible
moment, reducing fuel burn, economic costs and environmental impact, enabling better allocation of
resources. Runway capacity can therefore be optimised at times of congestion, or de-icing processes
taken into account during winter season. As a collaborative tool, Amadeus Airport Sequence Manager
creates a shared situational awareness among all airport partners.

Amadeus launched Airport Sequence Manager in collaboration with Munich Airport — one of the
busiest European airports, with nearly 400,000 aircraft movements per year.

Amadeus Airport Common Use Service (ACUS)

In 2014, Amadeus’ cloud-based Airport Common Use Service (ACUS) was launched. With ACUS,
airports are able to transfer hosting and development responsibilities to Amadeus. Our full, thin client
solution and application virtualisation approach reduce the requirement for costly on-site hardware
equipment, servers and local data centres, as well as IT maintenance. This generates substantial
operational savings for the airport and reduces the overall environmental footprint. Energy
consumption is substantially lower compared to traditional common use solutions.

Amadeus Schedule Recovery

Amadeus Schedule Recovery was launched in 2015. Amadeus Schedule Recovery minimises
disruptions to airline operations caused by external events such as bad weather or air traffic
congestion. The solution, among other features, helps to accommodate to the new situation,
minimising operational costs and environmental impact.

8.3.3 Cooperation with industry stakeholders in sustainability projects in our sector

The environmental sustainability of the travel industry is a common objective for all industry
stakeholders. At Amadeus, we offer our data management capability, technology, expertise and
network to make our contribution towards industry sustainability.

We include below some examples of our participation with other stakeholders in the industry in
relation to environmental sustainability objectives.

Industry standards for carbon calculation per passenger in aviation

The calculation of emissions per passenger in aviation is complicated for various reasons and
therefore, different calculation methodologies offer considerably different emissions estimations for
the same itinerary. It is important that a standard calculation methodology complies with
requirements related to commercial neutrality, global reach and the legitimacy to represent the
industry.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and Amadeus reached an agreement by which
Amadeus uses ICAO’s carbon calculator to display in our distribution platforms the CO2 emissions
estimations per passenger; and by doing this we promote the use of ICAO’s carbon calculator and
help to raise environmental awareness in the sector. The agreement was initially signed in 2009 and
renewed in 2015.

Participation in common projects with industry stakeholders

It’s fundamental that industry stakeholders work together and agree on strategies and responsibilities
towards sustainability. From Amadeus we participate in various forums and specific projects with
trade associations like the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) or United Nations World Tourism
Organisation (UNWTO),.

In 2016, we have produced, in cooperation with Griffith University (Brisbane, Australia) a white paper
on carbon reporting in the travel industry. This research document intends to gain knowledge
regarding current status of various carbon reporting initiatives in the travel industry and promote the
awareness and reduction of carbon emissions in the industry. In addition, Amadeus participated in the
22nd United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties
(COP) in Marrakech in a panel in which the sustainability of the travel and tourism industry was
discussed and where Amadeus — Griffith’s White paper on carbon reporting was officially launched.

Regarding our sustainability efforts, it’s important for us to receive feedback from external
sustainability indices, in order to understand how we perform as compared to other companies, to
identify areas of focus for the future and to improve the quality and transparency of our non-financial
reporting. Since 2012 Amadeus has remained for five consecutive years among top sustainability
scorers and therefore, included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). Amadeus’ scores reached
the maximum possible level (100) in Environmental Policy/Management System and in Environmental
Reporting. Additionally, Amadeus was recognised as a world leader for corporate action on climate
change, with a position on CDP’s (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) 2016 Climate A List. Moreover,
Amadeus has been included for the third consecutive year in the FTSE4Good sustainability index and
for the first time, Amadeus has been recognised among the 100 most sustainable companies in the
world, according to Corporate Knights.

Finally, the Amadeus’ risk and opportunity analysis regarding climate change identifies physical,
regulatory and reputational risks related to the impact of climate change in our operations, although
the probability and impact of these risks remain relatively low. On the other hand, the opportunities
for Amadeus business related to climate change are linked to the possibility of launching new
products and services that help customers to address climate change impacts, as well as to improve
our competitive positioning.

85 Financial Risks

@

The Group has exposure, as a result of the normal course of its business activities, to foreign
exchange, interest rate, own shares price evolution, credit and liquidity risk. The goal of the Group is
to identify measure and minimize these risks using the most effective and efficient methods to
eliminate, reduce, or transfer such exposures. With the purpose of managing these risks, in some
occasions, the Group enters into hedging activities with derivatives and non-derivative instruments.

8.5.1 Foreign exchange rate risk

The reporting currency in the Group’s consolidated annual accounts is the Euro (EUR). As a result o'
the multinational orientation of its business, the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risks
derived from the fluctuations of many currencies. The target of the Group’s foreign exchange hedging
strategy is to reduce the volatility of the Euro value of the consolidated foreign currency denominate
cash flows. The instruments used to achieve this goal depend on the denomination currency of the
operating cash flow to be hedged:

— The strategy for US Dollar (USD) exposures is based on the use of natural hedges and o'
derivatives. This strategy aims at reducing the exposure created by the USD denominate
operating cash inflows of the Group with the USD payments of principals of the USD denominate:
debt and with derivatives, although as of December 31, 2016, there is no USD denominated debt.

— Aside from the USD, the foreign currency exposures are expenditures denominated in a variety o
foreign currencies. The most significant of these exposures are denominated in Sterling Pounds
(GBP), Indian Rupees (INR), Australian Dollars (AUD) and Swedish Kronas (SEK). For these
exposures, a natural hedge strategy is not possible. In order to hedge a significant portion of the

Page 48


--- Page 46 ---

Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and Subsidiaries a M a D E u S

Directors’ Report for the year ended December 31, 2016

(millions of euros)

aforementioned short exposures (net expenditures) the Group can engage into derivative
contracts with banks: basically currency forwards, currency options and combinations of currency
options.

Provided that the objective in relation with the foreign exchange rate risk is to reduce the volatility of
the EUR value of the foreign currency denominated cash flows, the total exposure of the Group to
changes in the foreign exchange rates is measured in terms of Cash-flow at Risk (CFaR). This risk
measure provides an estimate of the potential EUR loss of the foreign currency denominated cash
flows from the moment the estimation is calculated to the moment the cash flow is expected to take
place. These estimates are made using a 95% confidence level.

The CFaR methodology is similar in many respects to the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology. However,
whereas VaR is generally centred in the changes in the value of a portfolio of exposures in a given
future interval of time, CFaR is focused on the changes in the value of the cash-flows of that portfolio
from the calculation date to the moment in which these cash-flows effectively take place. CFaR is a
more adequate measure of the risk of the Group given that the goal of our risk management strategy
with relation to foreign exchange risk is reducing the volatility of the EUR value of the foreign
currency denominated cash-flows. An additional reason for focusing on cash-flows is that, eventually,
the cash-flows of a company result in its level of liquidity which in the case of a non-financial
corporation it is generally a scarce and valuable element.

The main limitations of the CFaR methodology are very similar to the ones of the VaR methodology:

— Firstly, its results are based on several of hypotheses on the future volatilities of the exchange
rates and the future correlation among them which may correspond with the real evolution of the

exchange rates or not’.

— Additionally, the foreign exchange exposure estimates used as inputs to the model may deviate
with respect to the exposures which will finally take place in the future’.

— Finally, it is important to mention that given a level of CFaR calculated with a 95% confidence
level, the losses which could take place in the remaining 5% of the cases may be significantly
greater than the level of risk as measured with the CFaR methodology for a 95% confidence level.

The CFaR of the foreign exchange exposures of the Group calculated with a 95% confidence level is
set forth in the table below:

31/12/2016 31/12/2015

2017CFaR + 2018CFaR 2019CFaR 2016CFaR 2017CFaR 2018 CFaR

(24.1) (62.5) (86.4) (20.4) (49.1) (75.9)

° The volatilities implicit in the market prices of currency options and the historic correlations among the main currencies in which Amadeus has exposures are

used as inputs to the model

* In order to calculate the foreign currency exposures of the Group we take into account the estimated cash flows in each currency according to the last

available forecast and the foreign currency hedges contracted as of the CFaR calculation date.

There are two main reasons for the increase in the CFaR levels of the Group for the next three years
with respect to the CFaR levels outstanding at the end of 2015. On one side, a greater US Dollar
exposure as a consequence of the growth of Amadeus business in the United States. Additionally, the
hedges in US Dollars (USD) have been kept at reduced levels for the next three years.

As it can be observed in the table above, the level of risk measured in CFaR terms tends to increase
for the periods which are further away. The reasons for this are: (1) the further away the future cash-
flows are, more adverse the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations can be potentially; (2) the level of
hedging is smaller for the later periods; (3) in the later periods the size of the foreign exchange
exposures tends to be greater.

8.5.2 Interest rate risk

The objective of the Group in terms of interest rate risk management is reducing the volatility of the
net interest flows payable by the Group. In line with this goal as of December 2016 approximately
76% (92% as of December 2015) of the debt contracted by the Group was fixed rate debt. No interest
rate hedges were hedging this debt as of December 2016 (as of December 2015 there was no interest
rate hedges hedging floating rate debt either).

As of December 2016 the only outstanding interest rate derivatives were hedging future debt that it is
expected to be contracted during 2017 as part of new financing activity of the Company during that
year.

Although the interest rate hedge mentioned above fixes the amount of interests to be paid by
Amadeus in future years, its fair value is sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates. In the table
below you can see an estimation of the Group’s sensitivity to a 0.1% (10 bps) parallel shift of the

interest rate curve:
31/12/2016 31/12/2015
+10 bps -10 bps +10 bps -10 bps

EUR denominated debt 5.7 (5.8) 5.3 (5.4)

EUR accounting hedges 25 (2.5) 15 (1.6)

Total 8.2 (8.3) 6.8 (7.0)

In 2016 there has been an increase in the sensitivity of the EUR denominated debt to the movements
of the interest rate curve with respect to the previous year. This increase is due to the issuance of a
new 4 year Eurobond in the fourth quarter of 2016. Although the future flows of the fixed rate debt
instruments are not sensitive to the changes in the level of interest rates, the fair value of the
instruments are sensitive to these changes.

According to the table above a 10 bps drop in the level of interest rates would cause a loss in the fair
value of the debt (an increase of the liability) and the derivatives in the Amadeus hedging portfolio
amounting to €8.3 million at December 31, 2016, and €7.0 million at December 31, 2015 respectively.
However, given that the changes in the fair value of the derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting
are recognized directly in equity and the debt is measured at amortized cost, the impact of a 10 bps
drop in the level of interest rates would imply no loss recognized in the profit for the year at

(millions of euros)

December 31, 2016 and 2015, since the derivative in the interest rate portfolio of the Group is to be
accounted as a cash-flow hedge.

In cash flow terms, in the case of a parallel drop (or rise) in the level of interest rates the lower (or
higher) interests payable for the debt which is hedged, would be compensated by a similar amount of
higher (or lower) debt interests to be paid during the life of the hedges (cash flow hedge concept).

8.5.3 Own shares price evolution risk

As of December 31, 2016, the Group has three different remuneration schemes outstanding which
are settled with Amadeus shares; the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
and the Share Match Plan.

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature their beneficiaries will receive a number of
Company’s shares which for the outstanding plans will be (depending on the evolution of certain
performance conditions) between a maximum of 1,817,000 shares and a minimum of 267,000 shares,
approximately. It is Amadeus intention to make use of its 1,521,273 treasury shares to settle these
plans at their maturity.

8.5.4 Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial asset will cause a loss for the Group by failing to
discharge an obligation.

Amadeus’ cash and cash equivalents are deposited in major banks on the basis of diversification and
the credit risk of the available investment alternatives.

The credit risk of Amadeus’ customer accounts receivable is mitigated by the fact that the majority
are settled through the clearing houses operated by the International Air Transport Association
(“IATA”) and Airlines Clearing House, Inc. (“ACH”). These systems guarantee that the cash inflows
from our customers will be settled at a certain fixed date, and mitigate the credit risk partially by the
fact that the members of the clearing house are required to make deposits that would be used in the
event of default. Moreover, our customer base is large and unrelated which results in a low
concentration of our credit risk.

8.5.5 Liquidity risk

The Corporate Treasury is responsible for providing the cash needed by all the companies of the
Group. In order to perform this task more efficiently, the Group concentrates the excess liquidity of
the subsidiaries and channels it to the companies with cash needs.

This allocation of the cash position among the companies of the Group is mainly made through:

A cash pooling agreement with most of the subsidiaries located in the Euro area.
Through bilateral Treasury Optimization agreements between Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and its
subsidiaries.

Corporate Treasury monitors the Group’s cash position through rolling forecasts of expected cash
flows. These forecasts are performed by the subsidiaries of the Group and later on consolidated in
order to examine both the liquidity situation and prospects of the Group and its subsidiaries.

The detail of the contractual maturities of the Group’s debt financing as of the end of the financial
year 2016 is described in the note 16 “Current and non-current debt”.

In addition to other smaller treasury lines agreed with several banks, the Group has access to two
Revolving Credit facilities as detailed in note 16. Each of these two facilities has a notional of €500.0
million and can be used to cover working capital needs and general corporate purposes. As of
December 31, 2016, €100.0 million of the outstanding Revolving Credit facilities were used and thus
the unused part of these facilities amounted to €900.0 million.

Finally, in August 2016, the notional of the Multi-Currency European Commercial Paper (ECP)
program was increased from €500.0 million up to €750.0 million. This program can be used for raising
short term financing. As of December 31, 2016 €485.0 million of this program are in use.
