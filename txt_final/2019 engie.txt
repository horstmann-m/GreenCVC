MANAGEMENT REPORT
1 ENGIE 2019 RESULTS

e Client Solutions results benefited from the contribution of acquisitions and the performance of decentralized
energy activities, partly offset by investments in business development capability and some operational
restructuring actions;

e Networks was impacted by several negative effects outside France (mainly one-offs and temperature) as well as
several adverse factors in France that were expected and are mostly temporary (mainly tariff smoothing in
transmission). Networks also benefited from the first year contribution of the TAG gas transmission pipeline in
Brazil, acquired in mid-2019;

e Renewables benefited from higher Brazilian hydro prices and increasing commissioning of renewable capacity
(3.0 GW in 2019). The target of 9 GW to be commissioned from 2019 to 2021 is now fully secured;

e Supply activities continued to be impacted by a difficult market context, mainly from margin contractions in French
retail, by positive 2018 one-offs in Benelux and adverse temperature effects in Australia and France;

e | Thermal was impacted by the disposal of Glow partly offset by Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) performance
and positive market price conditions in Chile as well as the reinstatement of the capacity remuneration mechanism
in the United Kingdom.

ENGIE continued to pursue its strategic focus on the energy transition in 2019.

In Client Solutions, ENGIE and its partners won commercial contracts for the University of lowa (United States),
government buildings in Ottawa (Canada), a “smart region” around Angers (France) and industrial buildings in Singapore.
In addition, ENGIE made several acquisitions including Conti in North America, Otto Industries in Germany and Powerlines
in Austria. ENGIE Impact was created to bring large customers with solutions to build their sustainability roadmap and
accelerate their energy transition.

In Networks, ENGIE announced on June 13, 2019 that the consortium in which it holds a majority stake completed the
acquisition of a 90% shareholding in TAG, the largest gas transmission network owner in Brazil. TAG has a portfolio of
long-term contracts providing an attractive earnings stream and improves diversification of ENGIE’s geographic footprint
in Networks activities. In January 2020, ENGIE also further strengthened its position in Brazil by announcing the acquisition
of a project of a 1,800 km power transmission line. Finally, ENGIE gained visibility on the financial outlook of its French
gas networks activities with the conclusion of the regulatory reviews between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020.

In Renewables, 3.0 GW of renewable capacity was commissioned and the 9 GW commissioning target, over 2019-21, is
now fully secured. The new joint-venture in Mexico with Tokyo Gas and the strategic partnership signed with Edelweiss
Infrastructures Yield in India at the beginning of 2020 demonstrate ENGIE’s ability to deploy the DBSO “) model and attract
partners for the development of its portfolio. In addition, ENGIE, along with financial partners, won a bid to acquire a
1.7 GW hydroelectric portfolio from EDP in Portugal. Finally, in January 2020, ENGIE reached an agreement with EDPR
for the 50/50 joint-venture in offshore wind to create a global offshore wind player.

In Thermal, ENGIE continued to execute its carbon footprint reduction strategy, with coal now approximately 4% of global
power generation capacity, following the disposal of its 69.1% stake in Glow in Thailand and Laos (3.2 GW of generation
capacity, of which 1.0 GW is coal), ending its participation in coal in the Asia-Pacific region, and the disposal of its German
and Dutch coal assets (capacity of 2.3 GW).

In Nuclear, an arrangement on Belgian nuclear provisions was reached reducing uncertainty for all parties regarding the
level of provisions and their funding.

1.1 Analysis of financial results at December 31, 2019

1.1.1. Revenues of €60,1 billion

Revenues were €60.1 billion, up 5.4% on a gross basis and 4.1% on an organic basis.

(1) Develop, Build, Share & Operate.

ENGIE - 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT REPORT
1 ENGIE 2019 RESULTS

Reported revenue growth was driven by scope effects, including various acquisitions in Client Solutions (primarily in the
United States with Conti, France and Latin America with CAM) and in BtoB Supply in the US, partially offset by the disposals
of ENGIE’s stake in Glow in Thailand in March 2019 and of BtoB Supply activities in Germany at the end of 2018. This
growth also includes a slightly positive foreign exchange effect, mainly due to the appreciation of the US dollar, partly offset
by the depreciation of the Argentinian peso and the Brazilian real against the euro.

Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by Supply revenues in North America, France and Europe, growth in Client
Solutions in Europe, energy management services and favorable market conditions for Global Energy Management (GEM)
activities and strong momentum in Latin America (PPA portfolio growth in Chile as well as commissioning of new wind and
solar farms in Brazil). This growth was partially offset by lower revenues from Supply activities in the UK and Australia and
from Thermal activities in Europe.

Clients Solutions revenues were up 11% on a gross basis and 3% on an organic basis, benefiting from a positive effect of
acquisitions and favorable market context for industrial clients in Europe.

1.1.2. EBITDA of €10.4 billion

EBITDA was €0.4 billion, up 6.8% on a gross basis and 8.1% on an organic basis.

These gross and organic variations are overall in line with the current operating income growth, except for the increase in
depreciation mainly due to the commissioning of assets in Latin America and in France, especially in Networks which are
not taken into account at EBITDA level.

In addition, Lean 2021, which contributes to the organic increase at EBITDA and COI levels, exceeded the 2019 targets
and is on track to meet the target set for 2021.

1.1.3. Current operating income (COl) of €5.7 billion

Current operating income amounted to €5.7 billion, up 11.1% on a reported basis and 14.4% on an organic basis.

The reported COI growth includes a positive foreign exchange effect, mainly due to the appreciation of the US dollar,
partly offset by the depreciation of the Argentinian peso and the Brazilian real against the euro This positive effect is partly
offset by an aggregate negative scope effect, including the disposal of the 69.1% stake in Glow in Thailand and Laos,
partly offset by various acquisitions predominantly in Networks (TAG) and in Client Solutions.

Organic COI performance varied across the Group’s business lines:

positive outcome on Argentina court case, restructuring costs and asset write-downs).

e Client Solutions reported a 1% organic COI decrease, impacted by headwinds in specific segments and an
increase in development costs notably on newer growth businesses. These effects were partly offset by an
increased contribution from SUEZ and decentralized energy activities.

e Networks reported a 6% organic COI decrease, mainly due to gas distribution activities with 2018-19 negative
one-off effects recorded outside of France and negative temperature effects in France and in Europe, only partially
offset by a commissioning costs provision reversal and tariff increases in France. Gas transmission activities in
France also suffered from a negative volume effect due to the merger of the North and South gas market zones
and from a negative price effect resulting from tariff smoothing.

ENGIE - 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT REPORT
1 ENGIE 2019 RESULTS

e Renewables reported an 8% organic COI increase, primarily driven by higher prices for hydroelectric power
generation in Brazil and in France and the 3.0 GW commissioning of new capacities since January 1, 2019, notably
in Brazil (0.5 GW), the United States (0.5 GW), Spain (0.4 GW), Mexico (0.3 GW), India (0.3 GW), France (0.3 GW)
and Egypt (0.3 GW). These positive effects were partly offset by lower DBSO margins compared to the high level
of DBSO transactions in 2018 and lower hydroelectric power generation in France.

e Thermal showed a 7% organic COl increase, mainly attributable to the PPA portfolio growth and positive market
price conditions in Chile. In addition, the reinstatement of the capacity remuneration mechanism in the United
Kingdom, as well as and the favorable impact of the gas spreads in Europe were positive. These effects were
partially offset by the expiry of a PPA in Turkey in April 2019. The amount of liquidated damages received was
roughly stable in 2019 versus 2018.

e Nuclear delivered a 70% organic COI! growth, benefiting from higher availability rates in Belgium following 2018
unplanned outages (+2,720bps and +62% volumes produced) and better achieved prices (+2€/MWh).

e Supply CO! reduced by 34% on an organic basis, primarily driven by margin pressures on French gas and
electricity retail contracts, a commissioning costs accrual reversal (related to the coverage of the cost to serve
customers handled by energy suppliers during the French market opening, from 2007 to 2016, fully offset by a
symmetrical provision reversal for Gas distribution in France), 2018 positive one-offs in Benelux and negative
temperature effects in Australia and in France. These effects were partly offset by higher business margins in
France.

e Others business line delivered 42% organic COI growth, mainly reflecting GEM’s good performance coming from
the partial sale of a gas supply contract to Shell and a positive impact from gas contract renegotiations and overall
favorable market conditions, as well as lower Corporate costs.

Organic COI performance varied across segments:

Middle East, Asia & Africa 559 896 -37.6% -9.1%

Others 231 357
TOTAL 5,726 5,154 +11.1% +14.4%

Based on the reportable segments, the organic COI growth was led by the Rest of Europe (mainly driven by the recovery
of Nuclear activities with better availability and higher prices, the reinstatement of the capacity remuneration mechanism
in the United Kingdom, the favorable impact of gas spreads in Europe; partly offset by 2018 positive one-offs including
Liquidated Damages received, difficulties in Benelux and the UK in Supply activities and in Client Solutions with some
loss-making contracts), by the Others segment (mainly due to GEM’s good performance in market activities and an
increased contribution from SUEZ) and by Latin America (notably due to the favorable impact of LDs received in Thermal
activities in 2019, higher prices for hydroelectric power generation and commissioning of new wind and solar assets in
Brazil and in Mexico as well as PPA portfolio growth in Chile).

These positive impacts were partly offset by an organic COI decrease in Middle East, Africa & Asia (mainly driven by
headwinds in Supply in Australia and Africa, in Networks in Turkey, partly offset by positive contribution of Thermal
generation and Renewables activities), in France (for France excluding Infrastructures, mainly due to lower DBSO margins
compared to the 2018 high level, margin pressure in Supply activities and lower hydroelectric power generation partly
offset by higher hydro prices, increased wind and solar contributions and improved profitability in Client Solutions activities;
for France Infrastructures, mainly due to the lower contribution of transmission and distribution activities) and in
USA & Canada (mainly driven by Client Solutions, notably due to negative one-offs booked in 2019, lower contribution
from Thermal activities due to lower capacity prices; partly offset by higher DBSO margins and commissioned asset
contributions in Renewable activities).

MANAGEMENT REPORT
1 ENGIE 2019 RESULTS

1.1.4. Net recurring income relating to continued operations, Group share of €2.7 billion
and Net income Group share of €1.0 billion

Net recurring income relating to continued operations, Group share amounted to €2.7 billion compared with
€2.5 billion in 2018. This increase was mainly driven by the continued improvement in the current operating income partly
offset by higher taxes, mainly due to the 2018 positive effect from the recognition of deferred tax assets and slightly higher
recurring financial costs, reflecting the modification in the business mix (higher debt in Brazil).

Net income Group share amounted to €1.0 billion in 2019, stable year-on-year, as a result of the increase in Net recurring
income and gains on disposals, mainly resulting from the Glow transaction, which offset the impact of the triennial review
of nuclear provisions in Belgium and minor negative mark-to-market variation.

1.1.5. Financial net debt of €25.9 billion

Financial net debt stood at €25.9 billion, up €2.7 billion compared to December 31, 2018. This variation is attributed to
(i) capital expenditures over the period (EUR 10.0 billion ™, including the €1.5 billion expenditures for the TAG transaction
in Brazil), (ii) dividends paid to ENGIE SA shareholders (€1.8 billion) and to non-controlling interests (€0.7 billion) and
(iii) other elements (€0.6 billion) mainly related to foreign exchange rates, new right-of-use assets and mark-to-market
variations. These items were partly offset by (i) cash flow from operations (€7.6 billion) and (ii) the impacts of the portfolio
rotation program (€2.8 billion, mainly related to the Glow disposal).

Cash flow from operations ® amounted to €7.6 billion, down €0.2 billion. The decrease stemmed predominantly from
working capital requirement variations (€1.3 billion negative impact), mainly caused by margin calls on derivatives and
mark-to-market variation of financial derivatives, partly offset by the increase of operating cash flow (€0.9 billion) and lower
tax and interests payments (€0.2 billion).

At the end of December 2019, the financial net debt to EBITDA ratio amounted to 2.5x. Excluding the TAG acquisition
which was not included in the 2019 guidance and which contributed only partially to the 2019 EBITDA, this ratio amounted
to 2.4x, stable compared to the end of 2018 and on the target of less than or equal to 2.5x. The average cost of gross debt
was 2.70%, slightly up compared to the end of 2018, notably due to new borrowings in Brazil.

At the end of December 2019, the economic net debt ® to EBITDA ratio stood at 4.0x. Excluding the TAG acquisition,
this ratio stood at 3.8x, slightly increasing compared to December 2018.

Revenues in the France excluding Infrastructures segment amounted to €15,854 million, up 5.7% on a reported basis and
4.4% on an organic basis. Organic growth can be explained by higher revenues in the BtoC power segment and BtoB
services businesses. Acquisitions in BtoB services also contributed significantly to growth on a reported basis (in particular
Powerlines, Pierre Guerin, Endel SRA and Sodelem).

Gas sales volumes in the BtoC segment decreased by 5.1 TWh compared to 2018, of which 0.7 TWh related to a negative
temperature effect, mainly as a result of the end of regulated gas tariffs. The BtoC power portfolio recorded a significant
increase of 1.6 TWh, whereas volumes produced by power generation and France Networks dropped by 1.8 TWh.

Current operating income was €903 million, down 13.1% on a reported basis and 15.2% on an organic basis. This drop
was mainly due to lower DBSO (Develop, Build, Share & Operate) margins in 2019, and higher operating expenses (OPEX)
in the BtoC segment to support the development of gas and power market offers. 2019 results were also affected by the
impact of lower hydroelectric power generation. These underperformances were partly offset by higher prices for hydro
power, higher wind and solar production, and a good organic performance in BtoB activities thanks to new contracts and
increased profitability.

CURRENT OPERATING INCOME (COI 1,957 2,018 -3.0% -2.8%

Revenues in the France Infrastructures segment amounted to €5,569 million, €119 million above 2018. The increase was
driven by terminalling activities, which benefited from the outsourcing of LNG activities as well as tariff increases in
distribution activities, and by transmission activities, although growth was limited by tariff smoothing and lower subscribed
capacity. These favorable impacts were partly offset by a decrease in storage activities with a reduction in buy/sale
operations in France following the introduction of new regulations in 2018, offset by international activities.

Current operating income for the period was €1,957 million, down 2.8% on an organic basis. In transmission activities,
this decrease was due to negative price effects in France — mainly tariff smoothing — and Germany. To a lesser extent,
storage activities were impacted by customer penalties in France due to a temporarily deteriorated operating performance
as well as to negative price effects in Germany, while terminalling activities were impacted by tariff changes. Growth in
distribution activities partly offset these effects, with tariff hikes more than offsetting mild climate and other changes in
OPEX.

CURRENT OPERATING INCOME (COI 684 46

Revenues in the Rest of Europe segment amounted to €17,270 million, up 2.4% on an organic basis. This growth was
driven by Supply and Client Solutions activities, whereas Thermal revenues decreased.

Supply activities benefited from positive price effects in Belgium, the Netherlands and Romania, partly offset by Supply
activities in the United Kingdom and Germany due to the divestments in the German Retail BtoB portfolio in 2018.

The increase in Client Solutions mainly arose from Belgium’s installation and energy efficiency segments, Central Europe
which benefited from positive scope effects in Germany as a result notably of the acquisition of OTTO (January 2019), and
organic growth in Spain mainly in installation activities.

Current operating income amounted to €684 million. The reported growth of €639 million was mainly driven by Nuclear
activities and a slight increase in Renewables. Client Solutions remained stable compared to last year, while Supply,
Networks and Thermal activities were down.

Nuclear activities benefited from higher availability rates in Belgium (2018 had been impacted by a high number of days of
unplanned outages) and better achieved prices. Renewable activities benefited from good performances in wind onshore
activities in Benelux.

Client Solutions reported a lower contribution from asset-light activities as a result of a significant drop notably in the United
Kingdom and Benelux due to contract renegotiations and legacy loss-making contracts, but achieved a better performance
in asset-based activities mainly in the Generation Europe BU through its cogeneration units as well as in the North, South
and Eastern Europe BU in Italy and Germany.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

The decrease in Thermal activities mainly arose from higher positive one-offs in 2018, lower coal spreads partially offset
by better gas spreads, and capacity market reinstatement in the United Kingdom. Supply activities decreased in Benelux
and the United Kingdom, and Networks activities decreased in Germany.

Revenues in the Latin America segment totaled €5,341 million, up 15.1% on a reported basis and 10.9% organically.
Reported growth comprises the positive effect of a Client Solutions entity acquired at the end of last year (CAM), partially
offset by a negative net foreign exchange effect, with the depreciation of the Brazilian real (-2.4%) and Argentinian peso
(-36.0%) being partially offset by the appreciation of the US dollar (+5.5%), Mexican peso (+5.3%) and Peruvian sol
(+3.9%). In Chile, business was positively impacted by the ramp-up of new Power Purchase Agreements with distribution
companies. In Brazil, organic growth was mainly driven by the commissioning of wind and solar farms and a new thermal
unit, and the effect of inflation on PPA contracts.

Current operating income totaled €1,694 million, up 24.6% on a reported basis and 20.2% on an organic basis. Reported
growth benefited from the positive impact of the acquisition in June 2019 of a gas transportation entity in Brazil (TAG). The
organic growth was due to the favorable impact of liquidated damages received in Chile and Brazil in 2019, and the positive
organic effects mentioned above for revenues. These impacts were partially offset by a positive one-off recorded in 2018
in Mexico.

CURRENT OPERATING INCOME (COI 159 153 +3.9% -5.5%

Revenues in the USA & Canada segment came in at €4,545 million, up 35.5% on a reported basis. In addition to positive
foreign exchange effects, revenues benefited from scope-in effects relating to recent acquisitions in Client Solutions and
Retail BtoB (Plymouth Rock) in the United States. The 10.1% organic growth was mainly the result of positive price effects
on BtoB power sales in the United States with no effect at current operating income level.

Current operating income totaled €159 million, down 5.5% on an organic basis compared to 2018. The main reasons for
the decrease were a lower operational performance in Client Solutions due to loss-making contracts, set-up costs for
ENGIE Impact and lower capacity prices in Thermal activities. These effects were partly offset by the progressive ramp-
up of Renewables activities in the United States, including the DBSO sell down of a wind project (Live Oak) and
contributions from two wind projects commissioned in 2019.

Revenues for the Middle East, Africa & Asia segment totaled €2,914 million, down 27.4% on a reported basis and 6.7%
organically. The reported decrease was mainly due to the disposal of Glow (Thailand) in March 2019, a weakened
performance in Supply (mainly Simply Energy in Australia), as well as lower revenues in Client Solutions in Africa and
Australia. The decrease was partly offset by acquisitions in the Middle East (Cofely Besix) and Asia (RCS Engineering),
and positive foreign exchange effects.

Electricity sales decreased by 27 TWh to 16.8 TWh, with reduced volumes mostly due to the sale of Glow and Loy Yang B.

Current operating income totaled €559 million, down 37.6% on a reported basis and 9.1% organically. The gross reported
decrease was due to the negative impact of the disposal of Glow and Loy Yang B, partly offset by positive foreign exchange
effects. The organic decrease notably reflects difficulties (i) in Supply in Australia and Africa, (ii) in Networks partly related
to a positive provision reversal in Turkey in 2018, and to a lesser extent (iii) in Services activities. The decrease was partly
offset by the positive contribution of Thermal Generation and the positive impact of Renewables activities, including
liquidated damages for the Willogoleche wind farm in Australia.

Collectivités (E&C) and the contribution of SUEZ (associate).

Revenues for the Others reportable segment amounted to €8,565 million. The 13.2% reported growth compared to 2018
represented €1,000 million, mainly driven by GEM due to a favorable market context and E&C mainly due to an increase
in power volumes and average prices (up €910 million gross for both GEM & E&C).

Current operating loss amounted to €231 million euros, representing a €126 million improvement compared to 2018.
This improvement was mainly due to a strong performance by GEM in market activities, the partial transfer of a gas supply
contract, gas contract renegotiations and the Certinergy acquisition in February 2019, partially offset by a sluggish
performance by storage activities in bearish markets. Current operating income/(loss) also benefited from positive one-offs
at SUEZ and in connection with the Link 2018 employee shareholding plan. These favorable impacts were partly offset by
a decline in margins for Tractebel Engineering.

Income from operating activities amounted to €3,676 million in 2019, representing an increase compared with 2018,
mainly due to (i) gains on asset disposals (principally relating to the disposal of ENGIE’s interest in Glow), (ii) the
improvement in current operating income, (iii) partly offset by the recognition of additional costs related to the triennial
review of nuclear provisions in Belgium.

Income from operating activities was also affected by:

e net impairment losses of €1,770 million in 2019 compared with €1,798 million in 2018, mainly relating to Belgian
nuclear power assets (including €638 million on dismantling assets for nuclear facilities whose operating life may
not be extended, recognized against the provision, as part of the triennial review of nuclear provisions) and thermal
power generation assets in Latin America and the Middle East (see Note 9.1);

e — restructuring costs of €218 million (compared with €162 million in 2018) (see Note 9.2);
e positive scope effects of €1,604 million, mainly relating to the disposal of ENGIE’s interest in Glow;

e — other non-recurring items for a negative €1,240 million, mainly including the €1,166 million net expense related to
additions to provisions for the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle as part of the triennial review of nuclear provisions
in Belgium.

The net financial loss amounted to €1,387 million in 2019, compared with €1,414 million the previous year (see Note 10).

The income tax expense for 2019 amounted to €640 million (versus €702 million in 2018). It includes an income tax
benefit of €471 million arising on non-recurring taxable items (versus €147 million in 2018), mainly comprising
mark-to-market losses recognized by ENGIE SA. The effective tax rate decreased significantly in 2019 (35.8% versus
78.1% in 2018), mainly due to the non-taxation of proceeds from the Glow disposal. Adjusted for these non-recurring items,
the effective recurring tax rate was 28.2%, up on the 2018 rate of 23.7% mainly due to the impact of more positive one-off
effects in 2018 than in 2019.

Net income relating to continued operations attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to €664 million,
compared with €595 million in 2018. The increase was mainly due to lower impairment losses compared to the previous
year on coal assets in Germany, partly offset by the deconsolidation of ENGIE’s interest in Glow as from March 14, 2019
following its disposal.

The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets was €59.0 billion, up €1.2 billion compared
with December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of acquisitions and development capital expenditure during
the period (€7.4 billion positive impact), translation adjustments (€0.1 billion positive impact), partly offset by depreciation
and amortization charges (€4.3 billion negative impact), impairment losses (€1.7 billion negative impact), changes in the
scope of consolidation (€0.8 billion negative impact), the classification of renewable energy assets in Mexico and green
gas production assets in operation in France as “Assets classified as held for sale” (€0.4 billion negative impact), and
disposals (€0.2 billion negative impact).

Goodwill increased by €0.9 billion to €18.7 billion, mainly due to acquisitions made by the following BUs: France BtoB,
France Renewables, Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe, and Latin America, partly offset by the recognition of
impairment losses on the disposal of the coal-fired power plants in Germany and the Netherlands (see Note 4.1.2).

Total equity amounted to €38.0 billion, a decrease of €2.9 billion compared with December 31, 2018. The decrease
stemmed mainly from the payment of the cash dividend (€2.3 billion negative impact, including €1.8 billion of dividends
paid by ENGIE SA to its shareholders and €0.5 billion paid to non-controlling interests), other items of comprehensive
income (€1.8 billion negative impact), and the effect of the deconsolidation of Glow following its disposal (€0.5 billion
negative impact), partly offset by net income for the period (€1.6 billion positive impact).

Provisions increased by €3.6 billion to €25.1 billion compared with December 31, 2018. This increase stemmed mainly
from the impacts of the triennial review of nuclear provisions in Belgium (which added €2.1 billion to the total amount)
(see Note 19), actuarial losses on provisions for post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits (which added
€1.1 billion to the total amount) owing to the fall in discount rates over the period (see Note 20).

At December 31, 2019, assets and liabilities classified under “Assets classified as held for sale” and “Liabilities
directly associated with assets classified as held for sale” comprised renewable energy assets in Mexico and green
gas production assets in operation in France.
