Market

Growth in installations in 2016E-17E will continue to be focused on emerging markets, where
Gamesa has a sound competitive position

The year 2015 experienced a record volume of instal lations: 63,013 MW "’, as a result of peak levels

in China, EE.UU and Germany. These high volumes wer e the result of specific events that are not
expected to occur in the immediate future. In 2015, volume reacted to a growth in onshore
installations in China (30,500 MW '°, +31% y/y) and USA (8,598 MW_ '°, +77% y/y) represented a 70%
of gross annual growth and 60% of total onshore ins tallations. In both markets, projects were
accelerated by the prospect of regulatory changes: a reduction in feed-in fees for wind farms
commissioned after 2016 in China, and uncertainty a s to whether tax incentives for wind power

production would be extended in the US. Germany con nected 2,282 MW of offshore ‘° capacity, i.e.
62% of total offshore capacity installed in 2015, c | ompared to 543 MW in 2014, due to overcoming
grid connection problems, which enabled projects th at had been delayed since 2013 to be
commissioned.
