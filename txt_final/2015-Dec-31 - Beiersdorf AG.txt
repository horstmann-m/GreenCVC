Beiersdorf Annual Report 2015 / Corporate Governance / Remuneration Report

2. REMUNERATION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD

The remuneration of the Supervisory Board (§ 15 of the Articles of Association)
takes into account the responsibilities and scope of tasks of the individual mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board as well as the company’s economic situation.

In addition to being reimbursed for cash expenses, Supervisory Board members
also receive a fixed and a variable dividend-based remuneration component,
which is geared towards sustainable enterprise performance, and attendance
fees for Supervisory Board and committee meetings. The Chairman of the
Supervisory Board receives two-and-a-half times the standard Supervisory
Board remuneration and his two deputies each receive one-and-a-half times
the standard Supervisory Board remuneration. Members of committees - with
the exception of the Nomination Committee and the committee set up in ac-
cordance with § 27 (3) Mitbestimmungsgesetz (German Co-Determination Act,
MitbestG) - receive additional compensation for their work in these commit-
tees. If amember of the Supervisory Board simultaneously holds several offices
for which increased remuneration is granted, he or she shall only receive the
remuneration for the highest-paying office.

19

The fixed remuneration component per Supervisory Board member is €40,000
for each full fiscal year. The variable remuneration is €1,000 for each cent by
which the dividend per share exceeds €0.25. 40% of this will be paid out after
the actions of the Supervisory Board member in question have been approved
by the Annual General Meeting for the fiscal year for which remuneration is
being paid (initial year). The remaining amount will be paid out following the
Annual General Meeting to which the annual financial statements for the third
fiscal year following the initial year are submitted, insofar as the average
dividend for the initial year and the three following fiscal years is not lower than
the dividend for the initial year. Interest in line with current market rates will be
paid on this amount until such time as it is paid out. Furthermore, members of
the Supervisory Board and committees receive an attendance fee of €1,000 for
participating in full at a meeting of the Supervisory Board or committee and
€500 for participating in the majority of a meeting.

Business and Strategy

Beiersdorf is a global leader in the consumer goods industry with a total of over
17,000 employees in more than 150 affiliates. It is divided into two business
segments:

© The Consumer Business Segment, whose strong brands focus on the inter-
national skin and body care markets, is the main business.

© The tesa Business Segment is a pioneering manufacturer of self-adhesive
products and solutions for industry, craft businesses, and consumers.

Consumer Business Segment

Beiersdorf aims to be the No. 1 skin care company in its relevant categories and
markets. The Blue Agenda sets the strategic direction to achieve this goal and
fully leverage the growth potential of our strong brands. It consists of the fol-
lowing strategic focuses:

°

Strengthening our brands - first and foremost NIVEA

Increasing our innovative power

© Expanding our presence in emerging markets and consolidating our market
position in Europe

© The people at Beiersdorf

°


--- Page 4 ---

22

The Core Values describe what Beiersdorf stands for and shape the work of
each one of our employees: Care, Simplicity, Courage, and Trust. During the year
under review, we further substantiated our strategic framework. We defined the
topics that Beiersdorf will focus on in the next few years in order to ensure the
company’s sustainable success: people, brands, innovations, localization,
digitalization, sales, and efficiency.

The performance of our business shows that our strategy is paying off. Beiersdorf
picked up further momentum in the reporting period and continued its profita-
ble growth path. Earnings excluding special factors hit a record level in 2015, as
did the EBIT margin. With strong brands, product innovations, and an increased
presence in emerging markets, the company gained further market share and
built on its strong position.

BRANDS

The strength of our brands, and particularly of NIVEA, plays a decisive part in
our economic success. Beiersdorf’s brands embody trust, quality, and consist-
ency, and precisely meet consumers’ needs. In our core business of skin care, for
example, NIVEA was again voted Europe’s most trusted brand in 2015*. Our dis-
ciplined brand strategy has managed to sustainably expand our brands’
impact. The good performance of NIVEA, Eucerin, and La Prairie over the past
fiscal year clearly underlines this success.

INNOVATIONS.

In order to further increase its innovation capacity, Beiersdorf is pursuing a
long-term strategy that is clearly aimed at sustainable growth. This means
introducing new products with great potential to be future growth drivers, as
well as extending innovation cycles to make optimum use of the growth of our
major innovations. Combining these two aspects is key to Beiersdorf’s success,
as is reflected in the development of innovations in the year under review. The
all-purpose skin creams introduced in 2015 - NIVEA Care and NIVEA MEN Creme
- are the result of the latest skin care research technologies and offer outstand-
ing value for money. With these two entry-level skin care products, we are not
only tapping new consumer groups for our most important core brand, but are
also once again setting new market trends. The figures in 2015 underline the
potential of both creams to drive long-term growth: they achieved double-digit
market share in many markets only a short time after their launch.

Major innovations such as NIVEA Deo Black & White, NIVEA Body In-Shower,
NIVEA Face Cellular Anti-Age, and NIVEA Face Q10 Pearls saw continued growth
and significantly contributed to the success of the business in 2015. This consist-
ently strong performance shows that our products not only deliver outstanding
quality, but unique added value for our consumers, too.

MARKETS

In order to market products successfully, having a precise knowledge of con-
sumers’ specific needs is essential. When it comes to customers’ expectations of
products, there are sometimes major differences from region to region. Being
close to consumers at a local level is crucial in order to incorporate changing
expectations into product development flexibly and quickly. This is the only way
to secure market share in the long term. In the year under review, Beiersdorf
continued its targeted investments in local development and production capac-
ity in order to further improve our presence and impact in important emerging
markets. We were also able to further build on our strong position in the estab-
lished European and North American markets.

India is an important growth market for Beiersdorf. The opening of a production
facility and regional laboratory in Sanand in May 2015 has given us greater prox-
imity to Indian consumers. The facility was completed just one and a half years
after the decision to build it was made. It manufactures various care products in
mini bottles and sachets: the perfect match for Indian consumers’ requirement
for good value products in small packaging units.

PEOPLE

The successes of 2015 are first and foremost the achievement of our committed
employees. We worked together over the reporting period to further simplify
our cost structures and processes, putting the company ona considerably more
efficient foundation. In the coming years, we will focus on further improving
Beiersdorf’s competitiveness and impact.

In order to integrate the culture of feedback and dialog even more closely into
the day-to-day work of every employee, we launched a brand new dialog
format in 2015: “CEO Direct” is a moderated question and answer session, in
which the Chairman of the Executive Board regularly takes questions from em-
ployees ona particular focus issue.

tesa Business Segment

The tesa Business Segment is an independent part of the Beiersdorf Group that
develops, produces, and markets self-adhesive products and system solutions
for industry, craft businesses, and consumers. Consistently high quality, ex-
tremely innovative thinking, and the use of state-of-the-art technology are core
elements of its brand philosophy and strategy. tesa’s priorities lie in finding
effective solutions and high-quality products with a focus on the following
customer groups:

© tesa primarily provides system solutions for the automotive, electronics,
printing and paper, and construction industries. In the electronics industry,
tesa’s adhesive systems are used in mobile devices such as smartphones,
tablet PCs, and MP3 players.

© tesa’s affiliate tesa Labtec GmbH develops and produces transdermal systems,
also called pharmaceutical plasters, for the pharmaceutical industry. It also
focuses on medicated oral films that dissolve in the mouth without the need
for additional fluids.

tesa to respond quickly and flexibly to market changes, to design new solutions
to problems, and to develop needs-based products. tesa’s knowledge of pro-
duction processes, analysis of current industry trends, and wide range of
high-quality, market-driven products provide competitive advantages, ensuring
the long-term success of the business segment.

Management and Control

The Executive Board manages the company and is dedicated to sustainably
increasing its value. In addition to the functional areas of responsibility within
the Executive Board, there are regional areas of responsibility. The Executive
Board is closely involved in the company’s operational business in particular
through the allocation of responsibilities for the regions and markets. A break-
down of the Executive Board's areas of responsibility can be found in the chapter
“Beiersdorf AG Boards” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The tesa Business Segment is managed as an independent subgroup.

Information on the remuneration of the Executive and Supervisory Boards as
well as on incentive and bonus systems is provided in the remuneration report,
which forms part of the Group Management Report. The Corporate Governance
Statement in accordance with § 289a Hande/sgesetzbuch (German Commercial
Code, HGB) has been made publicly available on the company’s website
at WWW.BEIERSDORF.COM/CORPORATE_GOVERNANCE_STATEMENT. Additional
information regarding management and control, the general management
structure, and the Declaration of Compliance in accordance with § 161 Aktien-
gesetz (German Stock Corporation Act, AktG) is also provided in the Corporate
Governance Report.

Value Management and Performance

Management System

The goal of Beiersdorf’s business activities is to sustainably increase the com-
pany’s market share by achieving qualitative growth and, at the same time, to
expand its earnings base. The long-term key performance indicators - organic
sales growth in conjunction with market share, EBIT, and the EBIT margin before
special factors (the ratio of EBIT to sales) - are derived from this. The aim is to
generate internationally competitive returns through systematic cost manage-
ment and the highly efficient use of resources.

23

The company has created an efficient management system in order to meet
these strategic goals. Corporate management derives business performance
targets for the individual units in the Group for the coming year from the
Group's strategic business goals. This planning covers all segments and affili-
ates. Formal adoption by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the
Group's planning for the following year is generally in the fall.

Actual key performance indicators are compared with target values and with
the current forecast for the year as a whole at regular intervals during the fiscal
year. These comparisons are used to manage the business in line with the objec-
tives.

The tesa Business Segment forms a separate, independent unit within the
Group. It is also managed on the basis of sales growth, the operating result
(EBIT), and the EBIT margin.

In addition to the key financial performance indicators shown above, the com-
pany employs a number of non-financial indicators that are described in the
chapters “Research and Development,” “People at Beiersdorf,” and “Sustaina-
bility” of the Group Management Report.

Economic Environment

General Economic Situation

Global economic growth in 2015 was at the previous year’s level. However, the
outlook increasingly deteriorated over the course of the year as a result of weak
growth in emerging markets. While economic performance further improved in
industrialized countries, commodity-rich emerging markets were hit by lower
energy and commodity prices.

The European economy continued its recovery and achieved slightly higher
growth than in the previous year on the back of comparatively low commodity
costs, the depreciation of the euro, and the low interest rate level. Growing
demand within the eurozone compensated for a fall in demand from emerging
markets.

The German economy benefited from the healthy labor market, low interest
rates, and positive consumer sentiment. However, the advancing slowdown in
key emerging markets and falling demand in China adversely affected perfor-
mance. Overall, the German economy experienced moderate growth.

The economy in the United States recorded a positive performance in 2015.
Growth was bolstered by the positive trend on the labor market and rising
domestic demand. There was a moderate key interest rate increase in December.

Japan saw only moderate economic growth in 2015. The economy was affected
by weak domestic demand and the economic slowdown in China.


--- Page 6 ---

24

The picture in the emerging markets was mixed. Economic growth in China fell
short of expectations in 2015. The growth rate was at its lowest since 2009.
Rising concern about a downturn caused the overheated Chinese stock market
to crash. Reforms in India had a positive effect on economic development. The
country’s export momentum declined, however. In Brazil, the economic situa-
tion remained difficult due to poor domestic demand and low commodity prices.
The country’s output fell.

The ongoing geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the rapid
drop in crude oil prices, led to a recession and hit the region’s development.

Sales Market Trends

The global growth rate in the cosmetics market - the market relevant for
Beiersdorf - was at the prior-year level. The Asia and Latin America regions
were the main growth drivers. The saturated markets in North America and
Western Europe continued on the previous year’s growth path. Southern
Europe saw an easing of the negative trend.

In the industrial sales markets relevant for tesa, 2015 was marked by stable
growth in Europe and America together with a sharp slowdown in some cases in
the largest Asian markets. Eastern European and Latin American countries were
growth drivers. The trend in North America was also positive.

Procurement Market Trends

In 2015, raw material and packaging prices overall moved slightly lower. The
commodity environment was generally favorable, especially concerning the oil
price development. However, as the prices of the refined materials and plastic
resins are most strongly affected by supply and demand in their respective
markets, only a limited positive effect on procurement costs emerged.

Some material market prices remained very robust. In particular the markets for
palm oil derivatives and for plastic resins on the European market were very
resilient.

Overall Assessment of the Economic Environment
Macroeconomic growth in 2015 was positive, despite momentum slowing in the
course of the year. The global cosmetics market maintained the previous year’s
level of growth, although growth rates in some individual markets eased. The
Consumer Business Segment recorded another increase in sales in this challeng-
ing economic environment. The tesa Business Segment slightly increased its
sales in 2015. While the market for consumer electronics stagnated, the auto-
motive industry performed well. The US market also saw a positive trend and
drove growth along with Europe. At the same time, market conditions in China
worsened as a result of the local economic situation. The consumer market in
Europe has seen further improvement year-on-year.

SALES

Organic Group sales in 2015 were up 3.0% on the prior-year figure. The Consumer
Business Segment grew by 3.6%, while tesa generated a sales increase of 0.4%.
Nominal Group sales rose by 6.4% as against the previous year, to €6,686 mil-
lion (previous year: €6,285 million).

In Europe, organic sales were up 1.3% on the prior year. In nominal terms, sales
amounted to €3,447 million (previous year: €3,421 million), 0.8% higher than
the prior-year figure.

Organic growth in the Americas amounted to 8.1%. In nominal terms, sales in-
creased by 11.4% to €1,243 million (previous year: €1,116 million).

The Africa/Asia/Australia region reported organic growth of 3.1%. In nominal
terms, growth of 14.1% to €1,996 million was achieved (previous year: €1,748 mil-
lion).

537 671 24.9

EXPENSES / OTHER OPERATING RESULT

Cost of goods sold rose by 4.3%, and hence not as fast as sales. Projects to
enhance efficiency in production and logistics, the favorable trend in commod-
ity and energy prices, as well as product-mix effects all had a bearing on this
positive development. Thanks to the efficient use of resources, marketing and
selling expenses rose by just 5.6% to €2,430 million (previous year: €2,300 mil-
lion*) and thus also at a slower rate than sales. The advertising and trade
marketing expenses included in this item amounted to €1,529 million (previous
year: €1,486 million*). Research and development expenditure was increased to
€183 million (previous year: €168 million) in order to safeguard the future of the
concern. The increase in general and administrative expenses to €366 million
(previous year: €330 million) reflects the work carried out to improve existing
software systems, especially in the Consumer Business Segment. The other op-
erating result (excluding special factors) amounted to €40 million (previous
year: €45 million).

OPERATING RESULT (EBIT, EXCLUDING SPECIAL FACTORS)

The Beiersdorf Group’s results of operations are determined on the basis of the
operating result (EBIT) excluding special factors. This figure is not part of IFRSs
and should be treated merely as voluntary additional information. The special
factors listed are one-time, non-operating transactions.

EBIT excluding special factors rose to €962 million (previous year: €861 million),
while the EBIT margin was 14.4% (previous year: 13.7%). The Consumer Business
Segment generated EBIT excluding special factors of €771 million (previous
year: €678 million); the EBIT margin reached 13.9% (previous year: 13.0%). EBIT
in the tesa Business Segment rose from €183 million in the prior year to €191 mil-
lion in the past fiscal year; the EBIT margin was 16.8% (previous year: 17.0%).

The Group operating result before special factors in Europe was €618 million
(previous year: €589 million). The EBIT margin was 17.9% (previous year: 17.2%).
The operating result before special factors in the Americas amounted to
€104 million (previous year: €80 million). The EBIT margin was 8.4% (previous
year: 7.1%). In Africa / Asia / Australia, EBIT excluding special factors amounted to
€240 million (previous year: €192 million). The EBIT margin was 12.0% (previous
year: 11.0%).

SPECIAL FACTORS

No special factors required recognition in the 2015 fiscal year. The special
factors of €-65 million in the previous year concerned the Consumer Business
Segment and included a write-down of €67 million on our Chinese hair care
brands, and the reversal of provisions in connection with the realignment of cor-
porate structures.

OPERATING RESULT (EBIT)
EBIT including special factors was €962 million (previous year: €796 million).
This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 14.4% (previous year: 12.7%).

FINANCIAL RESULT

The financial result amounted to €6 million (previous year: €15 million). Against
a backdrop of stable interest income from financial assets and interest expend-
iture from financial liabilities, this decrease was the result of an expense item of
€7 million from a tax reassessment (as compared with a refund of €9 million in
the previous year). Thanks to gains from financial assets, the other financial
result was €6 million above the prior-year figure despite unfavorable currency-
exchange effects.

INCOME TAXES
Income taxes amounted to €297 million (previous year: €274 million). The tax
rate was 30.7% (previous year: 33.8%).

PROFIT AFTER TAX

Profit after tax increased to €671 million (previous year: €537 million; excluding
special factors: €581 million); the return on sales after tax was 10.0% (previous
year: 8.5%; excluding special factors: 9.2%).

EARNINGS PER SHARE - DIVIDENDS

Earnings per share were €2.91 (previous year: €2.33; excluding special factors:
€2.53). These figures were calculated on the basis of the weighted number of
shares bearing dividend rights (226,818,984). The Executive Board and Super-
visory Board will propose a dividend of €0.70 per no-par value share bearing
dividend rights to the Annual General Meeting (previous year: €0.70). For
further information on the number, type, and notional value of the shares,
please refer to note 17 “Share Capital” in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

Sales by the Consumer Business Segment grew organically by 3.6% in 2015. The
weak euro on average during the year led to an increase of 3.1 percentage points
in this figure as a result of positive effects from currency translation. Structural
changes reduced growth by 0.2 percentage points. In nominal terms, sales
increased by 6.5% to €5,546 million (previous year: €5,209 million).

The healthy organic sales trend is proof of the systematic implementation of our
business strategy, the Blue Agenda. Thanks to our strong innovations and
outstanding marketing concepts, we increased our market share in both the
saturated markets of Europe and the emerging markets, where we achieved
double-digit growth rates in some cases. Our core brands, NIVEA and Eucerin,
once again produced very encouraging growth rates.

NIVEA achieved global organic growth of 4.5% in 2015. The key growth drivers
were NIVEA Deo, NIVEA Shower and the NIVEA All-Purpose Creams. In the
NIVEA Deo category, NIVEA Black & White and NIVEA Fresh remained particu-
larly strong, generating double-digit growth once again. The successful intro-
duction of NIVEA Protect & Care in the Latin American market also fueled
growth. The launch of NIVEA Active Clean and NIVEA Cream Smooth was a
significant growth driver for NIVEA Shower. The growth in the category of
NIVEA All-Purpose Creams was generated in particular by the newly introduced
product NIVEA Care Cream.

Overall, NIVEA gained market shares in the core categories and a large majority
of our key markets. In the NIVEA Deo category, we extended our market share

particularly in Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Russia. In our NIVEA Hand and
Body category, growth in Japan, Russia, and Brazil had a positive impact on our
market share. In the NIVEA Sun category, we continued to see negative market
share trends particularly in Italy and Japan. At the country level, very good
growth in market share was achieved in South Africa, Spain, Russia, Japan, and
the United Kingdom. A negative trend was seen in Italy, China, and Thailand.

Our Eucerin brand generated organic growth of 5.4%. The Eucerin Face and the
Eucerin Sun categories made particularly strong contributions to this positive
performance. Sales were especially strong in France, Spain, South Africa, and
Korea.

In the exclusive cosmetics segment, our La Prairie brand recorded an organic
increase in sales of 1.2%. This was driven in particular by the Caviar Collection as
well as the launch of the Anti-Aging Rapid Response Booster and the Skin Caviar
Concealer Foundation. Meanwhile, a reduction in the travel retail business had a
negative impact on growth.

Results of operations in the European markets were very stable. Further invest-
ments in brand building and strengthening our position were made in the
emerging markets, even though this led to losses in a few markets.

EBIT excluding special factors was €771 million (previous year: €678 million),
while the corresponding EBIT margin increased to 13.9% (previous year: 13.0%).

Sales in Europe were up 1.3% on the prior-year figure despite challenging market
conditions in some cases. In nominal terms, sales increased by 0.7% to
€2,816 million (previous year: €2,799 million).

In Western Europe, sales were down 0.3% on the previous year. While strong
sales growth was achieved in Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom in
particular, a number of other markets, including Italy and Switzerland, were
unable to repeat their prior-year performance. Sales of NIVEA Deo and NIVEA
All-Purpose Creams performed well. Eucerin also saw strong growth.

AMERICAS

Sales in Eastern Europe rose by 7.9%. Growth was mainly driven by the very
healthy trend in Russia, which recorded a rise in both sales and market share.
Sales and market share also increased in Ukraine. NIVEA Deo, NIVEA MEN, and
NIVEA All-Purpose Creams in particular performed extremely well. La Prairie
saw extremely strong growth in the region. In contrast, Eucerin was unable to
reach the previous year’s level.

Organic sales in the Americas region rose by 8.4%. At €1,076 million, nominal
sales were up 10.6% on the previous year (€973 million) due to exchange rate
changes affecting the US dollar.

Sales in North America were up 3.9% on the previous year. Good sales growth
was produced particularly in the United States. NIVEA Body performed very
well. Eucerin Aquaphor and La Prairie also generated good growth.

Sales in Latin America were up by 10.9%, fueled by very good growth rates in
Argentina, Columbia, Peru, and Mexico. Growth rates were negatively impacted
by developments in Venezuela. NIVEA Deo and NIVEA Shower performed
extremely well. Eucerin also saw very strong growth.

Stabilizing sales in China and our continued excellent performance in South
Africa, Japan, India, and Turkey were the basis for the improved sales perfor-
mance. NIVEA Deo, NIVEA Shower and NIVEA All-Purpose Creams in particular
performed extremely well. Eucerin and La Prairie also experienced very good

Organic sales by the tesa Business Segment were up 0.4% on the previous year.
Exchange rate effects increased this figure by 5.5 percentage points. In nominal
terms, sales therefore rose by 5.9% to €1,140 million (previous year: €1,076 mil-
lion). EBIT increased to €191 million (previous year: €183 million). The EBIT
margin was 16.8% (previous year: 17.0%).

tesa INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS

Industrial business sales grew organically by 0.1%. Business in the Americas
generated strong growth. In Asia, however, tesa saw a sharp decline in its sales,
which are primarily generated from project business. In nominal terms, sales

rose by 7.6% to €854 million (previous year: €793 million). The share of the In-
dustrial Business in total sales was 74.9% (previous year: 73.7%).

In the electronics industry business, tesa strengthened its market-leading
position with removable adhesive tapes of the Bond&Detach” series for use in
bonding batteries to smartphones. The new versions deliver even better perfor-
mance, particularly under shock conditions. The successful market introduction
of barrier tapes for flexible displays based on OLED technology shows particular
promise. In spite of these successes, the business area was impacted by market
weakness and the increasing saturation of the smartphone market in Asia.

Many new products and strong international sales activities generated impor-
tant momentum in the automotive area. One example of this is the new version
of ACXplus, a high-performance adhesive tape with viscoelastic material prop-
erties. It is used to secure auto components like emblems, molding, and anten-
nas. For two-tone painting of car bodies, tesa offers complete masking systems
with applicator, establishing new benchmarks in the technical implementation
of this trend.

tesa is also setting the pace in the printing and paper business. A key sales driver
was the product line for flexographic printing, a range that is about to be re-
launched. This process is used in such areas as the printing of flexible packaging
made of such materials as plastic. The work to optimize tesa’s products involves
improving process features, streamlining assemble technology, as well as work-
ing with new sealing hardness levels and altered bonding agents. The excep-
tional printing qualities are unaffected in the process.

The Pharma business area generated growth in contract manufacturing. In
addition, the production capacities of medicated plasters and fast-dissolving
oral films were significantly expanded. As a result, the European market intro-
duction for two new products could be prepared. The delivery of products for
Canada began. In addition, development agreements that will secure future
growth were concluded in the North America region.

In the area of tesa scribos®, tesa produces comprehensive and tailored solutions
for anti-counterfeiting and anti-tampering products for customers in a broad
range of businesses. We further expanded our market share, in both existing
markets and in other segments as well. One reason for this growth was contracts
with a leading Chinese manufacturer of e-cigarettes that began to protect its
products with tesa VeoMark® coded labels in 2015. In addition, newly developed
security seals like tesa® HighPerSeal Tape were successfully introduced to the
market.

In the Building Supply business area, an expanding base of customers for
ACXplus products and PE foams were a key driver of new growth. Products
based on the patented ACXplus technology are especially well-suited for secur-
ing windows and doors made of PVC, wood, and aluminum. tesa also offers
system solutions for constructive bonding applications. As a result, energy-
saving or design-related plans like the combination of different materials can be
easily carried out. This business also focuses on providing solutions that create
weather-resistant bonds of facade components.

Although its industrial distribution business during the fiscal year was shaped in
particular by competitive pressure exerted by discounters, tesa performed
steadily during the period. A driver of its business was the expansion of its prod-
uct range for innovative mounting tapes, especially ACXplus products. Intensive
contact with specialized technical retailers generated further growth as well.

tesa CONSUMER BUSINESS

The consumer products and professional craftsmen business, which is focused
on Europe and Latin America, performed well, with organic sales growth of
2.8%. In nominal terms, sales increased by 2.8% to €264 million (previous year:
€257 million). As a result, the consumer business contributed 23.1% (previous
year: 23.8%) of total sales by the tesa Business Segment.

tesa strengthened its market position in the two strategic business areas and in
all regions making up the Consumer & Craftsmen segment. This applied both to
its DIY solutions and products for the office supplies and stationery sector in the
consumer business and to its offering for professional craftsmen in the crafts-
men business area. A key contribution to this performance was made by an
international branding campaign that was successfully continued in 2015.

The tense political situation in Russia and Greece continued to impact business
there. In contrast, tesa initiated new customer projects with high growth poten-
tial in such markets as the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
and Luxembourg.

Non-current assets increased by €345 million to €2,685 million (previous year:
€2,340 million). Long-term securities were reclassified to current assets due to
shorter maturities and new purchases were made. This item increased by
€256 million to €1,297 million (previous year: €1,041 million). Capital expenditure
on property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets amounted to €249 mil-
lion (previous year: €301 million). Of this amount, €135 million (previous year:
€201 million) related to the Consumer Business Segment and €114 million
(previous year: €100 million) to the tesa Business Segment. The change is mainly
attributable to investment in new Consumer and tesa factories and tesa’s new
headquarters. Group depreciation, amortization, and impairment losses
amounted to €129 million (previous year: €179 million). The prior-year figure
includes impairment losses of €67 million on our Chinese hair care brands. In-
ventories fell by €14 million to €772 million (previous year: €786 million). Other
current assets increased to €2,498 million (previous year: €2,228 million). This
item includes short-term securities of €858 million (previous year: €562 mil-
lion). Trade receivables fell by €17 million to €1,258 million (previous year:
€1,275 million). Income tax receivables fell by €13 million to €100 million, while
other current assets decreased by €3 million to €167 million.

Cash and cash equivalents declined to €918 million (previous year: €976 million).
Net liquidity (cash, cash equivalents, and long- and short-term securities less
current liabilities to banks) increased by €509 million to €3,036 million (previ-
ous year: €2,527 million). Current liabilities to banks fell by €15 million to
€37 million (previous year: €52 million).

Total non-current provisions and liabilities decreased year-on-year to €746 mil-
lion (previous year: €773 million). This change was caused by two counteracting
effects. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits fell to
€574 million (previous year: €627 million) due to a slight increase in the dis-
count rate, while deferred tax liabilities rose to €88 million (previous year:
€69 million). Total current provisions and liabilities rose by €9 million to
€1,926 million (previous year: €1,917 million) as a result of an increase in trade
payables due to operational factors. The equity ratio increased to 61% (previous
year: 58%). Non-current liabilities accounted for 11% (previous year: 12%) and
current liabilities for 28% (previous year: 30%).

Gross cash flow amounted to €770 million in the period under review, up
€172 million on the prior-year value.

The change in working capital led to an inflow of €30 million (previous year:
outflow of €201 million). This comprised a €2 million increase in receivables and
other assets and an €18 million increase in trade payables and current provi-
sions. Inventories fell by €14 million.

The net cash outflow from investing activities amounted to €655 million in the
period under review (previous year: €230 million). Net cash outflows from secu-
rities of €551 million and capital expenditure of €249 million on property, plant,
and equipment, and intangible assets were offset by €72 million in interest and
other financial income received, and proceeds of €73 million from the sale of
property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets.

Free cash flow was €145 million, down €22 million on the prior-year value
(€167 million). The net cash outflow of €210 million from financing activities
(previous year: €192 million) mainly comprised the Beiersdorf AG dividend pay-
ment of €159 million, and interest and other financing expenses paid in the
amount of €36 million.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €918 million (previous year: €976 mil-
lion).

Financing and Liquidity Provision

The primary goal of financial management at Beiersdorf is to safeguard liquidity.
The type and volume of transactions are in line with the Group’s basic operating
and financial business. Scenarios and rolling 12-month cash flow planning are
used to establish liquidity requirements.

Overall Assessment of the Group’s Economic Position
Business developments in 2015 show that Beiersdorf is on the right track. The
Group’s two business segments performed well. Group sales amounted to
€6,686 million (previous year: €6,285 million). Organic growth amounted to
3.0% (previous year: 4.7%). EBIT excluding special factors amounted to
€962 million (previous year: €861 million). The EBIT margin excluding special
factors amounted to 14.4% (previous year: 13.7%).

The Consumer Business Segment made successful progress thanks to the
systematic implementation of the business strategy, which is based on the Blue
Agenda. This strategic compass aims to make Beiersdorf more competitive and
to enhance its economic success. Its success can be seen particularly in the
performance recorded by the emerging markets and the launch of new,
high-selling products.

Although the tesa Business Segment managed to expand business both in the
industrial markets and in the consumer business, it did record a decline in sales
from project business in Asia.

At 3.6%, sales growth in the Consumer Business Segment was in the middle of Consumer

the target range of 3-5% that was forecast for fiscal year 2015. This was due in
particular to the healthy trend in the growth markets. The operating result (EBIT,
excluding special factors) and the EBIT margin both increased in fiscal year 2015
as forecast.

The tesa Business Segment again recorded a positive performance in the past
fiscal year. With sales growth of 0.4%, it managed to equal the previous year’s
high level. The operating result (EBIT, excluding special factors) and the EBIT
margin both remained at the prior-year level in fiscal year 2015 as forecast.

Judgments by Management

No accounting policies were applied and no related options were exercised in
the consolidated financial statements that differ from those in prior years and
that, if applied or exercised differently, would have had a material effect on the
results of operations, net assets, and financial position. Information on the
effects of the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments by management
can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Research and Development

Beiersdorf’s expertise in the area of research and development has been driving
our company’s success for more than 130 years.

© The Consumer Business Segment develops innovative, high-quality skin care
products that are tailored to the needs and wishes of consumers worldwide.

© The tesa Business Segment develops high-performance self-adhesive system
and product solutions, and is a world leader in its field.

At the end of 2015, 1,108 people were employed in Beiersdorf’s Research and
Development area (previous year: 1,071). Of this total, 637 (previous year: 602)
worked in the Consumer Business Segment and 471 (previous year: 469) in the
tesa Business Segment.

LEADING-EDGE SKIN CARE EXPERTISE

Beiersdorf is globally known for its leading skin care expertise. Our research and
development activities aim to define skin care of the future. The effort focuses
on addressing consumer demand for efficacious yet mild products more than
ever before.

In the year under review, a Beiersdorf research cooperation with the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH) showed how skin cells naturally
protect themselves against stress caused by environmental influences. The re-
searchers discovered that skin cells defend themselves by using the “first line
response,” a key rapid change in skin cell metabolism. This mechanism enables
skin cells to counteract within minutes stress caused by, for example, solar radi-
ation or oxidative stress. This important insight can be used to develop future
skin care products to prevent environmentally induced skin sensitivity and aging
by fortifying the identified natural skin function. The work was highlighted by
“Molecular Cell”, one of the most highly respected science journals.

Also during the reporting period, a cooperative project between researchers
from the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in Nice and
Beiersdorf discovered a molecular mechanism that leads to melasma, one of the
most common discolorations that affects consumers with darker complexions.
The research group is currently exploiting this discovery to deliver solutions for
this skin disorder.

Sensitive skin is another major skin disorder that Beiersdorf’s research focuses on.
Many people with sensitive skin suffer from skin inflammation. Our researchers
found effective soothing agents that helped develop skin-calming cosmetic
products. In 2015, one highly recognized result involved Licochalcone A, a sub-
stance contained in licorice that has a positive effect on a key inflammatory
pathway in the skin. The active ingredient with its antioxidant properties also
helps the skin activate its own defenses against UV stress.

At Beiersdorf, product safety and tolerability are our top priority. Remarkable
progress has been made in the core methods for cosmetic safety, eye irritation,
skin sensitization and genotoxicity. Alternative methods for these endpoints are

now undergoing the official acceptance process at the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Scientific Committee
on Consumer Safety (SCCS) of the European Commission. We also achieved
progress in our work to identify skin-irritating substances at an early stage of
our research and thus prevent the possibility of allergic reactions.

OPEN TO IDEAS FROM THE OUTSIDE

Beiersdorf’s Research and Development unit drives the integration of internal
as well as external knowledge and ideas to create outstanding products. This
objective is achieved through close relationships with leading research institutes,
universities, and suppliers as well as through our Open Innovation network
Pearlfinder, where Beiersdorf scientists post technical challenges and our
external partners submit possible solutions.

Examples of our Open Innovation activities in 2015 included:

© The launch of the new NIVEA Protect & Shave Razor, which was the result of
a close, long-term partnership between our Research and Development unit
and the Japanese razor blade manufacturer Kai.

© Inits second year, the Beiersdorf Innovation Pitch attracted many ideas from
exhibitors at the “in-cosmetics” trade fair in Barcelona, Spain. The three
winning contributions now have an opportunity to develop their projects
through our strong brands NIVEA and Eucerin.

© With our new Open Innovation format Supplier Fair, we opened the doors of
our Research and Development unit for the first time, welcoming three
long-standing strategic partners to present functional raw materials and
their application in our particular categories.

© Our Open Innovation initiative was intensified with a focus on regional devel-
opment laboratories. The closeness to innovation hot spots and consumers in
the respective regions led to some unique products and innovation partner
relationships.

EXPANSION OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES

To best meet consumers’ needs around the world, we further strengthened our
regional and local development activities. We conduct regional consumer tests
to customize product formulas and design specified packaging solutions. Being
close to the market allows a fast and precise adoption of the local needs and the
development of regional innovations.

In 2015, we expanded the development laboratories for the Far East in Wuhan,
China, which is now our biggest development location outside Beiersdorf’s
headquarters laboratories in Hamburg. In Sanand, India, we opened a develop-
ment laboratory located on the premises of the new production facility. Solu-
tions are developed there for the Near East region, which has a distinct market
diversity and large outreach within our global network. One of the first tasks of
the newly completed laboratory was to test and refine the formulation and
packaging for the NIVEA MEN Body Deodorizer. The product was especially

created for Indian consumers and provides day-long control of body odor
through a single application per day.

Another expansion of activities in the regions took place in Silao, Mexico. In the
year under review, the team began working in new, fully equipped laboratories
to develop innovations for Latin America and North America. The focus here is
on deodorant, body, sun, and cleansing products specifically designed for the
local markets. A good example from Silao is the development and launch of
NIVEA Aclarado Natural Deodorant, which is designed to help recover the natural
skin tone of the armpit.

CLOSE TO CONSUMERS

Beiersdorf’s approach to localization goes hand in hand with our intention to
further integrate consumers’ needs and wishes into all steps of product devel-
opment, from idea creation to post-launch assessment. Through our consumer
integration approach, Beiersdorf employees connect with and observe con-
sumers, e.g. while they shop and under special product-use conditions, using
traditional as well as state-of-the-art digital research technologies. In the year
under review, Beiersdorf conducted about 1,800 studies with approximately
38,000 participants in all regions.

INNOVATIONS

The Consumer Business Segment filed patents for 61 innovations in the year
under review (previous year: 76), and its products repeatedly set significant
new market trends.

In 2015, key innovations included:

© NIVEA Care Creme for face, body, and hands offers intensive nourishment for
more than 24 hours, providing a light and soft skin feeling without greasiness.
The new NIVEA Care range addresses the specific needs of our female con-
sumers. It consists of an intensively nourishing cream, a product for an im-
proved skin tone, and an anti-aging cream. All three products were launched
in 2015 in different markets.

© NIVEA CELLular Anti-Age is one of the most popular anti-aging care product
ranges in Europe, having won the 2015 Nielsen European Breakthrough
Innovation Award among more than 8,000 initiatives launched in Europe.
The new line extension NIVEA CELLular Radiance continues this success and
provides a more youthful radiance with both instant and long-term visible
results. The benefit agents support skin functions on a cellular level and the
soft pigments deliver instant improved skin appearance.

© Asa result of continuous research to identify a superior and skin-friendly
deodorant, NIVEA launched the first set of products with an innovative tech-

BARRIER TAPES FOR FLEXIBLE DISPLAYS

In 2015, tesa developed new technologies for barrier tapes with unusually high
resistance to humidity. We are receiving an increasing number of requests,
especially from the electronics industry, for technologies that enable products
such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays to be made sufficiently
durable. As part of a project supported by the German Federal Ministry of
Education and Research, tesa worked with the technology companies Schott
and Von Ardenne to develop new technologies for the use of ultra-thin glass
on roll in future OLED applications.

We have also worked on new adhesive tapes that ensure even more secure
bonding of frames and displays in cell phones and tablet PCs. Between the
adhesive layers, these tapes contain additional foamed layers that provide very
high mechanical strength.

ADHESIVE MASSES FOR TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS.

tesa also made progress in developing new adhesive masses to meet evolving
requirements in 2015. One example of such requirements is the need for even
greater adhesive strength on problematic surfaces, such as dirt-repellant car

35

finishes or the very non-polar plastics used in the electronics industry. Targeted
composition of polymer chains for acrylate-based adhesive masses plays an im-
portant role here. To this end, we have further developed existing polymeriza-
tion processes and combined them with new technologies. The new processes
have been successfully tested on a pilot scale and are now being moved to pro-
duction scale.

HIGH BONDING STRENGTH IN CONTACT WITH CHEMICALS
Another example is the development of adhesive mass systems with very high
resistance to a wide range of chemicals. This is an important property whenever
electronic products like smartphones, tablet PCs, and wearables come into
contact with the skin or household chemicals such as cleaning agents. The new
adhesive masses maintain their adhesive strength even under these difficult
conditions.

Sustainability

At Beiersdorf, “Care” is not only part of our core business, but also one of our
Core Values. It describes our responsibility towards our fellow human beings
and the environment. Beiersdorf’s commitment to care sets out to inspire
people both inside and outside the company and to strengthen the company’s
relationships with employees, suppliers, and consumers.

Consumer

Beiersdorf's “We care.” sustainability strategy gives the company a clear focus
on sustainable, responsible growth. We have defined objectives for the three
areas of activity “Products,” “Planet,” and “People,” which we aim to fulfill by
2020. We regularly review our progress using environmental and social perfor-
mance indicators to ensure that our commitment is far-reaching, has a long-
term impact, and supports the objectives of Beiersdorf's business strategy, the
Blue Agenda.

We already exceeded one of our sustainability goals: CO, emissions per sold
product were cut sharply. As a result, we reached our objective well before the
target date of 2020. We are currently formulating a new target for the “Planet”
area of activity in order to continue improving our environmental performance.

By 2020, we aim for the areas “Products” and “People” to:

© generate 50% of our sales from products with a significantly reduced environ-
mental impact (base year 2011), and

© reach and improve the lives of one million families (base year 2013).

We pushed ahead with measures throughout the company during the reporting
period in order to swiftly achieve these targets.

PRODUCTS

Beiersdorf uses life cycle assessments to measure and reduce the environ-
mental impact of products. This method is based on data relating to raw mate-
rials, our own manufacturing processes, transportation, product use, recycling,
and disposal. In 2015, we developed a simulation tool for packaging design,
which enables us to easily evaluate the environmental impact of alternative
packaging.

In addition to packaging, we also analyze the environmental compatibility of the
raw materials used in our products’ formulas. We worked closely with suppliers
in the year under review to elaborate sustainability criteria that will be applied
in formula development from 2016 onward. This will enable us to improve the
environmental compatibility of future products at an early stage of develop-
ment.

Beiersdorf has also made progress in transitioning to sustainable palm (kernel)
oil. Our aim is to use only ingredients from proven sustainable sources (Certified
Sustainable Palm Kernel Oil). By 2020, we intend to switch the respective ingre-
dients to segregated or at least mass balanced palm (kernel) oil and corre-
sponding derivatives. Until the transition is complete, we will offset the share of
raw materials that have not yet been converted with “GreenPalm” certificates.
We have already sourced seven mass balanced raw materials in 2015. At the
same time, we have initiated multi-site certification in accordance with the
supply chain certification standard defined by the Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO). Beiersdorf remains a member of the revamped Forum for
Sustainable Palm Oil (FONAP).

PLANET

In order to better identify and reduce logistics emissions, we began using a new
software to calculate transport emissions in Europe in 2014. In the year under
review, the software was rolled out in the regions Latin America and the Far
East.

Our facility management is also based on the principle of resource efficiency.
The German production facilities in Hamburg, Berlin, and Waldheim were certi-
fied according to the ISO 50001 standard in 2014. The required recertification
took place in 2015, demonstrating the high level of energy efficiency and energy
management at Beiersdorf.

The factory we opened in Sanand, India, in 2015 comprises an extremely effi-
cient water treatment system, which cleans sewage to sucha high standard that
it can be reused in the production process to reduce total water consumption,
or be allowed to drain away naturally on the site. We also planted around 650
trees at the Sanand facility. These help the soil to absorb water and also make a
contribution to reforestation.

We achieved gold “Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design” (LEED)
certification with the expansion of our facility in Chile. Key factors contributing
to this excellent rating included the building’s energy efficiency, optimal use of
daylight, and efficient ventilation systems.

PEOPLE
Our long-standing commitment to families is deeply rooted in Beiersdorf’s Core
Values and those of our brands, especially NIVEA. NIVEA supports families all

over the world with locally relevant, long-term projects through its global
“NIVEA cares for family” initiative. This initiative focuses on three areas:

© developing children’s skills,
© supporting mothers,
© giving families the opportunity to spend time with each other.

NIVEA India has launched the “Mom’s Touch” initiative as part of “NIVEA cares
for family.” Together with the strategic partner Aseema, NIVEA is helping mothers
with low incomes ensure that their children can go to school. The initiative
supports these mothers and their families with a monthly food parcel. The pro-
ject is accompanied by workshops and communication initiatives exploring how
the mothers can act as a role model. The “Mom’s Touch” initiative is continuing
in Mumbai and also being expanded to schools in Ahmedabad - the region
where NIVEA India recently opened a new production facility. Five hundred
families had participated in the project by the end of 2015.

To enable local families to spend time together and promote children’s develop-
ment, NIVEA Poland has built or repaired 40 playgrounds. A broad publicity
campaign called on Polish consumers to nominate the 40 sites where play-
grounds should be renovated or newly built. With many playgrounds in poor
condition, the campaign met with a great response: 3.6 million people, or
around 10% of Poland's population, took part in the vote.

“99% of the time nothing happens, but a first aid course is 100% worthwhile”:
this was the guiding principle behind Hansaplast’s “Bringing First Aid Home”
initiative in 2015. The aim was to motivate as many people as possible to take
part in a first aid course. Since 2013, Hansaplast has been collaborating world-
wide with national branches of the Red Cross to improve first aid knowledge
and skills as well as people’s confidence in using them. A particular focus is on
boosting children’s knowledge of first aid.

Beiersdorf aims to further reduce the number of work-related accidents with its
company-wide “Zero Accident” initiative. We are continually improving work-
place safety using a range of approaches. In 2015, we introduced “Safety
Weeks” at our European locations, for example. Our occupational health and
safety experts inspect facilities for possible sources of danger that could cause
serious accidents, then work to eliminate these.

RESPONSIBILITY

Corporate responsibility toward society and the environment was once again
the focus of tesa’s sustainable business strategy in 2015. We attach great impor-
tance to making a significant contribution to social development and enhancing
our environmental management system.

As an environmentally aware business, we are constantly examining whether
there are more environmentally friendly alternatives for certain raw materials
used in the production process. We have been consistently developing our en-
vironmental management system since 2001 and have regularly outperformed
our ambitious targets for protecting the environment throughout this period.
For example, our production locations around the world have more than halved


--- Page 19 ---

Beiersdorf Annual Report 2015 / Group Management Report / Sustainability
People at Beiersdorf

their emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) since 2001, and have sig-
nificantly reduced the amount of waste produced, CO, emissions, and solvent
usage. All of the company’s production facilities are certified in accordance with
ISO 14001, the international environmental standard.

tesa’s environmental management activities in the year under review focused
on improving energy management and reducing CO; emissions.

Energy management at our two largest production facilities in Offenburg and
Hamburg were certified in accordance with ISO 50001 in 2015. tesa’s new head-
quarters in Norderstedt, built in compliance with the new German Energy
Saving Regulation (ENEV 2014), will follow in 2016.

The environmentally friendly electricity generated by a combined heat and
power plant at the Offenburg location since late 2014 has already led to substan-
tial reductions in CO, emissions in the year under review. This state-of-the-art
technology will be implemented at tesa’s Hamburg location in 2016 and will also
be examined as an option for other production facilities.

Taking social responsibility is a core component of tesa’s corporate policy. We
are therefore supporting a host of diverse projects under the motto “tesa
connects” as part of our worldwide corporate citizenship program.

© Our employees provide practical support to communities with our “tesa
helps” initiative and support social, environmental, and cultural organiza-
tions with various projects at tesa locations. In Hamburg, for example, we
successfully continued our work with the “tatkraftig - Hande fir Hamburg”
initiative, which helps to match potential volunteers with organizations that
need help. In Belgium, employees helped athletes with intellectual disabili-
ties to participate in the Special Olympics National Games sponsored by tesa.

© “tesa donates” supports the work of a number of institutions with donations
in kind and financial contributions. tesa also donates to disaster aid. Earth-
quake victims in Nepal were among the beneficiaries in the year under
review.

© As a technology-based company, we understand the importance of educa-
tion. That is why we cooperate with the “Initiative Naturwissenschaft und
Technik” (Science and Technology Initiative, NAT) under “tesa fosters.” In the
year under review, we supported about 20 senior grade students at a Ham-
burg secondary school, who had chosen studies focused on science and
technology.

© The “tesa protects” initiative is part of a long-term partnership supporting
the UNESCO biosphere reserve Niedersachsische Elbtalaue. The most impor-
tant aspect of this is the voluntary commitment of tesa employees. Their
practical work includes planting young oak trees, for example, in order to
maintain this highly biodiverse and environmentally sensitive floodplain
landscape.

All our sustainability activities are documented in an annual progress report
that is available at wwW.TESA.COM/RESPONSIBILITY.

People at Beiersdorf

As a clear sign of confidence in business growth and international expansion,
the Beiersdorf Group created 261 new jobs worldwide in 2015. By the end of De-
cember 2015 we employed 17,659 people globally (2014: 17,398). Of this figure,
5,962 (2014: 5,860), or 34% (2014: 34%), were employed in Germany. A total of
13,549 people worked in the Consumer Business Segment (2014: 13,317) and
4,110 in the tesa Business Segment (2014: 4,081).

A CARING EMPLOYER

Everyone counts. This is the Beiersdorf philosophy of caring about people. We
are determined to support people’s well-being and promote their personal
and professional growth. Offering encouragement and inspiration so that all
employees can continuously learn and develop themselves is our objective, one
that we pursue with dedicated programs at the global, regional, and country
levels.

At Beiersdorf, we believe that a committed workforce is essential to achieving
both efficiency and innovation. Across all the markets in which we operate, we
are known for being a caring employer that attends to all major aspects of an
employment relationship. Our employee services and programs are customized
to meet specific local needs and include child care, elderly care, health manage-
ment, sport, catering, transportation, and, of course, flexible working arrange-
ments. In Germany we practice more than 300 different working-time models
that include working from home, job sharing, and very flexible part-time work
customized to meet the needs of individuals and teams.

At the same time, we believe at Beiersdorf that being a caring employer also
means challenging our employees. We cultivate a working environment in
which individuals are encouraged to take ownership and try new ideas. This is
reflected in our many successful business and organizational projects carried
out across borders and functions. Our large number of international assign-
ments is another example of our approach of “caring through challenging.”

LIVING OUR CORE VALUES

Beiersdorf's four Core Values - Care, Simplicity, Courage, and Trust - have been
the defining principles of our company for more than 130 years. In 2014, they
formed the basis of a long-term culture project that continues to involve all our
affiliates and employees. Results from the 2015 global employee survey showed
a very high level of identification of our employees with these values. The Core
Value initiative has established itself as an excellent global platform to discuss,
review and improve leadership quality and management effectiveness.

In 2015, we also integrated our Core Values into such key HR management tools
as performance management, employee dialog, or assessment tools. In this
area, we have focused on encouraging employees to take action rather than on
establishing formal processes, and we fostered initiatives to further enhance an
open and insightful feedback culture within the company. At Beiersdorf, feed-
back is always both top-down and bottom-up. Feedback as we understand and
practice it not only comprises having the courage to talk, but also the skill and


--- Page 20 ---

38

ability to listen. We find this understanding reflected in our Core Values “Trust”
and “Courage” and the management practices related to it. During 2015, we in-
creased the frequency and the variety of formats on mutual feedback between
managers and employees. Instead of a one-size-fits-all method that is used
once a year, we encourage and help our people talk about things they truly care
about - any subject at any time.

We take a more pragmatic approach regarding the proof of success in areas like
values and culture. Interpersonal relationships and interactions at work involve
such complicated brain processes that they can hardly be measured directly,
even less so in a 12-month interval. Instead of artificially creating key perfor-
mance indicators (KPls) for these fields, we believe the agility and resilience
shown by our global workforce in a highly challenging business environment
like 2015 was the best evidence that our people, our values, and our culture are
the engines behind Beiersdorf’s continuous business success.

DEVELOPING LEADERS

Leadership development has no secret recipes and does not require new cam-
paigns each and every year. Reliability and consistency are by far more relevant
success factors. In 2015, we continued practicing what we believe in as part of
our Blue Agenda and Core Values framework:

© Authenticity: Self-awareness and self-reflection are essential traits for leaders
at Beiersdorf. Only those able to be truthful to themselves can develop trust
and act as role models in their day-to-day management activities.

© Inspiring: Being authentic is not the only important trait of leaders at
Beiersdorf. True leadership means influencing and motivating others to give
their best by actively managing individual working relationships.

© Living Core Values: Managers at Beiersdorf serve as role models for living our
Core Values, putting them into practice in their work-life practices.

© Performance: Our managers know they do not merely “drive” performance.
Sustaining a high level of performance is the natural outcome of authentic
role modeling, empowerment, and individual coaching of employees.

All our leadership programs worldwide, regardless whether they are formal or
informal, draw from these leading principles. Developing true leaders within the
company requires this high level of conviction, clarity, consistency, and patience
in the years to come as well.

GUIDING CAREER GROWTH

Every single employee makes a significant contribution to Beiersdorf’s economic
success with his or her individual skills. In 2015, we took our first step toward
demonstrating a clear commitment to all our talented employees in terms of
understanding and appreciating “Career@Beiersdorf”:

© CAREER refers to an overall professional life that today often spans four or
more decades: Take a long-term view.

© CAREER is not THE purpose of life, but rather one of the possible rewards of
it: Don’t be a “career seeker,” do your best, always.

© CAREER encompasses many unknowns and surprises, despite all the plans:
Be open, be flexible.

© Your CAREER will have many helpers: The one that steers it is always you.

Asa global employer, we not only emphasize long-term thinking in our business
practices and our people: We are also proud of having a long and proven track
record of implementing this approach.

Our extensive investment in fostering the capabilities and skills of our employ-
ees, regardless of their level, function, and location in the company, continued
in 2015. This was also true of our global processes for talent reviews and succes-
sion planning. The revived spirit of “Career@Beiersdorf” will enhance the effec-
tiveness of all these investments in the years to come. Today’s caring employer
does not just rely on appropriate development tools and programs alone. We
also do our best to stimulate our employees’ individual sense of ownership of
their careers. In addition, we believe it is important to be open and honest about
the risks and uncertainties that can arise along a person’s career path.

Beiersdorf Annual Report 2015 / Group Management Report / People at Beiersdorf

The long-term reward for being a caring employer is the greater number of
emotionally engaged employees who are self-confident about their own profes-
sional growth and show self-initiative in this area.

ACHIEVING HIGH EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

For the third consecutive year we invited all our employees worldwide to partici-
pate in our employee engagement survey. A total of 93% responded within the
two-week survey period, marking a new all-time high. In almost all categories
covered by the survey, be it working conditions, communication and feedback,
or personal development, we again achieved above-average gains. The overall
results were presented throughout the company and publicly discussed. Results
for individual teams were intentionally made available only to the respective
team. In taking this approach, we ensure a trusting environment in which open
discussions could take place and relevant improvements be made. For the same
reason, improvement of survey results at the team level was not allowed to be
part of individual annual target setting.

We do measure engagement. But we are not preoccupied with numbers. In other
words: more focus on improvement measures than improvement of numbers.
With that, higher employee engagement has been, and will remain, a natural
outcome.

PROMOTING DIVERSITY
Each year, we reach consumers in over 170 countries with our skin care products.
Diversity is in our DNA.

Above all else, we value diversity in the sense of bringing together the largest
possible mix of experiences, points of view, and individuals under the Beiersdorf
roof. Within this context, we consider diversity in, for example, gender, inter-
nationality, and age a contribution to Beiersdorf’s ongoing worldwide success.

Further progress was made regarding diversity in 2015, including:

© Gender diversity: In 2015, the new legislation on equal participation of women
and men in management positions was introduced in Germany. Three years
prior to this legislation, Beiersdorf had already committed itself to increasing
the share of women in senior executive positions in Germany from 22.5% at
the time of this decision to 30% by 2020. By the end of 2015, this figure had
risen to 27.5%. The definition of “management levels” according to the new
law deviates slightly from the definition Beiersdorf had been employing.
Consequently, we have adjusted our figures, and they are now in full accor-
dance with the law. At the end of 2015, 26% of managers on the first manage-
ment level below the Executive Board were women. We aim to raise this
figure to 30% by the end of June 2017. On the second management level, 38%
of managers were women at the end of 2015. Our goal is to at least maintain
this high level through the end of June 2017. On the basis of what we have
achieved in terms of gender diversity since 2012, these two new commit-
ments put Beiersdorf in a leading position among the companies governed
by the new federal law. One example of how we improved diversity by taking
specific measures: In 2015, we almost doubled the number of job-sharing
positions for women in leadership compared to the previous year.

39

© International diversity: Our already competitive international mobility policy
was further modified in 2015 to provide improved support to individual fam-
ilies as well as for re-integration after an assignment. Further, we increased
the number of international employees at Hamburg headquarters to 14% in
2015 (2014: 13%). The number of employees with several years of interna-
tional experience is far higher than revealed by nationality statistics alone. At
the most senior level of management, for example, more than half of the cur-
rent managers have experience of at least two foreign assignments lasting
several years.

© Generational dialog: To foster exchange among the various generations of
people working at Beiersdorf, we have established an initiative to enable our
apprentices to become “buddies” to senior employees in order to explore
such topics as IT and social media.

MOVE TO THE NEW TESA HEADQUARTERS

The company’s move to Norderstedt was a milestone for tesa in 2015. This took
place in three stages: The technology center was the first to move to the new
location, followed by headquarters and then the research center. We equipped
the new head office with modern workstations designed to encourage inter-
action among employees from different parts of the business. The move also
marked the start of the “It’s for you!” health program, which includes the tesa
sports club; a sports, fitness, and health area; and advice on ergonomics. Various
programs are also available in the area of healthy eating.

SUCCESSION PLANNING AND TALENT MANAGEMENT

Succession planning and talent management are core elements of our HR
strategy at tesa. They support us in filling as many management vacancies as
possible from within our company’s own ranks. In the reporting period, a dedi-
cated tesa competency model was developed that involved managers from all
regions. The first step was to apply the new model to feedback discussions
involving senior-level managers.

A MOTIVATING WORKING ENVIRONMENT

Employee surveys took place in North America, Asia, and Western Europe in
2015, creating a basis for continuous improvement of the working environment
as well as of employee commitment. The very positive results of the survey have
been spurring us on to make further enhancements. Surveys will take place in
the remaining regions from 2016 on and will be repeated at regular intervals in
the future.

INTERNATIONAL TRAINING

For many years, we have used a global training program to successfully prepare
all our sales and purchasing staff for their national and international responsibil-
ities. This approach is to be extended to the tesa Supply Network in the future.
As a result, the reporting period saw extensive work to develop the relevant
program. Our aim is to develop a shared understanding of how to smoothly
manage international sales projects.


--- Page 22 ---

NEW FOCUS ON VARIABLE REMUNERATION

We also agreed to the Compensation and Benefit Guideline in 2015 and began
to implement it internationally. The most important change concerns variable
remuneration, which is to move away from individual targets toward targets at
the company and team levels. With an increasing number of sales projects being
implemented by international teams, this is a more effective approach to
measuring and rewarding performance.

Risk

Integrated Risk and Opportunity Management

Entrepreneurial success cannot be achieved without consciously taking risks.
Risk management helps us to master the risks associated with the strategic
objectives of the business and to maximize our strategic potential. Regular
strategy reviews ensure that opportunities and risks are reasonably balanced.
We incur risks only if there is a corresponding opportunity for an appropriate in-
crease in value and if they can be managed using established methods and
measures within our organization. Relevant risks are identified and captured in
a structured manner. They are classified based on the estimated probability of
occurrence and the potential financial impact if they were to occur.

Report

Risk management is an integral part of central and local planning, management,
and control processes, and conforms to consistent standards across the Group.
Our open communications policy, the risk inventory carried out at regular inter-
vals, and the planning and management system ensure that our risk situation is
presented transparently. Risk management is coordinated at Group headquar-
ters. Our risk management structures and workflows are documented in a ded-
icated manual.

Accounting-related Internal Control System

An accounting-related internal control system is used to ensure the correctness
of the bookkeeping and accounting as well as the reliability of the financial re-
porting in the consolidated financial statements and the Group Management
Report. This integral element of the consolidated accounting process comprises
preventive, monitoring, and detective measures designed to ensure security
and control in accounting and the operational functions. The security measures
and controls reduce the probability of errors occurring and uncover any that are
made at an early stage. Among other things, the measures include the separa-
tion of functions, manual and IT-based approval processes using the dual con-
trol principle, IT checks, access restrictions and authorization concepts for the
IT system, and systems-based processes for handling Group accounting data.
Procedural instructions, standardized reporting formats, and IT-based report-
ing and consolidation processes support Group accounting and financial report-
ing for the companies included in the consolidated financial statements.

Shared service centers provide uniform processing of the core accounting pro-
cesses at Beiersdorf AG and most of its affiliates. The year of 2015 saw the
successful completion of a global roll-out project in relation to this. The basic

principles and processes and the reporting structure for Group accounting are
documented in an accounting and financial control manual. Legislation, ac-
counting standards, and pronouncements are analyzed for their relevance and
impact and taken into account as necessary.

Independent Monitoring

Our Internal Audit department - which serves as the Executive Board’s financial
control function - monitors risk management and the internal control system by
means of systematic and regular audits. The department is independent of the
Group’s operating activities and uses a risk-based approach to reviewing our
business processes and the systems and controls we have put in place. In
addition, the external auditors audit the risk early-warning and monitoring
system. Both the Internal Audit department and external auditors regularly
report their audit findings to the Supervisory Board and, in particular, to its
Audit Committee.

Our Risk Profile

STRATEGIC AND SECTOR-SPECIFIC RISKS

Maintaining and increasing the value of our major consumer brands with their
broad appeal is of central importance for Beiersdorf’s business development.
We have geared our risk management system towards protecting the value of
our brands. Our compliance with high standards of product quality and safety is
the basis for our consumers’ continued trust in our brands. We therefore per-
form in-depth safety assessments, which take into account consumer feedback
on earlier products, when developing new products. Our products are subject
to the strict criteria of our quality management system throughout the entire
procurement, production, and distribution process.

Innovations based on strong research and development are a precondition for
consumer acceptance of our products and for the latter’s appeal. Prudent brand
management captures consumer trends as well as the results of in-depth
market and competitive analyses, and at the same time ensures that the brand's
core remains intact and is carefully enhanced.

Strong brands that balance innovation and continuity are our response to fierce
global competition on price, quality, and innovation. We have laid the ground-
work for identifying consumer wishes and reflecting them in the products we
develop even faster by developing and implementing the Consumer Insights
process. Direct communication with consumers via digital social media is be-
coming an increasingly important aspect of this. These efforts also counteract
the growing retail concentration and the regional emergence of private label
products.

Since expertise-based brands require a high degree of upfront investment in
innovation and marketing, the continuous expansion of our trademark and
patent portfolio plays a key role. In particular, the systematic registration and
enforcement of our intellectual property rights prevents imitations and counter-
feiting of our products, and thus helps safeguard and further increase the earn-
ings potential previously created. Third-party intellectual property rights are
identified and respected when developing new products.

the same time, we ensure that we are generating the funds needed for this in the
long term.

SUPPLY CHAIN AND IT RISKS

We counter procurement risks relating to the availability and price of raw mate-
rials, merchandise, and services by continuously monitoring our markets and
suppliers and ensuring active management of our supplier portfolio as well as
by appropriate contract management. Procurement strategies are reviewed
regularly and adjusted to reflect internal and external requirements. We counter
compliance risks by providing clear management structures and through effi-
cient organizational measures. Occupational safety and environmental and
business interruption risks in our production and logistics activities are mini-
mized by process control checks and location-specific audits. We minimize risks
relating to the availability, reliability, and efficiency of our IT systems through
continuous monitoring and improvements as well as through the establishment
of a continuity management system that is an integrated part of our IT opera-
tions. We counter selected risks by transferring them to insurance companies.

Cooperation and contacts with universities enable us to build early links to qual-
ified new employees, for whom we have special trainee programs to prepare
them for a career at Beiersdorf. Our uniform global talent management process
identifies and develops talented specialists and management personnel at all
levels and supports the appointment of qualified staff in key positions through-
out the company as these become vacant.

FINANCIAL RISKS

We counter the risk of bad debts through detailed monitoring of our customer
relationships, active receivables management, and the selective use of trade
credit insurance.

Currency, interest rate, and liquidity risks are subject to active treasury manage-
ment based on global guidelines. They are managed and hedged centrally to
a very large extent, whereby the specific requirements for the organizational
separation of the trading, settlement, and controlling functions are taken into
account. Derivative financial instruments serve primarily to hedge operational
activities and financial transactions essential to the business. They do not
expose the Group to any additional material risks.

We limit currency risks from intragroup deliveries of goods and services using
currency forwards. Generally, 75% of forecasted annual net cash flows are
hedged (cash flow hedges on forecasted transactions). Currency risks from
cross-border intragroup financing are generally hedged in the market by the
central treasury department using currency forwards.

Potential default risks relating to the investment of the Group’s liquid funds are
limited by only making investments with defined, reliable counterparties. Coun-
terparty risk is monitored on the basis of ratings and the counterparties’ liable
capital as well as continuously updated risk indicators. These parameters are

41

used to determine maximum amounts for investments with partner banks and
securities issuers (counterparty limits), which are compared regularly with the
investments actually made throughout the Group. We have invested the major-
ity of our liquidity in low-risk investments (such as government/corporate
bonds and Pfandbriefe).

We use liquidity concentration methods and tools at our affiliates in order to
optimally manage our investments. Appropriate systems ensure we have trans-
parency concerning our affiliates’ remaining funds. Positive balances are regis-
tered with central counterparty risk management. Our financial risk manage-
ment is characterized by the clear allocation of responsibilities, central rules for
limiting financial risks as a matter of principle, and the conscious alignment of
the instruments deployed with the requirements of our business activities.

Further information on the extent of the currency, interest rate, default, and
liquidity risks described above can be found in Note 27 of the consolidated
financial statements, “Additional Disclosures on Financial Instruments, Financial
Risk Management, and Derivative Financial Instruments.”

LEGAL RISKS

Along with other international companies, the Beiersdorf Consumer Business
Segment’s Brazilian affiliates are involved in tax proceedings on a national level.
However, no conclusive assessment of the risk from the Group perspective is
possible at present.

External tax audits can result in additional tax payments at individual compa-
nies, potentially with financial penalties and interest payments.

Further information on the extent of the legal risks described above can be
found in Note 28 of the consolidated financial statements, “Contingent Liabili-
ties, Other Financial Obligations, and Legal Risks.”

OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE GROUP’S RISK SITUATION

Our assessment of the risk situation is the result of our examination of all mate-
rial individual risks listed above. There have been no structural changes in the
risk situation compared with the previous year. Based on our current assess-
ment, the Beiersdorf Group is not exposed to any risks that could endanger its
continued existence.

which contains the following concluding declaration: “According to the circum-
stances known to us at the time the transactions were executed or measures
were taken or not taken, Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft received appropriate
consideration for every transaction and has not been disadvantaged by the fact
that measures were taken or not taken.”

Report on Post-Balance
Sheet Date Events

Disclosures Required
by Takeover Law

The disclosures required under § 315 (4) Handelsgesetzbuch (German Commer-
cial Code, HGB) are presented below.

Please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the disclo-
sures on the composition of the subscribed capital and the disclosures on direct
or indirect interests in the share capital exceeding 10% of the voting rights. In
addition to this, Michael Herz, Germany, has informed the Executive Board that
further shares in Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft are attributable to him and that
he directly holds shares in Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft. In total, the share of
voting rights held by Michael Herz in Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft amounts to
60.99% (including 9.99% own shares held by Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft,
which do not bear voting or dividend rights).

The appointment and removal from office of members of the Executive Board
are governed by §§ 84 and 85 Aktiengesetz (German Stock Corporation Act,
AktG), § 31 Mitbestimmungsgesetz (German Co-Determination Act, MitbestG),
and § 7 of the Articles of Association. In accordance with § 7 of the Articles of
Association, the Executive Board consists of at least three persons; apart from
this provision, the Supervisory Board determines the number of members of the
Executive Board. The Articles of Association may be amended in accordance
with $§ 179 and 133 AktG and with § 16 of the Articles of Association. Under § 16
of the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve
amendments and additions to the Articles of Association that concern the lat-
ter’s wording only. Under § 5 (6) of the Articles of Association, the Supervisory
Board is authorized in particular to amend and reformulate § 5 of the Articles of
Association (Share Capital) following each utilization of authorized or contin-
gent capital.

The Annual General Meeting on March 31, 2015, authorized the Executive Board,
with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital in the
period until March 30, 2020, by up to a total of €92 million (Authorized Capital
|: €42 million; Authorized Capital II: €25 million; Authorized Capital III: €25 mil-
lion) by issuing new no-par-value bearer shares on one or several occasions. In
this context, the dividend rights for new shares may be determined by a differ-
ent method than that set out in § 60 (2) AktG.

Shareholders shall be granted preemptive rights. However, the Executive Board
is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to disapply share-
holders’ preemptive rights in the following cases:

1. to eliminate fractions created as a result of capital increases against cash
contributions (Authorized Capital |, II, II!);

2. to the extent necessary to grant the holders/creditors of convertible bonds
or bonds with warrants issued by Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft, or companies
in which it holds a direct or indirect majority interest, rights to subscribe for
new shares in the amount to which they would be entitled after exercising
their conversion or option rights, or after fulfilling their conversion obligation
(Authorized Capital |, II, Ill);

3. if the total amount of share capital attributable to the new shares for which
preemptive rights are to be disapplied does not exceed 10% of the share cap-
ital existing at the time this authorization comes into effect or, in the event
that this amount is lower, at the time the new shares are issued and the issue
price of the new shares is not materially lower than the quoted market price
of the existing listed shares at the time when the issue price is finalized, which
should be as near as possible to the time the shares are placed. If, during the
term of the authorized capital, other authorizations to issue or sell shares in
the company or to issue rights that enable or oblige the holder to subscribe
for shares in the company are exercised while disapplying preemptive rights
pursuant to or in accordance with § 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG, this must be
counted toward the above-mentioned 10% limit (Authorized Capital I!);

4. in the case of capital increases against non-cash contributions for the pur-
pose of acquiring companies, business units of companies, or equity interests
in companies (Authorized Capital III).

The Executive Board was also authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory
Board, to determine the further details of the capital increase and its implemen-
tation.

In addition, the Annual General Meeting on March 31, 2015, resolved to contin-
gently increase the share capital by up to a total of €42 million, composed of up
to 42 million no-par value bearer shares. The contingent capital increase will be
implemented only to the extent that:

1. the holders or creditors of conversion and/or option rights attached to con-
vertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants issued in the period until March
30, 2020, by Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft, or companies in which it holds a
direct or indirect majority interest, choose to exercise their conversion or
option rights, or

2. the holders or creditors of convertible bonds giving rise to a conversion obli-
gation issued in the period until March 30, 2020, by Beiersdorf Aktienge-
sellschaft, or companies in which it holds a direct or indirect majority interest,
comply with such obligation,

and the contingent capital is required for this in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the bonds.

The new shares bear dividend rights from the beginning of the fiscal year in
which they are created as a result of the exercise of conversion or option rights,
or as a result of compliance with a conversion obligation.

The Executive Board was authorized to determine the further details of the
implementation of a contingent capital increase.

The Annual General Meeting on March 31, 2015, also authorized the company in
accordance with § 71 (1) no. 8 AktG to purchase own shares in the total amount
of up to 10% of the existing share capital in the period up to March 30, 2020. The
shares shall be purchased via the stock exchange or via a public purchase offer
addressed to all shareholders, or a public invitation to tender shares. The Annual
General Meeting authorized the Executive Board, with the approval of the
Supervisory Board, to sell in whole or in part the own shares purchased on the
basis of the above-mentioned or a prior authorization while disapplying the
shareholders’ preemptive rights, including in a way other than via the stock
exchange or via a purchase offer to all shareholders, to the extent that these
shares are sold for cash at a price that does not fall materially below the market
price of the same class of shares of the company at the time of the sale. The
Executive Board was also authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory
Board, to sell in whole or in part the own shares acquired in accordance with the
above-mentioned or a previous authorization against non-cash consideration
while disapplying the preemptive rights of shareholders, particularly to utilize
them as consideration or partial consideration in the context of a merger or the
acquisition of companies, equity interests in companies (including increases in
equity interests), or business units of companies. Moreover, the Executive Board
is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to utilize these own
shares in whole or in part, while disapplying the preemptive rights of sharehold-
ers, in order to satisfy the subscription and/or conversion rights from converti-
ble bonds and/or bonds with warrants issued by the company or companies in
which it holds a direct or indirect majority interest. The Executive Board is fur-
ther authorized, in the event that own shares are sold to all shareholders, to dis-
apply the preemptive rights of shareholders where this is necessary to eliminate
any fractions that may arise. The Executive Board may only make use of the
above authorizations to disapply preemptive rights when utilizing own shares to
the extent that the total proportion of shares utilized without preemptive rights
does not exceed 20% of the share capital either at the time of the resolution by
the Annual General Meeting or at the time these authorizations are exercised. If,
during the term of this authorization to utilize own shares, other authorizations
to issue or sell shares in the company or to issue rights that enable or oblige the
holder to acquire shares in the company are exercised while disapplying
preemptive rights, this must be counted toward the above-mentioned limit. Fi-
nally, the Executive Board was authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory
Board, to retire the own shares acquired in accordance with the above-
mentioned or a prior authorization without requiring an additional resolution by
the Annual General Meeting.

The creation of the authorized and contingent capital is intended to put the
company in the position of being able to react to growth opportunities and
capital market situations quickly and flexibly. The authorization to purchase and
utilize own shares enables the company in particular to also offer shares of the
company to institutional or other investors and/or to expand the shareholder
base of the company, as well as to utilize the purchased own shares as consider-
ation for the acquisition of companies or equity interests in companies (includ-
ing increases in equity interests), or as part of a merger, i.e. against non-cash
consideration.

Report on Expected
Develooments

Expected Macroeconomic Developments

The global economic situation seems on the verge of seeing only moderate
improvement in 2016. On the whole, we expect performance to vary greatly.
While the industrial countries will benefit from expansive monetary policies and
reduced energy prices, we anticipate a slowdown in momentum in the emerg-
ing markets. The debt situation in the emerging markets will be negatively im-
pacted by the US Federal Reserve's hike in the key interest rate, the continued
rise of the US dollar, and low oil prices. In terms of global economic growth, geo-
political unrest coupled with the unclear economic trend in China are causing
substantial uncertainty.

In the eurozone, we expect growth in 2016 to be up slightly on the prior year on
the back of expansionary monetary policies, low oil prices, and the relatively
weak euro. Factors that could put the recovery at risk include ongoing high
unemployment in many countries, a lack of appetite for reform in combination
with high debt levels in certain European countries, and geopolitical unrest. We
anticipate a relatively mixed trend overall, with growth remaining modest due
to the still weak economy in some countries.

In Germany, we expect growth to outstrip that of the rest of Europe. The stable
employment market, low interest rates, and the low price of oil will positively
impact consumer spending.

In the United States, we expect the economy to grow in 2016. Consumer
spending is set to rise as a result of the further decline in unemployment. The
increased confidence of American companies and the favorable economic
environment are likely to be reflected in an increase in capital expenditure.
However, tapering of bond sales and the planned increase in interest rates are a
source of uncertainty for the economy and the financial markets.

In Japan, we expect growth to be slightly higher than in the previous year due
to increases in wage levels and higher consumer spending. Factors that could
hold back growth include weak export demand and scheduled fiscal reforms.

In the growth markets, we continue to anticipate difficult conditions and a cool-
ing off of the economy. In China, we expect growth to be down on the prior-year
level. Fiscal policy and the uncertain effects of the social and environmental re-
forms that have been announced are particular sources of uncertainty. In India,
we expect to see slightly higher growth than in the previous year, with continued
high single-digit inflation. We likewise anticipate a slight growth increase in the

emerging markets of Southeast Asia. In Brazil, we expect the recession to con-
tinue in 2016 as a result of political uncertainty, a lack of investor confidence,
necessary budget reforms, and restrictive fiscal policies aimed at combating in-
flation. Given the highly protectionist tendencies in many Latin American coun-
tries, particularly in Venezuela, Ecuador, and Argentina, developments are diffi-
cult to forecast for this area. The Russian economy is being negatively impacted
by the fall in oil prices, the depreciation of the ruble, and the consequences of
continuing international sanctions. In light of the above factors and a lack of
structural reforms, forecasts expect the recession to ease only slightly.

Procurement Market Trends

Commodity markets are expected to remain weak in 2016, with low oil prices
persisting and weak demand from China and other regions limiting inflationary
pressure in the core material industries that feed Beiersdorf’s suppliers of raw
and packaging materials. In addition, Beiersdorf has established a strong pro-
gram of sourcing cost reduction. The combination of these two effects is ex-
pected to lead to further overall reductions in material prices in 2016.

Sales Market Trends

We believe that the global growth rate in the cosmetics market - the market rel-
evant for Beiersdorf - will rise only minimally above the prior-year level in 2016.
We continue to expect low but stable growth in the major European and North
American markets. The emerging markets will make a positive contribution to
overall performance, although momentum is likely to continue easing year-on-
year.

As in the previous year, geopolitical risks and their impact on the macro-
economic trend will impact tesa’s long-term business in 2016. However, stable
growth is projected for Europe overall, although the Ukraine conflict and the cri-
sis in Greece may continue to have negative effects on the markets. By contrast,
we expect North America to gain significant momentum from the automotive
industry in particular. Moreover, we assess the trend in Latin America as posi-
tive. Brazil represents an element of uncertainty due to its sustained economic
crisis. Our expectations for Asia are highly dependent on the performance of
the Chinese economy. For 2016, tesa anticipates moderate growth in Asia,
primarily in the automotive segment.

Our Market Opportunities

Market performance will remain mixed in 2016 and competition will continue to
increase in some markets. The business strategy set out in the Blue Agenda will
allow us to meet the challenges of tomorrow and hence to achieve our objec-
tives. We see strong opportunities both in systematically expanding our pres-
ence in the emerging markets and in consolidating our position in our European
markets. We aim to drive this process by strengthening our brands - especially
NIVEA, Eucerin, and La Prairie - and boosting our innovation power. This analysis
underpins our planning for 2016.

We will build on our sound financial structure and strong earnings position to-
gether with our dedicated and highly qualified employees to continue exploit-
ing future opportunities with our internationally successful brand portfolio. Ex-
tensive research and development activities resulting in successful, consumer-
driven innovations will be flanked by targeted marketing measures, strength-
ening our brand core and creating enduring confidence among our consumers.

tesa’s electronics industry business in the Asian region continues to appear
attractive. However, only slight growth is projected for that customer segment
due to increased competition. The automotive area will maintain its status as an
important growth market for global customers. Strategically, we are focusing in
particular on developing and expanding high-margin business lines in techno-
logically challenging areas of application. The pharmaceuticals industry contin-
ues to represent a new, forward-looking business segment for tesa.

Business Developments
Our assessment of business developments in the coming year is based on the
above assumptions.

In light of the macroeconomic forecasts, Beiersdorf is expecting sales growth in
the Consumer Business Segment to outperform the market at 3-4% in fiscal
year 2016. The EBIT margin from operations is expected to slightly exceed the
prior-year figure.

In the tesa Business Segment, we are predicting sales growth of 2-4% for 2016.
The EBIT margin from operations is expected to be similar to the prior-year level.

Building on the forecasts for the two business segments, we are expecting
Group sales to grow by 3-4%. The consolidated EBIT margin from operations
should slightly exceed the prior-year figure.

We firmly believe we are well positioned for the future thanks to our internation-
ally successful brand portfolio, our innovative and high-quality products, and

our dedicated employees.
