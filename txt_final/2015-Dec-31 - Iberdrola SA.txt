This management report has been prepared taking into consideration the "Guide of
recommendations for the development of management reports of listed companies", published
by the CNMV in July 2013.

1. COMPANY’S STANDING

IBERDROLA has undergone a wide-ranging transformation over the last ten years which has
enabled it to advance through the ranks to become the number one Spanish energy group, one
of the Spanish main companies in the Ibex 35 by market capitalization, the world leader in wind
energy, and one of the world's top power companies.

Our work has led us to an international reference position, becoming one of the leading
operators in the United Kingdom, one of the most important electrical companies in the United
States of America, the largest private generator of Mexico and has strengthened its leadership
as an electricity supplier by number of customers in Brazil.

Strategic Projection

This positive evolution has been made possible thanks to a strategic vision that has enabled
IBERDROLA to anticipate the needs of the energy sector throughout three stages:

e 2001-2006: planning over these years was focused on energy business growth
principally in Spain and Latin America, with the company succeeding in doubling its size
and profits by the end of the period. Installed capacity rose from 16,500 to 30,500 MW
while net earnings came to EUR 1,660 million in 2006.

e 2007-2013: the strategy was marked by strong international expansion and
consolidation. During this period, IBERDROLA carried out the integration of the Scottish
company Scottish Power, the North American company Energy East (called Iberdrola
USA until 16 December 2015, date in which the friendly integration with UIL Holdings
Corporation was consumed, resulting in a new company, AVANGRID, and the Brazilian
ELEKTRO, as well as the expansion of its activities in renewable energy.

e 2014-2016: IBERDROLA has continued making great efforts to optimize the Group’s
operational and financial management in order to keep advancing with respect to
meeting the targets set in Forecast 2014-2016. The company will continue developing
its sustainable business and long term model through its investment programme which
amounts to EUR 11,200 million, allocated mainly to areas of power transmission and
distribution (T&D) and renewable energy in their reference markets.

AVANGRID, one of the largest electricity utilities in the United States

Notable features of this third stage include Iberdrola USA's obtaining all necessary approvals to
seal its friendly merger with UIL Holdings Corporation. Completion of the merger on 16
December 2015 gave rise to the new company AVANGRID. The Company, which boasts
assets worth in excess of USD 35,000 million, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on
17 December. The new company is one of the largest electricity utilities in the U.S.
consolidating its position as the second largest wind energy operator, as the company has
presence in 25 States. By its nature as a listed subholding it has full independence and
strengthened autonomy.

1.1. Governance system

IBERDROLA and the companies belonging to the Group are committed to a mission, vision and
values, approved by the Board of Directors.

The Group's mission is to create value in a sustainable way in the development of its activities
for the society, citizens, customers and shareholders, being the leading multinational group in
the energy sector providing quality service by using energy sources that respect the
environment, innovating and considering its employees a strategic asset, encouraging their
development, training and conciliation measures, favouring a good working environment and
equal opportunities, committed to social return throughout its business, generating employment
and wealth in their environment and all of these, going together with its strategy of social
responsibility and compliance of tax rules.

This mission goes hand in hand with a vision based on the ambition to lead a better future,
creating sustainable value with a top-quality service for people and communities in which the
Group operates, incorporating twelve values: the creation of sustainable value, ethical
principles, good corporate governance and transparency, development of the Group's human
resources, social commitment, a sense of belonging, safety and reliability, quality, innovation,
protection of the environment, a focus on the customer and institutional loyalty.

The Group's mission, vision and values inspire the contents of the Corporate governance
system, a set of internal regulations which, in accordance with current legislation and utilising
the corporate autonomy permitted by this legislation, furthers the Company's corporate purpose
at the head of a multinational energy leader operating across a range of social and economic
contexts, satisfaction of social interests, understood as the common interests of all the
shareholders of an independent company determined to carry out its corporate purpose in a
sustainable fashion and create long-term value, with a wide-ranging non-controlling and
institutional shareholding structure.

The corporate governance system is based on the following principles:
1. Involvement of shareholders

IBERDROLA believes it is vital to involve shareholders in corporate affairs, and it therefore
operates a policy to involve them, establishing mechanisms and guarantees to this end.

2. Consideration of the legitimate interests of other stakeholders

IBERDROLA and the Group pursue the corporate purpose in due consideration of the other
legitimate public and private interests forming part of their business activity and institutional
reality, especially those of the different communities and regions in which they operate,
those of their employees, and of other Group stakeholders. To this end, IBERDROLA has a
Policy of relations with stakeholders, the purpose of which is to implement a relations
framework to make stakeholders part of the Group's business and activities through an
effective coordination mechanism.

3. Balanced and diverse composition of the Board of Directors

The composition of the IBERDROLA Board of Directors was devised to best suit the
requirements of the various areas of business and markets in which the Group operates.
Renewal of the Board is scaled, and the objective is that each year the appointment or re-
election of approximately one quarter of Board members is submitted to a vote at the
General Shareholders' Meeting.

186

4. A corporate and governance structure combining decentralised management with
proper Group coordination

The corporate structure encompasses the Company (IBERDROLA, S.A.), subholding
companies and business parent companies.

IBERDROLA, which performs exclusively the function of the parent company, is the
company holding the stake of the subholding companies. Such entities group together
equity stakes in the energy head of business companies carrying out their activities within
the various countries in which the Group operates. This structure is rounded out with a
country subholding company that groups together certain equity interests in other entities,
including the non-energy head of business companies. One of the main functions of the
subholding companies is the centralization of the common services provided to one
another, always in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law.

This corporate structure has been successfully deployed in Spain, Mexico, Brazil and the
UK, and produces a rapid streamlined process for ordinary management decisions to be
taken by business parents, and introduces proper Group coordination, in exercise of the
supervisory functions of subholding companies and IBERDROLA.

In the United States of America, the Company holds a majority stake in the subholding
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Avangrid, Inc. For this company the
Corporate governance system contemplates a special system of greater autonomy to
properly protect the interests of non-controlling shareholders, boosting vigilance of
operations in connection with other Group companies, and this gives it a greater measure of
independence to coordinate its investees and run businesses.

1.2 Scope of activities, sectors and geographical areas

Since 2011, the IBERDROLA Group's economic-financial and operational information has been
grouped in the following lines of business: Network business, Generation and Retail
businesses, Renewables business, and other businesses. The Corporation includes the costs of
the Group's structure (Single Corporation), of the administration services of the corporate areas
that are subsequently invoiced to the other companies through specific service agreements.

Given the nature of the activities carried out by the IBERDROLA Group, its organization
responds to the strategic business units, rather than product and service lines. These
businesses are managed independently, as they respond to different technologies, regulations,
and geographic markets (Note 7).

The IBERDROLA Group has a decentralised structure and management model to approximate
the decision taking to places where they should have effect, through the subholding companies
and parent companies of the businesses. In addition, the independence and listed subholding
companies’ reinforced autonomy are guaranteed.

187

Simplified diagram of the Group’s corporate structure

The corporate structure comprises the Company, country subholding companies, and business
subholding companies.

The Company, which performs exclusively the functions of the parent company, is the entity that
holds the equity stakes in the country subholding companies. Each country subholding
company, in turn, groups together the business subholding companies that conduct their
activities in each country in which the Group operates. The Group also has a subholding
company that meets certain interests in other entities, including leading companies of non-
energy businesses. Its main function consists on centralizing the common service providing to
such companies, always in accordance with the provisions of applicable law.

This corporate structure has been successfully deployed in Spain, Mexico, Brazil and the UK,
and produces a rapid streamlined process for ordinary management decisions to be taken by
business parents, and introduces proper Group coordination, in exercise of the supervisory
functions of subholding companies and IBERDROLA.

In the United States of America, the Company holds a majority stake in the subholding company
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Avangrid, Inc. For this company the corporate
governance system contemplates a special system of greater autonomy to properly protect the
interests of non-controlling shareholders, boosting vigilance of operations in connection with
other Group companies, and this gives it a greater measure of independence to coordinate its
investees and run businesses.

The Company's and the Group’s governance conforms to the structure described above:
separates the duties relating to strategy, oversight, and control of the Group as a whole, the
duties of organisation and coordination of the businesses in each country and the multinational
no-energetic business, as well as those of day-to-day administration and effective management
of each business.

.3 Governance system

1

The Company's and the Group’s governance conforms to the structure described above:
separates the duties relating to strategy, oversight, and control of the Group as a whole, the
duties of organisation and coordination of the businesses in each country and the multinational
no-energetic business, as well as those of day-to-day administration and effective management
of each business.

It is established on the following bases:

a) The Board of Directors of the Company, which exclusively exercises holding company
duties, has assigned powers relating to the establishment of the Group’s policies and
strategies and of the basic guidelines for the management thereof, as well as general
oversight of the development of such policies, strategies and guidelines and of
decisions on matters that are strategically significant at the Group level.

b) The chairman of the Board of Directors & chief executive officer of the Company, with
the technical support of the Operating Committee, the Group’s Business CEO and the
rest of the management team, assumes the duty of organisation and strategic
coordination of the Group through the dissemination, implementation and monitoring of
the overall strategy and of the basic management guidelines established by the Board
of Directors.

c) This organisation and coordination duty is strengthened through the boards of directors
of country subholding companies, which includes independent directors, and their own
audit committees, internal audit areas, and compliance units or divisions.

d) The business subholding companies of the Group assume decentralised executive
responsibilities. They carry out the day-to-day administration and effective management
of each of the businesses, and are responsible for the day-to-day control thereof. These
business subholding companies are organised through their respective boards of
directors and their own decision-making bodies.

The corporate and governance structure of the Group described above operates jointly with the
Group’s Business Model, which entails the global integration of the businesses and aims to
maximise the operational efficiency of the different units. The Business Model ensures the
dissemination, implementation and monitoring of the overall strategy and of the basic
management guidelines established for each business, primarily through the exchange of best
practices among the various companies of the Group, without detracting from their
independence in decision-making.

In any case, the Company and the Group assume the commitments established by law in
connection with the legal and functional separation of the companies carrying out regulated
activities, while the country subholding companies ensure compliance with the law on this
matter.

control functions and the policy followed with minority interests.

A comprehensive description of the governance structure of the Company, functions and
internal regulations of the committees can be seen in Appendix C of the Annual Corporate
Governance Report, which forms part of this Management Report.

1.5 Vision and values

IBERDROLA works to be an energy company committed to ethics and respect for the
environment as the foundation for a sense of belonging and for the trust of all persons and its

+ Respect for the environment.

+ Sense of belonging and trust.

+ Safety and reliability.

+ Customer focus.

1.6 Business model

The business model defined in the IBERDROLA Group aims to supply reliable power of quality
and environmentally respectful, throughout a long term sustainable industrial project.

The model is based on three pillars: a framework of trust based on an advanced corporate
governance model; the vision and values of the Group approved by its management; and the
differential elements that make IBERDROLA a different company:

e Focus in regulated businesses.

e — International diversification.

e Clean and competitive energy commitment.

e Operational efficiency.

e Strength of the group.

e Global team committed and qualified.

outsource other estimated to be developed more efficiently by other specialized companies,
which IBERDROLA requires certain quality standards and responsible behaviour in
environmental, social and labour fields.

This information can be extended with corresponding indicators described in the Sustainability
Report.

1.9 Strategic principles for the 2016-2020 period

IBERDROLA's outlook for 2016-2020 implements the company's sustainable business model,
focusing on growth of regulated business and clean energies: geographic diversification in
countries with high credit ratings; higher operating efficiency; financial solvency to take up
growth opportunities in the markets in which it operates; higher returns to shareholders and a
firm social commitment seeking to create value for all stakeholders.

IBERDROLA is undertaking a new era of investment and growth during which it expects to
boost both the Group's EBITDA and net profits by an annual average of 6% between 2016 and
2020.

The Company's strategy will therefore focus chiefly on investment in high-quality assets in its
main markets, operating efficiency, financial solvency and sustainability of its dividend.

191


--- Page 8 ---

Investment

The strategic basis presented by IBERDROLA in respect of 2016-2020 establishes a net
investment programme of EUR 24,000 million in its main geographic and business areas, EUR
17,000 million of which are accounted for by investment focusing on growth. The company has
now allocated almost EUR 22,000 million of its total investment to projects that are already
ongoing or have been confirmed.

88% of the investment scheduled over the next five years will target regulated business or long-
term contracts, mostly networks and renewable energies, providing the security, stability and
visibility that characterise the Group's business model and will generate 81% of Group EBITDA
by 2020.

The Group will focus primarily on two areas of business: electricity transmission and distribution
networks, to which IBERDROLA will allocate 46% of total investments and, to a lesser extent,
renewable energies, to which it will allocate 33% of the total amount forecast. 12% of total
investment will be earmarked for generation and commercial business, and 9% of the remainder
to regulated generation.

Main projects

- United Kingdom: IBERDROLA will continue to implement network infrastructures under
the regulatory frameworks already approved for transmission and distribution (RIIO-T1
and RIIO-ED1). With respect to renewable energy projects in the UK, the company is
building six new land-based wind plants with a combined power output of 450 MW, and is
continuing its East of Anglia project in the North Sea which, along with the Wikinger
offshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea (Germany), will add 1,100 MW to IBERDROLA's
offshore installed power output.

- United States: Through AVANGRID, the Group will continue to invest in regulated
business in the states of New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and hopes
to add new transmission projects to the portfolio. IBERDROLA is also building four wind
power plants in the US with a combined power output of 750 MW.

- Mexico: IBERDROLA's investment packages will focus on regulated generation and
renewable energies, on the strength of the energy reform introduced in this country. The
Company is building three combined-cycle plants and three cogeneration plants on long-
term contracts, with a combined power output of 1,600 MW, and has plans for further
investment in renewable energies in the years ahead.

- Spain: investment will focus on networks, where the distribution regulatory framework has
been approved up to 2019.

- Portugal: the company has begun work on construction of a 1,200 MW hydroelectric
storage facility at the River Tamega, which should be up and running by 2023.

- Brazil: IBERDROLA is building seven wind plants with a combined power output of 180
MW, and is also involved in hydroelectric projects such as Belo Monte and Baixo Iguacu
along with NEOENERGIA. In terms of networks, tariff frameworks have been approved
for ELEKTRO (up to 2019), CELPE (up to 2017), COELBA and COSERN (up to 2018).

Operating efficiency
IBERDROLA, one of Europe's most efficient major electricity companies, will continue to boost

its operating efficiency on the strength of technical progress in terms of the automation and
digitalisation of all its businesses and processes.

192


--- Page 9 ---

Financial solvency

The Company will continue to hold a solid financial position that will enable it to take up growth
opportunities in its markets and continue to improve its solvency ratios. Thus it intends to
maintain operating cash flows above the levels of investment in all businesses.

Shareholder remuneration

The trend forecast for the period will enable the company to increase long-term remuneration
for shareholders, in keeping with results, with a payout in the region of 65-75%. IBERDROLA
intends to maintain the scrip dividend formula used in recent years, and the current number of
shares - around 6,240 million - is kept steady through repurchase operations.

2. BUSINESS EVOLUTION AND RESULTS

2.1. Operating highlights for the period

IBERDROLA’s results in the period must be framed within the company strategy, which is
defined by the growing weight of regulated activities (transmission and distribution) and the
renewable business, both in the selection of investment opportunities and in the contribution to
the Group’s profits. Furthermore, fiscal year 2015 was positively affected by the appreciation of
two of IBERDROLA’s reference currencies, the US dollar and the Sterling pound, an effect
partially offset by the depreciation of the Brazilian real.

In this respect, it is worth noting the following:

e In Spain, the period was characterized by a lower hydraulicity compared to the same
period last year (-27.6%), as 2014 was a year in which extraordinary rainfall occurred,
as well as an increase in the electric demand by 1.8%, and 1.6% in adjusted terms of
working days and temperature. In this sense, we emphasize the evolution of the
industrial sector of large consumers that grew 2.4% in the last 12 months.

e In the United Kingdom, the electricity demand dropped by 1.2% compared to 2014,
whereas the gas demand (which does not include the generation consumption)
increased by 2.2%, due to the low temperatures registered the first months of the year.

e« IBERDROLA’s operational area on the United States saw a 0.1% increase in electricity
demand and a 5.7% in gas demand, as a result of the high temperatures registered in
2015.

e As for Brazil, the rate of growth of demand dropped by 1.6% compared to the same
period of the previous year. Thus, ELEKTRO’s demand decreases by 4.4%, while
NEOENERGIA’s demand increases by 2.0%.

During financial year 2015, international markets of raw materials evolved as follows:

e The average price of Brent oil was USD 52.8 per barrel compared to USD 99.1 per
barrel for the previous year (-47%).

The average price of gas (TTF) over the period rose to EUR 19.8 per MWh compared to
EUR 20.9 per MWh in 2014 (-5%).

e The average price of API2 coal was USD 55.9 per MT compared to USD 75 per MT
-25%) for the previous year.

e The average cost of CO, allowances dropped from EUR 7.7 per MT in 2014 to EUR 6.0
per MT in 2015 (-22%).

During 2015, the average evolution of IBERDROLA’s main currencies compared to the Euro
was as follows: the Sterling pound revaluated by 10.0% while the US dollar and the Brazilian
real devalued by 16.5% and 18.3%, respectively.

In this context, IBERDROLA Group’s total production in this period decreased by 1.6% to
130,594 GWh (132,726 GWh in 2014). The Net Production by geographical areas is the
following:

194


--- Page 11 ---

Net Production (GWh) 2015 2014 % Change

Spain 54,453 59,413 -8.3
United Kingdom 18,448 18,720 -1.5
United States 17,015 17,157 -0.8

Brazil 441 344 28.2
Rest of the world 1,371 1,247 9.9
Total 130,594 132,726 1.6

At the end of 2015, IBERDROLA had 44,574 MW installed generation capacity, of which 62%
produces emission-free energy while operating at a very low variable cost. In the table below
distribution classified by countries and technologies is shown:

Countries 2015 2014 MW change (15-14)

Wind power, mini-hydraulic and other
renewables 14,186 14,050 136
Total power (MW) 44,574 43,468 1,106

The following exceptional highlights should be noted with regard to the period analysed,
compared with the previous fiscal year:

e The merge of IBERDROLA USA and the US company UIL, and its subsequent
establishment as AVANGRID has been effective since last 16 December 2015. As a
result, the Consolidated financial statements of the IBERDROLA Group include, at the
year end, the following events of impact:

- Profit and loss account: Lower EBITDA by EUR 60 million and Net Profit by EUR 45
million resulting from the inclusion of operating expenses as well as of the costs
generated by the regulatory conditions established by the regulatory Authorities of
the States of Connecticut and Massachusetts.

- Balance sheet: The incremental debt originating from UIL (now integrated in
AVANGRID) amounts to EUR 2,406 million, including the cash payment to UIL
shareholders.

e In the Spanish network business, there was a reversal of tax provisions with a positive
impact which brought EUR 220 million less corporate tax expenditure.

195


--- Page 12 ---

e The business in the United Kingdom has been negatively affected by the planned
closure of the Longannet Coal Power Station for the end of the first quarter of 2016,
whose impact increases the provisions item for the year 2015 by EUR 230 million after
tax.

e¢ Tax reduction in the United Kingdom (down to 18% in 2020), reflect positive results of
EUR 170 million.

e The evolution of Renewables USA was affected by the low wind energy resource of the
year, resulting from adverse weather conditions.

The optimisation of financial soundness and liquidity as strategic priorities are summarized as
follows:

e Net Debt was EUR 28,067 million, with the leverage ratio increasing to 40.7%
compared to 41.8% recorded in 2014. Excluding the impact of UIL’s integration, Net
Debt would reach EUR 25,661 million, with the leverage at 40.1%.

« The funds generated from operations in 2015 grew by 8.2% to EUR 5,907 million.

e Solvency ratios already reached the level expected for the end of 2016, with the target
having been achieved a year in advance.

2.2 Business evolution

United States 1,698 1,498 13.4
Brazil 392 460 -14.8
Total Network business 5,514 5,241 5.2

The Networks Business increased by 5.2% compared to 2014, reaching EUR 5,514 million, and
showed positive trends in all countries. The most significant events of the year were the

following:

In Spain it reached EUR 1,952 million as a result of the application of RDL 9/2013 and
despite the negative impact of EUR 40 million, the accrual of investments from previous
years having been accounted for in 2014.

The figure for the United Kingdom reached EUR 1,472 million (+10.6%) due to the
Sterling pound appreciation (+10%). The greater base of assets to remunerate from the
investments made and derived from applying the RIIO-T1 in Transmission, offset by the
income profile defined in the new regulatory framework for Distribution RIIO-ED1, which
will be in force from April 2015 to 2023.

The contribution of Iberdrola USA for this period is EUR 1,698 million (+13.4%) with the
appreciation of the US dollar.

The Gross Margin for Brazil totalled EUR 392 million (-14.8%), affected by the
depreciation of the Real and for an extraordinary profit accounted for in 2014, which is
partially offset by the increase in ELEKTRO’s tariffs (+38%) and affects the year-by-
year comparison.

e Deregulated Business

The Deregulated Business (Generation and Retail) increased by 2.3% to EUR 4,841 million
(EUR 4,733 million in 2014).

In Spain the figure reached EUR 2,971 million (-3.2%) despite the greater volume of
energy sold, and mainly due to the greater procurement costs resulting from the
different generation mix, a result of the drop in hydroelectric production (-30.3%) given
the extraordinary hydraulic conditions of the previous year. Additionally, in March 2014,
an extraordinary positive impact of EUR 43 million was registered in the gas business
due to the renegotiation of contracts, which affects the year-on-year comparison.
However, this effect was partially offset by the good performance of net operating
expenses.

The Gross Margin for the United Kingdom was EUR 1,306 million, positively affected by
the appreciation of the Sterling pound. The generation business decreased its
contribution due to the lower production (-1.5%) and the increase in costs (carbon tax).
The commercial business improved due to the greater sales, which compensate the
drop in tariffs and the increase of regulated costs (ROCs, DuOS and TuOS). It is
noteworthy the good performance of the gas business in this period.

Mexico contributed EUR 584 million to the Gross Margin (+27.8%) resulting from the
new contracts with private clients and the appreciation of the US dollar.

« Renewables business

The Renewable business increased its Gross Margin by 16.1% to EUR 2,361 million (EUR
2,034 million in 2014).

Mexico and Brazil 93 93 0.0
Rest of the world 123 108 13.9
Total Renewable business 2,361 2,034 16.1

The main causes of this trend are:

A lower production in Spain (-9.9%) offset by a recovery of prices (EUR +8, +14%),
given that they were exceptionally low in 2014 due to the weather conditions and the
impact of a regulatory reform during the first part of the year, means that the gross
margin rose to EUR 751 million (+3.2%).

An improved Gross Margin in the United Kingdom of EUR 572 million, due to the entry
of new capacity (contribution of the offshore wind farm of at West of Duddon Sands)
and the good wind conditions (production: +19.3%).

198


--- Page 15 ---

-  Agreater contribution from the US of EUR 822 million (+11.7%), due to the effect of the
exchange rate, which offsets a lower wind power resource (production: -4.1%) and
lower sale prices reached as a result of milder weather conditions than the previous
year.

-  Acontribution from Latin America and the Rest of the World of EUR 216 million, the
result of greater production and an improvement of wind power.

« Other businesses

The contribution of Other Businesses reached EUR 235 million, a 8.8% decrease (EUR 216
million in 2014).

2.2.1.2 Gross Operating result - EBITDA
Consolidated EBITDA increased by 4.9% up to EUR 7,306 million (EUR 6,965 million in 2014),

where all businesses improved, with increases in Networks (+1.9%), Renewables (+18.6%) and
Generation and Retail (+1.2%).

e Net operating expenses

n addition to the already explained Gross Margin, Net Operating Expenses increased by 5.4%
to EUR 3,830 million (EUR 3,634 million in 2014), affected by the exchange rate, given that
excluding this effect, it would have dropped by 1.6%. This item was affected by non-recurrent
positive impacts (favourable decisions accounted in “External Services” heading), offset by
higher non-recurrent costs related to the implementation of new IT systems in the United
Kingdom and the increase in expenses generated from AVANGRID’s operation.

e =©Levies

The Levies heading increased by 7.9% to EUR 1,706 million, mainly due to the positive impact
of EUR 113 million recorded in 2014 due to the favourable decision regarding CO, rights
deduction, which affects the year-on-year comparison, although it is partially offset by several
positive legal decisions (EUR 48 million). Additionally, the Levies heading increased due to the
impact of the exchange rate (EUR 85 million).

2.2.1.3. Net Operating result - EBIT

EBIT totalled EUR 3,829 million, a 2.8% decrease in comparison with 2014 (EUR 3,941 million).

EBIT 3,829 3,941 2.8

e Amortisations and provisions
Amortisations and Provisions increased by 15%, totalling EUR 3,477 million:

-  Amortisation increased by 6.9%, to EUR 3,006 million. Its evolution is basically due to
exchange rate, new assets put into operation in Network and Renewable businesses
and the amortisation of new IT developments in the United Kingdom (FIS).

- The Provisions heading was EUR 471 million, with a greater expense of EUR 260
million, representing a 123.2% increase due mainly to non-recurring provisions in the
United Kingdom deriving from the closure of the Longannet thermal power station (EUR
288 million), partially offset by the extension of the PTCs in the United States that
reduce write-off of wind farms development costs (EUR 50 million).

2.2.1.4. Financial Result

Net financial result was EUR -1,023 million, which is 8.9% better than that achieved in the same
period of the previous financial year (EUR -1,122 million in 2014), mainly resulting from the 8%
decrease in the result associated to debt. The average cost was 4.05%, 30 bp lower than last
year.

The negative impacts associated with the surplus generated in 2014 generated from the sale of
the stake in EdP, the remuneration of the tariff shortfall and the derivatives result have been
partially offset by the favourable result of several non-recurring contingencies which amount to
EUR 101 million, including interest accrued in legal rulings, gains of FX hedging and the sale of
the stake in Euskaltel.

2.2.1.5 Results of Companies Consolidated by the Equity Method

The “Results of companies consolidated by the equity method” heading reached EUR 55 million
(-59.2% against EUR 135 million in 2014) as a result of the sale of the stake in BBE and the
increase in book value of the stake in Gamesa registered in 2014, which affects the year-on-
year comparison.

2.2.1.6 Income from Non-Current Assets

Income from Non-Current Assets amounted to EUR 125.1 million, EUR 247.8 million less than
in 2014 (-49.5%). During 2015, the most significant operations have been the sale of direct
holding of COELBA and COSERN (+EUR 74 million) to NEOENERGIA and the proceeds of the
arbitration in Bolivia (+EUR 32 million). During 2014, the sale of the portfolio of Itapeb/ (Brazil)
and the NNB Development (Nuclear, United Kingdom), as well as the 25% equity share in BBE
(CCGT in Spain) were the most significant operations amounting to EUR 244 million.

2.2.1.7 Net Profit

Lastly, Net Profit amounted to EUR 2,422 million, a 4.1% increase compared to the figure
obtained in the same period of 2014 (EUR 2,327 million). Recurring Net Profit reached EUR
2,261.4 million (+7.0%) as the result of a good evolution of business and the year on-year
comparison of specific items of each year.

With regard to the “Corporate tax” heading, it decreases by 37% and stands at EUR 527.1
million, as the result of the decline of the tax rate (from 30% to 28%) and the reversal of fiscal
provisions of previous years, which brings about a positive impact of EUR 216 million, and to
the positive impact due to the lower tax rate in the United Kingdom (EUR 168 million, of which
EUR 163 are non-recurrent), which will stand at 18% tax rate in the year 2020.

2.3. Operative evolution of the period

2.3.1 Network business

A. Spain

IBERDROLA had almost 10.8 million supply points and its energy distribution for the year
amounted to 94,113 GWh, a 2.2% increase compared to the previous year (92,131 GWh in
2014).

During 2015, the SAIFI indicator of supply quality was at 61.9 minutes against (55.7 minutes in
2014). It is important to note that this index was impacted by the strong rainstorm, wind and

snow that affected the whole Iberian Peninsula at the end of January and that provoked many
widespread incidents.

C. Mexico

IBERDROLA remains the leading private producer in the country with 5,048 MW (4,987 MW in
2014) in installed capacity.

The electricity supplied from the combined cycle and cogeneration plants amounted to 38,128
GWh (35,175 GWh in 2014), equivalent to a load factor of 86% given that generation with
natural gas is the basis for electricity generation in Mexico. Cumulative availability of the Mexico
plants was 96%.

The award by the Federal Committee of Electricity (CFE) of Mexico of the North East plant
under the Independent Energy Producer category stands out in 2015, with a 25-year contract
for 857 MW in the municipality of El Carmen (Nuevo Leon). This plant, for which the project has
already started, will be operational in 2018. Furthermore, two new cogeneration projects have
started in construction in 2015, with a joint capacity of 106 MW.

In addition to the three previous projects, there are six new plants under construction. Three of
them will be operational in 2016: the 300 MW combined cycle plant in Baja California III (25
years contract with CFE), a 50 MW cogeneration plant and a new 300 MW combined cycle unit
in the Dulces Nombres plant in Monterrey for private customers.

With all of this, in 2018, IBERDROLA’s operating thermal capacity in Mexico in fully
consolidated projects will reach 6,700 MW.

Mexico’s energy reform, and within it the reform of the electricity sector, continues following the
calendar of planned events. With the basic regulatory phase having finished with the publication
of the Electricity Market Guidelines, the Short Term Electricity Market entered into effect in
January 2016, and the first auctions of capacity, energy, and clean energy certificates will be
carried out in the first half of 2016. The reforms are a great opportunity for additional business
growth in the coming years.

project located in the Irish Sea with a capacity of 389 MW which is being jointly developed at
50% with Dong Energy (194.5 MW correspond to IBERDROLA).

IBERDROLA continues the Wikinger offshore project development, up to 350 MW in the Baltic
Sea (Germany). The project is in the component manufacturing phase with a view to starting
offshore works in 2016 and going into operation in late 2017.

IBERDROLA is developing in the United Kingdom the “East Anglia” project in the North Sea. In
February 2015, the East Anglia | project secured a Contract for Difference in the first auction of
its kind in the United Kingdom, for a maximum capacity of 714MW; the project has made
progress during 2015, with a view to a final investment decision and the signing of the contract
with Siemens for the supply of 102 wind turbines of 7MW.

In April 2012, the consortium formed by IBERDROLA and the French company EOLE-RES was
awarded by the French Government the exclusive rights for the operation of the offshore wind
farm of Saint-Brieuc, with a capacity of 500 MW. In 2013, the project was technically redefined
with the aim of using a more modern machine, 8 MW of unit power, made by ADWEN (Joint
venture between Areva and Gamesa). In October 2015, the project submitted its application for
a construction license. In 2016, the Company will work towards answering the requests from the
French administration within the process for approval of the license, as well as on the
consolidation of the main supply agreements for the future farm.

3. LIQUIDITY AND EQUITY RESOURCES

3.1. Leverage

Adjusted net financial debt at 31 December 2015 increased by EUR 2,448 million to EUR
28,067 million compared to the EUR 25,619 million at 31 December 2014, as a result of the
acquisition of UIL in 16 December 2015. Excluding this effect, the net financial debt of 2015
would amount to EUR 25,661 million, a 0.2% increase comparing to the previous period.
Financial leverage stood at 40.7% compared to 41.8% in the same period of the previous year,
since the Equity Resources increase more than debt.

3.3. Debt structure

Regarding the evolution of the financing cost of the Company, at 31 December 2015 it stood at
3.57% compared to 4.14% in the same period of the previous year (Note 25 of the Consolidated
inancial statements).

The structure of the debt by interest rate and currency can be seen in Notes 5 and 25 of the
Consolidated financial statements.

n accordance with the policy of minimizing the financial risks of the Company, foreign currency
risk has continued to be mitigated through the financing of international businesses in local
currencies (Sterling pound, Brazilian real, US dollar, etc.) or in their functional currencies (US
dollar, in the case of Mexico). The percentage of the debt registered in USD increases up to
29.8%, caused, mainly, by the integration of UIL.

IBERDROLA has a strong liquidity position at the end of 2015 exceeding EUR 8,000 million,

equivalent to more than 28 months of the Company's financing needs (Note 50 of the
Consolidated financial statements).

IBERDROLA has a varied debt maturity profile, with an average maturity of approximately six
years, as a result, among other factors, of the active management of liabilities carried out during
this financial year. IBERDROLA’s debt maturity profile at the end of 2015 can be seen in Note

25 of the Consolidated financial statements.

3.4 Working capital

Working capital shows a decrease of EUR 322 million since December 2014 as a result mainly
due to several different effects partially offsetting one another:

e A decrease of “Current financial assets” mainly due to the proceeds of regulatory fees
for tariff shortfall that amount to EUR 360 million.

e Asset and liability balances with Public Administrations amount to, all together, a
reduction of working capital of EUR 201 million.

e The increase in both the Commercial debtors and creditors result, al

| together, in a

decrease of working capital of EUR 21 million.

4. INDUSTRY REGULATION AND FUNCTIONING OF THE ELECTRICITY AND GAS
SYSTEM

Both IBERDROLA and some of the fully or proportionately consolidated subsidiaries engage in
electricity business activities in Spain and abroad (see the Appendix to these Consolidated
financial statements) that are heavily affected by the respective regulatory frameworks.
Following is a description of the main regulations affecting the IBERDROLA Group.

4.1. European Union

In the member states of the European Union in which IBERDROLA is present, particularly in the
UK and Spain, it should comply with EU regulations.

The aim of the European legislation is the constitution of unique gas and electricity markets in
order to facilitate the exchange of this type of energy and allow any consumer in the European
Union to deal freely with any supplier in the EU. In this respect, there are two types of
legislation: the directives, which set out common criteria to be observed in internal markets and
which the member states should transpose into national legislation; and the Regulations, which
establish norms for the supranational issues, especially those related to the transit of gas and
electricity, and are applicable directly.

Another set of regulations that indirectly affects the energy sector are those arising from the
energy and climate policy agreed in 2007. It involves the triple objective of reducing emissions
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 20%, setting a quota of renewable energy of 20% and a target
for reducing consumption by 20%, all by 2020. To meet these objectives by 2020 there have
been four documents accompanying the legislation: the reform of the Emissions Trading
System, EU (EU-ETS), the national targets for emissions from non-EU ETS, the national
objectives on renewable energy and carbon capture and storage.

Since 2009, these institutions have worked to implement the regulation approved in that year
related to, on the one hand, the internal gas and electricity markets and, on the other hand, to
promote renewable energy and to combat climate change. This regulation will be reviewed from
2016 to 2020.

In October 2014, the European Council agreed new targets for 2030: a 40% reduction in GGE
compared to 1990, a share of 27% for renewable energy and a reduction in consumption, also
of 27%. It also agreed to ensure that in 2020 the electricity exchange capacity among countries
was at least 10% of the installed capacity. The legislation arising from these agreements has
yet to be developed.

The legislation on infrastructures is also relevant. The European Union has powers with regards
to trans-European networks, specifically those of energy. During the last few years, various
regulations and programmes have been created to promote a greater connectivity among the
Member States. Specifically, programmes like the Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E),
the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) and the Connecting Europe Facility
(CEF). Lastly, in December 2014, the European Council approved the creation of a Strategic
Investment Plan for the European Union, to mobilize EUR 315,000 million in 2015 — 2017. It will
be structured as a European Fund for Strategic Investments allocated to investments in
infrastructure, including energy and renewable energy networks. The regulations implementing
the Plan will be developed during 2015. In January 2015, the European Commission submitted
the proposal of a Regulation on the European Fund for Strategic Investments to create the
required legal framework. On 27 May 2015, an agreement was reached between the Council,
the Parliament and the European Commission on the proposed Regulation.

211

On 25 February 2015, the European Commission launched a framework strategy for a resistant
Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy, that includes fifteen action points
to be implemented during the mandate of the current European Commission, including, among
others, setting out the goals of an energy union and the steps the Commission will take to
achieve it, a new legislation to redesign and reform the electricity market, ensure the supply for
electricity and gas, EU funding for energy efficiency, a new renewables energy package and a
structural reform of EU-ETS. On 18 November 2015, the European Commission presented its
first State of Energy Union reporting advances achieved in 2015 and steps to be undertaken in
2016. A guidance on Governance of the Energy Union process was also provided.

On 15 July 2015, the European Commission has published a package of documents that
anticipated legislative action in the field of energy markets. Among the numerous published
documents, the following stand out for our interest:

- Communication on market design: analysis of the EC on the functioning of the
market and their suggestions for improvement, which include removing price caps as
well as a better integration of renewables in the market. Also, the EC raises proposals
on capacity mechanisms.

- Communication on retail market (“New Deal” for customers): analyses the
functioning of the retail market and makes proposals for improvement to facilitate
greater interaction with the client (improvements on information issues and
development of new products and agents). Linked to this communication, has published
a document of "best practices" in self-consumption.

- Reform of the ETS directive: legislative proposal to be sent to the European
Parliament and the Council for processing. Covers, inter alia, MSR, and the protection
of sectors in leak of carbon.

Other EU regulation
The following regulations of significance to the energy sector were approved in 2015:

- The Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 of 24 July 2015 established a guideline on capacity
allocation and the management of accumulations in the interconnection. This regulation
lays down detailed guidelines on cross-zonal capacity allocation and congestion
management in the day-ahead and intraday markets, including the requirements for the
establishment of common methodologies for determining the volumes of capacity
simultaneously available between bidding zones, criteria to assess efficiency and a
review process for defining bidding zones. This Regulation shall apply to all
transmission systems and interconnections in the Union, except for the transmission
systems on islands which are not connected with others.

212

- On 9 October, the Decision 2015/1814 of the European Parliament and The Council
was published, concerning the establishment and operation of a market stability reserve
for the Union greenhouse gas emission trading scheme, amending the Directive
2003/87/EC. The market stability reserve will be established in 2018 and the placing of
allowances in the reserve must be operating from 1 January 2019. It was established
with the aim of reducing the quantity of 900 million allowances from auctioning volumes
during the period 2014-2016 that shall not be added to the volumes to be auctioned in
2019 and 2020 but shall instead be placed in the reserve. Each year, a number of
allowances equal to 12% of the total number of allowances in circulation, shall be
deducted from the volume of allowances to be auctioned by the Member States and
shall be placed in the reserve over a period of 12 months beginning on 1 September of
that year, unless the number of allowances to be placed in the reserve would be less
than 100 million. In any year, if the total number of allowances in circulation is less than
400 million, 100 million allowances shall be released from the reserve and added to the
volume of allowances to be auctioned by the Member States.

- On 28 November, the Directive 2015/2193 of the European Parliament and The
Council, of 25 November 2015, was published, on the limitation of emissions of certain
pollutants into the air from medium combustion plants. This Directive establishes the
mandatory register of this units, specific limit for certain components (sulphur dioxide,
nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds) and rules to control other
pollutants (carbon monoxide). The maximum deadline of adaptation contemplated in the
Directive for certain existing plants is 2030.

Industry Regulation in Spain

The National Commission for Market and Competition (Comisién Nacional de Mercado y
Competencia - CNMC) is as a public body attached to the Ministry of Economy and
Competitiveness and is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It has the functions of market
regulation and supervision.

Industry regulation and functioning of the electricity system in Spain

Currently, the electricity sector is regulated by the Electricity Industry Law 24/2013, of 26
December.

This note describes the principles that govern the Law 24/2013.

1. Separation of activities:

The regulation establishes a separation between the activities carried out in the
competitive sector and others that are considered to be regulated activities. Companies
that carry out any activities defined by the law as regulated (economic and technical
management of the system, transmission and distribution) must have these as their sole
corporate purpose and cannot, therefore, engage in unregulated activities (generation,
retailing, or other activities unrelated to electricity or activities abroad). However, in
group of companies in compatible activities performance will be allowed provided that
these are executed by different companies. In addition, it prescribes a separation
between regulated and deregulated activities for accounting purposes.

2. Competition in the power generation activity through the following measures:

— The electricity production is developed in a free competence environment.

213


--- Page 30 ---

— Generation dispatch is established by daily market. Producers of electricity, other
than the special cases and exceptions provided in the law, tender hourly bids for
electricity sales of each of the production units owned by them. The operating order
of the production units is established on the basis of the lowest bids made until
demand is satisfied in each programming period and the energy produced in each
programming period remunerated at the price matched between supply and
demand. There is also the option of recourse to the intraday markets (six every day),
where operators can adjust their positions in respect to their daily programmes.
Meanwhile, the production facilities contribute to the provision of whatever additional
services may be necessary to guarantee an adequate supply, obtaining additional
remuneration for such services.

— In addition to the market remuneration, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism
may establish remuneration entailing payment for capacity. In this regard, the orders
ITC 2794/2007, ITC 3860/2007 and ITC 3127/2011 regulate capacity payments,
which consist of an investment incentive, an environmental incentive and an of
availability service. The Royal Decree-Law 13/2012 temporarily modifies the
investment incentive and the environmental incentive until a new capacity payment
system is developed.

— The installation of the new generating facilities is deemed to be deregulated, without
prejudice to the obtainment of the necessary authorisations.

— Producers are entitled to use in their generating facilities the primary energy sources
that they deem most appropriate, subject to such restrictions in respect to the
environment, etc. as might be provided for in current legislation.

— In December 2014, the Royal Decree 134/2010 introduced an ongoing procedure
until December 2014, called supply security restrictions, which encourages the use
of local coal.

— On 10 June 2014, the Royal Decree 413/2014 was published, which regulates the
electric energy production activity generated from renewable, cogeneration and
waste resources and establishes the methodology for the specific remuneration
regime which applies to facilities that do not meet the minimum necessary to cover
the costs that allow them to compete on an equal level with other technologies in the
market, obtaining "reasonable return" relating to the installation type applicable in
each case. The new specific remuneration system consists of the sum of:

e a “remuneration for investment” (EUR/MW) to cover, where applicable, the
investment costs that cannot be recovered from the electricity sale in the
market;

e a “remuneration for the operation” (EUR/MWh) to cover, where applicable, the
difference between the operation costs and income coming from the electricity
market.

— This new specific remuneration system will be calculated on the basis of a standard
installation during its regulatory lifetime and referenced to the activity carried out by
an efficient and well-run company according to the following:

e the standard revenues for selling the energy;

e the standard operation costs needed for the activity; and

e the standard value of the initial investment.

214


--- Page 31 ---

This remuneration regime will be based on a fair-rate of return of the investments,
defined on the basis of 10 years Government bonds plus a differential, initially fixed
on a 300 basis points for the first regulatory period that ends on 31 December 2019
(this is, 7.398% before taxes).

Six year regulatory periods and three year regulatory sub-periods have been set.
The remuneration parameters related to the market price forecasts may be changed
every three years, including the deviations produced in the sub period. The standard
parameters of the installations may be changed every six years, except for the initial
investment value and the regulatory lifetime, that will remain unchanged during the
installations’ regulatory lifetime. The investment return rate may be changed by law
also every six years, but only for the remunerations in the future. The return on
operation in circumstances where the operating cost of a technology is dependent
on fuel prices may be changed at least once a year. The last order published
regarding to update this operational costs is the Order IET/1345/2015.

The standard value of the investment for new installations will be defined through a
competitive tendering process.

On the other hand, Royal Decree 413/2014 established that an order from the
Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism will establish a classification of standard
installations in terms of the technology, installed capacity or any another
characteristic that may be considered necessary for the application of this
remunerative scheme. Hence, on 20 June 2014, the Ministry published the Order
IET/1045/2014, of 16 June 2014 approving the remuneration parameters for
standard installations already in operation.

The Order IET/1345/2015 establishes the methodology for updating the
remuneration to the operation of facilities with specific retribution regime for such
facilities established in the Order IET/1045/2014 and which has been approved by
the ministerial order a remuneration value of operation except zero and whose
operating costs depend essentially on the price of fuel. Update methodology is
based on the evolution of fuel prices and, in the case of technologies that mainly use
natural gas, it is also considered the variation of tolls for access to the gas network.

4

he Royal Decree 947/2015 establishes a call for granting the specific remuneration
system for new facilities producing electricity from biomass in the mainland electricity
system and for wind technology. They will be allocated up to 200 MW and 500 MW
for biomass and wind (new or repowering), respectively. The allocation procedure
and compensation parameters are developed in the ministerial order IET/2212/2015
of 23 October. Finally, the resolution of 30 November 2015 the Ministry of Energy
announces the auction.

In the Resolution of 18 December 2015, the Ministry of Energy establishes the
criteria to participate in the system adjustment services and approves certain testing
procedures and operating procedures for their adaptation to the Royal Decree
413/2014 of 6 June, by which the activity of electricity production is regulated from
renewable energy, cogeneration and waste. With this Resolution renewable
installations may participate in adjustment services of the electricity system
effectively and on equal conditions with other conventional technologies, thus
improving competition in these markets. This represents an unprecedented advance
in Europe.

215

3. Guarantee of the proper functioning of the system, by using the following
measures:

- System operation: Red Eléctrica de Espafia, S.A. carries on the transmission
management and system operation activities. As system operator, it is responsible
for managing the adjustment markets to guarantee a balance between energy
demand and generation.

- Functioning of the market: With the creation of the Iberian Electricity Market
(Mercado Ibérico de la Electricidad, - MIBEL), since July 2006, the Portuguese and
Spanish forward markets have operated on an integrated basis and, since July
2007, so have the short-term markets (daily and intra-day). Currently, the Iberian
Market Operator (Operador de! Mercado Ibérico - OMI) is responsible for the
operation of MIBEL. OMI was originated in the merge of OMIE (OMI-Spain),
responsible for the management of the daily and intra-day markets, and OMIP
(OMI-Portugal), responsible for the forward market.

4. Legislation applying to regulated activities:

The Law 24/2013 established that distribution and transmission are classified as
regulated activities that are not subject to the free competition and market regime.

The Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 fixes the transitory methodology that will govern the
transmission and distribution activities until the new royal decrees related to
transmission and distribution are approved. It established that, on the one hand, for the
revenue of these activities, an “efficient and well-run company” will be considered
applying uniform criteria throughout the Spanish territory. On the other hand, it
established that these economic regimes allow adequate revenue of a low-risk activity.
The methodology used to calculate the revenue for the distribution activity defines a
“regulatory assets base" for the activity that evolves upwards, according to the
investments made, and downwards, according to the related depreciation, in order to fix
its revenue. In the application of these principles it established a rate of return on assets
linked to Government bonds plus a spread.

Subsequently, the Law 24/2013, published on 26 December, introduced some
modifications. The most relevant ones are the following:

e Introduction of the "efficient and well-run company" concept, considering these
activities as low risk.

e The regulatory periods extend to six years.

e For regulatory purposes, the accrual and collection of the remuneration generated
by the installations that entered into operation in the year n starts in the year n+2.

e The assets in operation not fully depreciated will receive an investment
remuneration considering their net value for the financial remuneration. The
financial remuneration rate will be based on ten year Government bonds plus an
appropriate spread for a low risk activity.

Finally, on 30 December 2013, two royal decrees were published regulating the new
remuneration methodology of the transmission (Royal Decree 1047/2013) and
distribution (Royal Decree 1048/2013) activities were, developing the regulatory and tax
measures that started on the second half of 2013.

216


--- Page 33 ---

The methodology set out in the Royal Decree is based on new standard investment and
operating costs. The aim is to reduce costs, introducing efficiency mechanisms and
limitations concerning the annual investment volume. The recalculation of the base
remuneration will be carried out during its first year of implementation, which includes
the initial regulatory asset of the companies, that can vary with respect to the one
recognised on the Royal Decree-Law 9/2013. Investment limits are also established
(sector’s maximum 0.13% GDP). The financial remuneration rate of the asset embodies
the principles established in the new Electricity Industry Law, referenced to the ten
years Government bonds plus an appropriate spread for a low risk activity.

The Royal Decree 1048/2013 includes changes in the existing incentives, in quality (it
may fluctuate between +2% and -3% of the Company’s remuneration) and losses (it
may fluctuate between +1% and -2%). A new incentive regarding fight against fraud is
created, which may reach 1.5% of the Company's remuneration. For the application of
the new remuneration model contained in the RD 1048/2013, its regulatory
development must be published; until then, as established in the RD, the remuneration
scheme of the RDL 9/2013 will be maintained.

The remuneration system culminates with orders IET/2659/2015 and IET/2660/2015,
published on 12 December 2015, which determine the type installations and unit values
to consider when calculating the remuneration for 2016 and following.

Tariffs or access tolls:

Access tolls are uniform across the country and are collected by the distributors and
carriers, which act as the collection agents of the Electricity System.

The Royal Decree-Law 14/2010, of 23 December, extended the application of access
tolls to electricity producers of both the ordinary and the special regime, and established
that the producers would be regulated taking into consideration the energy fed into the
grid. In addition, provided that the tolls to be paid by the electricity producers have not
been implemented, this royal decree-law establishes that an access toll of EUR 0.5 per
MWh fed into the grid will be applied to producers that are connected to the grid.

Subsequently, the Royal Decree 1544/2011, of 31 October implemented the
aforementioned regulation of access tolls for electricity producers.

On 1 February 2014, the ministry published the Order IET/107/2014, of 31 January,
which revised the electric power access tolls for 2014 and includes two main aspects:
firstly, it changes the weighting of the fixed part of the access tolls (paid on the basis of
the contracted capacity); secondly, the tolls were increased to cover the growth of the
regulated costs.

Lastly, the Law 32/2014, of 22 December, on Metrology, modifies the Law 24/2013 on
the Electricity Sector, clarifying that the legal authority to establish the structure and
conditions applicable to the access tariffs for transportation and distribution networks
corresponds to the Government.

Finally, the Order IET/2444/2014 continued access tolls established in 2014, and the
pricing structure of power and energy defined in 2014.

217

6. Progressive deregulation of the electricity supply and introduction of the retailing
activity

The supply of electric power is completely deregulated and all consumers must contract
the supply of electricity with a retailer. From 1 July 2009, those consumers who fulfil
certain criteria have been able to opt to contract electricity with a “Last Resort Retailer”
(Comercializadora de Ultimo Recurso - CUR), which from July 2014 will become a
Reference Retailer (Comercializadora de Referencia - COR), with the Last Resort Rate,
now the Voluntary Price for the Small Consumer (Precio Voluntario para el Pequefio
Consumidor - PVPC). The Last Resort Rate (Tarifa de Ultimo Recurso - TUR) has been
kept for vulnerable consumers and those who do not fulfil the requirements for the
PVPC, temporarily do not have a current contract with a free market distributor.

The Law 3/2014, of 27 March, obliges the reference distributors to offer contracts in
which the price of electric power is fixed for a specific period for consumers with a right
to the PVPC.

The Royal Decree 216/2014, of 28 March, establishes the methodology for calculating
the voluntary prices of electric power for the small consumer and their legal regimen for
contracting. It determines the structure of the PVPC that will be applicable to low
voltage consumers with a contracted capacity up to 10 kW. Similarly, it determines the
procedure for calculating the production cost of electric power on the basis of the hourly
price in the daily market during the billing period. In addition, as established by Law
3/2014, it provides the alternative of the consumer to contracting an electricity price
fixed for a year with the reference distributor.

This legislation provides the Spanish electricity sector with three forms in which
distributors can supply power to consumers:

- Reference supply

+ PVPC: the method that applies by default from 1 July 2014 if the consumer
was subject to the previous TUR.

+ Annual fixed price in a regulated market offered by the reference distributor.
- Contracting in the deregulated market by contracting freely with a distributor.

- Last Resort Supply: a form of supply applicable to vulnerable consumers and
those who do not fulfil the requirements for the PVPC and temporarily do not
have a current contract with a free market distributor.

The Resolution of 2 June 2015 of the State Secretariat for Energy approved six
procedures necessary for billing hourly to those consumers covered by the PVPC. This
resolution establishes a period of adaptation of IT systems until 1 October 2015. From
this date onwards, all consumers having an hourly meter should be billed according to
the hourly consumption and price.

A Supreme Court ruling of 3 November 2015 was published on 6 February 2016,
cancelling the fixed sales margin used to calculate the PVPC as remuneration for main
distributors. The Supreme Court withdrew the sum of 4 €/kW/year as of 1 April 2014,
and ordered the government to set a new value after adopting a calculation
methodology. Until then billing will continue at the current rate as a provisional value, as
stipulated in the Ministerial Order IET/2735/2015 on electricity charges for 2016.

218


--- Page 35 ---

Price formation and tariff structure

The Law 24/2013 regulates the aspects relating to the PVPCs, which are defined as the
maximum prices that the distributors that assume the reference supply obligations will
be able to charge.

They will be calculated as the sum of the following items:

- The production cost of electricity, based on market mechanisms, taking account
of the average price expected in the production market during the invoicing
period.

- The corresponding access tariffs and charges, and
- The corresponding distribution costs.

Social Tariff

The Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 creates the social tariff for certain consumers with
certain social, consumption and purchase power characteristics supplied at the TUR at
their normal residence and the financing of the social tariff costs. This tariff is calculated
as 75% of the PVPC. Until these social and economic indicators are developed for
application, the social tariff will apply to individuals in their normal residence supplied
under the last resort scheme with contracted capacity of less than 3 kW, to large
families or families whose members are all unemployed and to certain pensioners 60
years old or older receiving minimum pensions.

Such costs shall be borne by the parent company of the vertically integrated companies.
The allocation of the social tariff costs among such companies will be made according
to the number of supplies connected to the distribution network and the number of
customers of the retail business of the Group.

The Royal Decree 968/2014, of 21 November, develops the methodology for fixing the
percentage shares of the amounts to be financed with regard to the social tariff. These
percentages will be calculated annually by the CNMC for each business group, as the
relation among (i) a figure that will be the sum of the annual averages of the number of
feeds connected to the distribution networks of the distributors and of the number of
customers of the distributors in which the group participates and (ii) another figure that
will correspond to the sum of all the annual average values of feeds and customers of
all the business groups that should be considered for the effects of this sharing.

On 20 October 2015, the Ministry published the Order IET/2182/2015, of 15 October,
which sets the percentage shares of the amounts to be financed with regard to the
social tariff for 2015. According to this order, IBERDROLA should finance the 38.26%.

Load Manager

The Royal Decree-Law 6/2010 introduced the figure of the load manager as another
agent in the electric system.

219


--- Page 36 ---

10.

The Royal Decree 647/2011, which was approved in May 2011, regulates the functions
of these load managers that are defined as “companies that, as consumers, are
authorised to resell electricity for power recharging services. Load managers are the
only subjects with wholesale customer character under the terms provided by the
applicable Community regulations.” The mentioned royal decree sets forth the
requirements and obligations of these agents. It also created a new super off-peak tariff
applicable to contracts of up to 15 kW, thereby creating a third hour period (from 1 a.m.
to 7 a.m.) aimed at encouraging the charging of electric vehicles in this period.

Emission allowances

Regarding environment regulations, the Directive 2003/87/CE is remarkable, relating to
the issuance of CO, emissions allowances, which affects the industry and electricity
companies to deliver an emission allowance for each ton of CO, emitted by a plant. The
goal for 2020 is that emissions from sectors covered by the EU ETS will be 21% lower
than in 2005.

In 2009, within the European Union's Green Package for energy and climate change,
the Directive 29/2009/EC was approved, introducing changes and extending the
European Union emissions trading system beyond 2012. The phase 3 (2013-20),
significantly different from previous phases, is based on rules which are far more
harmonised than before. The main changes in the Directive were: the default method of
allocating allowances is auctioning, instead of free allocation, although transitional free
allocation is envisaged in some cases; extension of the periods of compliance to be
followed by consecutive periods in which the amount of rights is determined on an
European Union-wide scale; it also provides that allowances can be carried over one
period to the next. As a result of the new rules, since 2013, IBERDROLA has no longer
had the right to receive any free allocation.

The auctioning of allowances is governed by the EU ETS Auctioning Regulation. This
covers the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning to ensure it is
conducted in an open, transparent, harmonised and non-discriminatory manner. Two
auction platforms are in place: European Energy Exchange-EEX (common platform for
the large majority of countries participating in the EU ETS) and Futures Europe - ICE
(acts as the United Kingdom's platform). Member States' shares in the auctioning
volume in 2013 to 2020 are distributed as follows: 80% on the basis of their share of
verified emissions in 2005 or the average of the 2005-2007 period; 10% are allocated to
the least wealthy EU member states as an additional source of revenue to help them
invest in reducing the carbon intensity of their economies and adapting to climate
change; the remaining 2% is given as a ‘Kyoto bonus' to nine EU Member States which
by 2005 had reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% of levels in their
Kyoto Protocol base year.

A surplus of emission allowances has built up in the EU ETS since 2009, largely due to
the economic crisis (which has reduced emissions more than anticipated) and high
imports of international credits. This has led to lower carbon prices and thus a weaker
incentive to reduce emissions. The European Commission is addressing this through
short- and long-term measures. As a short-term measure the European Commission
postponed in February 2014 the auctioning of 900 million allowances until 2019-2020
(backloading).

As a long-term solution, a new stability reserve of the Market Stability Reserve (MRS)
will be introduced in 2018, operating from 1 January 2019. The reserve will address the
current surplus of allowances and improve the system's resilience to major shocks by
adjusting the supply of allowances to be auctioned. It will operate entirely according to
pre-defined rules. The backloading was also amended by MSR Decision, passed in
October 2015: backloaded allowances will not return to the market, instead they will be
introduced in MSR.

Revenue shortfall

Electricity Industry Law 54/1997, of 27 November 1997, introduced the liberalisation of
electricity generation and electric power trading. The difference between the access
tariff revenue established by the Government and real costs related to these tariffs
resulted in a revenue shortfall which led to problems and modifications in the functioning
of the system.

To fund this shortfall, which is deferred through the recognition of long-term collection
rights recovered by the annuities incorporated in annual fees, a series of measures
have been adopted.

The first measure was Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, of 30 April 2009, that set limits to the
increase of the shortfall and defined a framework for the gradual sufficiency of the
access tolls. It also addressed the mechanism for funding the tariff shortfall through a
securitisation fund set up for this purpose, Electricity Deficit Redeeming Fund (Fondo de
Titulizacién del Déficit del Sistema Eléctrico - FADE).

As measures adopted since 2009 proved to be insufficient throughout 2013, the
Government carried out a process of regulatory and tax reform for the electricity sector.
As a step prior to this reform, Law 15/2012 established new taxes and Royal Decree-
Law 9/2013, was approved, adopting urgent measures to guarantee the financial
stability of the electric system methodology for the calculation of the remuneration of the
transmission and distribution activities, special regime and capacity payments, among
other measures.

Finally, Law 24/2013 is governed by the principle of economic and _ financial
sustainability of the electricity system, meaning that any regulatory measure which
causes an increase in costs or a reduction in income for the electricity system should
incorporate an equivalent reduction of other cost items or an equivalent increase in
income that ensures the equilibrium of the system. Thus, the possibility of new shortfalls
accumulating, as have occurred in the past, is ruled out.

This principle is reinforced with the obligation to automatically review the tolls and fees if
the temporary imbalances between revenues and costs of the electricity system exceed
the following limits from 2014 onwards:

e 2% of the income estimated for the system in a given year.

e The accumulated debt due to imbalances in preceding periods may not exceed
5% of the income estimated for the system in a given year.

The part of the imbalance that, without exceeding such limits, is not compensated by
increases in tolls and fees will be financed by the parties to the settlement system in
proportion to the remuneration that corresponds to them for their activities.

The amounts contributed by this concept will be returned in the corresponding
settlements after five years with an interest rate.

221

12.

In contrast to the previous system, these imbalances will not be financed exclusively by
large companies and the collection rights corresponding to income shortfall may not be
assigned to the Securitisation Fund of the Electricity System Debt after 1 January 2013.

With regard to the excess income that could arise, it will be used to compensate
imbalances from previous years and, as long as there are debts pending from previous
years, the access tolls and fees may not be revised downwards.

Royal Decree 680/2014, of 1 August, regulates the procedure of budgeting, recognition,
settlement and control of the surcharges on the production of electric power in the
isolated electricity systems of the non-peninsular territories charged to the central state
budget, thus developing the provisions of Law 24/2013, which established that from 1
January 2014, 50% of these surcharges would be financed against the central state
budget.

At the end all this measures have enabled that the final liquidation of 2014 closed with a
surplus for EUR 550.3 million. This surplus will not be used as an income in the
regulated settlement of the current financial year.

Self-supply

Self-consumption is regulated for the first time in the Law 24/2013 and defined as the
electric energy provided by generation installations associated with a consumer. Self-
consumers must pay the same access tariff for the consumed energy (either taken from
the network or from its own installation) as other customers. In addition, a mandatory
register for self-consumption installations is created.

Later, Royal Decree - Law 9/2015 of 10 of July modified Law 24/2013 to establish the
possibility of setting reductions in tolls, fees and costs for certain categories of
consumers for which the maximum contracted power consumption and generation
installed shall not exceed 10 kW. This measure is exceptionally and it will be
implemented as long as the safety and economic and financial sustainability of the
system is ensured.

Finally, Royal Decree 900/2015 of 10 of October regulated the administrative, technical
and financial conditions of the self-consumption modalities. It differences two types of
self-consumption:

e Supply with self-consumption: in the case of a consumer in a single electricity
supply point or installation that has inside a network of one or more installations to
generate electricity for self-consumption and were not recognised in the
administrative record of energy production facilities. In this case, there will be a
single subject, which will be the consumer. The contracted power shall not exceed
100 kW and discharges energy to the grid will not receive monetary compensation.

e Production with self-consumption: in the case of a consumer in an electricity supply
point or installation, which is associated with one or several production facilities duly
registered in the administrative record of energy production facilities. In this case
there will be two subjects, which will be the consumer and the producer.

222

14.

Regarding the economic regime, and until charges associated with system costs are
approved, the self-consumer must pay a fixed charge related to the maximum power
generation for manageable generation facilities in the tariff period and a variable charge
applicable to the self-consumed energy. Consumers included in the modality of supply
with self-consumption which power contracted is less than or equal to 10 kW will be
exempt from the temporal charge for the self-consumed energy. Apart from the charges
for costs and system services, self-consumers also pay networks tolls for the networks’
use like other consumers.

Interruptibility

The interruptibility service for a consumer consists of the reduction of its contracted
capacity in response to a reduction order from the system operator. This order will be
given taking account of the needs that arise in the operation of the electricity system,
according to criteria of security and lowest cost.

The system operator will request the execution of the capacity reduction option,
following economic and technical criteria:

+ Economic criteria: In situations where the application of the service has a lower
cost than that of the adjustment services of the system.

+ Technical criteria: As a rapid response mechanism in emergency situations in
the operation of the system.

To execute the option, the system operator will send a power reduction order to the
service providers who will reduce their active power demanded until the committed
residual power values are fulfilled.

The allocation of the interruptibility service will be carried out through an auction
procedure managed by the system operator, as established in Order IET/2013/2013,
therefore guaranteeing the effective provision of the service and its execution at the
lowest cost for the electricity system.

The Resolution of 10 October 2014 of the State Secretariat for Energy, approves the
characteristics of the competitive auction procedure for the allocation of the
interruptibility demand management service for the 2015 electricity season (applicable
from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015). Among others aspects, this resolution
defines the maximum amounts to be auctioned for each type of product, the starting
price, the period of delivery of the interruptible power and the date of each auction for
the allocation of the interruptibility demand management service for the season (the
auctions took place from 17 November 2014 to 21 November 2014). Subsequently, an
extraordinary auction, approved by means of the Resolution of 17 December 2014, was
carried out.

The Resolution of 9 July 2015 of the State Secretariat for Energy approves the calendar
of the competitive auction for the allocation of the interruptibility demand management
service for the 2016 electricity season. The auction took place between 3 August 2015
and 4 September 2015.

Energetic efficiency

Energetic efficiency is an essential aspect of the European 2020 strategy for
sustainable growth and one of the most effective forms of strengthening the security of
energy supply and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In this
sense, the European Union has set itself the target of achieving a 20% improvement in
energy efficiency by 2020.

223


--- Page 40 ---

Law 18/2014, of 15 October, approving measures for growth, competitiveness and
efficiency, contains a set of mechanisms designed to achieve the energy saving targets
established in the Energy Efficiency Directive. To this end, it created the National
Energy Efficiency Fund, managed by the Institute for the Diversification and Saving of
Energy (/nstituto para la Diversificacién y Ahorro de la Energia - DAE) and financed by
an annual contribution from all suppliers of gas and electricity, wholesalers of oil
products and of liquid petroleum gases, according to their sales. Order IET/289/2015, of
20 February, established the contribution obligations for 2015.

Finally, Law 8/2015, of 21 May 2015, modified Law 18/2014 and established that the
obliged entities must make an annual contribution from 2016 onwards to the National
Energy Efficiency Fund in four instalments: on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and
31 December of each year. In addition, in order to establish the annual contribution for
each obliged entity, positive or negative adjustments can be made, resulting from data
provided by the obliged entities, such as sales and other variables, and data set out by
the relevant ministerial order of the previous year.

Industry regulation and functioning of the gas system in Spain

The natural gas sector in Spain has undergone significant changes in its structure and operation
in the last ten years, from a monopoly to a fully open market, driven mainly by the deregulation
measures in European Directives (2009/73/EC is currently in force) aimed at opening up
markets and creating a single European gas market.

These liberalised principles have been incorporated and developed in Spanish law through Law
34/1998 of the Hydrocarbon Sector, which began the deregulation process and, more recently,
through the Law 12/2007 and the Royal Decree-Law 13/2012 which completed the process.

The Hydrocarbon Industry Law (1998) laid the foundations for the new gas system, particularly
with regard to the separation of activities (regulated and deregulated), the introduction of third-
party access to the regulated network, the abolition of the former concessions for piped gas
supply and their conversion into regulated administrative permits, and the establishment of a
timetable for progressive market deregulation.

In line with these principles, the gas system has been structured around two types of activities:
regulated activities (regasification, storage, transmission and distribution) and deregulated
activities (trading and supply).

The Hydrocarbon Industry Law 34/1198 provided for the legal separation of deregulated and
regulated activities and the segregation for accounting purposes of the various regulated
activities. In addition, with the publication of Law 12/2007, Spain moved a step closer to
achieving functional separation between network activities and deregulated activities and
between network activities and technical system management. In 2012, Royal Decree-Law
13/2012 was approved, transposing Directive 2009/73/EC, and established further measures of
separation in management of the transmission network.

Although the Hydrocarbon Industry Law established the general principles underpinning the
new Spanish gas system, the sector’s deregulation did not come into practice until 2001,
following publication of Royal Decree-Law 6/2000, on urgent measures to intensify competition
in the goods and services markets, and Royal Decree 949/2001, regulating third party access to
gas installations and establishing an integrated economic system for the natural gas sector.

224


--- Page 41 ---

The first of these decrees enacted certain elements of the Hydrocarbon Industry Law with the
aim of fostering measures that would facilitate the elimination of entry barriers for new supply
companies. In particular, it created the technical system manager (ENAGAS, S.A.), provided for
a 25% gas release under the contract for natural gas brought from Algeria through the Maghreb
pipeline, and brought forward the timetable for deregulation.

The second, Royal Decree 949/2001, established firstly the specific terms and conditions for
third-party network access and, secondly, a remuneration system for regulated activities and a
cost-based system of tariffs, tolls and fees structured according to pressure levels and
consumption bands.

The remuneration assigned to each company as well as the tariffs, tolls and fees are updated
periodically by ministerial orders and resolutions.

The economic system also established a settlement procedure that would allow for
redistribution of revenues collected in the form of tariffs, tolls and fees between the various
regulated activities in accordance with the remuneration method established. The body
responsible for effecting this redistribution is the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism.

Other issues related to the regulation of the transmission, distribution and supply businesses,
the administrative authorisation procedures for natural gas facilities and the regulation of certain
aspects of the supply business are dealt with in Royal Decree 1434/2002.

As for the technical operation of the system, the operating regulations are established in Order
ITC 3126/2005 enacting the gas system technical management rules. Inter alia, these
regulations established that each operator is individually responsible for maintaining its liquidity
and enacts specific protocols for the conduct of the technical system manager in exceptional
operating circumstances.

Despite the sector's progressive deregulation, prevailing regulations uphold the state's
obligation to ensure the safety and continuity of supply. To this end, Royal Decree 1766/2007
stipulates that direct market suppliers and consumers must maintain minimum security stocks
equivalent to 20 days’ consumption. In addition, it limits the maximum percentage of gas
supplies that may be sourced from a single country to 50%.

The State also maintains responsibility for obligatory planning work for certain infrastructures
(for example, gas pipelines forming the core transmission network, the secondary transmission
network, the determination of the total liquid natural gas regasification capacity necessary to
supply the system and core natural gas storage facilities). For all other infrastructures, the
state’s planning work is provisional only. In 2012, Royal Decree-Law 13/2012 enacted a series
of measures to halt the construction of new infrastructure in a context of falling demand for gas.

As mentioned above, in Spain the deregulation process was completed with Law 12/2007
transposing Directive 2003/55/EC. The two key changes enacted by this law were the
elimination of regulated supply and the functional separation between network activities and
deregulated activities.

As in the electricity sector, from 1 July 2008, all customers in Spain are free to choose their
supplier of gas, although there is a tariff of last resort, a regulated price eligible for customers of
low pressure natural gas with an annual consumption of less than 50,000 kWh. The price is
automatically calculated additively and is called tariff of last resort.

225


--- Page 42 ---

The Law 18/2014, on measures for growth, competitiveness and efficiency, and previously the
Royal Decree-Law 8/2014, established the principle of economic and financial sustainability for
the gas system. This principle is reinforced with the obligation to automatically review tolls and
fees if the annual imbalance between revenues and costs of the gas system exceeds the
following limits:

- 10% of the income receivable for the year; or

- 15% of the sum of the annual imbalance plus annual payments recognised and pending
amortisation.

The part of the imbalance that, without exceeding the above limits, is not compensated by the
increase in tolls and fees will be financed by the parties to the settlement system in proportion to
their remuneration. The amounts contributed will be returned in the following five years and will
earn an interest rate equivalent to the market rate.

The shortfall accumulated at 31 December 2014 will be financed by the owners of the
installations during a period of 15 years.

On the other hand, the remuneration of the regulated activities will be based on the costs
necessary for an efficient and well-managed company to carry out the relevant activity, following
the principle of performing the relevant activity at the lowest cost for the gas system. In addition,
the remuneration of regulated activities will be on the basis of six-year regulatory periods.
However, it is possible to adjust every three years the remuneration parameters in exceptional
circumstances. The first regulatory period ends on 31 December 2020.

The remuneration system for distribution is based on the remuneration of the previous year,
adjusted for changes in productivity and new customers.

The remuneration system for transmission, storage facilities and regasification is based on the
net value of the associated assets. In addition, the associated operating and maintenance costs
and premiums for continuity of service are also factored in to calculate the remuneration
system.

The Hydrocarbon Industry Law has been modified by Law 8/2015, of 21 May 2015.

The main aspects introduced by Law 8/2015 regarding the gas system are:

- The creation of an organised wholesale gas market.
- The designation of the operator of the regulated gas market.
- Some measures relating to minimum security stock levels are adopted.

- CORES (Corporacién de Reservas Estratégicas de Productos Petroliferos) is enabled
to constitute, maintain or manage natural gas and liquefied natural gas strategic stocks.

- Pursuant to the Efficiency Fund (Fondo Nacional de Eficiencia Energética) the law
permits the refund of contributions when necessary (in case of mistake, for example).

- Incentives established, benefiting the landowners and regions where the activities of
exploration and production with conventional and non-conventional (including fracking)
techniques are developed.

- Inspections may be carried out by any natural gas installation company (not only
distribution companies).

226


--- Page 43 ---

Finally, Royal Decree 984/2015 of 30 October 2015 regulates the organised wholesale gas
market and the third party access to the facilities of the natural gas system. This market
will initially include the negotiation of short-term standardized products by an electronic platform
managed by the market operator (MIBGAS-OMEL), with a centralised collateral management.
In addition, this market will centralize the hiring capacity through an electronic platform
managed by the Technical System Operator (ENAGAS), with standardized products and
auction procedures.

Industry regulation in the UK

The principal laws that govern Scottish Power Ltd.'s (hereinafter, SCOTTISH POWER) activities
are the Electricity Act 1989 (Electricity Act) and the Gas Act 1986 (Gas Act), as substantially
amended and supplemented by numerous subsequent enactments, including the Gas Act 1995,
the Utilities Act 2000, the Energy Act 2004, the Energy Act 2008, the Energy Act 2010, the
Energy Act 2011, the Energy Act 2013 and various EU directives. These specific energy laws
are supplemented by UK and the EU legislation relating to competition and consumer
protection.

1. The Regulatory Authorities

The principal regulatory authority for utilities is the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority
(GEMA), comprising a chairman and other members appointed by the Secretary of State for
Energy and Climate Change. GEMA is supported by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets
(OFGEM). The main instrument of regulation used by GEMA is the licencing regime which in
most cases requires the various aspects of the energy industry to be carried out under a licence
to which standard conditions apply. In addition, there are a number of statutory obligations,
known as relevant requirements, which are enforced by GEMA as if they were licence
conditions.

GEMA's principal objective is to promote the interests of present and future consumers and
promote effective competition. Under the Energy Act 2010, the interests of such consumers
must be taken as a whole, including their interests in the reduction of greenhouse gases and in
the security of the supply of gas and electricity to them.

In furthering this objective GEMA must ensure that all reasonable demands for electricity and
gas are met, ensure that licence holders are able to finance the activities they are obliged to
undertake, and contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Further provision
concerning the duties of GEMA has been made by the Energy Act 2013, but the provisions in
question are yet to be implemented.

GEMA's functions include the granting of licences (and their revocation in certain limited
circumstances), the making of changes to licence conditions (including the operation of price
controls for the monopoly network functions), the review of industry code modifications,
operating schemes for promoting renewable electricity and energy efficiency, and the
enforcement of the industry's obligations.

GEMA has the power to impose monetary penalties for past and ongoing breaches of licence
conditions and relevant requirements and it can order that redress is provided to consumers.
Fines and redress orders for a particular breach can in aggregate be up to 10% of the
licensee’s applicable turnover.

227


--- Page 44 ---

The principal Regulatory Authority for competition matters is the Competition and Markets
Authority (CMA). They can undertake general market investigations and, working concurrently
with GEMA, can investigate potential breaches of competition law in the utility field. Consumer
protection matters are enforced by the CMA, OFGEM and Local Authority Trading Standards
departments.

a) Licences

Companies within the SCOTTISH POWER Group hold licences for various functions including:
- the supply of electricity;
- the generation of electricity;

- the distribution of electricity in the South Scotland area, in the Merseyside and North of
Wales area;

- the supply of gas;

- the shipping of gas (that is, arranging for the insertion, the transmission, and the
removal of it from the public network); and

- the transportation of gas to certain specific sites (such as proposed new gas fired power
stations).

The third package of European Union Directives on electricity (2009/72/EC) established
additional restrictions to the ownership of transmission companies. On 19 June 2012, Scottish
Power Transmission Limited (SPTL) was certified by OFGEM, in accordance with the Directive's
Article 9, with the European Commission approval, on the basis that SPTL's arrangements
guarantee more efficient independence than the ITO provisions under the Directive's Chapter V.
As a result, the provisions relating ownership separation do not apply to SPTL.

The conditions of licences regulate such matters as:

- for network licences: the quality of service and the charges that can be made.

- for supply to domestic consumers: consumer protection provisions including rules on
standards of conduct, simpler tariffs, provision of information, debt and disconnection,
cost reflective pricing, in relation to payment methods, information supply to customers
and on fair trading.

- for most types of licence: rules requiring adherence to industry codes that set down the

detailed technical rules for operating the industry, and providing for OFGEM to
determine whether proposed changes to the codes should go ahead.

228


--- Page 45 ---

The Gas Act 1995 and Utilities Act 2000 introduced standard licence conditions to ensure that
all holders of a particular licence type are subject to the same conditions. Under the Electricity
and Gas Regulations 2011 (Internal Markets), modifications of individual or standard licencing
terms no longer require the holders’ consent. However, affected licence holders and other
parties can appeal to the Competition Commission (CMA since April 2014) on both procedure
and substance, except where legislation allows the Secretary of State to modify licence
conditions for certain specified purposes (typically the delivery of industry wide reforms). In most
cases, these powers are time limited. Changes to licence conditions can also be made without
the right of appeal in pursuance of a European Union obligation, using powers in the European
Communities Act 1972.

When OFGEM makes a decision on modifying an industry code which runs contrary to the
views of the relevant industry governance body, the decision can, with certain exceptions, be
appealed to the CMA.

2. Competition Legislation

GEMA also has concurrent powers with the CMA to apply the Competition Act 1998, the Fair
Trading Act 1973 and the Enterprise Act 2002 to the energy sector in Great Britain. Accordingly,
GEMA can levy fines of up to 10% of turnover for breaches of the prohibitions of anticompetitive
agreements or the abuse of a dominant position.

Under the Enterprise Act, GEMA and the CMA have powers to initiate a market investigation
where it appears that competition has been prevented, restricted or distorted by any feature of a
market, so far as it relates to commercial activities connected with the generation, transmission
and supply of gas and electricity (and where it would not be appropriate to operate by the
provisions of the Competition Act 1998 or using any other powers). If the GEMA or CMA finds
such adverse effects on competition, it is required to take proportionate steps to remedy them.
The CMA’s powers are extensive and can range from changes to licences to forced
divestments, if they are justified by the evidence and findings.

b) CMA market investigation into energy

A market investigation was initiated on 26 June 2014 by GEMA. The investigation is into the
operation of retail gas and electricity markets for domestic and small business consumers, and
the wholesale markets that support such supply. On 7 July 2015, the CMA published its
provisional findings and a “remedies notice” containing suggested remedies. The provisional
findings concluded that competition in the wholesale gas and electricity markets works well and
that the presence of vertically integrated firms does not have a detrimental impact on
competition. No strong case was found for returning to the old “pool” system for the Wholesale
Electric Market (Mercado Eléctrico Mayorista — MEM).

However, a number of adverse effects on competence were identified in the retail market, some
due to over-regulation, but mainly focussed on the possibility that people on standard variable
tariffs may be losing out through lack of engagement in the market. The CMA has put forward a
number of remedies for consideration. Most are focussed on increasing competition in this
segment, but they have also suggested (while recognising the difficulties) a transitional
safeguard regulated tariff to apply while other changes take effect. This would be set above the
“efficient” level of pricing, with the aim of mitigating the damage to competition that might
otherwise arise. The CMA has also made a number of wider proposals including zonal charging
for transmission losses, tighter control of non-competitive low carbon contracts, changes to
industry code governance, and reforms to regulatory policy including GEMA’s duties.

229


--- Page 46 ---

After an extension of the deadline, the investigation must be completed by 25 June 2016.
c) EU Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT)

GEMA also enforces REMIT in the United Kingdom. It has the power to levy unlimited fines for
breaches and since 13 April 2015 can initiate criminal prosecutions for breach of the market
manipulation element of REMIT against both companies and the individual employees involved.
In the case of individuals, the penalty can include imprisonment for up to two years.

d) Price controls

Prices for the sale of electricity and gas by utilities to final consumers are not currently
controlled in the United Kingdom. Nowadays, there is no controlled tariff for certain categories of
consumer, although all the major suppliers must offer special discounts for certain
disadvantaged customers under the Warm Homes Discount programme. The total cost of
discounts of the Warm Home Discount programme for SCOTTISH POWER in 2014-2015 was 6
Sterling pounds per customer account (counting gas and electricity separately) and, like any
other costs, suppliers are free to pass on the cost to their tariffs. OFGEM has implemented
licence modifications requiring any price variation by payment method to be cost reflective.

In 2014 and 2015, suppliers must pay 12 Sterling pounds to each person who is a domestic
electricity customer on a specified date in each year, and the United Kingdom Government in
turn repays that sum from taxpayer funds to the suppliers upon production of suitable evidence.
This arrangement effectively takes the cost, but not the administration of the Warm Home
Discount programme in relation to the public purse in those two years. This requirement expires
after 2015.

Similarly, there are currently no controls other than those established in the Competition Act
1998 and the Transmission Constraint Licence Condition (TCLC), on prices charged to
commercial customers or on other prices in the wholesale electricity and gas markets.

TCLC prohibits electricity generators from making excessive profits resulting from balancing
actions. OFGEM has published guidelines on the interpretation and application of the TCLC.
Enforcement decisions under the framework of the TCLC are subject to review by the
Competition Appeal Tribunal, rather than the review by the courts applicable to other GEMA
enforcement decisions. The condition expires five years after its enactment, having been
implemented on 29 October 2012, and is renewable for another two years.

OFGEM has implemented electricity market liquidity obligations for large integrated supply and
generation businesses, including SCOTTISH POWER. These include obligations to facilitate
trading with smaller companies and also an obligation to market make in a number of wholesale
products during two specified “windows” in each business day. Although the prices of bids and
offers are not regulated, the licence condition limits the spread between them. There are rules
designed to give some protection to obligated licences in fast or volatile markets. To date, no
material costs have arisen from this obligation.

Following the Retail Market Review, OFGEM has implemented limits on the products that can
be sold in the domestic energy market.

230


--- Page 47 ---

These include restrictions on the number and composition of tariffs (with a maximum of four
basic tariffs plus variations according to parameters such as form of payment, meter type and
region). The CMA has proposed removing these restrictions. There are also information
requirements and requirements for notifying customers of lower tariffs. OFGEM has also
implemented code of conduct for customer treatment which covers all aspects of the supplier-
client relationship.

The networks are considered to be a natural monopoly. Therefore, their prices have been
controlled and this is now achieved through the new RIIO framework (Revenue = Incentives +
Innovation + Outputs). This involves setting a revenue profile for an eight year period (with a
limited revision every four years) based on the regulator’s assessment of the costs of an
efficient network operator and the likely capital programme (aided by a business plan submitted
by the Company) in order to calculate the revenue needed to meet a target return on
investments. The formula uses a Market Indicator for setting the debt cost, and phases in (for
electricity) an asset depreciation period of 45 years, replacing the 20 year period used
previously. Various incentives have been added to the formula which also takes account of
inflation in order to calculate the permissible revenues for the network.

Under the RIIO framework, there is a greater emphasis on outputs and innovation, as well as on
the role that network companies can play in developing a sustainable energy sector.

In the transmission business, SPTL’s new RIIOT1 framework became effective from April 2013.
In distribution, the new RIIO for the Scottish Power network in the south of Scotland and in the
Manweb area was accepted on 3 March 2015 by Scottish Power Energy Networks and came
into force on 1 April 2015. An appeal made to the CMA by British Gas Trading Ltd, alleging that
the controls are too generous, was determined by the CMA on 29 September 2015, rejecting
most of the British Gas appeal, but a small adjustment was allowed, which affected the prices
set for 2016/17 and later years. The net effect on Scottish Power’s distribution licensees is a
revenue reduction of GBP 19 million over the 8 years RIIO ED1 period. The parallel appeal by
NPG had no impact on the Scottish Power licenses.

OFGEM has brought forward proposals for competitively tendering the construction of large,
new and separable transmission projects. This may lead to a few transmission developments
being taken forward by others.

3. Other issues
Other key elements of the regulatory regime in the United Kingdom include:
The Renewables Obligation (RO)

The United Kingdom Government intends to source 30% of electricity from renewable sources
by 2020. To this end, the RO Orders (which apply separately to different parts of the United
Kingdom within a unified scheme) place obligations on suppliers of electricity to source an
increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources (based on the expected level of
renewable energy production in each year plus a 10 per cent spread in order to prevent
certificate prices from falling sharply). Suppliers meet their obligations by presenting sufficient
Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) or by paying an equivalent amount into a fund.

The proceeds of the fund are paid back to those suppliers that have presented ROCs in
proportion to the number of ROCs presented. Since April 2009, the RO has been banded so
that differing technologies receive different levels of support depending on the expected costs.
The revision of this framework concluded in 2012 and, as a result, projects starting after 1 April
2013 (or later for some technologies) will receive revised levels of support.

The RO will close for new projects no later than 31 March 2017 and it will be replaced by a new
help system based in Contracts for differences (CFDs) that is part of the Electricity Market
Reform (EMR). For solar photovoltaic generation plants above SMW, the RO closed in April
2015. The Government has also proposed to close the RO in April 2016 for onshore wind and
solar photovoltaic plants at 5 MW or below, in both cases subject to grace periods. The RO will
remain in place for facilities entering the scheme before the relevant closure date; payments will
continue until 31 March 2027 for projects that started generation before 1 April 2009 and for 20
years after entry into the RO for later projects. The Energy Act 2013 envisages changing the
RO in due course to payment of a premium on substantially similar terms.

Electricity Market Reform

The United Kingdom Government's EMR programme was substantially implemented during
2014. The principal elements are:

- anew incentive scheme, based on CFDs to support low carbon generation; and
-  acapacity mechanism to support security of supply (market-wide auction mechanism).

The CFD allocations will take place within the constraints of a budget for low carbon support
measures known as the Levy Control Framework (LCF). An initial tranche of contracts were
approved during 2014 by the United Kingdom Government as part of a transitional “Final
Investment Decision Enabling Process”. The first allocation round took place on 4 February
2015 in two “pots”; one for established technologies (mainly onshore wind and solar) and a
second one for less established technologies (mainly offshore wind). Scottish Power’s 714 MW
East Anglia ONE offshore Wind Farm achieved a contract in the auction at a price of GBP 119
per MWh.

Annual capacity mechanism auctions took place in December 2014 and 2015, for capacity
delivery in winter 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The auctions cleared at prices of GBP
19.40 per kW/year.

Revised figures for spending under the LCF were published on 25 November 2015 alongside
the Autumn Statement. These indicated that the available funds to the end of the decade were
projected to be overspent. While the announcements on early closure of the Renewables
Obligation and other measures can be expected to limit costs, the Government has not at this
stage come forward with revised projections that take these policy changes into account.
Further details on the future levels of the LCF are likely to be published in 2016.

EU-ETS and United Kingdom Carbon Price Support

As in all EU Member States, generators in the United Kingdom participate in the EU-ETS. Since
2013, the Government is required to auction all allocations to the power sector. The Climate
Change Act 2008 set out a trajectory towards reducing CO, emissions from 1990 levels by at
least 80% by 2050, with interim reduction targets. The Carbon Price Support mechanism is a
United Kingdom tax imposed on fossil fuels used for electricity generation at differential rates
which simulate a charge on the CO, emissions. It was intended to smooth the path of carbon
prices in the United Kingdom power sector in the event of instability in the EU-ETS, by topping
up the EU-ETS price to a pre-set trajectory. In practice, the EU-ETS price is much lower than
expected and in order to mitigate the impact on electricity prices, the United Kingdom
Government has capped the Carbon Price Support tax at GBP 18 per tonne CO, until at least
2020.

Climate Change Levy (CCL) exemption

As announced in summer budget 2015 the exemption for renewable electricity from the Climate
Change Levy (a tax on non-domestic electricity users) ended on 1 August 2015. This has
removed a small additional revenue stream for renewable generators though its value was
expected to decline in any event around 2020.

The Energy Companies Obligation (ECO)

Energy suppliers who supply over 250,000 domestic customers are required to achieve energy
efficiency improvements among their customers. As with any other cost, the costs of making
those improvements can be factored by suppliers into tariffs, subject to the need to remain
competitive in the market. ECO ran from 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2015. A separate phase
runs from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2017. The Government has said that from April 2017, ECO
will be replaced by a cheaper scheme costing GBP 640 million a year. Details are yet to be
announced.

Coal closure

In November 2015, Secretary of State Amber Rudd announced plans to consult on
requirements for all coal power stations without CCS to close by 2025. The detail of any
proposed measures here is not available yet, but the impact on Scottish Power is assessed to
be limited, given the planned closure of Longannet.

Pollution Control

The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), the Large Combustion Plant Directive
(LCPD) and the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) cover the regulatory regime for controlling
the pollution from certain industrial activities, including thermal combustion generation, and
impose limits on various categories of emissions. In particular, the LCPD limits the emission of
sulphur dioxide (SO), oxides of nitrogen (NO,) and particles from power stations, whereby
operators of such plant had the option of meeting those requirements or accepting a limited
hour derogation prior to closure by the end of 2015. The IED puts in place a similar regime for
2016 and beyond, with more stringent standards. The IED is transposed into United Kingdom
law through the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2012 and amendments
to the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. These controls are
enforced by the Environment Agency or, in Scotland, the Scottish Environmental Protection
Agency.

4.2 Industry regulation in USA
1. Electricity and natural gas distribution

Some of the most important specific regulatory processes that affect Iberdrola USA Networks,
Inc. (hereinafter, IBERDROLA USA NETWORKS) include the Maine distribution tariff
stipulation, the Maine transmission Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Return on
Equity (ROE) case, Reforming Energy Vision (REV) of New York.

The revenues of IBERDROLA USA NETWORKS are essentially regulated, being based on
tariffs established in accordance with administrative procedures set by the various regulatory
bodies. The tariffs applied to regulated activities in the United States are approved by the
regulatory commissions of the different states and are based on the cost of providing service.
The revenues of each regulated utility are set to be sufficient to cover all its operating costs,
including energy costs, finance costs and the costs of equity, the last one reflects the
Company's capital ratio and the reasonable return on equity.

Energy costs that are set on the New York and New England wholesale markets are passed on
to consumers. The difference between energy costs that are budgeted for and those that are
actually incurred by the utilities is offset by applying compensation procedures that result in
either immediate or deferred tariff adjustments. These procedures apply to other costs, which
are in most cases exceptional (effects of extreme weather conditions, environmental factors,
regulatory and accounting changes, treatment of vulnerable customers, etc.) that are offset in
the tariff process. Any delivery profit from New York that means a service company exceeds its
profitability objectives (usually due to a better than expected cost efficiency), is shared among
the service company and its clients, resulting in a decrease in the future tariff.

Each of the six supply companies in IBERDROLA USA NETWORKS, must comply with
regulatory procedures that differ in form but in all cases conform to the basic framework outlined
above. As a general rule, tariff reviews cover various years (three in New York) and provide for
reasonable returns on equity, protection and automatic adjustments for exceptional costs
incurred and efficiency incentives.

1.1 Maine
Central Maine Power (CMP) Distribution rate stipulation

On 1 May 2013, CMP submitted its required distribution rate request to the Maine Public Utilities
Commission (PUC). After a 14-month review process, on 3 July 2014, CMP filed a rate
stipulation agreement on the majority of the financial matters with the PUC. The stipulation
agreement was approved by the PUC on 25 August 2014. The stipulation agreement also noted
that certain tariff design matters would be litigated, which was ruled on by the PUC on 14
October 2014.

The tariff stipulation agreement provided for an annual CMP distribution tariff increase of 10.7%
(USD 24.3 million). The rate increase was based on a 9.45% ROE and 50% equity capital. CMP
was authorized to implement a Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM) which protects CMP
from variations in sales due to energy efficiency and weather. CMP also adjusted its storm costs
recovery mechanism whereby it is allowed to collect in tariffs a storm allowance and to defer
actual storm costs when such storm events exceed USD 3.5 million. CMP and customers share
on a 50/50 basis the storm costs that exceed a certain balance, with CMP’s exposure limited to
USD 3 million annually. Storm costs and RDM adjustments are reconciled annually and tariff
rates are adjusted accordingly to recover or return adjustment balances.

234


--- Page 51 ---

CMP’s distribution stipulation provided for a separate regulatory filing for a new customer billing
system replacement. In accordance with the stipulation agreement, a new billing system is
needed and CMP made its filing on 27 February 2015 and is requesting a separate rate
recovery mechanism. On 20 October 2015, the PUC issued an order approving a stipulation
agreement authorizing CMP to proceed with the customer billing system investment. The
approved stipulation allows CMP to recover the system costs effective with its implementation
(currently expected in mid-2017).

The tariff stipulation does not have a pre-determined tariff term; CMP has the option to file for
new distribution tariffs at its own discretion.

The tariff stipulation does not contain service quality targets or penalties and the rate stipulation
also does not contain any earning sharing requirements.

Transmission — FERC ROE proceeding

CMP’s transmission tariffs are determined by a tariff regulated by the FERC and administered
by ISO New England (ISO-NE). Transmission rates are set annually pursuant to a FERC
authorized formula that allows for recovery of direct and allocated transmission operating and
maintenance expenses, as well as the return on assets invested. Prior to 16 October 2014, the
FERC provided a base return on equity (ROE) of 11.14% and additional ROE incentives
applicable to assets based upon vintage, voltage and other factors.

Complaint I: In September 2011, the Massachusetts Attorney general filed a complaint
with the FERC saying that the New England transmission ROE was too high and should
be lowered by 1.94%, to a value of 9.2%. On 16 October 2014, the FERC issued an
order in the ROE case which concluded:

+ The “base” ROE was set at 10.57% effective since 16 October 2014.

+ There is a ROE cap on total ROE (base ROE plus incentive ROEs) of 11.74%, also
effective since 16 October 2014.

+ FERC changed its DCF approach from a single-step to a two-step. FERC
determined that the long-term growth rate used in the two-step discounted cash
flow analysis should be the gross domestic product deflator estimated at 4.39%.
This aspect of their decision results from the “paper hearing” that FERC initiated in
its June 2014 decision.

+ During 2014 and 2015, CMP provided refunds for the period from October 2011 to
December 2012 with a base ROE of 10.57% and an ROE cap of 11.74%.

Complaint Il: Filed on 27 December 2012. On 19 June 2014, the FERC issued an
order setting this case for settlement and hearing, and set the refund effective date as
of 27 December 2012.

+ The parties entered settlement negotiations which ended in late October 2014 when
the parties were unable to reach agreement.

+ Hearings before a FERC Administrative Court took place between 25 June 2015

and 2 July 2015. FERC delayed the timetable but it still expects to make its final
decision by 3Q 2016.

235


--- Page 52 ---

Complaint Ill: Filed in August 2014, reiterates the same position as in Complaint II.
FERC consolidated Complaints II and III (see Complaint II for information).

CMP reserved for refunds in 2013 and 2014. The 2013 reserve was USD 6.6 million associated
with Complaint |. In 2014, CMP recorded an additional reserve of USD 29.9 million associated
with Complaints |, II, and III.

1.2 New York

New York State Electric & Gas Corporation (NYSEG) and Rochester Gas and Electric
Corporation (RG&E) Tariff Plans:

On 16 September 2010, the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) approved a new
tariff plan for electric and natural gas service provided by the companies effective between 26
August 2010 and 31 December 2013. The tariff plans contained continuation provisions beyond
2013 if NYSEG and RG&E did not request new tariffs to come into effect, in which case the then
current base tariffs would stay in place.

The revenue requirements were based on a 10% allowed ROE applied to an equity ratio of
48%. If annual earnings exceed the allowed return, a tiered Earnings Sharing Mechanism
(ESM) would capture a portion of the excess for the benefit of customers. The ESM is subject to
specified downward adjustments if the companies fail to meet certain reliability and customer
service measures. Key components of the tariff plan include electric reliability performance
mechanisms, natural gas safety performance measures, customer service quality metrics and
targets, and electric distribution vegetation management programmes that established threshold
performance targets. There will be downward revenue adjustments if the companies fail to meet
the targets. The companies met all of the service quality targets through 2014 but missed a
customer service metric in 2015 due to severe weather in February 2015.

The 2010 rate plans established Revenue Decoupling Mechanisms (RDM) intended to remove
company disincentives to promote increased energy efficiency. Under the RDM, electric
revenues are based on revenue per customer class rather than billed revenue, while natural gas
revenues are based on revenue per customer. Any shortfalls (excesses) between billed
revenues and allowed revenues will be accrued for future recovery (refund).

2015 NY Rate Filings

On 20 May 2015, NYSEG and RG&E filed electric and gas rate cases with the NYPSC. The
companies are requesting rate increases for NYSEG Electric, NYSEG Gas and RG&E Gas,
while for RG&E Electric are requesting rate decreases.

NYSEG Electric is requesting USD 126 million (7% overall) in additional annual delivery
revenue to recover prior storm costs, move to a full cycle vegetation management trim
programme in line with best industry practice, and earn an adequate return on its investment.
RG&E Electric is proposing a USD 10 million rate decrease (1% overall) reflecting the return to
customers of funds collected during its 2010 rate plan associated with management efficiencies
and costs lower than set levels. NYSEG Gas and RG&E Gas are requesting additional
revenues of USD 38 million (8% overall) and USD 20 million (5% overall), respectively.

The companies are requesting a 10.06% return on equity and a 50% equity ratio. The rate

filings are for one year but the companies have indicated their interest in pursuing a multi-year
settlement.

236


--- Page 53 ---

The NYPSC Staff and other parties filed testimony in September 2015 opposing the rate
increase requests. The NYPSC Staff proposed a delivery increase of USD 11.8 million for
NYSEG electric and delivery rate decreases for RG&E Electric of USD 23.4 million, delivery
decrease of USD 2.8 million for NYSEG gas and a delivery decrease of USD 2.9 million for
RG&E gas. The NYPSC proposed an 8.7% ROE and a 48% equity ratio. NYPSC also proposed
to offset the NYSEG electric storm deferral balance of USD 262 million with excess depreciation
reserve amounts which NYPSC Staff claims is USD 665 million at NYSEG Electric and USD
129 million at RG&E Electric. The NYPSC stated it was open to discussing a multi-year rate
plan for the companies.

Other parties including the Division of Consumer Protection, Utility Intervention Unit, the New
York State Office of General Services, Multiple Intervenors, Nucor Steel Auburn, Ince., Pace
Energy and Climate Center, WalMart Stores, Upstate New York Laborers’ District Council,
Greenidge Generation, LLC and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 10
also filed direct and responsive testimony opposing certain aspects of the companies’ rate
requests.

In October 2015, the companies filed rebuttal testimony opposing the NYPSC Staff's
adjustments including their proposal to offset deferred storm costs with excess depreciation
reserve values. The companies also updated their rate request values to USD 166 million for
the two electric businesses and USD 59 million for the gas businesses.

In October 2015, the parties agreed to commence settlement negotiations. The companies
agreed to extend the suspension period through August 2016 in order for settlement
discussions to take place. The companies’ suspension agreement was subject to a make-whole
provision. Settlement negotiations have occurred since October and have continued into
February 2016.

The companies are unable to predict the outcome of the proceeding but would expect any
decision to occur by the second quarter of 2016.

Reforming the Energy Vision:

April 2014, the NYPSC commenced a proceeding titled Reforming the Energy Vision (REV),
which is an initiative to reform New York State’s energy industry and regulatory practices. REV
has followed several simultaneous paths: Track 1 deals with market design and platform
technology and Track 2 deals with the regulatory reform. REV’s objectives include the
promotion of more efficient use of energy, increasing the utilization of renewable energy
resources such as wind and solar power (in support of New York State’s renewable energy
goals) and a wider deployment of “distributed” energy resources, such as micro-grids, in-situ
power supplies, and storage.

Track 1 of this initiative involves the examination of the role that distributors will have in the
enablement of market-based deployment of distributed energy resources to promote load
management, system efficiency, and peak load reductions. NYSEG and RG&E are participating
in all aspects of the REV initiative with other New York utilities, as well as providing their unique
prospective. NYPSC Staff has conducted public statement hearings across New York State
regarding REV.

Other REV-related proceedings have also been initiated by the NYPSC, each of which follow its
own schedule. These proceedings include the Clean Energy Fund, Demand Response Tariffs,
Community Choice Aggregation, Large Scale Renewables, and Community Distributed
Generation.

237


--- Page 54 ---

Track 2 of the REV initiative is also under development, and through a NYPSC Staff's
Whitepaper review process, is examining potential changes in current regulation, tariff, market
design and incentive structures which could better align utility interests with achieving New York
State’s and NYPSC’s objectives. New York’s utilities will also be addressing related regulatory
issues in their individual rate cases.

Reliability Support Service Agreement in the Ginna Nuclear Power Plant

The Ginna Nuclear Power Plant (GNPP), which is a subsidiary of Constellation Energy Nuclear
Group, LLC (CENG), owns and operates the R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, a 581 MW
single-unit pressurised water reactor located in Ontario, New York. In May 2014, the NYISO did
a reliability study, confirming that the Ginna Facility needs to remain in operation to avoid bulk
transmission and non-bulk local distribution system reliability violations in 2015 and 2018.

On 11 July 2014, GNPP filed a petition requesting that the NYPSC would initiate a proceeding
to examine a proposal for the continued operating. Ginna asserted that in the two preceding
years (i.e., 2012 and 2013), it had sustained cumulative losses of nearly USD 100 million
(including the allocation of CENG corporate overhead) and that “CENG has not been
compensated for any operational risk or an appropriate return on its investment over this
period.” Based on the results of the 2014 Reliability Study, GNPP requested that: 1) the NYPSC
determine that the continued operation of the Ginna Facility is required to preserve system
reliability; and 2) the NYPSC issue an Order directing RG&E to negotiate and file an RSSA for
the continued operation of the Ginna Facility.

In November 2014, the NYPSC ruled that GNPP had demonstrated that the Ginna Facility is
required to maintain system reliability and that its actions with respect to meeting the relevant
retirement notice requirements were satisfactory. The NYPSC also accepted the findings of the
2014 Reliability Study and stated that it established “the reliability need for continued operation
of the Ginna Facility that is the essential prerequisite to negotiating an RSSA.” As such, the
NYPSC ordered RG&E and GNPP to negotiate an RSSA.

On 13 February 2015, RG&E submitted to the NYPSC an executed Reliability Support Services
Agreement (RSSA) between RG&E and R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, LLC (GNPP). RG&E
requested that the NYPSC accept the RSSA and approve cost recovery by RG&E from its
customers of all amounts payable to GNPP under the RSSA utilising the cost recovery
surcharge mechanism.

On 21 October 2015, RG&E, Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, LLC, New York Department of Public
Service, Utility Intervention Unit and Multiple Inspectors filed a Joint Proposal with the NYPSC
for approval of the RSSA, as modified. The Joint Proposal provides a term of the RSSA from 1
April 2015 through 31 March 2017. RG&E shall make monthly payments to Ginna in the amount
of USD 15.42 million RG&E will be entitled to 70% of revenues from Ginna’s sales into the New
York Independent System Operator (“NYISO”) energy and capacity markets, while Ginna will be
entitled to 30% of such revenues. The signatory parties recommend that the NYPSC authorize
RG&E to implement a rate surcharge (referred to herein as the “rate surcharge” or “RSSA
surcharge”) effective 1 January 2016 to recover amounts paid to Ginna pursuant to the RSSA.
RG&E's payment obligation to Ginna shall not begin until the rate surcharge is in effect and
FERC has issued an order authorizing the agreement. RG&E will use deferred rate credit
amounts (regulatory liabilities) to offset the full amount of the Deferred Collection Amount
(including carrying costs), plus credit amounts to offset all RSSA costs that exceed USD 2.25
million per month, not to exceed a total use of credits in the amount of USD 110 million,
applicable through 30 June 2017. To the extent that the available credits are insufficient to
satisfy the final payment from RG&E to Ginna then the RSSA surcharge may continue past 31
March 2017 to recover up to USD 2.25 million per month until the final payment has been
recovered by RG&E from ratepayers. The commission has not ruled on the settlement
agreement and the companies expect a ruling in the second quarter 2016.

NY Transco

Subsidiaries of National Grid, Central Hudson and NYSEG/RG&E, along with an affiliate of Con
Edison and Orange and Rockland Utilities, are part of a new organization, New York Transco
LLC. New York Transco LLC is focused on developing electric transmission to meet future
electricity needs of all New Yorkers and will develop and New York transmission projects upon
receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.

NY Transco members are requesting regulatory approval for a group of transmission projects
expected to cost USD 1,700 million, with NYSEG/RG8&E allocated an equity contribution of USD
183 million over the period 2015 through 2018. Additional projects may be developed in the
future. Equity investments will be expressly contingent on receiving necessary regulatory
approvals and acceptable economic returns. The investment will be made through an lIberdrola
USA Networks subsidiary, Iberdrola USA Networks New York Transco, LLC, constituted on 3
November 2014.

NY Transco filed with FERC in early December 2014. The filing requests a formula base ROE of
10.6%, plus 150 basis points ROE incentives. The filing also requests recognition of
construction work in process, abandoned plant, regulatory asset for pre-commercial costs and
60% leverage for five years. Various parties, including the NYPSC, have protested the filing at
FERC. NY Transco anticipates a FERC decision in 2015.

On 2 April 2015, the FERC issued an order granting, inter alia, applicants’ request for a 50 basis
point adder for NY Transco’s membership in the New York Independent System Operator, Inc.
(“NYISO”), subject to the adder being capped within the zone of reasonableness after a
determination of where within that zone its base level ROE should be set. The Commission also
set the formula rate and base ROE issue for hearing and settlement judge procedures. In
addition, the FERC rejected the applicants’ cost allocation method for the TOTS Projects
because it would allocate costs to LIPA and NYPA that they did not voluntarily agree to pay.

After several months of negotiations, on 5 November 2015, applicants, on behalf of the settling
parties, filed the settlement with the FERC, which reflects the agreement of the settling parties
to resolve all outstanding issues associated with the TOTS Projects, including issues related to
the TOTS Projects that were set for hearing and issues pending on rehearing before the FERC
in file number ER15-572-000. The settling parties agreed that the FERC file number ER15-572-
000 shall remain open but held in abeyance with respect to the applicants’ AC Projects, as they
may be modified during the NYPSC/NYISO selection process. Within 30 days after the NYISO’s
viability and sufficiency assessment, the settling parties will agree in good faith on a date not
more than three months later to resume settlement negotiations in file number ER15-572-000 to
resolve the rates, terms, and conditions to be approved by the Commission for the applicants’
AC Projects. On or after that date, the applicants will file a new Section 205 filing to address the
cost allocation methodology to be applied to the AC Projects. The FERC is expected to rule on
the settlement in the first quarter of 2016.

2. Electricity generation from renewable energy resources

In the United States, numerous State Governments and the Federal Government have adopted
measures and implemented numerous regulations designed to foster the development of
electricity production from renewable resources. State programmes have generally come in the
form of: 1) Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPSs) that usually require utilities to generate or
purchase a minimum amount of renewable electricity; and 2) tax incentives. To date, the
Federal Government has primarily supported renewable energy development through tax
credits for production and investment as well as accelerated tax depreciation.

Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted mandatory RPS requirements,
which vary across the states but will generally range from 15-33% of the generation by 2025.
The requirements are typically implemented through a system of tradable renewable energy
certificates that verify that a kWh of electricity has been generated from a renewable resource.
Several state legislatures have debated whether to repeal or roll back significantly their RPS
requirements. In 2014 Ohio enacted legislation to freeze its RPS programme until 2017; in
2015, Kansas replaced its mandatory RPS with a 20% voluntary standard as part of a
compromise that retained existing property tax exemptions. In contrast, California in 2015
enacted legislation to increase the state RPS to 50%.

Most states also offer a variety of tax incentives to promote investment in renewable energy
resources. For instance, Washington and Colorado, among other states, exempt the sale and
use of renewable energy equipment from taxation, which reduces development costs
substantially. Several states reduce property tax requirements on renewable generation
facilities through enterprise zones or similar designations, while Minnesota has substituted a
property tax in lieu of fix production tax. Other states, such as Texas, boost the construction of
electrical infrastructure (Competitive Renewable Energy Zones) to ease the transportation of
renewable electricity towards load points.

In 1992, the US Congress enacted legislation that established a Production Tax Credit (PTC) of
USD 15 per MWh (adjusted for inflation) for the production of electricity from wind power
facilities for the first ten years of a project's operation. This programme has been renewed on
several occasions and has been expanded to include the production of electricity from several
other renewable resources, including biomass, geothermal, solid urban wastes and
hydroelectric power. In 2005, Congress established a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) for solar
power projects. The PTC, which is currently valued at USD 23 per MWh, was extended and
phased out by the Congress on 18 December. Developers that start construction on a wind
project before 2017 will qualify for the full credit, while those starting construction between 2017
and 2019 will qualify for a reduced-value credit. These qualifying facilities may also elect to
take a 30% ITC rather than the PTC. Solar ITC was also extended and phased out by Congress
on December 18. Developers that start construction on a solar project before 2020 will qualify
for a 30% investment tax credit (ITC). Projects for which construction begins after 2019 are
eligible for a lower ITC. The purposes of the PTC and ITC are to make electricity production
from renewable resources more competitive relative to fossil fuel and nuclear power facilities.

240


--- Page 57 ---

In addition to the PTC and ITC, renewable energy facilities are eligible for accelerated five-year
tax depreciation on their investments. This programme is known as the Modified Accelerated
Cost Recovery System. As a result of legislation enacted in 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2014, many
facilities placed in service between 2008 and 2014 qualified for bonus depreciation which
allowed 50% depreciation deduction in the year a facility was placed in service. On December,
Congress enacted legislation to extend and phase out bonus depreciation. Companies can
through 2017 deduct 50% of certain capital investments during the year the investment is made.
If the investment occurs in 2018, companies can deduct 40% and if it occurs in 2019 only 30%
of deduction is allowed.

With respect to interstate transmission networks, the FERC has adopted a series of
requirements on transmission operators to improve access and reduce costs for variable
generation like wind and solar power. FERC Order 764 is driving changes in scheduling
practices and other activities that will increase forecasting accuracy and reduce needed
reserves, resulting in lower technology integration costs.

3. Integration of UIL

4

he most important issue from a regulatory point of view has been the merger approval by the
competent authorities.

The merger took place on 16 December 2015 and from then until the end of the year there is
nothing to emphasize in regulatory matters.

4.3 Industry regulation in Mexico

The Mexican electric regulatory framework is currently under a deep transformation, due to the
energy reform that began at the end of 2013 with the amendment of the Mexican Constitution,
continued with the issuance of a set of new laws and rulings for hydrocarbons and electricity
ind is now at the level of regulatory provisions being issued thus transforming the energy sector
is a whole. Although the energy reform is aimed mainly at the hydrocarbons sector, it will also
ffer new business opportunities in the generation, transmission, distribution and management
electricity infrastructure. This transformation has the purpose of opening up the energy sector
to private investment in the activities that were previously reserved to the Government.

a
a
fe)

Activities like petroleum treatment and refinement; natural gas processing; exporting and
importing hydrocarbons and petroleum products; the transport, storage, distribution,
compression, liquefaction, decompression, re-gasification, marketing and sale to the public of
natural gas, hydrocarbons, petroleum products and petrochemicals, along with the management
of integrated systems are now open to private investment, and governed by the regulations the
Hydrocarbons Law.

As a consequence of this constitutional reform, nine new laws were enacted during 2014 and
2015 and 25 regulations were either created or reformed. Concurrently with the COP 21 in
Paris, the Mexican Congress and Senate passed the Energy Transition Law (Ley de Transicién
Energetica - LTE), which creates binding obligations for clean energy generation and emission
reductions targets for the future, which brings a strong legal framework to the development of
clean energy projects in Mexico.

Through transitory provisions, the previous regulatory framework will continue being applicable

to IBERDROLA’s existing businesses and facilities, which provides stability and legal certainty
in the Mexican regulatory context.

1. The Electric Reform

The Mexican Constitution, amended in December 2013, states that the planning and control of
the national electrical system, as well as the energy distribution and transmission public service
are competency of the Government of Mexico. Power generation, except for the nuclear one,
and its retail are opened to private investment.

Regarding the transmission and distribution network, the Mexican Government may grant
contracts to private companies to perform services, including owning and operating
infrastructure under the terms established by the Law.

The Electricity Industry Law (Ley de /a Industria Eléctrica - LIE) regulates activities in the
electricity sector in Mexico. According to the LIE, the private companies can now generate and
sell electricity under an organised Wholesale Electric Market, and also invest in transmission
and distribution infrastructure, under specific Public-Private Associations and other legal
structures described therein.

2. Energy Secretariat

As part of the Energy Reform, the Energy Secretariat (Secretaria de Energia - SENER) has
been empowered to coordinate the centralised planning and coordination of the energy policy,
both for hydrocarbon and electric subsectors. SENER is also in charge of guaranteeing the
implementation of the laws derived from the reform including the LTE issued recently for the
transition to clean energy and emission reduction.

During the first half of 2015, SENER issued the mandatory requirement of Renewable Energy
Certificates (RECs) for year 2018, with a target of 5% of the total consumption. During the
second half of 2015, SENER published the Wholesale Electric Market guidelines and called for
the first long term auction for RECs, capacity and energy, to be completed by the first half of
2016.

Regarding the coordination and planning of the national electric network, SENER issued the
National Electric Grid Development Programme (Programa de Desarrollo del Sector Eléctrico
Nacional - PRODESEN).

3. Regulatory Body

As part of the energy reform in Mexico, the country enacted the new regulatory bodies law in
August 2014 (the Regulatory Body Law) that established that the regulatory bodies in charge of
coordinating activities in the energy field are the National Hydrocarbons Commission (Comisién
Nacional de Hidrocarburos - CNH) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (Comisién
Reguladora de Energia - CRE).

By means of this law, the CRE and the CNH are granted the most power and authority as
regulatory bodies in the energy sector. They have their own legal status, as well as budgetary,
technical and governance autonomy. Both commissions have a similar governance authority of
seven commissioners and an executive secretary.

The CNH and the CRE hold substantial power and authority over the hydrocarbons and
electricity industry regulation.

CRE has existed since 1995 as a public body with power and authority to grant permits and
publish administrative provisions in the fields of electricity, gas transport and some regulated
tariffs for natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas.

As a result of the Energy Reform, the CRE’s powers were increased significantly to

transportation and commercialisation of hydrocarbon and derivatives, such as gasoline, petrol,
diesel fuel oil, etc.

242


--- Page 59 ---

Regarding the electricity sector, CRE regulates the issuance of future changes to the MEM;
defines the terms and conditions of auctions and bidding processes; supervises the MEM
operation; SENER develops the first bases rules the transactions between generators and
energy providers; authorises the contract and auction models; regulates reliability, capacity
requirements and operational costs; determines the regulated tariffs and contract models for
services involving transmission, distribution and basic supply of electricity, authorises models
related to technical specifications for connecting power stations and users, intelligent networks,
etc. Other roles of CRE include granting permits to market participant and RECs registry,
resolution of controversies and enforcing fines related to non-compliance of market participants.

Regarding the hydrocarbon sector, the CRE regulates and promotes the development of
transportation, storage, distribution, compression, liquefaction and regasification activities. It
must also supply the public with fuel, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, oil wells,
petrochemicals as well as the transmission through pipelines, storage, distribution and supply of
renewable energies to the public.

The CNH has the fundamental objective of regulating and supervising the exploration and
extraction of hydrocarbons. It is responsible for the promotion, tendering and undersigning of
contracts for this activity.

4. National Agency for Energy Control (CENACE)

Mexico has created the National Agency for Energy Control (Centro Nacional de Control de
Energia - CENACE) as a decentralised public body with authority to perform the operational
control of the national electricity grid and the Wholesale Electric Market. CENACE has full
autonomy and acts under the authority of SENER and CRE, in order to control the participation
of generators and suppliers in the market, acquire and provide electricity and capacity under
competitive basis, summon and manage the auctions of capacity, energy and RECs.

CENACE guarantees open access to the transmission and distribution facilities to all market
participants, public and private.

CENACE also operates and oversees the preparation of proposals for planning and expansion
of the entire national electricity grid through its development programme (PRODESEN), which is
then supervised and issued by SENER and thereafter by CRE.

During the first half of 2015, CENACE received from CFE all the relevant assets related to its
roles, issued its internal organisational by-laws, delivered the draft of the PRODESEN to
SENER and issued the first version of interconnection criteria.

During the second half of 2015, CENACE issued de bidding package for the first long term
auction for capacity, RECs and clean energy.

5. CFE’s Law

The CFE’s Law, issued in August 2014, states that CFE becomes a productive state-owned
production company wholly owned by the Federal Government. The new CFE has budgetary
and governance autonomy, with Board of Directors formed by members of the incumbent
secretariats (SENER, Hacienda, etc...) and independent board members. This law aims to
regulate the organisation, administration, operation, control, evaluation and accountability of
CFE and to establish the special regime for productive enterprises subsidiaries and
subsidiaries, compensations, acquisitions, leases, services and works, assets, liabilities, state
dividend, budget and debt.

243


--- Page 60 ---

During the first half of 2016, the CFE is expected to undergo a legal separation of its generation,
transmission, distribution and sales activities so that other parties will have open access to the
grid and levelled play roles for the wholesale electricity market.

6. Transmission and Distribution

As per the LIE, the Mexican Government will continue performing the transmission and
distribution activities (“T&D”) for electricity as a strategic regulated public service through state-
owned production companies (EPE) or their subsidiaries. CFE’s legal separation will allow it to
create these entities as regulated open access companies. The LIE provides opportunity for
T&D activities and related services to be subcontracted with private companies through public-
private agreements, so that financing, installation, maintenance, management, operation,
expansion, rehabilitation, surveillance and preservation of the required infrastructure can be
performed as services provided to the T&D regulated companies.

7. Generation and Retail

The LIE provides that generation and retail can be performed by any private or public entities
subject to the compliance of permitting and market rules. Generation plants 0.5 MW or larger
require a permit from the CRE.

The LIE provides that electric retail requires a permit and may have two modes: 1- basic supply
with regulated tariff (for those consumers with a lower demand of 1 MW from August 2016) or 2-
qualified supply through the wholesale electricity market at liberalized conditions for consumers
with a demand of 1 MW or more.

SENER may revise and reduce the threshold of 1 MW for the possibility of qualifying consumers
for the liberalised conditions. However, becoming a qualified consumer is optional and only
mandatory for new costumers.

8. Geothermal energy

The Geothermal Energy Law and its corresponding ruling regulate the exploration and use of
underground geothermal resources to generate electricity. The private sector can participate
through auctions to obtain exploitation rights of geothermal resources. Additionally, the National
Water Law was also amended in order to provide special status to the “geothermal water”
compatibly with the Geothermal Energy Law.

9. Wholesale electricity market
The LIE foresees the creation of the Wholesale Electric Market where generators and suppliers
can interact to buy and sale the energy, capacity, ancillary services, CECs and financial
transmission rights according to market rules. CENACE will operate this market and control the
national electricity grid.

CENACE will determine the transaction prices based on the bids and offers it receives within
the market. Energy prices will be nodal and marginal.

Finally, the wholesale electricity markets started at the end of January 2016.

244


--- Page 61 ---

10. National content

The LIE will not demand a minimum percentage of national content. However, it points out that
SENER will establish the minimum percentages and other conditions for national content in
terms of contracts it generates. The Treasury Secretary will establish the criteria to measure the
level of domestic content in the electricity sector.

11. Surface use and occupancy

The LIE provides that transmission and distribution, being for public service, must be treated as
strategic activities in terms of rights of way. This allows greater access to the facilities and
tights of way to the national electricity grid. The CRE will issue provisions that will secure
access to the power lines and fair compensation to the land owners.

12. Previous regime for permits, centrals and electric industry contracts

All the permits and contracts granted and executed under the repealed Public Power Service
Law (Ley del Servicio Publico de Energia Eléctrica - LSPEE) will remain under the same terms
and conditions, and can be amended as provided there. Once the MEM starts operating, the
holders of these legacy contracts - self supply and Independent Power Producers (“IPP”) will
have the alternative to migrate partially or completely to the new LIE, provided that the existing
IPP will remain in effect to the end of their contractual term prior to the migration and that
Legacy Connection Contracts (Contratos de Interconexién Legados - CIL) of the self-supply
projects will not be renewed upon their termination.

Permit requests for self-supply, co-generation, small-scale production, imports or exports made
before august 2014 will be resolved under the LSPEE terms and conditions, provided that their
facilities must start operating before 31 December 2019.

13. Electricity tariffs

Since 2016, the CRE will assume the responsibility of issuing the regulated electricity tariffs
(transport, distribution, basic supply and last reserve supply). Tariffs will be based on the
recovery of generation costs, connection services, transport and distribution costs, clean energy
certificates and other recoverable costs and collection targets. It is expected that these tariffs
will use the same or similar formulas as the previous regime during a transitory period from
2016 to 2018. The adjustments starting in 2016 will be based primarily on the legal separation
of CFE entities and the contracts for basic supply based on regulated profitability of CFE
subsidiaries. As the main mechanism to promote the reduction of non-technical losses arising
from customer's fraud, CRE will impose collection targets on the distribution companies.

14. Natural Gas Transportation System

As part of the Energy Reform, the former owner of the Natural Gas Transportation System,
PEMEX, has been split in the following subsidiaries: Pemex exploration and production, Pemex
industrial transformation, Pemex perforation, Pemex logistics, Pemex co-generation and
services, Pemex fertilisers and Pemex ethylene, as provided under the PEMEX Law enacted in
August 2014.

This law transformed PEMEX into a state-owned production company which performs business
activities and aims to profitability goals.

245


--- Page 62 ---

Concurrently with this transformation, the natural gas transportation system has been
transferred from PEMEX to CENAGAS, the National Operator of the Natural Gas Pipeline Grid
in order to promote an open market for transportation, distribution and commercialisation of the
gas. According to the principle of asymmetrical regulation, PEMEX cannot integrate
transportation and commercialisation of gas under the same company anymore.

CENAGAS has issued the 5 year strategic natural gas development programme. As part of this
programme, and in order to promote the reduction of fuel oil consumption, CFE has called for
several bidding processes to contract natural gas transportation service from pipelines to be
owned by private companies. It is expected that the vast majority of these pipelines will be
operational by 2018, thus increasing the natural gas fired power generation, and reducing CO,
emissions from the fuel oil based generation. Simultaneously, the Government is promoting
multiple gas pipelines intended to expand the existing gas transportation system through
CENAGAS.

The natural gas transport and storage systems incorporated into the new integrated tariff
scheme must meet the criteria of forming part of an interconnected system, thus providing
benefits, improving the safety, continuity, redundancy levels and efficiency of integrated
systems.

The legacy transportation permits (permits given before the electric reform) for self-supply and
the long term natural gas supply contracts with Pemex required by the electric plants will remain
in effect and will not be adversely affected by these changes in the regulatory framework.

4.4 Industry regulation in Brazil
1. Tariffs

Electricity distribution activity carried out by joint ventures, such as Companhia de Eletricidade
do Estado da Bahia, S.A. (COELBA), Companhia Eletricidade do Rio Grande do Norte, S.A.
(COSERN), Companhia Energética de Pernambuco, S.A (CELPE) and Elektro Electricidade e
Servicos, S.A. (ELEKTRO), which operate in Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul, is subjected
to federal regulation in Brazil.

The Brazilian regulatory framework is based on a system of price cap that is revised every four
or five years, depending on each company’s concession contract and is updated annually by
the regulator. COELBA and COSERN have a five-year term and CELPE and ELEKTRO have a
four-year term.

Tariffs are updated annually by the National Energy Agency (Agéncia Nacional de Energia
Elétrica - ANEEL), through the annual adjustment process that considers inflation, an ex-ante
efficiency factor and variations on non-manageable costs components, such as energy
purchase costs and transmission tolls.

Tariffs have two components:

e Component A: corresponding to energy purchases, power transmission services
contracts and to other costs that are out of a distributor company administration and
passed through to the end tariff.

e Component B: determined as the sum of (i) the return on the non-depreciated
regulatory remuneration base (regulatory WACC applied to the replacement cost of
non-depreciated distribution installations and other assets), (ii) the return on capital (a
depreciation index applied to the gross asset base) and (iii) the operation and
maintenance expenses, and the expense for the uncollectible turnover (the regulator
defines late payment rates depending on the kind of grant). This last subcomponent is
calculated through a benchmarking model which compares all power distributors in the
country and determinates efficient cost levels.

246


--- Page 63 ---

In June 2014, ANEEL opened the first debate on the fourth cycle of tariff review in a public
hearing, discussing proposals to change the methodology used to calculate operating costs,
cost of capital (WACC), regulatory asset base (RAB), along with uncollectable revenues and
distribution losses.

In May 2015, methodologies dealing with Fourth Tariff Review Cycle were approved and
applied to ELEKTRO in its tariff review in August 2015. The main points, in summary, are:

e WACC: approved regulatory WACC for Fourth Cycle is 8.09% real after taxes. This is
higher than Third Cycle’s 7.5%.

e OPEX: The OPEX to be used in the first year of the cycle was confirmed and
represents a positive margin to efficient companies.

e Non-technical losses: In the case of efficient companies, the target will be defined by
the historical average instead of the historical minimum.

e Uncollectable revenues: benchmarking approach defines the uncollectable, wherein it
is used the bad debt database of 49-60 months. Pass through of uncollectable
revenues related to sector fees and tariff flags revenues. The result represented an
improvement from what was proposed.

e Third-party assets (special obligations): inclusion of a fee to operate third-party
assets. This is an important improvement compared with previous cycles.

e X Factor: The approved X factor for the sector is 1.53% (versus 1.91% from ANEEL’s
first proposal).

e Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) and Non-Electrical Assets: The new methodology for
RAB was not applied in ELEKTRO’s review but will be applied to NEOENERGIA’s
distribution companies. According to the new methodology, the values of assets’
additional costs and minor components are now given by a reference price database.
Also, Non-Electrical Assets’ methodology had a data update and it is expected to better
reflect companies’ costs.

On 25 August 2015, ANEEL approved ELEKTRO’s Fourth tariff review, which raised its tariffs in
4.2% on average (0.68% for residential clients and 9.32% for industrial clients). Some highlights
of Fourth Cycle are: all investments made were recognized in the RAB, higher remuneration
rate (from 7.5% to 8.09%, after taxes), positive OPEX margins, third party asset’s remuneration
and smaller x Factor.

The aim of the annual review is to ensure that component A’s costs are passed on to
consumers and that component B’s costs perform in line with inflation and with the pre-
determined efficiency factor. An annual tracking account mechanism is used to register
component A’s unbalances, which should be passed through to tariffs in the following tariff
process.

Also regarding distributors’ financial exposure due to a rise in costs in early 2015, an
extraordinary tariff review occurred in order to preserve financial and economical balance.

247

2. Energy Purchase

For the business of power generation, the review of the sector model introduced in 2004
brought new guidelines for planning responsibilities and expansion generation fleet, significantly
reducing risk of further rationing. This expansion is being pursued via public tendering of
generation projects in which the successful bidder is the supplier that offers the lowest price in
Brazilian Reais per MWh generated, in exchange the successful bidder is awarded a
concession or permit of 20 to 35 years (depending on the technology) to operate a power
station under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) at a price that is an outcome of the tender.

Since 2013, Brazil has undergone some important structural changes in electricity regulation.

In Law 12.783 (the former Provisional Act 579) of 11 January 2013, the Federal Government
made official a decrease in electricity tariffs (which led to an extraordinary tariff revision applied
on 24 January 2013) and established standards for the renewal of concessions for generation,
transmission and distribution expiring between 2015 and 2017. This law allowed power
companies to extend their concessions by early renewal of their contracts under specific
conditions. As a result of these new rules some generators decided not to renew their
concessions. The energy from generators that decided to renew concessions was allocated to
Distribution System Operators (DSOs) through quotas, which, however, were not sufficient to
meet market needs. Additionally, some PPAs from new energy auctions were suspended or
postponed due to delay of construction schedules or revocation by ANEEL.

Thus, mismatches between energy requirements (load) and resources (PPAs) led DSOs to
purchase energy in the spot market, raising their costs and significantly affecting their cash flow.
In addition, hydrologic conditions have been unfavourable since the final quarter of 2012, with
low reservoir levels together with poor performance of rainfalls and inflows, which increased
substantially the spot price and thermoelectric generation. The corollary was a significant
increase in energy costs, which temporarily impacted earnings of distributors.

Part of this rise in costs was compensated for using funds managed by Government through
energy development account and by means of loans underwritten by various financial
institutions, centralised in ACR (Account for Regulated Environment) Accounts. These
resources were approximately BRL 10 billion to cover non-recurring expenses incurred in 2013
and BRL 18.8 billion to cover those during 2014. The remaining part of non-recurring costs,
which wasn’t covered by these funds, was passed through to consumers in the annual
adjustment of the tariffs.

These financial resources helped to minimise distributors’ liquidity problems in 2013 and 2014,
but according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), DSOs were not allowed to
recognise regulatory assets and liabilities on their balance sheets. ANEEL therefore opened
Public Hearing 61/2014 to discuss whether distributors' concession agreements should be
amended allowing the compensation of regulatory assets and liabilities at the end of the
concession period, in order to allow its recognition in the distributors’ financial statements. This
amendment was signed by distributors in November 2014, and these assets and liabilities are
presently recognised according to IFRS.

During Public Hearing 64/2014, ANEEL discussed quotas allocation criterion, regarding the
energy from generators whose concessions had expired. Federal Decree 7805/2012
established the allocation of new energy quotas in conformity with the size of the market (except
the allocation that happened in 2013, which didn’t follow this guideline in order to achieve equal
tariff reductions between DSOs). As a result, ANEEL approved an allocation criterion that
favours exposure to the spot market in 2015 but that follows the proportion of market size in the
following years.

248


--- Page 65 ---

In 2015, minimum and maximum limits for spot prices were changed, after discussion within the
Public Hearing, these values went from BRL 15.62 and BRL 822.83 per MWh in 2014 to BRL
30.26 and BRL 388.48 per MWh respectively. This change allowed a significant reduction in the
exposure of DSOs’ cash flows.

On 15 May 2015, MME (Ministry of Mines and Energy) instructed ANEEL to promote auction for
bidding 29 hydroelectric concessions located in the states of Goias, Parana, Sao Paulo, Minas
Gerais and Santa Catarina. The Provisional Measure 688 was published in August and
established a “bonus” for the generation’s grant to be pay to Federal Union by the winning
bidder of each lot of power plants. By signing the contract, concessionaire shall receive in its
Annual Revenue Generation (RAG) a portion of bonus grant’s return.

The auction was held on 25 November, and the biggest buyer agent was China Three Gorges,
which successfully bid the plants Jupia and Ilha Solteira. The auction had an average discount
of 0.32% and the average price was BRL 125 MWh, without the additional costs of connection
and fees. Government collected through bonus for the generation grant BRL 17 billion. The
quotas average price has increased in relation to the practiced prior to the auction, given the
incorporation of bonus grant’s return in the revenue of generators.

After great tensions related to the lack of rainfall in 2014 and early 2015 (which raised the
imminent possibility of rationing), storage reservoirs, especially in Southeast and Midwest, were
able to recover and close the month of November at 27.55% of capacity, well above the
recorded for the same period of 2014. The year's closing forecast is 33.8% of its capacity.

Despite improved hydrological conditions, economic slowdown observed for three consecutive
quarters had significant negative effects on the distribution market. Given that prospects for
2016 are a negative growth of Brazilian GDP, it is expected that the decline in the energy
sector's market continues, especially affected by the drop in industrial demand. Thus, the
distributors are facing a plausible scenario of overcontracting (above 105%) for the next year.
By December 2013, all energy contracts for the year 2016 had already been carried out with
completely different projections of the ones checked today, and therefore variations on events
outside the managerial scope of distribution combined with unfavorable market conditions have
resulted in overcontracting (despite the Company's efforts to mitigate them). The main factors
responsible for this scenario are the quotas, migration of potentially free and special customers
to free market and other variations resulting from higher market fall than frustration of the
energy auctions. Once DSOs have identified difficulties, negotiations have started with MME
and ANEEL to counteract the unmanageable effects and neutralize the risks.

249

3. Other Regulatory Changes

On 29 December 2014, by virtue of Resolution 4947/2014, the introduction of the system of
tariff flags was approved starting in January 2015. The procedure provides for short-term
adjustments to be made to tariffs through the use of triggering indicators in the energy cost
component in final tariffs. Tariff flags are determined on a monthly basis and their purpose is to
mitigate the exposure of distributors' cash flows to high energy prices by reducing the difference
between the price paid for energy by distributors and the price paid by consumers to distributors
through tariff. A green flag signals low energy purchasing costs and does not change tariffs paid
by consumers. A yellow flag signals that power generation costs are rising due to use of thermal
energy in the generation mix and leads to a BRL 25 MWh increase in price. A red flag signals a
situation where the costs of providing electrical utilities are becoming even more expensive due
to the use of inefficient thermal power stations and results in a BRL 55 MWh increase in tariff.
The values of each tariff flag are revised annually or when necessary. On 28 August 2015,
since the most expensive thermal plants were shut down, therefore lowering generation costs,
ANEEL ruled that this flag would have its additional cost reduced from BRL 55 MWh to BRL 45
MWh.

In order to equalize impact of high energy costs for all DSOs in 2015, revenues due to tariff
flags have been shared among DSOs. Decree 8401/2015 created an account for centralising
resources from tariff flags and commanded that monthly ANEEL must calculate the required
amount to be transferred among DSOs, through this account. By Resolution 689/2015, ANEEL
approved a new regulation to deal with flags resources’ surplus. In the case when revenues are
higher than costs, surplus is kept by distributors and then returned to customers as lower tariffs
in next tariffary event.

Resolution 687/2015 introduced changes in Resolution 482/2012, which regulates micro and
mini distributed generation. It defines micro and mini DG as a renewable or combined cycle
power plant, limiting micro DG to 75 kW, and mini DG to 3 MW for hydraulic generation, and 5
MW for renewables. By this resolution, virtual energy compensation is now allowed between
different consumption points. The amount of compensation depends on the distance between
generation and consumption points. It also introduced the concept of “shared” energy contracts
that allow consumers to form groups. These groups are able to invest in a distributed generation
plant and define the way this energy will be shared among its members.

On 27 August 2015, the Public Hearing to set ABRACE’s associates’ tariffs (Brazilian Large
Industrial Energy Consumers and Free Consumers Association). CDE (“Conta de
Desenvolvimento Energético”) charge is calculated proportionally to the level of consumption for
all the consumers, which means that the largest consumers pay consequently more. ABRACE
disagrees with CDE’s calculation method and has won an injunction that allows the association
not to pay a part of the charge. The result of this Public Hearing will not have impacts in
ELEKTRO's results, but is a temporally cash flow mismatch. On September 24, ANEEL’s board
meeting discussed the results of the Public Hearing. ANEEL’s decision is to publish the new
tariff value of ABRACE’s associates according the injunction determines. The impacts will be
retroactive to the injunction date; 3 July 2015. ANEEL is trying to revert the judicial decision.
ABRADEE (Brazilian Electricity Distributors) has filled an injunction in order to protect DSOs
from any effects. There is still no judicial decision; therefore ABRACE’s injunction still in play.

250


--- Page 67 ---

In 2015, several concession contracts will be renewed. ANEEL discussed this topic in a Public
Hearing and formulated a new contract. The DSOs must accomplish the following criteria:

I. Efficiency in quality of service;

Il. Efficiency in economic and financial management;
Il. Operating and economic rationality;
IV. Reasonable and affordable prices.

Non-compliance with annual targets may result in capital contribution obligations for the
shareholders controlling the concession. The concessionaire’s failure to reach the annual
targets for two consecutive years during the first five-year period may result in the termination of
the concession. If the current concessionaire does not meet the new conditions, the concession
will be auctioned.

With regard to the sub-transmission assets transfer, in 2015, a Public Hearing was opened in
order to collect subsidies from agents to the proposal designed by ANEEL. It was expected that
the subject would be collecting subsidies until the end of the first half of 2016. However, the
proposal placed by ANEEL displeased many of the agents involved, and there is still strong
resistance to the transfer by the transmission agents. Thus, the regulatory agency has
suspended the proposal to improve it, which will come back to debate in 2016.

Regarding the structural projects, Energia Sustentavel do Brasil S.A. (ESBR), the consortium
responsible for the UHE Jirau plant, is immersed in legal battles with ANEEL and ABRADEE for
the delay of the project, caused, among other reasons, by workers' strikes and conflicts in
construction sites. In April 2015, ANEEL decided that the Company would be entitled to claim
only 52 days of “non-responsibility” for the delay, despite the request of the Company for 535
days. The Court decision of May 2015, however, ratified an injunction of ESBR, exempting
ESBR from a penalty and granting a postponement in the work schedule of 535 days.

Due to the amendment of Jirau’s contract, there is more than one schedule for the construction
of the hydroelectric plant, what makes any interpretation of legal decisions very complex.

In September 2015, ANEEL presented a request for suspension of the Court decision, and
ABRADEE presented an appeal pleading the invalidity of Jirau’s sentence for the fact that
DSOs were not represent in the Court proceedings, being the signatories of the PPAs and being
directly affected by the process, since the application of the exempt of responsibility can make
them exposed to the spot market. At the end of the month, ABRADEE obtained an injunction to
the Court decision to protect DSOs from the financial effects.

ABRADEE’s injunction was nullified in late November 2015, leaving distributors as debtors of
BRL 3.7 billion against ESBR. On 1 December 2015, another legal decision was issued.
However, CCEE (Camara de Comercializagao de Energia Elétrica) and ABRADEE have
divergent approaches, the first one considering that Jirau has a credit and the second one
considering that Jirau has a debt. ANEEL has already been required by ABRADEE to assist in
the interpretation of the decision.

5. MAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
5.1. Risk Management System

The IBERDROLA Group is exposed to various inherent risks in the countries, industries and
markets in which it operates and the businesses it carries out, which could prevent it from
achieving its objectives and executing its strategies successfully.

The Company's Board of Directors, aware of the importance of this matter, promotes the
necessary mechanisms so that the risks relevant to all of the Group's activities and businesses
are appropriately identified, measured, managed and controlled, and has established, through
the Group's general risk control and management policy, the basic mechanisms and principles
necessary for the appropriate management of risk-opportunity with a level of risk which allows:

- attain the strategic objectives formulated by the Group with controlled volatility;
- provide the maximum level of assurance to the shareholders;
- protect the results and reputation of the Group;

- defend the interests of shareholders, customers, other groups interested in the progress
of the Company, and of the society in general; and

- ensure corporate stability and financial strength in a sustained manner over time.

For the development of the aforementioned commitment, the Board of Directors and its
Executive Committee have the cooperation of the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee,
which, as a consultative body, monitors and reports upon the appropriateness of the
assessment system and internal control of significant risks, acting in coordination with the audit
committees existing in other companies of the Group.

Every action aimed at controlling and mitigating risks will consider the following basic action
principles:

a) Integrate the risk-opportunity vision into the Company’s management, through a definition
of the strategy and the risk appetite and the incorporation of this variable into strategic
and operating decisions.

b) Segregate functions, at the operating level, between risk-taking areas and areas
responsible for the analysis, control, and monitoring of such risks, ensuring an
appropriate level of independence.

c) Guarantee the proper use of risk-hedging instruments and the maintenance of records
thereof as required by applicable law.

d) Inform regulatory agencies and principal external players, in a transparent way, regarding
the Group risks and the operation of the systems developed to monitor such risks,
maintaining suitable channels that favour communication.

The Risk control and management general policy, as well as the Summary of the corporate risk
policies and the Summary of the specific risk policies for the various businesses of the Group
are available on the corporate website (www.iberdrola.com).

In order to align the risk impact with the established risk appetite, the Executive Committee of
the Board of Directors, acting at the proposal of the business or corporate divisions involved
and upon a prior report from the Group’s Risk Committee, annually reviews and approves
specific guidelines regarding the Group’s risk limits.

Pursuant to established guidelines, the competent administrative bodies of each company of the
Group, within such company’s area of responsibility, reviews and approves the specific risk
limits applicable to each of them.

The companies and corporate functions of the Group are responsible for implementing, within
their areas of activity, the control systems required for compliance with the Risk control and
management general policy and with the limits thereunder.

The risk factors to which the Group is generally subject are listed below:

a) Corporate Governance Risks: the Company assumes the need to safeguard the social
interest of the Company and the strategy of sustained maximisation of the economic
value of the Company and its long-term success, in accordance with social interest,
culture and the Group’s corporate vision, taking into account the legitimate public and
private interests that converge in the conduct of all business activities, particularly those
of the various stakeholders and communities and regions in which the Company and its
employees act. A fundamental requirement for the foregoing is compliance with the
Company’s Corporate governance system, comprising the By-Laws, the Corporate
policies, the internal corporate governance rules and the other internal codes and
procedures approved by the competent decision-making bodies of the Company and
inspired by the good governance recommendations generally recognised in
international markets.

b) Market risks: defined as the exposure of the Group’s results and assets to changes in
market prices and variables, such as exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices
(electricity, gas, CO, emission rights, other fuel, etc.), prices of financial assets and
others.

c) Credit risks: defined as the possibility that a counterparty fails to perform its contractual
obligations, thus causing an economic or financial loss to the Group. Counterparties can
be final customers, counterparties in financial or energy markets, partners, suppliers, or
contractors.

254


--- Page 71 ---

d) Business risks: defined as the uncertainty regarding the performance of key variables
inherent in the business, such as the characteristics of demand, weather conditions, the
strategies of different players, and others.

e) Regulatory risks: defined as those arising from regulatory changes made by the various
regulators, such as changes in compensation of regulated activities or in the required
conditions of supply, environmental regulation, tax regulation including risks relating to
political changes that might affect legal security and the legal framework applicable to
the businesses of the Group in each jurisdiction, the nationalisation or expropriation of
assets, the cancelation of operating licenses and the early termination of contracts with
Government.

f) Operational, technological, environmental, social and legal risks: defined as those
related to direct or indirect economic losses resulting from inadequate internal
procedures, technical failures, human error, or as a consequence of certain external
events, including the economic, social, environmental, and reputational impact thereof,
as well as legal and fraud risks. The said risks include those associated with information
technology and cybersecurity, as well as the risk of technological obsolescence, among
others.

g) Reputational risks: potential negative impact on the value of the Company resulting
from Company's behaviour below the expectations created among various
stakeholders: shareholders, customers, media, analysts, Government, employees, and
society in general.

Owing to its universal and dynamic nature, the system allows for the consideration of new risks
that may affect the Group as a consequence of changes in its operating environment or
revisions of objectives and strategies, as well as adjustments resulting from ongoing monitoring,
verification, review and supervision activities.

The Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of the Board of Directors periodically monitors the
evolution of the Company's risks:

- It reviews the Group’s risk quarterly reports, which include monitoring compliance
with risk limits and indicators and updated key risk maps, submitted by the Group’s
director of corporate risks.

- It coordinates and reviews risk reports sent periodically, at least semi-annually, by
the audit and compliance committees of the main subsidiaries of the Group, being
included the subholding companies of the main countries where the Group operates
that, along with the risk director appearances are used to prepare a risk report for
the Board of Directors at least semi-annually.

For further details, see the section Control! systems and risk management of the Corporate
Governance Report 2015.

5.2 Credit risk

The IBERDROLA Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its counterparties (customers,
suppliers, financial institutions, partners, etc.) default on their contractual obligations. The
exposure may arise with regard to unsettled amounts, the cost of substituting products not
supplied and also, in the case of dedicated plants, outstanding amounts.

The credit risk is managed and limited in accordance with the type of transaction and the
creditworthiness of the counterparties. A specific corporate credit risk policy is in place which
establishes criteria for admission, approval systems, authorisation levels, scoring tools,
exposure measurement methodologies, etc.

255


--- Page 72 ---

With regard to credit risk on trade receivables, the historical cost of defaults has remained
moderate and stable at close to 1% of total turnover of this activity, despite the current difficult
economic environment. Regarding other exposure (counterparties in transactions with financial
derivatives, placement of cash surpluses, transactions involving energy and guarantees
received from third parties), no significant defaults or losses were incurred in 2015 or 2014.

At 31 December 2015 and 2014, there is no significant credit risk concentration in the
IBERDROLA Group.

5.3 Financial risk
5.3.1 Interest rate risk

The IBERDROLA Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates affecting cash
flows and market value in respect of items in the balance sheet (debt and derivatives). In order
to adequately manage and limit this risk, the IBERDROLA Group manages annually the
proportion of fixed and variable debt and establishes the actions to be carried out throughout
the year: new sources of financing (at a fixed, floating or indexed rate) and/or the use of interest
rate derivatives.

Debt arranged at floating interest rates is basically tied to Euribor, Libor-GBP and Libor-USD
and to the most liquid local reference indexes in the case of the borrowings of the Latin
American subsidiaries.

The debt structure at 31 December 2015, once considered the hedge provided by the
derivatives traded, is included in the Note 5 of the Consolidated financial statements.

Given the composition of the IBERDROLA Group's debt at year end, between fixed and floating
interest rate (46% fixed / 54% floating), and assuming it remains the same in the future, the
impact on profit and loss of a potential rise of 25 basis points (0.25%) in the benchmark rates
mentioned in the previous paragraph would be EUR 40 million (higher finance cost).

5.3.2 Foreign currency risk

As the IBERDROLA Group's presentation currency is the euro, fluctuations in the value of the
currencies in which borrowings are instrumented and transactions are carried out with respect
to the euro, mainly the Sterling pound, the US dollar and the Brazilian real, may have an effect
on the finance costs, profit and equity of the Group.

The following items could be affected by foreign currency risk:
- Proceeds from energy supplies and payment for energy supplies and raw materials
purchased in currencies other than the euro.
- Settlement of financial operations to hedge the price of energy commodities.

- Debt denominated in currencies other than the local or functional currency of the
IBERDROLA Group companies.

- Collections and payments for supplies, services or equipment acquisition in currencies
other than the local or functional currency.

256


--- Page 73 ---

- Income and expenses of certain foreign subsidiaries indexed in currencies other than
the local or functional currency.

- Profit or loss on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries.
- Consolidated carrying amount of net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The IBERDROLA Group reduces this risk by

- Ensuring that all its economic flows are carried out in the currency of each Group
company, provided that this is possible and economically viable and efficient, through
the use of derivatives if not.

- As far as possible, this covers the risk of transfer of earnings scheduled for the current
year, thereby limiting the ultimate impact on Group earnings.

- Mitigating the impact on the consolidated net asset value of a hypothetical depreciation
of currencies due to Group’s investment in foreign subsidiaries by maintaining foreign
currency debt, as well as through financial derivatives.

The debt structure at 31 December 2015, once considered the hedge provided by the
derivatives traded, is included in the Note 5 of the Consolidated financial statements.

Considering the composition of the finance cost in foreign currency in 2015 (59% EUR, 21%
USD, 15% GBP, 5% BRL), a 5% rise in the main currencies and assuming it remains the same
in the future would have a negative impact on profit and loss of EUR 24 million (higher
consolidated finance cost in euros).

5.3.3 Liquidity risk

Exposure to adverse situations in the debt or capital markets or in relation to the IBERDROLA
Group's own economic/financial situation may hinder or prevent the IBERDROLA Group from
obtaining the financing required to properly carry on its business activities.

The IBERDROLA Group’s liquidity policy is aimed at ensuring that it can meet its payment
obligations without having to obtain financing under unfavourable terms. For this purpose,
various management measures are used such as the arrangement of committed credit facilities
of sufficient amount, deadline and flexibility, diversification of the coverage of financing needs
through access to different markets and geographical areas, and diversification of the maturities
of the debt issued.

The sum of cash, liquid assets and committed undrawn credit facilities would sufficiently cover
the Group's expected liquidity requirements for a period of over 24 months, excluding the
arrangement of any new credit.

The figures relating to changes in the Company's debt are included in Notes 25 and 50 to the
Consolidated financial statements.

257


--- Page 74 ---

5.4 Country risk

The activities of the different businesses that the IBERDROLA Group developed are submitted,
in greater or lesser extent depending on their characteristics, to various risks inherent to the
country where they operate:

— Imposition of monetary and other restrictions on the movement of capital
— Changes in the market

— Economic crises, political instability and social unrest affecting operations
— Nationalisation or expropriation of assets.

— Exchange rate fluctuations

— The cancelation of operating licenses

— The termination of Government contracts

— Changes to administrative policies and regulations in the country

The results of our international subsidiaries, their market value and their contribution to the
Group may be affected by such risks.

The IBERDROLA Group's main operations are focused on Spain, United Kingdom, USA, Brazil
and Mexico, countries with low or moderate risk, whose credit ratings are as follows:

Country Moody’s S&P Fitch

Spain Baa2 BBB BBB+
United Kingdom Aa1 AAA AAt

United States Aaa AA+ AAA

Brazil Baa3 BB+ BB+
Mexico A3 BBB+ BBB+
The presence in countries other than the ones mentioned above is not significant at Group level

from an economic point of view.
5.5 Activity risks

The activities of the various businesses developed by the IBERDROLA Group are subject to
various risks including market, credit, operational, business, regulatory and reputational risks
arising from the uncertainty of the main variables that affect them.

5.5.1 Regulatory and politic risks

Companies in the IBERDROLA Group are subject to laws and regulations concerning prices
and other aspects of their activities in each of the countries in which they operate. The
introduction of new laws and regulations or amendments to the already existing ones may have
an adverse effect on the Group’s operations annual results and economic value of businesses.

The following paragraphs are a few of the new major regulatory measures that were approved
in 2015 or are due to be implemented in 2016:

- Spain:

Approval of Ministerial Order IET/2660/2015 of 11 December 2015 approving unit
remuneration for electricity distributors, establishing the first regulation period up to 31
December 2019.

258


--- Page 75 ---

- United Kingdom:

The approval of the new remuneration framework for electricity distributors in the UK,
RIIO-ED1, which will regulate income over an eight-year period between April 2015 and
March 2023.

There is uncertainty concerning potential measures approved as a result of the analysis
of the electricity retail market performed by the CMA, the UK's competition authority,
and the measures approved to finalise regulation of the obligation to fit smart electricity
and gas meters.

- United States:

Approval of the new PTC tax incentive scheme for renewable energies, valid up to the
year 2020.

There is uncertainty concerning the forthcoming review of tariffs for the gas and
electricity distribution companies NYSEG and RG&E.

- Brazil:

Approval of Elektro's four-year tariff review, which came into force on 27 August 2015,
by Brazilian regulator ANEEL, valid up to August 2019.

- Mexico:

Uncertainties about the Energy Market Reform currently being drawn up which,
according to the best information available, could affect the profitability of assets
dedicated to selling electricity to private partners and the outlook for plants currently
under construction.

5.5.2 Network business risk

The regulations of each country in which the IBERDROLA Group's network businesses operate
establish regularly revised frameworks, guaranteeing that these businesses will receive
reasonable and predictable returns. These frameworks include penalties and bonuses for
efficiency, service quality and, eventually, for default management, which have a minor,
immaterial impact overall. Significant structural anendments to these regulations could pose a
risk to these businesses.

In general, the profitability of the IBERDROLA Group's network businesses is not exposed to
demand risk, except for the Brazilian subsidiaries.

The IBERDROLA Group's network businesses in Spain and the United Kingdom do not sell
energy and, therefore, they are not exposed to any market risk associated with energy prices.

The network businesses in Brazil and some USA sell energy to regulated customers at a price
determined by certain previously approved tariffs. In the event a prudent management policy is
followed regarding supply and in accordance with that established by the regulator, the
regulatory frameworks in both countries guarantee sums will be collected in subsequent tariff
readjustment reviews for possible purchase price deviations from those previously recognised in
the tariff.

Given the above, in the case of extraordinary events (extreme drought in Brazil as happened in
2014, catastrophic storms in USA, etc.), occasional temporary gaps between payments and
collections may arise with an impact on the cash flows of some of these businesses and
ultimately on profits recognised under IFRS.

259


--- Page 76 ---

5.5.3 Renewable business

The regulations of each country in which the Group operates establish regulatory frameworks
aimed at promoting the development of renewable energies based on formulas which may
include premiums, green certificates, tax or regulated tariff deductions, which allow investors to
obtain sufficient and reasonable return. Any change to the aforementioned regulation may
represent a risk for said business.

In addition to the aforementioned regulatory risk, Group’s renewable energy businesses may be
subject, to a greater or lesser extent, to wind resource risk and market risk.

The Group considers that the wind resource risk is mitigated through the high number of wind
power farms available and their geographic diversification, and the trend to compensate less
wind energy periods with those with high wind energy on the medium term.

Regarding the electricity price risk the following should be mentioned:

e Renewables business — Spain

Subsequent to the approval of the new regulatory framework (Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, of 12
July, Law 24/2013, of 26 December, Royal Decree 413/2014, of 6 June, and Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014, of 16 June), all renewable energy generated is remunerated at market price
plus a premium per MW. This guarantees a reasonable regulated return based on a recognised
standard investment. This return is readjusted every three years within predetermined bands to
cover any possible deviation in market price. This premium per MW is not applicable for wind
farms brought on line during and before 2004. As a result, initially all output would be fully or
partially exposed to market risk.

e Renewables business — United Kingdom

The renewables business in the UK is partially exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the market
price of electricity in the UK, since the obtained revenue comprise income from the energy sold
and income from the sale of renewable energy certificates.

« Renewables business — United States and other countries
The renewables businesses in the other countries in which the Group operates sell their energy,
preferably at a fixed price, whether through regulated tariffs or through long-term power

purchase agreements (PPAs).

However, in the USA, 33% of the energy produced is sold to the market in more or less short
terms.

With electricity prices around USD 30 per MWh, a 5% change in prices could give rise to an
impact of EUR +8 million in operating results.

The positions exposed to market risk of the renewables businesses in Spain and the UK are

managed and included in their position in the Deregulated businesses in these countries, to be
hedged in the most efficient manner possible.

260


--- Page 77 ---

5.5.4 Deregulated electricity and gas generation and retailing businesses Commodity
price risk

The activities of the Group's deregulated businesses are subject to a range of market, credit,
operating, business and regulatory risks, coming from the uncertainty of the main variables that
affect them, such as: fluctuations in commodity prices, changes in hydroelectric and wind
energy production (of both the Group's and of third parties), changes in electricity and gas
demand, and plant availability.

The main variable that affects IBERDROLA’s result in terms of raw materials’ market price, is
the electricity price. However, in many countries, electricity prices are strongly correlated with
the price of the fuels used in its production. Therefore, risk studies are carried out on fuel price
trends.

In the case of fuel and CO, emission allowances, these risks are evident in:

e The electricity generation and retailing business, in which the IBERDROLA Group is
exposed to variations in the price of CO2 emission rights and in the sale price of
electricity, as well as to variations in fuel costs (mainly gas and coal).

e The gas retailing business, in which a large portion of the IBERDROLA Group's
operating expenses relate to the purchase of gas for customer supplies. The
IBERDROLA Group is therefore exposed to the risk of variations in the price of gas.

e Unhedged energy transactions (discretionary trading).
To a large extent, the mutual closing out of positions by the generation business and retailing
business mitigates the market risk to which the Group is exposed. The remaining risk is
mitigated by diversifying sale and purchase agreements, and specific clauses therein, as well as

by arranging derivatives.

e Deregulated business in Spain

Commodities’ Price risk

Given current market conditions, the production price of the coal-fired power plants defines, to a
large extent, the price of electricity in Spain since coal is the marginal technology necessary to
cover electricity demand. Consequently, the price of coal conditions revenues from the other
less expensive technologies which are used to cover demand. With coal prices around USD 45
per t, a 5% change in the prices could give rise to an impact of EUR -20/+20 million on
operating results.

The price of CO, influences the cost of production in coal-fired power plants. With coal prices

around EUR 8.5 per t, a 5% change in the prices could give rise to an impact of EUR -10/+10
million on operating results.

261


--- Page 78 ---

The majority of gas supplied in Spain is paid indexed to the price of oil by means of complex
formulas. IBERDROLA has these types of agreements for the supply of gas, as well as other
types of fixed-price supply and with prices not indexed to the market price of oil. These
agreements are used for electricity generation, for the consumption of its final customers and for
sale to other intermediaries. Due to the fact that the electricity generation margin is covered by
the contracting formulas of the system operator, only residual risk remains in sales to final
customers and third parties. The risk assumed is reduced and depends on the correlation
between the price of oil and the European and international gas prices. In the event of a 5%
fluctuation in the oil price, the risk would be EUR -3/+2 million.

Hydraulic risk

Despite having a large water storage capacity, IBERDROLA's results depend significantly on
the flow contributions. The changes in output with respect to the average value can be up to -
4,000 GWh in a dry year and +5,000 GWh in a wet year, the variability would be between EUR -
150/+100 million. The loss of profit is not covered as it is an IBERDROLA’s inherent risk.

Demand risk

Given the current market condition, where price is primarily determined by the generation cost
of coal-fired plants, which make up around 15% of the generation mix, it is not considered that
demand fluctuations will impact on marginal technology in the market. The impact on the market
price of a 1% change in demand is therefore limited, amounting to approximately EUR 0.25 per
MWh.

A moderate drop in demand in Spain does not affect the scheduled output of the Group's
nuclear, hydroelectric and wind power plants, since there is a mandatory electricity market in
Spain guaranteeing the efficient dispatch of output from all technologies.

Nevertheless, there could be an impact if a drop in electricity demand entails an equivalent
reduction in the Group's retail sales and consequent narrowing of margin. This is mitigated to
some extent by increasing sales of own energy on the wholesale market.

Taking both effects into account, it is estimated that a 1% fluctuation in demand would have an
impact of EUR +15 million overall.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from nuclear power
plant outages (due to stoppages for fuel reloading, in accordance with a pre-established
schedule) and hydroelectric power plant outages which are not associated with a large storage
reservoir (flow facilities, in which water is not storable). As a result of such outages, production
and, therefore, the margin associated with this production are lost. This risk is managed through
excellence in the operating and maintenance practices of the plants and a culture focused on
total quality and the reduction of operational risks, which allow the impact of this risk to be kept
low.

¢ Deregulated business — United Kingdom
Commodity price risk

The IBERDROLA Group will not count on having coal plants in the UK after the closure of
current plant Longannet planned for the end of March 2016.

262


--- Page 79 ---

In the British market, geared towards thermal power generation, the clean spark spread has
become the appropriate index to follow the uncertainty of the margins of coal-fired power plants.
Despite the fact that commodities (coal, CO2 and electricity) are listed separately, the
uncertainty of the unit margin is studied since it has been detected that it is a better indicator of
the uncertainty of the results. With clean spark spread levels around GBP 3 per MWh, a 5%
change in the spreads could give rise to an impact of EUR +1 million on operating results.

In addition to its use as fuel in combined cycle power plants, IBERDROLA sells gas to
customers in the United Kingdom and has long-term gas agreements to do so. A portion of the
aforementioned agreements has their price linked to the British wholesale markets and,
therefore, they do not represent any risk for the Company. However, there are agreements for
which the price is fixed and which are linked to other indexes. These represent a risk if the price
of gas changes. At the current levels, a 5% change to the price would have an impact of EUR
+8 million on results.

Demand risk

Electricity consumption demand is usually one of the most significant risk factors for any
company. However, IBERDROLA currently purchases from third parties a significant portion of
the energy it sells (1,800, 2,500 and 4,100 GWh in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of a total
amount of electricity sold of 22,000 GWh/year), since it is more profitable to do so under current
market conditions than IBERDROLA producing it and using its own thermal power plants. From
a business perspective, fluctuations in electricity demand mean that additional amounts of
electricity need to be purchased or that these acquisitions need to be reduced. In any case, the
profit or loss IBERDROLA obtains from this intermediation is low and much lower than that
obtained from its own output. Thus, demand fluctuations have a small impact on profit or loss of
EUR +10 million for every 1% fluctuation in customer demand.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from outages at the
Longannet coal-fire plant and the combined cycle power plants. With regard to these outages,
all profit or loss obtained from production is committed, although the high operating and
maintenance standards of the plants and a culture focused on total quality and the reduction of
operational risks, allow the impact on this risk to be kept low. Loss of profit from this type of
events (material damages or machinery malfunctions) is covered by an insurance policy after a
certain deductible level, which is marked by the risk retention level that IBERDROLA can
assume and the insurance conditions that the market offers for risks of these types.

¢ Deregulated business — Mexico
Commodity price risk

Electricity generation at Iberdrola Generacién Mexico is gas-intensive. Gas prices therefore
comprise an essential component of this risk.

Approximately 85% of the electricity generated in Mexico is sold through long-term sales
agreements (to CFE and, to a lesser extent, other major industrial customers), whereby the risk
associated with the price of gas for generating this electricity is passed on.

The remaining energy is sold to customers at a price linked to the official tariffs published by

CFE. These tariffs depend on the price of the various fuels, specially fuel-oil, diesel, natural gas
and coal.

263


--- Page 80 ---

As a result, there is a risk associated with the price of these fuels on the international markets:

« A5% change in fuel-oil or diesel prices (which are closely linked) would give rise to a
EUR +3 million change in results.

« A 5% change in the natural gas price would give rise to a EUR +1 million change in
results.

« A5% change in the price of coal would give rise to a EUR +1 million change in results.

Demand risk

The structure of the agreements IBERDROLA has entered into in Mexico isolates the business
results from electricity demand fluctuations. Revenues come mainly from plant availability and
only the sales indexed at the official Mexican tariff are subject to a certain extent by the
fluctuation in demand. Nonetheless, most of the plants have committed sales exceeding their
production capacity and therefore a shift in demand would not have an impact on their
operations or results as the electricity generated would be sold to another customer. Changes in
electricity demand in Mexico therefore have no effect on results.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from combined cycle
power plant outages. With regard to these outages, all profit or loss obtained from production is
compromised, although the high operating and maintenance standards of the plants and a
culture focused on total quality and the reduction of operational risks, allow the impact of this
tisk to be kept low. Loss of profit from this type of event (material damages or machinery
malfunctions) is covered by an insurance policy after a certain deductible level, which is marked
by the risk retention level that IBERDROLA can assume, and the insurance conditions that the
market offers for risks of these types.

e Deregulated business — United States and Canada

Commodity price risk

IBERDROLA’s business in the United States and Canada is geared towards natural gas
transport and storage. As a result, the risk assumed mainly arises from fluctuations in the price
of natural gas over time. There is no risk arising from the price levels but rather from the
difference in the price of natural gas between the period of high prices (winter) and the period of
low prices (summer). In the event the difference between both periods is USD 0.35 per MWh, if
the aforementioned difference were to fluctuate by 5%, the uncertainty of the results would be
EUR +3 million.

Operational risk
The business's gas storage facilities are exposed to operational risks associated with outages
impeding the injection or extraction of gas, gas storage leaks and shifts in geological structures
that hinder recovering injected gas.
IBERDROLA mitigates such risk by conforming to the highest standards of predictive and

corrective maintenance, and permanently monitoring the geological parameters of the storage
facilities. This will enable it to respond quickly to any potential threats that may be identified.

264


--- Page 81 ---

¢ Gas supply operations

The IBERDROLA Group maintains an adequate balance in the global mix, both in terms of the
number of supplier countries and the type of supply (gas via pipelines or GNL), which is
demonstrated in that it has five suppliers from different areas (Norway, Nigeria, Algeria and
Qatar, among others).

In the Spanish case, gas supply is guaranteed through long-term agreements. The 13% of this
mix of agreements is at a fixed price and the remainder is linked to the prices of various fuels on
international markets.

Approximately the 25% of long-term gas agreements in the United Kingdom are at a fixed price,
while the others are indexed to electricity, gas and other petroleum products on international
markets, and to inflation in the UK.

Gas supply in Mexico is secured through long-term agreements with PEMEX and CFE at a price
linked to international natural gas prices in the US.

The gas business in the United States and Canada involves natural gas storage, whereby net
gas purchases are not necessary over and above the fuel needed for the transfer, injection and
extraction thereof. These quantities are small and procured gradually on local gas markets
without the existence of long-term supply agreements.

Discretionary trading of electricity, gas, emissions allowances and other fuels and associated
products performed by some of the Group's businesses is residual and the overall risk thereof is
mitigated using individual stop-loss limits, whose total aggregate can never exceed 2% of the
consolidated net profit for the period, pursuant to the market risk policy approved by Iberdrola,
S.A.'s Board of Directors.

IBERDROLA has reduced discretionary trading in recent years in line with the widespread move
away from market speculation. At 31 December 2015, the notional value of derivatives used in
speculative trading (calculated in accordance with the criteria set forth in the European Market
Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)) was below EUR 150 million versus EUR 200 million at 31
December 2014.

5.5.5 Other operational risks

During 2015, all of the IBERDROLA Group’s activities, direct or indirect losses may arise as a
result of inadequate internal procedures, technical failures, human error or external factors.

Any of these risks could cause damage or destruction to the IBERDROLA Group's facilities, as
well as injuries to third parties or damage to the environment, along with the ensuing lawsuits,
especially in the event of power outages caused by accidents at our distribution networks and
possible penalties imposed by the authorities.

Although many of these risks are unpredictable, the IBERDROLA Group mitigates them by
carrying out the necessary investments, implementing operation and maintenance procedures
and programmes (supported by quality control systems), planning appropriate employee
training, and taking out the required insurance covering both material damages and civil liability.

265


--- Page 82 ---

In relation to the insurance cover, IBERDROLA has international insurance programmes to
cover equity (insurance for material damages, machinery breakdowns, loss of profits, damages
from natural disasters and risks arising from construction work) and third-party liabilities (general
civil liability, liability for environmental risks, professional civil liability, etc.).

However, this insurance does not completely eliminate operational risk, since it is not always
possible, or it is not in its interest to pass such risk on to insurance companies and, in addition,
cover is always subject to certain limitations.

Specifically, the IBERDROLA Group is also exposed to the following operational risks:

- Risk of malfunctions, explosions, fire, toxic spillages or polluted emissions in gas and
electricity distribution networks and generating plants. Risks in connection with
cybersecurity. Threats or vulnerabilities concerning data, control systems or Group
information and communications systems, and any consequences arising from access
to, use, disclosure, deterioration, interruption, unauthorised modification or destruction
of information or information systems.

- Risks concerning extreme meteorological conditions and other instances of force
majeure.

- Risk of sabotage and/or terrorism.

¢ Risks in connection with nuclear business

The IBERDROLA Group’s nuclear power plants in Spain are also exposed to risks relating to
their operations and risks arising from the storage and handling of radioactive materials.

- Constitutional Spanish law caps the liability of nuclear power plant operators in the
event of a nuclear accident at EUR 700 million. This liability for a nuclear accident must
be compulsorily insured by the operator of Spanish nuclear power plants. The
IBERDROLA Group meets this obligation by taking out Nuclear Civil Liability insurance
policies for each plant. However, Law 12/2011, of 27 May, concerning civil liability for
nuclear damage or damage caused by radioactive materials, will increase the operator's
liability ceiling and the consequent ceiling on mandatory insurance to EUR 1,200 million
for nuclear power plants. The law will enter into force when all signatories of the Paris
and Brussels Agreements ratify the 2004 Amendment Protocols, as established in these
agreements.

- Accordingly, it is important to point out the indirect economic risk to which the
aforementioned power plants are exposed as a result of a possible serious incident in
Spain or in other country could affect the periodic renewals of their compulsory
operating licences and the increase in their safety investments.

¢ Operational risk of operations in markets

Market trading conducted by the Group's various energy trading desks and treasury dealers is
also exposed to operational risk due to possible inappropriate processes, technological faults,
human error, fraud or any other external or internal event.

266


--- Page 83 ---

This risk in mitigated by following the operational risk policy when trading on the market based
on a robust risk control culture, a proper segregation of duties, the publication of clear
processes and policies and secure and flexible information systems. This policy sets specific
thresholds and guidelines applicable to all trades performed in accordance with the principle of
proportionality.

¢ Environmental risks

IBERDROLA accepts that the environment places constraints on all human activities and is a
factor of companies’ competitiveness, and it is committed to promoting innovation in this field
and also ecoefficiency, to gradually reducing the environmental impact of its activities, facilities,
products and services, and striving to ensure that its activities’ development is congruent with
future generations’ legitimate right to an appropriate environment.

The Group undertakes and promotes this commitment through its policies. IBERDROLA
currently has three specific policies in order to manage environmental issues: environmental
policy, anti-climate change policy and biodiversity policy, which set forth the principles through
which the Company will continue to improve its environmental management.

IBERDROLA was also included, for the twelfth consecutive year, on the global Dow Jones
Sustainability Index, a worldwide benchmark for recognition of companies’ contributions to
sustainable development, as well as on other prestigious international sustainability indexes. It
is the only utility company to have earned this distinction since the index since was created in
1999.

5.5.6 Legal risks

The IBERDROLA Group companies are part of a certain in-court and out-of-court disputes
within the ordinary course of their activities, the final result of which, in general, is uncertain. An
adverse result, or an out-of-court resolution thereof or other proceedings in the future could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial situation, operating results and cash
flows. However, the Group's legal advisers believe that the outcome of the aforementioned
disputes will not have a significant effect.

Note 43 of the Consolidated financial statements contains a more detailed description of the
most significant matters regarding “Contingent assets and liabilities’.

IBERDROLA Ventures - PERSEO is IBERDROLA's corporate venture capital programme for
investing in innovative technologies and business models that guarantee a sustainable energy
model. In 2015 the company and CDTI took up a stake in the Basque company Atten2, a spin-
off from IK4-Tekniker designing, manufacturing and selling sensors to monitor the status of
fluids in industrial applications. On its social investment programme, the company has invested
in SunFunder, which funds off-grid solar energy projects in emerging countries in Africa, Latin
America and Asia.

As part of a clear strategy, set out in the 2015-2017 Innovation Plan, innovation is
IBERDROLA’'s primary tool to guarantee the Company's sustainability, efficiency and
competitiveness, focusing on three main issues:

- Efficiency, geared towards a continuous streamlining of our operations, managing the
useful lives of facilities and equipment, cutting operation and maintenance costs, and
reducing our environmental footprint with the aim of adapting to an environment which
is more and more demanding and strives to improve constantly from the technological,
processes and operations point of view. More than 200 R&D&lI, all of which are
expected to have an effect on business in the short/medium term, are now ongoing
thanks to the involvement of all the IBERDROLA Group employees.

- New products and services, in response to customers’ needs in an increasingly global
and competitive market. These projects deploy existing technology to produce business
models offering power supply, facilities and technologies that are increasingly more
efficient and environment-friendly such as energy efficiency, electric vehicles, smart
grids and distributed energy resources.

- Disruptive business models and technologies that assist us in undertaking the energy
challenges ahead. And adapting to the changes that are arising from the electric sector.
Through PERSEO, IBERDROLA's corporate venture capital programme, we invest in
new disruptive technologies and areas of business focusing on making the energy
model sustainable.

Thanks to our human and economic resources allocated to innovation — EUR 3,747 thousand at
IBERDROLA and EUR 196,450 thousand at Group level — we are now at the forefront of
development of new products, services and business models that are transforming the energy
sector.

Some of the most innovative ventures by major area are as follows.

268


--- Page 85 ---

7.1. Renewable energies
In 2015, Innovation activities in Renewables have focused primarily on:

- Improving the efficiency of our operating assets,
- Improving the integration of renewable energies,

- Developing new designs or processes for construction in progress or for future or
ongoing projects associated with offshore wind power.

Efficiency improvement in Wind Farms is aimed at reducing operating and maintenance costs
and improving production.

The field of energy resources continues with the development of an internal model for the
design of wind farms based on fluid dynamics and the use of supercomputers. The works are
focused on the parameterization of the orographic conditions and the implementation of a model
with forest, which allow a further progress regarding current business models.

The best use of the oils used in the gearbox of wind turbines is being analysed in order to
extend its useful life and optimize the maintenance operations.

Among the available tools to manage the exploitation of the wind farms, it is working on the
continuous optimization of the production prediction to reduce the deviations from the actual
production (Meteoflow). Also it is enhancing the monitoring of the main equipment of the
turbines and their yields by an alerts interface and Indicators in order to diagnose anomalies
and / or prevent future failures (Diagnosis Matrix). Finally, some tools have been implemented
to optimize the scheduling maintenance work and the use of mobile devices for the completion
of work orders.

Among the projects to promote the integration of renewable energy highlights Smartwind
project, which aim is the implementation of models and simulations for storage use associated
to a wind farm in order to provide auxiliary services such as reducing production deviations
offered. Newplavol project focuses on photovoltaic storage.

Innovation in offshore wind projects is essential to reduce costs and to limit risks in ongoing and
future projects. In Wikinger wind farm it has been realized a validation campaign of the design
of the jacket foundation pile (responsible for setting the foundations to the ground) because of
the special characteristics of the bottom of the sea with significant improvements achieved. Also
it is important to mention the innovative design of the offshore substation for that park on their
consistent in its execution in two pieces with limitations of weight and size to be transported. In
the MARINEL project alternatives have been analysed for these types of difficulties, such as
self-installable substations. Another project of special interest is the replacement of offshore
meteorological towers which require costly foundations for their installation by floating stations
with an alternative measuring system known as LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging).
Leanwind project's main objective is to reduce costs over the park’s life and the supply chain by
the principles of "lean" application and the development of innovative solutions and tools. The
Best Paths project analyses the HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) multiterminal networks and
from different suppliers to see interactions with electric equipment of wind turbines in a scenario
in which the offshore wind will be connected to the network.

269


--- Page 86 ---

Finally, initiatives specifically orientated to sustainability such as BRIO project, should be
highlighted, which aims to analyse the wind farm after its useful life and the valuation of the high
value-added components of the wind turbine blades.

7.2 Clean generation technologies

During 2015, efforts in the area of generation focused on operating efficiency and flexibility,
environmental protection, and improved plant safety.

Operating efficiency and flexibility, and improved plant safety: the FILTRACIONES project has
been launched to develop a new methodology for efficiently inspecting waterways. In the field of
installation safety, the INSROCA, SIRO and ECRIGEN projects drew to a close with the
development of experimental prototypes and new methodologies in order to contribute to the
structural integrity of generation assets and lengthen their life cycle.

MIGRES and RESONUC were the stand-out nuclear projects. The first involves identifying and
developing a new end-to-end process for managing control bars and channels in order to
ensure they are more sustainably managed. The RESONUC project focuses on identifying and
developing a technological solution for mitigating resonance in critical systems at nuclear
facilities, thereby ensuring they perform as well as possible as a significant contributor to
nuclear plant safety and reliability.

Environmental: Iberdrola remains firmly committed to reducing the environmental impact of its
generating plants, backing an ambitious project entitled CO2ZFORMARE to find a solution to the
problem of macrofouling in the cooling systems of electricity generating plants in a sustainable
manner and mitigating the environmental impact both emissions into the atmosphere and the
aquatic environment. During 2015, the technical know-how obtained in the COEBEN-I! project,
conducted at the Velilla del Rio Carrién thermal power plant are being incorporated to the plant
in Lada and Longannet in order to adequate them to the environmental requirements which are
more and more restrictive, offering an alternative to high cost commercial solutions.

7.3 Commercial Area - New projects and services

Innovation is essential in commercial activity, in order to offer customers the products and
services best adapted to their needs. Thus in 2015 IBERDROLA has launched:

- New products such as "Planes a tu Medida" (Plans to suit you): a new category of
products that lets customers choose the plan best suited to their lifestyles, with no need
to make any changes to their consumption habits. To date 7 plans have been created
with a range of alternatives: Contigo Elige 8 horas, Contigo Noche, Contigo Fin de
Semana, Plan Estable, Contigo Verano, Contigo Invierno and Plan 8.760 horas.

- New services such as:

o Smart Solar Iberdrola: comprehensive package that will include the design,
assembly and connection of a fully customised solar installation, as well as a
finance plan, advice, all-inclusive maintenance, and the possibility to manage
and supervise their facilities using web tools and innovative applications. The
Company will also be offering all the back-up energy that may be needed.
Customers will then be able to generate and consume their own electricity,
thereby optimising consumption and improving the energy efficiency of their
facilities.

270

o “Hogar Inteligente Iberdrola" or |berdrola's Smart Home: a product focusing on
efficient heating management, consisting of a smart thermostat with an Internet
connection, easily programmed and controlled by a mobile phone, enabling our
household customers to save up to 37% on their annual heating bills.

o Moreover, IBERDROLA continues working on its initiative in electric mobility,
consistent with its strategy in support of sustainable development and its
commitment with innovation, developing new recharging services and
participating in programmes of R&D&l, financed with community and regional
funds, such as Remourban and Azkarga. Also notable is its participation in the
European GRID4EU innovation project on smart networks, providing the
customers with real-time information on their electricity consumption, together
with flexible rates by time periods so that they can manage their consumption
more efficiently.

7.4 Smart grids

During 2015, Iberdrola Distribution has continued to increase its efforts in R&D projects, related
to smart grids in the Spanish and European field. The Group’s R&D activity in the Networks
area focuses on optimizing the distribution grid, with an emphasis on worker safety,
environmental issues, and the improvement in the quality of supply. In Europe, Iberdrola heads
up the UPGRID project through which it intends to strengthen its capability as an integrator of
active demand and low-voltage distributed generation. The IGREENGrid and DISCERN projects
continue. The former aims to develop precise methodologies for integrating renewable assets
into the electricity distribution grid, while the latter is benchmarking the different smart grid
solutions and looking for the best combination of architectures and that will put end in 2016. The
projects ADVANCED and GRID+ have concluded and the European Commission decided to
continue this activity through the new project GRID++ (with EASE), participating through
EDSO4SG. In Spain, IBERDROLA finished in 2015 PRICE project aims to cover the needs
identified for the development of an intelligent network within a framework of efficiency, safety
and sustainability. In the area of overhead line maintenance and normalisation, IBERDROLA
leads MATUSALEN to develop a tool for determining the ageing of medium-voltage cables in
underground lines and SILECTRIC projects to develop new insulators for high-voltage overhead
lines and equipment which will be finished in 2017. TABON project finished at the end of 2015
to develop a line inspection and verification solution.

Along the same lines, projects are underway in UK to drive the development of smart grids.
Three mayor projects are currently being developed: ARC project, which aims to speed up the
process of connecting renewable assets to the distribution grid; FLEXNET project, in order to
develop solutions and technologies which improve and increase network capacity by 20% and
VISOR project that implements a monitoring system of transmission network to know the
capability and the dynamic performance during the planning and operation. It is important to
mention ROAMES project, which objective is to look for optimize the use of LIDAR technology
for network management and surrounding vegetation, which allows savings of 20-60% on the
cost of deforestation. In Brazil, there are ongoing innovative projects for the inspection of
distribution networks like VANTS and ROBO; projects for the installation of underground
networks in the cities, in order to reduce the impact of air lines and projects to improve
protection among others. It is important to mention, ELEKTROBUS project, which aim is to
develop a prototype vehicle with an electric propulsion system through ultra-capacitors.

In USA, the INTEGRATED AERIAL DAMAGE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM Project, which objective

is to develop an aerial system for evaluating damage to the electricity grid caused by severe
storms.

independently to achieve its goals and is fully functional and autonomous. Without prejudice to

through the Instituto Iberdrola Brasil, receiving EUR 296 thousand.
