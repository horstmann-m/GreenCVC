PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.1 PROFILE, ORGANIZATION AND STRATEGY OF THE GROUP

1.1 PROFILE, ORGANIZATION AND STRATEGY OF THE GROUP

1.1.1 General presentation

GDF SUEZ is one of the world’s leading industrial companies and a
benchmark in the fields of gas, electricity and energy services.

It is active throughout the entire energy value chain, in electricity and
natural gas, upstream to downstream in:

= purchasing, production and marketing of natural gas and
electricity;

m transmission, storage, _ distribution,
development of major gas infrastructures;

management = and

= energy services.
GDF SUEZ operates a well-balanced business model:

m through its presence in complementary business activities across
the value chain;

m through its presence in regions exposed to different business and
economic cycles, with a strong presence in emerging markets

with greater prospects for growth, a position that was further
strengthened in 2011 and 2012 with the integration of
International Power. While the Group still intends to maintain its
position as a key player in Europe and a leader of the energy
transition, it is now a benchmark energy provider in the emerging
world;

m through its presence allocated between activities that are
exposed to market uncertainties and others that offer recurring
revenues (infrastructures, services, PPA-type contracts", etc.);

m through a balanced energy mix with priority given to low- and
Zero-carbon energy sources.

Listed in Paris and Brussels, GDF SUEZ is represented in the major

stock indices (see Section 5.1.1.1 “Share capital and voting rights”).

The Group’s fundamental values are drive, commitment, daring and
cohesion.

1.1.2 History and evolution of the Company

GDF SUEZ is the result of the merger-absorption of SUEZ by Gaz
de France, following the decision of the Combined General
Shareholders’ Meetings of Gaz de France and SUEZ of July 16,
2008. The merger took effect on July 22, 2008.

Initially incorporated in 1946 as an EPIC (French public industrial
and commercial enterprise), it became a limited liability company
with a 99-year term under Law 2004-803 of August 9, 2004 on the
electricity and gas public service and electricity and gas companies.
(amending Law 46-628 of April 8, 1946) whose provisions were
aimed at organizing the change in the Company's legal status.
Unless the Company is dissolved earlier or its term is extended, it
will cease trading on November 19, 2103.

On July 7, 2005, the Company publicly floated its shares on the
stock market. The Company's shares, under its former name, Gaz
de France, were first listed on July 7, 2005.

Law 2004-803 of August 9, 2004, as amended by Law 2006-1537
of December 7, 2006 governing the energy sector and Decree
2007-1784 of December 19, 2007 authorized the transfer of the
Company from the public to the private sector. On July 22, 2008,
the Company absorbed SUEZ in a merger which entailed
transferring the majority of the company’s share capital to the
private sector. The new company took the name “GDF SUEZ”.

SUEZ itself was the result of the merger in 1997 of Compagnie de
Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux. At the time, Compagnie de Suez -
which had built and operated the Suez Canal until its nationalization
by the Egyptian government in 1956 - was a holding company with
diversified stakes in Belgium and France, particularly in the finance
and energy sectors. Lyonnaise des Eaux was a diversified company
in the management and treatment of water, waste, construction,
communications and technical facility management. SUEZ became

an international industrial and services group whose objective was
to meet essential requirements in electricity, gas, energy and
industry services, water and waste management.

The deregulation of European energy markets in the early 1990s
promoted the international development of both Gaz de France and
SUEZ, which progressively expanded their activities beyond their
respective traditional markets, both in Europe and internationally.

The approval of the merger by the European Commission given on
November 14, 2006 was conditional on the implementation of
remedial action in certain areas. The principal remedies required for
EC approval were duly carried out.

On February 3, 2011, the Company completed a merger with
International Power. In 2012, GDF SUEZ confirmed its strategy as a
global energy player, finalizing the purchase of shares held by the
minority shareholders of International Power on June 29, 2012.

The shareholders’ agreement for SUEZ Environnement Company
expired on July 22, 2013 and was not renewed; the Group is
therefore refocusing on its energy activities. The cooperation and
shared functions agreement and the financing agreement between
GDF SUEZ and SUEZ Environnement Company have also come to
an end. GDF SUEZ now uses the equity method to consolidate
SUEZ Environnement Company's activities in its financial
statements, rather than full consolidation.

GDF SUEZ intends to maintain its role as a long-term strategic
partner of SUEZ Environnement Company and as its majority
shareholder. The guiding principles of the industrial and commercial
agreements between GDFSUEZ and SUEZ Environnement
Company were confirmed in January 2013, and form the basis of a
framework agreement between the two companies, similar to what
might have been concluded with third parties outside the Group.

(1) A PPA is an agreement between a purchaser (an entity in the public or private sector) and a power producer, with conditions for purchasing power
produced over a long period to ensure regular revenue for the producer that will cover its investment costs.

They relate to reciprocal preference, under market conditions, in
purchasing/sales, continuing cooperation in certain industrial
activities, development of potential joint commercial offerings and
cooperation in sustainable development, innovation and research
and development.

As well as this framework agreement, SUEZ Environnement
Company and GDF SUEZ signed temporary agreements in external
purchasing and information technology. In purchasing, SUEZ
Environnement Company aims to continue to benefit from
GDF SUEZ’s purchasing conditions until July 2015. A transition
agreement has been put in place for information technology that
allows SUEZ Environnement Company to continue to benefit, at its
sole request, from certain IT applications shared with the Group until
2014.

Lastly, the two companies have signed an additional clause on the
“SUEZ” brand license, which stipulates, inter alia, that “the two
parties shall undertake not to implement any measure, action or

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.1 PROFILE, ORGANIZATION AND STRATEGY OF THE GROUP

provision likely to affect the Brand’s validity, reputation or
recognition, and to comply with, and ensure compliance with, the
Ethics Charters that they have adopted, the regulations governing
their application and the national and international benchmark
legislation to which these charters refer”.

GDF SUEZ has its head office at 1, Place Samuel de Champlain,
92400 Courbevoie, France. Its phone number is
+33 (0) 1 44 22 00 00. GDF SUEZ is listed in the Paris Trades and
Companies Register under reference number 542 107 651. Its NAF

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.1 PROFILE, ORGANIZATION AND STRATEGY OF THE GROUP

The Company operates its own business; it has the organization of
an integrated industrial group. At the end of 2014, the number of
the Company's direct or indirect subsidiaries (controlling interest)
was approximately 1,600. The Group’s main consolidated
companies are listed in Section6.2 “Consolidated financial
statements - Note3 (List of main consolidated companies at
December 31, 2014)”. For a list of major subsidiaries and affiliates
directly owned by the Company, see Section 6.4 “Parent Company
financial statements — Note 23 (Subsidiaries and investments)”.

1.1.4 Strategic priorities

The markets in which the Group is expanding are currently

undergoing profound change:

m= increase in energy demand is concentrated in the fast growing
economies: 93% of the increase in primary energy consumption
between 2012 and 2040 will take place outside the OECD
countries, according to the International Energy Agency "’ (IEA);

™ natural gas is playing a more central role at global level: due to
abundant resources as unconventional gas production develops
(250 years of probable’ reserves), strong growth in demand
(+1.6% annually between 2012 and 2040") and an expanding
outlook for new uses (retail LNG, etc.);

= in Europe (EU 28) the energy transition has begun in many
countries: the contribution of renewable sources of energy
(excluding hydropower) to the energy mix will increase from 14%
to 35% between 2012 and 2040", and energy efficiency issues
are developing;

m™ energy will be increasingly managed at local level, and even
individually. “Consumer-players” are taking control of their
consumption and sometimes even generating power.

The economic slowdown in Europe and energy efficiency policies

have led to a fall in consumption which, in combination with

continuing development of renewable energy and plentiful cheap

coal, has generated surplus capacity and low electricity prices in the

long term. This situation has caused a significant crisis in thermal

power generation.

In view of this situation, the Group's two strategic priorities are:
1. to be the benchmark energy player in fast growing markets:

m by leveraging on strong positions in the independent power
generation, and in LNG, and by strengthening these positions,

m by building integrated positions all along the gas value chain,
including infrastructures,

m by developing energy services activities internationally;

2. to be leader in the energy transition in Europe:

m in renewable energies, thermal and electric, centralized and
distributed,

=m by offering energy efficiency services to its clients,

m by developing new businesses and expanding in digital.

In Europe, the Group has to adapt to the profound changes taking
place in the energy sector and increase the priority it gives to its
customer approach.

The presentation of the Company's activities and the strategic
economic assets of its main subsidiaries as well as_ their
geographical location are presented in Section 1.3 “Description of
business lines”.

The Group’s gas supply portfolio is undergoing an in-depth
restructuring process that involves optimizing its diversification and
renegotiating long-term contracts with its suppliers.

In power generation, the Group continues to optimize its fleet of
thermal power plants in response to the crisis in thermal generation,
and is campaigning for improvements in European regulations,
mainly through the Magritte Group", which is calling for measures
to preserve the energy future of Europe.

In renewable energy, the Group aims to pursue its development in
certain countries, with priority given to the more mature
technologies: hydropower, onshore wind power and biomass for
electricity and heat. Partnerships are being sought for these
projects.

In infrastructures activities, the aim is to adapt to the energy
transition context:

m by adapting infrastructures to changes in demand and new uses
(mobility, smart grids);

m by preparing infrastructure and commercial offerings for gas
being a vector for renewable energy (biomethane, power to gas,
etc.).

GDF SUEZ aims to strengthen its leadership in energy efficiency, as

the benchmark energy partner of its customers, businesses, local

authorities and individuals, emphasizing the technological content of
its activities to provide the most suitable global energy services
offering.

Internationally, GDF SUEZ aims to step up its development by

positioning itself right across the value chain and expanding the

range of businesses and regions.

GDF SUEZ aims to consolidate its current strong position in

independent power generation. Its strategic priorities in this area

are:

= strengthening its positions in countries where the Group is
present;

m™ investing in new, attractive markets;

m™ developing opportunities in renewable energy;

m™ exploring and extending its activities throughout the electricity and
gas value chain, including in decentralized generation and
infrastructure.

(2) The Magritte Group, of which GDF SUEZ is a founder member, is an initiative bringing together the CEOs of the 11 biggest energy groups in Europe
(CEZ Group, Enel, Eni, EON, Fortum, Gas Natural Fenosa, GasTerra, GDF SUEZ, Iberdrola and RWE) to lobby heads of state and government.

In the gas chain, the Group aims to rely on its expertise to roll out its
activities internationally, in an integrated way and with a focus on
countries with rapidly growing gas markets:

m™ developing upstream gas activities to secure access to resources
for the Group’s downstream markets, including power
generation;

™ capturing development opportunities in infrastructures;

m using its know-how in downstream activities to respond to
urbanization development in some countries.

The Group also aims to increase its international presence in energy
services.

To implement this strategy, GDF SUEZ adapted its organization in

2014, by:

™ creating a dedicated Generation Business Unit (BU) for thermal
power generation (gas, biomass, coal) in Europe and a
Renewable Energies BU within the Energy Europe business line;

m the project of uniting Cofely Services (Energy Services business
line) and BtoB activities of Energy France (Energy Europe
business line) in France, to build an integrated B2B energy
offering;

= creating a dedicated entity for innovation and new businesses at
Group level;

™ creating a cross-functional Digital Project to strengthen all of the
Group's entities in digital and adapt to new customer
requirements;

™ creating a China BU to develop a multi-activity offering that is
consistent with the country’s needs.

To become more agile and adapt to the trends in its environment,

the Group has been implementing a far-reaching action plan since

2014 that places human beings at the heart of its transformation in

three main areas:

m developing and advancing our
responsibilities, internal mobility);

= animating the Group and spreading its values;

employees (training,

™ enhancing performance to serve our customers (innovation,
managing complexity) and rolling out a new code of conduct for
managers, the “GDF SUEZ Management Way”.

On the financial front, the Group prioritizes maintaining a sound

financial structure in the long term (aiming to retain an “A” credit

rating), which will mainly be achieved through strict investment

criteria. GDF SUEZ’s financial objective is to offer its shareholders

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.1 PROFILE, ORGANIZATION AND STRATEGY OF THE GROUP

attractive returns while maintaining a solid financial structure and
robust cash flow generation. GDF SUEZ focuses on growth to
reinforce value creation, notably through a new dividend policy and
a boost in development Capex program (see section 6.1.1.8
“Qutlook”).

Within GDF SUEZ, environmental and societal responsibility plays an

integral part in drawing up business strategy, through the

development of:

m™ sustainable business, which involves identifying environmental
and societal issues and transforming them into opportunities for
the Group's businesses;

m= the management of non-financial risks, which involves managing
the risks associated with GDF SUEZ’s activities and facilities that
relate to the environment, local and international acceptability,
health and safety, human resources management, ethics and
governance.

GDF SUEZ has formalized its sustainable development

commitments, mainly through the publication of its policy in early

2014 and the following non-financial targets in 2011:

™ a specific CO, reduction target of 10% for its entire global power
and related heat generation fleet between 2012 and 2020.

m™ renewable energy: increasing installed capacity in renewables by
50% between 2009 and 2015;

= biodiversity: implementing a biodiversity action plan at each
sensitive site in the European Union by 2015;

= health and safety: achieving an accident frequency rate (FR) of
less than 4 in 2015;

= diversity: four targets by 2015:
- 1 in 3 senior managers appointed will be a woman,
- 25% of women executives,
- 30% of women in recruitments,
- 35% of high-potential women;
= training: maintaining a two-thirds level of employees receiving at
least one training per year;

m employee shareholding: achieving and maintaining a level of
employee shareholding in the company’s share capital of 3% by
2015.

In May 2014, GDF SUEZ issued a green bond for a total amount of

€2.5 billion. This bond loan will help to finance the Group's

development in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects

(see Section 5.1.6.5 “Green bond”).

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.1 PROFILE, ORGANIZATION AND STRATEGY OF THE GROUP

1.1.5 Improving performance

Perform 2015 was launched in 2012 to support the deployment of
the Group’s strategy and to improve its performance in a
sustainable manner. At the end of 2013, the overall gross target of
the program’ was increased to €4.5 billion cumulatively over the
2012-2015 period. This was motivated by the acceleration in the
Group’s transformation and to deal with an on-going difficult
economic environment in Europe.

The results of the Perform 2015 program in the 2014 financial
statements reflect the intended acceleration of the program as
announced in 2013.

In 2014, the Perform 2015 program had a gross positive impact of
€0.9 billion on income essentially associated with defined actions in
terms of operational efficiency and in particular, on the improvement
of margins and OPEX optimization. The portion affecting recurring
net income, Group share stood at €400 million. Furthermore, in
2014 the program enabled the generation of €400 million of
additional cash especially through the use of lean management
principles on maintenance CAPEX.

1.1.6 Competitive positioning

Electricity generation and marketing, as well as gas marketing are
business sectors that are broadly open to competition in Europe,
while their regulation continues to vary by country, especially when it
comes to prices for residential customers. Activities that constitute
natural monopolies — such as the transmission and distribution of
electricity and, to a large extent, of gas — are more tightly controlled
by domestic regulators and European rules.

Elsewhere in the world, with few exceptions, private players often
operate under long-term contracts issued on a tender basis.

GDF SUEZ is a European and world leader in electricity and natural
gas.

m in Europe, GDF SUEZ is the No. 3 seller”! of natural gas. In LNG,
GDF SUEZ is a global player. It is the No. 1 importer in Europe
and the No. 4 importer ® in the world. It is also a major player in
exploration-production (the only European energy company
positioned in every upstream activity);

= the Group is the leading gas infrastructure operator in Europe. It
has the No.2 transmission network, is No.1 in distribution,
European No. 1 in storage capacity (in terms of useful storage)
and the No.2 operator/owner of LNG terminals. It also owns
Turkey’s No. 3 gas distributor;

=: in electricity, the merger of GDF SUEZ and International Power
created the world’s leading independent power producer (IPP).

The year was marked by the widening of operational review
methods, including Purchasing, to all the Group’s conventional
gas-turbine power plants in Europe, and the start of deployment of
this methodology to plants outside Europe.

The Purchasing initiative was reinforced Group-wide by new
governance and by the implementation of Category Management
across all Business Lines.

The Shared Services project launched in 2013 covering France and
Belgium has become a division in its own right. The objective of this
new entity is to provide the Group with a solid, integrated base for
support services thanks to the harmonization of organizations,
processes and practices of transactional activities.

The optimization and simplification of working methods is being
pursued as for example through a project dedicated to the
optimization of demand in IT services, including the streamlining and
standardization of IT infrastructure within the Group’s operations in
Europe.

The transaction also reinforces the Group’s international standing

as the No. 1 producer-developer in the Gulf States, the No. 1 IPP

in Brazil and Thailand, No. 2 in Peru and No.3 in Chile. The

Group is the No. 6 producer” and the No. 6 supplier” in Europe.
This global and European leadership is fortified by the Group's deep
Franco-Belgian roots:

= in France, GDF SUEZ is the historic leader of gas marketing and
the No. 2 producer and supplier® of electricity. In renewable
energy, GDF SUEZ is the No. 2 hydropower operator in France
and the leader in wind power;
= in Belgium, GDF SUEZ, through its subsidiary Electrabel, is the
No. 1 producer and supplier of electricity” and the No. 1 supplier
of natural gas“.
The Group is also the European leader in B2B energy services: the
Energy Services business line is ranked joint No. 1° in France,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy, according to its various
activities. GDF SUEZ also has strong positions in Germany,
Switzerland, Austria, Spain and the UK in heating networks (where it
is No. 1), as well as facility management since the acquisition of
Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. Lastly, it has set up the initial bases for
development in Central Europe, Asia, North America and Latin
America.

(1) The term “gross” applies specifically to the component of the objective relating to operating costs, thus €2.6 billion for the program. A gross gain is by
nature recurring, from which implementation costs are deducted but prior to inflation, other costs and taxes.

12.22 Natural gas portfolio

Most of the Group's natural gas is supplied via one of the most
diversified portfolios of long-term contracts in Europe, sourced from
more than 10 countries. These contracts give GDF SUEZ the
necessary visibility to ensure its development and secure its
supplies. GDF SUEZ is also one of the biggest spot market players
in Europe. It can therefore rationalize its supply costs by adjusting its
purchasing to match its needs.

power generation fleet has a low carbon footprint, with an average
331 kg of CO.-eq./MWh recorded for Europe in 2013, within the
328kg of CO,-eq/MWh European average estimated by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) over 2013.

Worldwide, emissions from the Group's generation fleet evaluated in
2013 were 425 kg of CO,-eq/MWh.

The GDF SUEZ portfolio, which represents approximately
1,296 TWh (calculated at group share", or about 120 billion m®, is
among the most diversified in the world. LNG represents about 15%
of the portfolio, increased to a 30% share on the long-term
contracts portfolio.

1.2.3. Extra-financial indicators

The Group’s non-financial performance is based on dated and
quantified targets (see Section 1.1.4. “Strategic priorities”) and an
overall assessment organized around different resources (high level
of governance, reporting, scorecard, performance reviews and
non-financial indicators).

That monitoring is done at several levels of the Group. The Board of
Directors’ Ethics, Environment and Sustainable Development
Committee (see Section 4. Corporate governance) defines the
scope of the policies undertaken, outlooks and action plans in the
area of corporate societal responsibility. The Group’s Management
Committee (see Section 4. Corporate governance) makes key
decisions in this area. The role of the Group’s Environmental and
Societal Responsibility Executive Committee" is to prepare annual
action plans, monitor their implementation, gather experiences
across the various entities and encourage exchange on major
strategies (including the fight against climate change and corporate
social responsibility).

An extra-financial scorecard made up of key indicators covering the
three bases of Societal and Environmental Responsibility is
presented to the Group’s Management Committee for approval and
future direction, then to the Ethics, Environment and Sustainable
Development Committee to provide a progress report on

implementation of the policy and achievement of the Group’s
extra-financial objectives.

In 2014, GDF SUEZ shows results perfectly consistent with the
Objectives and their schedule, in particular for the reduction in
specific CO, emissions (see Section 3.3.4.1. “Climate change”), the
doubling of installed capacity in renewable energy (vs. 2009) and the
frequency rate (see Section 3.2.6 “Health and Safety Policy”). Some
targets are already reached, like the Employee Training level and the
goal regarding employee shareholders (see
Section 3.2.5.”Employee shareholding”).

In its investment projects, the Group incorporates ten extra-financial
criteria relating to ethics, CO, emissions, social impact, human
resources, environmental management of ecosystems, cooperation
with stakeholders, local purchasing, and health and safety.
Furthermore, the Group takes a CO, cost into account for its
investments.

The Group’s social reporting (see Section 3.2 “Social information”),
environmental reporting (see Section 3.3 “Environmental
information”) and societal reporting (see Section 3.4 “Corporate
societal commitments”), form the basis of a published Group of
indicators that are verified by an independent third party.

1.3.16 Description of activities

1.3.1.6.1 Central Western Europe

Central Energy Management Trading (Central EMT)
Energy Management Trading (EMT) is designed to structure the
portfolio of assets (physical and contractual), negotiate the
corresponding contracts, optimize the management of these assets,
and provide support to the Group’s commercial operations in
Europe.

The EMT Métier is structured around four activities: Portfolio & Risk
Management (PRM), Optimization & Prompt (O&P), Origination &
Sales Support (OSS), and Trading. Some of these activities are
carried out by GDF SUEZ Trading (GST) and GDF SUEZ Energy
Management Trading (GSEMT).

EMT mainly operates for the Energy Europe business line and also
acts for other Group business lines, chiefly in exploration and
production, LNG, and coal supply.

Portfolio and Risk Management (PRM)

The business line manages several assets throughout Europe:
power plants, virtual power plants, gas and electricity sourcing or
supply contracts, transmission capacity, storage __ rights,
regasification capacity, etc.

PRM develops an integrated, multi-year policy for these assets and
defines strategies to reduce the price risks associated with them.
This policy is then implemented by the Optimization and Prompt
teams. PRM helps to optimize the portfolio’s risk/reward profile and
to ensure the profitability of the assets.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

Optimization and Prompt (O&P)

Within the scope of the Business Line’s risk policy, O&P optimizes
the gas and electricity portfolios over different time horizons, using a
wide variety of models. Exposure to price and volume risks is
gradually reduced until physical delivery, by systematic transfer to
Trading, while ensuring sufficient capacity to handle fluctuations in
production, supply and consumption.

GDF Suez has the legal obligation, as with all natural gas suppliers,
to supply all its French customers without a contingency clause: to
be able to provide physical delivery in the event of severe weather
conditions that statistically occur no more than twice a century —
known as “2% risk”.

O&P identifies flexibility in the portfolio in order to structure it as
options and market products to be transferred to Trading.

O&P also manages all logistics (transmission and storage capacity,
etc.) until physical delivery of energy to the various operators.

Origination and Sales Support (OSS)

OSS is responsible for the energy supply to the commercial entities
of Marketing & Sales, commercial relations with counterparties
(excluding market counterparties), mainly gas suppliers, and the sale
of electricity and gas to large industrial customers (Giant account).

Long-term gas contracts

OSS purchases natural gas under long-term contracts from the
main suppliers in Europe. The aim of the supply strategy is to
ensure the competitiveness of the portfolio and security of supply to
the Group’s customers, mainly through geographical diversification
of resources and constant adaptation of the portfolio to the market
situation.

In line with market practice, long-term procurement contracts
contain volume clauses: minimum volumes to be taken in a period
(take-or-pay), transfer of withdrawals to a later period (make-up), or
deduction of volumes withdrawn against a prior period (carry
forward).

The contracts contain clauses that enable periodic revision of price
according to changes in the market, either on a regular basis or by
way of exception. The parties are then required to negotiate in good
faith and may, in the event of disagreement, revert to arbitration.

In 2014, EMT continued to renegotiate contracts with its main
suppliers to adapt these contracts to new market conditions. As of
December 31, 2014, over 50% of the long-term contract portfolio
volumes in Europe were indexed based on references to the price of
gas sold on marketplaces.

Global Energy

Global Energy is the Energy Europe's entity in charge of sales of
gas, electricity and associated services to national and
pan-European large industrial customers. Global Energy develops
full supply offers (commodity, flexibility, balancing and delivery),
market products (blocks delivered to the hub or financial products),
price consultancy and risk management solutions, under the GDF
SUEZ Global Energy brand. This entity, created on July 1, 2014
from the merger of teams from Energy Management Trading and
Marketing & Sales, established a new commercial strategy and has
since launched a transformation and performance plan.

Own commercial activity with market counterparties

OSS is also developing its own commercial activity for customers
active on the wholesale market (e.g. other energy groups, major
consumers directly active in the markets, banks, etc.).

Trading

Trading provides the business line with access to all energy
markets: electricity and gas, oil and petroleum products, coal,
biomass, CO, emissions, and foreign currency markets.

Trading helps to optimize assets by managing positions from O&P
in the markets, and supports the commercial operations of OSS.
Trading also develops proprietary trading operations within lower
risk limits.

Lastly, Trading is in charge of international trading activities, as well
as of the physical procurement of coal and biomass for the power
plants of GDF SUEZ Energy Europe and a portion of those of the
Energy International business line.

GDF SUEZ Trading (GST) and GDF SUEZ Energy
Management Trading (GSEMT)

The market activities of O&P, OSS and Trading are carried out by
GDF SUEZ Trading, a subsidiary with “investment services provider”
status, in which capacity it is supervised by the banking and
financial authorities and by GDF SUEZ Energy Management
Trading.

These two structures are wholly owned by the Group. EMT’s
activities have a dedicated and specialized risk control system, with
teams responsible for defining risk assessment procedures,
proposing credit and market limits, monitoring risk assessment
tools, and monitoring market risks on a daily basis.

The system is incorporated in GDF SUEZ’s governance through an
EMT Risk Committee (EMTRC) comprising senior managers of
GDF SUEZ Trading and representatives of the Group and the
business line. EMTRC monitors all risks to which EMT is exposed.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

Market risks (commodity prices, FOREX rates and interest rate risks)
and physical risks (asset failure risks) are monitored based on VaR
(value at risk) and stress test models.

Regarding credit risks, lines of credit are allocated counterparty by
counterparty. These risks are reduced through the use of various
tools: netting agreements and margin calls, obtaining on-demand
guarantees, parent company guarantees, and transaction clearing.

Operational risks are managed by a specialized team that ensures
systematic improvement in internal procedures.

Liquidity risk is assessed by stress tests.

General Management and EMTRC are automatically notified if a limit
is overrun.

The efficiency of the risk control framework is regularly tested in
audits.

The risk control framework for market activities is part of this system
and meets all the regulatory requirements.

France

The Energy Europe business line has a firm base in France where it
operates a large portfolio of activities: power generation from
thermal plants and renewables, sales of natural gas and electricity,
as well as household energy services.

The Generation Métier operates four combined-cycle gas plants in
France. Three units (Montoir-de-Bretagne, Combigolfe and Cycofos)
have been under summer or annual mothballing since April 2013.

The Renewable Energies Métier is responsible for the Group's
development in this domain. In 2014, GDF SUEZ increased its
capacity in France by 154 MW, comprising 89 MW from onshore.
wind farms, 7MW = from  hydroelectricity, and 58MW_ from
photovoltaic solar. In December 2013, GDF SUEZ signed a strategic
partnership agreement with Crédit Agricole Assurances, which
acquired a 50% stake in Futures Energies Investissement Holding
(FEIH) through its subsidiary, Predica. The transaction will combine
FEIH’s wind asset development goals and optimization of its
financial structure. Following an invitation to tender for photovoltaic
solar issued in 2013, GDF SUEZ was awarded a contract for 10
new projects in April 2014. In marine renewable energy, the Group
filed plans for the two zones included in the second offshore wind
power tender (Dieppe - Le Tréport and Noirmoutier - lle d’Yeu),
with EDPR, Neoen Marine and AREVA as turbine provider, and won
the contract in May 2014. GDF SUEZ is also positioned in tidal
energy and its Raz Blanchard project won in December 2014 the
call for expressions of interest in “Pilot Tidal Energy Farms” from the
ADEME (Agence de |’Environnement et de la Maitrise de I’Energie -
French agency for the environment and the control of energy), with
its partner Alstom.

maintenance of equipment (leader in maintenance, with 1.4 million
contracts). The Group is meeting the needs of residential customers
and consolidating its leading position in energy efficiency, especially
through its GDF SUEZ Dolce Vita range of offers and the
development of solutions driven by the B2C services division
(primarily through Savelys). GDF SUEZ is also meeting the emerging
requirements of its B2B customers with new offers (biomethane and
LNG delivered by tank truck).

Regulatory framework

Regulation of administrative tariffs

Fifty-six percent of GDF SUEZ’s total gas sales are priced on the
basis of tariffs established by the government through various laws,
decrees and regulatory decisions.

Sale price of natural gas

GDF SUEZ sells natural gas on the basis of two pricing systems:
regulated tariffs and negotiated prices for customers who have
opted out of regulated tariffs in favor of market offers from energy
suppliers.

Administrative tariffs
There are two types of administrative tariffs:

= public distribution tariffs for customers who consume less than
5 GWh per year and are connected to the distribution network
(7.6 million customers”; 112.3 TWh sold in 2014);

= subscription rates for customers who consume more than 5 GWh
per year and are connected either to the distribution network or
directly to the transmission network (227 customers®, 2.2 TWh
sold in 2014).

Elimination of administrative tariffs for business customers

Article 11a of the Consumer Rights bill provides for the gradual
extinction of administrative tariffs for natural gas sales to
non-residential customers, according to a staggered schedule
running from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2015. By this
deadline, apart from individuals, only small co-owned properties
(using less than 150 MWh per year) and small businesses (using
less than 30MWh per year) can continue to benefit from

(1) Excluding large industrial customers.

(2) Average on a yearly basis.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

administrative tariffs. In mid-December, this extinction measure
involved approximately 119,000 customers (80 TWh).

Rate-setting procedure

Rates are set in France under the Energy Act and the decree of
December 18, 2009, as amended on May 16, 2013, related to
administrative tariffs for natural gas sales. These provisions state
that prices must cover corresponding costs. The regulator
(Commission de Régulation de |’Energie - CRE) audits supply and
non-supply costs for GDFSUEZ every year, and makes
recommendations for rate changes accordingly. On July 1 each
year, the government publishes an order setting out the formula
representing the changes in supply costs and the rate levels. Since
July 1, 2014, the pricing formula includes a market indexation of
60%, the remainder being pegged to oil product indices and to the
euro-dollar exchange rate.

In the interval between any two governmental orders, GDF SUEZ,
after advice from the CRE, can pass on changes in supply costs
resulting from the application of the pricing formula. If there is an
exceptional rise in oil or natural gas products, the government may
issue an order, after advice from the CRE, temporarily setting rates
that are lower than the costs of GDF SUEZ for a period of no more
than one year.

Following the French Council of State cancellation in 2012 and 2013
of the price freezes decided by the government in 2011 and 2012,
GDF SUEZ is currently issuing retroactive invoices. These have been
staggered to limit their impact on customers. The partial freeze in
the 2011 administrative tariffs led to a price gap between
consumers (residential use and non-residential use). The gap was
denounced in several appeals by the French association of retail
energy operators (Association Nationale des Opérateurs Détaillants
en Energie - ANODE) which the Council of State upheld in 2013.
The government is now implementing the Council of State’s ruling,
which will have a limited effect on GDF SUEZ, as the repayments of
overcharged amounts will be balanced out by GDF SUEZ’s invoicing
of undercharged amounts.

Since the start of 2014 (12 monthly changes), administrative tariffs
and public distribution rates have decreased by 1.8%.
Administrative tariff subscription rates (four quarterly changes) fell by
1.5%.

Belgium-Luxembourg

In Belgium, GDF SUEZ’s wholly owned subsidiary Electrabel is the
leading player in the power sector.

At year-end 2014, the Generation Métier operated a capacity
exceeding 9,462 MW, including 4,134 MW in nuclear power units
(including drawing rights), and 3,231 MW in natural gas-fired
thermal power plants.

On March 25, 2014, GDF SUEZ decided, as a precautionary
measure and in accordance with its culture of high nuclear safety, to
temporary outage the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear plants. This.
decision was made in the wake of tests carried out under the action
plan linked to the restart of the two reactors in June 2013.
Electrabel submitted the initial results of the analyses of the tests
conducted over several months to the Belgian Federal Agency for
Nuclear Control, which has asked Electrabel to supplement its file
with additional information, and introduced a number of
suggestions. Once the entire file has been submitted and analyzed,
the Agency will decide on authorization for the restart. Outage
period has been extended until July 1, 2015.

On August 5, 2014, the Doel 4 nuclear power plant went into
automatic shutdown, in a completely safe manner and in line with
planned procedures, in response to an oil leak in the steam turbine
in the non-nuclear part of the plant, resulting from a deliberate act.
The Doel 4 plant was safely restarted on December 19, 2014, two
weeks ahead of schedule.

The 95 MW Awirs 4 plant was mothballed for the summer between
April and September 2014. In Luxembourg, the Group operates the
Twinerg 376 MW gas power plant at Esch-sur-Alzette, which had
been mothballed between April and September 2014.

The Renewable Energies Métier is now directing an onshore wind
capacity of 175 MW. In addition, six new projects in Flanders,
representing a total installed capacity of 40 MW, were initiated in the
fourth quarter of 2014. These projects are due to be commissioned
by the end of 2015. The Mermaid consortium, in which Electrabel
has a 35% stake, completed the transfer to Northwester 2 of just
under half the concession granted to build an offshore farm of
450-490 MW off the Belgian coast. The transaction reduces both
the operational and financial risks associated with the project. The
project’s development is underway and applications are in-process
for various permits.

The Marketing & Sales Métier has a large portfolio of business
customers (industrial and tertiary sectors), mainly for the supply of
electricity and natural gas, with volumes sold in 2014 of 13.5 TWh
and 12.1 TWh'" respectively, as well as energy services. The market
share in B2B has stabilized since 2013 thanks to price repositioning
and a new sales and marketing approach, although competition
remained very aggressive. Marketing & Sales is also active in the
retail market, with approximately 2.7 million electricity contracts and
1.4 million natural gas contracts. Customer loss decreased
substantially in this market from 2013 onwards, thanks to a range of
practical initiatives, such as price repositioning for all customers,
marketing and media campaigns, and performance actions. Lastly,
Marketing & Sales is developing an innovative range of products
and services aimed at all customer segments.

(1) Excluding large industrial customers.

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

In 2014, Electrabel and the public partners in Flanders signed and
executed an agreement to end their collaboration in the mixed
distribution system operators (DSOs) and Electrabel Customer
Solutions (ECS); Electrabel thus sold its stake in the DSOs to the
public partners and bought the public partners’ shares in ECS.

In Wallonia, a memorandum of understanding was signed to enable
exit of ECS capital by the public partners, effective from
December 31, 2014. This agreement also provides for the possibility
of Electrabel’s early withdrawal from Ores Assets” on
December 31, 2016, originally planned for the end of 2019,
according to initially agreed valuation principles. A finalization
agreement is due to be drafted before April 1, 2015.

Regulatory framework

After three months of negotiation, the new Belgian federal
government was sworn in on October 11, 2014.

Nuclear power generation

GDF SUEZ, EDF, and the Belgian government signed an agreement
in March 2014 governing the extension of the lifetime of the
Tihange 1 nuclear plant: the investment program to safely continue
operating this plant through 2025 is being implemented. A sharing
mechanism applicable as of October 2015 has also been signed
with the Belgian federal government and EDF, in substitution of fixed
nuclear contribution.

To ensure a secure supply, the federal government decided at the
end of 2014 to extend the term of operation of the Doel 1 and
Doel 2 nuclear plants by 10 years. Negotiations began in
January 2015 between Electrabel and the Belgian federal
government on the conditions required for the investments
necessary to prolong the plant's operating lifetine, especially the
necessity for a detailed and stable economic and legal framework,
notably taking into account the issue of the nuclear contribution with
regard to the tax burden on operational activities in Belgium. Until an
agreement is reached, the Doel1 nuclear power plant was
disconnected from the grid on February 15, 2015 in accordance
with the law of December 18, 2013 which specified its closure after
40 years of operation.

For 2014, Electrabel was liable for a nuclear contribution of
€407 million®.

The various legal actions pursued in Belgium against the nuclear
contribution are still pending to date (see detail in Note 28.1.10 of
Section 6.2 "Consolidated financial statements").

In September 2014, Electrabel filed a lawsuit to the European
Commission claiming that the nuclear contribution from 2008 to
2013 constituted illegal state aid from the Belgian state to the
electricity producers not subject to these contributions. The lawsuit,
which was extended to include 2014 nuclear contributions, is
currently under review by the EC.

(2) Ores Assets is an electricity and natural gas aistributor created from the merger of eight Wallonian intercommunales mixtes (utilities owned by private

and public stakeholders).

(3) Net contribution being €397 million.

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

Thermal power generation
The government also intends to study the establishment of capacity

remuneration mechanisms, although the exact scope and
implementation details are not known at this stage. At the end of
December 2014, the regulator (Commission de Régulation de
lElectricité. et du Gaz - CREG) was charged to make a
recommendation to ensure the survival of the existing gas-fired
plants.

End market

An energy standard will be instituted, the aim being to ensure that
the different components in the energy price are not higher in
Belgium than its neighboring countries in order to safeguard
companies’ competitive position and consumer purchasing power.
As the price comparison methodology has not yet been set, it is not
possible at this stage to accurately position Belgian prices against
the prices applied in its neighboring countries. Price regulation, with
a Safety net, will also be extended by one year, renewable three
times.

Germany

The Energy Europe business line operates in Germany through the
subsidiary GDF SUEZ Energie Deutschland AG.

The Generation Métier currently operates 2,653 MW of thermal
capacity in Germany, of which 822 MW comes from the Farge and
Zolling power plants (mainly coal), 602.5 MW from nuclear drawing
rights and 451 MW from cogeneration plants owned and operated
by municipal utilities (Energieversorgung GeraGmbH and
Kraftwerke Gera GmbH, EnergieSaarlLorLux AG, WSW Energie &
Wasser AG, GASAG Berliner Gaswerke AG). The new supercritical
731 MW coal-fired plant at Wilhelmshaven, in which GDF SUEZ has
a 57% stake, was connected to the grid for the first time in 2014.
Commissioning tests are presently finalized. Due to the challenging
context for conventional generation, political discussions on a major
revision of the institutional framework are ongoing.

The Renewable Energies Métier is studying investment possibilities
in onshore wind with the Group’s municipal partners. At the end of
2014, it operated installed onshore wind capacity of 196 MW and
hydroelectric pumping facilities of 182 MW.

The Marketing & Sales Métier operates on most customer
segments. B2B sales increased to 11.8 TWh of electricity and
5 TWh of natural gas. The Group is also active in the sale and
distribution of electricity, gas and heat to residential and small
business customers, with a total of over 0.1 million electricity
customers and nearly 0.1 million gas customers" through its
cooperation with municipal utilities.

Netherlands

GDF SUEZ is a leading player in the Dutch energy market through
its subsidiary GDF SUEZ Energie Nederland.

At year-end 2014 the Generation Métier operated an installed
capacity of 4,394 MW, comprised of several gas-fired power plants,

(1) Including equity-accounted entities.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

a coal/biomass plant, and gas turbines. The new supercritical
coal-fired plant in Rotterdam, with a capacity of 731 MW,
connected to the grid since 2014, has taken up commercial
operation as of 29 January 2015. Due to difficult market conditions,
GDF SUEZ Energie Nederland’s position in centralized generation is
under heavy pressure, leading to the dismantling of Flevo (119 MW)
and a strong focus on operational efficiency at the other power
plants. In 2013, the government and participants of the Social and
Economic Council (SER) reached an energy agreement on
“sustainable growth”. The agreement also provides for the closure
of several coal-fired plants (including Nijmegen, wholly owned by the
Group) by January 1, 2016. In addition, it provides for the coal tax
to be abolished for the remaining coal units by January 1, 2016.

GDF SUEZ is expanding in renewable energies and decentralized
generation solutions for residential customers. At the end of 2014,
the Renewable Energies Métier operated 56 MW of onshore wind
(the regulatory framework sets MW targets for each region).

The Marketing & Sales Métier is also active on the Dutch market.
Through Electrabel, it supplies gas and power to more than
0.5 million retail customers. In the B2B segment, GDF SUEZ is a
major supplier with 6 TWh of electricity and 6 TWh of gas sold.

1,3.1.6.2 Eastern and Southern Europe

Poland

The Energy Europe business line is present in Poland via its
subsidiary GDF SUEZ Energia Polska, which is mainly active in
power generation.

At year-end 2014, the Generation Métier operated 1,700 MW,
comprising coal-fired capacity in Polaniec of 1,510 MW and
capacity of 190 MW for the Green Unit biomass facility, which is one
of the largest biomass units in the world. GDF SUEZ Energia Polska
is currently renovating seven generation units, with the aim of
increasing their capacity and efficiency, as well as to ensure they
comply with the European Industrial Emissions Directive. Units 1, 2
and 7 were modernized in 2013 and units 3 and 6 in 2014.

The Renewable Energies Métier has 102 MW of installed onshore
wind power, spread over the sites of Jar Moltowo, Wartkowo, and
Pagow. The renewable energy regulatory environment is set to
change significantly. Current government proposals include the
introduction of a 15 year feed-in tariff granted through an auction
system (joint auctions for all technologies with a maximum price per
technology). Existing assets will be separated from new assets and
will have a choice to stay within current green certificates (GC)
system or participate in dedicated auctions. Co-firing will continue
to utilize the GC system with support reduced by 50%.

The Marketing & Sales Métier focuses on the sale of electricity to
B2B customers (0.4 TWh sold in 2014).

Hungary
The Energy Europe business line operates in Hungary through the
subsidiaries GDF SUEZ Energy Hungary and Egaz-Dégaz
Féldgazeloszt6 (100% subsidiary via EIH, wholly owned by
GDF SUEZ).

In June 2014, GDF SUEZ sold its interest in the Dunamenti plant
(1,041 MW), so the Group is no longer active in power generation in
Hungary.

GDF SUEZ Energy Hungary also sells natural gas to B2B and B2C
customers and electricity to B2B customers. Egaz-Dégaz is the
natural gas distrioutor which, as of 2014, operates a 23,133 km
long distribution network and distributes 12.6 TWh of natural gas to
772,790 customers. Regulation is a key concern in Hungary. End
user tariffs have been reduced, by law, by 20%. The regulated rate
of return of Distribution System Operators has been cut to zero (for
households) and several costs are not recognized in the tariff. The
Hungarian government is also planning to establish a not-for-profit
centralized services provider for the supply of gas, electricity and
water, and for waste treatment.

Romania

The Energy Europe business line is present in Romania via its
subsidiary GDF SUEZ Energy Romania SA (GSER), which is
responsible for the sale and distribution of natural gas and
expanding its activities in power.

Since the end of 2013, the Renewable Energies Métier has
managed two wind farms, for installed capacity of 98 MW. These
farms are located in Gemenele (Braila region) and Baleni (Galati
region). The regulatory framework deteriorated over the year, having
a negative impact on the profitability of wind assets.

The core activity consists of supplying gas to 1.5 million customers
located mostly in the southern part of the country. GSER also
supplies electricity to about 1,600 industrial and commercial
customers. Its subsidiary Distrigaz Sud Retele operates a 18,423 km
long distribution network. In July 2014, GSER finalized the purchase
of CONGAZ, the third-largest gas distributor and supplier in
Romania. CONGAZ supplies gas to 62,835 customers and operates
a 921 km long distribution network. GDF SUEZ Energy Romania is
also active in the energy services sector serving 645,000 customers.
through its affiliate Distrigaz Confort, with a focus on maintenance of
internal installations. Energy Europe is also present in natural gas
storage, mainly through its subsidiary Depomures, which has a total
working capacity of 300 million cubic meters.

Romania is in the midst of deregulating electricity and gas prices.
The gas price for the industrial (B2B) sector was deregulated in

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

January 2015. For the residential segment (B2C), the price should
be fully deregulated by July 1, 2021. GSER continues to encourage
the authorities for an optimum transition to a deregulated gas
market and a rebalance of their support mechanism for renewable
energies.

Austria

GDF SUEZ is active in the Austrian natural gas market through its
commercial subsidiary GDF SUEZ Gasvertrieb, which sells gas to
large industrial consumers, other business customers, and resellers.
GDF SUEZ Gasvertrieb also provides balancing services to various
market participants. The gas volumes sold amount to 2.4 TWh.

Czech Republic

GDF SUEZ is present in the Czech natural gas market through its
commercial subsidiary GDF SUEZ Prodej plynu, which focuses on
selling gas to large industrial users and other business customers.
The gas volumes sold amount to 1.9 TWh.

Italy-Greece

Energy Europe operates in power generation and energy sales in
Italy through GDF SUEZ Energia Italia S.p.A.

The Generation Métier directly operates 1,526 MW in Italy (through
majority stakes in thermal assets) and holds a 50% stake in Tirenno
Power S.p.A, which manages 3,276 MW. Energy Europe also holds
1,100 MW of drawing rights. In 2014, the Group’s stake in the
532-MW ISAB Energy plant was sold. Vado Ligure units 3 and 4,
coal-fired and owned by Tirreno Power, were shut down in March
by order of the court of Savona. The Italian Environment Minister
subsequently suspended authorization to operate these units.
Proposals to restart them under an accelerated authorization
procedure are still under discussion between Tirreno Power and the
authorities. Due to the challenging context for conventional
generation, political discussions on a major revision of the
institutional framework are ongoing.

The Renewable Energies Métier also manages 157.5 MW of wind
assets and 5.3 MW of photovoltaic assets. In addition, the Group
manages 74.5 MW of hydraulic facilities through Tirreno Power.

The Marketing & Sales Métier sells gas and electricity to different
market segments, (residential and business), for a total of
one million contracts, of which 0.1 million are dual offers (electricity
and gas).

In Greece, Energy Europe is mainly present through two joint
ventures with GEK TERNA (Greek private company) in Heron |
and Il, for a total capacity of 570 MW. The business line is also
active in the B2B electricity market.

1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

Spain

In Spain, Energy Europe is active in power generation, energy
management, and sales (power, gas & bidding services for third
parties).

The Generation Métier has an installed net capacity in Spain of
1,973 MW with two natural gas combined-cycle power plants:
Castelnou Energia (774 MW) and GDF SUEZ Energia Cartagena
(1,199 MW). The energy of both power plants is sold on the
wholesale market. Since 2014, Energy Europe has operated
hydroelectric (65.1 MW) and solar (1.2 MW) assets, transferred from
Energy International.

Marketing & Sales activity is focused on the industrial market with
3.4 TWh sold in gas and 2.8 TWh in electricity.

The main difficulty facing the Spanish electricity system is the tariff
deficit. Measures have been taken in recent years to eliminate it.

Portugal

Energy Europe's activities in Portugal are mainly focused on power
generation and natural gas distribution.

The Generation Métier has an installed thermal power capacity of
2,406 MW, of which 1,830 MW comes from combined-cycle plants
and 576 MW from a coal-fired plant.

The Renewable Energies Métier also manages 942 MW from
renewable assets (mainly wind) through interests in companies such
as Lusovento Holding B.V. and Generg SGPS.

Additionally to power generation, Energy Europe has natural gas
distribution activities through a 25.4% stake in Portgas, which
markets and distributes natural gas and propane in a concession in
Northern Portugal.

1.3.2 Energy International business line

13.21 Role

The GDF SUEZ Energy International business line is responsible for
the Group's energy activities outside Europe". The business line is
currently present in 27 countries across five regions worldwide.
Together with power generation, it is also active in closely linked
businesses including downstream LNG, gas distribution, water
desalination and energy retail. The business line has a strong
presence in its markets with 73.9 GW® in operation and a significant
programme of 10.1 GW® of projects under construction as at
December 31, 2014.

13.22 Strategy

Generating value for the long-term is central to the business model.
To achieve this, GDF SUEZ Energy International uses a portfolio
management approach, which involves maintaining a balanced
portfolio in terms of geographical spread, business activity,
generation fuels, technologies and contract types. This approach
provides access to multiple opportunities, whilst mitigating risks
through diversification.

The four main strategic priorities of the business line are:

m= Pursue growth in fast growing markets: Strengthen positions in
existing markets and be considered a local player. Capture
opportunities in attractive new markets with a mix of
technologies, including new opportunities along the energy value
chain. Develop renewable sources of energy where economically
viable.

(1) Except the activities in the UK-Turkey region.

= Optimize the value of the portfolio: Pursue a more integrated
business model with a “system-play” approach”. Target
synergies that will allow cost reductions and achieve scale effects
in operations. Relocation of capital in projects that offer
superior retums.

= Optimize assets: Deliver successfully the construction program
and achieve operational optimization, always ensuring a safe
working environment for all employees.

= Explore opportunities for business diversification: Capture growth
in new markets and new activities along the energy value chain.
Identify and enter new business opportunities in related business,
including decentralized generation and full solutions for clients.

13.2.3 Organizational structure

The Energy International business line has five key regions: Latin
America, North America, UK-Turkey, South Asia, Middle East &
Africa (SAMEA) and Asia-Pacific. The business line headquarters are
based in London and Brussels, with respective regional
headquarters in Santiago, Houston, London, Dubai and Bangkok.

Each region is headed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who is
responsible for the financial performance and operational activities in
the region, and proposes strategic orientations and new
development actions.

The business line follows a matrix organization structure, which
provides the regional teams with both the flexibility and the
responsibility to run and develop their businesses, while the
functional support teams ensure direction and consistency, and
help optimize synergies across the regions and the Group.

(2) GW and MW always stand for the maximum net technical capacity of the power plants, which corresponds to the gross power less auto
consumption. Installed capacity corresponds to 100% of the total capacity of all interests held by GDF SUEZ irrespective of the actual percentage

stake of the holding.

(3) Projects under construction include the projects not yet under construction but for which the company is contractually bound to build or acquire.

(4) A system-play approach is an approach which seeks to create industrial synergies alongside our investments in power generation through investing in
closely linked businesses, such as LNG terminals, gas distribution and energy retail (largely for commercial and industrial customers).

m Latin America - GDF SUEZ has been successful in the energy
auction in Chile. The Group will lead the construction of the
375 MW IEM thermal power plant and an associated port, as well
as a transmission line (TEN) that will connect the SIC (central
electricity system) and the SING (northern electricity system).

13.2.6 Regional overview

1.3.2.6.1 GDF SUEZ Energy Latin America

GDF SUEZ Energy Latin America (GSELA) manages the Group's
gas and electricity activities in Latin America. GSELA is organized
into five countries: Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and Argentina. It
manages 14,180 MW of capacity in operation and 3,267 MW of
capacity under construction. In December 2014, the assets in
Central America were sold.

Brazil

In Brazil, GSELA’s existing power assets and the development of
selected small and medium sized power plants are managed by
Tractebel Energia (TBLE), the country’s largest independent
electricity producer (approximately 7% of Brazil’s installed capacity),
which is 68.7% owned by GDF SUEZ. TBLE shares are traded on
the Brazilian stock exchange. The company operates a total
installed capacity of 8,666 MW.

(1) Closing of the sale of 20% stake to Mitsui took place in January 2014.

Energia Sustentavel do Brasil (ESBR) holds the concession contract
to build, own and operate the 3,750 MW Jirau hydropower project.
ESBR is owned by GSELA (40%), Mitsui (20%"", Eletrosul (20%) and
Chesf (20%). 30-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) have
been signed with distribution companies for the off-take of 73% of
the project's 2,185 MW assured energy production. The remaining
assured energy will be sold to the shareholders GSELA, Eletrosul
and CHESF®. At the end of 2014, the project had started
commercial operation of the 22° unit, bringing the total installed
capacity connected to the national grid to 1,650 MW. In line with the
prevailing business model, GDF SUEZ stake in Jirau will be
transferred to Tractebel Energia when main development risks have
been mitigated.

On the regulatory side, the most important recent measures were
the release of the Provisory Measure 579 in October 2012 (turned
into law 12.783/13), the Resolution CNPE 03 in March 2013 and
the Resolution 1832 in November 2014:

m law 12.783/13 introduced new rules for the renewal of
hydropower projects and transmission line concessions which
expired from 2013. This new regulation has two main elements:
concession extensions and reduction of energy sector charges. It
addresses only concessions granted before February 13, 1995;
therefore, it does not materially impact TBLE and ESBR;

= the Resolution CNPE-03 established changes in the methodology
of spot price calculation and on the sharing of the costs linked to
thermoelectric dispatch outside of the merit order, thereby
allocating a portion of these costs to generators and traders,
while previously these costs were born by end consumers only.
This new methodology, which has been deployed since
September 2013, is more conservative than the previous one
regarding the need for dispatching thermal power plants (with the
consequence of increasing the ‘spot’ price). During the transition
period from April to September 2013, the additional costs
associated with dispatching thermal power plant were applied to
all agents (including generators). The Association of Independent
Generators filed an injunction to cancel the obligation for its
members (independent generators) to support these additional
costs during the transition period;

m the approval of Resolution 1832 established a new cap
(BRL/MWh 388.48) and floor (BRL/MWh 30.26) for energy spot
price (PLD) in 2015. Until 2014, cap price adopted was
BRL/MWh 822.83.

After the below average hydrology of 2013, 2014 was again marked
by poor rainfalls during the wet season (December-April). This poor
hydrology resulted in reduction of water reservoir levels, especially in
the Southeast where most of the demand is located. Based on data
from the National System Operator (ONS), 2014 was the 9" driest
year in 83 years of measurement, with an energy inflow of 81.7% of
the long term average. Combined with the new methodology
introduced by CNPE-08, this situation led to an unprecedented
thermal dispatch to supply the increasing demand. This resulted in
very high spot prices along the year, reaching in some months the
level of the regulatory cap.

(2) GDF SUEZ will keep 60% stake of the free assured energy of Jirau HPP, while CHESF and Eletrosul will keep 20% stake each.

Peru

In Peru, GSELA owns 61.73% of EnerSur, which has an installed
capacity of 1,784 MW and a market share of around 16% in terms
of energy production. EnerSur shares are traded on the Lima stock
exchange.

Conversion of the 538 MW ChilcaUno thermoelectric power station
to a combined cycle plant with capacity of 805 MW was completed
in 2012 and the Cold Reserve thermoelectric plant located in llo
(south of Peru) of 564 MW was completed in 2013. Construction of
anew 110 MW HPP at Quitaracsa is underway. EnerSur also won a
bid in December 2013 to build and operate a 500 MW thermal plant
in llo (Nodo Energetico).

GSELA also has natural gas transmission activities in Peru, with an
8.1% stake in TGP (Transportadora de Gas del Pert), which
transports natural gas and associated liquids.

Regulations are based on unbundling of generation, transmission
and distribution activities. These activities have been partially
privatized. As a result, all new investments in generation are
undertaken by the private sector. Around a third of Peru's
generation is still controlled by state-owned company Electropert.

In July 2014, the tender regarding the construction and operation of
a new gas pipeline linking the area of domestic production
(Camisea) to the Southern part of Peru was awarded to the
consortium constituted by Odebrecht and Enagas. This will allow
GSELA to convert Nodo Energetico to gas.

Chile

E-CL is the leading company in electricity generation in Northern
Chile, with an installed capacity of 1,899 MW. GSELA owns 52.76%
of E-CL. E-CL’s subsidiary Electroandina operates a port in
Tocopilla and its gas transportation subsidiary Gasoducto
NorAndino owns a gas pipeline of approximately 1,000 km between
Chile and Argentina.

GSELA also holds a 63% stake in the Mejillones LNG regasification
terminal (GNLM). The commercial operation started in June 2010,
using first a 162,400 m° (gross capacity) floating storage unit. Since
March 2014, it is replaced by an onshore LNG storage tank, with a
net capacity of 175,000 m*.

Since April 2011, Solgas (previously Distrinor - 100% GSELA) has

been selling natural gas sourced through GNLM to industrial clients

and power plants located in the north of Chile.

In Chile’s Central Electricity Grid, through the wholly owned

company Edlica Monte Redondo, the Group’s two main assets are

the Monte Redondo 48 MW wind farm, and 34.4 MW Laja

hydropower plant currently under construction.

Important new laws have recently been approved:

= “20/25 Law”: to increase the participation of non-conventional
generating sources, up to 20% by 2025;

= “Concessions and Easements Law”: to solve issues related to the
negotiation of easements and concessions of transmission lines; and

m™ the “SIC-SING interconnection” law to enable the government to
auction infrastructure.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

In March 2014, the government of Mrs. Michelle Bachelet took
office for a 4-year term. The energy policy and main guidelines of
the new government were communicated through the “Energy
Agenda”. In this agenda, the government provides a lot of support
to the proposed interconnection between both electrical systems
SING and SIC, and to the use of natural gas, promoting the idea of
a third LNG terminal.

In September 2014, a tax reform was enacted in Chile, ruling a CO2
tax of 5 USD/ton to be paid by all the generators generation units
with a capacity greater than 50 MW. The CO, tax will start to be
charged in 2017, with first payment in the following year. However,
for E-CL the impact shall be limited, as most of its Power Purchase
Agreements allow for the pass-through of such cost to its industrial
clients.

In December 2014, E-CL was awarded, in a public tender among
generation companies, the contract to supply electricity to
distribution companies in the SIC: 2,016GWh in 2018 and
5,040 GWh per year between 2019-2032.

Such a successful outcome for E-CL will trigger different
investments of approximately US$1.8 billion over the following four
years, including a 600-km long transmission line project to connect
its power generation units in Mejillones (SING system) with the SIC
system. This line would become the interconnection between the
SIC and the SING systems (Central and Northern grids). The Chilean
government, who enacted a law early in 2014 to be able to auction
such interconnection, is currently analyzing the different alternatives.

Central America

In August, GDF SUEZ announced the sale of all its power
generation assets (600 MW) in Central America (i.e. Panama and
Costa Rica) to Celsia for a total enterprise value of US$840 million.
The handover between GDF SUEZ and Celsia took place in
December 2014.

Uruguay

GSELA made its entry into the Uruguayan market in October 2013
when the Company signed a 15-year Build, Own, Operate and
Transfer (BOOT) contract with Gas Sayago SA to provide LNG
storage and regasification services in the country. Located close to
Montevideo, the offshore terminal, GNL del Plata, will comprise a
Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) and a jetty,
protected by a 1.5km breakwater. The entire capacity of the
terminal, which will be capable of receiving LNG carriers up to
218,000 m®, will be reserved by the offtaker Gas Sayago. The
project is currently under construction.

The LNG terminal will have a long-term storage capacity of
263,000 m* and regasification capacity of 10Msm‘/day,
expandable to 15 Msm*/day. Tractebel Engineering acts as owner
engineer during the construction phase.

In March, GDF SUEZ concluded the sale of a 50% stake in GNL del
Plata to Marubeni. Following this transaction, Marubeni became a
50/50 partner in the project.

Argentina

In Argentina, GSELA holds a 64.2% interest in Litoral Gas SA, a gas
distribution company which has a market share of 12% in terms of
volume delivered in the region of Santa Fé and in the Northeast of
the province of Buenos Aires. In addition, it holds a 46.7% interest
in Energy Consulting Services (ECS), an electricity and gas sales
and consultancy company. GSELA also holds an interest in
Gasoducto Norandino, a gas transmission company with a pipeline
of approximately 1,000 km between Argentina and Chile, which is
100% owned by E-CL.

The government suspended the application of the pre-existing
regulatory framework through the declaration of a state of economic
emergency in 2002. This implied a tariff freeze and a reduction of
tariffs in dollar terms due to local currency devaluation. Since then,
very few tariff adjustments have been implemented in the energy
sector.

1.3.2.6.2 GDF SUEZ Energy North America

GDF SUEZ Energy North America (GSENA) manages the Group’s
electricity and gas activities in the United States, Canada, Puerto
Rico and Mexico. GSENA operations are organized into five
business segments: US power generation, US retail, US natural
gas/LNG, Mexico and Canada. A central portfolio management
group optimizes the interface between each business segment. The
business employs 2,300 people.

GSENA has an ownership interest in 13,056 MW of electric power
and cogeneration capacity. Of this capacity, close to 1,000 MW are
powered by renewable sources.

GSENA’s US natural gas/LNG business includes a LNG receiving
facility and a gas sales business in New England. In the US, the
company also markets power to commercial and_ industrial
customers in 11 States plus the District of Columbia, to small
commercial customers in 6 States, and to residential customers in
Pennsylvania. In Mexico, the company operates natural gas Local
Distribution Companies (LDCs), gas transmission pipelines and
power plants. The business in Canada is composed primarily of
utility-scale wind and solar facilities.

United States

North American operations are headquartered in Houston, Texas,
and the US business employs over 1,500 people. GSENA owns and
operates the Everett terminal just North of Boston, Massachusetts,
which has the capacity to deliver approximately 700 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day to the New England market. GSENA
leases over 10.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas storage. The
US activities have 11,479 MW of capacity in operation.

GSENA markets to large commercial and industrial customers
under the GDF SUEZ brand and to small commercial and residential
customers under the Think Energy retail brand. The retail business
serves approximately 60,000 customer meters with an estimated
peak load of nearly 10,000 MW.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

In 2014, GSENA achieved the following milestones:

m1) Think Energy entered the residential market in Pennsylvania;

m= 2) GSENA entered into a 1.0 Bcf of LNG purchase agreement
with Gaz Métro LNG to meet peak 2014-2015 winter demand in
New England.

GSENA’s business interests in the US are governed by Federal and

State regulations. Interstate wholesale electricity and natural gas

markets in the US are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory

Commission (FERC). Since 1992, the FERC has issued successive

regulatory orders to remove barriers to competition in wholesale

electricity markets. Over 60% of electricity consumed is delivered

through one of the ten Independent System Operators (ISOs) or

Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) that were created to

facilitate electricity competition.

The US Environmental Protection Agency proposed a greenhouse
gas emissions rule, requiring States to reduce emissions by as
much as 40% by 20380. A final revised rule is expected in 2015.

Retail electricity and natural gas sales to customers are regulated in
the US by each of the 50 States’ public utility commissions.

Puerto Rico

The activities in Puerto Rico include a 35% stake in the 507 MW
EcoEléctrica gas-fired plant and in the EcoEléctrica LNG terminal.

Mexico

In Mexico, GSENA operates six LDCs that serve more than
400,000 customers through a 6,500 km network and two gas
transmission companies operating over 900km of pipelines.
GSENA also manages three steam-electricity cogeneration plants
with a total installed capacity of 279 MW. Output from these power
plants is sold under long-term contracts to industrial clients.

In August, GDF SUEZ, together with its partner PEMEX, announced
the start of construction on the Ramones Phase I! South pipeline
(Ramones || South), a segment of the Ramones natural gas pipeline
system, which is one of the largest energy infrastructure projects in
Mexico's history, extending from the Texas border to central
Mexico.

Commissioning is underway on the 80 km Mayakan Extension gas
pipeline project, which is now fully physically interconnected with the
Mexican pipeline network. Full commercial operations are
anticipated to begin in Q1 2015.

Regulation of the electricity and natural gas markets is the remit of
the Comision Reguladora de Energia (Energy Regulatory
Commission), which is also charged with encouraging investment
and promoting competition in electricity and natural gas markets.
Sweeping Energy Reforms voted in 2013 are now being
implemented. GDF SUEZ and PEMEX signed a Memorandum of
Understanding and Cooperation in April 2014 to develop natural gas
and other energy projects in Mexico.

Canada

GSENA’s Canadian operations include utility-scale wind and solar
generation totaling 791 MW. The renewable portfolio operates
within a joint venture set up in 2012 between Mitsui & Co and a
consortium led by Fiera Axium Infrastructure Inc., each holding a
30% interest. GDF SUEZ, the largest shareholder with a 40%
interest, continues to operate and maintain these assets. The
company also owns and operates a 112 MW natural gas-fired
power plant in Ontario.

In Canada, energy policy is the jurisdiction of Provincial
Governments. Energy markets across Canada tend towards
vertically integrated utilities and/or various government owned
corporations (with the exception of Alberta). Government-run
procurements are a common contracting method and result in
long-term PPAs for generation facilities. Currently, Ontario is running
a procurement process for new large renewable facilities with results
expected late 2015.

1.3.2.6.3 GDF SUEZ Energy UK-Turkey

GDF SUEZ Energy UK-Turkey operates in the UK and Turkey. The
business has a diverse portfolio of 8,228 MW of operational
generation assets, including conventional coal, oil and gas-fired
plants, pumped storage and renewables. In addition, it owns a retail
business, gas distribution business and a trading function.

United Kingdom

GDF SUEZ Energy UK-Turkey is one of the major electricity
generators in the UK with a merchant generation fleet of operational
assets with a total capacity of 6,985 MW.

Together with Mitsui (25%), GDF SUEZ (75%) operates power
plants at Rugeley (coal), Saltend (gas), Deeside (gas), First Hydro
(pumped storage) and Indian Queens (light fuel oil) as well as the
trading business. In 2014, GDF SUEZ Energy UK-Turkey agreed to
sell its 10% stake in the Eggborough power station (coal). The
demolition of our 100%-owned Teesside (gas) plant, which was
decommissioned in 2013, is ongoing. GDF SUEZ Energy UK-Turkey
also holds 50% ownerships of seven wind farms (Barlockhart,
Blantyre, Carsington, Craigengelt, Crimp, Flimby, Sober) as well as a
small pipeline of wind projects at various stages of development.

The region has a trading business which trades UK power, UK gas,
EU carbon, and coal to manage the commodity price exposures
associated with its generation assets and retail market position.
GDF SUEZ Energy UK is the region’s retail business, based in
Leeds, with around 11,000 industrial and commercial sites taking
electricity and/or gas. In addition to supplying energy, GDF SUEZ
Energy UK offers demand-side services and is a growing provider of
export contracts and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). The
region also has a 30% ownership interest in OPUS, an electricity

and gas supplier to over 200,000 customers in the SME (small and
medium sized businesses) sector.

The UK energy market is a fully liberalized merchant market under
regulatory supervision from Ofgem. The UK Government's energy
policy is focused on encouraging low carbon generation, ensuring
security of supply, and consumer affordability. Fundamental to the
Government's aims is delivery of Electricity Market Reform (EMR)
which centres around two new instruments: Contract for Difference
Feed in Tariffs (CfD FiTs) to incentivize deployment of low carbon
technologies, and a Capacity Mechanism to ensure system security.
An Energy Bill providing the framework for these instruments
became an Act of Parliament in December 2013. The overall
process continued in 2014 with secondary legislation that
addresses the two instruments, followed by the award of the first
CfD Contracts, and the first capacity auction, in which GDF SUEZ
secured contracts for 3.2GW of capacity for the delivery
year 2018/19. The UK electricity market will gradually be
transformed over the coming years as low carbon technologies are
increasingly deployed under these incentives, coal generation is
closed and gas fired generation is increasingly used to provide
essential support to the system.

Turkey

With a total generating capacity of 1,243 MW, GDF SUEZ Energy
Uk-Turkey has a presence in two generation assets in Turkey
through its 95% stake in the 763 MW Baymina Enerji, a combined
cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station, and a 33.3% stake in
480 MW Uni-Mar Marmara, a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)
power plant. Power generated is sold to TETAS, the national
electricity offtaker, under long-term PPAs. The region also owns
90% of Turkey’s third largest natural gas distributor, IZGAZ, which
distrioutes and markets natural gas to residential, commercial and
industrial customers in the Kocaeli region. Furthermore, GDF SUEZ
Energy UK-Turkey has also been developing its power trading and
origination activities as well as its retail business in the country.

In cooperation with its Japanese partners Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries (MHI) and Itochu, GDF SUEZ has launched a feasibility
study for a nuclear power station to be built near the city of Sinop,
based on the ATMEA1 technology developed by MHI and Areva
(around 4.5 GW). The intergovernmental agreement between the
Turkish and Japanese governments and the agreement between
the project operators and the Turkish government have been
approved by the respective authorities and should be ratified by the
Turkish parliament in 2015.

Historically Turkey has been a PPA market with a single buyer.
However, the Turkish power market is currently going through a
process of liberalization with the aim of becoming a fully merchant
market. Merchant market trading has been gradually introduced
with daily settlements on the Balancing and Settlements Market
commencing at the end of 2010.

1.3.2.6.4 GDF SUEZ Energy South Asia, Middle East &
Africa (SAMEA)

Middle East

In the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, GDF SUEZ Energy
SAMEA acts as an asset developer, owner and operator, selling the
electricity and water it produces directly to government-owned
utilities under long-term P(W)PAs (Power (and Water) Purchase
Agreements). It is the leading private power and water developer in
the region with total generation capacity of 24,943 MW and 1,053.
MIGD (5.5 million m‘) water/day of desalination capacity in operation
and under construction. It is common in the Middle East IP(W)P
(Independent Power (and Water) Producer) business model for
projects to be part owned by the host governments/offtakers
alongside partners. The region conducts the operations of all of the
plants that it owns, often through an arms-length Operations &
Maintenance (O&M) contract.

The regulatory frameworks in the different countries of the GCC are

similar, with competitive tenders launched by the power authorities

calling for private power producers to bid for concessions to build,

own and operate plants. The output is then sold by the private

producer to a public utility under long-term contracts, the terms of

which are stipulated at the tender stage.

GDF SUEZ Energy SAMEA has ownership interests in the following

natural gas-fired power and water producing plants in the GCC:

= Saudia Arabia: Marafig, Riyadh PP11, Tihama;

= Bahrain: Al Dur, Al Ezzel, Al Hidd;

= Qatar: Ras Laffan B, Ras Laffan C;

m= UAE: Fujairah F2, Al Taweelah A1, Shuweihat S1, Shuweihat S2,
Umm Al Nar, Mirfa;

m= Oman: Al Kamil, Al Rusail, Barka 2, Barka 3, Sohar 1, Sohar 2;

m= Kuwait: Az Zour North.

The SAMEA region currently has circa 3,632 MW power capacity

and 107 MIGD (725,000 m*/day) water capacity under construction

in the GCC, in Saudi Arabia (extension of Tihama), Kuwait (Az Zour

North IWPP) and the UAE (Mirfa IWPP).

Sohar 2 and Barka3 IPPs in Oman launched their Initial Public

Offering in May 2014, culminating with their successful listing on the

Muscat Securities Market in June 2014. The founding shareholders

sold these shares to the public to comply with their respective

obligations in the Project Founders Agreements signed with

government owned Electricity Holding Company (EHC) in 2010.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

GDF SUEZ is the largest shareholder in both companies with circa
30% of the share capital of both companies after the IPOs.

GDF SUEZ holds a 20% equity interest in the Mirfa project with the
remaining 80% held by Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority
(ADWEA). Mirfa IWPP will have a total power capacity of 1,600 MW
and a seawater desalination capacity of 52.5MIGD
(238,665 m*/day). Commercial operation of the project is expected
to start on a phased basis between 2016 and 2017. A fully-owned
subsidiary of GDF SUEZ will be responsible for the Operations &
Maintenance of the power plant.

South Asia

In Pakistan, in the south-western province of Baluchistan,
GDF SUEZ Energy SAMEA holds 100% in Uch |, a 551 MW
gas-fired facility. The 381 MW = gas-fired unit UchIl (100%
ownership), an extension to Uch |, started commercial operation in
April 2014. The electricity generated from Uch II is sold through a
25-year Power Purchase Agreement with the National Transmission
and Despatch Company, a state-owned utility.

All power generated by IPPs in Pakistan is sold under long-term
PPAs to distribution companies. The end consumer market is not
liberalized. Around 50% of generation capacity is held by private
IPPs, while the remainder is held by state-owned entities.

In India, GDF SUEZ has a 86.61% equity share in the Meenakshi
thermal project in Andhra Pradesh, which comprises 269 MW of
operational capacity and 638 MW under construction. In May 2014,
GDF SUEZ inaugurated its new office in New Delhi, from which it will
continue to develop further opportunities for GDF SUEZ Energy
International.

The power sector in India is liberalized, with various offtake
arrangements (long-term PPAs, short-term bilateral contracts and
spot trading) all possible.

Africa

The region started construction of three independent power
projects in 2013 with a total production capacity of 1.4 GW: in
Morocco, the 301 MW Tarfaya wind farm, in South Africa, the
1,012 MW open-cycle turbine power plants (peakers) and the
94 MW West Coast 1 wind farm. Tarfaya reached full commercial
operation in December 2014.

The Safi 2x693 MW project in Morocco started construction in
October 2014 after achieving financial close, bringing GDF SUEZ’s
total construction portfolio on the African continent to 2,492 MW.
Following completion of the plant, expected in 2018, the electricity
produced will be sold to the Office National de |’Electricité et de
|’Eau Potable (ONEE) under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement.

GDF SUEZ also concluded a project development agreement with
Exxaro for a 600 MW coal-fired power plant in Limpopo province.

In terms of regulation, a single buyer model, whereby output is sold
by the private producer to a public utility under long-term contracts,
has been adopted in Morocco and South Africa.

1.3.2.6.5 GDF SUEZ Energy Asia-Pacific

GDF SUEZ Energy Asia-Pacific has strongholds in Australia,
Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. Its businesses in Asia-Pacific
include the construction and operation of power plants, natural gas
distribution systems and retail activities.

Australia

The Australian business is focused on a diverse portfolio of
generation assets operating in the National Electricity Market (NEM)
that serves 90% of the Australian population and demand, resident
in the eastern states. The portfolio also includes a co-generation
asset in the separate South Western Integrated System (SWIS)
market that serves Western Australia. It also has a retail business
called “Simply Energy” in the NEM, serving electricity and gas
accounts in the domestic, small to medium enterprise and large
commercial and industrial customer segments.

GDF SUEZ Australian Energy is an important participant in the NEM.
It predominantly produces wholesale electricity and is focused on
delivery of value through optimal participation of its assets in the
relevant Australian electricity, gas and renewable energy markets,
exploration of potential synergies with other GDF SUEZ businesses
in Australia, and opportunistic growth of its generation and retail
portfolios, including renewables. In 2013, Mitsui acquired from
GDF SUEZ Australian Energy a 28% stake in all its assets (except
Loy Yang B and Kwinana - where Mitsui already owned 30%). The
portfolio of GDF SUEZ Australian Energy:

™ generating assets in South Australia: 921 MW;

™ generating assets in Victoria: 2,507 MW;

™ generating assets in Western Australia: 123 MW;

= retail customers Simply Energy: over 500,000.

Australian energy markets have been progressively liberalized since
the mid-1990s, when the first wholesale electricity market was.
introduced in Victoria. The level of private and state-owned energy
infrastructure varies between states. Under the Competition
Principles Agreement, between state and federal governments,
publicly owned businesses in competitive markets are treated in a
manner intended to ensure competitive neutrality between public
and private energy businesses. New South Wales has started to
privatize its generation assets.

The NEM is a deregulated merchant wholesale market serving the
interconnected eastern states of Australia, in operation since 1998.
It is a near real-time, energy-only, gross pool, spot market with no
capacity payments. Up to 48 GW of installed generation capacity is
dispatched on a five-minute basis over five states.

Gas markets exist in each of the eastern states except Tasmania,
and are less developed than the electricity market.

population (estimated at just over 2 million). The SWIS has a
summer peak demand of approximately 4,000 MW. The WEM
market structure is a net bilateral structure and has separate
capacity and energy mechanisms.

The (former) Australian Government's “Clean Energy Future”
greenhouse gas emissions reduction scheme commenced _ in
July 2012, committing it to a medium-term national target of reducing
emissions significantly. In September 2013, a new government was
elected and has repealed Carbon Legislation in July 2014.

Indonesia

GDF SUEZ Energy Asia-Pacific holds a 40.5% stake in Paiton 3 & 7/8,
with a total of 2,035 MW coal-fired capacity, located on the island of
Java. A PPA is in place for both Paiton 7/8 and Paiton 3 up to 2042.

In cooperation with PT Supreme Energy, the business is also
developing three geothermal projects in Sumatra (Muara Laboh,
Rantau Dedap and Rajabasa).

State owned incumbent PLN has the monopoly on transmission
and distribution systems. Since the mid-1990s IPPs have been
allowed to operate in Indonesia and they now operate 16% of the
existing generating capacity. The end-user market is not liberalized.

In December 2009, the “Crash 2 program” for 10,000 MW of new
generation capacity was launched. This program stipulated that
50% of this new capacity is to come from IPPs and 50% from PLN,
and that 5,340 MW of the new capacity will come from renewable
resources. In 2014, the new Jokowi administration has set a target
to develop 35,000 MW of new generating capacity by 2019 out of
which 15,000 MW will be developed by PLN and 20,000 MW will be
built by IPPs.

Thailand & Laos

The Glow Group, in which GDF SUEZ Energy Asia-Pacific holds a
majority interest (69.1%), is listed on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand. It is a major participant in the Thai energy market with a
combined installed capacity in Thailand and Laos of 3,195 MW. The
Glow Group generates and supplies electricity to the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) under Thailand’s SPP
(Small Power Producer) and IPP (Independent Power Producer)
programs, in addition to supplying electricity, steam, industrial water
and services to large industrial customers principally located in the
Map Ta Phut industrial Estate, Rayong Province.

GDF SUEZ Energy Asia-Pacific also owns a 40% stake in PTT NGD, a
distributor of natural gas to industrial customers in the Bangkok region.

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

State-owned EGAT is the main entity in the electricity sector. Until
liberalization of the sector, EGAT generated around 95% of
Thailand's power. It now accounts for about 50% of generation
capacity while the rest is accounted for by the non-government
sector comprising IPPs, SPPs and imports from Laos and Malaysia.
IPPs in Thailand sell the energy that they produce to EGAT under
long-term contracts, the terms of which are stipulated at the IPP
tender stage. In industrial parks private generation companies can
sell electricity to local customers.

Singapore
GDF SUEZ Energy Asia-Pacific holds a 30% stake in Senoko
Energy, one of the three largest power generators in Singapore, with

an approximate 25% market share. Senoko Energy owns and
operates a unique portfolio of power generation assets with a
combined capacity of 3,201 MW.

In 2001, the electricity generation and retail markets were separated
from the natural monopoly existing in the electricity transmission
market. The National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) was
established in 2003: generation companies compete to sell
electricity every 30 minutes, while electricity retailers buy electricity
from the NEMS and offer packages to sell electricity to eligible
consumers. In 2004, in order to promote efficiency and competition
in the electricity market, vesting contracts were introduced whereby
generation companies are committed to sell a specified amount of
electricity at a specified price.

As of December 31, 2014, GDF SUEZ’s 2P reserves of liquid
hydrocarbons and natural gas (“entitlement”) were 758.8 Mboe,
compared with 799 Mboe in 2013. Gas accounts for 75% of these
reserves, which represent a volume of 572 Mboe, or 91 billion cubic
meters.

For those fields that are operated under a production-sharing
contract, the “tax barrels” reserves have been recognized in
accordance with the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) rules for
recognizing 2P reserves. These “tax barrels” reserves correspond to
the taxes paid on behalf of GDF SUEZ E&P by its partners, the
national oil companies, to the authorities of the respective countries.

The Group’s share in 2P reserves for the fields in which it is a
partner (working interest reserves") was 922 Mboe at the end of
2014 compared to 962 Mboe at the end of 2013.

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

Each year, a proportion of approximately one-third of the reserves is
evaluated independently by a specialist consulting firm (DeGolyer
and MacNaughton this year).

To estimate its 2P reserves, the Group uses the “SPE PRMS”
classification, based on the common definitions of the SPE and the
World Petroleum Congress (WPC).

The 2P reserves replacement ratio for a given period is defined as
the ratio of additions of 2P reserves for the period (discoveries, net
acquisitions and revisions of reserves) to production for the period.
The 2P reserves replacement ratio for GDF SUEZ E&P was 144%
over the 2010-2012 period, 90% over the 2011-2013 period, and
82% over the 2012-2014 period.

Production

During the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2014, the gas and
liquid hydrocarbons production sold by GDF SUEZ E&P was
55.5 Mboe.

Description of the LNG activities in the Group

GDF SUEZ’s recognized expertise over the entire LNG value chain,
from production to imports and marketing, including LNG terminal
operation and maritime shipping, enables it to take advantage of the
strong growth of the LNG market.

LNG gives the Group access to new natural gas resources and
helps it diversify and secure its supply. It also enables the Group to
develop new markets and to rationalize management of its gas
supply portfolio. The LNG business is being developed in
coordination with the Group’s upstream (exploration & production)
and downstream activities (natural gas supply and power
production).

LNG supply and positions in liquefaction

GDF SUEZ buys LNG under long-term (15-20 years) and
medium-term (1-5 years) supply contracts. The Group also
purchases spot LNG cargoes. The Group’s contractual annual
long-term commitments are as follows (as of December 31, 2014):

projects:

== a liquefaction plant in the United States: in May 2013, GDF SUEZ
signed an agreement to create a joint venture with Sempra
Energy, Mitsubishi and Mitsui to develop, finance and build the
natural gas liquefaction plant of Cameron LNG at the Cameron
LNG terminal in Louisiana. This agreement will give GDF SUEZ
access to an annual liquefaction capacity of 4 million metric tons
from 2018. The foundation stone for the project was laid in
October 2014;

a liquefaction plant in Cameroon: the project, in cooperation with
Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures, comprises construction of
a liquefaction plant with a maximum annual capacity of 3.5 million
metric tons, located near Kribi and supplied by a national
transmission network connecting it with Cameroon's offshore
natural gas fields;

the Group announced in June 2014 that the Bonaparte LNG
project in Australia (60% owned by GDF SUEZ and 40% by
Santos) would not proceed to the advanced engineering phase
this year as previously planned. A study of alternatives to floating
liquefaction for the recovery of reserves was undertaken in order
to maximize the value of these reserves.

LNG destination and positions in regasification
terminals

In 2014, LNG deliveries were made mainly in Europe and Asia, as
well as in North and South America.

The Group has access to regasification capacity in six countries:
France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States, Chile and
Puerto Rico.

In India in April 2012, GDF SUEZ was selected as a strategic partner
of the Andhra Pradesh Gas Distribution Corporation (APGDC) for
the development of a floating import LNG terminal. With a capacity
of 3.5 Mtpa, the terminal will be located on the east coast of India.
GDF SUEZ would have a stake in the terminal with access to
regasification capacity. Shell joined this project in July 2014.

chartering terms vary from a few days to 20 years or more. At the
end of 2014, the GDF SUEZ fleet included 14 LNG carriers:

m 3 ships owned by the Group: Matthew (126,540 m‘), Provalys
(154,500 m®), GDF SUEZ Global Energy (74,130 m9;

=m 2 ships of which the Group is a co-owner: Gaselys (154,500 m*,
owned by the NYK Group and GDF SUEZ) and BW GDF SUEZ
Boston (owned by the BW Gas Group and GDF SUEZ); and

= 9 other ships chartered from other shipping companies.

In maritime transport, GDF SUEZ also has an 80% stake in shipping

management company GAZOCEAN (the other 20% stake is held by

Japanese shipping company NYkK), and a 40% stake in

Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT).

1.3.3.6.3 GTT (Gaztransport & Technigaz)

Role
GTT is the world leader in the design of cryogenic membrane
containment systems used in the shipping industry for LNG

transportation. GTT has more than 50 years of experience in its
field.

GTT operates in five sectors: LNG carriers, FLNG (floating
production, storage and unloading units for LNG), FSRU (floating
storage and regasification units for LNG), land storage tanks and
solutions for LNG use as fuel.

GTT aims to:
= provide the LNG industry with containment systems designed by

the company that enable the safe and reliable bulk transportation
and storage of LNG;

m provide engineering, consultancy, training, © maintenance
assistance and execution of technical studies at every stage of
the LNG chain; and

= adapt its technologies to promote new outlets for LNG, including
by helping to develop LNG as a fuel for ships, and the
transportation of LNG by sea or river in small or mid-sized
vessels.

Principal key indicators

As at December 31, 2014:

m= the order backlog contains more than 100 orders (LNG tankers,
ethane tankers, FLNG"’, FSRU®, land storage tanks);

(1) Floating LNG production, storage and unloading units.

(2) Floating LNG storage and regasification units.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

= GIT is the leader in its sector, representing more than 80% of
global orders for LNG tankers, and the only three FLNG orders
over 50,000 m®, between 2008 and December 30, 2014;

= GIT employs more than 380 staff, two-thirds of whom are
engineers.

Activities

GTT has developed tried and tested technologies over the past
50 years. It is the only company that markets “membrane”
containment technologies for ships with general approval for
application on vessels. Applied to LNG tankers, these technologies
allow for LNG to be transported in bulk in the ship, as the hull is
protected by thermal insulation that maintains the LNG at cryogenic
temperature (-162°Celsius at atmospheric pressure). As the LNG is
contained by a thin metal lining, this double membrane complies
with regulatory requirements.

GTT’s two main technologies whose implementation is
comprehensively controlled, Mark Ill and NO 96, are well-known for
their excellence and reliability. They are protected by patents. These
technologies, and developments in them, are mainly used on
tankers for LNG transportation. Meanwhile, thanks to long-term
investments in research and development relating to its traditional
technologies, GTT has developed new applications, particularly for
floating units (FSRU and FLNG), and land storage tanks.

GTT’s customers can access its technologies by implementing
licensing agreements that provide them with protected rights to the
technologies as well as the know-how of GTT, which supports its
customers throughout their construction projects.

GTT also provides its customers with engineering services
irrespective of whether they enter into a licensing agreement.

Lastly, GTT provides ad hoc services that include training,
maintenance assistance, certification assistance and execution of
technical studies.

GTT’s technologies have long been accepted and endorsed by the
classification companies in the maritime domain.

The company, which has been 1SO-9001-certified since
December 2010, is now focused on fine-tuning its quality
management system so that it can continue consistently meet the
quality standards required by its customers supporting growth.

Nearly all of the Company's customers are in Asia (mainly China and
South Korea).

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP
1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

1342 Strategy

The Infrastructures business line and its subsidiaries aim to promote
the development of their long-term activities by strengthening the
position of natural gas in the French energy mix, and by seeking
new sources of growth in France and internationally.

Their strategic reflections also aim to adapt the offer from
subsidiaries in the short-term, given the situation marked by
restrictions, uncertainty and opportunities.

Finally, they seek to combine day-to-day professional excellence
(safety of property and persons and continuity of customer supply)
and economic efficiency.

1343 Organization

The organization of activities within the Infrastructures business line
is based on four independent subsidiaries which are all incorporated
as French sociétés anonymes. In France, each of them operates,
markets and develops facilities directly under their own
responsibility: Storengy for its storage sites, Elengy for its LNG
terminals at Montoir-de-Bretagne and Fos Tonkin, GrDF for its
distribution network, and GRTgaz for its transmission network
(pipelines and in-line compression stations).

In addition, three of them carry the Group’s investment stakes in
Europe:

= GDF SUEZ storage subsidiaries in Germany and the UK are
attached to Storengy;
m= Megal and GRTgaz Deutschland in Germany are attached to
GRTgaz;
m Elengy, the majority shareholder of Société du Terminal Méthanier
de Fos Cavaou (Fosmax LNG), operates the terminal.
In accordance with the Energy Code, GRTgaz owns the assets
necessary to accomplish its missions. The commercial and financial
agreements and service provision contracts between GRTgaz and
GDF SUEZ or its subsidiaries are strictly regulated (cf. Articles
L. 111-17 and L. 111-18 of the Energy Code). Some are subject to
prior authorization from the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE).
In particular, provision of services by the “vertically integrated
undertaking” to GRTgaz (cf. article L. 111-10 of the Energy Code)
must be strictly necessary to GRTgaz’s activity for the purpose of
ensuring the gas system’s balance, security and safety.

13.4.6 Description of activities

A specific legislative and regulatory environment

GDF SUEZ remains a vertically integrated group but its organization
concerning gas infrastructure management activities has been
strongly impacted by the implementation of successive European
Directives regarding the organization of the domestic energy market

(1) Independent Transmission Operator.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

and the laws transposing them. The infrastructure activities have all
been affiliated.

In 2011, in its transposition of the “internal market” Directive
2009/73/EC, known as the “Thrid Gas Directive”, France opted for
the ITO system" management of the transmission network
(GRTgaz). This system sets out the autonomy and independence
rules with which GRTgaz must comply in respect of GDF SUEZ
while recognizing the entitlement of GDF SUEZ to perform
economic and management supervision. In 2012, the CRE certified
the compliance of GRTgaz with these provisions. In 2013, after a
thorough analysis of the law in France (especially the Energy Code)
transposing the Thrid Gas Directive, the European Commission
made some comments on its compliance with the Directive. These
comments are currently under review by the French authorities.

The legal framework within which the activities of the Infrastructures
business line is carried out includes the General Local Authorities
Code which specifies the scheme applying specifically to
concession-based distribution networks, the Energy Code which
reviewed and updated a substantial part of the other legislative
provisions relating to natural gas, and the Environment Code which
specifically determines the rules on the construction and operation
of transmission infrastructures.

The Energy Code imposes public service obligations on GDF SUEZ
and its subsidiaries, especially natural gas infrastructure managers.
It provides for the French State to sign public service contracts with
GDF SUEZ, GRTgaz and GrDF to ensure the implementation of
public service delegations, especially those managed by its
infrastructure subsidiaries. Discussions between the public
authorities, GDF SUEZ, GrDF and GRTgaz are currently being
finalized. The French State publishes an indicative multiyear plan
describing foreseeable changes in demand for natural gas, how this.
demand is met and investments scheduled to this end.

The CRE ensures the proper functioning of the market to the benefit
of consumers and ensures compliance by infrastructure managers.
with their obligations: access to infrastructures, non-discrimination,
respect for the confidential nature of commercially sensitive
information (CSI). Managers of the transmission and distribution
networks must draft a Code of Conduct approved by the CRE. An
independent compliance manager, reporting to the CRE, monitors
its implementation.

The CRE sets the regulatory framework (rate of return for assets,
tariff indexation mechanism, measures to encourage certain types.

of investment, etc.) and the corresponding infrastructure access
tariffs.

1.3.4.6.1 Underground natural gas storage

The GDF SUEZ Group is the leader in underground storage in
Europe, with a storage capacity of around 13 Gm’.

www.gdfsuez.com


--- Page 36 ---

France
As of December 31, 2014, Storengy was operating in France:

m= 14 underground storage facilities (including 13 wholly-owned).
Nine of these storage facilities are in aquifers (total useful storage
volume 9 billion m’), four are in salt caverns (total useful storage
volume 1 billion m‘), and one is in a depleted field (useful storage
volume 80 million m*); three of these sites have been mothballed
(corresponding to a total useful volume of 800 million m*) and the
development of a fourth site has been suspended;

= 51 compressors with a total power of 219 MW, needed to
withdraw and inject natural gas;

= surface facilities required to process the gas withdrawn, before
injection into the transmission network.

Legislative and regulatory environment in France

Underground storage facilities fall under the Mining Code and are
operated pursuant to a concession granted by the French State
following a public inquiry and competitive tenders. GDF SUEZ holds
mining rights that it farms out") to its subsidiary, Storengy, which
operates them and thus holds the corresponding authorizations.

According to the Third Gas Directive, access to storage is organized
according to a system known as “negotiated access”. Storage
prices are set by Storengy, in a transparent, non-discriminatory
manner. The Energy Code and the decree of August 21, 2006 set
the access conditions for storage facilities. This decree specifically
sets out the conditions for granting and assigning storage capacity
access rights and their distribution, and requires the authorized
supplier or agent to maintain sufficient stores in order that, on
October 31 of every year, they have enough natural gas to supply
their customers from November 1 to March 31. An annual decree
sets out the storage rights in question and related obligations. This
decree was revised on March 12, 2014 because the existing
regulatory framework was no longer adequate, due to changes in
the operation of the gas market, to ensure that suppliers have
sufficient storage capacity to ensure continuity of supply during
periods of extreme cold.

Pricing conditions vary according to the technical capacity of the
reservoirs, the basic storage service and the type of additional
operating services selected.

Germany

Storengy Deutschland GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Storengy, is one of the leaders on the German underground gas
storage market, with over 8% market share by volume. The
company owns and operates six storage sites for a working

1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

capacity of nearly 1.7 billion mS (three salt sites: Harsefeld, Lesum
and Peckensen; and three depleted sites: | Fronhofen,
Schmidhausen and Uelsen®. It also holds a 19.7% stake in the
Breitbrunn depleted site (992 million m* in total).

United Kingdom

Storengy UKLtd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Storengy, is
dedicated to the construction and marketing of storage capacities
in saline cavities at Stublach, in Cheshire. The planned storage
capacity at the site is 400 million m® of useful volume, divided into
20 cavities. The UK’s Office of the Gas and Electricity Market
(OFGEM) granted it a third-party access exemption for the entire
project.

Storage strategy

Storengy must adapt to market conditions brought about by gas

overcapacity currently noted in Europe:

m= optimizing and enhancing its business in its traditional markets;

m™ identifying new sources of growth in emerging markets, using its
expertise, particularly in terms of geosciences and the
management of health and safety risks;

= investing in new markets like geothermal, since Storengy has
specific expertise in underground and drilling.

In the longer term, it intends to diversify its business by operating in

niche markets (storage in lined mined caverns coated to make them

pressure tight) and by contributing to the implementation of new

energy transition solutions (compressed air storage, hydrogen,

synthetic methane and biomethane).

1.3.4.6.2 LNG terminal activities

LNG terminals are port facilities that allow liquid natural gas (LNG) to
be received and regasified. New services have been added since
2012: reloading and transshipment of LNG tankers and LNG truck
loading (road transported LNG).

Elengy is the second-largest European LNG terminal operator
(source: GIIGNL), with three LNG terminals in France. The facilities
operated by Elengy have a total regasification capacity” of
21.25 billion m® (Gm‘) of gas per annum to December 31, 2014.

Fos Tonkin Terminal

Brought into service in 1972, Fos Tonkin is located on the
Mediterranean coast and receives LNG primarily from Algeria. Its
regasification capacity stands at 3 billion m® per year. Its jetty can
accommodate ships carrying up to 75,000 m® of LNG and its three
tanks have a total capacity of 150,000 m’.

1.3 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS LINES

Montoir-de-Bretagne terminal

Montoir-de-Bretagne, which was brought into service in 1980, is
located on the Atlantic coast and receives LNG from various
sources. It has a regasification capacity of 10 billion m® per year,
two jetties that can accommodate ships transporting up to around
260,000 m® of LNG (Q-MAX) and three tanks with a total capacity of
360,000 m®. Renovation of the terminal was completed in 2013,
allowing it to be operated at its current capacity until 2035.

Fos Cavaou Terminal

The Fos Cavaou terminal was brought into commercial service in
2010. It has a regasification capacity of 8.25 Gm* per year, a jetty
that can accommodate Q-MAX-size tankers, and three tanks with a
total capacity of 330,000 m*. The terminal is owned by a dedicated
subsidiary, FosmaxLNG, in which Elengy has a 72.5% stake, while
Total Gaz Electricité Holding France SAS holds a 27.5% stake. It is
operated by Elengy.

Legal and regulatory environment specific to
regasification activities in France

An LNG terminal is a facility subject to classification for
environmental protection purposes (Seveso facilities) and, therefore,
its operation is subject to a specific authorization by the prefecture.
These authorizations (Montoir-de-Bretagne and Fos Tonkin) were
transferred to Elengy by Prefectural Decree in 2008. The Prefectural
Decree authorizing the full operation of the Fos Cavaou LNG
terminal was signed on February 14, 2012.

Access to LNG terminals: principles and tariffs

Regulated tariffs for access to LNG terminals applicable since
April 1, 2013 were adopted following the CRE ruling of
December 13, 2012 and adjusted mid-period by the CRE ruling of
December 17, 2014. They are scheduled to apply until March 31,
2017.

The tariff package consists of five terms depending (i) on the
number of unload operations, (ii) quantities unloaded, (iii) use of
regasification capacity, (iv) gas-in-kind and (v) seasonal adjustment.
The mid-period adjustment led to a 4.2% cut in the average unit
tariff at Montoir, a 3.8% cut at Cavaou and a 25.1% increase at
Tonkin. The RAB for Elengy and FosMax combined stood at
€1,168 million at January 1, 2015 with an actual rate of return of
8.5%, before corporate income tax.

The LNG terminal activities strategy

Elengy’s strategy is centered on the following key points:

= to optimize operation methods for each of the three sites in order
to get best value from them regardless of their utilization rate;

m to create and implement new services at the terminals, similarly to
what is being done in terms of reloading, transshipment between
LNG tankers and the loading of tanker trucks;

m to search for growth opportunities internationally by highlighting
the skills of asset manager and operator developed over the past
50 years.

1.3.4.6.3 Distribution activities in France

The main activity of the distribution business in France is to deliver
the gas sold by the suppliers to the end customers. It operates
within the general framework set out in Section 1.3.4.1 but has
specific features related to its nature as a local utility.

Legislative and regulatory environment specific to
these activities

The Concession system

Each municipality where a gas supply is available grants a
concession to an authorized distributor to operate the public service
of gas distribution on its territory. Concessions are entered into or
renewed based on standard specifications established jointly by the
French national federation of concession-granting and
state-controlled municipalities (FNCCR) and GrDF.
Concession-granting bodies exercise control to ensure the proper
execution of the obligations resulting from these specifications.

Distribution structures belong to the municipalities even when they
are built and financed by the distributor, who has an exclusive right
to use them.

The Energy Code recognizes the entitlement of exclusive
concession rights to historic concession-holders, i.e. GrDF and 22
local distribution companies (ELD), to exclusive service areas. As
holders of a “distribution monopoly”, they are the sole operators
with whom municipalities may renew the concession. The grounds.
for terminating a concession contract early are strictly controlled
(listed limitatively) as is the date the concession can be terminated
(cannot be in the first half of the contracted term). Termination also
requires two years’ notice and the concession-granting authority
must pay compensation to the concessionaire for early termination.

Apart from the exclusive service areas of GrDF and the local
distribution companies, the Energy Code allows all municipalities not
supplied with natural gas to entrust their public gas distribution to
the operator of their choice.

The joint department specific to GrDF and ERDF

The Energy Code assigns a joint department, primarily responsible
for construction, worksite project management, network operations.
and maintenance, and metering operations.

GrDF and ERDF are linked by an agreement defining their
relationship within the Joint Department, the services it provides,
and the distribution of the resulting costs. This agreement, signed
for an indefinite period, may be terminated at any time, subject to
18 months’ notice, during which period the parties undertake to
renegotiate an agreement.

GrDF activities

As of December 31, 2014, the French natural gas distribution
network operated by GrDF was the leading network of this type in
Europe due to its length (196,940 km)". It has some 10.9 million
delivery points” in 9,529 municipalities served (of which 8,955
based on exclusive rights assigned to GrDF), representing
approximately 77% of the French population.

With 260 TWh of natural gas delivered in 2014, GrDF represented
95% of the French market for network gas distribution.

(2) As of December 31, 2014, 2,001,968 customers supplied in this way used an altermative gas supplier.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

www.gdfsuez.com


--- Page 38 ---

The average residual term of its concession contracts, weighted by
volumes distributed, was 13.25 years at December 31, 2014.

Access to the gas distribution network: principles and
tariffs

The new GrDF gas distribution tariff (the “ATRD 4”) came into force
on July 1, 2012") for a period of four years. It applies to the GrDF
exclusive service area. The structure of this tariff is consistent with
the previous tariff (compensation on asset base and consideration
of operating expenses). A Charges and Revenue Regularization
Account (CRRA) offsets the difference between projected and actual
income and expenses, specifically for the income relating to the
volume of gas transported.

The regulated asset base (RAB) includes all distribution activity
assets such as pipelines and connections, pressure regulation
stations, meters and other technical and [T-related equipment,
depreciated on a straight-line method to determine the annual
capital expenses. Pipelines and connections, which represent 92%
of the assets in the RAB are depreciated over 45 years. The RAB
stood at €14,314 million, subject to CRE validation, at January 1,
2014 with an actual rate of return of 6%, before corporate income
tax.

The tariff structure will change on July 1 each year according to a
percentage variation equal to “inflation +0.2%” (excluding the effect
of the CRRA), based on productivity of 1.3% per annum on net
operating expenses. On July 1, 2014, the tariff increased by 2.94%,
including the effect of the CRRA. In addition, periodic updates to the
catalogue and the price of services (suppliers, customers and
biomethane producers) are now subject to rulings by the CRE.

Lastly, a specific regulatory framework for the Gazpar smart meters.
project was defined in the CRE ruling of July 17, 2014. It is based
on the allocation of a remuneration premium of 200 basis points on
the metering assets brought into service during the industrial
deployment phase (2017-2022), accompanied by a capped global
mechanism to encourage compliance with all the project's aspects,
Le.

m= biennial monitoring of compliance with the provisional timetable
for the project’s deployment, with penalties for delays;

™ annual monitoring of the unit cost of the meters;

™ annual monitoring of the system’s performance;

™ annual monitoring of the investment expenditure on the IS and
smart meter chain.

GrDF strategy

The GrDF strategy is centered on the following key points:

m to develop the historical gas business, with an emphasis on the
promotion of gas in its various markets. In particular, GrDF wants
to invest in research and development and industrial partnerships

to support innovative residential solutions, such as renewable
energy/gas and hybrids (gas/electricity). It will also support
implementation of the new “Thermal Regulations” for new
residential buildings;

m™ to create or support innovation, as was the case with biomethane
injection and smart meters, to improve the image of gas and
open the business to new activities;

= to expand internationally, which may initially take the form of
service delivery;

™ to strengthen its image and revenues, in connection with the
development of incentive-based regulation by reinforcing
industrial safety and implementing a performance plan.

1.3.4.6.4 Transmission activities

Around 75% of GRTgaz is owned by GDF SUEZ, with 25% owned by
Société d’Infrastructures Gaziéres (SIG), a consortium bringing together
CNP Assurances, CDC Infrastructures and Caisse des Dépéts.

GRTgaz develops, operates and maintains a transmission network,
manages the natural gas flows that flow through it, and markets
network access services to gas suppliers. It also manages an
interest in the Megal Germany transmission network.

The facilities

GRTgaz wholly owns one of the longest high-pressure natural gas
transmission networks in Europe”, representing 32,153 km, in
France, at December 31, 2014: the main network (8,110 km) sends
natural gas from entry points (LNG terminals, interconnection points
with international pipeline networks) to the regional network. The
regional network (24,042 km) then directs it towards some 4,500
delivery points serving industrial customers and_ distribution
networks. GRTgaz operates 26 compression stations.

During 2014, GRTgaz sent 51 billion m® of gas across the French
network (583 TWh).

In addition, GRTgaz has investments in the Megal transmission
network in Germany (1,167 km), representing a cumulative length”
of 429 km.

Legal and regulatory framework for gas transmission in
France

This activity takes place within a general framework (defined in
section 1.3.4.5.) aimed at ensuring the independence of the
network manager.

The Energy Code states that the construction and operation of natural
gas transmission pipelines must be authorized by a competent
administrative body, the conditions for which are set by Articles
L. 555-7 et seq. and Articles R. 555-2 et seq. of the Environment
Code. Authorizations are registered and non-transferable. Entities that
obtain natural gas transmission authorizations must comply with the
terms and conditions of the authorizations.

(3) Cumulative length of the network: length in kilometers of the pipes for the network in question multiplied by the percentage stake held by GDF SUEZ.

Access to the gas transmission network: principles and
tariffs

Pursuant to its ruling on the pricing decision of December 13, 2012
the CRE defined the methodology and set the tariffs known as
“ATRT 5” destined to apply from April 1, 2013 for a period of
four years. The tariff structure is updated on April 1 each year. Each
year, it is drawn up to cover the income authorized by the CRE,
according to observed inflation data and the best available forecasts
of capacity subscriptions for the year in question.

The blueprint for net operating expenses includes a productivity
objective. An incentive for cost control in investment programs is
introduced, along with a revision clause after two years enabling
adjustment of the blueprint for net operating expenses for 2015 and
2016, under certain conditions.

At April 1, 2014, the transmission tariff saw an average increase of
3.9%. The rate of return applied to the regulated asset base (RAB) is
6.5% (real, pre-tax). An increase of 3% is retained for investments
already made, creating additional capacity on the main network. In
terms of new investment, the allocation of this increase is restricted
to the Val de Sadne projects and decentralized odorization of
natural gas.

The CRE ruling on December 17, 2014 led to an average increase
of 2.5% in the GRTgaz tariff at April 1, 2015.

The RAB 2014 for the transmission network stands at
€7,309 million (subject to validation by the CRE).

Transmission Europe

Megal GmbH & Co.KG (“Megal”), owned 49%" by GRTgaz
Deutschland (a wholly-owned subsidiary of GRTgaz), and 51% by
Open Grid Europe, has a pipeline network connecting the Czech
and Austrian borders with the French border. Megal has granted
rights to use its assets to GRTgaz Deutschland and to Open Grid
Europe, which separately manage the transmission service
purchased by the shippers on their part of the network. GRTgaz
Deutschland GmbH markets approximately 58% of the capacity of
the Megal network.

Transmission business strategy

The GRTgaz strategy aims to ensure its development in the long
term both in France and internationally by:

= contributing to better integration of the European markets by
making the necessary investments, such as the gas pipelines
“Hauts de France 2” (now in service) and “Arc de Dierrey” (under
construction), and by proposing innovative services with
neighboring operators (Storengy, Elengy) as GRTgaz has done
with JTS (Voint Transport Storage) and “gas flows” * which was
meant to improve the North-South link;

™ contributing to the development of renewable gas by encouraging
the injection of biomethane into the transmission network and
promoting research on maximizing the benefit of surplus
renewable energy (power to gas);

= continuing to grow internationally, in countries where gas
consumption is growing fast, in close collaboration with other
Group entities.

1.3.5 Energy Services business line

13.51 Role

Environmental and energy efficiency is a European priority in the fight
against global warming and one of the major aims in sustainable
development policies for companies and local authorities worldwide.

It is one of the major elements in the energy transition, and is the
core business of GDF SUEZ Energy Services. More-efficient energy
use means obtaining optimal service that reduces both the overall
energy bill as well as its environmental impact.

European leader in energy services, the Energy Services business line
offers, via the Cofely brand, environmental and energy-efficient solutions
to its industrial, tertiary, local authorities, public administration, and
infrastructure customers through services which are:

= multi-technical (e.g. electrical, thermal or HVAC engineering and
system integration);

= multi-service (engineering, installation, maintenance, operation
and facilities management);

= multi-energy (e.g. renewable energy sources and gas); and
= multi-country.

They cover the entire technical services value chain from design,
installation and maintenance of equipment to the management of
energy and_ utilities, multi-maintenance technical and long-term
facilities management. GDF SUEZ Energy Services supports its
customers throughout the life cycle of their facilities and their sites,
allowing them to get the most out of their assets, manage their
costs more efficiently, improve their energy efficiency, and focus on
their core activity. It develops local energy generation plants that
include an increasing range of renewable energy sources, such as
biomass, geothermal and solar energy. In addition, it is capable — in
terms of technical expertise, project management, contract
relations, and geographical networking — to meet the challenges
that numerous industrial and service sector customers face:

(1) In 2013, GRTgaz sold its shares in Austrian carrier BOG and increased its stake in MEGAL from 44% to 49%.

(2) GRTgaz is a gas store and transmits it to the Fos terminal when the network transmission and terminal storage capacity allows.

INNOVATION, RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGIES POLICY

1.5.1 Innovation
To be leader in the energy transition in Europe, the Group relies on
innovation to meet its customers’ new requirements.

GDF SUEZ created a new entity in February 2014 called
“Innovation, Marketing and New Business”, intended to support
changes on mature energy markets and the convergence between
energy services and information technologies. Its aim is to position
the Group at the forefront of these changes by developing additional
growth vectors and new ways of doing business within the Group.
Three priority sectors have been identified by the Group:

m Energy management, aggregation, decentralized generation, and
energy storage,

= Cities, regions and mobility,

m Energy efficiency and home comfort.

New tools and processes have been deployed to foster

entrepreneurial creativity and to ensure that innovation promotes the

Group’s long-term commercial development. A social network for

innovation, “innov@GDFSUEZ", was launched in mid-2014 for

Group employees. This internal tool is intended to boost the

innovation dynamic in the Group and promote innovation among

employees. At December 31, 2014, innov@GDFSUEZ had over

6,000 members. On average, five new product or business ideas

are submitted each week.

In addition, an incubation process for employee projects has been
created. At December 31, 2014, five teams of Group employees
were developing their projects in external incubators created from

partnerships with organizations such as Paris Région Lab (France),
Le Village (France), and WSL (Belgium).

This process enriches existing initiatives such as the Trophées de
l'innovation (“Innovation Awards”), an in-house competition held
each year for innovative projects submitted by Group employees. In
2014, the sixth annual Innovation Awards attracted over 500
submissions.

To strengthen its links with the innovation eco-system in the regions
where it operates, the Group partners with major innovation-themed
events and has launched several calls for projects to startups.
GDF SUEZ has also launched a number of public initiatives: a
“Hackathon” on customer relations in June 2014, an “innovation
mornings” cycle in October 2014, and an “Innovation Day” in Lille in
November 2014.

A GDF SUEZ New Ventures investment fund with a €100 million
endowment was launched in May 2014 to back innovative startups.
This fund was designed to take minority stakes in developing
startups linked to the Group’s activities by offering them dual
leverage: financial leverage through investment and operational
leverage with the Group's subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2014 one program had been adopted, Powerdale
(Belgium), and four others were in process.

The Group is conducting cross-cutting projects to foster the
emergence of new products based on digital technologies such as.
Cit’Ease, a collaborative urban management tool, and Terr’Innove, a
regional energy management system.

1.5.2 Research and Technologies

The Group’s expertise is enriched by a dynamic research and
development policy supported by an international network of
research centers and partnerships with globally-recognized
organizations. More than 900 researchers contribute to
technological excellence in all the Group's activities. In 2014,
expenditure on research and technological development amounted
to €189 million.

GDF SUEZ conducts researches to manage and bring to maturity
tomorrow's technologies, which will make all the difference in
setting apart the offers and activities of its businesses. Research is
also carried out to improve operational performance. Prospective
corporate research programs fall under the following priorities:
low-carbon energy, energy distribution and storage, smart energy
management, and new gas value chains.

In 2014, the Research & Technologies department expanded
internationally with the setting up of a laboratory in Chile and
another in Singapore. At the beginning of 2015, a third has been
established in the Middle East. It is also creating new centers of
expertise within its laboratories, the first of which is a new center of

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

expertise for batteries. Others being studied, concern important and
varied subjects such as digital, 3D printing and drones.

In 2014 the Research & Technologies Department won a number of
awards. At the International Gas Union Research Conference
(IGRC), it won the Dan Dolenc Award for best communications
during the conference on a research activity for the Valenthin project
on recovering heat from low-temperature sources. The R&T
Department also won the multi-energy judges’ special award at the
Paris Smart Grid colloquium for the collaborative GRHYD hydrogen
energy storage demonstrator project (manufacture and distribution
of hydrogen produced from a renewable power source).

Highlights from the 2014 corporate programs:

= Cities and buildings of the future: finalization of Cit’Ease, the
interactive city dashboard (first demonstrator in Mulhouse), and
Citizen, the interface where citizens can learn about their city as
well as report problems (first demonstrator in Croix); creation with
a partner of a 3D simulator for the sustainable city (case study:
the city of Astana in Kazakhstan); launch of the development
project on innovative digital services that promote energy
efficiency, campus eco-management with the University of

2 RISK FACTORS

The material risks to which the Group is exposed, based on its own assessment, are described below. Other risks not mentioned or unknown
to date could also affect the Group. If these risks were to occur, they could have a significant negative impact on the Group’s operations,

financial position and earnings, image and outlook, and/or on the GDF SUEZ share price.

2.1 RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

2.1.1 Enterprise risk management policy

The Group has adopted a policy of Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM), whose principles are consistent with professional standards
(including ISO 31000, Federation of European Risk Management
Associations). The policy sets out GDF SUEZ’s ambition to “better
manage its risks in order to ensure its performance”.

The Group's Enterprise Risk Management policy applies throughout
the Group, including all business processes and controlled entities,
while observing the rules of governance that apply to each entity.

This policy promotes risk-taking at a reasonable level from a legal
perspective, and which is acceptable to generally held opinion and
economically viable. It stipulates that all managers are risk
managers. The Management Committees of the Group’s entities are
the main bodies that determine the actions to be taken to manage
risk, except where an ad hoc risk committee has been created,
such as for market risk.

To achieve this aim, the Group has appointed the Executive
Committee member, Director of Audit and Risk Management as
Chief Risk Officer, to oversee risk management activities. The Chief

2.1.2 Crisis management

GDF SUEZ may have to face crisis situations. The Group has
defined a crisis management and communication policy, which sets.
out general operating principles and the roles of the various
participants, and it has set up a dedicated organization.

2.1.3 Risk and insurance coverage

The GDF SUEZ Insurance Department is responsible for preparing,
establishing and managing insurance programs in the areas of
Group asset protection (against property damage and losses in
earnings), personal protection, third-party claims (civil liability) and
automobile insurance and prevention.

For each of these areas:

m the amounts insured depend on the financial risks resulting from
potential claim scenarios and coverage conditions offered by the
market (available capacities and tariff conditions);

m the optimization of the financing of low or moderate-level hazard
risks is based largely on self-insurance plans, either directly
through deductibles and retentions, or indirectly through the use
of the Group's reinsurance company, whose commitments, on a
cumulative basis, represent a maximum estimated loss of
approximately 0.2% of the Group’s 2014 revenues.

However, the Group could, in certain cases, be required to pay out

sizeable compensation that the current insurance program does not
cover or could incur very high costs that its insurance policies do.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

RISK FACTORS.
2.1 RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Risk Officer's role is to ensure that the Group has adequate
competence in all areas for effective risk management. Risk analysis
and coordination of action plans are performed in collaboration with
all the Group's support functions.

Each year, the Group's ERM process begins with a risk review by
the General Management Committee: each priority risk identified is
coordinated by a member of the Executive Committee. The ERM
campaign is then launched across the Group, setting out guidelines
for risk management throughout the year. Finally, the Audit
Committee examines the risk review and issues an opinion on the
effectiveness of the risk management system, before reporting to
the Board of Directors (see Section 4.1.5, “Standing Committees of
the Board of Directors”).

Knowledge of risks resulting from feedback from operating entities,
business lines and support functions is supplemented by interviews
with directors, analysis of publications by external observers and
review of major events.

The Group is thus equipped with a warning, analysis and
decision-making system that determines how and at what strategic
level to handle the crisis (site, BU, business line or Corporate).

The efficiency of the system and the way that it is structured
(emergency plans, business continuity plans, etc.) are regularly
assessed using internal controls and appropriate training exercises.

not reimburse or reimburse inadequately. Although the Group has
excellent insurance coverage, specifically with regard to civil liability
and environmental risks, it could be liable beyond the maximum
insured amount or for events not covered (primarily due to the
common insurance exclusions).

2.13.1 Civil liability

A Directors &Officers civil liability program covers the
representatives of GDFSUEZ, its subsidiaries and Group
representatives within its equity holdings.

A general civil liability program (including for environmental damage)
has been taken out for all the Group’s business lines in a total
amount of €800 million, all damages combined. This program
operates either at the first euro of liability or in excess of the
underlying coverage taken out by some regions in the Energy
International business line (usually with cover of $50 million).

RISK FACTORS
2.2 RISKS RELATED TO THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

2.1.3.2 Nuclear civil liability

As an operator of nuclear power plants in Doel and Tihange
(Belgium), Electrabel’s civil liability is governed by the Paris and
Brussels Conventions. These established a unique system that
departs from ordinary law to ensure that victims receive
compensation and to encourage solidarity among signatory
countries.

This liability falls exclusively on the operator of the facility where the
nuclear accident occurs. In exchange for this strictly objective
liability, the amount of compensation is capped per accident and by
a 10-year statute of limitations. The signatory states to the
conventions also created a mechanism that provides additional
compensation beyond this maximum amount.

The nuclear civil liability insurance program taken out by Electrabel
was adapted with effect from January 1, 2012 to comply with the
Belgian national law requiring the operator to provide financial
guaranties or to take out civil liability insurance up to €1.2 billion.

2.13.3 Property damage

The Group's business lines have property insurance covering the
facilities that they own, lease or manage on behalf of third parties,
with the exception of transmission and distribution network pipelines
in France. The main programs provide cover based either on new
replacement value or on contractual limits per loss event. In the
latter case, the limits are set on the basis of major scenarios in

accordance with insurance market rules and available offers (cost
and capacity).

Insurance covering business interruption and additional operating
costs is taken out based on each risk analysis and in consideration
of existing risk mitigation plans.

Construction projects are covered by “Erection All Risks” programs
taken out by the owner or operator, project manager or prime
contractor.

Exploration-production activity, which is carried out primarily
off-shore, is covered by a specific insurance program tailored to this
sector's risks and in accordance with its practices.

2134 Marine liability

An insurance contract covers LNG transportation by LNG vessel,
limited to €50 million per shipment.

Marine insurance contracts cover liability as ship owner (limited to
$6 billion, except for war risk limited to $500 million and pollution
risk limited to $1 billion) or as charterer (limited to $750 million).
Damage to ships is covered up to their agreed value.

2.13.5 Employee protection programs

The operating entities develop programs covering employees
against the risk of accidents and medical expenses, in accordance
with legislation in effect and pursuant to company agreements.

2.2 RISKS RELATED TO THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

The Group is sensitive to the structural and economic risk factors
that affect the energy sector. These risks are all analyzed and
measured as part of strategic planning processes that allow the

Group to anticipate and prepare for changes in the external
environment. The Group’s research and innovation policy also helps
to deal with strategic developments (see Section 1.5.1 “Innovation”).

2.2.1 Economic environment

221.1 Structure of demand

A slowdown in economic activity could have a knock-on effect of
reduced demand for energy and related services from our
customers, affecting the Group’s business volumes and margins.

In Europe, there is a structural decline in demand for gas and
electricity, associated, among other things, with improvements in
energy performance (new and existing buildings, networks,
industrial processes), regulations, and more conscious use of
energy by consumers.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

In non-OCDE countries, energy demand is growing, but is sensitive
to the level of economic growth in these countries.

In view of these risks, monitoring mechanisms have been set up
and business models adjusted. The Group’s geographic and
sectoral diversity provides a means of mitigation. In addition, the
Group has a range of energy services that it offers to industrial,
business and residential customers, both inside and outside
Europe, to meet the specific requirements of the energy transition.

www.gdfsuez.com


--- Page 52 ---

221.2 Structure of supply

Lack of growth in Europe and the competitiveness of coal have
created an overcapacity for the Group in its fleet of thermal plants.
Stagnating natural gas demand could also result in overcapacity in
the European gas infrastructures.

Policies aiming at reducing CO, emissions, renewable energy
support systems and other regulatory and tax systems, increase the
complexity of the competitive balance among different forms of
energy and can firstly compromise the profitability of existing assets,
and secondly create uncertainty over relevant technology choices.
for the future (including gas, renewables, nuclear and coal).

In the short term, the Group is rationalizing its generation fleet. The
Group closed or mothballed several generation units in 2014 (see
1.3.1.5 “2014 Highlights”). In the medium-term, the Group intends
to propose a new energy market model in Europe, specifically as
part of the Magritte initiative”. In the longer term, a technology
watch enables the Group to develop strategic scenarios that
anticipate changes in the energy mix.

2.21.3 Competitive environment

In its different businesses, the Group competes with major
international players and emerging players in the private and public
sectors.

Deregulation of electricity and gas markets, both in Europe and the
United States, opened the door to new competitors and reinforced

RISK FACTORS.
2.2 RISKS RELATED TO THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

market price volatility. Competitive pressure has a_ significant
negative effect on the selling prices, margins and market share of
the Group’s companies. The sustained economic slowdown in
Europe is further exacerbating this risk.

The emergence of smart energy technologies impacts the gas and
electricity value chain, with new competitors from information
technology, telecommunications and equipment manufacturers.

The Group is rationalizing its operations and processes to adapt its
cost structure, enhance its integrated position on the value chain,
and develop offers tailored to changes in its environment.

2.2.14 Business model

The energy sector is changing rapidly: in technologies (solar and
wind power and electricity storage), in customer requirements, due
to new competitors and due to increased digitization in the sector.
In response to these changes, the Group has implemented a
structure dedicated to innovation and new activities with
representatives in the business lines, so that its customers can be
provided with tailored solutions.

Concerns associated with climate change and the improved
competitiveness of renewable energy sources have had an effect on
the Group's traditional activities. The Group's strategy is focused on
developing renewable energy sources and developing services
specifically for the energy transition.

2.2.2 Regulatory and political environment

The legal and regulatory landscape for the Group’s businesses is
changing in terms of both environmental and social issues and due
to energy sector regulation.

2.2.2.1 Environmental and societal laws

The Group's businesses are subject to a host of laws and
regulations that address environmental protection, promote energy
systems with zero or low greenhouse gas emissions, reduce energy
consumption, protect health and develop safety standards. All these
measures could have a significant impact on the Group:

m European climate change and energy policy to the 2030 horizon
is aimed at promoting energy efficiency, reducing CO, emissions,
and increasing the contribution of renewable energy sources to
the energy mix;

m™ French law on the energy transition and the associated texts
address these topics, as well as the mechanisms financing the
fight against fuel poverty, and the promotion of energy efficiency.
The mechanisms in place to support renewable energy sources
are expected to develop to enable greater market exposure, in
accordance with the European guidelines, while competitive

bidding will be introduced for hydro concessions, with greater
involvement by public-private companies;

= changes in regulations on CO, quotas affect the market price of
CO, in Europe, and have consequences for the relative
competition between natural gas and coal power generation;
increasing numbers of countries are adopting such regulations;

m the revision of the policy document referring to the best available
techniques for large combustion facilities could lead to substantial
changes at some European sites;

m the EU Directive on energy efficiency adopted in late 2012 has to
be transposed into the various Member State laws and entails, in
France, for example, a doubling of the Energy Savings
Certificates (ESC) obligation in the third period (2015-2017),
which could have an impact on the Group’s margins in France;

Changing or tightening regulations could entail additional investment

or operating costs for the Group.

The Group is rationalizing its generation fleet and its project portfolio
so that it can take advantage of opportunities, and is working to limit
all of these risks, principally as part of a proactive environmental and
social protection policy (see Section 3.3, “Environmental
information”).

RISK FACTORS
2.2 RISKS RELATED TO THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

2.222 Sector regulations

In some Member States and at European level, and in a number of
countries, including the United States, Australia and Brazil, public
measures have been implemented in the energy sector through
regulation and the extension of regulatory powers in the area of
competition. They can occur by the “overtaxation” of the profits
made by energy companies (particularly nuclear production in
Belgium), the withdrawal of funds established for the dismantling of
nuclear power plants, by changes to the market operating rules and
supply security, by the regulator’s intervention in the deregulated
sector to encourage the development of competition or else by the
desire to hand back control of utilities to local authorities. National
budget deficits and high levels of indebtedness contribute to
increase this risk.

Some draft regulatory developments may alter the risk profile of the
Group and impact its earnings and its business model:

=m on February 25, 2015, the European Commission published the
key elements of its “Energy Union” policy. Some developments
are positive, such as the formalization of an energy and climate
framework for 2030 based on a stronger carbon market, and the
redesign of the electricity market model. Others might have a
negative impact on the Group’s activities, such as a centralized
gas purchasing body, supervision of intergovernmental
agreements, security of gas supply, and the reworking of the
Third Energy Package;

m= the implementation of common rules for the European internal
electricity and gas market, as well as technical application
measures (electricity and gas network codes, currently in
development) are intended to complete the creation of a real
internal energy market. These changes may require the technical
adjustment of our operations;

m= in February 2013, the European Commission adopted a Council
Directive proposal to levy a tax on financial transactions whose
entry into force is scheduled early 2016. The implementing
provisions, specifically the criteria for the inclusion of businesses
in the financial institution category, have yet to be agreed by the
Member States participating in enhanced cooperation;

m the guidelines on state aid for energy and the environment,
published in the Official Journal of the European Union on
June 28, 2014, have now come into effect. The effects on the
Group's business will mainly relate to national support
mechanisms for renewable energy sources (to gradually integrate
them into the market) and energy efficiency, infrastructure
financing, environmental tax exemptions and fee waivers on the

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

financing of renewables (preferential rates for industrial partners),
and capacity payment mechanisms;

= in Brazil, the Group is exposed to regulatory changes on
electricity markets. For example, in the event of drought the
government could announce restrictions on water usage for
power generation;

m in the United States, the development of electricity market
regulation (primarily in Texas) could lead to uncertainty in terms of
the Group earnings in this region.

Through concerted action as part of the initiative commonly known

as “Magritte”, which brings together the CEOs of the European

energy companies, and through its direct presence in EU and

Member State institutions, the Group tries to anticipate any

legislation likely to affect the Group, and formulates proposals for

decision-makers. It is hard to predict all regulatory changes in each
country, but the Group partially limits this risk through diversification,
by conducting its business in multiple countries. However, some
regulatory developments offer new market opportunities for the
Group’s activities.

In addition, other risks are discussed in Section 1, through the
description of the legislative and regulatory framework in which the
different entities operate.

2.22.3 Controlled, administered or regulated
tariffs

In France, a portion of the Group’s sales are made in the context of
administered tariffs. French laws and rules, European regulation and
decisions by regulators (in particular, the French Energy Regulation
Commission (CRE) for decisions on tariffs for access to certain
infrastructures) may affect the Group’s sales, profits or profitability,
in the event of the partial impact of procurement, infrastructure and
commercial costs on natural gas selling prices or the partial impact
of costs on gas infrastructure access tariffs or electricity sales from
renewable energy.

Also, in France the opening of the electricity market to suppliers
other than the traditional operator, in addition to the opening for very
large customers, is still limited and could be jeopardized by the
emergence of price reduction arising from regulated tariffs that
replace and compete with commercial offers.

Price control mechanisms also exist in other countries, specifically
Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Brazil and Mexico, for energy
generation, distribution and sales.

www.gdfsuez.com


--- Page 54 ---

2.2.24 Societal acceptability

To engage in its activities, the Group must hold various permits and
authorizations. Dealing with the regulatory authorities concerned to
obtain or renew these can be a long and costly process. In addition,
the Group may face opposition from the local population or
associations during the installation or operation of certain
equipment, or in relation to public energy price protests.

The Group therefore implements widespread consultation upstream
of its projects, forges partnerships with civil society and ensures the
positive economic impact of its activities, in line with community
expectations (see Section 3.4 “Societal information”).

2.2.25 Country risk

Due to the diversity of its locations, the Group is exposed to country
risk (Sovereign default, convertibility, expropriation, etc.). The Group
is present in countries such as Brazil, Chile, Thailand, Indonesia,
Mexico, India and Peru, which are undergoing mixed economic and

RISK FACTORS.
2.2 RISKS RELATED TO THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

political developments. A significant share of gas supplies and
exploration-production business comes from countries such as
Russia, Algeria, Yemen, Libya and Egypt.

These countries are associated with political, economic, regulatory
and financial risks. In addition, the Group might be unable to defend
its rights before the local courts in some countries in the event of a
dispute with the government or other local public entities.

The diversity of the Group’s locations results in some mitigation of
country risk: 85% of revenues are generated in Europe and North
America, 10% in Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific and 5% in
South America. The Group also manages these risks within
partnerships or contractual negotiations adapted to each location. It
chooses its locations by applying a formal investment procedure:
that appraises risk. The inclusion of international arbitration clauses
in contracts is applied as widely as possible. Regular monitoring of
economic and non-economic indicators relating to corruption,
human development, and inequality is done in each country to
assess the Group’s exposure to country risk.

2.2.3 Impact of Climate

Significant climate changes (mainly in temperature, but also in terms
of water availability” and wind) from one year to the next can cause
substantial fluctuations in the electricity and gas supply-demand
balance. These factors, which combine price and volume impacts,
have a direct effect on the Group’s income.

Beyond these annual changes, there has been a warming of the
average climate, although periods of extreme cold are possible in
Europe. Regulations require suppliers to provide storage capacities
according to their customer portfolio; if supplier bookings are not

adequate, it could lead to strong pressure on the supply/demand
balance for gas in Europe, including France.

Although the Group cannot protect itself against fluctuations in
demand, it is able to modulate its gas purchases and rationalize its
electricity production, which enables it to adapt its production and
supply costs (see Section 2.3.1 “Purchases and sales”).

In the longer term, the Group is looking at ways of combining
sustainable development and managing the impact of climate
change on its business.

2.2.4 Reputational risk

The Group is exposed to reputational risk, both directly and
indirectly, especially when the Group’s values, its operational
excellence or its legitimacy as a utility are called into question.

The flagship brand “GDF SUEZ” (name and logotype) is registered in
over one hundred countries. As a vital part of the Group’s intangible
corporate assets, the brand is constantly monitored to protect it
against any fraudulent use that could harm the Group’s image.

(1) Availabilty of water resources for a dam or waterway, dependent on rainfall

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

Through its policies, organization, procedures and governance, the
Group endeavors to prevent operational risks (see Section 2.3,
“Operating risks”) and smear campaigns that could affect its
reputation.

RISK FACTORS
2.3 OPERATING RISKS

2.3 OPERATING RISKS

2.3.1 Purchases and sales

2.3.11 Purchase and sale of natural gas

The Group has established a portfolio composed in part of
long-term, take-or-pay contracts (see Section 1.3.1.6.1, “Central
Western Europe”).

In case of major gas supply interruption (for example, due to an
interruption of Russian deliveries or an interruption of transit in
Ukraine), the replacement cost for gas, including transportation,
could be higher and affect the Group’s margins. To control this risk,
the Group has a number of tools for flexibility and modulation
(flexibility in long-term contracts, storage and regasification capacity,
and purchasing in the marketplaces) as well as a diversified
portfolio.

Prices of long-term purchase contracts (partially indexed to the
price indices of oil products) may be decorrelated from selling prices
or prices in the gas markets: this spread might have a significant
impact on the Group’s results. Long-term contracts include price
adjustment clauses, so that the economic balance between
producer and buyer can be altered. The Group’s buy/sell margin
may therefore change according to price adjustments in LNG or
gaseous gas contracts.

Negotiations in recent years have led to the integration of market
indices in long-term contracts and/or to the reduction of the
difference between the contract price and market price. They have
also led to an increased frequency in price revisions.

2.3.12 Purchase and sale of electricity

The Group is an electricity producer in Europe, the United States
and Australia, where the profitability of its assets is linked mainly to
prices in electricity markets. The economic climate or decisions by
some states regarding the electricity sector may lead to volatility in
electricity prices, which may have an impact on Group earnings.

The Group may also have to buy power to supply its customers, for
example to cover any non-availability of its fleet. These purchases.
are rationalized but could generate extra supply costs.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

The Group monitors changes in its risk exposure and makes
decisions accordingly (see Section 2.5.1, “Commodities market
risk”).

2.3.13 Operational risks related to the purchase
and sale of energy

The main risks related to regulated sales are outlined in
Sections 2.2.2.2 “Sector regulations” and 2.2.2.3 “Controlled,
administered or regulated rates”.

In its portfolio optimization activities for physical assets (power
plants, long-term contracts, etc.) and customers, as well as in
managing the associated financial positions, the Group is exposed
to operating risks such as fraud, execution error, and process and
system failure. Operations are monitored via appropriate processes,
and risks are taken into account as part of the Group’s internal
control program, “INCOME”. In addition, a specific system for
increased monitoring of operating risks has been set up in the
Group’s various business lines.

2.3.14 Purchase risks and supply chain risks
(excluding energy)

The performance of the Purchasing and Procurement function and
its ability to manage the associated risks affect all of the Group’s
activities. Management of purchasing and supplier risks is
monitored at Group level specifically, external risks that are
regarded as having the biggest impact, such as the failure of a
major supplier, or the dependence of a Group entity on a critical
supplier, or vice versa.

The implementation of purchasing management by category, i.e. by
homogenous supplier market, has strengthened processes for
selecting and qualifying suppliers, and has enabled their
performance to be monitored, thereby limiting the impact of these
risks on the Group’s activities. Similarly, for new projects, risk
management covers specific purchase and supplier/subcontractor
risks (see Section 2.3.2.2 “Risks related to development and major
projects”).

RISK FACTORS.
2.3 OPERATING RISKS

2.3.2 Management of assets and development

2.3.21 Optimization of the asset and investment
portfolio

External expansion, notably by means of acquisitions, could lead the
Group to issue equity securities, or to borrow. Acquisitions present
risks related to integration difficulties and failure to achieve expected
benefits and synergies. Risks related to the valuation of assets or
liabilities or non-achievement of expected results could arise at the
end of the acquisition process, resulting in provisions for asset
impairment. The Group also sells assets for which it may retain
certain liability guarantees.

The acquisition processes implemented by the Group, particularly
during due diligences, aim to assess to the greatest possible extent
the uncertainties related to these risks in such cases. The resulting
appraisal depends on the quality of the information transmitted to
the Group and is limited by the judicial and regulatory framework
applicable under local corporate law.

2.3.2.2 Risks related to development and major
projects

The Group bases its growth on various major industrial construction
projects, such as gas and electricity plants and dams, where it
usually acts as owner and/or operator. The profitability of these
assets — whose service life is several decades — depends greatly on
cost control and construction times, the operational performance of
the industrial asset, external phenomena (e.g. natural disasters and
strike actions), regulatory and fiscal changes and changes in the
competitive environment and markets over the long term, which
could reduce the profitability of certain assets or result in lost
revenues or asset impairment.

The implementation of contract management arrangements allows
for better control of some of these risks, including through the use
of indemnification mechanisms, in respect of our customers and off
takers, as well as our suppliers and subcontractors.

The Group is also responsible for the facility design and
construction phases of some projects. Although these projects are
always subject to in-depth studies and the Group has
acknowledged expertise, construction deadlines may not always be
met resulting in penalties, construction costs may be higher than
anticipated, the facilities’ performance may not comply with the
specifications and subsequent accidents may trigger the Group’s
civil liability, professional indemnity or criminal liability. This could
have a negative impact on the Group’s image, financial situation, or
earnings.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

The Group has strengthened operational monitoring and oversight
of projects and is monitoring the portfolio of projects at Group level,
which provides the warnings needed to launch corrective action.

2.3.23 Risk linked to nuclear development

The Group actively pursues its projects in the development,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. The Group has
teamed up with Toshiba Westinghouse (AP1000 technology) in the
United Kingdom, and is also a member of a consortium formed with
Japanese groups Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Itochu (ATMEA1
technology) in Turkey.

It should be noted that these projects are currently still in the
pre-development stage, and that the Group’s financial exposure is
therefore not material.

The Group has established governance principles for development,
construction, operation and decommissioning based on_ its
experience as a nuclear power plant operator. It is also active in
employee recruitment, training and retention, both for facilities in
operation, service entities and Group projects.

2.3.24 Risks relating to partnerships and minority
investments

Partnerships and acquisitions of minority interests are one of the
ways in which the Group can share the economic and financial risks
inherent to some projects, by limiting its capital employed and
allowing it to adapt more appropriately to the specific context of
local markets (see Note 4 to Section 6.2 “Consolidated Financial
Statements”). As much as possible, the Group protects itself against
the risks resulting from joint control or lack of control (such as a lack
of information or an impact on the Group’s reputation) with the
signing of shareholders’ agreements on governance and information
reporting, and with the role of the director representing the Group.

However, changes to the project, the economic situation, the
partner's strategy or even the local political and economic
environment may, in some cases, lead to the failure of a partnership
or changes in its control or governance, a change of control or a
partnership's governance, or to a disinvestment.

These situations may lead the Group to develop contractual
arrangements for deadlock resolution or, in the event of conflict with
the partner(s), to seek a solution before the relevant courts or
arbitration bodies.

RISK FACTORS
2.3 OPERATING RISKS

2.3.3 Legal risks

The Group faces legal risks in all of its businesses and in global
markets. The risks arising from the legal and regulatory framework,
from operations, from partnerships and from contracts signed with
customers and suppliers are mentioned in the respective
subsections of this Chapter 2.

In the course of its operations, the Group is engaged in a certain
number of legal disputes and arbitration procedures, and is also
subject to investigations and procedures. The main investigations

and procedures are described in Note 28 of Section 6.2,
“Consolidated Financial Statements”. With the exception of these
procedures, and to the Company’s knowledge, no other
governmental, legal or arbitration procedure (including a suspended
or threatened procedure" exists that is likely to have, or has had,
material impact on the financial position or profitability of the
Company and/or Group in the past 12 months.

2.3.4 Ethical risks

Any breach of the ethical principles of the Group could expose it to
ethical and legal risks (see Note 28 of Section 6.2, “Consolidated
Financial Statements”). Ethics policies are developed to avoid, as far
as possible, the occurrence of such risks. The Ethics and

Compliance Division promotes their implementation within the
Group, through the managerial line and the network of Compliance
Officers (see Section 3.1, “Ethics and compliance”). The ethical risks
identified are analyzed and action plans are implemented.

2.3.5 Risks related to human resources

2.3.5.1 Expertise

Developments in the Group's activities (the impact of digitization, for
example), as well as its international growth, requires new
know-how and the mobility of certain employees. In addition,
demographic aging affects specific technical sectors. An active
policy of mobility between entities and between activities, combined
with policies for professionalization, for the development of support
functions, for the recognition of experts, and for attractiveness,
through remuneration measures and incentives tailored for the
environment, is also implemented (see Section 3.2.1, “Human
resources development policies”). The Group is also working
towards the launch of a professional observatory, to increase its
capacity for anticipating and taking action in respect of changes in
its activities.

2.3.5.2 Social dialogue

The Group must become more agile in order to adapt to its
changing markets, particularly with regards to increased
competition and evolution of its activities. In this context,
consultation and negotiation play their part in governing social
relations.

GDF SUEZ is respectful of all representational bodies. In Europe,
GDF SUEZ dialogues with the two staff representative bodies, the

(1) This term means investigations or controls that have begun.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

European Works Council and the French Group Works Council, to
support the transformations in progress (see Section 3.2.3, “Social
relations”). This framework means that social partners are involved
at the earliest possible moment in the strategic and _ industrial
objectives pursued by GDF SUEZ.

As part of its development strategy outside Europe, the Group
regularly holds discussions with Global Union federations.

2.3.5.3 Quality of life in the workplace and
managerial behaviors

The implementing of appropriate terms of engagement, the
motivation of its employees and the prevention of psychosocial risks
are part of the Group’s core strategy.

The Group invests in the promotion of behavior that helps in the
development of staff, relying in particular on the deployment of the
“GDF SUEZ Management Way” (see Section3.2 “Social
information”). Particular attention is also paid to the managerial
chain to provide assistance in its role in change management.

Processes are deployed at the most appropriate level: being
attentive to employees (call numbers, barometer surveys, etc.),
quality of life in the workplace programs, information on career
development, development of expertise and internal mobility.

RISK FACTORS.
2.4 INDUSTRIAL RISKS

2.3.6 Risks related to health and safety and protection of Group assets

2.3.6.1 Health and safety at work

The Group is committed to eradicating fatal accidents and reducing
occupational accidents and illnesses. The Group policy outlining the
principles of this approach was agreed with the union federations at
European level and subsequently worldwide, and an action plan
was drawn up for 2010-2015 (see Section 3.2.6, “Health and safety
policy”).

Addressing the risk of death at the workplace is part of the overall
system for controlling the risk of industrial accidents. However, a
specific plan for the sustainable mitigation of fatal accidents was.
launched in 2012. It relies specifically on nine “lifesaving rules” to
prevent the reoccurrence of past fatal accidents.

2.3.6.2 Employee safety

The international scope of the Group means it may be exposed to a
number of health and safety risks, the threat of which warrants a
specific organization entrusted to the Safety Department which has
established a country watch. As such, the Group is required to
continuously assess the risks of terrorism, armed conflicts and
confrontation with criminal organizations. Geographic areas are
subject to classification according to specific prevention and
protection measures. To accomplish this mission, the Group relies

2.3.7 Risks related to information systems

The introduction of new technologies (e.g. Cloud Computing, Bring
Your Own Device), the evolution of industrial control systems and
the development of new uses (e.g. social networking) expose the
Group to new threats. Cyber-attacks and hacking attempts are
increasingly targeted and carried out by specialists, and can target
the company along with its customers or partners. More generally,
system failure could result in information losses or leaks, delays and

2.4 INDUSTRIAL RISKS

The areas of activity in which the Group operates entail major
industrial risks capable of causing harm to persons and property,
and exposing it to claims for civil, criminal and environmental liability.
These risks may concern facilities belonging to the Group or
managed by the Group on behalf of third parties (industrial clients or

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

on State services as well as specialized providers. Should a specific
situation occur, the crisis unit can be mobilized to provide
exceptional resources, for instance in the event of an evacuation.

2.3.6.3 Protection of tangible and intangible
Group assets

The Group's sites and industrial or tertiary facilities, which make up
its tangible Group assets, may be exposed to malicious acts.
Information, whether digital, physical or even verbal in form,
constitutes the Group’s intangible assets and may also be exposed
to the same malicious acts.

To combat this type of risk, the Group implements a policy for the
protection of tangible and intangible Group assets, covering
technical (including IT), legal, managerial and organizational areas.
Sensitive sites where tangible corporate assets are located are
subject to protective measures tailored to the local situation and
revised according to the actual threat status. The Group is
continuing to act to protect its intangible Group assets, in order to
prevent any internal or external action aimed at capturing and using
sensitive information and to deal with any incidents or accidents
detected. The Information Security Committee, chaired by the
Secretary General, coordinates and controls all actions by the
Group aimed at protecting its intangible assets.

extra costs that could be detrimental to the Group’s strategy or
image.

In response, the Group has set up prevention and security
measures for its information systems and data that are tailored to
the risks identified. In connection with the Group’s internal control
policy and its security policy, these organizational, functional,
technical and legal security measures are subject to annual checks.

local authorities). The industrial safety of the facilities that the Group
operates is one of its major concerns. The handling of these risks is
subject to in-depth monitoring and specific targeted investments,
audits of the facilities in question are performed regularly.

RISK FACTORS
2.4 INDUSTRIAL RISKS

2.4.1 Industrial facilities and Seveso sites

The Group operates and builds systems for gas transmission,
distribution and storage systems, exploration-production facilities,
LNG tankers, regasification facilities, LPG stations, electrical power
plants, hydro facilities, as well as certain services provided in an
industrial environment. Some of these facilities are high-threshold
Seveso sites (or considered as such by the Group).

Risks can stem, for example, from operating incidents, design flaws
or from external events beyond the Group's control (including
third-party actions and natural disasters). Industrial accidents can
cause injuries, loss of life or major property and/or environmental
damage, as well as activity interruptions and operating losses.

The Group carries out its industrial activities in compliance with a
framework of safety regulations, including the “Seveso II” European
Directive”. These industrial risks are controlled by implementing a
safety management system at each site based on the principle of

continuous improvement, which is intended to reduce the level of
residual risk by responding to the highest risks on a priority basis.
Moreover, the risk of industrial accidents is part of the Group’s
internal control program. The Group conducts periodic inspections
and audit and control missions to ensure that these measures are
effectively implemented.

A specific action plan for the protection of industrial control systems,
linked to industrial processes, is being implemented. It aims to
prevent the risk of activity interruption or accidents due to
cyber-attacks.

For the most part, these risks are covered by insurance policies. In
the event of a major claim, these policies could prove insufficient to
cover all damages incurred, lost revenues, civil liabilities and
increased expenses (see Section 2.1.3 “Risk and insurance
coverage”).

2.4.2 Environmental pollution

Facilities that the Group owns or manages on behalf of third parties
may entail risks of damage to the natural environment (air, water,
soil, the habitat and biodiversity), and may pose health risks to
consumers, neighboring residents, employees and subcontractors.
These health and environmental risks are governed by strict national
and international regulations. Non-compliance with these
environmental standards or a process failure can have a significant
negative impact on the Group's image, its business, financial

situation, earnings and outlook, and lead to the engagement of its
liability as a legal entity. Any amounts set aside, insured or
guaranteed, may be insufficient. Complaints and convictions relating
to the environment are given in Section 3.3.4.9, “Active prevention
of environmental risks”.

Health and environmental risks are regularly monitored by the
Group, by external auditors and by governmental authorities, both
for operational sites and closed facilities, such as former gas plants.

2.4.3 Nuclear power plants in Belgium

The Group owns and operates seven nuclear reactors of the
pressurized water type at two nuclear electricity production sites at
Doel and Tihange in Belgium. Although, since the commissioning of
the first reactor in 1974, these sites have been without any major
nuclear safety incidents that could have resulted in danger to
employees, subcontractors, the general population or the
environment. They could present civil liability risks for the Group,
specifically in the event of a nuclear accident or the discharging of
large quantities of radioactive material into the environment.

All persons working at Group nuclear power plants have appropriate
qualifications, in particular control room operators. During
operations, compliance with safety rules and conditions at the
facilities are subject to inspection by the Belgian Federal Agency for
Nuclear Control (AFCN), assisted by Bel-V, its technical support
subsidiary. In addition, both nuclear sites are OHSAS 18001,
ISO 14001 and EMAS-certified.

Following the nuclear accident at the Fukushima plant in Japan in
March 2011, stress tests were carried out on European nuclear
plants at the request of the European Council. The AFCN confirmed
in its report of November 8, 2011 that the safety level was
adequate. Its final report, published at the end of 2011, requested

that some safety measures be strengthened to take account of
more severe natural disasters.

In 2012, flaw indications in the vessel walls of the Doel 3 and
Tihange 2 reactors were detected. The remaining vessels, of a
different manufacturing, are also under inspection and those already
inspected showed no flaw indication. After analyzing the supporting
reports, the AFCN ruled in favor of restarting Doel 3 and Tihange 2,
but requested a program of additional tests. The two units were
restarted in early June of 2013. They were voluntarily stopped at the
end of March 2014, after results from the additional tests did not
deliver the expected results. In November 2014, a board of experts
convened by the AFCN made requests and additional
recommendations. Electrabel is continuing studies to present a
safety file to the nuclear regulators. The AFCN will then decide
whether to authorize the restarting of Doel 3 and Tihange 2. The
unavailability has been extended to July 1, 2015; beyond that, any
delay in the restart will impact the Group’s 2015 targets.
Note 13.3.1 of Section 6.2, “Consolidated Financial Statements”
provides some measurement of the impairment of the nuclear
assets under different scenarios of a permanent shutdown of the
reactors.

--- Page 60 ---

The Government formed in October 2014 agreed to an extension of
the operating life of Doel1 and Doel2 beyond 40 years. The
economic and financial conditions of such extension are still under
discussion. It was also decided to extend the operating life of
Tihange 1 for 10 years beyond 2015 (see Section 1.3.1 “Energy
Europe”).

The operation of nuclear power plants is regulated in part by
radioactive waste authorizations. The Group therefore reduces its
discharges of radioactive liquid and gaseous effluents to the
possible extent, while controlling the volume of low and medium
radioactive waste. In Belgium, all nuclear waste management is the
responsibility of the National Agency for Radioactive Waste and
Enriched Fissile Material (ONDRAF). In 2013, barrels of medium
radioactive waste from the Doel plant, stored at Belgoprocess, were
subject to additional checks related to the discovery of a gel-like

2.5 FINANCIAL RISKS

substance on the surface of the barrels. However, this issue has no
effect on the safety of the environment or the health of the
population. Studies are in progress in liaison with ONDRAF. The
phenomenon was not detected at the Tihange plant, where a
different encasement process is used, one that does not contain
aggregates.

In addition, spent nuclear fuel is stored at power production sites
pending a political decision on the fuel cycle downstream process.
Costs associated with the management of spent fuel and the
dismantling of facilities are included in the costs of electricity
production from nuclear sources and are the subject of provisions.
The assumptions and sensitivities regarding the assessment of
these amounts are outlined in Note 19.2 of Section 6.2,
“Consolidated financial statements”.

2.4.4 Exploration-Production of hydrocarbons

The exploration and production of hydrocarbons are activities
subject to significant risks such as geological hazards and risks of
major industrial accidents (oil spill, fire, explosion, loss of well
control, etc.).

Geological hazards are related to difficulties in investigating subsoil,
the physical characteristics of oil or gas fields and those of
hydrocarbons. In fact, estimates of discovered reserves must be
large enough and have a positive economic analysis in order for said
reserves to be exploited. During production, reserves may turn out
to be lower than expected and this may adversely affect the
economics of their use.

In order to reduce the impact of these risks, the Group:

™ conducts its activities by sharing risks as part of consortia in
which it may be an operator or simply a partner. As far as

2.5 FINANCIAL RISKS

possible, the Group teams up with companies that are known for
their expertise, rules and high level of commitment to safety and
accident prevention;

= carries out its operations under the rules of a safety management
system (see also Section 2.4.1) based on the ISO 14001 and
OHSAS 18001 international standards, and takes into account
best practices in the E&P industry, particularly those of the
International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP);

m has its hydrocarbon reserves

regularly assessed by an

2.5.1 Commodities market risk

The Group is principally exposed to two types of commodity market
risk: price risks related directly to fluctuating market prices and
volume risks (weather-related and/or dependent on economic
activity). The Group is exposed to these risks, particularly in relation
to gas, electricity, coal, oil and oil products, other fuels, CO, and
other green products (see 6.1.1.8 « Outlook »).

With the exception of trading activities, market risks are assessed
by means of their impact on EBITDA. Accordingly, the main risk
indicators for managing the energy portfolios include sensitivity to
unit price changes, the EBITDA at Risk, portfolio hedging ratios and
stress tests based on predefined unfavorable scenarios. For trading
activities, and in accordance with market standards, risk indicators
include sensitivities, Value at Risk (VaR) and stress tests (see
Note 17.1.1 in Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements”).

The Group has implemented a specific governance process to
control market and counterparty risks based on (i) the general

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

principle of separation of risk management and operational
activities, (ii) a Group-level Energy Market Risks Committee (EMRC)
that is responsible for validating the business lines’ risk policies and
monitoring consolidated exposure, (iii) following a market and
counterparty risk mandate, and (iv) a specific risk control unit
coordinated by the Finance Department.

Most of its electricity production activity outside Europe and the
United States is secured by long-term PPAs, often with local
authorities, in which variations in operating expenses, in particular
fuels, are transferred as “pass-throughs” into electricity sale prices.
This greatly limits exposure to price fluctuation risks, even if the
transfer is imperfect in some contracts.

The Group also uses derivatives to offer hedging instruments to its
clients and to hedge its own positions.

RISK FACTORS
2.5 FINANCIAL RISKS,

2.5.2 Counterparty risk

Due to its financial and operational activities, the Group is exposed
to the risk of default by its counterparties (customers, suppliers,
partners, intermediaries, banks).

The impact of this may be felt in terms of payment (non-payment for
services or deliveries made), delivery (non-delivery of supplies or
services) or assets (loss of financial investments).

2.5.3. Currency risk

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks defined as the
impact on the balance sheet and the income statement of exchange
rate fluctuations as it performs its operational and financial activities.
These are broken down into (i) a transactional risk related to current
operations, (ii) a specific transactional risk related to investment,
merger-acquisition or disposal projects, (iii) a translational risk
related to assets outside the eurozone, and (iv) a risk related to
consolidation in euros of the subsidiaries’ accounts where the
functional currency is other than the euro. This risk is concentrated
in dollar-denominated equity investments (in the United States and
on assets considered on a dollarized basis), as well as equity
investments located primarily in Brazil, Australia and the UK.

These risks are managed via framework agreements that use
standard mechanisms such as third-party guarantees, netting
agreements and margin calls or by the use of dedicated hedging
instruments. Operational activities may also involve prepayments or
suitable recovery procedures (especially for retail customers).

For an analysis of foreign exchange risk sensitivity, see
Note 17.1.3.2 of Section 6.2, “Consolidated financial statements”.

As part of the Group's foreign exchange risk policy, recurring
transactional risk is subject to systematic hedging in cases where
this risk is material and almost certain to materialize. During the
examination of investment projects, the specific transactional risk is
subject to a case-by-case hedging strategy. Finally, translational risk
is covered by partial hedging strategies subject to a reasonable
hedging cost and sufficient market liquidity related to the risk of
currency depreciation.

2.5.4 Interest rate risk

The Group's objective is to control its financing cost by limiting the
impact of interest rate changes on its income statement and, with
this in view, to create a balanced distribution among the various
reference rates over the medium-term. The Group’s policy is
therefore to diversify the net debt reference rates among fixed,
variable and protected variable (“capped variable”) rates. The
distribution may change around the balance point according to the
market situation.

The breakdown by type of interest rates of the outstanding financial
debt and sensitivity analysis for interest rate risks are available in

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

“Consolidated financial statements.”

respectively, of Section 6.2,

In order to manage the interest rate structure for its net debt, the
Group uses hedging instruments, particularly rate swaps and
options. Managed centrally, rate positions are reviewed periodically
and when any new financing is raised. This management is subject
to a risk mandate: any substantial change in the rate structure
requires prior approval from the Finance Department.

2.5.5 Liquidity risk

In its everyday operations, the Group is exposed to the risk of a lack
of liquidity necessary to meet its contractual obligations. WCR
(Working Capital Requirement) consists both of elements resulting
from transactions (customers, stock, suppliers) and margin calls
linked to certain derivatives.

Liquidity is based on the regular renewal of various financing tools
available to the Group such as credit lines, bond financing or other
financing tools, to ensure their availability and their adequacy in
relation to financing requirements. These facilities are pre-agreed
and appropriate for the scale of its operations and for the timing of
contractual debt repayments. Note 16.2.1. in Section 6.2
“Consolidated financial statements” explains the distribution of the

2.5.6 Impairment risk

Assumptions and estimates are made to calculate the recoverable
value of goodwill and tangible and intangible fixed assets, with
particular reference to market outlook, which is more sensitive for
certain operations. These assumptions and estimates are needed to

various forms of financing used. The Group's financing policy is
based on:

= centralizing external financing;

= diversifying sources of financing between the banking market and
the capital markets;

= achieving a balanced debt repayment profile.

GDF SUEZ pools the majority of the cash flow requirements and
surpluses of the Group’s subsidiaries, as well as most of their
medium- and long-term external financing requirements. Financing
vehicles (long-term and short-term) provide centralization, as do the
Group’s dedicated cash-pooling vehicles in France, Belgium and
Luxembourg.

these assumptions could have a significant effect on the amount of
the recoverable value and could lead to changes in the impairment
to be recognized (see Note 1.3.1.2 in Section 6.2, “Consolidated
financial statements’).

2.5.7 Equity risk

As of December 31, 2014, the Group holds a number of
non-consolidated interests in listed companies (see Note 16.1.1 in
Section 6.2, “Consolidated financial statements”), the value of which
fluctuates on the basis of trends in the world stock markets and/or
the position of the relevant companies.

A decline of 10% in the stock market price of these listed securities
would have a negative impact of about -€141 million on the Group’s
overall income. The Group estimates that impairment indicators for
listed securities occur when the value of any such security falls

period.

The Group’s portfolio of listed and unlisted stocks is managed
under a specific investment policy and is subject to regular reporting
to Executive Management.

In addition, the Group holds interests in listed companies
consolidated using the equity method, including SUEZ
Environnement (see Note 4 to Section 6.2, “Consolidated financial
statements”), for which a significant or extended fall in the price
below the value on the balance sheet is an indication of impairment.

2.5 FINANCIAL RISKS,

2.5.9 Pension funding risk

A significant portion of the Group pensions commitments and the
assets associated with these plans are concentrated in France and
Belgium. Other defined-benefit pension plans are mainly located in
Europe, Brazil and Australia.

In recent years the Group has terminated a number of
defined-benefit plans and replaced them with defined-contribution
plans. The defined-benefit plans still in operation notably include, in
France, the special electricity and gas industry (EGI) plan, which is a
legal statutory plan.

Note 20 of Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements” details
the items evaluated and recognized.

The calculation of commitments is estimated with actuarial methods
using methods, assumptions and models to assess liabilities or
determine asset allocations and associated risks that could have a
significant impact on hedging levels and financing requirements.

In France, commitments within the scope of the special EGI
statutory plan are estimated using actuarial assumptions and rules
respectively governing benefits paid out by plans operating under
ordinary law and amounts that remain the Group’s responsibility.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

These assumptions and rules may be subject to changes that
increase the Group’s commitments and therefore require an
increase in the relevant provisions.

Substantial commitments exist in the form of other
post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits, in addition
to pension liabilities. These mainly comprise energy-related benefits
provided to retired employees within the scope of EGI.

Hedging levels and financing requirements for the Group’s pension
plans vary according to the performance of financial markets and
asset allocations, as well as interest and inflation rates and changes.
in the applicable legal and regulatory framework.

For some plans outside the scope of the EGI, GDF SUEZ may be
required to fully or partly finance any difference between the market
value of these assets and the hedging levels projected for these
plans, or any insufficiency in the return on the assets in respect of
the guaranteed minimum average rates.

3.1 ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE

3.1 ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE

3.1.1 Ethics policy

GDF SUEZ’s ethics policy aims to develop an ethics culture and
practice based on:

m= the Ethics Charter’, which sets the general framework for the
professional behavior of every employee. It specifies four
fundamental principles: acting in accordance with laws and
regulations; establishing a culture of integrity; behaving fairly and
honesty; and respecting others. It also describes the ethics
governance system;

m the “Ethics in Practice” guidelines,” which specify the
implementation procedures for ethics in business situations on a
daily basis;

3.1.2 Organization and structures

The senior executives of GDF SUEZ, particularly the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and the General Secretary, member of the
Executive Committee and the Group Ethics Officer, promote and
oversee the ethics policy and ensure that it is properly applied.

The ethics and compliance organization is overseen by the Board of
Directors. The Ethics, Environment and Sustainable Development
Committee, which reports to the Board, assists it with subjects
relating to governance, ethics and compliance.

The Ethics Officer Steering Committee (EOSC) and the Compliance
Committee (CC), both chaired by the Group Ethics Officer, initiate

structured to manage the risks to which any breach of integrity
exposes it, and sets out the action plan for the prevention of fraud

and implement ethical action plans and compliance procedures in
the business lines and take the necessary monitoring measures.

Within the General Secretariat, the Ethics and Compliance Division
(ECD) draws up ethics action plans and compliance procedures and
monitors achievement of targets. It supports the EOSC and CC in
performing their duties. It drafts the ethics documents and
referentials and promotes their implementation within the Group.
The ECD coordinates a decentralized network of more than 150
ethics officers within the subsidiaries, BUs, business lines and
operating divisions and works closely with all the concerned
departments, including Risk Management, Internal Control, Internal
Audit, Human Resources and Legal.

3.2 SOCIAL INFORMATION

The GDF SUEZ Group is a large and committed employer. The aim
of its Human Resources function is to contribute to the Group’s
transformation in four key areas: anticipating and preparing for the
future; playing a major role alongside managers; increasing the
contribution of individuals and employee groups; and making the
HR function stronger, more attractive and more effective. All HR
actions are closely focused on two cross-cutting aspects: the
Obligation to be committed to the health and safety of everyone, and
the desire to mark our actions and conduct with a social imprint.

At the end of 2013, an engagement survey conducted among
33,000 Group managers helped identify major strengths: a
consistent managerial culture, pride of belonging, strong
commitment and leadership qualities. However, it also highlighted
areas for progress in the development of managerial skills,

m= internal and external audits to assess the implementation of
policies and, where applicable, define actions for improvement.

performance recognition and development of _ attractive
cross-functional career paths. In 2014, a structured action plan of
10 initiatives to support managers in the Group’s transformation
was launched. The first results are already visible: Adaptation of
GDF SUEZ Management Way to the current context, support for its
deployment with a guide called “Putting Management Way Into
Practice” and a self-assessment tool; focus on the “People
Leadership” aspect of Management Way, with a dedicated
e-learning module on the development of employees identified as
future managers; the launch of a full-scale mentoring program
(960 mentor-mentee teams in 2014) to help managers put
Management Way into practice; and Group guidelines on financial
and non-financial recognition.

3.2.1 Human resources development policies

The aim of these policies is to attract, retain and develop all the
Group’s employees, who constitute its human capital and are, as
such, a major strategic asset. These can be found under the generic
heading of: “People for Development, Development for People”: a
development policy for all.

The personal development of employees is a key performance and
development lever for the Group. It requires the cross-functional
and shared knowledge of employees at every level of the
organization (manager and HR manager). The Group also focuses
on in-house talent in preparing for the future, building the skills of
tomorrow, encouraging mobility and thus enhancing individual
employability. The new “Development for People” guidelines bring
together the various HR policies and approaches to amplify their
effects on Group performance and development.

3.211 “Recruiting for Development"

Recruitment is a major aspect of the Group’s development and
transformation.

Spearheading the external recruitment strategy (which is intended to
make GDF SUEZ a benchmark employer), the Employer Brand
simultaneously embodies the Group’s values and all its policies of
integration and HR diversity.

In 2014, the Group made responsible innovation a powerful lever to
attract the talent it needs to support its development, especially for
priority targets like engineers, young and experienced technicians,
women and candidates with international experience.

Many actions are thus being deployed in France, Belgium and across
the world to make the employer promise tangible. For example:

m= the Studyka Challenge: 500 students of 50 nationalities had three
months to present an innovative project promoting the Group's
corporate social responsibility. Indian students won first prize;

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

m the deployment of a comprehensive digital ecosystem, utilizing
complementary channels, to optimize the candidate relationship
and promote interactivity: web, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
Instagram, Pinterest, Linkedin, Viadeo and a careers app;

™ around 50 forums, all targeted to the recruitment needs of the
BUs and subsidiaries.

3.2.1.2 “Mobility for Development”

With around 5,500 transfers carried out in 2014, GDF SUEZ’s
mobility policy aims to reconcile the needs of both the business and
employees, by:

™ encouraging attraction, commitment and retention of employees;

m= optimizing the match between internal expertise and the needs of
the business units;

m= enhancing cultural integration, cooperation and promoting diversity;

™ contributing to developing employability;

™ encouraging knowledge sharing and innovation development.

Five principles were established in 2014 to increase mobility at

functional and geographical level:

= a fluid internal employment market;

™ avoiding talent-ownership conducts thanks to transparency and
HR rules of good conducts;

= priority to Group employees;

= right to confidentiality;

= disclosure and security of intercompany transfers.

Tools have been devised to promote mobility. Since April 2014,

employees have been able to see internal job offers and apply for

them from a website accessible to everyone, including those who

do not have access to the Intranet at their place of work. A “mobility

console” has also been developed to promote dialogue between HR

departments.

3.2.13 “Learning for Development”

In 2014, the Group confirmed the importance given to employee
training and employability with a learning policy. The Group
implements several training channels for all its employees:

m GDF SUEZ University for 30,000 executives, high-potential
managerial staff and managers: GDF SUEZ University extended
its offering in 2014, supporting the Group’s geographical
expansion by hosting nearly 6,800 participants from 42 countries
for 160 learning sessions;

min France, the “SynerFORM” tool facilitates the most
cost-effective access to external training programs in various
fields (general skills, office/IT, health & safety and languages).
Some 7,800 employees took part in 992 sessions in 2014 (which
is twice as many employees as in 2013);

m e-learning is available to all Group employees online via the
“e-campus” platform;

= consistent leadership of the Group’s learning channel enables
best practices to be exchanged and new apprenticeship methods
developed in the Group.

3.2.14 Targeted development policies

“Senior Executives’/“Experts"/"Coaching and

Mentoring"/“Development Centers”

To offer appropriate career development tools to senior managers,

experts and managers, GDF SUEZ deploys targeted policies

through:

= steadily increasing use of coaching and mentoring;

m= personalized career development support for senior managers;

m= development of “Experts”, aiming to promote them and enhance
their progress, rewarding them with Human Capital trophies;

m development of the Project Management functional line;

m deployment of “Development Centers”,

personal awareness tools.
It is worth noting that, at the end of 2014, there were 616 senior
managers, 16.9% of whom were women (compared with 13.2% at

development and

the end of 2012). 33% of new managers appointed since the
beginning of the year are women.

“Development for Functional Lines”

The functional lines wanted to set up an HR initiative for the
challenges of skills development. The Group Human Resources
Department (HRD) helps the management of each functional line
and its HR coordinator to set up practical initiatives, such as
mapping key positions and organizing key-manager appraisals.

This approach, which was initiated by the Finance functional line,
has been in place for two years in the Legal, Purchasing, Health &
Safety, Communications, Information Systems, Audit and Human
Resources functional lines.

“Leaders for Tomorrow” (“LFT")

The aim of the LFT program is to anticipate the needs of the Group
by attracting, retaining and training staff with management potential.

Of 33,000 managers, including 600 senior executives, 2,400 LFTs
can potentially be regarded as managers of the future, 27.6% of
whom are women. This pool produces 80% of new managers on
average.

Cross-functional communities and HR innovators

The HRD has also encouraged the inclusion of HR projects in
submissions to the Group Innovation Trophies. These projects were
included in the HR Innovations Yearbook for 2014, illustrating HR's
ambition.

The Group’s 13 HR networks (7 in France), which bring together
more than 200 HR managers, facilitate job grouping exchanges,
coordinate the smooth deployment of Group HR policies, the
GDF SUEZ Management Way and the social foundation project,
and efficiently pass on issues relating to jobs and mobility,
particularly through the Committee for Management and Planning of
Jobs and Skills, thereby implementing the European Agreement of
2010.

3.2.2 Social commitment: building a company committed to corporate citizenship,

diversity and solidarity”

The Group has been implementing a global, voluntary and ambitious corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy for many years. The policy

combats discrimination and promotes equal opportunities.

A social foundation project was defined at the time of the extension
of the global agreement on fundamental rights, social dialogue and
sustainable development, which was signed on November 16, 2010.
with several international trade union federations. The project is
based on four commitments by the GDF SUEZ Group: to be a
company committed to corporate citizenship, solidarity and
education, rooted in the regions.

These commitments are demonstrated in the policies and actions
implemented by GDF SUEZ in the area of corporate social
responsibility.

The Diversity Label

Audited in January 2014 for the second time since 2012 by the
French standards body (Association frangaise de normalisation —
Afnor), in May 2014 GDF SUEZ obtained confirmation of the
Diversity Label recognizing and proving the worth of the actions it
has embarked on and carried out in terms of preventing
discrimination, equal opportunities and promotion of diversity. This
label now covers all the Group’s production and services activities in
France.

GDF SUEZ SA and the Energy Services business line had already
obtained this label in 2012.

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION, CORPORATE SOCIAL COMMITMENTS

GDF SUEZ also pursued efforts to raise diversity awareness among
managers, in the HR functional line and among employees. When
the diversity label was awarded, an information campaign was.
launched about all the Group’s production and services activities.

GDF SUEZ has been a partner to the Management and Diversity
Chair at Paris-Dauphine University since 2009. The Chair’s activities
are based around three main objectives: “developing research”,
“teaching, training and raising awareness about diversity issues”
and “circulating and divulging the associated knowledge”.

Professional and gender equality

On April 9, 2013, the Group signed a framework agreement with the
Minister for Women’s Rights to support SMEs in the regions to
develop professional gender equality. In 2014, contacts were
established with SMEs in the French southwest. Similar issues were
identified, so-called male jobs were made more appealing to women
and so-called female jobs more attractive to men. A guide for SMEs
was published and a copy was sent to the chief executive of
CGPME in Toulouse. A new partnership with an architectural firm in
Toulouse is expected to start in early 2015.

As a reminder, the aim of the European agreement on
professional equality between women and men, signed in
June 2012 (see Section 3.2.3), is to promote equal opportunities
and treatment in practice throughout all the Group’s entities, in
order to change management and trade union culture and to
promote diversity. The agreement takes account of the targets set
by GDF SUEZ for 2015, i.e.:

m™ one-third of newly appointed executives will be women;
™ 35% of high-potential managers (LFTs) will be women;
wm 25% of women in managerial staff;

= 30% of new hires will be women.

The WIN (Women in Networking) network has more than
1,200 members and offers regular dialogue and group reflection on
professional challenges and Group strategy. The network is now
active in five countries.

In order to improve women’s access to technical and engineering
professions, the Group became a partner of “Elles bougent”
(‘Women on the move’) in January 2014; and a network of Group
mentors is working for professional gender equality.

The Group has also defined a parenting policy aimed at helping
reconcile work life with family life. Since 2011 when the T Babies
daycare center at GDF SUEZ head office was opened, the Group
has made childcare facilities available at various business lines and
BUs throughout the network. At the end of 2014, around 200 spots
for daycare in the Paris area and provincial regions of France were
reserved for children of GDF SUEZ “parent-employees”.

Young employees, seniors and intergenerational
policy

In September 2013, GDF SUEZ and two trade union federations
signed a “Generation Contract” agreement. Under this agreement,
the Group has undertaken to recruit 8,000 young people under
35 years of age on permanent contracts in France by 2015,
including 3,000 under 25 years of age. It also aims to achieve a 5%
proportion of trainees within the total workforce, and to recruit 50%
of these at the end of their training. The Group has publicized its aim
of maintaining senior employees in work with a target of 13% of
over 55’s in the total workforce by the end of 2015. Special

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

3.2 SOCIAL INFORMATION

attention has been paid to increasing the levels of training for
employees over the age of 50 in order to promote the transfer of
know-how and skills by managing the end-of-career phase and
encouraging training among the youngest employees. The
agreement creates a new system for over-55s preparing for
retirement, who will train the youngest employees.

Since 2006, GDF SUEZ has supported talented students from
disadvantaged backgrounds through sponsorship and grants. More
than 50 Group employees have volunteered to be involved in this
process and over 100 young people have been supported so far
(college leaving age or earlier). Sponsorship strengthens links with
the educational world and contributes to the Group’s policy of equal
opportunities.

Employees with disabilities

In France, each of GDF SUEZ’s business lines, subsidiaries and
entities rolls out the Group's disability policy, taking account of its
specific operational and local considerations. Currently, 11 collective
agreements approved by “Direccte” (Direction Régionale des
Entreprises, de la Concurrence, de la Consommation, du Travail et
de l’Emploi) cover almost 95% of the Group’s workforce in France.
The business lines and subsidiaries conduct actions to encourage
the hiring, career development and training of people with
disabilities and to raise awareness of disability issues. In 2009, the
Group set up a Disabilities Group network in France to promote the
sharing of positive experiences, skill-building within business
initiatives for people with disabilities, synergies between entities and
the implementation of joint actions. In 2012, the Group set up an
ongoing reporting process for the consolidation of all mandatory
reporting (Déclaration Obligatoire d’Emploi de Travailleurs
Handicapés - DOETH). At the end of 2013, the Group posted an
employment rate in France of workers with a disability of 4.04%,
placing it above average for the private sector where the rate is
around 3%.

Two key actions were initiated in 2013 and continued in 2014. One
concerns the direct recruitment of candidates with a disability to
Group job offers, called “Handi Recrut’Heures GDF SUEZ”.
Following the first recruitment day held in 2013 when shortlisted
candidates with a disability met with GDF SUEZ recruitment officers,
three more days were held between April and May 2014 — two in
Paris and one in Lyon. At each half-day, 17 permanent jobs were
offered on a work/study basis and the recruitment rate was over
50%. At the end of 2013, the Group reported that it employed a
total of 2,381 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees at its entities
across France.

The other key action initiated by the Group’s disability network in
France concerns purchasing from the sheltered and adapted
employment sectors. Since 2011, this action has been identified as
a vital part of the Group’s employment record and by the end of
2015, it is envisaged that it will account for the 6% mandatory rate.
At the end of 2012, a three-year action plan called “Handy-Achat”
was established with the objective of promoting the Group's
responsible purchasing policy as widely as possible and raising the
awareness of every in-house buyer. Since the beginning of 2013,
the Group's HR and Purchasing Departments have been working
on an extranet site dedicated to purchasing from the sheltered and
adapted sectors, and each Group entity has defined an internal
promotion campaign on the ground to promote this resource as well
as generally raising the awareness of in-house staff. This initiative
has already paid off as between 2012 and 2013, the volume of

71

3.2 SOCIAL INFORMATION

purchases from ESAT (Etablissement de Services et d’aide par le
travail) and sheltered organizations increased by over 23% to
€10 million. This corresponds to the indirect employment of 369
FTE people with a disability.

In March 2013, GDF SUEZ renewed its partnership agreement with
the Belgian Paralympic Committee for three years. The partnership
aims to increase the employability of, and help into employment of
young athletes with physical disabilities at the Belgian subsidiaries in
the GDF SUEZ Group, enabling them to work to adjusted hours and
under adapted conditions while pursuing top-level athletic careers
(e.g. the Paralympic Games and World Championships). The
partnership agreement was signed by the Ministers of Sport, the
Secretary of State for Disabled People, the sporting leagues and the
GDF SUEZ Group.

In June 2014, a partnership was signed in Belgium with “Handisport
Francophone” to boost the professional integration of young people
playing 5-a-side soccer.

Integration and support in finding employment

The Group has signed a “businesses and communities” charter with
the French Ministry for Urban Affairs regarding the employability of
young people at a national and regional level. The Group’s chairman
also sent the French President 150 proposals to promote the
employment of young people and the entrepreneurial spirit.

Similarly, the Group is actively participating in several innovative
projects aimed at using sport as a lever and platform for social and
professional inclusion Approximately 100 young people from
disadvantaged communities were guided into the workforce and
apprenticeships upon completion of the 2013-2014 program.

Since 2013, FAPE GDF SUEZ (Fondation Agir Pour |’Emploi in the
GDF SUEZ Group), under the auspices of the Fondation de France,
has enabled the Group to strengthen its commitment to social and
professional integration for people in severe difficulty or in a situation
of exclusion. The Foundation’s resources come mainly from
donations by employees and retired staff of the Group with a 100%
matching contribution from their company. Thanks to the generosity
of the donors, €400,000 have been raised since 2013 to support
28 projects presented by the integration agencies.

3.2.3 Social relations

3.2.3.1 Employee representation in the Group

The representative bodies are places for consultation and
collaboration between management and employee representatives.

The European Works Council (EWC)

The EWC at GDF SUEZ was established under the agreement of
May 6, 2009, which was signed by all the European social partners,
and amended on July 23, 2013 to take account of the
deconsolidation of SUEZ Environnement.

With 40 members representing the Group’s 125,899 employees
throughout Europe, its purpose is to develop and strengthen
European social dialogue, ensure balanced representation between
the Group’s countries and main business activities, and develop
social dialogue within these activities. A secretariat with
13 members representing eight countries meets once every two
months.

In 2014, the EWC held five full-plenary meetings, the EWC
secretariat held 6 meetings and the working groups held ten
business or subject-based meetings.

French Group Works Council

An agreement signed on June 2, 2009 also launched the French
Group Works Council. This body represents more than
74,000 employees in France. Two meetings were held in 2014.

3.2.3.2 Collective bargaining agreements

At a global level, on May 13, 2014, an agreement on health and
safety reaffirmed the Group’s ambition with regard to the European
agreement signed in 2010.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

In Europe, negotiations on the quality of life at work led to an
agreement on November 27, 2014 on improving the quality of life at
work, proposing a method to analyze the situation and draw up.
progress plans according to each company’s needs and
environment.

In France, an agreement on the generation contract was signed in
2013 and is effective for 2013, 2014 and 2015, to promote access
to employment for young people, maintaining seniors in
employment and transferring skills between the generations.
Accordingly, in the period from January 2013 to the end of
June 2014, the generation contract has already enabled the
recruitment of nearly 3,900 young people on permanent contracts in
France, the reception and training of work-study recruits amounting
to around 4.4% of the workforce, the recruitment of over 50s to
permanent contracts in France to around 6.7% and maintenance of
over-55s in employment, representing around 12.9% of the
workforce in France.

In 2014, as in previous years, the application of different agreements
was followed by committees in charge of capitalizing on the
associated good practices.

3.2.3.3 Involvement in the International Social

Observatory

GDF SUEZ supports the International Social Observatory (ISO) and
its efforts on well-being at work, promoting human capital policies
and managers. In 2014, the ISO organized 10 public meetings on a
range of topics (development and human capital, management and
cooperation, CSR and the social contract, transformation of life at
work etc.) and a symposium in Chile on social accessibility for major
projects. It also established a delegation in China.

an equitable way, its chairman, who must be chosen from the
shareholder representatives, holds the casting vote.

ORS 2015

The sale of 75 million GDF SUEZ shares by the French government
to the private sector on June 24, 2014 entailed a government
obligation to offer shares to employees and former employees of
GDF SUEZ and its subsidiaries in which the issuer holds, directly or
indirectly, the majority of the equity, pursuant to the provisions of
Article 11 of Law No. 86-912 of August 6, 1986 on the terms of
privatizations, and Article 26 of Law No. 2004-803 of August 9,
2004 on public electricity and gas utilities and electric and gas
companies.

The operation, called “ORS 2015”, the terms of which were defined
by the Minister for the Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs on
December 23, 2014, has been implemented in nine countries and

comprises two formulae, both exposed to fluctuations in the
GDF SUEZ share:

= a formula under the Group Employee Savings Plan (internationally
the International Group Employee Savings Plan): this formula
comes with a matching contribution of twice the amount of bonus
shares as those offered under the Link 2014 Classic formula: for
the first 20 shares subscribed, one bonus share per share
subscribed, and for the next 80 shares subscribed, 1 bonus
share for 4 shares subscribed, or a matching contribution of up to
40 bonus shares per 100 shares subscribed (shares locked in for
a period of 5 years). For legal and tax reasons, the allocation of
additional bonus shares was carried out in different ways in
France and outside of France: Outside France, the shares are
allocated by GDF SUEZ under a bonus share plan approved by
the Board of Directors on December 10, 2014 pursuant to the
authorization given by the Combined General Shareholders’
Meeting of April 28, 2014 in its 21* resolution;
= a formula outside the savings plan: the proposed GDF SUEZ
shares being held directly in a bearer account (non-transferability
of shares for a period of 2 years). This formula does not include a
matching contribution.
The purchase period for ORS 2015 ran from December 30, 2014 to
January 20, 2015 and the purchase price was set at €19.53 per
share. The shares’ settlement and delivery date was February 27,
2015. A total of 18,235,294 GDF SUEZ shares were offered and
1,360,000 shares were subscribed by more than 22,000
subscribers (It should be noted that GDF SUEZ will not receive any
income from the sale of shares under the ORS 2015, as all the
gross proceeds from the sale will be paid to the government, the
selling shareholder).

3.2.6 Health and safety policy

3.2.6.1 Performance

After several years of continuous progress, performance in terms of
accidents to Group employees has continued to improve:
™ accidents at work:
- frequency rate of 4.1, below the defined target (FR < 4.4 by end
of 2014) and down 49% from 2008 (from 8 to 4.1) and down
7% from 2013,
- mortality rate of 0.9 (versus 2 in 2008 and 0 in 2013),
- severity rate of 0.20 down by 39% compared to 2008 (from
0.33 to 0.20) and by 9% compared to 2013;
= commuting accidents with a frequency index of 3.1 in 2014
(down from 5 in 2010 and 4 in 2018).
In the field of occupational health, the number of hours of
absenteeism for medical reason by employee a year is stable (63h)
and the number of new cases of professional diseases increases
from 133 in 2013 to 150 in 2014.

The number of work-related accidents among external providers
and temporary staff improved; 5 fatalities in 2014 compared with 11
in 2013.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

3.26.2 Targets and progress

The progress targets for the period 2010-2015 have been set. They
relate to reducing occupational accidents as follows: (i) an accident
frequency rate of less than4 in 2015 and (ii) eradicating fatal
accidents with a causal link to the Group’s activities.

The Health and Safety Action Plan for 2010-2015 was completed in
2012 with a specific plan to eradicate fatal accidents. Its
deployment was continued in 2014.

These areas of progress and their impact on the Group's
occupational and industrial health and safety performance are
monitored by the Board of Directors, the Ethics, Environment and
Sustainable Development Committee, the Executive Committee and
the Health and Safety Steering Committee (which includes
employee representatives). They are reported via a quarterly email
from the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to senior
management, via various means within the Health & Safety and HR
functional lines and on the Group intranet.

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION, CORPORATE SOCIAL COMMITMENTS

The management mechanism

The key principles of the Group’s health and safety policy are set
out in Group agreements signed by the Chairman and Chief
Executive, employee representatives and trade unions around the
world (European agreement on occupational health and safety
signed in Paris on February 23, 2010 and a global agreement on
occupational health and safety signed on May 13, 2014 in Santiago,
Chile).

The Group’s Health and Safety Regulations set out the minimum
requirements at a global level for all entities. The repository is
supplemented by the “life-saving rules

In 2014, managers were provided with a guide that reiterates the
main managerial levers from the perspective of practical actions to
improve managerial practices (team meetings, engagement, visits
on the ground, recognition etc.). These are essential for compliance
with the Lifesaving Rules and thus contribute to transforming the
Group’s overall health and safety culture.

In line with the ERM process, the level of control of health and safety
risks was evaluated by line managers and by the Group Health and
Safety Department. The INCOME mechanism provides a framework
for the internal audits carried out by the line managers on the control
of industrial risks.

The deployment of these principles and health and_ safety
requirements is verified by means of internal audits and controls
performed by the Group Health and Safety Department. Around 30
checks were carried out in 2014 with a particular focus on
sub-contracting, the quality of managerial safety visits and the
application of the Lifesaving Rules. These checks showed that the
Managerial Safety Visits approach had become the norm and
represents an important lever for progress in reducing accidents.

In addition to these measures, the Group places great emphasis on
benchmarks and feedback as vectors for improving performance.

Management reviews performed by the health and_ safety
department at all levels (central office, business lines, BUs) evaluate
the results and set targets to improve the effectiveness of the
management system. Specifically, these reviews are intended to
assess the effectiveness of initiatives implemented as part of the
plan to eliminate fatal accidents and to develop action plans to
achieve its targets.

Finally, at least 10% of the performance-related pay of line
managers and the health and safety functional line is based on their
performance and commitment to improving occupational health and
safety.

Training

Training efforts continued in 2014: 28.5% of the total number of
training hours delivered were devoted to quality, safety and the
environment, and nearly 1,100 managers had Group training in
health and safety leadership at GDF SUEZ University.

3.2 SOCIAL INFORMATION

Raising awareness and sharing practices

Reflex, the in-house health and safety magazine (168,000 copies
published in eight languages), which describes good habits and
attitudes to be adopted in everyday life, is one of a number of
mechanisms used to strengthen the health and safety culture of
each Group employee.

These are backed up by the Group’s health and safety intranet and
two websites giving everyone access to a library of documents
encouraging the sharing of solutions and field experiences:

m™ the “zero fatal accidents” action plan website;

m the AGORA website containing managerial guides and practices
based on internal and external benchmarks.

The Group promotes the work of experts in networks to share

practical solutions, through the intranet, expert clubs and

professional communities of practices, the quarterly newsletter,

Prevention News, and the marketplace during annual internal health

and safety functional line conventions.

Launched in April at the world occupational health and safety day,
and promoted at the European health and safety week, the Group’s
2014 health and safety annual awareness campaign focused on
prevention of musculo-skeletal disorders (“MSD”). A series of
presentations, conferences and workshops were held to enable
employees to think about their work space, learn about good
handling methods and put into practice advice and stretching
exercises.

3.2.6.3 Dialogue with social partners

In 2014, dialogue with employee representatives and trade unions,
backed by a Group collective agreement on fundamental health and
safety principles, continued at the local level, the Group level, and in
each activity. The Health and Safety Steering Committee monitored
the Group’s results, analyzed the causes of serious accidents and
the preventive measures put in place, and gave its opinion on
proposed changes in the Group’s standards. Monitoring
committees for the various collective agreements signed at the
Group level in France met in 2014 to review the implementation of
these commitments.

Two new Group collective agreements were signed in 2014. They
reflect the determination to continue making progress and
strengthen the health and safety commitments made over a number
of years at the European level:

m the global health and safety agreement signed in May 2014 by
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the World
Federation of Trade Unions;

™ an agreement on improving the quality of life at work, signed in
November 2014 by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and
the European Federation of Trade Unions (see Section 3.2.3.2).

(1) These are practical rules which, had they been followed, could have avoided some of the fatalities in the Group in recent years.

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION, CORPORATE SOCIAL COMMITMENTS

3.2 SOCIAL INFORMATION

3.2.7.1 Note on methodology of social indicators

1 Tool

The social indicators are derived from Group social reporting (GSR).
They are set out in a shared Group referential (which can be viewed
on request).

The collection, processing and reporting of data entered by the local
legal entities, subsidiaries of the GDF SUEZ Group, is carried out in
Magnitude financial consolidation application, in accordance with
the IFRS financial scope.

The indicators published in this report relate to fully consolidated
companies, whose capital and management are under the control
of GDF SUEZ.

The social indicators are completely integrated, regardless of the
percentage of the company’s capital owned.

2 Scope of reporting

A reporting percentage is attached to each indicator, according to
the workforce covered. Some missing or inconsistent data are
omitted from the report.

Two sizeable entities that were recently acquired were excluded
from the scope of reporting of indicators relating to training and
compensation, as GDF SUEZ’s reporting methods are being rolled
out progressively.

3 Consolidation methods

The indicators for this report are consolidated using clearly defined
procedures and criteria.

Structural data, employee turnover, working conditions, training and
safety data were consolidated by aggregation.

4 Internal control

The social data are successively consolidated and controlled by
each operational entity and by each business line, before reaching
the Group HRD level.

5 Grenelle 2 Law

Social information pursuant to Article R. 225-105 of the French
Commercial Code can be found in chapters 3.1 and 3.2, and a
correspondence table showing the sections of this Registration
Document is provided in Appendix B. The table of indicators also
refers to the information required by the implementation decree.

6 Additional information on some indicators

a) Employment

The GDF SUEZ Group data include data from the six business lines
and Corporate data (including 3,339, 3,247 and 3,427 employees in
2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively).

As of July 2013, the Environment business line was no longer
included within the scope of consolidation as a fully consolidated
entity; its workforce was 79,421 and it had contributed to
7,022 hires and 1,665 employee transfers in the first half of 2013,
i.e. a total for the Group with BE of 22,810 hires and 7,134 transfers
in 2013.

The 2012 data were recalculated without the Environment business
line for comparison purposes.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

m= The geographical areas correspond to those integrated under the
scope IFRS. Although the companies in the Global Gas & LNG
business line are located in Africa, they are considered part of
Europe.

m Administrative employees
technicians and supervisors”.

m= The French concept of cadres (managerial staff) is sometimes
difficult to understand in other countries. This can lead to a slight
underestimation of the number of managerial staff because some
entities may take only their senior management into account.

are recognized under “senior

b) Staff changes

All indicators in this section are calculated on a constant structure
basis, i.e. the fully consolidated reporting entities included in the
scope of consolidation at 12/31/N-1 and at 12/31/N.

The lay-offs indicator does not include contractual terminations.

c) Diversity and equal opportunity

The declared percentage of people with disabilities provides the
best possible information on the inclusion of people with disabilities
into GDF SUEZ companies. We do not consider it relevant to
provide a scope definition for this indicator, since some entities are
unable to gather information due to local regulatory restrictions.

d) Career development
The training indicators provided in this document do not take
e-learning into account.

When all data cannot be provided within the timelines, the most
recent are provided as well as a forecast of the missing data for
year-end.

e) Organization of working time

The working hours of personnel within the Group companies are
organized within the legal framework for working time, which varies
from country to country.

Days of absence per person are calculated according to the Group
convention of eight hours of work per day.

f) Compensation

Group policy is to offer compensation to all that is personalized, fair
and competitive on the market, and which reflects the performance
and level of responsibility of each person:

m The compensation indicator is the ratio of the gross average
salary in the “manual workers, clerical staff and technicians”
category as a proportion of the national legal minimum wage.
This ratio enables assessment of the relative average national
salaries of full-time manual workers, clerical staff and technicians.

m The average gross salary is obtained by dividing the annual gross
salary by the average monthly full-time equivalent (FTE)
workforce.

m The restitution rate mainly depends on the existence and

3.2.7.2 Note on methodology
of health and safety indicators

Scope

Only the fully consolidated entities are covered by the analyses in
this document.

Methods for checking and consolidating indicators

After being collected, the quantitative health and safety data in this
report were checked and consolidated according to clearly defined
procedures and criteria.

3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

For the Infrastructure business line, in consolidating the data for the
GrDF distribution BU, which operates jointly with ErDF, only the
“natural gas” part of hours worked is taken into account.

The practices of public authorities and regulations on
communicating incidences of occupational illness within companies
vary according to the country concerned (for example Belgium,
where only some of this information is available). This gives rise to
differences in the way such data are computed by the Group’s
entities. The effort to raise awareness among Group's entities was
reinforced since 2013 to standardize the published data.

3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

GDF SUEZ faces the main environmental challenges: climate
change, the quality and availability of natural resources — air, water,
soil and energy, and the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems.
Although GDF SUEZ’s activities may generate improvements in
environmental quality, they also have an impact on ecosystems and
natural resources which the Group seeks to measure and reduce
within a process of environmental management of its activities.

GDF SUEZ’s challenges and ambitions in this area are reflected in
the Group’s. environmental policy (page 16
http://www.gdfsuez.com/analystes-rse/politique) and in the
performance indicators deployed across all its activities. A corporate
team, in charge of analysis and coordination, is specifically
dedicated to environmental responsibility and reports to the Director
of Environment. The team has environmental coordinators at each

business line who oversee environmental reporting, lead their own
networks of coordinators, organize actions, and supplement
corporate expertise with their knowledge of operations.

In addition, the Environmental and Social Responsibility Department
produces an annual report, which it sends to the Management
Committee and presents to the Board of Directors’ Ethics,
Environment and Sustainable Development Committee. This report
is supplemented by business lines’ own reports and letters of
environmental compliance, as well as the results of environmental
audits ordered by the Management Committee.

This framework provides a relevant assessment of the Group's
environmental performance and helps to identify areas of
improvement for the development of action plans, where needed.

3.3.1 Legal and regulatory framework

The Group actively monitors regulatory developments (set out in
Chapter 2, “Risk Factors”), stating its positions while they are being
prepared and applying the new rules as soon as they are published.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

In particular, the Group has been calling for the harmonization of
international regulations and greater integration between the various
environmental and energy policies.

3.3.2 The environmental management system”

At the end of 2014, the entities that had published an environmental
commitment policy or declaration accounted for 98.04% of relevant

externally certified, when justified. At December 31, 2014, 71.1% of
relevant revenue was covered by certified EMS (ISO 14001

When the implementation of a certified or registered management
system is not economically justified, entities are encouraged to
define an internal management system ensuring concern for the
environment in carrying out their activities. Thus, some Group
entities have deemed it more advisable to devise their own
management system standard, adapting it to their activities and
recognizing it internally. To supplement its Environmental
Management Systems (EMS), GDFSUEZ uses a dynamic
self-assessment system to evaluate the maturity of environmental
assessment processes, which allows operating sites to easily

identify areas for improvement and evaluate the adequacy of their
EMS for local circumstances and to assess their relative progress.
This system also enables them to monitor their progress and make
comparative analyses with other Group sites, whether or not they
are in the same field of activity.

It should be noted that the implementation of internal and external
EMS is accompanied by education and training sessions related to
the environmental issues that the targeted employees encounter in
their activities.

3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

3.3.3. Environmental responsibility, performance control

and measurement systems

To monitor the implementation of its environmental policy, to control
environmental risks and to encourage the communication of its
environmental performance to stakeholders, GDF SUEZ has
developed a specific reporting system that goes beyond the
requirements of the French law, based on work conducted within
international bodies such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

Environmental reporting is closely tied to operational performance
reporting, thus becoming a management tool. The Group’s
Executive Management transmits this goal of making environmental
concerns an integral part of management responsibilities. Auditors
trained in the Business Units and corporate auditors perform
environmental audits to ensure that environmental regulations are
Observed in the field and to evaluate major environmental risks.

A system of letters for environmental compliance ensures
operational management involvement: by committing management
to provide qualitative information that is consistent with the
standards of reference, controlled, verified and approved.

Methodological elements of the 2014
environmental reporting

GDF SUEZ conducts its environmental reporting using a dedicated
tool that allows data to be reported following a defined
methodology. This tool, called CERIS, is an environmental reporting
IT solution used to manage the network of environmental
correspondents and coordinators; to handle the management and
documentation of the scope of environmental reporting; to manage
data entry, monitoring and consolidation of indicators; and to
provide the documentation necessary for producing and collecting
data (reporting procedures and instructions).

CERIS is deployed in each of the business lines and thus covers the
entire GDF SUEZ organization.

The legal entities included in the reporting scope are those whose
operations are relevant in terms of environmental impact and that
are consolidated fully or proportionately under the rules of financial
consolidation (IFRS). Legal entities solely engaged in energy trading,
financial activities or engineering are excluded. The selected entities
report on the performance and impacts of the industrial facilities
over which they have technical operational control, including
facilities operated on behalf of third parties. Legal entities
consolidated at equity are excluded.

Thus, in accordance with the rules of financial consolidation, 100%
of the impact data collected is consolidated when the entities are
fully consolidated. For entities proportionately consolidated, the
environmental impact data are consolidated in proportion to the
Group’s consolidation rate provided that it has 100% technical
operational control or that as a minimum this is shared with other
shareholders.

The scope is determined on June 30 of the fiscal year. For disposals
after that date, the entity is expected to complete the environmental
questionnaire with the data available on the last day of the month
prior to the disposal. Acquisitions made after June 30 are not taken

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

into account, unless the business line has requested an exception,
and provided that the data are available.

To calculate environmental management indicators such as the
“part of relevant revenue covered by an environmental certification,
an environmental crisis management plan, etc.”, the relevant
revenue is estimated for each legal entity. To obtain the relevant
revenue, operations regarded as not “relevant in terms of
environmental impact” (e.g. trading, finance and engineering) are
stripped out of the consolidated revenue figure of each legal entity.

The procedures of environmental data reporting encompass general
procedures defined as standard guidelines to be implemented at
the appropriate levels of the reporting process. Procedures and
guidelines are rolled out Group-wide via a network of duly mandated
contacts and coordinators. These procedures and guidelines at
Group and business line level describe in detail the environmental
data collection, control, consolidation, validation and transmission
phases at different levels of the organization, as well as the rules for
defining the scope of consolidation. They include technical
documents that provide methodological guidelines for the
calculating of some specific indicators. Depending on its activities,
each entity is assigned a profile that determines the indicators to
answer. The list of the entities included in the environmental
reporting scope is approved by each business line.

The definitions of the indicators used to measure the environmental
performance of Group businesses have been revised based on
comments made by the statutory auditors. They also take into
account the comments by line managers represented in dedicated
work groups. All the documentation is available from the Group
upon request (Environmental and Societal Responsibility Division).

The following points should be noted with regard to the data
published in this report:

1. the reliability of the scope of environmental reporting is a
GDF SUEZ priority and it evolves in an international context of
business disposals and acquisitions. Before every reporting
campaign, the financial scope for consolidation is compared against
the information fed back by the business line’s environmental
managers in order to check which industrial entities contributing to
CERIS report to which financial entities;

2. for fiscal year 2014, to ensure delivery of all data required within
the stipulated deadlines, estimation methods were defined for data
that would not have been available in the 12 months of the
calendar year;

3. GDF SUEZ has been a signatory to the CEO Water Mandate
since 2007, thus indicating its commitment to preserving water
resources. In order to improve the Group’s water management, the
indicators relating to water were adjusted and brought into line with
the GRI indicators in 2011. GDF SUEZ is thus able to respond more
fully to external questionnaires: SAM, CDP Water Disclosure and
CEO Water Mandate, etc. These indicators fall into four categories:
Withdrawal, Discharge, Consumption and  Recycling/Reuse.
In 2014, clarifications were made to improve comprehension of
these indicators;

4. as it is concerned about what becomes of the waste generated
by its activities, the GDF SUEZ Group has indicators on its waste
recovery. These are based on definitions of waste and recovery
established by local regulations. To avoid erroneous data about
stocks, only the tonnages taken away and weighed on site are
reported as disposed of. The tonnages that must be reported are
wet or dry, depending on the way they are disposed of: if the waste
disposed of was wet, the reported tonnages are wet and the
converse for dry waste. As an exception, if the waste is definitively
stored on site, the associated dry tonnages must also be reported
as disposed of, in which case, the waste will not be recycled. For
example, this situation applies to the Hazelwood and Loyang B
plants in Australia;

5. CO, emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels were
calculated based on the most recent emission factors published by
the IPCC (4" Assessment Report - 2007). The global warming
potential (GWP) compares the warming capacity of the various
greenhouse gases to CO,. The GWP used to convert the Group’s
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to CO, equivalent are the
latest GWP published by the IPCC (5" Assessment Report - 2014),
considered on a 100-year scale;

6. the Biodiversity indicators used to monitor changes in the
Group’s objectives (see section 3.3.4.8) are based on the notion of
“priority site”. A priority site is one that presents a potential risk for
biodiversity due to the nature of its activities. It is located in or near a
protected area, and has no separation (natural or artificial break)
between it and the protected area. Subject to appropriate
justification, a site that does not meet these objective criteria still has
the option to declare itself a priority site;

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

7. specific GHG emissions from energy generation in kgCO,
eq/MWh are calculated for the three business lines where this is a
main activity: the Energy Services business line, the Energy
International business line and the Energy Europe business line;

8. data related to LNG vessels’ activity, including impacts and
consumption, have been incorporated as operating sites and are
therefore reported as such. The vessels included in the calculations.
are those in which GDF SUEZ has majority ownership, or those
operated by a subsidiary in which GDF SUEZ has a majority stake,
as well as long-term chartered vessels (> 1 year). This gives a list of
13 ships: Grace Cosmos, BW GDF SUEZ Everett, BW GDF SUEZ
Boston, Matthew, Provalys, GDF SUEZ Global Energy, Gaselys, BW
GDF SUEZ Paris, GDF SUEZ Neptune (SRV), GDF SUEZ Point
Fortin, Grace Acacia, Grace Barleria, and BW GDF SUEZ Brussels.
Any ISO 14001 certification of vessels is also taken into account;

9. for the sake of consistency, the factor for converting thermal
energy produced (GWhth) into electric power (GWhe) is set at 0.44
for all Group businesses and at 0.25 for incinerators;

10. significant environmental impacts resulting from subcontractors
during services performed at one of the Group’s facilities must be
included in the Group's impacts except when a specific contractual
clause provides that a subcontractor is liable for impacts generated
at the site while providing the service. Data provided by
subcontractors is not subject to systematic internal verification
before being included in Group data and is the responsibility of the
subcontractors alone. Regulations and legal obligations related to
the environment may differ from one country to another, and certain
data may thus be sometimes more difficult to gather (e.g. water
consumption in the United Kingdom).

3.3.4.1 Climate change

By developing a low carbon energy mix and through its energy efficiency activities the Group has put energy transition and the fight against
climate change at the heart of its strategic focus. It actively participates in the work of civil society in this area, contributing its operating
know-how in negotiations at all levels. This expertise is also available to the Group's customers through a range of commercial offerings,
whether for participation in the carbon market, technical solutions, support or implementation of strategies and action plans to reduce
greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. In addition, the Group responds annually to the Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire.

In 2014, the Group’s GHG emissions (Scope 1 excluding tertiary emissions) totaled 131 million tons of CO; equivalent”.

GDF SUEZ has set itself the target of a 10% reduction in its specific CO, equivalent emissions between 2012 and 2020. Compared to
443,1 g CO; eq/kWh in 2012, the emission rate at the end of 2014 was 434,2 g CO, eq/kWh.

GDF SUEZ has set up a working group to better assess the main risks related to climate change (increase in extreme events, availability of
water resources, etc.) and distributes an internal newsletter on adaptation to climate change in order to share information and best practices.
The Group is holding discussions on how it can implement the latest scientific advances, in particular through the European project “Extreme
Events for Energy Providers”.

In 2014, the Group conducted an initial evaluation of the impact of climate change (floods and drought) using Aqueduct software to
supplement its work on water stress (see Section 3.3.4.5 Water).

Three of GDF SUEZ’s business lines offer a very wide range of services: Energy Services, Energy Europe and Energy International. In
particular, Energy Services designs and implements energy efficiency and environmental solutions through multi-technical offerings in
engineering, installation and energy services. The other business lines also implement energy saving measures for their customers (e.g. in

France with the regulatory framework for Energy Savings Certificates).

For electricity generating facilities, energy performance is directly connected to the site’s efficiency which influences its profitability. It is
therefore a key action area for every power plant manager. Measures taken to improve power generation facilities have helped optimize

energy efficiency and hence consumption of raw materials.

Finally, in 2013 by signing the charter for energy efficiency of commercial buildings, GDF SUEZ reaffirmed its ongoing commitment to
controlling the energy consumption of buildings. Indeed, the Group has set up a green building policy to improve the environmental
performance of its commercial real estate, a policy whose first phase has been deployed in France and Belgium, with the objective, among

others, of reducing its energy consumption by 40% by 2020.

Maintaining a very high level of safety at the seven nuclear reactors operated by GDF SUEZ is a key priority for the Group. GDF SUEZ also
attaches great importance to limiting the environmental impact of these facilities (e.g. waste).

The downstream portion of the nuclear fuel cycle represents all operations related to this fuel after its use in a nuclear reactor. The costs for
this portion are and will be covered by total financial provisions of €4.496 billion at the end of 2014. Documentary evidence produced by the
company Synatom every three years is submitted to the Commission des Provisions Nucléaires for approval. The costs of dismantling nuclear
power plants after their closure have also been provisioned pursuant to current regulatory obligations. At the end of 2014, the provisions

8 Verified by the Auditors with “reasonable” assurance for 2014.

Accordingly, in January 2014, GDF SUEZ took the recommendations of an internal audit on waste management and incorporated them into
its environmental policy. Its chief aim was to reduce the quantities of waste it produces and to increase its rate of waste recovery.

These efforts have led to higher recovery rates for both non-hazardous waste (89.2% in 2014, up from 86.1% in 2013) and hazardous waste
(13.6% in 2014, up from 6.4% in 2013). The Group's industrial sites in France and abroad actively solicit local waste recovery solutions, even
though some of these channels remain dependent on market opportunities governed by the laws of supply and demand.

3.3.4.7 Atmospheric pollutants

GDF SUEZ uses a wide range of techniques to further reduce its emissions: reduction at the source using a tailored energy package; filters or
water injection to reduce particle emissions; installation of low-NOx burners or urea injection (secondary treatment) to control nitrogen oxides;
and choosing fuels with very low sulfur content to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.

3.3.4.8 Management of biodiversity

In order to contribute to the fight against the global erosion of biodiversity, remedy its impact under the three prongs of “prevent, reduce,
offset” and continue to benefit from eco-systemic services, the Group has been committed since 2010 to integrating biodiversity into its
various business lines. This commitment has resulted in particular in:

setting an objective for 2015 to assign a targeted biodiversity action plan to each priority site in Europe; “Targeted” action plans taken into
account in this objective are those where there is evidence that they are favorable to species/habitats that are protected or impacted by our
activities. Site priority is assessed based on the type of activities and the distance from protected natural areas;

a voluntary initiative officially recognized at the end of 2012 by the French ministry for the environment under the National Strategy for
Biodiversity.

In its approach to biodiversity, the Group relies on its partnerships: the French Committee of the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature (IUCN France) and France Nature Environnement (FNE). In 2014, the Group delivered a progress report on its long-term objective with
the support of IUCN to put its contribution to the French National Biodiversity Strategy into perspective. Between 2013 and 2014, the
proportion of sites deemed to be priority and having a targeted action plan increased from 35.6% to 72.4% at European level. In addition, the
Group has put in place an internal network of exchanges on biodiversity and is developing internal tools to facilitate understanding of the topic
and objectives by as wide an audience as possible. The differentiated management of green spaces, introduction of native plants, schemes
to enable migrating fish to pass through hydraulic structures, and the reduction of the impact of wind turbines on birds and bats are examples
of measures taken for the protection of biodiversity.

3.3.4.10 Nuisance

Any industrial activity is a source of noise. In order to reduce its
impact, Group entities conduct regular soundproofing work
(acoustic cladding, noise barriers, containment, and so on). In more
recent projects, reducing this potential form of nuisance is directly
integrated into the design.

For the most part, Group activities do not generate olfactory
nuisance. However, as natural gas is odorized for safety reasons,
some people may occasionally feel inconvenienced by the smell.

For its EnR projects, in particular onshore wind and solar PV, GDF
SUEZ conducts impact studies and proposes support measures to
prevent, reduce or offset any noise or visual impact. Examples of
such actions include defining and implementing turbine restrictions
(stoppage or reduced power at key times and/or under certain wind
conditions), conducting specific actions with builders to reduce the
sound power of machines, seeking better harmonization with the
landscape during the design and, after construction, initiating
planting and vegetation schemes on sites or for neighbors if there is
an obvious visual impact. By way of illustration, in France, GDF
SUEZ has partnered with the “Respect” project launched as part of
the offshore wind project at the city of Tréport and the islands of
Yeu and Noirmoutier. This project, in partnership with Quiet Oceans,
the University of Le Havre, the Langevin Institute, and the Pelagis
Observatory, is designed to improve understanding of the biological
impact related to the noise footprint of projects and reduce them by
developing appropriate technologies.

3.3.4.11 Land use

Protection of soil and groundwater is an integral part of the Group’s
environmental policy. The environmental consequences of soil
pollution can be significant, as can be the costs of subsequent
remedial measures. It is therefore important to prevent this risk and
to hedge it with financial provisions. These amounted to
€2.150 billion in 2014 and concerned sites rehabilitation, non
nuclear installations dismantling and scheduled programs for
eliminating products.

At Electrabel in Belgium, a soil survey was carried out at several
power plant sites and soil pollution was identified. Risks were
assessed in conjunction with the appropriate environmental
authorities and a remediation project is implemented wherever
necessary.

GDF SUEZ owns a number of former gasworks. These sites may be
affected by oil, heavy metals and other volatile substances that can
adversely affect health. As a result, they must be repaired before
reuse. In 1996, a 10-year plan was agreed via a memorandum
between Gaz de France and the French State for the rehabilitation
of these sites. As from 2007, all sites are compatible with their use
from a health perspective. Today, when these former sites are sold,
GDF SUEZ is committed to ensuring that the buyer’s project is
compatible with the environmental and industrial liabilities of the site
and that the risk to the environment and residents is effectively
managed.

3.4 SOCIETAL INFORMATION

At all its sites, the Group monitors the soil and underground water,
in accordance with its operating permits, in order to prevent
pollution.

The fragmentation of natural habitats, a consequence of land use,
represents the biggest threat to biodiversity and is at the root of the

3.4 SOCIETAL INFORMATION

great majority of land-use conflicts. Gas pipelines account for the
largest amount of land use by GDF SUEZ. As these gas routes are
buried underground, they do not fragment natural habitats.
Consequently, land use is not a key issue for the Group’s activities.

The responsible growth model developed by GDF SUEZ is based on professional dialogue with all stakeholders to encourage co-construction

and shared value creation.

3.4.1 Socioeconomic development in local communities

For GDF SUEZ, adapting its offerings to meeting its customers’
requirements and learning about them make innovation and
partnerships a central part of its local activities. These aims mean
that dialogue is the main foundation of the Group’s approach,
emphasizing the importance of a professional attitude on the part of
GDF SUEZ’s teams, who have a good knowledge of stakeholders
and a proactive, regular dialogue with them.

Internationally, in agreement with local authorities, the Group is
committed in the same way, as part of a professional and
participatory approach, to developing social programs linked to its
industrial projects and resulting from consultation.

GDF SUEZ supports small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and
start-ups through various programs implemented in local
communities. The Group also supports social entrepreneurship via
the GDF SUEZ Rassembleurs d’Energies initiative. This innovative
initiative was launched in 2011 to bring together and strengthen the
Group’s actions to encourage access to energy and basic services

in the countries where it currently operates or plans to operate in the
future. The GDF SUEZ Rassembleurs d’Energies initiative is based
on three pillars: donations, technical assistance and investment.

Since its creation, social investment fund GDF SUEZ Rassembleurs
d’Energies has made ten investments in France and abroad, for a
total amount of €4.1 million. In 2014 alone, the company invested
€3.0 million, in France (Les Toits de J'Espoir), Belgium
(LivingStones), Italy (GO LO Energia), India (Green Village Ventures,
Simpa Networks) and Uganda (Fenix).

To encourage the exchange of good internal practices in these
areas, the Group has established a best practices community with
regard to societal acceptability, which brings together the Group’s
leading practitioners. Its aim is to create a toolbox containing all the
methods that might be used throughout a project, from design to
assessment, and to make these available throughout the entire
Group.

3.4.2 Stakeholder dialogue and partnerships

GDF SUEZ maintains a continuous, proactive dialogue with all its
stakeholders concerning its industrial activities. Ensuring the
company’s sustainability and creating shared value, this culture
where listening and dialogue are paramount is also extended thanks.
to sustainable partnerships tackling social and environmental issues.

From 2015, this system will be enhanced by a dedicated
mechanism for consultation and dialogue with a group of
stakeholders representing the various areas of concern for the
Company. It will be coordinated by an independent institution
specializing in corporate-stakeholder relations.

Internationally, GDF SUEZ has been a member of the United
Nations Global Compact since 2001. Gérard Mestrallet chaired the
French Global Compact network for three years (2010-2013). To
share best practices in sustainable development, GDF SUEZ is a

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

member of a number of networks and associations, including the
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD),
and chairs, alongside ABB, Eskom and Schneider Electric, the
working group on “low-carbon electrification in isolated areas”.

In France, GDF SUEZ has concluded structural partnerships to
support its environmental efforts. Of note in this respect is its
partnership with France Nature Environnement, which brings
together 3,000 environmental protection associations that, since
2010, have supported the Group in its efforts to protect biodiversity.

To combat energy poverty, GDF SUEZ is a partner of Emmatis
France. A third framework agreement has been signed covering the
2013-2015 period to support Emmatis in its actions to combat
energy poverty.

3.4 SOCIETAL INFORMATION

3.4.3. Community philanthropy, solidarity and combating energy poverty

In all geographical regions where GDF SUEZ operates, initiatives
promoting community philanthropy, solidarity and combating energy
poverty are implemented by the GDF SUEZ Corporate Foundation
or Group entities, in connection with local authorities, local
associations, internal NGOs (Codegaz and Energy Assistance) or
the Group’s corporate functional departments. Since its creation in
2010, the GDF SUEZ Foundation has supported 32 projects as part
of its “Energy Solidarity” program, which is expected to help some
114,000 people in the longer term. GDF SUEZ has launched several
initiatives promoting solidarity and combating energy poverty.

In 2014, GDF SUEZ helped more than 824,000 customers receive
the Tarif Spécial de Solidarité (special solidarity rate), representing an
increase in volume of nearly 50% on 2013. In addition, and pursuant
to the decree of November 15, 2013, GDF SUEZ’s customers can
now benefit from the Tarif de Premiére Nécessité (basic needs rate)
for electricity without changing supplier. This decree also stipulates
the extension of the number of recipients of social rates, taking
baseline taxable income as the threshold for eligibility. GDF SUEZ
supported the public authorities, so that, as at the end of 2014,
more than 981,000 customers were eligible for these special rates
(824,000 for special solidarity rate and 157,000 for the basic needs
rate), for a total annual contribution of more than €57 million.

The Group also participates in the in Fonds de Solidarité Solidarity
Housing Fund (SHF), providing €6 million per year, in line with the
Public Service Agreement. In 2014, more than 93,500 customers of
the Group were benefiting from these council subsidies.

Since 2011, the Group has been acting alongside the public
authorities as a partner in the national “Live Better” program. Under

the new agreement signed in December 2014, GDF SUEZ has
renewed its commitment to the program, and will pay out
€53 million in the period 2014-2017 to renovate 185,000 homes.

GDF SUEZ has created a network of mediation partners with over
360 customer assistance centers throughout the country at the end
of 2014. Mediators at these associations, who are trained by
GDF SUEZ, talk to customers facing payment difficulties, help them
to understand their bills, give them advice on their energy spending,
and can help them to set up structured payment plans or direct
them towards social services to apply for assistance. In 2014, these
partners responded to more than 66,000 requests from
GDF SUEZ's customers.

GDF SUEZ has set up a dedicated structure for its customers in
vulnerable situations or those facing payment difficulties. Thirty-five
GDF SUEZ Energy Solidarity partners are in touch with local
communities, departments and associations and 170 GDF SUEZ
solidarity advisers are also dedicated to processing requests from
social workers.

The ISIGAZ (Information Sécurité Intérieure GAZ) program, which
informs and raises awareness among disadvantaged customers
about their domestic natural gas facilities and energy savings,
covered 24,000 homes in some 20 French towns in 2014. Since the
launch of ISIGAZ in 2006, 260,000 families in around 100 towns
have received this advice.

In 2009, GDF SUEZ set up an international observatory for energy
and water insecurity to enable the exchange of best practices
between its subsidiaries. The next observatory conference will take
place in 2015.

3.4.4 Purchases, subcontracting and suppliers

The Group’s Purchasing organization has defined four ambitious

objectives that contribute to the Group’s development and

reputation, over and above negotiations on price:

m™ to be a recognized contributor to the Group's operational
performance;

= to uphold the Group’s values in respect of its suppliers and to be
a key player in its CSR approach;

= to be a model for cross-functional initiatives within the Group;

m™ to drive career development.

The Group’s Purchasing and Procurement Policy defines the

Objectives and principles that govern how the Purchasing and

Procurement organization carries out its activities in interacting with

the line management internally and with the suppliers and

subcontractors’ market, in connection with its responsibilities, which

are outlined below:

m™ ensure that external supplies meet the requirements for quality
and economic performance;

™ uphold commitments and maintain balanced relations with suppliers;

m™ effectively manage the exchange of information using optimized

tools and processes. The implementation of PYRAMID, the
Group's Procurement solution, continued in 2014;

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

m professionalize staff and develop the expertise of the employees in
the Procurement network. The purchasing and procurement training
program, the “Procurement Passport”, was launched — in
January 2014. It aims to provide information about the challenges
that the Group faces and its strategy, and to give participants a
clearer understanding of the role played by Purchasing in the
Group’s necessary transformation. It raises awareness among all
actors in the Procurement network about the purchasing policy,
methods and processes, so that they can perform their duties more
effectively. The program is delivered in two ways: a two-day physical
seminar, and the online training program, the “Procurement
Passport”, accessed via the Group’s online training platform;

m= implement purchasing portfolio management by category in order
to develop the cross-functional nature of strategies within the
Group; 34 Category Managers were appointed in 2014 and
PYRAMID, the Group’s purchasing solution, was a concrete step
in this implementation;

= ensure that all agreements with suppliers are the subject of a
written document (that includes mandatory ethical, environmental
and social responsibility clauses) negotiated in advance and
signed between the parties by the approved buyer, pursuant to
the authorizations in force.

have used in exercising our professional judgment enable us to
express limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have
required more in-depth verifications. Due to the use of sampling
techniques and the other limits inherent to the operations of any
information and internal control system, the risk that a material
anomaly be identified in the CSR Information cannot be totally
eliminated.
