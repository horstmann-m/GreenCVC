2014 OBJECTIVES: SURPASSED; 2015 VISION: ACHIEVED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE;
PROSPECTS FOR VALUE CREATION: IMPROVED

GAMESA Corporacién Tecnoldgica’ regained sales growth in 2014 while steadily increasing
profitability, enhancing cash flow and strengthening its balance sheet. Commercial activity
firmed up, with 3,315 MW order intake, i.e. 58% more than in 2013, while the order book
totalled 2,494 MW at year-end, 38% more than at the end of 2013. Revenues in 2014 amounted
to €2,846 million, 22% more than in 2013, and EBIT totalled €191 million”, a 48% increase year-
on-year, while the EBIT margin was 6.7%’, over one percentage point higher than in 2013. At
constant exchange rates, revenues in 2014 expanded by 25% y/y, and the EBIT margin was
7.2%°, i.e. almost 2 percentage points higher than in 2013. In addition to improved profitability
and growth in sales, GAMESA continues to optimise working capital, which, combined with
focused capex, enabled it to reduce debt organically by 79% yly* and end the year with a net
cash position of €143 million, after increasing capital by approximately 10%.

Main consolidated figures for 2014
o Revenues: €2,846 million (+21.9% y/y)
o EBIT?: €191 million (+48.1% y/y)
o Net Income’: €101 million (2x y/y)
o Net cash on the balance sheet: €143 million (-0.4x EBITDA)
o MWe sold: 2,623 (+34.3% y/y)
o Firm order intake: 3,315 MW (+58% vs. 2013)

GAMESA Corporacién Tecnologica ended 2014 with revenues of €2,846 million, a 22%
increase over 2013, due to growth in the company's two areas of activity: wind turbine
manufacturing and O&M services. The Wind Turbine division obtained €2,411 million in revenues
in 2014, i.e. 22.3% more than in 2013, supported by strong growth in activity partially offset by the
depreciation of the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real, the change in the geographic and project mix
and, in particular, the recovery of sales in China, where the product scope is different”. Activity
volume amounted to 2,623 MWe, 34.3% more than in 2013 (1,953 MWe), due to the strong
contribution by the Indian and Brazilian markets to group sales, the recovery in the US and China,
and the contribution of emerging markets, such as the Philippines, Turkey and Sri Lanka. Growth in
those markets was offset by the lower contribution to sales by Europe and RoW, although they
improved in the second half of the year.

This increase in activity volume and revenues is in line with growth in global demand following
the decline in 2013. The recovery in demand, driven in large part by the US market, was also
supported by double-digit growth in emerging wind markets such as India, Brazil and Mexico;
GAMESA has a strong position in all three. The sound sales positioning, supported not only by a
diversified geographic presence but also by an extensive customer base and a portfolio of products
and services aimed at maximising the return on wind assets, and a presence throughout the wind
value chain enabled the company to sign orders for 1,148 MW’ in the fourth quarter of 2014 (30.8%
more than in Q4 2013), which raised total order intake in 2014 to 3,315 MW, 58% higher than in
2013 and twice the 2012 figure. As a result, GAMESA ended 2014 with an order book totalling
2,494 MW, 38.4% higher than at 2013 year-end, which covers 64%’ of the sales guidance for
2015 and enhances medium-term visibility of sales.

Of the four pillars upon which GAMESA has built its commercial strength, progress in technology
leadership during the last two years was one of the top factors quoted in the biannual customer
satisfaction survey. This leading position was corroborated by WindPower Monthly magazine, which
gave the G114-2.0 MW turbine the gold medal in the <2.9 MW category, the category that is most
hotly contested since it is where the bulk of demand is concentrated.

GAMESA's greater activity volume, supported by a leaner fixed cost structure than at the beginning of
the Business Plan 2013-2015, led to a material increase in operating profitability in 2014. Together
with rising volumes, the continuous optimisation of variable costs enabled the company to partly
offset the decline in the margin caused by the different project mix and the impact of the devaluation
of the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real. In this way, GAMESA accelerated the improvement in
profitability ratios throughout 2014, obtaining a recurring EBIT margin of 7.4% in the fourth quarter
of 2014, i.e. over 2 percentage point higher than in the same period of 2013, which represents 97%
year-on-year growth. As a result, EBIT amounted to €191 million in the full year,® with the EBIT
margin amounted to 6.7%, exceeding the guidance for 2014 (>6%). At constant exchange
rates, GAMESA obtained an EBIT margin of 7.2%’, i.e. almost 2 percentage points more than in
2013 (5.5%').

Solid growth in volume and O&M revenues combined with higher business profitability and the
decline in exchange losses and in losses from certain investees, partially offset by the increase in the
tax burden, resulted in GAMESA doubling net profit to €101 million in 2014.

During the year, GAMESA continued working to strengthen its financial position, reducing debt not
only by expanding sales and improving operating profitability but also through strict control of capital
expenditure in both property, plant and equipment and R&D, and of working capital. GAMESA
reduced working capital by 63% y/y in the context of rising activity (+34% y/y) and, and improved the
working capital/revenues ratio by 5.8 percentage points to 2.5% at the end of 2014. Profitable growth,
optimized working capital and focused capital expenditure (which declined slightly y/y to €109 million)
enables GAMESA to reduce debt in organic terms by 79% y/y.

Aside from organic debt reduction and with a commercial activity that positions the company for
higher volumes than those envisaged in the BP 13-15, in September 2014 GAMESA increased
capital by issuing 25,388,070 new shares, equivalent to c.10% of existing capital, in order to
prepare the balance sheet for the projected higher future activity. As a result, two years after the
2013-15 Business Plan was launched, GAMESA's net cash position at 2014 year-end
amounted to €143 million and its net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was -0.4x.

Activity

GAMESA sold 2,623 MW in 2014, 34% more in year-on-year terms. This growth was driven mainly
by India (whose contribution increased by 26%) and Brazil (+22%). Likewise, growth in countries
such as the US and China in 2014 (following the very small contribution in 2013) enabled GAMESA to
beat its volume guidance (2,200-2,400 MWe).

The Wind Turbine Division's activity during 2014 can be broken down as follows:
GAMESA continued to expand in emerging markets:

e Latin America+Southern Cone continues to be the region with the greatest
contribution to sales (34%), mainly because of Brazil and Mexico

e India accounted for 26% of total sales in the year, i.e. 4 percentage points higher than in
2013.

¢ Following the decline in activity in the US and China in 2013, they began to make a
notable contribution in 2014 (15% and 9%, respectively).

Profitability
Revenues amounted to €2,846 million in 2014, a 22% increase on 2013 (€2,336 million).
e Services revenues increased by 19%, to €435 million.

e Excluding services, sales expanded by 22% with respect to 2013, i.e. by less than the
increase in MWe (+34%), due to the decline in average revenue per MWe, which was
negatively impacted mainly by currency fluctuations, the higher exposure to China and India,
and the greater contribution by GAMESA Energia in 2013.

GAMESA obtained €191 million in recurring consolidated EBIT in 2014 and an EBIT margin of
6.7% (compared with €129 million and 5.5%, respectively, in 2013).

The trend in recurring EBIT performance in 2014 with respect to 2013 was attributable to:
e higher sales volumes (+2.3 percentage points),
e fixed cost performance (-0.1 p.p.),
¢ contribution margin performance (-0.5 p.p.)
* currency depreciation (-0.5 p.p.)

The Operation & Maintenance unit continues to steadily increase revenues (+19% y/y).
Additionally, this division has an EBIT margin of 12.7%, which is aligned with the double-digit target
set in the Business Plan 2013-2015.

Consolidated net profit in 2014 (€92 million) was impacted by a net financial loss excluding
income from equity accounted affiliates (-€46 million), taxes (-€38 million), and losses on
discontinued operations (-€5 million). The company also booked a loss of -€7.8 million on
Almodovar del Rio (booked under "Gains (losses) on disposal of non-current assets").

Balance sheet

GAMESA had €71 million in working capital at the end of 2014, i.e. 2.5% of revenues. This is a
significant decline (-€122 million) with respect to 2013 (€193 million, 8.3% of revenues) despite the
higher activity in the period.

GAMESA also continued to focus on strict control of capital expenditure, ensuring the return on
investment and a sound balance sheet. As a result, GAMESA's capital expenditure amounted to
€109 million”, in line with the guidance of < €110 million. In 2014, GAMESA focused capital
expenditure in 2014 on:

e R&D associated with new products and platforms (G114—2.0 MW and GAMESA 5.0 MW),
e adaptation of production capacity to the G114-2.0 MW and the GAMESA 5.0 MW

GAMESA ended the year with -€143 million in net interest-bearing debt (i.e. cash), i.e. less than
in 2013 (€420 million). That cash figure includes €232 million, net of expenses, from the capital
increase in the third quarter and c. €120 million from asset sales. Eliminating those effects, debt
halved in 2014, declining by -€210 million in absolute terms.

2. Forecasted evolution

Good outlook for future demand

Demand increased sharply in 2014 (+46%) following the decline in 2013 (-22%) and GAMESA,
together with the main consulting firms in the industry, project that growth will continue through 2015
year-end. This expansion is supported not only by the recovery in the US market but also by the
accelerating pace of installations in growing economies such as India, Brazil, Mexico and China, and
some European countries. The decline in onshore and offshore installations in Europa beyond 2015,
and the expected decline of the US market after 2016 if the production and investment tax credits are
not renewed explained the expected decline in global installations over the two year period, decline
that returns back to growth un 2018.

The Americas, China and emerging countries are the main growth drivers in the immediate
future

Projections for installations/connections to the grid in 2015 vary from 48GW" to 64GW. This volume
of installations worldwide will be driven by the recovery in the US market that commenced in 2014
and will run until 2016, as well as China and emerging markets, including notably Brazil, India
and Mexico. The latter four markets account for almost 50% of projected onshore installations
this year.

Emerging countries and China partially offset the stagnant onshore market in Europe and the
decline in the US market starting in 2017, in a scenario in which the production tax credits
(PTC) are not renewed

The extension of the PTC in the US at the end of 2014 made it possible to upgrade demand
projections for the markets for 2016 into line with those for 2015 (close to 8 GW), but uncertainty
persists beyond 2016. Unless production/investment tax credits are extended again, installation
volume in the US can be expected to fall by 50% in 2017. However, although several external
sources that estimate demand consider a scenario where PTC are not extended or are delayed, at
the moment there are no grounds for assuming either scenario.

Gamesa Vey ACTIVITY
se REPORT

In Europe, the onshore segment is expected to stagnate as from 2015 due to normalisation of the
pace of installations in Germany, following the acceleration in 2014 because of legislative changes,
and to the progressive adaptation of demand in several markets to new regulations enacted or to be
enacted in 2014-2015.

In this context of a slowdown in mature markets, growth continues in emerging countries, where
GAMESA has a solid position among the three largest markets: India, Brazil and Mexico. Additionally,
order entry has increased in China, a country which is expected to lead the pace of installations in the
short, medium and long term. The company's advantage in terms of geographic positioning plays an
important role in guaranteeing the sustainability of growth in volumes in the medium term.

The offshore market is expected to accelerate starting from 2017 onwards, coupled with a recovery in
the onshore market in Europe, which will be driven by constant improvements in wind's
competitiveness and a defined regulatory framework that puts an end to the uncertainties that have
plagued the last three years, making it possible to take investment decisions. In fact, wind's greater
competitiveness coupled with the new regulations governing energy in Europe will enable wind to
play a prominent role in the open auctions expected to begin in Europe after 2017.

The recovery and growth in Europe's mature markets in the medium and long term will combine with
steady growth in demand in emerging markets. This growth will be sustained by rising energy needs,
in emerging markets, which will account for 90% of global energy demand growth through 2030, as
set out in the International Energy Agency's 2013 World Energy Outlook, and by the need to reduce
dependency on fossil fuels and to diversify generation sources to ensure supply stability.

Enhanced regulatory visibility and the constant improvement in wind's
competitiveness will drive sustained demand growth over the medium and
long term.

Improved regulatory visibility is one of the levers that support demand growth, not only in the medium
and long term but also in the short term, where the extension of US tax credits for wind investment
and production is a key driver behind the surge in the pace of installations in 2014-2016.

During 2014, supra-national agreements were reached that reflect the importance of setting targets
for renewable power generation and greenhouse gas emission reductions, both of which are essential
to combat the effects of climate change. They include the European Union's 2030 framework for
climate and energy, the US-China bilateral agreement to control greenhouse gas emissions, and
COP 20.

e The European Union's 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy establishes three goals to be
chieved by 2030: a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions with respect to the 1990
aseline, renewable energy contributing 27% of electricity consumption, and 27% energy
ficiency. These overall targets at European Union level would be achieved by setting
dividual targets for the member states.

5 Qoo

e The agreement between the US and China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions sets
mutually agreed reduction targets for the first time. The US undertakes to reduce its
emissions by 26-28% with respect to the 2005 level by the year 2025. China is committed to
halting the growth in emissions by 2030 and to obtaining 20% of its primary energy from non-
fossil sources by 2030.

e The 20th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 20) continues working on an
agreement to replace the Kyoto protocol in 2020.

In addition to the supra-national agreements, regulatory progress has been made in Europe and the
United States. Europe continues with reforms to national energy markets following the approval of
new laws and procedures in Germany, Spain, Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Romania,
and the presentation of draft legislation in France and Poland. These reforms advance towards a

steady reduction in government aid, aligned with the rising competitiveness of renewable energies,
and towards the introduction of competitive auctions for projects commissioned from 2017 onwards,
thereby helping to reduce uncertainty and to create a situation that is more favourable to investment.

Regulatory progress in the main markets includes notably the establishment of more ambitious
renewable energy targets in Germany and France. Germany proposes that renewables’ contribution

to energy consumption should reach 45% in 2025 (previously 40%) and 60% in 2035 (previously
55%). In France, the proposed new law on the energy model sets targets for the year 2030, including
a 40% reduction in emissions with respect to the 1990 baseline, a 30% reduction in fossil fuel
consumption, and that renewable sources should cover 40% of energy consumption. The proposal
also envisages reducing the nuclear contribution to 50% in 2025, and a 50% reduction in total energy
consumption by 2050.

In connection with the regulatory situation and support for renewables, the US temporarily extended
(from 31 December 2013 to 31 December 2014) the subsidies for production and investment, and
maintained the classification of projects subject to “physical work of a significant nature" or
exceedance of the 5% threshold (safe harbour). Meanwhile, the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) published the Clean Power Plan to reduce CO2 emissions intensity to 30% below the 2005
baseline by the year 2030.

With regard to investment and installation targets, the plan for 2016-2020 being drafted in China
proposes an annual onshore installation target of 20 GW, the goal being to attain 200,000 MW by
2020. The target proposed for offshore is 10,000 MW by 2020.

In addition to regulatory developments in the mature economies growing economies such as
China, Brazil, Mexico and India continue working to reduce energy dependency while meeting
the rising demand for energy.

China is working on the new 2016-2020 Investment Plan that includes targets for onshore
installations of 20 GW/year to reach a cumulative base of 200.000 MW in 2020. In the offshore
segment the plan targets 10.000 MW in cumulative installations in 2020.

The new government in India has introduced major reforms that support investments in renewable
energies in general and wind in particular. Accelerated depreciation has been reinstated for
calculating the tax base for wind investments (up to 80% of the value in one year), tax holidays for
wind generation have been extended until March 2017 (100% tax credit for 10 years), a 15% tax
credit has been introduced for investment in manufacturing enterprises and it has been extended to
March 2017, while taxes on the import of components have been reduced.

In 2014, Brazil assigned nearly 2.3 GW of wind PPAs and has announced that the first two auctions
of 2015 will be held in April and June. Countries such as Chile, Guatemala, Peru and Egypt are also
considering capacity or production auctions.

In addition to regulatory progress and promotion of renewable sources within the energy mix, another
lever supporting demand growth in the medium and long term is the notable increase in wind power's
competitiveness, to the extent that it is now on a par with traditional sources in many countries, as
shown in the graphs.

GAMESA is participating in this effort to improve wind power's competitiveness. In the last two years,
the company has made significant progress in this direction with the launch of the G114-2MW in 2013
and the G114-2.5 MW and G106-2.5 MW for medium and high wind sites in 2014.

Both products are part of the 2.0-2.5 MW platform, of which GAMESA has installed more than 18,682
MW;; this platform is characterised by its robustness, high level of reliability and adaptability to all
types of sites and wind conditions, with an average fleet availability of over 98%.

The development of both products is in line with the objectives in the company's R&D programme: to
maximise value for clients, increase annual energy production and reduce the cost of energy. The
new products, based on sound proven technology, increase annual energy production by 30%
with respect to earlier comparable models (G90-2.0 MW and G97 2.0 MW) and reduce the
nominal cost of energy by 10%.

Continuous cost optimisation programmes in pursuit of competitiveness

While growth in global demand enabled GAMESA to recover sales growth in 2014 and project the
steady increase in 2015 and thereafter, the Company continues to pursue product costs
improvements built on top of an optimized fixed cost structure. Ongoing work on product design, the
supply chain and internal manufacturing processes improve the Company's competitiveness enabling
GAMESA to tap additional growth opportunities in 2014 and subsequent years, opportunities that rival
companies are unable to access on a competitive basis.

Among the measures in the 9/15 optimization programme, the process of manufacturing blades by
infusion has been fully implemented in India and Europe, enabling the company to achieve the
savings envisaged for 2015. In the area of product redesign, most of the improvements have been
made in the nacelle frame, elevator and crane and in the tower, and the projected savings are also
being achieved as a result. The supply base has also increased considerably, the "build to print"
model is already under way, and significant improvements have been achieved in conditions with the
traditional suppliers.

Improvements in
competitiveness
(Processes)

Working with suppliers

All these initiatives aimed at enhancing the company's competitiveness have made it possible to
offset the costs of the learning curve associated with the launch of the G114 2.0-2.5MW, the lower
relative contribution by operation and maintenance services (due to accelerating sales of wind turbine
generators), the lower penetration by multi- MW machines in Europe, and the entry in new markets.

The result is that GAMESA can continue to grow profitably.
Managing the balance sheet effectively

Since the plan was launched, the company has continued to optimise the cost structure while
effectively managing the balance sheet. It is precisely in this area that GAMESA obtained some of its
most notable results in the last two years, which it expects to maintain in the future.

In terms of capital expenditure, the company remains focused on optimising the cost of energy, where
it has achieved very notable improvements with the launch of the G114-2.0 MW, G114-2.5 MW and
G106-2.5 MW. Capex continues to be shaped by the potential and size of market opportunities. Along
these lines, capex in assets in 2015 will be focused on increasing internal and external capacity in
regions with the greatest growth, such as India and Brazil, and on developing new products that
follow in the footsteps of the G114-2,0 MW y G114-2,5 MW in terms of increasing energy production
and reducing costs. This focus will enable GAMESA to maintain an investment ratio in tangible
and intangible assets of less than 4% of revenues in 2015 and beyond. That ratio is almost one
percentage point less than expected in the 2015 vision under the 2013-15 business plan.

Additionally, €365 million in working capital has been released since the plan was rolled out in 2012,
in a context of rising activity. The company has monetised wind farm operational assets and
maintains strict control over investment in the development pipeline, focusing on those markets where
farm development is an indispensable asset for remaining a leader, as is the case in India and

Mexico. In terms of manufacturing, project management is being aligned with cash flow, and
manufacturing is being scheduled in line with receipts (manufacturing to cash). The combination of
both working capital management policies enabled the company to end 2014 with a working
capital/revenues ratio of 2.5%, and GAMESA expects to maintain the ratio below 5% in the future, i.e.
more than 67% lower than the ratio envisaged in the 2015 vision of the 2013-15 plan.

Value creation prospects in 2015

The combination of profitable growth, attributable to the strong competitive position, along with the
continuous optimisation of costs and effective management of the balance sheet allows GAMESA to
improve upon the value creation prospects set out in the 2013-2015 business plan. Growth in
business volume has increased by almost 30% in the new forecasts, while the profitability of
operations continues to improve. The working capital/revenues ratio continued to decline, and is
almost 70% lower, and the capital expenditure/revenues ratio is almost one percentage point lower
than set out in the plan's original vision. This will drive an improvement in value creation,
boosting the differential between ROCE and WACC from 2 to 4 percentage points.

Conclusions

In a context of recovering global demand and the improvement in GAMESA's competitive position,
the company ended 2014 above its targets for the year, having achieved the 2015 vision ahead
of schedule and improved value creation prospects for the current year, all attributable to sound
business management.

Financial performance in 2014 exceeded all the targets that had been set for the year.
Revenues amounted to €2,846 million, i.e. 22% higher than in 2013, and the EBIT margin was
6.7%"°, more than 1 percentage point higher year-on-year. At constant exchange rates",
GAMESA's revenues expanded by 25% year-on-year, while the EBIT margin was 7.2%.
Additionally, net profit doubled to €101 million.

One of the most prominent features of 2014 was the company's sound competitive position, with a
diversified geographical footprint and customer base, and a portfolio of products and services focused
on maximizing returns for our customers. This resulted in a surge in order intake to 3,315 MW, 1.6
times the 2013 figure and a five-year high. This enabled GAMESA to increase revenue visibility for
this year and 2016 since it ended 2014 with an order book of 2,494 MW, 38% more than at 2013
year-end and covering 64% of the guidance for 2015"°, i.e. 11 points more than coverage of 2014
sales at 2013 year-end.

Apart from expanding revenues and profitability, GAMESA continues to strengthen the
balance sheet organically, building on the improvements achieved in 2013. In a context of
increasing activity, GAMESA reduced working capital by 63% with respect to 2013, and improved the
working capital/revenues ratio by 5.8 percentage points in 2014. This reduction in working capital,
together with greater profitability and control of capex, enabled GAMESA to achieve €330 million
net cash flow in 2014, four times the 2013 figure, including €120 million in asset sales.

Together with the organic cash flow that enabled it to reduce net financial debt by 79%, and with the
goal of preparing the balance sheet to handle production volumes in excess of those initially
set out in the 2013-15 Business Plan, GAMESA increased capital in September by issuing 25.4
million shares (c. 10% of capital), with the result that it ended the year with a net cash position of
€143 million on the balance sheet, and improved its NFD/EBITDA ratio to -0.4x.

As a result, GAMESA is equipped to continue increasing production and profitability ratios in
2015 and subsequent years. It is ready for a future of profitable growth.
