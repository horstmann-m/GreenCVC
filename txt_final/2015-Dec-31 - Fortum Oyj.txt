Fortum's performance from continuing operations in 2015 was

not satisfactory. Profitability declined and remained depressed
throughout the year due to the very low electricity prices mainly
driven by extreme hydro conditions and low commodity prices.

The weak market in combination with an increasing cost burden,
especially the nuclear capacity tax increase in Sweden, forced
early closures of nuclear capacity. This led to extensive write-downs
that further burdened our results. Fortum’s total operating profit,
however, increased clearly due to the sale of the Swedish electricity
distribution business that completed the divestment of Distribution
started in 2013.

2015 demonstrated again that Finland and Europe are not
isolated islands unaffected by global economic cycles. The rapid
decline in commodity prices (coal, oil) and increase of subsidised
renewable production created an urgent need for the whole utility
industry to transform and improve the industry's competitiveness.

Fortum's balance sheet is strong. At the end of 2015, net debt
to EBITDA was -0.5 as Fortum was net cash positive by more than
EUR 2 billion. Net debt decreased by approximately EUR 6.5 billion
during 2015 as a result of the Distribution divestment. A strong
balance sheet and good profitability are important to Fortum - they
ensure flexible implementation of our strategy, create the capability
to carry out our investments and provide the readiness to seize new
opportunities as they arise.

In Russia, the multi-year investment programme is nearing
completion with the commissioning of two units in Chelyabinsk. The
first of the two was finalised in December 2015 and the last unit is
planned to be commissioned during the first quarter of 2016.

Given the demanding market, we are pleased at Fortum with
the continued positive development in the company's stakeholder
satisfaction last year. According to a survey the company
conducted, Fortum's reputation has improved and our investments
in sustainability have received recognition. We now have a good
base to continue building on. Our customers are - and will continue
to be - our key focus area. As a result, both our customer base in
electricity sales and heat has steadily increased.

Fortum's Distribution divestment completed

In June 2015, Fortum completed the divestment of its Swedish
electricity distribution business.

The total consideration was approximately SEK 60.6 billion on a
debt- and cash-free basis, corresponding to approximately EUR 6.4
billion. Fortum booked a one-time sales gain of approximately EUR
4.3 billion, corresponding to EUR 4.82 per share, in the second-
quarter 2015 results.

The transaction concluded the divestment of Fortum's
Distribution business, a process that began in 2013. The total
consideration from the divestments in Finland, Sweden and Norway
is approximately EUR 9.3 billion on a debt- and cash-free basis and
approximately EUR 6.2 billion in non-taxable sales gains booked
during 2014 and 2015.

IFRS restatement relating to discontinued
operations

After the divestment of the Swedish electricity distribution business,
Fortum has no electricity distribution operations. Therefore, as of
the first-quarter 2015 interim report, the Distribution segment has
been treated as discontinued operations, consistent with IFRS 5
“Non-current assets held for sale and Discontinued operations". The
income statement, including other comprehensive income, cash
flow statement and certain key ratios has been restated for the 2014
comparative period. In the segment information, the Distribution
segment is reclassified as discontinued operations.

Comparability of information presented in
tables and graphs

Financial results discussed in this operating and financial review

are for the continuing operations of Fortum Group. The Distribution
segment has been reclassified as discontinued operations. As

a result, continuing operations and discontinued operations are
presented separately for Fortum Group. Comparative period
information for 2014 has been restated accordingly and can be found
in the stock exchange release published on 15 April 2015. Information
in the tables and graphs presented for year 2013 or earlier is not

restated due to reclassification of discontinued operations. For
further information, see Note 1.2.1.

Furthermore, information in the tables and graphs presented for
year 2012 or earlier is not restated due to the adoption of IFRS 10
and IFRS 11. Adoption of standards influences treatment of Fortum’s
holding in AB Fortum Varme samagt med Stockholms stad in the
the consolidated financial statements.

In addition, as of 2014, presented figures have been rounded and
consequently the sum of individual figures may deviate from the
sum presented.

In 2015, sales were EUR 3,459 (4,088) million, the decrease was mainly due to weak power prices and the
Russian rouble. Comparable operating profit totalled EUR 808 (1,085) million and the reported operating
profit totalled EUR -150 (1,296) million. Fortum's operating profit for the period was affected by EUR -794.

information see Note 7), other impairments and provisions EUR -124 (0) million as well as non-recurring
items EUR 22 (305 million), an IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives mainly used for hedging
Fortum's power production and nuclear fund adjustments for continuing operations amounting to EUR

-62 (-94 million). Total Fortum’s operating profit EUR 4,245 (3,428) million includes the sales gain from the
divestment of the Swedish electricity distribution business, approximately EUR 4.3 billion (approximately
EUR 1.9 billion from Finnish and Norwegian operations in 2014).

The share of profit from associates was EUR 20 (146) million, the negative impact came mainly from
the write-down of Oskarshamn nuclear units 1 and 2, in Sweden. The impact on earnings per share from
the early closure of nuclear units O1 and O2 was EUR -o.82 per share. Fortum Varme represented EUR 47
(67) million, the decrease was mainly due to Fortum Varme’s compensation to Fortum related to early
prepayment of loans. The share of profit from Hafslund and TGC-1 are based on the companies' published
third-quarter 2015 interim reports.

The net financial expenses were EUR -175 (-210) million. Net financial expenses include changes in the
fair value of financial instruments of EUR -18 (-5) million.

Profit before taxes was EUR -305 (1,232) million.

Taxes for the period totalled EUR 78 (-143) million. Taxes for the period are positive as the group is in
loss position. This is mainly due to the write-down related to early closure of nuclear units O1 and O2 units
in Sweden. The tax rate according to the income statement was 25.4% (11.6%). The tax rate, excluding the
impact of the share of profit from associated companies, joint ventures as well as non-taxable capital
gains, was 23.5% (2014: 18.0%).

The profit for the period for continuing operations was EUR -228 (1,089) million. Earnings per share for
continuing operations were EUR -0.26 (1.22), of which EUR -0.97 (0.26) per share relates to items affecting
comparability, including total effect related to early closure of nuclear units O1 and Oz. Earnings per share
for total Fortum, including the effect from discontinued operations, were EUR 4.66 (3.55), including the
EUR 4.82 gain from the sale of the Swedish electricity distribution business. Earnings per share for
total Fortum in 2014 were impacted by EUR 2.08 per share from the sale of the Finnish electricity
distribution business.

is 15 TWh above the long-term average and 18 TWh higher than at the
end of 2014. Reservoir surplus compared to the long-term average
increased further during the fourth quarter due to high precipitation
and mild weather, which delayed snow accumulation. Snow
reservoirs were approximately normal at year-end.

During 2015, the average system spot price was EUR 21.0 (29.6).
The decline was due to the highest annual inflow ever reported
and correspondingly very high hydro production volumes as well
as mild weather and low commodity prices. In addition, wind
power production increased during the year, impacting spot prices
negatively. The average area price in Finland was EUR 29.7 (36.0)
and in Sweden SE3 (Stockholm) EUR 22.0 (31.6).

In Germany the average spot price during 2015 was EUR 31.6

The market price of CO, emission allowances (EUA) was at
approximately EUR 7.1 per tonne at the beginning of the year and

Russia

Fortum operates in the Tyumen and Khanty-Mansiysk area of
Western Siberia, where industrial production is dominated by the oil
and gas industries, and in the Chelyabinsk area of the Urals, which is
dominated by the metal industry.

According to preliminary statistics Russia consumed 1,007 (1,02!)
TWh of electricity during 2015. The corresponding figure in Fortum's
operating area in the First price zone (European and Urals part of
Russia) was 772 (777) TWh.

In 2015 the average electricity spot price, excluding capacity
price, decreased by 0.8% to RUB 1,154 (1,163) per MWh in the First
price zone.

European business environment
and carbon market

Paris Agreement

In December 2015, a global climate agreement for the post-2020
period was adopted. All countries are obligated to prepare national
contributions, including mitigation, adaptation and financing, to

be reviewed every five years. The long-term goal is to keep the
temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels with
efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.

The agreement increases long-term stability and predictability,
encourages market-driven actions and reduces the risk of carbon
leakage. Potentially, it can result in an accelerated low-carbon
energy transition and new business opportunities. However, there
will be no direct impact on CO, price unless the EU decides to
increase its 2030 target. The EU Heads of States will discuss the
results of Paris and the possible consequences on EU targets and
policies in March 2016.

EU emissions trading reform

In 2015, the EU Council formally adopted the European Commission’s
proposal to create a reserve to hold surplus CO, permits under

the EU Emissions Trading System. This means that the proposed

< 8>

Market Stability Reserve will become operational in January 2019 and
will remove 12% of the net surplus each year, as long as it remains
above 833 million tonnes. The EU Environment Council adopted the
legislation on behalf of the wider EU Council.

EU power market development

The public consultation on the new EU electricity market design
was closed in 2015. Although the aim of the consultation is to collect
input from different stakeholders, the European Commission has
already stated quite clearly that its preference is to focus on further
development of the current energy-only market design rather

than going towards capacity markets. In particular, fixed capacity
payments are not favoured because of their highly distortive nature.
The Commission will put forward proposals for a comprehensive
revision of the energy market-related legislation in the autumn 2016.

State of the Energy Union Report

In November 2015, the European Commission published the first
edition of the annual "State of the EU Energy Union" report. It
included reports on each member states' progress in implementing
the EU energy and climate targets, and the key principles for the
governance system to ensure implementation of the Energy Union
in a transparent and predictable way. The report also underlines the
EU's ambition to continue the EU leadership in the transition to a
low-carbon economy after COP21, and to ensure that the transition
is socially fair and consumer-centred. Continuing geopolitical
challenges are also noted in the report.

Circular Economy Package
In December 2015, the EU Commission also proposed a Circular
Economy package aiming at better resource efficiency and high-
quality reuse of products and recycling of waste. The proposal
includes amendments to several waste-related directives and
ambitious EU targets for reuse and recycling of all waste streams.
The Commission is proposing a ban on the landfilling of separately
collected waste and limiting the share of landfilled municipal waste
to amaximum of 10% by 2030.

When waste cannot be prevented or recycled, using it for energy
is preferred to landfilling. 'Waste to energy' can therefore play a
bigger role in the EU energy and climate policy. The Commission
will examine how the energy potential can best be exploited and will
adopt a waste-to-energy initiative in the framework of the Energy
Union during 2016.

1) The Nordic power sales income and volume does not include thermal generation,
market price-related purchases or minorities.

In 2015, the Power and Technology segment's comparable operating
profit was EUR 561 (877) million, i.e. EUR 316 million lower than in
2014 mainly due to a lower achieved power price. Hydro volumes
were historically high, 2.7 TWh, higher than in 2014, while nuclear
volumes were 0.9 TWh lower due to unplanned outages in Swedish
co-owned nuclear power plants.

Operating profit, EUR -396 (855) million, was affected by write-
downs and provisions regarding the closure of Oskarshamn nuclear
plant units | and 2 in Sweden and of the Finnish coal-fired power
plants Inkoo and Meri-Pori, as well as the cancelled Olkiluoto 4
nuclear power project in Finland totalling approximately EUR -915
(0) million, and by sales gains from the sale of property, plant and
equipment totalling approximately EUR 18 (52) million, as well as
by the IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives, mainly
used for hedging Fortum's power production, and nuclear fund
adjustments amounting to EUR -60 (-73) million.

Power and Technology's achieved Nordic power price was EUR 33.0
(41.4) per MWh, EUR 8.4 per MWh lower than in the corresponding
period in 2014. The system price and all area prices were clearly
lower in 2015 compared to 2014. The average system spot price of
electricity in Nord Pool was EUR 21.0 (29.6) per MWh. The average
area price in Finland was EUR 29.7 (36.0) per MWh and in Sweden
SE3 (Stockholm) EUR 22.0 (31.6) per MWh. The weather during the
year was extraordinary and impacted the electricity price level: the
first quarter of 2015 was exceptionally mild and the second quarter
was characterised by among the highest precipitation in recent
history. Mild weather in the fourth quarter reduced consumption and
increased inflows. In addition, high wind-power generation limited
the use of hydropower.

The segment's total power generation in the Nordic countries
was 48.1 (47.1) TWh, |.o TWh higher than in 2014 due to very high
hydro volumes. Thermal production totalled 0.3 (0.9) TWh in the
Nordic countries. CO, free production amounted to 99% (97%) of the
total production.

The liberalisation of the Russian wholesale power market was
completed in the beginning of 2011. However, all generating
companies continue to sell a part of their electricity and capacity

- an amount equalling the consumption of households and a few
special groups of consumers - under regulated prices. During 2015,
Fortum sold approximately 83% of its power production in Russia at a
liberalised electricity price.

All of Fortum's capacity was allowed to participate in the
capacity selection for generation built prior to 2008 (CCS - "old
capacity") for 2015, and the majority of Fortum's plants were also
selected. The volume of Fortum’s installed capacity not selected
in the auction totalled 195 MW (approximately 7% of Fortum’s total
old capacity in Russia), for which Fortum has obtained forced mode
status, i.e. it has received payments for the capacity.

The generation capacity built after 2007 under the Russian
Government's capacity supply agreement (CSA - "new capacity")
receives guaranteed payments for a period of 10 years. The period
and the prices for capacity under CSA were defined to ensure a
sufficient return on investments. At the time of the acquisition in
2008, Fortum made a provision, as penalty clauses are included in
the CSA in case of possible delays. If the new capacity is delayed or
if the agreed major terms of the capacity supply agreement are not

otherwise fulfilled, possible penalties can be claimed. The effect of
changes in the timing of commissioning of new units is assessed at
each balance sheet date and the provision is changed accordingly.

Received capacity payments vary depending on the age,
location, type and size of the plant as well as seasonality and
availability. The CSA payments can also vary somewhat annually
because they are linked to the Russian Government long-term
bonds with 8 to 10 years maturity. In addition, the regulator will
review the guaranteed CSA payments by re-examining earnings
from the electricity-only market three and six years after the
commissioning of a unit and could revise the CSA payments
accordingly.

In February 2015, the System Administrator of the wholesale
market published data on the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) and the consumer price index (CPI) for 2014, which was
used to calculate the capacity price on CSA in 2015. The CSA
payments were revised upwards accordingly to reflect the higher
bond rates.

In 2015 the Russia segment's power sales volumes amounted to
29.4 (26.5) TWh and heat sales volumes totalled 25.4 (26.0) TWh in
2015.

The Russia segment's comparable operating profit was EUR
201 (161) million. The positive effect from the new units receiving
CSA payments amounted to approximately EUR 244 (165) million,
including a EUR 52 (4) million CSA provision release. Lower heat
volumes due to warm weather, lower income from heat connections
and lower electricity prices impacted the result negatively
compared to 2014. The weakened Russian rouble affected the
Russia segment's 2015 result negatively by EUR 71 million.

Operating profit was EUR 203 (161) million.

The third unit of Fortum's Nyagan power plant started
commercial operation at the end of 2014 and started receiving
capacity payments under the Russian Government's capacity
supply agreement for 418 megawatts (MW) as of | January 2015.

In November 2015, Fortum commissioned unit | of its
Chelyabinsk GRES combined heat and power plant in Russia.
Fortum started receiving capacity payments for Chelyabinsk 1
under the Russian Government's capacity supply agreement
(CSA) as of | December 2015. Fortum’s extensive investment
programme in Russia that started in 2008 is now nearly completed,
as unit 2 of Chelyabinsk GRES is estimated to start commercial
operation in early 2016. The slight postponement is due to delays in
construction.

Power and Technology

Through its interest in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), Fortum is
participating in the building of Olkiluoto 3 (OL3), a 1,600-MW nuclear
power plant unit in Finland. The start of commercial electricity
production of the plant is expected to take place in late 2018,
according to the plant supplier AREVA-Siemens Consortium. TVO
has withdrawn a EUR 300 million shareholder loan from the total EUR
600 million commitments. Fortum's share of the EUR 300 million
withdrawals is approximately EUR 75 million. Fortum’s remaining
commitment for OL3 is EUR 75 million.

In 2015, the Extraordinary General Meeting of TVO decided not
to apply for a construction licence for the Olkiluoto 4 (OL4) nuclear
power plant during the validity of the decision-in-principle made
in 2010. In addition, the Finnish Government granted a license to
Posiva for the construction of a final disposal facility for spent
nuclear fuel. The final disposal of the spent fuel generated in the

< 12>

Olkiluoto and Loviisa nuclear power plants into the Finnish bedrock
is planned to start in the early 2020's.

In 2015 Fortum also decided to participate in the Fennovoima
nuclear power project in Finland with a 6.6% share on the same
terms and conditions as the other Finnish companies currently
participating in the project. Participation will be carried out through
Voimaosakeyhtid SF.

Fortum's associated company OKG AB's Extraordinary
shareholders' meeting in 2015 decided on an early closure of
Oskarshamn nuclear power plant units | and 2 in Sweden. For unit 1,
it means that the unit will be taken out of operation and transferred
into service mode after the applied environmental permit has been
received, approximately during 2017-2019. For unit 2, which has
been out of operation since June 2013 due to an extensive safety
modernisation, it means that the unit will not be put back into
operation. The closing process for both units is estimated to take
several years.

Heat, Electricity Sales and Solutions

Fortum is investing in a new biofuel CHP plant through Fortum
Varme, its joint venture with the City of Stockholm. The new CHP
plant, located in Vartan, Stockholm, Sweden, will replace some of
the existing heat production, and it is planned to be commissioned in
2016. The new plant will have a production capacity of 280 MW heat
and 130 MW electricity.

In addition, Fortum is participating in its joint venture Turun
Seudun Energiantuotanto Oy's (TSE) new CHP plant in Naantali,
Finland, which will replace the existing old plant. The plan is to
commission the new power plant in 2017. The plant's production
capacity will be 244 MW heat and 142 MW electricity.

In 2015, Fortum launched a greenfield solar PV plant Kapeli, in
Madhya Pradesh, India. This solar plant is Fortum's second solar
energy project in the country. The 1o-MW solar plant will offset
more than 18,000 tonnes of CO, emissions equivalent annually.

Fortum also decided to build a new multifuel CHP plant in
Zabrze, Poland. The total value of the investment is approximately
EUR 200 million. The new plant is planned to start commercial
operation by the end of 2018. The plant's production capacity will be
145 MW heat and 75 MW electricity.

Russia

In December 2015 Fortum announced a EUR 65 million investment
to start wind farm project in Ulyanovsk, Russia with a total capacity
of 35 MW. The wind farm is expected to start production in 2017. The

Sustainability

Fortum strives for balanced management of economic, social and
environmental responsibility in the company’s operations. Fortum's
sustainability targets consist of Group-level key indicators and
division-level indicators.

The Group-level sustainability targets emphasise Fortum's
role in society and measure not only environmental and safety
targets, but also Fortum's reputation, customer satisfaction, and
the security of production of power and heat. At the beginning of

< 13>

2015, Group-level target setting was changed by taking the energy
savings yielded by energy-efficiency measures as an indicator in
energy efficiency, and total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) as an
indicator in occupational safety for Fortum employees. Moreover, a
new target of reducing serious injuries by 50% as compared to 2014
was added to Group-level target setting.

The achievement of the sustainability targets is monitored
in the monthly, quarterly and annual reporting. Sustainability
target-setting and follow-up as well as the approval of Fortum's
Sustainability policy and the review of Fortum's Sustainability
Report are included in the working order of the Board of Directors.
Complete data on Fortum's sustainability performance is published
on Fortum's Sustainability website.

The company is listed on STOXX Global ESG Leaders, Nasdaq
Helsinki, OMX GES Sustainability Finland and ECPI® indices. Fortum
is also included in the Carbon Disclosure Project’s Nordic Climate
Index and has received Prime Status (B-) rating by the German
oekom research AG.

Targets for reputation and customer satisfaction are monitored
annually. Company reputation among the key stakeholders in the
One Fortum Survey in 2015 improved to 71.75 points (on a scale of
1-100 points) and was above the target of 70.8 points. Customer
satisfaction improved, and the Group target (70-74 points) was
achieved in all business areas except in electricity sales for business
customers.

Economic responsibility

In the area of economic responsibility, the focus is on competitiveness,
performance excellence and market-driven production. The aim is to
create long-term economic value and enable profitable growth and
added value for shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, and
other key stakeholders in the company's operating areas. Fortum's
goal is to achieve excellent financial performance in strategically
selected core areas through strong competence and responsible ways
of operating. In 2015, Fortum measured financial performance with
return on capital employed (target: 12%) and capital structure (target:
comparable net debt/EBITDA around 2.5). In addition, as of | January
2014, Fortum has used the applicable Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI) Gq indicators for reporting economic responsibility.

Fortum as a tax payer

Fortum supports social development and well-being of the areas

of operations by e.g. paying taxes. The tax benefits Fortum
produces to society include not only corporate income taxes EUR
-78 million (2014: 143) but also several other taxes. In 2015, Fortum's
taxes borne were EUR 413 million (2014: 464). Taxes borne include
corporate income taxes, production taxes, employment taxes, taxes
on property and cost of indirect taxes. Production taxes include

also taxes paid through electricity purchased from associated
companies.

In addition, Fortum administers and collects different taxes on
behalf of governments and authorities. Such taxes include e.g. VAT,
excise taxes on power consumed by customers, payroll taxes and
withholding taxes. The amount of taxes collected by Fortum was
EUR 352 million (2014: 336). See additional infomation in Fortum as
a taxpayer.

Environmental responsibility

Fortum's environmental responsibility emphasises mitigation of
climate change, efficient use of resources as well as management
of the impacts of its energy production and supply chain. The
company’s know-how in carbon-free hydro and nuclear power
production and in energy-efficient CHP production is highlighted in
environmental responsibility. Fortum’s Group-level environmental
targets are related to CO, emissions, energy efficiency as well as
major environmental, health and safety (EHS) incidents. At the end
of 2015, ISO 14001 certification covered 99.9% of Fortum's power and
heat production worldwide.

Fortum’s climate targets over the next five years are: specific
CO, emissions from power generation in the EU below 80 grams per
kilowatt-hour (g/kWh) and total specific CO, emissions from both
electricity and heat production in all countries below 200 g/kWh. Both
targets are calculated as a five-year average. At the end of 2015, the
five-year average for specific CO, emissions from power generation
in the EU was at 50 (60) g/kWh and the total specific CO, emissions
from energy production were at 191 (198) g/kWh, both better than
the target level.

Fortum's total CO, emissions in 2015 amounted to 19.2 (20.3)
million tonnes (Mt), of which 2.1 (3.6) Mt were within the EU's
emissions trading scheme (ETS). Since 2013, electricity production
has not received free allowances in the EU ETS. The amount of free
allowances for heat will also gradually decrease during 2013-2020.
Fortum's free allowances 2015 were 1.3 Mt.

Fortum's total C Ch re
(million tonnes, Mt) 2015 2014 15/14
Total emissions 19.2 20.3 -5%
Emissions subject to ETS 24 3.6 42%
Free emission allocation 1.3 14 7%
Emissions in Russia 17.0 16.7 2%

By 2020, Fortum's target is to improve energy efficiency of the
existing power plants and heat distribution networks by over 1,400
GWh annually, as compared with 2012. At the end of 2015, about 1,240
GWh of this target was achieved. In 2015, Fortum commissioned the
Suomenoja heat pump facility and the flue gas condenser at the
Joensuu power plant in Finland and improved performance of the
turbine plants at the Argayash and Chelyabinsk CHP 3 power plants
in Russia. The projects in 2015 result in an annual energy savings of
approximately 560 GWh.

Fortum's target was fewer than 27 major EHS incidents
annually. In 2015, 18 (27) major EHS incidents took place in Fortum's
operations: one explosion, two leaks into the environment and 15
non-compliances with environmental permits. These incidents did
not have significant environmental or financial impact.

Social responsibility
In the area of social responsibility, Fortum's innovations and
the secure production of low-CO, power and heat support the
development of society and increase well-being. Good corporate
citizenship and ensuring a safe working environment for all
employees and contractors at Fortum’s sites are emphasised. At the
end of 2015, OHSAS 18001 certification covered 99.9% of Fortum's
power and heat production worldwide.
In 2015, the average energy availability of Fortum's CHP plants was
96.4% (94.7%), which is clearly above the annual target level of 95%.
At the end of 2015, the total recordable injury frequency (TRIF)
for Fortum employees was 1.6 (2.0) per one million working hours,
which complies with the Group-level frequency target (< 2.5).
The lost-workday injury frequency for contractors was 2.7 (3.2),
which is below the set target level of 3.2. The number of serious
occupational accidents was 16, which is too many and means that
the set 50% reduction target for 2015 (8 serious accidents) was not
met. Implementation of the agreed actions to improve contractor
safety continues with a specific focus on construction projects.
Fortum's target is to eliminate serious injuries by 2020. No fatalities
occurred during the year.

Fortum expects its business partners to act responsibly and to
comply with the Fortum Code of Conduct and the Fortum Supplier
Code of Conduct. Fortum assesses the performance of its business
partners with supplier pre-selection and supplier audits. In 2015,
Fortum audited 9 suppliers in Poland, the Czech Republic, Russia,
Kazakhstan and India.

Changes in Fortum's Management

Tapio Kuula, President and CEO, retired on 1 February 2015. Tapio
Kuula had been President and CEO of Fortum Corporation since 2009.
On 2 April 2015, Pekka Lundmark, M.Sc. (Eng.), 51, was appointed
President and CEO of Fortum Corporation. Mr. Lundmark started at
Fortum on 7 September 2015.
Until Mr. Lundmark joined Fortum, CFO Timo Karttinen acted as
interim President and CEO of Fortum.

Events after the balance sheet date

On 8 January 2016, Fortum made a public tender offer in Poland to
purchase all shares in Grupa Duon SA, an electricity and gas sales
company listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Fortum will carry
out the acquisition if it receives at least 51% of the shares by the

end of the offer period. The offer period commences on 28 January
2016 and is estimated to close on 26 February 2016. The offer has
been made in compliance with the Polish legislation and rules of the
Warsaw Stock Exchange, and it is subject to clearance of the Polish
competition authority.

On 22 January 2016, Fortum's Nomination Board proposed to
the Annual General Meeting that the Board consists of eight (8)
members and that the following persons be elected to the Board
of Directors for a term ending at the end of the Annual General
Meeting 2017: to be re-elected Ms Sari Baldauf as Chairman,

Mr Kim Ignatius as Deputy Chairman, and as members;

Ms Minoo Akhtarzand, Mr Heinz-Werner Binzel, Ms Eva Hamilton,
Mr Tapio Kuula and Mr Jyrki Talvitie and to be elected as new board
memeber; Mr Veli-Matti Reinikkala.

In addition, the Shareholders' Nomination Board will propose
that the annual fees paid for the term to be as follows: Chairman:
EUR 75,000, Deputy Chairman: EUR 57,000, and members: EUR
40,000. The Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee, if he/she is

< 15 >

not simultaneously acting as Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the
Board: EUR 57,000/year.

Outlook

Key drivers and risks

Fortum's financial results are exposed to a number of economic,
strategic, political, financial and operational risks. One of the

key factors influencing Fortum's business performance is the
wholesale price of electricity in the Nordic region. The key drivers
behind the wholesale price development in the Nordic region are
the supply-demand balance, the prices of fuel and CO, emissions
allowances, as well as the hydrological situation. The completion of
Fortum's investment programme in Russia is also a key driver in the
company's result growth, due to the increase in production volumes
and CSA payments.

The continued global and European uncertainty has kept the
outlook for economic growth unpredictable. The overall economic
uncertainty impacts commodity and CO, emissions allowance prices,
and this could maintain downward pressure on the Nordic wholesale
price of electricity. In Fortum's Russian business, the key factors
are economic growth, the rouble exchange rate, the regulation
around the heat business, and further development of electricity
and capacity markets. Operational risks related to the investment
projects in the current investment programme are still valid. In
all regions, fuel prices and power plant availability also impact
profitability. In addition, increased volatility in exchange rates due
to financial turbulence could have both translation and transaction
effects on Fortum's financials, especially through the Russian rouble
and Swedish krona. In the Nordic countries, also the regulatory and
fiscal environment for the energy sector has added risks for utility
companies.

For further details on Fortum's risks and risk management, see
the Risk management section of the Operating and financial review
and Note 3 Financial risk management.

Nordic market
Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, electricity is expected to
continue to gain a higher share of the total energy consumption.
Electricity demand is expected to grow in the Nordic countries by
approximately 0.5% on average in the coming years.

During 2015, the price of the European Union emissions
allowances appreciated, whereas oil and coal prices declined. The

Auditor’s report | Quarterly financial information | Investor information

price of electricity for the upcoming twelve months declined in the
Nordic area as well as in Germany.

In late-January 2016 the quotation for coal (ICE Rotterdam) for
the rest of 2016 was around USD 42 per tonne, and for CO, emission
allowances for 2016 about EUR 6 per tonne. The Nordic system
electricity forward price in Nasdaq Commodities for the rest of
2016 was around EUR 19 per MWh and for 2017 around EUR 18 per
MWh. In Germany, the electricity forward price for the rest of 2016
was around EUR 25 per MWh and for 2017 around EUR 24 per MWh.
Nordic water reservoirs were about 9 TWh above the long-term
average and 8 TWh above the corresponding level of 2015.

Power and Technology

The Power and Technology segment’s (achieved) Nordic power price
typically depends on such factors as hedge ratios, hedge prices,
spot prices, availability and utilisation of Fortum's flexible production
portfolio and currency fluctuations. Excluding the potential effects
from changes in the power generation mix, a 1 EUR/MWh change

in the Power and Technology segment’s Nordic power sales
(achieved) price will result in an approximately EUR 45 million change
in Fortum's annual comparable operating profit. In addition, the
comparable operating profit of the Power and Technology segment
will be affected by the possible thermal power generation volumes
and its profits.

As a result of the nuclear stress tests in the EU, the Swedish
nuclear safety authority (SSM) has decided to propose new
regulations for Swedish nuclear reactors. The process is ongoing.
Fortum emphasises that maintaining a high level of nuclear safety is
the highest priority, but considers EU-level harmonisation of nuclear
safety requirements to be of utmost importance.

In 2015, the Swedish Government increased the nuclear waste
fund fee for the period 2015-2017 from approximately 0.022 to
approximately 0.04 SEK/kWh. The estimated impact on Fortum is
approximately EUR 25 million annually. The process to review the
Swedish nuclear waste fees is done in a three-year cycle. However,
as a result of the decision on early closure of nuclear power plants,
the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, SSM, recalculated the
waste fees for the Oskarshamn and Ringhals power plants. The new
assessment needs the approval of the Swedish Government.

In addition, the Swedish Parliament decided to approve the
proposed tax increase of 17% on installed nuclear capacity. The
tax was implemented as of | August 2015. The estimated impact on
Fortum is approximately EUR !5 million in 2016, albeit corporate tax-

deductible. The future of the nuclear tax is subject to active political
debate in Sweden.

In October 2015, OKG AB's extraordinary shareholders' meeting
decided on the closure of Oskarshamn nuclear power plant units |
and 2 in Sweden. For unit 1, it means that the unit will be taken out
of operation and transferred into service mode after the applied
environmental permit has been received, approximately during
2017-2019. For unit 2, which has been out of operation since June
2013 due to an extensive safety modernisation, it means that the
unit will not be put back into operation. The closing process for
both units is estimated to take several years.

In August 2015, Fortum decided to participate in the Fennovoima
nuclear power project in Finland with a 6.6%-share and on the same
terms and conditions as the other Finnish companies currently
participating in the project. Participation will be carried out through
Voimaosakeyhtio SF.

Russia

The Russia segment's new capacity generation built after 2007 under
the Russian Government's capacity supply agreement (CSA) is a

key driver for earnings growth in Russia, as it is expected to bring
income from new volumes sold and also to receive considerably
higher capacity payments than the old capacity. It receives
guaranteed capacity payments currently for a period of 1o years.

A draft regulation related to the time frame (in the future 10 or 15
years) regarding the calculation has been submitted for review to
the federal executive authorities, and a decision is expected during
first half of 2016. Prices for capacity under CSA are defined in order
to ensure a sufficient return on investments. The received capacity
payment will vary depending on the age, location, size and type of
the plants as well as on seasonality and availability. The return on the
new capacity is guaranteed, as regulated in the CSA. CSA payments
can vary somewhat annually because they are linked to Russian
Government long-term bonds with 8 to 10 years maturity. In addition,
the regulator will review the earnings from the electricity-only market
three years and six years after the commissioning of a unit and could
revise the CSA payments accordingly.

In February 2016, the System Administrator of the wholesale
market is planning to publish data on the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) and the consumer price index (CPI) for 2015, which
is used to calculate the capacity price on CSA in 2016.

The value of the remaining part of Fortum's investment
programme, calculated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end

< 16 >

of December 2015, is estimated to be approximately EUR 100 million,
as of January 2016.

According to the new rules approved by the Russian
Government in 2015, the competitive capacity selection for
generation built prior to 2008 (CCS, without capacity supply
agreements) takes place annually. At the end of 2015, the CCS
for 2016 and the long-term CCS for 2017-2019 were held. The
majority of Fortum’s plants were selected. The volume of Fortum’s
installed capacity not selected in the auction totalled 195 MW for
which Fortum has obtained forced mode status, i.e. it will receive
payments for the capacity. In 2016, the CCS for year 2020 will take
place.

The targeted operating profit (EBIT) level of RUB 18.2 billion in
the Russia segment is targeted to be reached during 2017-2018. The
segment’s profits are impacted by changes in power demand, gas
prices and other regulatory development. The economic sanctions,
currency crisis, oil price and the surge in inflation have impacted
overall demand. As a result, gas prices and electricity prices have
not developed favourably as expected. Previously, the run-rate
operating profit level (EBIT) was targeted to be reached during 2015
after finalising the investment programme.

The euro-denominated result level will be volatile due to the
translation effect. The income statements of non-euro subsidiaries
are translated into the Group reporting currency using the average
exchange rates. The Russia segment's result is also impacted by
seasonal volatility caused by the nature of the heat business, with
the first and last quarter being clearly the strongest.

In 2014, the new heat market model roadmap proposed by the
Ministry of Energy was approved by the Russian Government; if
implemented the reform should give heat market liberalisation by
2020 or, in some specific areas, by 2023.

As forecasted by the Russian Ministry of Economic
Development, Russian annual average gas price growth is estimated
to be 4.9% in 2016.

Restructuring of TGC-1 according to strategy in Russia

In December 2014, Fortum, Gazprom Energoholding LLC and
Rosatom State Corporation signed a protocol to start a restructuring
process of the ownership of TGC-1 in Russia. The discussions have
not yet come to a conclusion. It is not possible to estimate the
timetable.

Capital expenditure and divestments

Fortum currently expects its capital expenditure for its continuing
operations in 2016 to be approximately EUR 650 million. The annual
maintenance capital expenditure is estimated to be about EUR
300-350 million in 2016, below the level of depreciation.

Taxation

The effective corporate income tax rate for Fortum in 2016 is
estimated to be 19-21%, excluding the impact of the share of profits
of associated companies and joint ventures, non-taxable capital
gains and non-recurring items.

In August 2014, the Finnish Board of Adjustment of the Large
Taxpayers' Office approved Fortum Corporation's appeal of the
income tax assessment imposed on Fortum for the year 2007 in
December 2013. The Tax Recipients' Legal Services Unit appealed
the matter. In December 2014, Fortum received a non-taxation
decision regarding its financing companies for the remaining
years 2008-2011, based on the same audit. This is in line with the
Supreme Administrative Court’s (SAC) precedent decision. The
Tax Recipients' Legal Services Unit has appealed the decisions in
February 2015, and the cases for years 2008-2011 are now pending
the Board of Adjustment of the Large Taxpayers’ Office decision. In
line with the 2007 case, Fortum considers the claims unjustifiable.

In June, the Swedish Parliament approved the 17% increase on
the tax on installed nuclear capacity, re-proposed by the Swedish
Government. The tax was implemented as of 1 August 2015. The
estimated impact on Fortum is approximately EUR 15 million in 2016,
albeit corporate tax-deductible.

Hedging
At the end of December 2015, approximately 50% of Power and
Technology's estimated Nordic power sales volume was hedged at
approximately EUR 33 per MWh for the year 2016. The corresponding
figures for the 2017 calendar year were approximately 20% at
approximately EUR 30 per MWh.

The reported hedge ratios may vary significantly, depending on
Fortum's actions on the electricity derivatives markets. Hedges
are mainly financial contracts, most of them Nasdaq Commodities
forwards.

Risk management

Risk management framework and objectives

Fortum is continuously adapting its risk management capabilities
to cope with prevailing market conditions, changing operations and
the business environment. In 2015, the focus was on improving the
framework for internal controls and compliance risk management
and integrating them to the operational risk management
framework.

Implementation of newly established processes for country and
partner assessments, including sustainability and human rights
impact assessments, has also continued.

Risk management objective

The objective of risk management in Fortum is to support the
creation and execution of the Group strategy, to support the
achievement of agreed business plans and to avoid unwanted
operational events.

Group risk policy

Fortum's Board of Directors annually approves the Group Risk
Policy, which defines the high-level objectives and principles,
delegates responsibilities for risk management activities within
the Group, and sets minimum requirements for risk management
processes.

The CEO approves Group Risk Instructions covering commodity
market risks, counterparty credit risks, currency, interest rate,
liquidity and refinancing risks, and operational and compliance
risks. The main principle is that risks are managed at source
unless otherwise agreed by management. Corporate Treasury
is responsible for managing the Group’s currency, interest rate,

liquidity and refinancing risks as well as for insurance management.

Corporate Credit is responsible for assessing and consolidating
credit exposure, monitoring creditworthiness, and setting credit
limits for the Group's largest counterparties. Corporate IT is
responsible for managing IT information and security risks. There
are also corporate functions dealing with risks related to human
resources, laws and regulation, and sustainability.

Risk management organisation

The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) is responsible for monitoring
the efficiency of the company’s risk management systems.
Corporate Risk Management, a function headed by the Chief Risk
Officer (CRO) reporting to the CFO, is responsible for assessing

and reporting the Group's risk exposures to the ARC and

Group Management. In order to secure independency from line
management, risk controllers conduct risk controlling tasks such as
mandate sign-offs and risk model approvals.

Risk reporting is based on CRO approved models, templates
and principles. The frequency of reporting is dependent on the
materiality and volatility of the risks. For example, exposure to
commodity market risks are followed-up and potential
mandate breaches are reported daily whereas strategic and
operational risks are reported as part of the annual business
planning process and followed up in quarterly management
reviews. Corporate Risk Management follows-up the Group's
exposure to market and credit risk monthly and reports quarterly
to Group Management.

< 18 >

Risk management process

The risk management process consists of event identification, risk
assessment, risk response and risk control and reporting. Every unit
is responsible for responding to risks by taking appropriate actions
to avoid, mitigate, transfer or absorb the risk.

Risk factors

Strategic risks

Investment, integration and project risks

Fortum's strategy includes growth of operations and any future

investment. Large project or acquisition could entail risk to existing

operations, including:

* increased overall operating complexity and requirements for
management, personnel and other resources;

* the need to understand and manage the new markets and
different cultural and compliance requirements;

* the need to understand and manage subcontractor risks and
related sustainability and safety issues.

These risks are mitigated as part of investment, integration and

project planning.

Political and regulatory risks

The political and regulatory environment has a clear impact on
energy businesses. This applies both to existing and potential new
businesses and market areas, and Fortum is therefore exposed to
regulatory risks in various countries.

Nordic /EU

Fortum favours a market-driven development, which would mean
more interconnections and competition supported by policy
harmonization. Infrastructure development and integration of the
Nordic electricity market towards continental Europe depend to a
large extent on the actions of authorities. The current trend in some
European countries of increasingly national policies could endanger
the market-driven development of the energy sector.

The biggest potential risks within the policy framework relate
to the electricity market model, targets for future climate change
mitigation and renewable energy. In particular, the inter-linkage
of these issues create uncertainty as they are overlapping and
changes in policies in one area could undermine the effects of
policy changes in other areas.

The EU is currently discussing capacity remuneration
mechanisms that could change the market model. The specific
details of targets for CO. emissions, renewables and energy
efficiency for 2030 are also under discussion, and in the context
of renewables the Commission aims at presenting a legislative
proposal on sustainability criteria for solid biomass. Furthermore,
the nuclear safety directive is in the implementation phase, and a
discussion on broadening nuclear liability in the EU is starting.

As part of the Circular Economy package, the EU waste
legislation shall be improved together with setting more ambitious
recycling targets for waste. This will have a market impact, but
possibly also a tax impact, on the amounts of non-recyclable waste
that can be used for energy production. The preparations for EU's
heating and cooling strategy during 2015-16 shall likely give policy
direction towards better-functioning heat markets and district
heating systems.

All these pose risks, but also opportunities, for energy
companies. To manage these risks and proactively participate
in the development of the political and regulatory framework,
Fortum maintains an active dialogue with the bodies involved in the
development of laws and regulations at national and EU-levels.

< 19>

Russia

Russia is exposed to political, economic and social uncertainties and
risks resulting from changes in regulation, legislation, economic and
social upheaval and other similar factors. The Ukraine crisis and EU
and US economic sanctions have increased the risks and made the
business environment more challenging.

The main policy-related risks in Russia are linked to the
development of the whole energy sector, part of which, like
wholesale electric energy, is liberalised while other parts, like
gas, heat, and retail electricity, are not. The wholesale power
market deregulation in Russia has proceeded well and to a large
extent according to original plans. However, there is a risk that
the Government will freeze tariffs of certain regulated products
including gas, which creates a risk for Fortum's operations. Fortum
is continuously monitoring the development and implements risk
mitigation actions if deemed necessary.

Political risk concerning taxes

The current economic situation in Fortum's key operating countries
has created a tax environment that is leading to new or increased
taxes and new interpretations of existing tax laws. This, in turn, has
led to unexpected challenges for Fortum and how its operations are
taxed as the predictability and visibility around taxes has decreased.
Fortum is continuously following the development of tax related
issues and their impact on the Group and takes appropriate actions
to mitigate the risk if needed.

Legal and compliance risks

Fortum's operations are subject to laws, rules and regulations set
forth by the relevant authorities, exchanges, and other regulatory
bodies in all markets in which Fortum operates, and compliance to
these is a prioritized area.

Fortum's ability to operate in certain countries may be adversely
affected by difficulties in protecting and enforcing its rights in
disputes with its contractual partners or other parties, and also by
future changes to local laws and regulations.

Fortum has enhanced its compliance risk management process
to systematically identify and mitigate compliance risks including
risks related to sustainability and business ethics. Fortum has zero
tolerance against corruption and the compliance risk management
process also aims to capture potential bribery risks. In addition,


--- Page 18 ---

Operating and financial review | Primary statements | Notes | Key figures

Parent company financial statements | Proposal for the distribution of earnings

Financial performance and position | Risk management | Fortum share and shareholders

Auditor’s report | Quarterly financial information | Investor information

Fortum has an established Code of Conduct to enhance the
understanding of the importance of business ethics for all Fortum
employees, contractors and partners. The supplier code of conduct
sets sustainability requirements for suppliers of goods and services.
Fortum maintains internal controls to minimise the possibilities of
unauthorised activities.

The assessment of compliance risks is periodic and
documented. Line management regularly reports on the business
ethics to Group Management and further to the ARC.

Technology risks
Fortum's R&D activities focus on the development of the advanced
technologies included in Fortum's existing energy system as well
as new technologies and solutions supporting development of the
energy system towards a future solar economy.

Fortum is, for example, developing solar and wave energy
and bio-oil as well as innovative solutions for its customers. New
technologies expose Fortum to new types of risks such as risks
related to intellectual property rights and viability of technologies.

Financial Risks

Commodity markets and fuels risk

Commodity market risk refers to the potential negative effects of
market price movements or volume changes in electricity, fuels and
environmental values. A number of different methods, such as Profit-
at-Risk and Value-at-Risk, are used to quantify these risks and to
take into account their interdependencies. Stress-testing is carried
out in order to assess the effects of extreme price movements on
Fortum's earnings.

Fortum hedges its exposure to commodity market risks in
accordance with annually approved Hedging Guidelines. Risk taking
is limited by risk mandates, including volumetric limits, Profit-at-Risk
limits and stop-loss limits. The Profit-at-Risk measure is monitored
quarterly by management.

All products and marketplaces used for hedging and trading are
approved by the CRO.

For further information on hedge ratios, exposures, sensitivities
and outstanding derivatives contracts, see Note 3 Financial risk
management.

Electricity price and volume risks

Fortum is exposed to electricity market price movements and
volume changes mainly through its power and heat generation and
customer sales businesses. In competitive markets, such as in the
Nordic region, the price is determined as the balance between
supply and demand. The short-term factors affecting electricity
prices on the Nordic market include hydrological conditions,
temperature, CO, allowance prices, fuel prices, economic
development and the import/export situation.

In the Nordic business, power and heat generation and
customer sales volumes are subject to changes in, for example,
hydrological conditions and temperature. Uncertainty in nuclear
production due to prolonged maintenance or delays in upgrades,
especially in co-owned plants in Sweden, has also increased in
recent years.

Electricity price and volume risks are hedged by entering into
electricity derivatives contracts, primarily on the Nordic power
exchange, Nasdaq Commodities (Nord Pool). The main objective
of hedging is to reduce the effect of electricity price volatility on
earnings. Hedging strategies cover several years in the short to
medium term and are executed within approved mandates. These
hedging strategies are continuously evaluated as electricity and
other commodity market prices, the hydrological balance and other
relevant parameters change.

In Russia, electricity prices and capacity sales are the main
sources of market risk. Market deregulation has developed as
planned and the electricity price is highly correlated with the
gas price. Hedges are mainly done through regulated bilateral
agreements.

Emission and environmental value risks
The European Union has established an emissions trading scheme
to reduce the amount of CO, emissions. The CO, emissions trading
scheme enhances the integration of the Nord Pool market with
the rest of Europe. In addition to the emissions trading scheme,
there are other trading schemes in environmental values in place
in Sweden, Norway and Poland. There is currently no trading
scheme in Russia for emissions or other environmental values.
The main factor influencing the prices of CO, allowances and other
environmental values is the supply and demand balance.

Part of Fortum's power and heat generation is subject to
requirements of these schemes. Fortum manages its exposure
to these prices and volumes through the use of derivatives, such

< 20>

as CO, forwards, and by ensuring that the costs of allowances
are taken into account during production planning.

Fuel price and volume risks

Heat and power generation requires use of fuels that are purchased
on global or local markets. The main fuels used by Fortum are
uranium, coal, natural gas, oil, waste and various biomass-based
fuels such as peat and wood pellets.

The main risk factor for fuels that are traded on global markets
such as coal and oil, is the uncertainty in price. Prices are largely
affected by demand and supply imbalances that can be caused by,
for example, increased demand growth in developing countries,
natural disasters or supply constraints in countries experiencing
political or social unrest. The main fuel source for heat and power
generation in Russia is natural gas. Natural gas prices are partially
regulated, so the price risk exposure is limited. For fuels traded
on local markets, such as bio-fuels, the volume risk in terms
of availability of the raw material of appropriate quality is more
significant as there may be a limited number of suppliers. Due
to the sanctions and economic development in Russia, the risks
related to imported fuels from Russia have increased. This might
have an impact to Fortum’s fuel structure.

Exposure to fuel prices is limited to some extent due to Fortum's
flexible generation capacity which allows for switching between
different fuels according to prevailing market conditions. In some
cases, the fuel price risk can even be transferred to the customer.
The remaining exposure to fuel price risk is mitigated through fixed-
price purchases based on forecasted consumption levels. Fixed-
price purchases can be either for physical deliveries or in the form
of financial hedges.

Liquidity and refinancing risks
The power and heat business is capital intensive. Consequently,
Fortum has a regular need to raise financing.

In order to manage these risks, Fortum maintains a diversified
financing structure in terms of debt maturity profile, debt
instruments and geographical markets. Fortum manages liquidity
and refinancing risks through a combination of cash positions and
committed credit facility agreements with its core banks. Due to
the volatile rouble development and sanctions imposed, special
attention has been paid to ensure that Russia Division has sufficient
liquidity to undertake committed investments.

After the Distribution divestments, Fortum has a large cash
position. The credit risk of this position has been mitigated by
diversifying the deposits.

Currency and Interest rate risks

Fortum's debt portfolio consists of interest- bearing assets and
liabilities on a fixed- and floating-rate basis with differing maturity
profiles. Fortum manages the duration of the debt portfolio through
use of different types of financing contracts and interest rate
derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps.

Fortum's currency exposures are divided into transaction
exposures (foreign exchange exposures relating to contracted cash
flows and balance sheet items where changes in exchange rates
will have an impact on earnings and cash flows) and translation
exposure (foreign exchange exposure that arises when profits
and balance sheets in foreign entities are consolidated at the
Group level). For transaction risks, the main principle is that all
material exposures should be hedged while translation exposures
are not hedged, or are hedged selectively. The rouble exposures
are monitored continuously. The main translation exposures are
EUR/RUB and EUR/SEK. The weak rouble is affecting Fortum's
profit level and equity when translating the Russia Division results
and net assets to euros.

Counterparty risks
Fortum is exposed to counterparty risk whenever there is a
contractual arrangement with an external counterparty including
customers, suppliers, partners, banks and trading counterparties.
Credit risk exposures relating to financial derivative instruments
are often volatile. Although the majority of commodity derivatives
are cleared through exchanges, derivatives contracts are also
entered into directly with external counterparties. Such contracts
are limited to high-credit-quality counterparties active on the
financial or commodity markets.
Due to the financing needs and management of liquidity,
Fortum has counterparty credit exposure to a number of banks and
financial institutions. This includes exposure to the Russian financial
sector in terms of deposits with financial institutions as well as
to banks that provide guarantees for suppliers and contracting
parties. Deposits in Russia have been concentrated to the most
creditworthy state-owned or controlled banks. Limits with banks
and financial institutions are monitored so that exposures can be
adjusted as ratings or the financial situation changes, and Fortum is

following the development of economic sanctions against Russia as
part of the monitoring process.

Credit risk exposures relating to customers is spread across
a wide range of industrial counterparties, small businesses and
private individuals over a range of geographic regions. The majority
of exposure is to the Nordic market, Poland and Russia. The risk of
non-payment in the electricity and heat sales business in Russia is
higher than in the Nordic market.

In order to minimise counterparty credit risk, Fortum has
routines and processes to identify, assess and control exposure.
Credit checks are performed before entering into commercial
obligations and creditworthiness is monitored through the use of
internal and external sources to ensure that actions can be taken if
changes occur.

Corporate Credit is responsible for setting exposure limits for all
larger individual counterparty credit exposures and for monitoring
and reporting credit exposures for banks, trading counterparties
and the largest customers in relation to approved limits.

Each division and corporate unit is responsible for ensuring that
exposures remain within approved limits and for taking mitigating
actions when needed. Mitigating actions include demanding
collateral, such as guarantees, managing payment terms and
contract length, and the use of netting agreements.

Operational risks

Operational risks are defined as the negative effects resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems
or equipment, or from external events. The main objective of
operational risk management is to reduce the risk of unwanted
operational events. Quality, environmental and occupational health
and safety as well as safety management systems are tools for
achieving this objective. Fortum's operational activities are 100%
ISO 14001 certified and the coverage of OHSAS 18001 certification
is 74%. Equipment and system risks are primarily managed through
maintenance planning and contingency plans are in place.

The objective of insurance management is to optimise loss
prevention activities, self-retentions and insurance coverage
in a long-term cost-efficient manner. Fortum has established
Group-wide insurance programmes for risks related to property
damages, business interruption and liability exposures.

Production Risks

CHP

CHP production involves the use, storage and transportation of
fuels. Leakage of fuels and contamination of the surrounding
environment could lead to clean-up costs and third-party liabilities.
An explosion or fire at a production facility could cause damages to
the plant or third-parties and lead to possible business interruption.
These risks are mitigated by condition monitoring and other
operational improvements as well as competence development of
personnel operating the plants.

Hydro power

Operational events at hydro power generation facilities can lead to
physical damages, business interruptions, and third- party liabilities.
A long-term programme is in place for improving the surveillance
of the condition of dams and for securing the discharge capacity in
extreme flood situations.

In Sweden, third-party liabilities from dam failures are strictly
the plant owner's responsibility. Together with other hydro power
producers, Fortum has a shared dam liability insurance programme
in place that covers Swedish dam failure liabilities up to SEK 9,000
million.

Nuclear power

Fortum owns the Loviisa nuclear power plant, and has minority
interests in two Finnish and two Swedish nuclear power companies.
At the Loviisa power plant, the assessment and improvement

of nuclear safety is a continuous process performed under the
supervision of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority of Finland
(STUK).

In Finland and Sweden, third-party liability relating to nuclear
accidents is strictly the plant operator's responsibility and must be
covered by insurance.

As the operator of the Loviisa power plant, Fortum has a
statutory liability insurance policy of 600M SDR (Special Drawing
Right). The same type of insurance policies are in place for the
operators where Fortum has a minority interest.

Decisions have been made in both Finland and Sweden to
renew the current nuclear liability legislation to align more with the
Paris and Brussels convention, but it is not likely to come into force
during 2016. The changes in the new national legislation consist
of a liability on plant operators covering damages up to EUR 700

million in Finland and up to EUR 1,200 million per nuclear incident in
Sweden. The liability should be covered by insurance or other form
of financial guarantee, as well as a strict and unlimited liability for
the plant operators in each respective country.

Under the Finnish law, Fortum bears full legal and financial
responsibility for the management and disposal of nuclear waste
produced bythe Loviisa power plant. In both Finland and Sweden,
Fortum bears partial responsibility, proportionate to the ownership
share, for the costs of the management and disposal of nuclear
waste produced by co-owned nuclear power plants.

In both Finland and Sweden, the future costs of the final
disposal of spent fuel, the management of low and intermediate-
level radioactive waste and nuclear power plant decommissioning
are provided for by a state-established fund to which nuclear power
plant operators make annual contributions.

Sustainability risks

The Corporate Sustainability unit assesses sustainability risks
related to the Group's operations. Risks identified by Corporate
Sustainability are assessed by Divisions and mitigation actions for
applicable risks are defined as part of the annual planning process.
Assessment of environmental risks and preparedness to operate

in exceptional and emergency situations follows the requirements
set in ISO 14001 standard. The same approach based on the
requirements set in OHSAS 18001 standard applies to risks related to
occupational health and safety and actions in emergency situations.

Operating power and heat generation plants involves use,
storage and transportation of fuels and materials that can have
adverse effects on the environment and expose personnel to safety
risks.

Environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks as well as social
risks related to Fortum's activities are evaluated through supplier
pre-selection, internal and external audits and risk assessments.
Corrective and preventive actions are implemented when
necessary. EHS related risks together with social risks arising in
investments are evaluated in accordance with Fortum's Investment
Evaluation and Approval Procedure. Environmental risks and
liabilities in relation to past actions have been assessed and
provisions have been made for future remedial costs.

IT and information security risks

Fortum is exposed to hardware and software risks including cyber-
attacks. Information security risks are managed centrally by the
Corporate Security and IT functions. Group IT instructions set
procedures for reducing risks and managing IT and other information
security incidents. The main objective is to ensure high availability
and fast recovery of IT systems. Fortum’s IT community identifies the
\T-related operational risks that might threaten business continuity,
and the mitigating actions are planned accordingly. The management
of these risks is coordinated by Corporate IT, headed by the ClO, who.
also manages the IT architecture and strategy.
