Chief Executive Officer’s review

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S
REVIEW

We made good progress in 2012 toward improving our performance,
even as we dealt with continued volatile economic conditions. We are
on target to meet strategic objectives. And we are delivering the
projects that form the foundation of our aim to become the world’s
most competitive and innovative energy company.

Still, there is work to do. We are focused on further improving our
operating performance in key areas, such as oil and gas production
and internal processes that influence customer satisfaction.

Let me highlight some of 2012's milestones and achievements. Our
overall safety performance in 2012 matched that of 2011. And we
continued our strong focus on ensuring our facilities are safely run and
maintained. The Shell Sustainability Report has details on our safety
and environmental performance.

For 2012 our earnings on a current cost of supplies basis attributable
to shareholders were $27 billion. Cash flow from operating activities
was $46 billion and, excluding working capital movements, was
$43 billion. Net capital investment was $30 billion, as we build a
solid foundation for future growth.

We produced 3.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2012, up
3% from 2011 excluding the effect of divestments and exits, with
important contributions from our Pearl GTL plant in Qatar, which is
now ramped up, and the Pluto LNG Project in Australia, through our
participation in Woodside Petroleum Ltd. Equity LNG sales volumes of
20.2 million tonnes were up 7% compared with 2011.

In exploration, we continue to expand our portfolio, adding 120,000
square kilometres of new exploration acreage in 2012, including
positions in liquids-rich shales. We participated in seven notable
conventional exploration discoveries and appraisals, and 10
successful unconventional appraisals.

Harnessing innovation

We are building on our heritage as innovators and gaining public
recognition for our accomplishments. Shell was one of 50 innovation
leaders worldwide identified by the MIT Technology Review. We also
received industry awards for our Perdido deep-water project in the
Gulf of Mexico and our Prelude floating LNG project.

We continue to fine-tune our global network of technology centres to
support future business opportunities. That includes increasing our
capabilities in India and China. In November, we laid the foundation
stone for a new technology centre in Bangalore, India, which we aim
to build into a world-class technology hub.

Our Downstream business had a good operating performance for the
year, with reduced levels of unplanned downtime. We continued to
build on the strength of Shell’s brand in markets with growth potential.
In Brazil our Raizen biofuels joint venture is making good progress. In
its first full year of operation, the venture made a notable contribution
to Downstream earnings. Last year we broke ground on Shell’s seventh
lubricants blending plant in mainland China, to meet rising demand
there. And we also announced plans to build a blending plant in
Indonesia, another expanding market in Asia.

Our accomplishments in 2012 helped underpin Shell's strong track
record since 2010. Over the last three years, our earnings ona
current cost of supplies basis attributable to shareholders increased by
45% and our cash flow from operating activities increased by 69%.
Compared with our major competitors, over the past three years we
have delivered the highest rates of growth in earnings per share and
cash flow from operating activities.

Building our future

Looking to the future, the projects that will help drive growth are
advancing well. We have about 30 projects under construction. We
produced the first oil from the GumusutKakap project off the coast of
Malaysia and that will ramp up once a floating production facility is in
place. We added a new development phase to our Changbei tightgas
operation in China, adding nearly 1,700 square kilometres, as well as
agreeing with our partner, China National Petroleum Corporation, to
potentially develop the main reservoir.

In October, we cut the first steel for the hull of our ground-breaking
Prelude floating LNG project. In November, the hull for the Mars B
project was completed in South Korea and shipped to Texas for
installation in the Gulf of Mexico. And we took the final investment
decision on the Quest carbon capture and storage project associated
with our oil sands operations in Canada, which will reduce our
environmental footprint. In all, we took final investment decisions on
seven projects during the year.

With our progress in 2012, the growth agenda set out at the
beginning of the year is on track. It includes $175-200 billion of cash
flow from operating activities, excluding working capital movements,
for 2012-2015, assuming the Brent oil price remains in the range of
$80-100 per barrel and conditions for North American natural gas
and downstream margins improve relative to 2012. It also includes net
capital investment of $1 20-130 billion, and a competitive dividend for
shareholders.

Looking further ahead, we are considering about 30 additional
projects, giving us an attractive set of options for the longer term. We
are now more constrained by capital than by opportunities, which

allows us to focus resources where the potential for growth is greatest.

Gas leadership

Let me highlight one area where we are already industry leaders and
that has great potential for the future: integrated gas projects, which
include LNG and gas-to-liquids (GTI), such as our Pearl plant.
Integrated gas projects contributed approximately 40% of our total
earnings in 2012.

Integrated gas builds on our strengths in exploration and production,
our downstream expertise in creating and marketing high-value
products, and our know-how in managing huge projects. Growth will
come from Australia, where we have an additional 7 million tonnes
per year under construction. Longer term, we are studying projects
with capacity of another 20 million tonnes per year, so there is
significant growth potential.

North America is one region of opportunity. The shale gas revolution
there has unlocked vast resources that provide an attractively priced
feedstock. We will soon supply LNG for long-haul trucks in Canada.
‘And we have other LNG, GTL and chemicals options on the drawing
board.


--- Page 2 ---

In February 2013, we agreed to acquire part of Repsol S.A.’s LNG
portfolio, subject to regulatory approval and other conditions
precedent. This acquisition will extend our international LNG portfolio.

| expect our strength in integrated gas projects will be one of the
drivers of our earnings and cash flow in the coming decades.

Strategic priorities

As we push ahead with our strategy, we have taken a fresh look at
how we manage our portfolio. Going forward we are using a clear set
of strategic themes to drive our choices about investment, people and
innovation.

First we have our upstream and downstream “engines”, which are
mature businesses. They generate much of our cash flow. We will
continue to invest to keep them running smoothly and to extract
additional value.

Next we have our growth priorities, which are three areas of great
opportunity for us in the years ahead, thanks to our superior
technology and innovation. They are integrated gas, deep water and
resources plays, such as shale oil and gas.

Finally we have future opportunities for the longer term, including the
Arctic, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, and heavy oil. We also continue to
ramp up our conventional exploration activities, which we think is a
cost-effective way of identifying new resources.

To conclude, we are making good progress toward our objectives.
We continue to work hard to improve our operating performance. And
we have clear strategic priorities to drive growth and value for our
shareholders.

Business Review > Performance indicators

BUSINESS REVIEW

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Key performance indicators

Total shareholder return
2012 -0.2% 2011 17.1%

Total shareholder return (TSR) is the difference between the share price
at the start of the year and the share price at the end of the year, plus
gross dividends delivered during the calendar year (reinvested
quarterly), expressed as a percentage of the year-start share price. The
TSRs of major publicly traded oil and gas companies can be directly
compared, providing a way to determine how Shell is performing
against its industry peers.

Refinery and chemical plant availability
2012 92.9% 2011 91.2%

Refinery and chemical plant availability is the weighted average of the
actual uptime of plants as a percentage of their maximum possible
uptime. The weighting is based on the capital employed adjusted for
cash and non-current liabilities. It excludes downtime due to
uncontrollable factors, such as hurricanes. This indicator is a measure
of operational excellence of Shell’s Downstream manufacturing
facilities.

Net cash from operating acti:
2012 46

ties ($ billion)
2011 37

Net cash from operating activities is the total of all cash receipts and
payments associated with our sales of oil, gas, chemicals and other
products. The components that provide a reconciliation from income
for the period are listed in the “Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows”. This indicator reflects Shell's ability to generate cash for both
investment and distribution to shareholders.

Project delivery

2012 90% 2011 79%

Project delivery reflects Shell’s capability to complete major projects
on time and within budget on the basis of targets set in the annual
Business Plan. The set of projects consists of at least 20 Shell-operated
capital projects that are in the execution phase (post final investment

decision).

Production available for sale (thousand boe/d)
2012 3,262 2011 3,215

Production is the sum of all average daily volumes of unrefined oil and
natural gas produced for sale by Shell subsidiaries and the Shell share
of equity-accounted investments. The unrefined oil comprises crude oil,
natural gas liquids, synthetic crude oil and bitumen. The gas volume is
converted into equivalent barrels of oil to make the summation
possible. Changes in production have a significant impact on Shell’s
cash flow.

Equity sales of liquefied natural gas (million tonnes)
2012 20.2 2011 18.8

Equity sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a measure of the
operational performance of Shell’s Upstream business and the LNG
market demand.

Total recordable case frequency (injuries per million working hours)
2012 1.3 2011 1.2

Total recordable case frequency (TRCF) is the number of staff or
contractor injuries requiring medical treatment or time off for every
million hours worked. It is a standard measure of occupational safety.

Additional performance indicators

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012
Business Review > Performance indicators

Earnings on a current cost of supplies basis attributable to
Royal Dutch Shell ple shareholders ($ million)
2012 27,044 2011 28,625

Earnings per share on a current cost of supplies basis ($)
2012 4.32 2011 4.61

Earnings on a current cost of supplies (CCS) basis attributable to Royal
Dutch Shell ple shareholders is the income for the period, adjusted for
the after-tax effect of oil-price changes on inventory and
non-controlling interest. CCS earnings per share is calculated by
dividing CCS earnings attributable to shareholders by the average
number of shares outstanding. See page 16 and Note 2 to the
“Consolidated Financial Statements”.

Net capital investment ($ million)

2012 29,803 2011 23,503

Net capital investment is defined as capital expenditure, adjusted for:
proceeds from disposals; exploration expense excluding exploration
wells written off; investments in equity-accounted investments; and
leases and other items. See Notes 2 and 4 to the “Consolidated

Financial Statements” for further information.

Return on average capital employed
2012 12.7% 2011 15.9%

Return on average capital employed (ROACE) is defined as annual
income, adjusted for after-tax interest expense, as a percentage of
average capital employed during the year. Capital employed is the
sum of total equity and total debt. ROACE measures the efficiency of
Shell's utilisation of the capital that it employs and is a common
measure of business performance. See page 45.

Gearing
2012 9.2% 2011 13.1%

Gearing is defined as net debt (total debt less cash and cash
equivalents) as a percentage of total capital (net debt plus total
equity), at December 31. It is a measure of the degree to which Shell's
operations are financed by debt. For further information see Note 15

to the “Consolidated Financial Statements”.

Proved oil and gas reserves attributable to Royal Dutch Shell plc
shareholders (million boe)
2012 13,556 2011 14,250

Proved oil and gas reserves attributable to Royal Dutch Shell ple
shareholders are the total estimated quantities of oil and gas from
Shell subsidiaries (excluding reserves attributable to non-controlling
interest) and the Shell share of equity-accounted investments that
geoscience and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable
certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs, as
at December 31, under existing economic conditions, operating
methods and government regulations. Gas volumes are converted into
barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Reserves are crucial to an oil and gas
company, since they constitute the source of future production.
Reserves estimates are subject to change based on a wide variety of
factors, some of which are unpredictable. See “Risk factors”.

Operational spills of more than 100 kilograms
2012 204 2011 211

The operational spills indicator reflects the total number of incidents in
which 100 kilograms or more of oil or oil products were spilled by a
Shell-operated entity as a result of its operations. The number for 2011
was updated from 207 to reflect completion of investigations into
spills.

Employees (thousand)
2012 87 2011 90

The employees indicator consists of the annual average full-time
employee equivalent of the total number of people on full-time or part-
time employment contracts with Shell subsidiaries.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

History

From 1907 until 2005, Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and The
“Shell” Transport and Trading Company, p.l.c. were the two public
parent companies of a group of companies known collectively as the
“Royal Dutch/Shell Group”. Operating activities were conducted
through the subsidiaries of these parent companies. In 2005, Royal
Dutch Shell ple became the single parent company of Royal Dutch
Petroleum Company and of The “Shell” Transport and Trading
Company, p.l.c., now The Shell Transport and Trading Company
Limited.

Royal Dutch Shell plc (the Company) is a public limited company
registered in England and Wales and headquartered in The Hague,
the Netherlands.

Activities

Shell is one of the world’s largest independent oil and gas companies
in terms of market capitalisation, operating cash flow and oil and gas
production. We aim to sustain our strong operational performance
and continue our investments primarily in countries that have the
necessary infrastructure, expertise and remaining growth potential.
Such countries include Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, China,
Denmark, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway,
Oman, Qatar, Russia, the UK and the USA.

We are bringing new oil and gas supplies on-stream from major field
developments. We are also investing in growing our integrated gas
activities. For example, our Pearl GTL plant completed its ramp-up at
the end of 2012. In Downstream we seek innovative ways to market
LNG, for example through the use of LNG in the transport sector.

At the same time, we are exploring for oil and gas in prolific
conventional geological formations, such as those found in Australia,
Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. But we are also exploring for
hydrocarbons in formations, such as low-permeability reservoirs in the
USA, Australia, Canada and China, which can be developed by
fracturing techniques.

We also have a focused portfolio of refineries and chemical plants.
Furthermore, we are a leading biofuel producer and fuel retailer in
Brazil, through our Raizen joint venture. We have a strong retail
position not only in the major industrialised countries, but also in the
developing ones. The distinctive Shell pecten, (a trademark in use
since the early part of the twentieth century), and trademarks in which
the word Shell appears, support this marketing effort throughout the
world. A strong patent portfolio underlies the technology that we

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012
Business Review > Business overview

employ in our various businesses. In total, Shell currently has more
than 14,000 granted patents and pending patent applications.

Businesses

Upstream International manages the Upstream businesses outside the
Americas. It explores for and recovers crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids, liquefies and transports gas, and operates the
upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver oil and gas
to market. Upstream International also manages Shell’s LNG and GTL
businesses. Since January 2013, it manages its operations primarily
by line of business, with this structure overlaying individual country
organisations. This organisation is supported by activities such as
Exploration and New Business Development. Previously activities were
organised primarily by geographical location.

Upstream Americas manages the Upstream businesses in North and
South America. It explores for and recovers crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids, transports gas and operates the upstream and
midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver oil and gas to market.
Upstream Americas also extracts bitumen from oil sands that is
converted into synthetic crude oil. Additionally, it manages the
US-based wind business. It manages its operations by line of business,
supported by activities such as Exploration and New Business
Development.

Downstream manages Shell’s refining and marketing activities for oil
products and chemicals. These activities are organised into globally
managed classes of business, although some are managed regionally
or provided through support units. Refining includes manufacturing,
supply and shipping of crude oil. Marketing sells a range of products
including fuels, lubricants, bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
for home, transport and industrial use. Chemicals produces and
markets petrochemicals for industrial customers, including the raw
materials for plastics, coatings and detergents. Downstream also
trades Shell’s flow of hydrocarbons and other energy-related products,
supplies the Downstream businesses, governs the marketing and
trading of gas and power, and provides shipping services.
Additionally, Downstream oversees Shell's interests in alternative
energy (including biofuels but excluding wind) and CO, management.

Projects & Technology manages the delivery of Shell’s major projects
and drives the research and innovation to create technology solutions.
It provides technical services and technology capability covering both
Upstream and Downstream activities. It is also responsible for
providing functional leadership across Shell in the areas of safety and
environment, and contracting and procurement.

RISK FACTORS

The risks discussed below could have a material adverse effect
separately, or in combination, on our operational performance,
earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Accordingly, investors
should carefully consider these risks.

We are exposed to fluctuating prices of crude oil, natural gas,
oil products and chemicals.

Prices of oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals are affected by
supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Moreover, prices
for oil and gas can move independently from each other. Factors that
influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural
disasters, weather, political instability, conflicts, economic conditions
and actions by major oil-exporting countries. Price fluctuations could
have a material effect. For example, in a low oil and gas price
environment, Shell would generate less revenue from its Upstream
production, and as a result certain long-term projects might become
less profitable, or even incur losses. Additionally, low oil and gas
prices could result in the debooking of proved oil or gas reserves, if
they become uneconomic in this type of environment. Prolonged
periods of low oil and gas prices, or rising costs, could also result in
projects being delayed or cancelled, as well as in the impairment of
certain assets. In a high oil and gas price environment, we could
experience sharp increases in cost and under some production-sharing
contracts our entitlement to proved reserves would be reduced. Higher
prices could also reduce demand for our products. Lower demand for
our products might result in lower profitability, particularly in our
Downstream business.

Our ability to achieve strategic objectives depends on how
we react to competitive forces.

We face competition in each of our businesses. While we seek to
differentiate our products, many of them are competing in commodity-
type markets. If we do not manage our expenses adequately, our cost
efficiency could deteriorate and our unit costs may increase. This in
turn could erode our competitive position. Increasingly, we compete
with government-run oil and gas companies, particularly in seeking
access to oil and gas resources. Today, these government-run
companies control vastly greater quantities of oil and gas resources
than the major, publicly held oil and gas companies. Government-run
entities have access to significant resources and may be motivated by
political or other factors in their business decisions, which may harm
our competitive position or hinder our access to desirable projects.

As our business model involves trading and treasury risks,
we are affected by the global macroeconomic environment as
well as financial and commodity market conditions.

Shell subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments are subject to
differing economic and financial market conditions throughout the
world. Political or economic instability affects such markets. Shell uses
debt instruments such as bonds and commercial paper to raise
significant amounts of capital. Should our access to debt markets
become more difficult, the potential impact on our liquidity could have
an adverse effect on our operations. Commodity trading is an
important component of our supply and distribution function. Trading
and treasury risks include, among others, exposure fo movements in
commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates,
counterparty default and various operational risks (see also page 83).
Asa global company doing business in more than 70 countries, we
are exposed to changes in currency values and exchange controls.
While we undertake some currency hedging, we do not do so for all of
our activities. See Notes 6 and 21 to the “Consolidated Financial

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 | 13
Business Review > Risk factors

Statements”. Shell has significant financial exposure to the euro and
could be materially affected by a significant change in its value or any
structural changes to the European Union (EU) or the European
Economic and Monetary Union affecting the euro. While we do not
have significant direct exposure to sovereign debt, it is possible that
our pariners and customers may have exposure which could impair
their ability to meet their obligations to us. Therefore, a sovereign debt
downgrade or default could have a material adverse effect on Shell.

Our future hydrocarbon production depends on the delivery
of large and complex projects, as well as on our ability to
replace proved oil and gas reserves.

We face numerous challenges in developing capital projects,
especially large ones. Challenges include uncertain geology, frontier
conditions, the existence and availability of necessary technology and
engineering resources, availability of skilled labour, project delays,
expiration of licences and potential cost overruns, as well as technical,
fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions. These challenges are
particularly relevant in certain developing and emerging market
countries, such as Iraq and Kazakhstan, and in frontier areas, such as
the Arctic. Such potential obstacles may impair our delivery of these
projects, as well as our ability to fulfil related contractual commitments.
Future oil and gas production will depend on our access fo new
proved reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments
and other owners of proved reserves and acquisitions, as well as
developing and applying new technologies and recovery processes to
existing fields and mines. Failure to replace proved reserves could
result in lower future production.

An erosion of our business reputation would have a negative
impact on our brand, our ability to secure new resources and
our licence to operate.

Shell is one of the world’s leading energy brands, and its brand and
reputation are important assets. The Shell General Business Principles
and Code of Conduct govern how Shell and its individual companies
conduct their affairs. It is a challenge for us to ensure that all
employees and contractors, well above 100,000 in total, comply with



--- Page 9 ---

Business Review > Risk factors

the principles. Failure — real or perceived — to follow these principles,
or other real or perceived failures of governance or regulatory
compliance, could harm our reputation. This could impact our licence
to operate, damage our brand, harm our ability to secure new
resources and limit our ability to access the capital market.

Our future performance depends on the successful
development and deployment of new technologies.
Technology and innovation are essential to Shell. If we do not develop
the right technology, do not have access to it or do not deploy it
effectively, the delivery of our strategy and our licence to operate may
be adversely affected. We operate in environments where the most
advanced technologies are needed. While these technologies are
regarded as safe for the environment with today’s knowledge, there is
always the possibility of unknown or unforeseeable environmental
impacts that could harm our reputation, licence to operate or expose
us to litigation or sanctions.

Rising climate change concerns could lead to additional
regulatory measures that may result in project delays and
higher costs.

In the future, in order to help meet the world’s energy demand, we
expect our production to rise and more of our production to come from
unconventional sources than at present. Energy intensity of production
of oil and gas from unconventional sources can be higher than that of
production from conventional sources. Therefore, it is expected that
both the CO, intensity of our production, as well as our absolute
Upstream COz emissions, will increase as our business grows.
Examples of such developments are our expansion of oil sands
activities in Canada and our gas-to-liquids project in Qatar.
Additionally, as production from Iraq increases, we expect that CO2
emissions from flaring will rise. We are working with our partners on
finding ways to capture the gas that is flared. Over time, we expect
that a growing share of our CO2 emissions will be subject to
regulation and carry a cost. If we are unable to find economically
viable, as well as publicly acceptable, solutions that reduce our CO,
emissions for new and existing projects or products, we may incur
additional costs, delayed projects or reduced production in certain
projects.

Moreover, continued public and political attention to climate change
concerns, including existing and future regulatory frameworks to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, could result in increasing
production costs, lengthening project implementation times and
reducing demand for hydrocarbons.

The nature of our operations exposes us to a wide range of
health, safety, security and environment risks.

The health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) risks to which we
are potentially exposed cover a wide spectrum, given the geographic
range, operational diversity and technical complexity of Shell’s daily
operations. We have operations, including oil and gas production,
transport and shipping of hydrocarbons, and refining, in difficult
geographies or climate zones, as well as environmentally sensitive
regions, such as the Arctic or maritime environments, especially in
deep water. These and other operations expose us to the risk, among
others, of major process safety incidents, effects of natural disasters,
social unrest, personal health and safety lapses, and crime. If a major
HSSE risk materialises, such as an explosion or hydrocarbon spill, this
could result in injuries, loss of life, environmental harm, disruption to
business activities and, depending on their cause and severity,
material damage to our reputation and eventually loss of licence to
operate. In certain circumstances, liability could be imposed without
regard to Shell's fault in the matter. Requirements governing HSSE

matters often change and are likely to become more stringent over
time. We could incur significant additional costs in the future
complying with such requirements or as a result of violations of, or
liabilities under, HSSE laws and regulations, such as fines, penalties,
clean-up costs and third-party claims.

Shell mainly self-insures its risk exposures.
Shell insurance subsidiaries provide insurance coverage to Shell
entities, generally up to $1.15 billion per event and usually limited to
Shell’s percentage interest in the relevant entity. The type and extent of
the coverage provided is equal to that which is otherwise
commercially available in the third-party insurance market. While from
time to time the insurance subsidiaries may seek reinsurance for some
of their risk exposures, such reinsurance would not provide any
material coverage in the event of an incident like BP Deepwater
Horizon. Similarly, in the event of a material environmental incident,
there would be no material proceeds available from third-party
insurance companies to meet Shell's obligations.

An erosion of the business and operating environment in
Nigeria would adversely impact Shell.

We face various risks in our Nigerian operations. These risks include:
security issues surrounding the safety of our people, host communities,
and operations; our ability to enforce existing contractual rights;
limited infrastructure; and potential legislation that could increase our
taxes or costs of operation. The Nigerian government is contemplating
new legislation to govern the petroleum industry which, if passed into
law, would likely have a significant adverse impact on Shell’s existing
and future activities in that country.

We operate in more than 70 countries, with differing degrees
of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes us toa
wide range of political developments that could result in
changes to laws and regulations. In addition, Shell

sub: s and equity-accounted investments face the risk
of litigation and disputes worldwide.

Developments in politics, laws and regulations can - and do — affect
our operations. Potential developments include: forced divestment of
assets; expropriation of property; cancellation or forced renegotiation
of contract rights; additional taxes including windfall taxes, restrictions
on deductions and retroactive tax claims; import and export
restrictions; foreign exchange controls; and changing environmental
regulations and disclosure requirements. Certain governments, states
and regulatory bodies have, in the opinion of Shell, exceeded their
constitutional authority by attempting unilaterally to amend or cancel
existing agreements or arrangements; by failing to honour existing
contractual commitments; and by seeking to adjudicate disputes
between private litigants. As a result of the financial crisis, US
regulators have adopted regulations that require disclosure of
information on payments to governments that we believe is immaterial
to investors, but that could compromise confidential commercial
arrangements and create conflicting legal requirements. EU regulators
have also proposed similar regulations. Additional regulations
targeted at the financial sector could have unintended consequences
for our trading, treasury and pension operations. In our Upstream
activities these developments can and do affect land tenure, re-writing
of leases, entitlement to produced hydrocarbons, production rates,
royalties and pricing. Parts of our Downstream activities are subject to
price controls in some countries. From time to time, cultural and
political factors play a role in unprecedented and unanticipated
judicial outcomes that could adversely affect Shell. If we do not comply
with policies and regulations, it may result in regulatory investigations,
litigation and ultimately sanctions.



--- Page 10 ---

Our operations expose us to social instability, terrorism, acts
of war, piracy and government sanctions that could have an
adverse impact on our business.

As seen recently in north Africa and the Middle East, social and civil
unrest, both within the countries in which we operate and
internationally, can - and does — affect Shell. Potential developments
that could impact our business include international sanctions, conflicts
including war, acts of political or economic terrorism and acts of
piracy on the high seas, as well as civil unrest and local security
concerns that threaten the safe operation of our facilities and transport
of our products. For example, EU sanctions have prohibited us from
producing oil and gas in Syria, and the USA and the EU have imposed
sanctions relating to transactions involving Iran and Sudan, among
other countries. If such risks materialise, they could result in injuries
and disruption to business activities.

We rely heavily on information technology systems for our
operations.

The operation of many of our business processes depends on the
availability of information technology (IT) systems. Our IT systems are
increasingly concentrated in terms of geography, number of systems,
and key contractors supporting the delivery of IT services. Shell, like
many other multinational companies, has been the target of attempts to
gain unauthorised access through the internet to our IT systems,
including more sophisticated attempts often referred to as advanced
persistent threat. Shell seeks to detect and investigate all such security
incidents, aiming to prevent their recurrence. Disruption of critical IT
services, or breaches of information security, could have adverse
consequences for Shell.

We have substantial pension commitments, whose funding is
subject to capital market risks.

Liabilities associated with defined benefit plans can be significant, as
can the cash funding of such plans; both depend on various
assumptions. Volatility in capital markets, and the resulting
consequences for investment performance and interest rates, may
result in significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. In
case of a shortfall, Shell might be required to make substantial cash
contributions, depending on the applicable local regulations.

The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves
subjective judgements based on available information and
the application of complex rules, so subsequent downward
adjustments are possible.

The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective
judgements and determinations based on available geological,
technical, contractual and economic information. The estimate may
change because of new information from production or drilling
activities, or changes in economic factors, including changes in the
price of oil or gas and changes in the taxation or regulatory policies of
host governments. It may also alter because of acquisitions and
divestments, new discoveries, and extensions of existing fields and
mines, as well as the application of improved recovery techniques.
Published proved oil and gas reserves estimates may also be subject to
correction due to errors in the application of published rules and
changes in guidance. Any downward adjustment would indicate lower
future production volumes.

Many of our major projects and operations are conducted in
joint ventures or associates. This may reduce our degree of
control, as well as our ability to identify and manage risks.
A significant share of our capital is invested in joint ventures or
associates. In cases where we are not the operator we have limited
influence over, and control of, the behaviour, performance and costs

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012
Business Review > Risk factors

of operation of joint ventures or associates. Despite not having control,
we could still be exposed to the risks associated with these operations.
For example, our partners or members of a joint venture or an
associate (particularly local partners in developing countries) may not
be able to meet their financial or other obligations to the projects,
threatening the viability of a given project.

Violations of antitrust and competition law carry fines and
expose us or our employees to criminal sanctions and civil
suits.

Antitrust and competition laws apply to Shell subsidiaries and equity-
accounted investments in the vast majority of countries in which we do
business. Shell subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments have
been fined for violations of antitrust and competition law. These
include a number of fines by the European Commission Directorate-
General for Competition (DG COMP). Due to the DG COMP’s fining
guidelines, any future conviction of Shell subsidiaries or equity-
accounted investments for violation of EU competition law could result
in larger fines. Violation of antitrust laws is a criminal offence in many
countries, and individuals can be either imprisoned or fined.
Furthermore, it is now common for persons or corporations allegedly
injured by antitrust violations to sue for damages.

Shell is currently subject to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
with the U.S. Department of Justice for violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

In 2010, a Shell subsidiary agreed to a Deferred Prosecution
Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which arose in
connection with its use of the freightforwarding firm Panalpina. Also,
the Company has consented to a Cease and Desist Order from the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for violations of the
record keeping and internal control provisions of the FCPA as a result
of another Shell subsidiary’s violation of the FCPA, which also arose in
connection with the use of Panalpina in Nigeria. The DPA requires
Shell to continue to implement a compliance and ethics programme
designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws throughout Shell’s operations. The DPA
also requires the Company to report to the DOJ, promptly, any
credible evidence of questionable or corrupt payments. Any violations
of the DPA, or of the SEC’s Cease and Desist Order, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company’s Articles of Association determine the
jurisdiction for shareholder disputes. This might limit
shareholder remed
Our Articles of Association generally require that all disputes between
our shareholders in such capacity and the Company or our
subsidiaries (or our Directors or former Directors) or between the
Company and our Directors or former Directors be exclusively
resolved by arbitration in The Hague, the Netherlands, under the Rules
of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Our Articles
of Association also provide that, if this provision is for any reason
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the dispute may only be
brought to the courts of England and Wales. Accordingly, the ability
of shareholders to obtain monetary or other relief, including in respect
of securities law claims, may be determined in accordance with these
provisions. See “Corporate governance” for further information.

Earnings 2012-2010

On average, 2012 realised liquids and gas prices remained stable
compared with 2011. The increase in Asia-Pacific realised gas prices
approximately offset the decrease in Americas realised gas prices.
Average realised synthetic crude oil prices for 2012 decreased
compared with 2011. Oil and gas production available for sale in
2012 was 3,262 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d),
compared with 3,215 thousand boe/d in 2011. Excluding the impact
of divestments and exits, production volumes were 3% higher than in
2011. Refining margins were generally higher in 2012 than in 2011
in key refining hubs, except Asia. This increase was driven by the
closure of some refining capacity and then refinery outages later in the
year, partly offset by an unfavourable economic environment and
geopolitical tensions.

Earnings on a current cost of supplies basis attributable to
shareholders in 2012 were $27,044 million, 6% lower than in 2011,
which, in turn, were 54% higher than in 2010.

In 2012, Upstream earnings were $22,162 million, compared with
$24,455 million in 2011 and $15,935 million in 2010. The 9%
decrease from 2011 to 2012 reflected higher depreciation charges,
increased operating and exploration expenses, lower gains
associated with the fair-value accounting of certain gas and derivative
contracts and additional tax charges, partly offset by higher
contributions from our integrated gas activities (LNG and GTL). In
2011, earnings increased by 53% compared with 2010, reflecting
higher realised oil and gas prices, together with higher equity LNG
sales volumes, increased trading contributions and a reduced level of
impairment, partly offset by higher operating expenses, lower
production volumes and increased taxes.

Downstream earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis
(CCS earnings). On this basis, the purchase price of the volumes sold
during a period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same
period, after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings
therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory
valuation. Downstream earnings in 2012 were $5,350 million,

compared with $4,289 million in 2011 and $2,950 million in 2010.
The 25% increase from 2011 to 2012 reflected higher realised refining
margins, lower operating expenses and a reduced level of impairment.
These items were partly offset by lower trading contributions, lower
Chemicals earnings, lower divestment gains and lower gains associated
with the fair-value accounting of commodity derivatives. Earnings
increased between 2010 and 2011 as a result of higher chemical
margins, increased trading contributions and lower operating expenses,
partly offset by a larger loss in refining and lower sales volumes.

Balance sheet and net capital investment

Shell's strategy to invest in the development of major growth projects
primarily in Upstream, explains the most significant changes to the
balance sheet in 2012. Property, plant and equipment increased by
$20 billion. Net capital investment was $30 billion, 27% higher than
in 2011; see Note 4 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements”. The
effect of net capital investment on property, plant and equipment was
partly offset by depreciation, depletion and amortisation of $15
billion.

Of the 2012 net capital investment, approximately 85% related to
Upstream projects, providing growth over the long term. They include
multibillion dollar, integrated facilities that are expected to provide
significant cash flows in the coming decades. In 2012, equity
attributable to Royal Dutch Shell ple shareholders increased by

$19 billion, to $188 billion, principally as a result of increased
retained earnings.

Gearing was 9.2% at the end of 2012, compared with 13.1% at the
end of 2011. The change reflects the increase in total equity and in
cash and cash equivalents.

Market overview

We estimate that global economic growth weakened to 3.2% in
2012, down from 3.9% the previous year, largely as a result of the
recession in the eurozone and a slowdown in most emerging markets.
In our view, global economic growth in 2013 is estimated to be 3.4%,
below the annual average of 3.8% of the last 10 years.

Within the eurozone, uncertainty and austerity measures weighed
heavily on economic sentiment and consumer and business spending.
In January 2013, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected the
eurozone economy to have contracted by 0.4% in 2012. According to
the same projections, growth of gross domestic product (GDP] in
China slowed to 7.8% in 2012, down from 9.3% in 2011, mainly due
to lower export growth and slower domestic demand growth. Other
emerging economies including Brazil, Russia and India also had lower
GDP growth rates. Brazil decelerated most to a rate of 1.0% in 2012,
down from 2.7% in 2011. The USA was a notable exception in this
environment; its GDP growth rate accelerated in 2012 to 2.3%,
compared with 1.8% in 2011.

Reflecting the state of the global economy, global oil demand rose by
0.9% (0.8 million b/d) in 2012 according to the International Energy
Agency December 2012 Oil Market Report. A 1.2 million b/d
demand increase in emerging economies offset a decline of

0.4 million b/d in developed economies. We estimate that global gas
demand grew by about 3% in 2012 with approximately two-thirds of
that growth coming from countries outside the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Demand grew
strongest in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and North America, while
demand in Europe contracted by an estimated 1% overall, and
particularly in electricity generation.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES
The following table provides an overview of the main oil and gas price
markers that Shell is exposed to:

OIL AND GAS AVERAGE INDUSTRY PRICES [A]

2012. 2011-2010
Brent ($/b} 111.67, 111.26 79.50
West Texas Intermediate ($/b) 94.13 95.04 79.45
Henry Hub ($/MMBtu) 2.76 4.01 4.40
UK National Balancing Point (pence/therm) 59.74 56.35 42.12
Japan Customs-cleared Crude ($/b} 114.91 109.10 79.17

IA] Yearly average prices are based on daily spot prices.

The Brent crude oil price, the international crude-oil benchmark,
traded in a range of $88-128 per barrel during 2012, ending the
year at $110 per barrel. Both the Brent and the West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) average crude oil prices for 2012 were little
changed compared with 2011. WTI continued to trade at a significant
discount to Brent due to production in the US mid-continent exceeding
pipeline capacity to clear the growing volumes. This resulted in crude
oil being transported to the Gulf coast by less efficient modes of
transport, such as rail, depressing prices in landlocked areas, such as
Cushing, Oklahoma, where W1I is delivered.

Unlike crude-oil pricing, which is global in nature, gas prices vary
significantly from region to region.

In the USA, the average natural gas price at Henry Hub was 31%
lower in 2012 compared with 2011, and traded in a range of
$1.91-3.90 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). Domestic
production increased strongly, particularly from onshore gas, which
more than offset increased demand, and led to lower prices. The daily
Henry Hub spot price briefly dropped below $2 per MMBrtu in April
following an unusually warm winter, meaning that inventories were
high and production had to be discouraged. The daily price recovered
to a monthly average of $2.50 per MMBtu in May, and continued to
recover due to warmer than normal summer temperatures stimulating
gas-fired power generation demand due to its price advantage over
coal.

In Europe, prices rose. In the UK, the average price at the UK National
Balancing Point was 6% higher compared with 2011. In continental
Europe, price increases at the main gas trading hubs in Belgium,
Germany and the Netherlands were similar to those at the UK National
Balancing Point. These prices reflect a tightening of LNG markets and
higher prices in Asia-Pacific. The use of oil-indexed gas pricing is
decreasing in continental Europe, with many natural gas contracts now
including spot market pricing as a major component.

We also produce and sell natural gas in regions whose supply,
demand and regulatory circumstances differ markedly from those in
the USA or Europe. Long-term contracted LNG prices in Asia-Pacific
are predominantly indexed to the price of Japan Customs-cleared
Crude (JCC). In Japan, LNG import contracts have historically been
indexed to the JCC benchmark, as burning crude and fuel oil is the
alternative option for Japanese power utilities.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION
The range of possible future crude oil and natural gas prices used in
project and portfolio evaluations within Shell is determined after an
assessment of short-, medium- and long-term price drivers under
different sets of assumptions. Historical analysis, trends and statistical
volatility are considered in this assessment, as are analyses of possible
future economic conditions, geopolitics, actions by the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), supply costs and the

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012
Business Review > Summary of results and strategy

balance of supply and demand. Sensitivity analyses are used to test
the impact of low-price drivers, such as economic weakness, and high-
price drivers, such as strong economic growth and low investment
levels in new production capacity. Short-term events, such as relatively
warm winters or cool summers affecting demand, and supply
disruptions due to weather or politics, contribute to price volatility.

We expect oil and gas prices to remain volatile. For the purposes of
making investment decisions, generally we test the economic
performance of long-term projects against price ranges of $70-110 per
barrel for Brent oil and $3-5 per MMBtu for gas at Henry Hub. As part of
our normal business practice, the range of prices used for this purpose is
subject to review and change, and was last updated in the fourth quarter
of 2012.

REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKET TRENDS
Industry refining margins were generally higher in 2012 than in 2011
in key refining hubs, except Asia. Support for margins in 2012 came
from refinery closures in North America and Europe at the beginning
of the year, and from unplanned refinery outages later in the year.
Some demand growth, especially around the summer holiday driving
season in the USA, also contributed, although the economic
environment and geopolitical tensions dampened further gains. In the
USA a surge of light sweet crude supply and infrastructure bottlenecks
also acted to support margins.

Akey driver of refining margins in 2013 is expected to be middle
distillate demand growth with some support from gasoline during the
middle of the year. The overall outlook remains uncertain, with the
economic environment remaining fragile, a structural overcapacity in
global refining, and geopolitical tensions in some regions that could
lead to supply disruptions.

Industry chemical margins in Europe and Asia during 2012 were
lower than in 2011 due to declining demand in Europe and lower
demand growth in Asia. US ethane cracker margins rose significantly
due to increased supply of natural gas liquids, and the wide price
differential between crude oil and natural gas. The outlook for
petrochemicals in 2013 remains uncertain as demand is strongly
correlated to economic growth.

Strategy and outlook

STRATEGY
Our strategy seeks to reinforce our position as a leader in the oil and
gas industry, while helping to meet global energy demand in a
responsible way. We aim to create competitive returns for
shareholders. Safety and environmental and social responsibility are
at the heart of our activities.

Intense competition exists for access to upstream resources and to new
downstream markets. But we believe that our technology, project
delivery capability and operational excellence will remain key
differentiators for our businesses. We expect about 80% of our capital
investment in 2013 to be in our Upstream businesses.

In Upstream we focus on exploration for new liquids and natural gas
reserves, and on developing major new projects where our technology
and know-how add value to the resources holders.

We focus on a series of strategic themes, each requiring distinctive
technologies and risk management:

= our upstream and downstream “engines” are strongly cash-
generative, mature businesses, which will underpin our financial

Business Review > Summary of results and strategy

performance to at least the end of this decade. Here we only make
investments in selective growth positions, and we apply Shell’s
distinctive technology and operating performance to extend the
productive lives of our assets and to enhance their profitability;

our growth priorities are in three strategic themes, namely integrated

gas, deep water and resources plays such as shale oil and gas.
These will provide our medium-term growth, and we expect them to
become core engines in the future. Here, we use the advantages of
Shell’s technological know-how and global scale to unlock highly
competitive resources positions; and

our future opportunities include the Arctic, Iraq, Kazakhstan,
Nigeria, and heavy oil, where we believe large reserves positions
could potentially become available, with the pace of development
driven by market and local operating conditions.

Meeting the growing demand for energy worldwide in ways that
minimise environmental and social impact is a major challenge for the
global energy industry. We aim to improve energy efficiency in our
own operations, support customers in managing their energy
demands, and continue to research and develop technologies that
increase efficiency and reduce emissions in liquids and natural gas
production.

Our commitment to technology and innovation continues to be at the
core of our strategy. As energy projects become more complex and
more technically demanding, we believe our engineering expertise
will be a deciding factor in the growth of our businesses. Our key
strengths include the development and application of technology, the
financial and project-management skills that allow us to deliver large
field development projects, and the management of integrated value
chains.

We aim to leverage our diverse and global business portfolio and
customer-focused businesses built around the strength of the Shell brand.

OUTLOOK

We continuously seek to improve our operating performance, with an
emphasis on health, safety and environment, asset performance and
operating costs. Asset sales are a key element of our strategy —
improving our capital efficiency by focusing our investment on the
most attractive growth opportunities. Sale of non-core assets in 2010-
2012 generated $21 billion in divestment proceeds. Exits from further
positions in 2013 are expected to generate up to $3 billion in
divestment proceeds. We have initiatives underway that are expected
to improve Shell's integrated Downstream business, focusing on the
profitability of our portfolio and growth potential.

In early 2012, Shell set out a new growth agenda, to deliver
$175-200 billion of cash flow from operations excluding working
capital movements for 2012-2015 in aggregate, some 30-50% higher
than in 2008-2011. This assumes that the Brent oil price is in the
range of $80-100 per barrel and conditions for North American
natural gas and downstream margins improve relative to 2012. This
cash flow is to finance a 2012-2015 expected net capital investment
programme of $120-130 billion, an increase of some 10-20%
compared with the 2008-2011 level, and fund a competitive dividend
for shareholders. Shell is on track to deliver these targets.

In Upstream we have the potential to reach an average production of
some 4.0 million boe/d in 2017-2018, compared with 3.3 million
boe/d in 2012. Shell's strategy in Upstream is designed to drive
financial growth, with production growth regarded as a proxy for this
over the long term. Our 2017-2018 production potential will be
driven by the timing of investment decisions and the near-term
macroeconomic outlook, and assumes some 250 thousand boe/d of

expected asset sales and licence expiries from 2011 to 2017-2018. In
Downstream we evaluate selective growth opportunities in chemicals,
biofuels and growth markets.

Shell has built up a substantial portfolio of options for a next wave of
growth. This portfolio has been designed to capture energy price
upside and manage Shell’s exposure to industry challenges from cost
inflation and political risk. Key elements of these opportunities are in
global exploration and established resources positions in the Gulf of
Mexico, North American tight gas, liquids-rich shales and Australian
LNG. These projects are part of a portfolio that has the potential to
underpin production growth to the end of this decade. Shell is working
to mature these projects, with an emphasis on financial returns.

The statements in this Strategy and outlook section do not take into
account the impact of the recently announced agreement to acquire
part of Repsol S.A.’s LNG portfolio. See page 137.

The statements in this Strategy and outlook section, including those
related to our growth strategies and our expected or potential future
cash flow from operations, net capital investment and production, are
based on management's current expectations and certain material
assumptions and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially
from those expressed or implied herein. See page 3 and “Risk
factors”.

Proved reserves and production

Shell subsidiaries’ and the Shell share of equity-accounted investments’
estimated net proved oil and gas reserves are summarised in the table
on page 28 and are set out in more detail in “Supplementary
information — oil and gas (unaudited)”.

In 2012, Shell added 542 million boe of proved reserves before
taking into account production, of which 408 million boe came from
Shell subsidiaries and 134 million boe from the Shell share of
equity-accounted investments. These additions were negatively
impacted by lower commodity prices (431 million boe] and
divestments (74 million boe).

In 2012, total oil and gas production available for sale was
1,194 million boe. An additional 40 million boe were produced and
consumed in operations. Production available for sale from
subsidiaries was 825 million boe with an additional 30 million boe
consumed in operations. The Shell share of the production available
for sale of equity-accounted investments was 369 million boe with an
additional 10 million boe consumed in operations.

Accordingly, after taking into account total production, there was a
decrease of 692 million boe in proved reserves, comprising

447 million boe from subsidiaries and 245 million boe from the Shell
share of equity-accounted investments.

Research and development

Technology and innovation provide ways for Shell to stand apart from
its competitors. They help our current businesses perform, and they
make our future businesses possible. We have been spending more
than any other international oil and gas company to research and
develop innovative technology — more than $1 billion annually since
2007. In 2012, research and development (R&D) expenses were
$1,314 million, compared with $1,125 million in 2011 and $1,019
million in 2010.

Sustained investment in our key technologies continues to deliver
results. In 2012, we launched new fuels and lubricant formulations


--- Page 14 ---

meeting specific customer needs for improved efficiency and better
performance. We also began construction of what is likely to be the
world’s first floating LNG facility, more than 480 metres long and six
times heavier than a fully loaded aircraft carrier. The facility is
designed to produce natural gas from the Prelude field offshore
Australia, cool it into a liquid and pump it onto LNG tankers — all done
at sea. The idea was born and developed entirely within Shell as part
of an innovation-stimulating programme called GameChanger. Also in
2012, Shell committed itself to design, build and operate the world’s
first commercial-scale facility to capture and store safely underground
CO, emissions of an oil-sands project. The facility, based near
Edmonton, Canada, will help develop Shell’s CO, capture technology.

The development of Shell technology is based on the needs of our
customers and partners, and is intrinsically linked to our strategic
objectives. In 2013, the key objectives of our R&D programme will
remain unchanged. We will continue to focus strongly on technologies
supporting our various businesses. For example: novel seismic
acquisition systems that help reveal previously unnoticed geological
details; methods based on the application of chemicals, heat or solvent
gases to increase the amount of oil ultimately recovered from fields;
and biofuels derived from non-edible plants or crop waste. We also
continue to work on technologies to reduce the environmental footprint
of our operations and products.

We remain committed to further shortening the time taken for
technology to move from the laboratory to deployment in the field. Our
technology portfolio will maintain a healthy balance of new and
mature developments. That will mean an increase in the number of
proposed concepts, more rapid termination of less promising projects
and increasing focus on larger-scale field tests and demonstrations.
Our single, integrated R&D organisation will continue to bring
together in-house technology development with external scientific,
engineering and commercial partnerships. Such partnering helps to
ensure a healthy influx of new ideas and to speed up their realisation.

Overview

Our Upstream businesses explore for and extract crude oil and natural
gas, often in joint ventures with international and national oil and gas
companies. This includes the extraction of bitumen from mined oil
sands which we convert into synthetic crude oil. We liquefy natural
gas by cooling and transport the liquefied natural gas (LNG) to
customers across the world. We also convert natural gas to liquids
(GTL) to provide high quality fuels and other products, and we market
and trade natural gas (including LNG) in support of our Upstream
businesses.

Business conditions

According to the International Energy Agency, oil demand in 2012
increased by 0.9% (0.8 million b/d). Demand was impacted by
further weakened global economic growth in 2012, largely as a result
of a recession in the eurozone and a slowdown in most emerging
markets. Increased production, particularly in North America, Libya
and Iraq, helped meet this demand, partly offset by a fall in supply
from some Middle Eastern countries, especially Iran and Syria. The
average Brent crude oil price in 2012 was $112 per barrel, slightly
higher than in 2011.

Demand for gas, especially LNG, was robust in markets east of Suez.
This was driven by economic growth across Asia-Pacific and nuclear
power generation capacity still being offline following Japan's natural
disaster in March 2011. In Europe, gas demand was lower as a result of
the ongoing recession and competition from cheap coal imports from the
USA. Continued high levels of supply and warmer than normal weather
at the beginning of 2012 weakened gas prices in North America by
approximately 30% compared with 2011.

Earnings 2012-2011

Segment earnings of $22,162 million included a net gain of

$2,137 million, mainly related to gains on divestments, partly offset by
impairments for natural gas assets in the USA, net tax charges and
decommissioning provisions. Segment earnings in 2011 of

$24,455 million included a net gain of $3,855 million, mainly related
to gains on divestments, the fair-value accounting of certain gas and
derivative contracts, and the cost impact of the US offshore drilling
moratorium. All gains and losses identified above relate to items that
individually exceed $50 million.

Compared with 2011, segment earnings, excluding the items identified
above, benefited from the increased contribution of integrated gas
activities (LNG and GTL), reflecting the ramp-up of the Pearl GTL plant in
Qatar, higher realised LNG prices as well as increased LNG trading
contributions and equity LNG sales volumes. Earnings also reflected
higher realised gas prices outside the Americas. These items were more
than offset by reduced contributions from the Americas, mainly as a
result of higher depreciation, increased operating expenses, higher
exploration expenses and lower realised gas prices.

During 2012, our earnings in the Americas were $512 million,
excluding the related items identified at the beginning of the earnings
section. However, our Americas onshore gas business reported a loss,
mainly due to low North American gas prices, and higher
depreciation and exploration costs. This was more than offset by
earnings from our deep-water and heavy oil production.

Realised global liquids prices were 1% higher than in 2011. In
Canada, realised synthetic crude oil prices were 11% lower than in
2011. Realised global natural gas prices were 1% higher than in
2011, with a 31% decrease in the Americas and a 9% increase
outside the Americas.

In 2012, production was 3,262 thousand boe/d compared with
3,215 thousand boe/d in 2011. Liquids production was down 2%
and natural gas production increased by 5% compared with 2011.
Natural gas represented 50% of total production in 2012.
Approximately 18% of our natural gas production in 2012 was in the
Americas. Excluding the impact of divestments and exits, production
volumes in 2012 were 3% higher than in 2011.

New field startups and the continuing ramp-up of new projects, in
particular the ramp-up of the Pearl GTL plant in Qatar and the Pluto
LNG plant in Australia (Shell indirect interest 20.8%), contributed
some 225 thousand boe/d to production in 2012, which more than
offset the impact of field declines.

Equity LNG sales volumes in 2012 were a record of 20.2 million
tonnes, 7% higher than in 2011. The increase mainly came from the
first full year of operations for Qatargas 4, the startup of the Pluto
LNG plant in the second quarter of 2012, and the continued strong
operational performance of the Sakhalin-2 LNG plant.

Earnings 2011-2010

Segment earnings in 2011 of $24,455 million included a net gain of
$3,855 million as described above. Segment earnings in 2010 of
$15,935 million included a net gain of $1,493 million, mainly related
to gains on divestments, partly offset by asset impairments, the


--- Page 16 ---

fair-value accounting of certain gas contracts and the cost impact of
the US offshore drilling moratorium. All gains and losses identified
above relate to items that individually exceed $50 million.

Excluding these gains and losses, segment earnings in 2011 were
43% higher than in 2010, driven by continuing portfolio optimisation,
higher realised oil, natural gas and LNG prices, higher equity LNG
sales volumes and higher trading contributions, partly offset by higher
operating expenses, mainly reflecting the start-up of new projects,
lower production volumes and increased taxes.

Net capital investment

Net capital investment was $25 billion in 2012, compared with

$19 billion in 2011 and $21 billion in 2010. Capital investment in
2012 was $31 billion (of which $14 billion was exploration
expenditure, including acquisitions of unproved properties). Divestment
proceeds were $6 billion in 2012.

Portfolio actions and business development

In Australia we increased our interest in the West Browse joint venture
to 35% and in the East Browse joint venture to 25% in an exchange
with Chevron for our 33.3% interest in Clio-Acme plus cash of
approximately $0.5 billion.

Also in Australia we formed a joint venture (Shell interest 82%) with
Nexus Energy and Osaka Gas to operate the Crux gas and
condensate field.

In Norway we acquired BP’s 18.4% interest in the offshore Draugen
field for a consideration of $0.2 billion. Shell is already the operator
of the field and this transaction brought Shell's interest to 44.6%.

In the UK we acquired 75% of Hess Corporation’s interests in the Beryl
area fields and Scottish Area Gas Evacuation system. This transaction
was completed in January 2013, increasing Shell's production in the
Beryl area fields from 9 thousand boe/d to 20 thousand boe/d.

Also in the UK we acquired Hess Corporation’s 15.7% interest in the
Schiehallion field and its 12.9% interest in the Schiehallion floating
production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility for $0.5 billion. In
February 2013, we also acquired an additional 5.9% interest in the
offshore Schiehallion field from Murphy Schiehallion Ltd. bringing our
interest in the field to 55%.

Low North American gas prices led to an accelerated shift in
exploration and appraisal activities, along with production, from
existing dry gas fields to those rich in liquids.

In the USA Shell acquired acreage in the Delaware Permian Basin,
West Texas, from Chesapeake Energy Corporation for an announced
consideration of $1.9 billion. The acreage of approximately 2,200
square kilometres, with an additional 300 square kilometres linked to
contractual conditions, is expected to be rich in oil and natural gas
liquids and currently produces approximately 26 thousand boe/d with
growth potential.

We also took the following final investment decisions during 2012.

In Nigeria we took the final investment decision on the Forcados Yokri
Integrated Project (Shell interest 30%) and the Southern Swamp
Associated Gas Gathering Project (Shell interest 30%). These projects
are expected to produce at peak production approximately

90 thousand boe/d and 85 thousand boe/d respectively, and reduce
flaring intensity.

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012
Business Review > Upstream

In Italy we took the final investment decision on the onshore Tempa
Rossa field (Shell interest 25%) in the Basilicata region. This project is
expected to produce approximately 45 thousand boe/d at peak
production.

In Malaysia we took the final investment decision for the development
of the Malikai deep-water oil field, part of the Block G PSC (Shell
interest 35%), offshore Sabah. The Shell-operated project is expected
to produce approximately 60 thousand boe/d at peak production.

In Canada we took the final investment decision on the Quest carbon
capture and storage project (Shell interest 60%) near Edmonton,
Alberta. The Quest project is expected to capture and store deep
underground more than 1 mtpa of CO, produced in bitumen processing,
and reduce direct emissions from the Scotford Upgrader by up to 35%.

We continued to divest selected Upstream assets during 2012, including
our 40% participating interest in the BS-4 oil and gas exploration block
in the Santos Basin offshore Brazil; our interest in the Gassled natural
gas transport infrastructure joint venture in Norway; our 30% interest in
oil mining leases 30, 34 and 40 in the Niger Delta, Nigeria; our 50%
interest in the Holstein field in the Gulf of Mexico; and our interest in the
Seal area within the Peace River oil sands of Alberta, Canada. Also in
Canada, we sold a 20% interest in our Groundbirch tightgas project. In
Australia we completed the sale of a 17.5% interest in the Prelude FLING
project to INPEX, and a 10% interest to KOGAS. We also completed the
sale of a further 5% interest to CPC Corporation in the first quarter of
2013.

Available-for-sale production

In 2012, hydrocarbon production from new start-ups and the
continuing ramp-up of new projects more than offset the impact of field
declines, and the impact of divestments and exits. There was also
further upside from new wells and improved reliability compared with
2011, partly offset by changes in contractual entitlements and other
non-operational factors.

Production growth was mainly driven by the continued ramp-up of
new projects, notably our Pearl GTL plant in Qatar, the startup of the
Pluto LNG Project in Australia, and the first full year of production from
Qatargas 4. Further additions also came from new startups such as
Harweel in Oman, and the early first production from Gumusut-Kakap
in Malaysia.

In Qatar we achieved full GTL production at our Pearl GTL plant at the
end of the fourth quarter of 2012, with both trains reaching 90% of
capacity. This completed the ramp-up period for this project. The plant
is designed to run at sustained operating rates of 90% or higher.

In Malaysia the GumusutKakap field, located about 120 kilometres
offshore Sabah, began a phase of early production via the Murphy
Sabah Oil operated Kikeh production facility. A dedicated floating
production system is currently under construction for the Gumusut-
Kakap field (Shell interest 33%), which is Shell's first deep-water
opportunity in the country, and is expected to produce approximately
135 thousand boe/d at peak production.

In the USA first production was achieved at the Caesar/Tonga deep-
water project (Shell interest 22.5%) in the Gulf of Mexico. At peak
production, the project is expected to produce approximately

AO thousand boe/d.

In Oman production began at the Harweel Enhanced Oil Recovery
project, which is expected to produce approximately 30 thousand
boe/d at peak production.

Proved reserves

Shell subsidiaries’ and the Shell share of equity-accounted investments’
estimated net proved oil and gas reserves are summarised in the table
on page 28 and are set out in more detail in “Supplementary
information - oil and gas (unaudited)".

In 2012, Shell added 542 million boe of proved reserves before
taking into account production, of which 408 million boe came from
Shell subsidiaries and 134 million boe from the Shell share of
equity-accounted investments.

The change in the yearly average commodity prices between 2011

and 2012 resulted in a net negative impact on the proved reserves of
431 million boe.

Shell subsidiaries

Before taking into account production, Shell subsidiaries added

408 million boe of proved reserves in 2012. This comprised

655 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids and a reduction of
247 million boe (1,431 thousand million scf] of natural gas. Of the
408 million boe: 268 million boe were from the net effects of revisions
and reclassifications; a net decrease of 69 million boe related to
acquisitions and divestments; 196 million boe came from extensions
and discoveries; and 13 million boe were from improved recovery.

After taking into account production of 855 million boe (of which
30 million boe were consumed in operations), Shell subsidiaries’
proved reserves decreased by 447 million boe in 2012.

Shell subsidiaries’ proved developed reserves increased by 19 million
boe to 6,502 million boe, while proved undeveloped reserves
decreased by 466 million boe to 3,371 million boe.

The total addition of 408 million boe before taking into account
production included a net negative impact from commodity price
changes of 438 million boe of proved reserves.

SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL

As part of the total proved reserves’ addition of 542 million boe, we
added 131 million barrels to our synthetic crude oil proved reserves. In
2012, we had synthetic crude oil production of 48 million barrels of
which 2 million barrels were consumed in operations. At December 31,
2012, we had total synthetic crude oil proved reserves of 1,763 million
barrels, of which 1,271 million barrels were proved developed reserves
and 492 million barrels were proved undeveloped reserves.

BITUMEN

As part of the total proved reserves’ addition of 542 million boe, we
added 1 million barrels of bitumen proved reserves. After taking into
account production of 7 million barrels, bitumen proved reserves were
A9 million barrels at December 31, 2012.

Shell share of equity-accounted investments
Before taking into account production, there was an increase of

134 million boe in the Shell share of equity-accounted investments’
proved reserves in 2012. This comprised 91 million barrels of oil and
natural gas liquids and 43 million boe (248 thousand million scf) of
natural gas. Of the 134 million boe: 129 million boe were from the
net effects of revisions and reclassifications; a net decrease of

5 million boe related to acquisitions and divestments; 7 million boe
came from extensions and discoveries; and 3 million boe were from
improved recovery.

After taking into account production of 379 million boe (of which
10 million boe were consumed in operations), the Shell share of
equity-accounted investments’ proved reserves decreased by
245 million boe in 2012.

The Shell share of equity-accounted investments’ proved developed
reserves decreased by 5 million boe to 3,002 million boe, and proved
undeveloped reserves decreased by 240 million boe to 699 million
boe.

The total addition of 134 million boe before taking into account
production included a net positive impact from commodity price
changes of 7 million boe of proved reserves.

Proved undeveloped reserves

In 2012, Shell subsidiaries’ and the Shell share of equity-accounted
investments’ proved undeveloped reserves (PUD] decreased by

706 million boe to 4,070 million boe. This is the result of additions of
122 million boe of new PUD offset by the maturation of 828 million
boe of PUD to proved developed reserves through project execution.
During 2012, Shell spent $9.3 billion on development activities
related to PUD maturation.

Proved undeveloped reserves held for five years or more (PUD5+) at
December 31, 2012, were 1,012 million boe. These relate to
installation of gas compression and drilling of additional gas wells,
which will be executed when required to support existing gas delivery
commitments (Australia, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the
Philippines and Russia); gas cap blow-down awaiting end-ofoil
production (Nigeria); ongoing onshore oil and gas development
(USA); Gulf of Mexico water-injection project execution in progress
(USA); and major complex projects taking longer than five years to
develop (such as in Kazakhstan). Most of the PUDS5+ are held in
locations where Shell has a proven track record of developing similar
major projects or where project execution is ongoing but is taking
longer than expected.

Delivery commitments

Shell sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations
under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally
commit Shell to sell quantities based on production from specified
properties, although some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery
of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.

In the past three years, Shell met all contractual delivery commitments.

In the period 2013 to 2015, Shell is contractually committed to deliver
to third parties and equity-accounted investments a total of
approximately 4,600 thousand million scf of natural gas from Shell
subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments. The sales contracts
contain a mixture of fixed and variable pricing formulae that are
generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil,
natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery.

The shortfall between Shell’s delivery commitments and its proved
developed reserves is estimated at 24% of Shell’s total gas delivery
commitments. This shortfall is expected to be met through the
development of proved undeveloped reserves as well as new projects
and purchases on the spot market.

Exploration

During 2012, Shell participated in seven notable conventional
exploration discoveries and appraisals in Australia, Brazil, Malaysia,
Nigeria and the USA, and 10 notable successful unconventional
appraisals in Australia, Canada, China, and the USA.


--- Page 18 ---

In 2012, Shell participated in 230 productive exploratory wells with
proved reserves allocated (Shell share: 168 wells). See page 155 for
further information.

In 2012, Shell participated in a further 314 wells (Shell share: 214
wells) that remained pending determination at December 31, 2012.

In 2012, Shell added acreage to its exploration portfolio mainly from
new licences in Albania, Australia, Benin, Canada, China, Malaysia,
New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Tanzania, the UK and the USA.

In total, Shell secured rights to 120,000 square kilometres of new
exploration acreage, including positions in liquids-rich shales. This
was offset by divestments and relinquishments of acreage, which took
place in various countries (mainly Australia, China, Egypt, Germany,
Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Tanzani

Business and property

Shell subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments are involved in all
aspects of Upstream activities, including matters such as land tenure,
entitlement to produced hydrocarbons, production rates, royalties,
pricing, environmental protection, social impact, exports, taxes and
foreign exchange.

The conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which oil and
gas interests are held vary from country to country. In almost all cases
outside North America the legal agreements are generally granted by or
entered into with a government, government entity or government-run oil
and gas company, and the exploration risk usually rests with the
independent oil and gas company. In North America these agreements
may also be with private parties who own mineral rights. Of these
agreements, the following are most relevant to Shell’s interests:

« licences (or concessions), which entitle the holder to explore for
hydrocarbons and exploit any commercial discoveries. Under a
licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and
production activities, and is responsible for financing these activities.
In principle, the licence holder is entitled to the totality of production
less any royalties in kind. The government, government entity or
government-run oil and gas company may sometimes enter as a joint-
venture participant sharing the rights and obligations of the licence
but usually without sharing the exploration risk. In a few cases, the
government entity, government-run oil and gas company or agency
has an option to purchase a certain share of production;

lease agreements, which are typically used in North America and
are usually governed by similar terms as licences. Participants may
include governments or private entities, and royalties are either paid
in cash or in kind; and

production-sharing contracts (PSCs) entered into with a government,
government entity or government-run oil and gas company. PSCs
generally oblige the independent oil and gas company, as
contractor, to provide all the financing and bear the risk of
exploration, development and production activities in exchange for a
share of the production. Usually, this share consists of a fixed or
variable part that is reserved for the recovery of the contractor's cost
(cost oil). The remaining production is split with the government,
government entity or governmentrun oil and gas company on a fixed
or volume/revenue-dependent basis. In some cases, the government,
government entity or governmentrun oil and gas company will
participate in the rights and obligations of the contractor and will
share in the costs of development and production. Such participation
can be across the venture, or on a field-by-field basis. Additionally,
as the price of oil or gas increases above certain predetermined
levels, the independent oil and gas company’s entitlement share of

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012
Business Review > Upstream

production normally decreases. Accordingly, its interest in a project
may not be the same as its entitlement.

EUROPE

Denmark

We hold a non-operating interest in a producing concession covering
the majority of our activities in Denmark. The concession was granted
in 1962 and will expire in 2042. Our interest reduced to 36.8% from
46% in July 2012, when the government entered the partnership with
a 20% interest and the government profit share of 20% was abolished.

Ireland

We are the operator of the Corrib Gas project (Shell interest 45%),
which is currently at an advanced stage of construction. At peak
production, Corrib is expected to supply a significant proportion of the
country’s natural gas needs.

The Netherlands

Shell and ExxonMobil are 50:50 shareholders in Nederlandse
Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM), the largest hydrocarbon producer
in the Netherlands. An important part of NAM’s gas production comes
from the onshore Groningen gas field, in which the Dutch government
has a 40% interest, with NAM holding the remaining 60%. NAM also
has a 60% interest in the Schoonebeek oil field, which has been
redeveloped using enhanced oil recovery technology. NAM also
operates a significant number of other onshore gas fields and offshore
gas fields in the North Sea.

Norway
We are a partner in more than 20 production licences on the
Norwegian continental shelf and are the operator in six of these,
including the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17%) and the
Draugen oil field, where we increased our interest to 44.6%. We have
interests in the Troll, Gjoa, and Kvitebjorn fields, and have further
interests in the Valemon field development and various other potential
development assets.

United Kingdom

We operate a significant number of our interests on the UK
Continental Shelf on behalf of a 50:50 joint venture with ExxonMobil.
Most of our UK oil and gas production comes from the North Sea. We
hold various non-operated interests in the Atlantic Margin area,
principally in the West of Shetlands area. We have increased our
interest in the non-operated Schiehallion field to 55%, and in the Beryl
area fields, with interests ranging from 25% to 66%.

Rest of Europe
Shell also has interests in Albania, Austria, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, Spain and Ukraine.

ASIA (INCLUDING THE MIDDLE EAST AND RUSSIA)

Brunei
Shell and the Brunei government are 50:50 shareholders in Brunei Shell
Petroleum Company Sendirian Berhad (BSP). BSP holds long-term oil and
gas concession rights onshore and offshore Brunei, and sells most of its
natural gas production to Brunei LNG Sendirian Berhad (BLNG, Shell
interest 25%). BLNG was the first LNG plant in Asia-Pacific, and sells
most of its LNG on long-term contracts to customers in Asia.

We are the operator for the Block A concession (Shell interest 53.9%),
which is under exploration and development. We have a 35% interest
in the Block B concession, where gas and condensate are produced

from the Maharaja Lela Field. In addition, we have a 12.5% interest in
exploration Block CA-2 under a PSC.

China

We operate the onshore Changbei tight-gas field under a PSC with
PetroChina. The PSC was amended in July 2012 for developing tight
gas in different geological layers of the same block.

Shell and PetroChina have also agreed to appraise, develop and
produce tight gas in the Jingiu block under a PSC that expires in 2040
(Shell interest 49%) and signed a PSC in March 2012 for shale-gas
exploration, development and production in the Fushun Yongchuan
block (Shell interest 49%), both in Sichuan. Shell and PetroChina are
also assessing opportunities in coalbed methane in the Ordos Basin.

In 2012, Shell became a party to the Zitong PSC for tight gas
exploration, development and production in Sichuan (Shell interest
44.1%).

Shell has agreed with Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation to
appraise and potentially develop two offshore oil and gas blocks in the
Yinggehai Basin under a PSC signed in July 2012 (Shell interest 49%).

Indonesia

We have a 30% participating interest in the offshore Masela block

where INPEX Masela is the operator. The Masela block contains the
Abadi gas field. The operator has currently selected a floating LNG
(FLNG) concept for the field’s first development phase.

Iran
Shell transactions in Iran are disclosed in accordance with Section 13(r)
of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See page 51.

Iraq
We have a 45% interest in the Majnoon oil field that we operate under
a technical service contract that expires in 2030. The other Majnoon
shareholders are PETRONAS (30%) and the Iraqi government (25%),
which is represented by the Missan Oil Company. Majnoon is located
in southern Iraq and is one of the world’s largest oil fields. The first
phase of the development is planned to bring production to
approximately 175 thousand b/d from the level of 45 thousand b/d
when the contract entered into effect in March 2010. We also have a
15% interest in the West Qurna 1 field. At the end of 2012,
production was approximately 460 thousand b/d. According to the
provisions of both contracts, Shell’s equity entitlement volumes will be
lower than the Shell interest implies.

In 2012, Shell continued to work in establishing Basrah Gas
Company, a joint venture between Shell (44%), South Gas Company
(51%) and Mitsubishi Corporation (5%). The Basrah Gas Company
will gather, treat and process raw gas produced from the Rumaila,
West Qurna 1 and Zubair fields. Currently, an estimated 700 million
scf/d of gas is flared because of a lack of infrastructure to collect and
process it. The processed natural gas and associated products, such as
condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), will be sold primarily
to the domestic market with the potential to export any surplus.

Kazakhstan

We have a 16.8% interest in the offshore Kashagan field, where the
North Caspian Operating Company is the operator. This shallow-
water field covers an area of approximately 3,400 square kilometres.
Phase 1 development of the field is expected to lead to plateau
production of approximately 300 thousand boe/d, increasing further
with additional phases of development. NC Production Operations

Company, a joint venture between Shell and KazMunayGas, will
manage production operations. First production is expected in 2013.

We have an interest of 55% in the Pearls PSC, covering an area of
approximately 900 square kilometres located in the Kazakh sector of
the Caspian Sea that includes two oil discoveries (Auezov and
Khazar) and several exploration prospects.

Malaysia
We produce oil and gas located offshore Sabah and Sarawak under
19 PSCs, in which our interests range from 30% to 85%.

In Sabah we operate four producing offshore oil fields with interests
ranging from 50% to 80% as part of the 2011 North Sabah EOR PSC
and SB1 PSC (the latter expired at the end of December 2012). We
also have additional interests ranging from 30% to 50% in PSCs for
the exploration and development of five deep-water blocks. These
include the GumusutKakap deep-water field (Shell interest 33%) and
the Malikai field (Shell interest 35%). Both these fields are currently
being developed with Shell as the operator. We started production
from GumusutKakap in November 2012, ahead of completion of a
floating production system. We did this by connecting two wells to the
Kikeh production facility, which is operated by Murphy Sabah Oil.
We also have a 21% interest in the Siakap North-Petai field and a
30% interest in the Kebabangan field.

In Sarawak we are the operator of 20 gas fields with interests ranging
from 37.5% to 70%. Nearly all of the gas produced is supplied to
Malaysia LNG in Bintulu where we have a 15% interest in each of the
Dua and Tiga LNG plants. We also have a 40% interest in the 2011
Baram Delta EOR PSC and a 50% interest in Block SK-307.

In 2012, we signed five new exploration PSCs: Deepwater Block 2B,
SK318, SK319 and SK408, all offshore Sarawak, and $B311,
offshore Sabah.

We also operate a GTL plant (Shell interest 72%), which is adjacent to
the Malaysia LNG facilities in Bintulu. Using Shell technology, the
plant converts natural gas into high-quality middle distillates, drilling
fluids, waxes and other speciality products.

Oman
We have a 34% interest in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the
operator of an oil concession expiring in 2044. In 2012, production
began at its Harweel Enhanced Oil Recovery project, which is
expected to produce approximately 30 thousand boe/d at peak
production.

We are also participating in the development of the Mukhaizna oil
field (Shell interest 17%) where steam flooding, an enhanced oil
recovery method, is being applied on a large scale.

We have a 30% interest in Oman LNG, which mainly supplies Asian
markets under long-term contracts. We also have an 11% indirect
interest in Qalhat LNG, another Oman-based LNG facility.

Qatar

Pearl in Qatar is the world’s largest GTL plant. Shell operates the plant
under a development and production-sharing contract with the
government of Qatar. The fully integrated facility includes production,
transport and processing of approximately 1.6 billion sct/d of
well-head gas from Qatar’s North Field with installed capacity of
about 140 thousand boe/d of high-quality liquid hydrocarbon
products and 120 thousand boe/d of NGL and ethane. Ramp-up of
the project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. The plant


--- Page 20 ---

delivered its 100th cargo in mid-December and produced GTI Jet fuel,
with its first commercial market introduction in January 2013.

We have a 30% interest in Qatargas 4, which comprises integrated
facilities to produce approximately 1.4 billion scf/d of natural gas
from Qatar's North Field, an onshore gas-processing facility and an
LNG train with a collective production capacity of 7.8 mtpa of LNG
and 70 thousand boe/d of NGL. The train delivered its first LNG in
2011 and has been operating at full capacity in 2012. The LNG is
shipped mainly to markets in North America, China, Europe and the
United Arab Emirates.

We are the operator of Block D under the terms of an exploration and
production-sharing contract with Qatar Petroleum, representing the
national government. We have a 75% interest, with PetroChina
holding the remaining 25% interest.

Russia
We have a 27.5% interest in Sakhalin-2, one of the world’s largest
integrated oil and gas projects. Located in a subarctic environment,
the project produced approximately 335 thousand boe/d in 2012.
Following optimisation of the LNG plant, production from its two trains
exceeded 10 million tonnes in 2012.

We have a 50% interest in the Salym fields in western Siberia, where
production was approximately 155 thousand boe/d during 2012.

We also have a 100% interest in four exploration and production
licences. They are for the East Talotinskiy area in the Nenets
Autonomous District, the Barun-Yustinsky block in Kalmykia and the
Arkatoitsky and the Lenzitsky blocks in the Yamalo Nenets
Autonomous District. We also have an exploration licence in the
North-Vorkutinsky area in the Komi Republic.

United Arab Emirates

In Abu Dhabi we hold a concessionary interest of 9.5% in the oil and
gas operations run by Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil
Operations (ADCO). The licence expires in 2014. We also have a
15% interest in the licence of Abu Dhabi Gas Industries Limited
(GASCO), which expires in 2028. GASCO exports propane, butane
and heavier-liquid hydrocarbons that it extracts from the wet natural
gas associated with the oil produced by ADCO.

Rest of Asia (including the Middle East and Russia)

Shell also has interests in India, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, the
Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and Turkey. We
suspended all exploration and production activities in Syria in
December 2011.

OCEANIA

Australia

We have interests in offshore production and exploration licences in the
North West Shelf (NWS) and Greater Gorgon areas of the Carnarvon
Basin, as well as in the Browse Basin and Timor Sea. Some of these
interests are held directly and others indirectly through a shareholding of
approximately 23% in Woodside Petroleum Ltd (Woodside). All interests
in Australian assets quoted below are direct interests.

Woodside is the operator of the Pluto LNG Project which produced its
first LNG in 2012. Woodside is also the operator on behalf of six joint
venture participants of the NWS gas, condensate and oil fields, which
produced more than 470 thousand boe/d in 2012. Shell provides
technical support for the NWS development.

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 | 25
Business Review > Upstream

We have a 50% interest in Arrow Energy Holdings Pty Limited
(Arrow), a Queensland-based joint venture with PetroChina. Arrow
owns coalbed methane assets, a domestic power business and the site
for a proposed LNG plant on Curtis Island, near Gladstone. In January
2012, Arrow completed the acquisition of coalbed methane company
Bow Energy Ltd (Shell-share consideration $0.3 billion).

We have a 25% interest in the Gorgon LNG project, which involves
the development of some of the largest gas discoveries to date in
Australia, beginning with the offshore Gorgon (Shell interest 25%) and
Jansz-lo (Shell interest approximately 20%) fields. It includes the
construction of a 15.3 mtpa LNG plant on Barrow Island.

We are the operator of a permit in the Browse Basin in which two
separate gas fields were found: Prelude in 2007, and Concerto in
2009. We are developing these fields on the basis of our innovative
FLNG technology. The Prelude FLNG project is expected to produce
about 110 thousand boe/d of natural gas and NGL, delivering
approximately 3.6 mtpa of LNG, 1.3 mtpa of condensate and 0.4 mtpa
of LPG. During 2012, we commenced construction of the Prelude FING
project and completed the sale of a 17.5% interest to INPEX and a 10%.
interest to KOGAS. We also completed the sale of a 5% interest to CPC
Corporation in the first quarter of 2013, reducing our interest to 67.5%.

MGIATY SSINISNE |

We formed a joint venture to operate the Crux gas and condensate
field (Shell interest 82%). We also operate the AC/PA1 block (Shell
interest 75%).

We are also a partner in the Browse joint ventures covering the
Brecknock, Calliance and Torosa gas fields. During 2012, we
increased our interest in the West Browse joint venture to 35% and in
the East Browse joint venture to 25%. The Browse resources are being
assessed for development on the basis of an LNG export project.

In the Timor Sea we have a 26.6% interest in the Sunrise gas field. The
joint-venture partners have selected FLNG as the preferred
development concept for Sunrise. The development is subject to
approval from both the Australian and Timor-Leste governments.

Shell is a partner in both Shell-operated and non-operated exploration
joint ventures in multiple basins including the Bonaparte, Exmouth
Plateau, Greater Gorgon, Outer Canning and South Exmouth.

We also have a 6.4% interest in the Wheatstone LNG project, which
includes the construction of two LNG trains with a combined capacity
of 8.9 mtpa.

Rest of Oceania
Shell also has interests in New Zealand.

AFRICA

Nigeria
Shell-share production in Nigeria was approximately 365 thousand
boe/d in 2012 compared with approximately 385 thousand boe/d in
2011. Security, crude oil theft and flooding in the Niger Delta were
significant challenges in 2012.

Onshore The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd
(SPDC) is the operator of a joint venture (Shell interest 30%) that holds
more than 25 Niger Delta onshore oil mining leases (OMLs), which
expire in 2019. To provide funding, Modified Carry Agreements are
in place for certain key projects and a bridge loan was drawn down
by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) in 2010. The
Modified Carry Agreements are being reimbursed, and in


--- Page 21 ---

Business Review > Upstream

December 2012 NNPC repaid the bridge loan with interest. New
financing agreements with NNPC are under discussion and are
expected to be put in place during 2013.

We have a 30% interest in the Gbaran-Ubie integrated oil and gas
project in Bayelsa State, which delivered 0.9 billion scf/d of gas in
2012. Gas from Gbaran-Ubie is delivered to Nigeria LNG Ltd (NLNG}
for export. In October 2012, SPDC declared force majeure on gas
supplies, as a result of a security incident on the Bomu-Bonny trunkline
and rain flooding. This force majeure was lifted the following month
and the impact on SPDC gas production was very limited.

In 2012, we sold our 30% interests in OMLs 30, 34 and 40 for a
consideration of $1.1 billion.

Offshore Our main offshore deep-water activities are carried out by Shell
Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (Shell interest 100%)
which holds interests in three deep-water blocks. We operate two of the
blocks, including the Bonga field 120 kilometres offshore. Deep-water
offshore activities are typically governed through PSCs.

SPDC also holds an interest in six shallow-water offshore leases, of
which five expired on November 30, 2008. However, SPDC satisfied
all the requirements of the Nigerian Petroleum Act to be entitled to an
extension. Currently, the status quo is maintained following a court
order issued on November 26, 2008. SPDC is pursuing a negotiated
solution with the federal government of Nigeria. Production from the
EA field, in one of the disputed leases, continued throughout 2012.

LNG Shell has a 25.6% interest in NING, which operates six LNG
trains with a total capacity of 22.0 mtpa. NLNG continued production
near full capacity during 2012.

Rest of Africa
Shell also has interests in Benin, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, Libya, South
Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia.

NORTH AMERICA

Canada

We hold more than 2,200 mineral leases in Canada, mainly in
Alberta and British Columbia. We produce and market natural gas,
NGL, synthetic crude oil and bitumen. In addition, we hold significant
exploration acreage offshore. Bitumen is a very heavy crude oil
produced through conventional methods as well as through enhanced
oil-recovery methods. Synthetic crude oil is produced by mining
bitumen-saturated sands, extracting the bitumen from the sands, and
transporting it fo a processing facility where hydrogen is added to
produce a wide range of feedstocks for refineries.

Gas and liquids-rich shale We hold rights to more than 10,000
square kilometres of conventional gas, tight gas and liquids-rich shale
acreage. We own and operate four natural gas processing and
sulphur-extraction plants in southern and south-central Alberta. We
continued to develop conventional gas, tight gas and liquids-rich shale
fields in west-central Alberta and east-central British Columbia during
2012, through drilling programmes and investment in infrastructure
facilitating new production.

Synthetic crude oil We operate the Athabasca Oil Sands Project
(AOSP) in north-east Alberta as part of a joint venture (Shell interest
60%). The AOSP’s bitumen production capacity is 255 thousand
boe/d. The bitumen is transported by pipeline for processing at the
Scotford Upgrader, which is operated by Shell and located in the
Edmonton area, Alberta. The first phase of the AOSP debottlenecking

project comes online in 2013, and is expected to add an additional
10 thousand boe/d at peak production. We also took the final
investment decision on the Quest carbon capture and storage project
(Shell interest 60%), which is expected to capture and permanently
store more than | mtpa of CO, from the Scotford Upgrader.

Shell also holds a number of other minable oil sands leases in the
Athabasca region with expiry dates ranging from 2018 to 2025. By
completing a certain minimum level of development prior to their
expiry, leases may be extended.

Bitumen We produce and market bitumen in the Peace River area of
Alberta, and have a steam-assisted gravity drainage project in
operation near Cold Lake, Alberta. Additional heavy oil resources and
advanced recovery technologies are under evaluation on
approximately 1,200 square kilometres in the Grosmont oil sands
area, also in northern Alberta.

Offshore We have a 31.3% interest in the Sable Offshore Energy
project, a natural-gas complex offshore eastern Canada. We also have
a 100% operating interest in frontier deep-water acreage offshore Nova
Scotia, a 20% non-operating interest in an exploration asset off the east
coast of Newfoundland, and a number of exploration licences in the
Mackenzie Delta in the Northwest Territories.

United States of America

We produce oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico, heavy oil in California
and primarily tight gas and associated liquid hydrocarbons in
Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming. The majority of our oil
and gas production interests are acquired under leases granted by the
owner of the minerals underlying the relevant acreage (including many
leases for federal onshore and offshore tracts). Such leases usually run
on an initial fixed term that is automatically extended by the
establishment of production for as long as production continues,
subject to compliance with the terms of the lease (including, in the case
of federal leases, extensive regulations imposed by federal law).

Gulf of Mexico The Gulf of Mexico is the major production area in the
USA, accounting for almost 50% of Shell’s oil and gas production in
the country. We have approximately 420 federal offshore leases in
the Gulf of Mexico, about one-fifth of which are producing. Our share
of production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged almost 190 thousand
boe/d in 2012. Key producing assets are Auger, Brutus, Enchilada,
Mars, NaKika, Perdido, Ram-Powell and Ursa.

Deferments resulting from the 2010 drilling moratorium, delivery of
new-build drilling rigs and new regulatory requirements continued to
affect the operational flexibility and delivery timing of our Gulf of
Mexico activities in 2012. While the new regulatory regime has
resulted in a longer and more complex permitting process, Shell
continues to meet all deep-water regulatory permitting and
environmental assessment requirements. Despite these challenges, we
continued to grow our presence in the Gulf of Mexico, with the
addition of two drilling rigs to our contracted offshore fleet in 2012.
We also secured 24 blocks in the 2012 central lease sale for a sum of
$400 million.

Onshore We hold more than 15,000 square kilometres of tight gas
and liquids-rich shale acreage. This includes significant holdings in the
Marcellus shale, centred on Pennsylvania in north-east USA, the Eagle
Ford shale formation in south Texas, the Sand Wash and Niobrara
Shale in north-west Colorado, as well as the Mississippi Line in
south-central Kansas. In 2012, we also acquired approximately
2,200 square kilometres of mineral rights, with an additional


--- Page 22 ---

300 square kilometres linked to contractual conditions, in the
Delaware Permian Basin in west Texas.

California We have a 51.8% interest in Aera Energy LLC (Aera),
which holds assets in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles Basin
areas of southern California. Aera operates more than 15,000 wells,
producing approximately 130 thousand boe/d of heavy oil and gas.

Alaska We hold more than 410 federal leases for exploration in the
Beaufort and Chukchi seas in Alaska. During the 2012 drilling season,
we drilled two exploratory wells, one each in the Beaufort and
Chukchi seas. These wells are known as top holes as they do not go
deep enough to reach hydrocarbon reservoirs. After drilling they were
safely capped in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Rest of North America
Shell also has interests in Greenland and Mexico.

SOUTH AMERICA

Brazil

We are the operator of several producing fields offshore Brazil. They
include the Bijupiré and Salema fields (Shell interest 80%) and the
BC-10 field (Shell interest 50%). We also operate one offshore
exploration block in the Santos Basin, BMS-54 (Shell interest 80%).
We have interests in two offshore exploration blocks in the Espirito
Santo basins, BMES-23 and BMES-27, with a 20% and 17.5% interest
respectively. Shell also operates five blocks in the SGo Francisco
onshore basin area. In 2012, we divested our 40% interest in the
offshore Block BS-4 in the Santos Basin.

We also have an 18% interest in Brazil Companhia de Gas de Sao
Paulo (Comgas), a natural gas distribution company in the state of Sao
Paulo.

French Guiana
We are the operator of an exploration block in the 24,000 square
kilometres deep-water Guyane Maritime Permit (Shell interest 45%).

Rest of South America
Shell also has interests in Argentina, Colombia, Guyana and
Venezuela.

TRADING
We market a portion of our share of equity production of LNG and
also trade LNG volumes around the world through our hubs in Dubai,
the Netherlands and Singapore. We also market and trade natural
gas, power and emission rights in the Americas and Europe.

[A] Segment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis. See

information:

Overview

Shell’s Downstream organisation is made up of a number of different
business activities, part of an integrated value chain, that collectively
turn crude oil into a range of refined products, which are moved and
marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use.
The products include gasoline, diesel, heating oil, aviation fuel,
marine fuel, lubricants, bitumen, sulphur and liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG). In addition, we produce and sell petrochemicals for industrial
use worldwide.

Our Refining activities comprise Manufacturing, Supply and
Distribution. Marketing includes Retail, Lubricants, Business to Business
(B2B) and Alternative Energies. Chemicals has dedicated
manufacturing and marketing units of its own. We also trade crude oil,
oil products and petrochemicals, primarily to optimise feedstock for
Manufacturing and Chemicals and to supply our Marketing
businesses.

Downstream earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis
(CCS earnings}. On this basis, the purchase price of the volumes sold
during a period is based on the current cost of supplies during the
same period, after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings
therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory
valuation. Accordingly, when oil prices increase during the period,
CCS earnings are likely to be lower than earnings calculated on a
first-in first-out basis (FIFO). Similarly, in a period with declining oil
prices, CCS earnings are likely to be higher than earnings calculated
on a FIFO basis. This explains why 2012 CCS earnings were

$463 million higher than earnings calculated on a FIFO basis (2011:
$2,355 million lower; 2010: $1,498 million lower).

Business cond ions

The industrial landscape in 2012 reflected weaker economic growth
in several regions, which reduced demand. Even so, refining margins
were higher in 2012 compared with 2011 in key refining hubs,
except Asia. Chemical margins in Europe and Asia were lower than in
2011 as a result of weak macroeconomic conditions, although US
ethane cracker margins rose significantly due to the wide price
differential between crude oil and natural gas, and improved
marketing margins.

Business Review > Downstream

Earnings 2012-2011

Segment earnings in 2012 were $5,350 million, 25% higher than in
2011. This increase reflected a return to profitability in Refining,
although marginal, as a result of higher realised refining margins and
better refinery availability that were partly offset by lower Chemicals
earnings. Trading contributions were lower in 2012 than in 2011,
while Marketing contributions were broadly unchanged. Both activities
continued to contribute significantly to Downstream earnings.

Realised refining margins recovered strongly from their low level at the
end of 2011, and improved across all regions apart from Asia.
Refinery intake volumes were 1% lower compared with 2011.
However, when portfolio impacts are excluded, refinery intake
volumes were 4% higher than in 2011. Refinery availability increased
to 93% compared with 92% in 2011.

Chemicals earnings were lower, mainly as a result of the global
economic slowdown, supply constraints of favourable feedstocks in the
USA, and the impact of hurricane Isaac on operations. Chemicals
sales volumes were 1% lower compared with 2011, as reductions in
European manufacturing capacity and rationalisation of the contract
portfolio were largely offset by improved operating performance.
Chemical plant availability increased to 91% compared with 89% in
2011.

Oil products sales volumes were 1% higher compared with 2011.
Lower marketing volumes, mainly as a result of portfolio divestments,
were more than offset by higher trading volumes. Excluding the impact
of divestments and the effect of the formation of the Raizen biofuel
joint venture, oil products sales volumes were 3% higher compared
with 2011.

Overall, operating expenses decreased in 2012 compared with

2011. Production and manufacturing expenses declined, driven by
manufacturing divestments, cost reduction initiatives and favourable
currency exchange rate effects. Selling, distribution and administrative
expenses were broadly unchanged; cost reductions, portfolio
divestments and favourable currency exchange rate effects were offset
by spending related to higher volumes, and growth-stimulating
programmes.

Earnings in 2012 included a net gain of $39 million. There were net
gains on divestments and a tax credit, partly offset by legal and
environmental provisions. The divestments relate to a number of retail
sites in Canada, LPG businesses in Malaysia and the Philippines, as
well as the continuation of the divestment of our Downstream activities
in Africa.

Earnings in 2011 included a net gain of $15 million. There was a
gain from the fair-value accounting of commodity derivatives, a gain
arising from the formation of the Raizen joint venture, a net gain on
divestments and a tax credit. These gains were significantly offset by
charges related to impairments, redundancy, decommissioning and
legal provisions. The 2011 divestments included the sale of our
Stanlow refinery in the UK, the majority of our Downstream activities in
seven African countries, our Downstream activities in Chile and
additional non-core business exits.

Earnings 2011-2010

Segment earnings in 2011, which included a net gain of $15 million
as described above, were $4,289 million, 45% higher than in 2010.
Earnings in 2010 included a net charge of $923 million. Impairment
charges were partly offset by a gain related to the fair-value
accounting of commodity derivatives, gains from divestments and a

gain from the sale of land holdings associated with the former Shell
Haven refinery in the UK.

All gains and charges identified above relate to items that individually
exceed $50 million. The following comments relate to earnings after
excluding the net gain of $15 million from the 2011 results and the net
charge of $923 million from the 2010 results.

Downstream earnings increased in 2011 compared with 2010,
supported by improved realised unit marketing margins in most
businesses, although oil products sales volumes declined, mainly as a
result of portfolio divestments and the effects of the formation of the
Raizen joint venture. Chemicals reported record earnings in 2011 as
the market environment was favourable during most of the year,
resulting in higher realised margins, partly offset by the impact of
unplanned operational events on Chemicals sales volumes. Realised
refining margins were in line with 2010 until the fourth quarter, when
margins declined significantly as global market conditions
deteriorated. As a result, Refining reported a larger loss in 2011 than
in 2010. This loss was largely offset by increased contributions from
trading activities due to higher market volatility and greater arbitrage
opportunities relative to 2010.

Net capital investment
Net capital investment was $4.3 billion in both 2012 and 2011.

Capital investment was $5.5 billion in 2012, of which $3.2 billion
was in Refining and Chemicals, and $2.3 billion was in Marketing.
Approximately 56% of our 2012 capital investment was used to
maintain the integrity and performance of our asset base.

In 2011, capital investment was $7.5 billion, of which $3.3 billion
was in Refining and Chemicals, and $4.2 billion was in Marketing. Of
the $4.2 billion in Marketing, we invested $1.7 billion in Raizen and
$0.4 billion in the acquisition of 253 retail stations in the UK.

Divestment proceeds were $1.2 billion in 2012 compared with
$3.2 billion in 2011. The planned asset divestment programme to
refocus our Downstream portfolio is now mostly complete.

Portfolio actions

In Refining, Shell acquired the remaining outstanding shares in Gasnor
AS, a market leader in Norway, that supplies LNG as a transport fuel
to industrial and marine customers.

In Australia refining operations at the 79 thousand b/d Clyde refinery
ceased. The Clyde refinery and the Gore Bay terminal are in the
process of being converted into a fuel import facility.

In Marketing, Shell agreed to acquire Neste Oil Corporation's network
of 105 retail sites in Poland.

Shell completed the sale of the majority of its shareholding in
downstream activities in Botswana, Burkina Faso, Céte d'Ivoire,
Guinea, Kenya and Namibia, whilst downstream activities in
Tanzania were discontinued. The agreements form part of the
divestment of Shell’s shareholding in most of its downstream activities
in Africa as announced in 2011. Shell continues to divest non-strategic
Downstream positions. Divestments included retail stations in

North America and most of our LPG activities in Asia-Pacific.

Business and property
REFINING

Manufacturing

We have interests in more than 30 refineries worldwide with the
capacity to process approximately 3.4 million barrels of crude oil per
day. Approximately 40% of our refining capacity is in Europe and
Africa, 35% in the Americas and 25% in Asia-Pacific. The Port Arthur
refinery expansion project in Texas, USA, owned by Motiva
Enterprises (Shell interest 50%), restarted operations in early 2013,
following operational issues in 2012. The expansion brings an
additional 320 thousand b/d of capacity online in the US Gulf Coast
region (increasing the refinery’s total capacity to 620 thousand b/d).

Supply and Distribution

With more than 1,500 storage tanks and approximately 150
distribution facilities in approximately 25 countries, our Supply and
Distribution infrastructure is well positioned for making deliveries
throughout the world. Deliveries include feedstock for our refineries as
well as finished products for our Marketing businesses and customers
worldwide.

MARKETING

Retail

We have about 44,000 service stations in more than 70 countries and
more than 100 years’ experience in fuel development. In recent years,
we have concentrated on developing differentiated fuels with special
formulations designed to clean engines and improve performance. We
sell such fuels under the Shell V-Power brand in more than 60
countries.

Lubricants

Across approximately 100 countries we make, market and sell
technically advanced lubricants not only for passenger cars, trucks
and coaches but also for industrial machinery in manufacturing,
mining, power generation, agriculture and construction.

Our strong competitive positioning was highlighted by a number of
leading market research firms. The tenth annual Kline & Company
report on the global lubricants sector (Global Lubricants Industry
2011: Market Analysis and Assessment) confirmed that Shell
maintained its volume and branded leadership position during 2011
with a 13% market share.

Business to Business
Our Business to Business (B2B) activities sell fuels, speciality products
and services to a broad range of commercial customers.

Shell Aviation provides fuel for approximately 7,000 aircraft every
day at more than 800 airports in more than 35 countries. On average
we refuel a plane every 12 seconds.

Shell Gas (LPG) provides liquefied petroleum gas and related services
to retail, commercial and industrial customers for cooking, heating,
lighting and transport.

Shell Commercial Fuels provides transport, industrial and heating fuels
in 20 countries. Our wide range of products, from reliable main-grade
fuels with standard quality to premium products, can offer tangible
benefits. These include fuel economy, enhanced equipment
performance, such as longer life and lower maintenance costs, and
environmental benefits, such as reduced emissions.

Shell Bitumen supplies on average 11,000 tonnes of products every
day to 1,600 customers worldwide and invests in technology research
and development to create innovative, award-winning new products.

Shell Sulphur Solutions has developed a dedicated sulphur business to
manage the complete value chain of sulphur, from refining to
marketing. The business provides sulphur for industries such as mining
and textiles and also develops new products which incorporate
sulphur, for example in road surfaces, fertilisers and concrete.

Our marine activities provide lubricants, fuels and related technical
services to the shipping and boating industries. We supply more than
100 grades of lubricants and 20 different types of fuel for marine
vessels powered by diesel, steam-turbine and gas-turbine engines. We
serve more than 15,000 vessels worldwide, ranging from large ocean-
going tankers to small fishing boats.

Alternative Energies

We investigate alternative energy technologies with a long-term
aspiration to develop them into business opportunities. We were one
of the first companies to invest in advanced biofuels. Our Raizen joint
venture in Brazil produces sustainable ethanol from sugar, and
manages a retail network. With an annual production capacity of
more than 2 billion litres, itis one of the largest biofuel producers in
the world. We also continue to research and explore the potential of
hydrogen as an alternative energy source for the longer term.

Shell CO, is responsible for coordinating and driving CO»
management activities across all our businesses.

CHEMICALS

Manufacturing

Our plants produce a range of base chemicals, including ethylene,
propylene and aromatics, as well as intermediate chemicals, such as
styrene monomer, propylene oxide, solvents, detergent alcohols,
ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol. We have the capacity to produce
nearly 6 mtpa of ethylene.

Marketing

We sell petrochemicals to about 1,000 major industrial customers
worldwide, with the top 20 customers accounting for more than 40%
of our revenue. Our Chemicals business is in the top 10 of chemicals
enterprises in the world by revenue. Its products are used to make
numerous everyday items, from clothing and cars, to bubble bath and
bicycle helmets.

TRADING
Our trading activities include the optimisation of our oil value chain,
including where necessary the sale or purchase of the excess or
shortfall of oil products, as well as trading around the physical flow of
hydrocarbons.

We trade in physical and financial contracts, lease storage and
transportation capacities around the globe and manage shipping
activities.

Overview

The Corporate segment covers the non-operating activities supporting
Shell. It includes Shell's holdings and treasury organisation, its
headquarters and central functions as well as its self-insurance
activities. All finance expense and income as well as related taxes are
included in the Corporate segment earnings rather than in the earnings
of the business segments.

The holdings and treasury organisation manages many of the
Corporate entities and is the point of contact between Shell and the
external capital markets. It conducts a broad range of transactions —
from raising debt instruments to transacting foreign exchange.
Treasury centres in London, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro support
these activities.

Headquarters and central functions provide business support in the
areas of communications, finance, health, human resources,
information technology, legal services, real estate and security. They
also provide support for the shareholder-related activities of the
Company. The central functions are supported by business service
centres located around the world which process transactions, manage
data and produce statutory returns, among other services. The majority
of the headquarters and central-function costs are recovered from the
business segments. Those costs that are not recovered are retained in
Corporate.

Shell mainly self-insures its risk exposures. Shell insurance subsidiaries
provide insurance coverage to Shell entities, generally up to

$1.15 billion per event and usually limited to Shell’s percentage
interest in the relevant entity. The type and extent of the coverage
provided is equal to that which is otherwise commercially available in
the third-party insurance market.

Earnings 2012-2010

Segment earnings for 2012 were a loss of $209 million, compared

with a gain of $86 million in 2011 and a gain of $91 million in 2010.

Net interest and investment expense increased by $377 million
between 2011 and 2012. Interest expense was significantly higher,
mostly driven by the liquidity premium associated with our currency
swaps, and an increase in Shell’s share of interest expense from
equity-accounted investments. Further, the amount of interest
capitalised on projects declined overall as major projects came on-
stream, partly offset by the development of new projects. These effects
were partly offset by higher interest income. In 2011, net interest and
investment expense increased by $315 million compared with 2010.
There was a substantial reduction in the amount of interest capitalised
with projects coming on-stream, and Shell's share of interest expense
from equity-accounted investments was higher due to the debt
portfolios of new investments. These effects were partly offset by an
increase in interest income as a result of higher average levels of cash
balances.

Foreign exchange gains of $169 million in 2012 were principally due
to the favourable impact of exchange rates on non-functional currency
loans and cash balances in operating units. In 2011, foreign
exchange losses of $77 million were principally due to the adverse
impact of exchange rates on these items.

Other earnings decreased by $164 million in 2012 compared with
2011, mainly because of increased costs partly offset by higher tax
credits. The increase from 2010 to 2011 of $429 million was mainly
due to increased tax credits and reduced costs.

Business Review > Liquidity and capital resources

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

We manage our assets and liabilities with the aim that, across the
business cycle, “cash in” (including cash from operations and
divestments) at least equals “cash out” (including capital investment,
interest and dividends), while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

A key measure of our capital structure management is the proportion
of debt to equity. Across the business cycle we aim to manage gearing
(net debt to net debt plus total equity) within the range of 0-30%.
During 2012, gearing ranged from 8.1% to 13.1% (2011: 10.8% to
17.1%). See Note 15 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements”.

With respect to the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet,
our priorities for applying our cash are investing for organic and
inorganic growth, servicing debt commitments, paying dividends and
returning surplus cash to our shareholders.

Overview

The most significant factors affecting our operating cash flow are
earnings and movements in working capital. The main drivers
impacting our earnings include: realised prices for crude oil and
natural gas; production levels of crude oil and natural gas; and
refining and marketing margins.

Since the contribution of Upstream to earnings is larger than that of
Downstream, changes affecting Upstream — particularly changes in
realised crude oil and natural gas prices and production levels — have
the largest impact on Shell's operating cash flow. While Upstream
benefits from higher realised crude oil and natural gas prices, the extent
of such benefit (and the extent of an impact from a decline in these
prices) depends on: the extent to which contractual arrangements are
tied to market prices; the dynamics of production-sharing contracts; the
existence of agreements with governments or national oil companies that
have limited sensitivity to crude oil prices; tax impacts; and the extent to
which changes in commodity prices flow through into operating costs.
Changes in benchmark prices of crude oil and natural gas in any
particular period therefore provide only a broad indicator of changes in
Upstream earnings experienced in that period.

In Downstream, changes in any one of a range of factors derived from
either within the industry or the broader economic environment can
influence margins. The precise impact of any such changes depends
on how the oil markets respond to them. The market response is
affected by factors such as: whether the change affects all crude oil
types or only a specific grade; regional and global crude-oil and
refined-products inventories; and the collective speed of response of
the industry refiners and product marketers in adjusting their
operations. As a result, refinery and marketing margins fluctuate from
region to region and from period to period. Downstream earnings are
reported on a current cost of supplies basis, which excludes the effect
of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. However,
cash flow from operations is not affected by the reporting basis.

In the longer term, replacement of proved oil and gas reserves will
affect our ability to maintain or increase production levels in
Upstream, which in turn will affect our cash flow and earnings. We
will need to take measures to maintain or increase production levels in
future periods. These may include: developing new fields and mines;
developing and applying new technologies and recovery processes to
existing fields and mines; and making selective acquisitions. Our goal

is to increase proved reserves and more than offset their decline due to
production. However, proved reserves and production increases are
subject to a variety of risks and other factors, including: crude oil and
natural gas prices; the uncertainties of exploration; operational
interruptions; geology; frontier conditions; availability of new
technology and engineering capacity; availability and cost of skilled
or specialist resources; project delays; cost overruns; and fiscal,
regulatory and political changes.

We have a diverse portfolio of field-development projects and
exploration opportunities. This diversity can help to reduce the impact
of the political and technical risks in Upstream, including the impact on
the cash flow generated by our operating activities.

It is our intention to continue to make selective acquisitions and
divestments as part of active portfolio management that is in line with
our strategy and influenced by market opportunities.

Statement of cash flows

Net cash from operating activities in 2012 was $46.1 billion, an
increase from $36.8 billion in 2011. This increase mainly reflected a
working capital decrease in 2012, compared with a working capital
increase in 2011. In 2010, net cash from operating activities was
$27.4 billion. The increase in 2011 compared with 2010 mainly
reflected the increase in earnings.

Net cash used in investing activities was $28.4 billion in 2012, an
increase from $20.4 billion in 2011. The increase was mainly the
result of higher capital expenditure and investments in equity-
accounted investments. In 2010, net cash used in investing activities
was $22.0 billion. The decrease in 2011 compared with 2010 was
mainly the result of higher proceeds from the sale of assets and lower
capital expenditure, partly offset by lower proceeds from the sale of
equity-accounted investments.

Net cash used in financing activities in 2012 was $10.6 billion
(2011: $18.1 billion; 2010: $1.5 billion). This included payment of
dividends of $7.4 billion (2011: $6.9 billion; 2010: $9.6 billion),
interest paid of $1.4 billion (2011: $1.7 billion; 2010: $1.3 billion)
and repurchases of shares of $1.5 billion (2011: $1.1 billion; 2010:
$nil). Debt issued in 2012 was largely offset by debt repaid (2011:
net repayments of debt of $7.1 billion; 2010: net new borrowings of
$9.3 billion).

Cash and cash equivalents were $18.6 billion at December 31, 2012
(2011: $11.3 billion; 2010: $13.4 billion).

Financial condition and liquidity

Our financial position is strong. In 2012, we generated a return on
average capital employed (ROACE) of 12.7% (see page 45) and year-
end gearing was 9.2% (2011: 13.1%). We returned $11.0 billion to our
shareholders through dividends in 2012. Some of those dividends were
paid out as 103.8 million shares issued to shareholders who had elected
to receive new shares instead of cash. To partly offset the dilution created
by the issuance of those shares, 43.7 million shares were repurchased
and cancelled as part of our share buyback programme.

The size and scope of our businesses require a robust financial control
framework and effective management of our various risk exposures.
Financial turbulence in the eurozone and other international events
continue to put significant stress on the business environment in which
we operate. We are following closely the developments and the
challenges that the eurozone and other markets face, and are taking
all reasonable steps to ensure that we are well positioned to deal with
unexpected events should they occur.

Our treasury and trading operations are highly centralised, and are
effective in controlling credit exposures associated with managing our
substantial cash, foreign exchange and commodity positions.

We diversify our cash investments across a range of financial
instruments and counterparties to avoid concentrating risk in any one
type of investment or country. We carefully monitor our investments
and adjust them in light of new market information.

Exposure to failed financial and trading counterparties was minimal in
2012 (see Note 21 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements”).

Total employer contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in
2012 were $2.3 billion (2011: $2.3 billion) and are estimated to be
$2.5 billion in 2013, reflecting current funding levels. See Notes 3
and 18 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further
information.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $18.6 billion at the end of
2012 (2011: $11.3 billion). Cash and cash equivalents are held in

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 | 43

various currencies but primarily in dollars, euros and sterling. Total
debt increased by $0.6 billion in 2012 to $37.8 billion at
December 31, 2012. The total debt outstanding (excluding leases) at
December 31, 2012, will mature as follows: 23% in 2013; 8% in
2014; 12% in 2015; 6% in 2016; and 51% in 2017 and beyond.
The debt maturing in 2013 is expected to be repaid from a
combination of cash balances and cash generated from operations.

We also maintain a $5.1 billion credit facility that was undrawn as at
December 31, 2012.

We believe our current working capital is sufficient for present
requirements. We satisfy our funding and working capital
requirements from the cash generated by our businesses and through
the issuance of external debt. Our external debt is principally financed
from the international debt capital markets through central debt
programmes consisting of:

+ a $10 billion global commercial paper (CP) programme, exempt
from registration under section 3 (a)(3) of the US Securities Act of
1933, with maturities not exceeding 270 days;

+ a $10 billion CP programme, exempt from registration under
section 4(2) of the US Securities Act of 1933, with maturities not
exceeding 397 days;

* a $25 billion euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme; and

= an unlimited US universal shelf (US shelf) registration.

MAIATY SSANISNE |

All CP, EMTN and US shelf issuances have been undertaken by Shell
International Finance B.V., the issuance company for Shell, and are
guaranteed by Royal Dutch Shell ple. Further disclosure on debt is
included in Note 15 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements”.
Certain joint-venture operations are financed separately.

In 2012, despite our strong cash position, we took advantage of
favourable market conditions, including historically low interest rates,
to pre-finance bond maturities in 2013 and issued $4.25 billion of
long-term bonds under the US shelf registration. Periodically, for
working capital purposes, we issued commercial paper (2011: we
issued commercial paper, but no long-term bonds).

Our $5.1 billion committed credit facility, which is due to expire in
2015, and internally available liquidity provide back-up coverage for
commercial paper. Aside from certain borrowings in local
subsidiaries, we do not have any other committed credit facilities. We
consider additional facilities to be neither necessary nor cost-effective
for financing purposes, given our size, credit rating and cash-
generative nature.

The maturity profile of our outstanding commercial paper is actively
managed to ensure that the amount of commercial paper maturing
within 30 days remains consistent with the level of supporting liquidity.

While our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions, such as foreign
withholding taxes on the transfer of funds in the form of cash
dividends, loans or advances, such restrictions are not expected to
have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations.

The consolidated unaudited ratio of earnings to fixed charges of Shell
for each of five years ending December 31, 2008-2012, is as follows:

For the purposes of the above table, earnings consist of pre-tax income
from continuing operations (before adjustment for non-controlling interest)
plus fixed charges (excluding capitalised interest) less undistributed
income of equity-accounted investments. Fixed charges consist of
expensed and capitalised interest (excluding accretion expense) plus
interest within rental expenses (for operating leases). Refer to

Dividends

Our policy is to grow the US dollar dividend through time in line with our
view of Shell’s underlying earnings and cash flow. When setting the
dividend, the Board of Directors looks at a range of factors, including
the macro environment, the current balance sheet and future investment
plans. We have announced an interim dividend in respect of the fourth
quarter 2012 of $0.43 per share, a 2.4% increase compared with the
US dollar dividend for the same quarter of 2011. Shareholders have a
choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via our Scrip Dividend
Programme. The Board expects that the first quarter 2013 interim
dividend will be $0.45 per share, an increase of 4.7% compared with
the US dollar dividend for the same quarter of 2012.

Net capital investment

Our net capital investment was $29.8 billion in 2012 (2011:

$23.5 billion; 2010: $23.7 billion). Of the total net capital
investment, $25.3 billion (2011: $19.1 billion; 2010: $21.2 billion)
related to Upstream; $4.3 billion (2011: $4.3 billion; 2010:

$2.4 billion) to Downstream; and $0.2 billion (2011: $0.1 billion;
2010: $0.1 billion) to Corporate.

Our 2012 net capital investment comprised $36.8 billion of capital
investment (2011: $31.1 billion; 2010: $30.6 billion) less $7.0 billion of
divestment proceeds (2011: $7.5 billion; 2010: $6.9 billion)

See Note 4 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further
information.

Financial framework

We manage our businesses to deliver strong cash flows to fund
investment and growth. Our management decisions are based on
assumptions about future oil and gas prices.

Repurchases of shares

On May 22, 2012, the shareholders approved an authority, which will
expire at the end of the 2013 AGM, for the Company to repurchase up
to 632 million of its shares. In accordance with a similar authority
granted at the 2011 AGM, a share buyback programme was
commenced in that year to offset the dilution created by the issuance of
shares under our Scrip Dividend Programme. All of the shares purchased
under the buyback programme were cancelled. A resolution will be
proposed at the 2013 AGM to renew authority for the Company to
purchase its own share capital up to specified limits for another year.
Shares are also purchased by the employee share ownership trusts (see
page 58), in part through re-investment of dividends received, to meet
delivery commitments under employee share plans. All share purchases
are made in open-market transactions.

The following table provides information on repurchases of shares in
2012 and up to February 19, 2013. Purchases in euros and sterling are
converted to dollars using the exchange rate at each transaction date.

Return on average capital employed

ROACE measures the efficiency of Shell’s utilisation of the capital that
it employs. In this calculation, ROACE is defined as income for the
period adjusted for after-tax interest expense as a percentage of the
average capital employed for the period. Capital employed consists of
total equity, current debt and non-current debt. The tax rate is derived
from calculations at the published segment level.

Note 18 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) and obligations
associated with decommissioning and restoration (see Note 19 to the
“Consolidated Financial Statements”)

estimated to be $1.1 billion payable in less than one year,

$1.7 billion payable between one and three years, $1.5 billion
payable between three and five years and $5.9 billion payable five
years and later. For this purpose, we assume that interest rates with
respect to variable interest rate debt remain constant and that there is
no change in the aggregate principal amount of debt other than
repayment at scheduled maturity as reflected in the table.

Guarantees and other off-balance sheet
arrangements

Guarantees at December 31, 2012, were $3.3 billion (2011:

$3.3 billion). This includes $2.2 billion (2011: $2.2 billion) of
guarantees of debt of equity-accounted investments, for which the largest
amount outstanding during 2012 was $2.2 billion (2011: $2.4 billion).

In 2012, about 27% of our average capital employed was not
generating any revenue, which reduced our ROACE by approximately
5%. These assets included projects being developed and exploration
acreage.

Financial information relating to the Royal
Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust

The results of operations and financial position of the Royal Dutch Shell
Dividend Access Trust (the Trust) are included in the consolidated
results of operations and financial position of Shell. Certain condensed
financial information in respect of the Trust is given below. Separate
financial statements for the Trust are also included in this Report.

For the years 2012, 2011 and 2010 the Trust recorded income before
tax of £2,383 million, £2,175 million and £2,863 million
respectively. In each period this reflected the amount of dividends
received on the dividend access share.

At December 31, 2012, the Trust had total equity of £nil (2011: £nil;
2010: £nil), reflecting cash of £1,202,271 (2011: £997,987; 2010:
£774,546) and unclaimed dividends of £1,202,271 (2011:
£997,987; 2010: £774,546). The Trust only records a liability for an
unclaimed dividend, and a corresponding amount of cash, to the
extent that cheques expire, which is one year after their issuance, or to
the extent that they are returned unpresented.

OUR PEOPLE

Competitiveness and innovation

Our people are central to our aim of being the world’s most
competitive and innovative energy company. We recruit, train and
recompense them according to a people strategy based on three
priorities: assuring sources of talent now and in the future;
strengthening leadership and professionalism; and enhancing
individual and organisational performance.

Over the course of 2012, Shell employed an average of 87,000
people in more than 70 countries. We had a strong external
recruitment drive to execute our strategy and growth plans for the
future, hiring approximately 1,200 graduates and 3,500 experienced
professionals. The majority of our graduates and experienced
professional hires came from technical disciplines.

Employee communication and involvement
Two-way dialogue between management and staff - directly and,
where appropriate, via employee representative bodies — is important
and embedded in our work practices. On a quarterly basis, we brief
our staff about Shell’s operational and financial results through various
channels, including electronic communications from the Chief
Executive Officer, webcasts, publications and face-to-face gatherings.

The Shell People Survey is one of the principal tools used to measure
employee engagement: the degree of affiliation and commitment to
Shell. It provides insights into employees’ views, and has had a
consistently high response rate. The average employee engagement
score in 2012 was 77% favourable, a three-point increase from 2011.

We promote safe reporting of views about our processes and
practices. Our global telephone helpline and website enable
employees to report, confidentially and anonymously, breaches of the
Shell General Business Principles and Code of Conduct.

Diversity and inclusion

We have a culture that embraces diversity and fosters inclusion. By
embedding these principles in our operations, we have a better
understanding of the needs of our varied customers, partners and
stakeholders throughout the world and can benefit from a wider talent
pool. We provide equal opportunity in recruitment, career
development, promotion, training and reward for all employees,
including those with disabilities. We make adjustments in job design
and provide appropriate training where possible for any existing
employee who becomes disabled.

We actively monitor representation of women and local nationals in
senior leadership positions, and have talentdevelopment processes to
support us in delivering more diverse representation. At the end of
2012, the proportion of women in senior leadership positions was
16.2%, compared with 16.6% in 2011, because of a small increase

in the number of senior leadership positions, while the number of
women stayed the same. In 42% of the countries where Shell
subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments are based, local
nationals filled more than half of the senior leadership positions,
compared with 34% of countries in 2011.

Employee share plans

Shell has a number of share plans designed to align employees’
interests with Shell’s performance through share ownership. For
information on the share-based compensation plans for Executive
Directors, see the “Directors’ Remuneration Report”.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) was introduced in 2005.
Conditional awards of the Company’s shares are made under the
terms of the PSP to some 15,000 employees each year. The extent to
which the awards vest is determined over a three-year performance
period. Half of the award is linked to the key performance indicators
described on page 8, averaged over the period. For the PSP awards
made prior to 2010, the other half of the award was linked to the
relative total shareholder return over the period compared with four of
our main competitors. For awards made in 2010 and onwards, the
other half of the award is linked to a comparison with four of our main
competitors over the period on the basis of four relative performance
measures. All shares that vest are increased by an amount equal to the
notional dividends accrued on those shares during the period from the
award date to the vesting date. None of the awards results in
beneficial ownership until the shares are delivered. Also refer to

Note 22 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements”.

RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN
Under the Restricted Share Plan, awards are made on a highly
selective basis to senior staff. Shares are awarded subject to a three-
year retention period. All shares that vest are increased by an amount
equal to the notional dividends accrued on those shares during the
period from the award date to the vesting date.

GLOBAL EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN
Employees in 50 countries may participate in the Global Employee
Share Purchase Plan. This plan enables eligible employees to make
contributions towards the purchase of the Company's shares ata 15%
discount to the market price either at the start or at the end of an
annual cycle - whichever date offers the lower market price.

UK SHARESAVE SCHEME
Eligible employees of participating companies in the UK may
participate in the UK Sharesave Scheme. Options are granted over the
Company’s shares at market value on a date normally not more than
30 days before the grant date of the option. These options are
normally exercisable after completion of a three-year or five-year
contractual savings period.

UK SHELL ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN
Eligible employees of participating companies in the UK may
participate in the Shell All Employee Share Ownership Plan, under
which monthly contributions from gross pay are made towards the
purchase of the Company's shares.

ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY

Our success in business depends on our ability to meet a range of
environmental and social challenges. We must show we can operate
safely and manage the effect our activities can have on neighbouring
communities and society as a whole. If we fail to do this, we may incur
liabilities or sanctions, lose opportunities to do business, our
reputation as a company may be harmed, and our licence to operate
may be impacted.

The Shell General Business Principles include a commitment to
sustainable development that involves balancing short- and long-term
interests, and integrating economic, environmental and social aspects
into our business decisions. We have rigorous standards and a firm
governance structure in place to help manage potential impacts. We
also work with communities, business partners, non-governmental
organisations and other bodies to address potential impacts and share
the benefits of our operations and projects.

Detailed data and information on our 2012 environmental and social
performance will be published in April 2013 in the Shell Sustainability
Report.

Safety

Sustaining our licence to operate depends on maintaining the safety
and reliability of our operations. We manage safety risk across our
businesses through controls and compliance systems combined with a
safety-focused culture. Our global standards and operating
procedures define the controls and physical barriers we require to
prevent incidents. For example, our offshore wells are designed with at
least two independent barriers to mitigate the risk of an uncontrolled
release of hydrocarbons. We regularly inspect, test and maintain
these barriers to ensure they meet our standards.

We continue to strengthen the safety culture among our employees
and contractors. We expect everyone working for us to intervene and
stop work that may appear to be unsafe. In addition to our ongoing
safety awareness programmes, we hold an annual global safety day
to give workers time to reflect on how to prevent incidents. We expect
everyone working for us to comply with our 12 mandatory Life-Saving
Rules. It employees break these rules, they will face disciplinary action
up to and including termination of employment. If contractors break
the Life-Saving Rules, they can be removed from the worksite.

Climate change

Growth in energy demand means that all forms of energy will be
needed over the longer term. With hydrocarbons forecast to provide
the bulk of the energy needed over coming decades, policymakers are
focusing on regulations that balance energy demand with
environmental concerns. The management of emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO,) will become increasingly important as concerns over
climate change lead to tighter environmental regulation.

We already assess potential costs associated with CO2 emissions
when evaluating projects. But in the years fo come, governments may
impose a price on CO, emissions that all companies will have to
incorporate in their investment plans, and may also require companies
to apply technical measures to reduce their CO, emissions. This could
result in higher energy, product and project costs. Currently enacted,
proposed and future legislation are also expected to increase the cost
of doing business. Furthermore, in our own operations, we are
working to understand the potential physical impact of climate change
in the future on our facilities and new projects. Shell, together with

reports.shell.com | Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 | 47
Business Review > Environment and society

other energy companies, has been subject to litigation regarding
climate change. We believe these lawsuits are without merit and are
not material to Shell.

‘As energy demand increases and easily accessible oil and gas
resources decline, we are developing resources that require more
energy and require advanced technology to produce. This growth
includes expanding our conventional oil and gas businesses, our oil
sands operations in Canada, our gas-to-liquids (GTL) business in
Qatar, and our global liquefied natural gas (LNG] business. As our
businesses grow and production becomes more energy intensive, we
expect there will be an associated increase in the direct CO,
emissions from the Upstream facilities we operate.

We are seeking cost-effective ways to manage CO, emissions and see
potential business opportunities in developing such solutions. Our
main contributions to reducing CO, emissions are in four areas:
supplying more natural gas; supplying more biofuels; progressing
carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies; and implementing
energy efficiency measures in our operations.

MGIATY SSINISNE |

Nearly one-third of the world’s CO, emissions come from power
generation. For most countries, using more gas in power generation
instead of coal can make the largest contribution, at the lowest cost, to
meeting their emission reduction objectives this decade. In combination
with renewables and utilisation of CCS, natural gas is essential for
significantly lower CO, emissions beyond 2020. With Shell’s leading
position in LNG and new technologies for recovering natural gas from
tight rock formations, we can supply natural gas to replace coal in
power generation.

We see biofuels as one of the most practical and commercially viable
ways to reduce CO, emissions from transport fuels in coming years.
Our Raizen joint venture in Brazil produces low-carbon biofuel from
sugar cane. We are also investing in research to help develop and
commercialise advanced biofuels.

The International Energy Agency has stated that CCS could contribute
approximately 19% of the CO, mitigation effort required by 2050. To
advance CCS technologies, Shell is involved in CCS projects including
the Quest project in Canada, the Mongstad test centre in Norway, and
the Gorgon CO, injection project in Australia. In 2012, we also
submitted a proposal for a project in the UK to store CO2 in a depleted
gas reservoir in the North Sea. During this important demonstration
phase, government support is essential, and initiatives such as the
United Nations’ acceptance of CCS as an offsetting activity under the
Clean Development Mechanism is a positive step in progressing such
technologies.

We continue to focus on implementing energy efficiency measures in

our operations. Shell has multibillion dollar programmes in place in an
effort to improve the energy efficiency of our operations. These include
our oil and gas production projects, oil refineries and chemical plants.

In addition, we work to help our customers conserve energy and
reduce their CO, emissions, including through the development and
sale of advanced fuels and lubricants.

The flaring, or burning off, of gas in our Upstream business contributed
to our overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. The majority of this
flaring takes place at facilities where there is no infrastructure to
capture the gas produced with oil, known as associated gas. Most of
the continuous flaring takes place in Nigeria, where the security
situation and lack of pariner funding had previously slowed progress


--- Page 43 ---

48

Shell Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 | reports.shell.com
Business Review > Environment and society

on projects fo capture associated gas. However, the Shell Petroleum
Development Company of Nigeria Lid (SPDC) made progress in
reducing flaring in 2012. Improved security in some areas of the
Niger Delta and stable co-funding from our partners meant SPDC was
able to continue its multi-year programme to install new gas-gathering
facilities and repair existing facilities damaged during the militant
crisis of 2006 to 2009. SPDC is working on projects to further reduce
flaring. Progress will depend on continued partner support, the local
security conditions and the development of an effective market for gas
in Nigeria.

We expect gas flaring from our Majnoon operations in Iraq to rise in
coming years as oil production increases while we evaluate with our
partners the most effective way to capture the associated gas. In the
south of Iraq we set up a joint venture to capture the associated gas
currently being flared from non-operated fields in Basrah province.

Spills

Large spills of crude oil, oil products and chemicals associated with
our operations can result in major clean-up costs as well as fines and
other damages. They can also affect our licence to operate and harm
our reputation. We have clear requirements and procedures designed
to prevent spills, and multibillion dollar programmes are underway to
maintain or improve our facilities and pipelines.

Shell business units are responsible for organising and executing oil
spill responses in line with Shell guidelines as well as with national
legislation. All our offshore installations have plans in place to respond
to a spill. These plans detail response strategies and techniques,
available equipment, and trained personnel and contacts. We are
able to call upon significant resources such as containment booms,
collection vessels and aircraft. We are also able to draw upon the
contracted services of oil spill response organisations, if required. We
conduct regular exercises to ensure these plans remain effective.

Shell is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment
Company, a non-profit industry consortium to provide a containment
response system for the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Shell is operating
the Subsea Well Response Project, an industry cooperative effort to
enhance global well-containment capabilities.

Shell also maintains site-specific emergency response plans in the
event of an onshore spill. Like the offshore response plans, these are
designed to meet Shell guidelines as well as relevant legal and
regulatory requirements. They also provide for initial assessment of
incidents and the mobilisation of resources needed to manage them.

In 2012, the number of operational spills of more than 100 kilograms
decreased to 204, down from 211 in 2011. As of the end of February
2013, there were three spills under investigation in Nigeria that may
result in adjustments to the 2012 data. The number of operational
spills of more than 100 kilograms for 2011 was updated to 211 from
207 to reflect completion of investigations into spills.

As previously noted, detailed data and information on our 2012
environmental and social performance will be published in April 2013
in the Shell Sustainability Report.

Although oil spills in Nigeria resulting from sabotage and theft of
crude oil remain a significant challenge, there are instances where
spills occur in our operations due to operational failures, accidents or
corrosion. SPDC has been working to reduce operational spills that
are under its control. It maintains a public website to track the

response, investigation and clean-up of every spill from its facilities
due to operational failure, sabotage or theft.

In 2011, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released
a study of oil spills in Ogoniland, where SPDC operated until 1993.
SPDC accepted the recommendations of the UNEP report, and has
established an independent scientific advisory panel to review SPDC
practices in the rehabilitation and remediation of oil spill sites in the
Niger Delta. In July 2012, the Federal Government of Nigeria
established the Hydrocarbon Pollution Restoration Project - an
essential first step to implement the recommendations of the UNEP
report. Since the release of the UNEP report, SPDC has undertaken a
range of interim activities in Ogoniland where it was free to do so,
including helping fund the provision of emergency water supplies and
installing permanent water facilities in one affected area, launching a
community health outreach programme across Ogoniland, and
cleaning up a number of sites where SPDC was granted access. The
response to the UNEP report will require a joint effort by all
stakeholders, and SPDC intends to play its full part.

Hydraulic fracturing

Over the last decade, we have expanded our onshore oil and gas
portfolio using advances in technology to access previously
uneconomic tight oil and gas resources, including those locked in
shale formations.

One of the key technologies applied in tight-oil and tightgas fields is
known as hydraulic fracturing, a technique that has been used since
the 1950s. It involves pumping a mixture of water, sand and chemical
additives at very high pressure into a rock formation, creating tiny
fissures through which oil and gas can flow. To protect and isolate
potable groundwater from hydraulic-fracturing fluids in the wellbore,
we line our tightoil and tightgas wells with steel casing and cement.
All of our oil and gas wells are expected to have two or more
subsurface barriers to protect groundwater. We monitor a wellbore’s
integrity during and, in many cases, after hydraulic fracturing. When
we acquire assets, we evaluate the assets’ wells for conformity with
our safety and operating principles, and put in place a plan with a
timeline for rectifying any inconsistencies.

We recycle or reuse as much water as we believe is reasonably
practical. We store, treat or dispose of water in accordance with
regulatory requirements.

To the extent allowed by our suppliers, Shell makes the material safety
data sheet information available for locations where wells are being
hydraulically fractured. Shell supports regulation to require suppliers
to release such information. The chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing
will vary from well to well and from contractor to contractor, but some
can be toxic. For that reason, we have stringent procedures for
handling hydraulic-fracturing chemicals in accordance with the design
and assurance processes described above. The formations into which
these additives may be injected are typically more than a thousand
metres below freshwater aquifers. Our procedures require that potable
groundwater must be isolated from well completion and production
activities. Moreover, we only use air, water or a water-based liquid
while drilling through the potable groundwater aquifer to a depth
considerably below the aquifer. The casing and cement are then put in
place before drilling is resumed and hydraulic fracturing is initiated.

In June 2012, methane was detected in a well and a stream in Tioga
County, Pennsylvania, USA. Shell plugged the well, halting the release
of methane to the surface. Our investigation determined that a well
abandoned in the 1930s was the likely conduit for the methane gas


--- Page 44 ---

and water that reached the surface. We are taking additional
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of abandoned wells
potentially being a conduit for methane to reach water sources.

There have been reports linking hydraulic fracturing to earth tremors.
Most seismic events occur naturally due to motion along faults under
stress in the earth’s crust. Some areas are more seismically active than
others. While more than 1.1 million wells in the USA have been
hydraulically fractured, there have been relatively few reported cases
of seismicity detected at the surface near the time and vicinity of such
operations. Shell analyses publicly available seismic, geologic and
geophysical data to determine historical seismicity in areas where we
plan to operate, and if seismic activity beyond historic levels is
detected, we will investigate and review our operations.

Some jurisdictions are considering more stringent permitting, well
construction or other regulations relating to fracturing, as well as local
bans and other land use restrictions. Such regulations could subject
our operations to delays, increased costs or prohibitions.

Oil sands

We are developing mineable oil sands resources in Alberta, Canada.
We use hot water to remove bitumen, which is a heavy oil. Tailings
are the residual by-products that remain after the bitumen is separated
from the mined oil sands ore. They are composed of some residual
bitumen, water, sand, silt, heavy metals, and clay particles. Tailings
are stored in an above-ground tailings pond or in mined-out pits.
Tailings contain naturally occurring chemicals that are toxic; we
monitor them continuously, assess their potential environmental
impact, and take measures to protect wildlife and to prevent
contamination of surface water and groundwater. The tailings
management areas at the Athabasca Oil Sands Project’s Muskeg River
and Jackpine mines cover an area of 24 square kilometres.

The land that is mined must be reclaimed — for example, through
revegetation or reforestation — to a capability equivalent to that which
existed prior to development, as required by the Alberta government.
When dried, tailings are blended and treated to produce material
suitable for use in land reclamation. We continue to work with the
Energy Resources Conservation Board of Alberta to ensure we meet
the requirements of Directive 074, a regulation which was introduced
in 2009 to reduce the amount of liquid tailings, thereby speeding up
land reclamation.

We also continue to work on tailings technology and collaborate with
research institutions and other operators to advance solutions and
ultimately accelerate the pace of land reclamation.

In late 2010, we found water at the bottom of a section of a pit at the
Muskeg River Mine. The water was confirmed to be saline and to
originate from an aquifer below the mine pit. We continue to work
closely with the local authorities and industry experts to develop a
permanent solution. Meanwhile, the water is contained within a
segregated area in the pit.

Exploration in Alaska

In 2012, Shell started a multi-year drilling programme in the Beaufort
and Chukchi seas off the coast of Alaska. We previously operated for
almost 50 years in Alaska, including in both these seas, until 1998.
We are therefore familiar with these shallow waters and the
hydrocarbon reservoirs beneath them, which are of relatively low
pressure. Our preparations to explore for oil in 2012 followed a
number of years of work to lay the foundations for the responsible
development of the area’s potential resources. We have worked

closely with regulators, local communities and other organisations to
develop what we believe are appropriate safeguards.

To prepare for drilling off the coast of Alaska, we have developed a
thorough oil spill response capability that includes capping and
containment equipment, and oil spill response vessels.

In 2012, we completed our top-hole drilling operations off the North
Slope. This was conducted safely, in accordance with permits and
regulatory standards. This work has prepared the ground for
continued drilling. However, there were challenges. For example,
during the first full-scale deployment test of our containment dome, the
dome was damaged. We have since put in place a comprehensive
plan to repair and modify the dome. We also experienced challenges
in moving our rigs to and from the area of operations.

In October 2012, the Arctic Challenger, a purpose-built oil spill
containment vessel, received U.S. Coast Guard certification and
classification from the American Bureau of Shipping, which was too
late for the 2012 drilling season. At the end of February 2013, the
final inspection by the U.S. Department of the Interior (Bureau of
Safety and Environmental Enforcement) was pending.

After successfully completing its role in supporting our 2012 Alaska
exploration programme, Shell’s Alaska drilling unit Kulluk encountered
a series of challenges posed by severe weather and mechanical issues
with its tow ship while on its way to Washington State for
maintenance. These incidents caused the Kulluk to run aground off the
southern coast of Alaska, before being successfully moored off the
coast of Kodiak Island. This occurred after completion of our
exploration programme and did not involve drilling operations. We
are cooperating with the U.S. Coast Guard investigation and are
carrying out a detailed assessment of the vessel.

We have decided to pause our exploration drilling activity for 2013 in
Alaska’s Beaufort and Chukchi seas to prepare equipment and plans
for a resumption of activity at a later stage. Our exploration in Alaska
is a long-term programme that we intend to pursue in a safe and
measured way.

Water

Global demand for fresh water is growing while access to fresh water
is becoming more constrained in some parts of the world. It is
estimated that, by 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population will live
in areas where the demand for fresh water exceeds the available
amount or where the water's poor quality restricts its use.

‘As world energy demand rises, the energy industry is becoming one of
the larger industrial consumers of fresh water globally. Shell’s water
footprint may expand in the future with the development of
unconventional resources, such as shale oil and gas, oil sands, and
our biofuel business. A combination of increasing demand for water
resources, growing stakeholder expectations and concerns, and
water-related legislation may drive actions that affect our ability to
secure access to fresh water and to discharge water from our
operations.

At our oil sands operations in Canada we use far less than our water
allocation from the Athabasca River, and we minimise the amount
withdrawn during the winter months, when the flow rate is low. We
also reduce the amount of fresh water needed in operations by
recycling water from the tailings ponds. About 80% of the water we
use is recycled, and we are investigating new ways to further reduce
fresh water intake.

Our Pearl GTL plant in Qatar does not take fresh water from its arid
surroundings and water produced in the GTL manufacturing process is
recycled in the operation.

Biofuels

The international market for biofuels is growing, driven largely by the
introduction of new energy policies in Europe and the USA that call for
more renewable, lower-carbon fuels for transport. Shell predicts that
biofuels will increase from 3% of the global transport fuel mix today to
more than 10% by 2050. Sustainable biofuels are expected to play an
increasingly important role in helping to meet our customers’ fuel
needs and reduce CO, emissions.

Sustainability challenges exist with today’s biofuels. These include:
CO, emissions that vary according to the raw materials, production
and distribution processes used; competition with food crops for
available land; and labour rights.

We are one of the world’s largest biofuels distributors. We include our
own long-established sustainability clauses in our supply contracts and
where possible, we source biofuels that have been certified against
internationally recognised sustainability standards. These clauses are
designed to prevent the sourcing of biofuels from suppliers that may
not abide by human rights guidelines, or that may have cleared land
rich in biodiversity.

We are also developing our own capabilities to produce sustainable
biofuel components. The Raizen joint venture produces approximately
2 billion litres annually of ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil — the most
sustainable and costcompetitive of today’s biofuels. This ethanol can

reduce CO, emissions by around 70% compared with gasoline, from
cultivation of the sugar cane to using the ethanol as fuel.

The joint-venture agreement includes developing joint sustainability
principles, standards and operating procedures that also apply to
third-party suppliers. We also continue to work with industry,
governments and voluntary organisations towards the development of
global sustainability standards for biofuels.

We continue to invest in developing more advanced biofuels for the
future. These new technologies will take time to reach commercial
scale. Government support will be required to accelerate their speed
of development.

Environmental costs

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws, regulations and
reporting requirements in the countries where we operate. Infringing
any of these laws, regulations and requirements could result in
significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines, sanctions, and third-
party claims, as well as harm our ability to do business and our
reputation.

Our ongoing operating expenses include the costs of avoiding
unauthorised discharges into the air and water, and the safe disposal
and handling of waste.

We place a premium on developing effective technologies that are
also safe for the environment. However, when operating at the
forefront of technology, there is always the possibility that a new
technology brings with it environmental impacts that have not been
assessed, foreseen or determined to be harmful, when originally
implemented. While we believe we take all reasonable precautions to
limit these risks, we are subject to additional remedial environmental
and litigation costs as a result of our operations’ unknown and
unforeseeable impacts on the environment. Although these costs have
so far not been material to Shell, no assurance can be made that this
will always be the case.

In this regard, as oil and gas fields age, it is possible in certain
circumstances for seismic activity to increase based on the unique
geology of individual fields. For example, after more than 60 years of
developing the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands, seismic
activity has recently increased leading to measurable earth tremors.
Our Dutch joint venture is currently reviewing its operations, in
consultation with Dutch authorities.

Neighbouring communities

Gaining the trust of local communities is essential to the success of our
projects and operations. We have global requirements for social
performance — how we perform in our relationship with communities.
The requirements set clear rules and expectations for how we engage
with and respect communities that may be impacted by our operations.
For all major installations and new projects we appoint a person who
is responsible for assessing social impacts and finding ways to
mitigate them. In addition, we have specific requirements for
minimising our impact on indigenous peoples’ traditional lifestyles,
and on handling involuntary resettlement and grievance issues.
