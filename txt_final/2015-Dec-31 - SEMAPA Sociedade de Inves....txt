1. Macroeconomic Background

The world economy grew at a slower pace in 2015 (3.1% vs. 3.4% in 2014, World Economic Outlook, FMI, January
2016), behaving differently according to the geographic areas.

The USA and the United Kingdom were among the developed economies showing a favourable evolution. UK GDP
grew 2.2% in 2015 (World Economic Outlook, FMI, January 2016). The USA is undergoing moderate economic growth;
in 2015 GDP grew approximately 2.5% and the unemployment rate continued to fall to 5%. Inflation was lower due to
the fall in oil prices. This framework lead to the FED raising its policy rates in December 2015 to levels ranging from
0.25% to 0.5%.

GDP growth in the Euro area accelerated from 0.9% in 2014 to 1.5% in 2015. Inflation was close to 0%, which caused
the ECB to lower its policy rates again and to implement new quantitative easing measures.

China's growth rate slowed down, with less exports and imports, partly based on less investment and industrial
activity, nonetheless at significantly high level and playing a proportionally decisive part in overall growth. Such
developments, and market concerns about the performance of the Chinese economy in the future, are impacting
other economies through trade channels and lower commodity prices, as well as less trust and increased volatility in
the financial markets.

The slowdown was even more visible in other less developed economies, which were hindered by external demand,
political tensions and uncertainties and other cyclical factors, particularly commodity price developments in the
international markets. The evolution of oil prices, in particular, caused economies to behave differently, depending on
whether they are mostly importers or exporters. Oil prices have taken a sharp fall since September 2015, reflecting
expectations of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for sustained growth of production, while
global production still largely exceeds oil consumption.

In 2015, the US Dollar appreciated markedly vis-a-vis the Euro and the main Latin-American currencies. Emerging
country currencies were affected by the ongoing fall of commodity prices, and the outflow of capital to the developed
countries.

As for the Portuguese economy, GDP growth was around 1.6 % in 2015, as a result of the favourable behaviour of
exports. The unemployment rate remained persistently high and inflation reached an all-time low.

Overall, the year featured a build up of uncertainties, including that arising from growing geopolitical tensions in
different parts of the world. Very low levels of growth are expected to persist, and this together with deflation
prospects in several developed economies like the EU and Japan threatens to weaken the economic growth prospects
for the world economy. Three core factors continue to impact the global outlook: (1) gradual slowdown and
rebalancing of the economic activity in China, (2) lower energy and other commodity prices, and (3) gradual tightening
of the US monetary policy, against easing of the monetary policy by central banks.

the positive impact of the increase in selling prices for paper and pulp, which has already been mentioned.

Cement: 85.4 million euros #8 14.7%

EBITDA in the cement business area stood at 85.4 million euros, which translated into an increase of 14.7% in relation
to 2014. The EBITDA grew essentially as a result of operations in Portugal, where this indicator increased 7.2 million
euros.

The increase in the EBITDA in Portugal resulted from the positive development of the domestic market, subsequent
growth in sales and the persistent reduction of operating costs.

In 2015, the EBITDA margin stood at 17.9%, 0.6 p.p. up from that recorded in the previous year.
Environment: 8.1 million euros 48 109.6%

EBITDA in 2015 in the environment area stood at approximately 8.1 million euros, which represented a growth of

1 The integration of the Supremo Group in the Semapa consolidated financial statements for 2015, taking into account that the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the Group that
forced the full consolidation occurred at the end of the month of June, had the following impact: 50% of the results of the first half were integrated using the equity method, the
balance sheet position was fully consolidated (100%) with reference to 30 June 2015 and the results in the second half (July to December) were also fully consolidated (100%).

Holdings (Semapa SGPS and instrumental sub-holdings)

The EBITDA of the holdings had a negative impact of 5.3 million euros, comparing unfavourably with the positive
amount of 3.2 million euros in 2014, essentially due to the increase in personnel costs. It should be noted that this
increase resulted from the reclassification of balance sheet gratuities paid in the first half of 2015, as decided at the
Annual General Meeting for the approval of the 2014 accounts held in April 2015, for personnel costs by virtue of the
accounting standards in force requiring that these payments be recorded as results applied to staff costs.

3.2. OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS OF THE PAPER AND PAPER PULP BUSINESS
AREA

Turnover of the Portucel Group in 2015 was 1.6 billion euros, up by 5.6% compared with the amount recorded in the
previous year, resulting essentially from the favourable change in pulp and paper prices (in the context of the
valuation of the US dollar vis-a-vis Euro). The incorporation of the tissue business in the universe of the Group's
consolidation helped to boost growth. Paper sales accounted for 75% of turnover, energy 12%, pulp 9% and tissue
approximately 3%.

Consumption of uncoated woodfree printing and writing paper (UWF) in Europe declined only slightly (around 0.3%),
while exports grew as a result of the favourable behaviour of the USD exchange rate. Taking advantage of the positive
exchange rate development, Portucel expanded sales in the USD-based markets, recording an increase of around 1.7%
of sales volume in these markets. The Group’s average sales price saw a very positive change, increasing 5% in relation
to 2014, which helped paper sales in 2015 to grow 4.0%, above 1.2 billion euros, and achieve the highest value ever. In
the same period, the benchmark index in Europe, PIX A4- Copy B, fell 0.6%. In volume terms, this slight drop of 0.6%
was essentially due to the effort put forth in replenishing stocks, the levels of which were very low, and to the
increase in volume in transit to customers.

Management Report 10 of 54
S Semapa

Report and Accounts 2015

The bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp (BEKP) business maintained the positive performance it has demonstrated since
the first of the year, with a significant improvement in prices over the same period of 2014. In fact, the price index in
dollars experienced a favourable variation, with an average price of 784 USD/ton, compared to the 746 USD/ton figure
in the same period of the previous year The exchange rate effect contributed to the sharp rise in the price in euros,
and the reference index PIX BHKP reached an average of 705 euros/ton, an increase of 25.6% compared to the
previous year. The upward trend in pulp prices resulted in growth of 23.2% in the value of sales, despite a reduction of
approximately 1.7% in the amount sold.

The reduction in the volume of pulp sales in 2015 resulted essentially from the reduced availability of pulp for sale,
due to the stoppage of the Cacia mill, while work was being done on the capacity expansion project. Representing a
20% increase in installed capacity, this project was successfully completed and the Cacia mill resumed production in
late June. Output figures have been consistent with the anticipated learning curve as the mill moves towards stability
at the new target output levels established for the project: 350,000 tons per annum of BEKP.

The production and sale of energy were affected by the maintenance stoppages in Cacia, Setubal and Figueira da Foz.
Consequently, gross annual production of the Group was 4.2% below the figure in 2014, which, alongside the drop in
invoiced amounts, determined 16.1% decrease in electricity sales to the grid. The lower energy prices of the natural
gas co-generation plants were influenced by the reduction in the price of Brent and the EUR/USD exchange rate. One
might add that, at the end of the year, the natural gas co-generation plant in Figueira da Foz was impacted negatively
by the reduction in energy sales price, as laid down in Decree-Law 23/2010, altered by Decree-Law 68-A/2015.
Therefore, starting 2016, the plant will be operating for self-consumption.

In the tissue business, the AMS sales volume of products and goods recorded growth of around 6% compared to the
previous year, made possible by the increased production capacity for conversion into finished product. September
was marked by the completion and successful start-up of the second machine for reel production, which doubled
production capacity from 30,000 to 60,000 tons per annum. The increase in amounts sold, together with the slight
improvement in average sales price, resulted in a 9% increase in tissue sales, amounting to 55.8 million euros.

The EBITDA of Portucel Group has evolved favourably to 390.0 million euros, which represents an increase of 18.7%
compared to the previous year. The EBITDA margin stood at 24%, 2.7 p.p. up from the previous year. In addition to the
results generated by the Group's current operations, the figure for EBITDA also includes a surplus of 8 million euros on
AMS operations and also a negative figure of approximately 10.9 million euros relating to the impact of future
business operations - including the project in Mozambique and the pellets project in the United States, both still in the
investment phase. Furthermore, the implementation of the anti-dumping rate in the United States resulted in a
negative impact of 3.8 million euros.

This evolution reflects the positive impact of the increase in selling prices for paper and pulp, which has already been
mentioned. On the production factors side, raw material costs have improved significantly. The Group's supply mix
featured an increase in the share of domestic wood, to the detriment of wood from the Spanish market. This change,
combined with the optimisation of the cost of logistics and improved specific consumption, triggered a positive
development in the main cost item, although the need for significant wood imports from South America remains.

Personnel costs increased 34.2 million euros, arising essentially from some non-recurrent factors, like payments to the
Pensions Fund, increased redundancy settlement costs regarding compensation under the ongoing rejuvenation
program, and the cost estimate for the 2015 performance bonus. Personnel costs also reflect the increase in the
Group's workforce, namely with the project in Mozambique (228 employees at year-end) and AMS staff inclusion
costs.

Operating results represented a clear improvement, growing by 31.8% to 267.6 million euros.

The financial results in 2015 amounted to a negative 50.3 million euros, which compares with a negative value of 34.2

Management Report 11 of 54
S) Semapa
Report and Accounts 2015

million euros in 2014. The main difference is due to the recognition of the costs associated with the early redemption
of part of the Portucel Senior Notes 5.375% retail bond issue. Two hundred million euros (out of a total loan of 350
million) were repaid. The redemption price paid was the nominal value of the Redeemable Notes, plus the applicable
premium, amounting to approximately 14.6 million euros. This early redemption also resulted in the immediate
recording of around 2.3 million euros of costs incurred with the issue of this loan. Financial costs will reduce
significantly as a result of such repayment, as the Group negotiated simultaneously a new loan issue for the same
amount (200 million euros) in better terms and extended maturity. The financial results include the cost of operations

of exchange coverage contracted for 2015 (around 6.8 million euros).

The consolidated net income for the year stood at 185.3 million euros, representing growth of 4.8% in relation to the

same period in the previous year.

3.3. BUSINESS REVIEW

3.3.1. Paper

3.3.1.1. Market Background

Figures in 2015 point to a slight decline in apparent consumption of UWF in Europe of 0.3% in relation to 2014, whilst
the main benchmark index for UWF prices (PIX A4-Copy B) was down by 0.7% year-on-year. In this environment, as
already observed throughout the year, the weakness of the Euro against the Dollar drove the European industry to
look for more profitable opportunities, boosting the volume of exports and consequently reducing the volume sold to
the European market. The production capacity utilization rate stood at close to 92%, one and a half percentage points
up from the previous year, whilst order books in the industry were 1.3% fuller than in 2014.

In the US, the apparent consumption of UWF paper had dropped by 0.4% until November, with the significant
reduction in imports of 12.1%, as a result of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports from China, Australia,
Brazil and Portugal. Nonetheless, the industry's capacity utilization rate was 93%, one percentage point below the
previous year's figure. The leading price index for the sector (Risi 20Ib A4) fell by 1.8% in relation to the same period in
the previous year, in line with the trend since 2010, dropping 12% in total since the highest price recorded that year.

UWF Sales 1,555 1,564 -0.6%
Foex — A4-B copy Euros / ton 822 827 -0.6%

In this context, in 2015 the Portucel Group achieved an all-time high in paper sales, 4% more than in the previous year,
supported by rising sales in foreign markets of 1.7% in volume and 14.5% in value, with continued expansion into new
regions and growing penetration in Latin America and Africa. Sales in Europe were cooler, mostly as a result of the
greater focus on USD-denominated markets that contributed more.

3.3.1.3. Branding

In 2015 the Portucel Group continued to focus on its own brands.

The Navigator brand continued to lead the market in the premium segment office paper in 2015, with sales growing by 2.4%
globally.

Management Report 12 of 54
S) Semapa
Report and Accounts 2015

The annual EMGE — Paper Industry Consultants study among wholesale professionals rated Navigator again as the leading
brand in Europe, both in terms of spontaneous awareness and Brand Performance, obtained through the weighted average
of several technical and marketing features. This was the 10th consecutive survey to have rated Navigator the top brand in
Western Europe.

Due to its outstanding performance over the last years, the Navigator brand has earned the title of "World's Best Selling
Premium Office Paper", selling in more than 110 countries.

With a unique formula, Discovery is today the best-selling brand of 75g/m? office paper in Europe. It should be
highlighted its performance in Latin America in the last year. It is currently available in over 60 countries worldwide.
Furthermore, the Discovery brand occupies second place for the first time regarding spontaneous knowledge and
came in seventh in terms of Brand Performance in the 2015 EMGE study.

The Pioneer brand also managed to be in the top-20 brands with more spontaneous knowledge in the annual study
conducted by EMGE with merchants, besides the fact that it came in fourth as far as Brand Performance is concerned.

3.3.2 Pulp

3.3.2.1. Market Background

The recovery which started in the 4th quarter of 2014 continued in 2015, with the paper pulp market benefiting from
several factors, namely new capacities coming online at a slower pace, a reduction in supply due to the traditional
maintenance stoppages and strong demand from the Chinese market. The activity slowed down at the end of the
year, due to the strong pressure on commodity prices and less economic growth in China, the main export destination
of pulp.

These market developments in 2015 helped prices to keep on rising, and the average of the PIX benchmark index rose
5.1% against the previous year, from USD 746 to USD 784. In euros, and influenced by the exchange rate effect
motivated by the deterioration of the Euro against the Dollar, the price variation was more significant, as is seen in the
chart below, rising from 114 euros since the beginning of 2015.

As reported above, the Chinese market remained the main driving force behind demand. PPPC W-20 figures for pulp
sales to this market in 2015 point to an overall increase of 11.0%, with eucalyptus pulp growing by 14.1%.

The Group's BEKP pulp sales totalled approximately 253 thousand tons in 2015, with an improved position in the
decorative and special papers segment, which accounted for more than 75%.

3.3.3 Tissue

3.3.3.1. Market Background

The Group intervenes in two market segments for the tissue business area: Household (At Home), which accounts for
75% of the total market, and Professional (Away From Home), supplying an array of products in both segments. The
sales strategy focuses particularly on the Iberian market, while developing other markets with great potential, in
Europe and Africa mostly.

This is the result of the Group's expansion plans, which now include a strong growing business segment, where it will
gradually introduce its business model.

The tissue paper market represents in Western Europe approximately 6.4 million tons, Germany and the United
Kingdom leading the way of countries with the highest consumption rates per capita and over 2 million tons per year
in total. The European market has grown, on average, around 1.3%/year over the past 10 years.

Toilet paper and paper towels are the most representative product categories across Western Europe, whereas the
utilisation rate of paper napkins and paper tissue is higher in Southern Europe and Central and Northern Europe,
respectively.

In terms of results, the tissue business sales reached approximately 55.8 million euros, representing a growth of close
to 9% over the previous year, 52% of which was generated through the Household channel, while the remaining 48%
was originated through the Professional channel.

The occupation rate of the paper machines reached 95%, which compares favourably with an average of 88% of other
producers in Western Europe.

3.4. INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

In 2015, 1.4 million tons of air dry pulp and 1.6 million tons of paper were produced. Pulp production was 0.4% more
than in the previous year and paper production grew by 1.1% against 2014, reaching the highest volume so far.

Of all three pulp plants of the Portucel Group, Figueira da Foz stood out for having met the record high of 580
thousand tons of pulp. The Cacia plant owes its lower production, in comparison with 2014, to the annual stoppage
that took longer than usual, during the implementation of the previously announced capacity increase project.

Paper production at the two Setubal plants broke the barrier of 800 thousand tons of finished goods for the first time.

The levels of efficiency of the industrial equipment, in most cases, grew significantly, as the result of a consolidated
strategy of ongoing improvement.

The quality of the industrial assets, good maintenance and good knowledge of production procedures were the core
factors leading to the results achieved.

Operating costs had a positive performance globally.

The cost of wood, the main input in pulp production, dropped 4.1% compared with 2014, due to a decrease in the
specific consumption of wood by 1.3% and more favourable average price.

The cost of chemicals used in pulp production was also down by approximately 2%, in spite of the rise in costs at the
Cacia Plant for the aforementioned reasons.

The increase in the variable costs of eucalyptus fibre, the main input, impacted paper production. The cost of
eucalyptus fibre used to produce paper grew 17% in relation to 2014. In an integrated process, which is the case of the
Group's plants, such cost increase is transformed into a benefit for pulp production.

The costs of chemicals and energy used in paper production remained largely untouched.

Under the fixed cost component, maintenance costs at the Portucel Group developed unfavourably, 5.2% above the
previous year. This was caused essentially by the annual stoppage of the Figueira da Foz mill and the irregular
performance of the Cacia Mill. On the other hand, maintenance costs at the Industrial Complex in Setubal developed
favourably, having dropped 5.4% since 2014.

Regarding tissue production in 2015, Vila Velha de Roddo reached 30,019 tons of paper and 35,346 tons of finished
goods in total, which translate an increase of 12.6% and 7.5%, respectively, against 2014.

As for the main variable costs of paper production, short fibre and long fibre, both purchased from external entities,
prices increased significantly compared with 2014, 16% and 2% respectively. The synergies arising from the
integration in the Group prevented further rise in the purchase price. There were no significant variations in energy
costs translated in €/ton in comparison with the same period of 2014.

3.5. DEVELOPMENT

Concerning industrial investment, the output capacity of the Cacia pulp mill grew. Representing a 20% increase in
installed capacity, this project was successfully completed and the Cacia mill resumed production in late June. Output
figures have been consistent with the anticipated learning curve as the mill moves towards stability at the new target
output levels established for the project: 350,000 tons per annum of BEKP.

In March 2015, the Group announced its entry in the tissue segment through the purchase of the company AMS — BR
Star Paper - based in Vila Velha de Rodao, Portugal. It was purchased for the amount of 41 million euros, with
approximately 24 million euros of debt taken up by the Group, and the completion of the plan to increase tissue paper

Management Report 15 of 54

Report and Accounts 2015

production capacity, which involved an additional investment of 36 million euros. The new capacity began operating in
September, and included a second production machine with 30 thousand ton capacity, as well as the new
transformation capacity of over 20 thousand tons. At the end of 2015, the nominal capacity of the Vila Velha de Rodao
unit amounted to 60 thousand tons of reels and 64 thousand tons of transformed goods.

In addition to the acquisition of AMS, the Group stepped up its efforts to pursue alternative areas of growth outlined
in its strategic plan. Portucel intends to invest in a tissue paper production line and the corresponding transformation
into a final good, with a nominal capacity of 70 thousand tons per year at an estimated value of around 121 million
euros. However, the decision to invest will depend on several assumptions, including the approval by AICEP of the
application to the Portugal 2020 programme under assessment, which will grant funding and/or tax allowances.

The construction project for the pellet factory in the USA continues at a good pace, specifically through the
consolidation of the project team now working in Greenwood, South Carolina. The civil construction work got under
way in early August 2015. Work started on the foundations and buildings where the main equipment has already been
fitted, and mechanical installation work is due to be completed in April 2016 The commissioning and trial operation
period will start in May, with production planned to start up in July. Contracts have already been awarded for
approximately 96% of the investment total.

During the year, the initial amount estimated at 110,8 million USD was reviewed upwards to 116.5 million USD, and
the plant's nominal production capacity grew from 460,000 tons to 500,000 tons a year.

Portucel also continues to make progress with the forestry production project in Mozambique. In 2015 the Group
pressed ahead with its new forestry plantations.

In an important milestone, Portucel Mocambique successfully obtained the environmental license needed for forestry
operations in Zambézia and Manica provinces.

The construction of the Lua Nurseries, in Zambézia province, was also completed, for the production of cloned
saplings on an industrial basis, with capacity for 6 million plants a year in the first year, which has doubled meanwhile.
The nursery's official opening took place in the beginning of September; it was attended by some managers of the
Portucel Group, the President of the Republic of Mozambique and representatives of the International Finance
Corporation.

In spite of the unfavourable weather conditions, with flooding at historical levels in the beginning of the year and
extreme drought throughout the remainder of the year, it was possible to keep up planting operations, albeit at a
slower pace than expected.

Finally, the organisation was adjusted to the acceleration of operations, with the completion of the construction of the
housing centre for some Staff located in Zambézia (in Nipiode).

In this context, in 2015 capital expenditure totalled approximately 152.3 million euros, including 67 million euros in
the pulp and paper business (42 million euros of which were in the Cacia expansion project), 36 million euros in tissue
capacity expansion at the Vila Velha de Rodao plant, 18 million euros in the Mozambique project and 32 million euros
in the construction of the pellet mill in the United States.

3.6. RESOURCES AND SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS

3.6.1. Sustainability

Sustainable Development is one of the key pillars of the Portucel Group and it is paramount for the success of present
and future business. In 2015 the Group took important steps in the management model, in particular:

Management Report 16 of 54

J

Semapa

Report and Accounts 2015

Redesigning of the mission by committing to “Becoming a global company, known for transforming, in an
innovative and sustainable way, the forest into goods and services that contribute to human welfare”.

Establishing a new Sustainable Governance model under a newly formed Sustainability Directorate and the
Sustainability Forum.

Consolidating the pillars of the growth strategy, in particular the creation of value, the sustainable
management of resources and environmental preservation, the creation of lasting employment, the promotion
of quality of life and social well-being.

Considering the context, the following projects and initiatives in particular were developed in 2015:

Design of the Portucel Mocambique Social Development Programme. Developed over a time horizon of 7
years, by 2015 this programme had delivered direct support to 4,600 households, in 6 districts of the Zambézia
and Manica provinces, including farming activities.

Investment in better process technology for the Cacia Industrial Complex, fostering better environmental
performance, on a par with the creation of value by increasing productive capacity.

Progress in the Group's sustainability reporting through the adoption of the G4 version of the GRI - Global
Reporting Initiative, which encourages stakeholders to deliver their feedback on important topics for reporting,
i.e. on the most relevant issues for the development of the Group's business.

Social Responsibility exercised though the volume of jobs created, the professional qualification of Staff and
local development initiatives and community support. Job creation is a cross-cutting and critical issue for the
construction of a strong and inclusive Europe. In Portugal, the Portucel Group is supplied by more than 5,000
companies from several sectors of the economic fabric and it is responsible, either directly or indirectly, for
generating 30,000 jobs.

Consolidation of the supply of certified timber (FSC® or PEFC) or timber of controlled origin to the plants, thus
keeping up with the previous period's sales levels of FSC®, PEFC or Ecolabel premium graphic and office
stationery.

Active presence in leader organisations for promoting corporate sustainability, BCSD Portugal - Conselho
Empresarial para o Desenvolvimento Sustentdvel at the national level and WBCSD — World Business Council for
Sustainable Development at the international level. BCSD Portugal published a case-study of the Group in the
field of low-carbon economy: “Portucel Group: Low Carbon by Nature” included under the climate change
theme. On the international stage, the Portucel Group's CEO was appointed to co-chair of WBCSD's Forest
Solutions Group (FSG), which works to promote global solutions and good practices in the forestry products
industry.

Therefore, in 2015 the Portucel Group consolidated its role in building a more sustainable future in cooperation with

all of its business partners.

3.6.2 Forestry and Timber Supply

Sustainable Management

At the end of the year, the Group's agro-forestry holdings covered 120 thousand hectares, divided into almost 1,400

management units distributed over 167 municipalities and 609 parishes in the country. Fifty-four per cent of assets
managed are on property owned by the company and approximately 73% of the area under management consists of

eucalyptus stands or ongoing plantations of this species.

Management Report 17 of 54
S Semapa

Report and Accounts 2015

Forestry operations in 2015 were held back at lower levels than in the previous year, due to the weather conditions,
unsuited for much of the year to planting out eucalyptus. A total of 2,8 thousand hectares were forested or reforested
by the end of the year and 3 million selected eucalyptus saplings were planted out.

Regarding forest preservation and improvement measures, over 12.6 thousand hectares were controlled for
spontaneous vegetation and around 8 thousand hectares for stem cuttings selection. Fertilisation measures were also
conducted on approximately 12.2 thousand hectares and around 4,900 km of tracks and paths were maintained or
improved.

In 2015, approximately 618 thousand m’ of eucalyptus timber was extracted and shipped to the Group's destinations
(99.5% of which was certified wood).

In 2015, investment in fire prevention amounted to around 3 million euros, with emphasis being placed on
prevention, mitigation and Research & Development measures.

For the Portucel Group the forest is one of the most important pillars supporting its business, as owner and manager
of forest holdings, adopting responsible planning and management best practices, subject to a set of principles and
rules that reconcile environmental, social and technical-financial concerns.

Assuming forest certification as a means to enhance its presence in the increasingly demanding international market
regarding the origin of the raw materials of its products and to respond to society's legitimate worries, in 2015 the
Group managed to secure its certificates under two internationally acknowledged programmes, the FSC® and the
PEFC, having renewed the PEFC certificate in accordance with the new Portuguese regulatory framework. These
certificates cover products like eucalyptus wood for paper and pulp production (the Group's main output) and cork,
hereby having its responsible management of forest holdings being confirmed by independent entities. The Group's
certified area — which grew more than 20 thousand hectares in a little over 5 years — includes all holdings on mainland
Portugal and corresponds to a significant share of all Portuguese certified forests (33% FSC and 47.5 % PEFC).

Timber suppliers

Timber supply in a competitive market is a critical factor for the Group. The supply of eucalyptus wood on the Iberian
market fell short of the consumption needs. Raw material consumption in the three industrial facilities reached 4.3
million m?. Supply amounted to 4.3 million m’, 75% of which from Portugal, including self-supply, 11% from Spain and
14% from outside the Iberian market: Uruguay, Brazil and Chile. Supply cost savings amounted to more than 14 million
euros in comparison with the previous year.

In the pursuit of its Policy of Corporate Responsibility and engagement with its local communities, the Group
remained committed to the Certification of Forest Management and of the Chain of Custody.

Of all timber supplied to the plants, 40% was certified and 60% was of protected origin. In Spain, where the supply of
certified wood is strong, 80% of the purchased timber was certified.

In addition to the certification prize, the first to be awarded worldwide, the Group continued to promote forest
certification measures and of the Custody Chain with suppliers and owners' associations.

Furthermore, it has been working with suppliers, owners and service providers for the sharing of knowledge in best
forestry practices, thus increasing the productivity of private eucalyptus forests.

The woodchip market in Europe, and especially in the Iberian Peninsula, has undergone significant development in
recent years and global shipping of this commodity has increased.

3.6.3 Energy

The Portucel Group recorded gross power output of 2,291 GWh in 2015, slightly down by 4.2% on the previous year.
This figure for total power output corresponds to approximately 4.8% of the total power generated in Portugal.

The production and sale of energy were affected by the maintenance stoppage and an extensive overhaul of one of
the turbo-generators of the Cacia mill, and the maintenance stoppage in the last quarter of one of the turbo-
generators of the renewable co-generation of the Setubal plant, which had a significant effect on the energy balance
of this plant. The natural gas cogeneration at the Figueira da Foz Industrial Complex, in the last quarter of the year
also underwent planned maintenance stoppage.

The electric power generated by biomass power plants (3 cogeneration units and 2 other plants) totalled 1,158 GWh,
slightly down by 4.8% on the previous year, and accounting for more than 50% of estimated total Portuguese power
output from this renewable resource in 2015. The drop in electrical power generated from this primary source of
energy was due to the aforementioned reasons of repairing the turbo-generators of the renewable cogenerators in
the Cacia and Setubal plants.

The two new biomass power stations, dedicated solely to generating electricity, contributed a total gross output of
216 GWh, with sales to the national grid of 186 GWh, well in excess of the initial expectations for the project, which
were for 167 GWh. Following some maintenance of the Cacia Plant, the latter improved its performance significantly
compared with 2014, with production increasing 23%. This success was due essentially to high standards of stability
and performance in operation and maintenance, and better control of biomass bought abroad.

The new combined-cycle natural gas cogeneration plant in Setubal contributed to gross output of 642 GWh (up by
1.5% on the previous year), achieving a new record high in production. The cogeneration plant has reached a stability
level after a number of adjustments and changes were made to it in respect of some of the mechanical components of
the natural gas turbines, in order to improve its availability.

The combined-cycle natural gas cogeneration plant at the Figueira da Foz Industrial Complex, fully consolidated in the
Group's accounts since 2013, produced 432 GWh in 2015, 10.7% less than in the previous year due to the extended,
programmed maintenance and regulatory changes concerning the development of power sold.

Despite the increase in power generation from natural gas, due to the energy needs of the Setubal and Figueira da Foz

Management Report 19 of 54
S) Semapa
Report and Accounts 2015

paper mills, 50.5% of the Group's electrical power production was derived from co-generation plants and power
stations fuelled by biomass, i.e. a renewable resource. It is important to note that co-generation combines the
production of electrical power with much larger quantities of thermal energy, making it considerably more efficient
than conventional processes which generate only power.

Bioenergy and Fossil Fuels

The two biomass power stations at the Cacia and Setubal Industrial Complexes and the Group's three biomass co-
generation plants have allowed it to consolidate its dominant position in the Portuguese renewable energy market.
The great benefit in terms of reduced CO, emissions will have an impact on the national balance for these emissions
and will reduce the country’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, a national aspiration which the Group is
accordingly helping to achieve. These plants of the Portucel Group are expected to cut CO, emissions by more than
460 thousand tons compared to the national average.

The Group has continued to supply its biomass reception centres, including those located at its plants, allowing it to
optimize further the operation of the chipping equipment used to process the biomass as well as the logistics involved
in biomass operations.

Several measures were implemented in 2015 to improve the levels of humidity and aggregates content of several
types of residual biomass purchased, improving the correlation between humidity levels and biomass acquisition cost.

Forest Biomass for Energy Purposes

The year 2015 developed along the same lines as the previous years, with high biomass supply, particularly leftovers
from the forest activities. The biomass power stations of Cacia and Setubal were supplied with approximately 317
thousand tons of biomass, not including bark.

3.6.4 Environment

In 2015 plenty of thought was put into the development of a strategic environmental plan. This plan is intended to
prepare the Portucel Group for the next 10 years, namely for the challenges arising from the new requirements in this
field, which have either been published or are being prepared, including the conclusions on the best technologies
available for the sector and the Large Combustion Plants. The development of the plan highlighted the fact that
current performance is already in conformity with such guidelines, it helped to point out areas for improvement,
technological solutions and setting up action plans.

Furthermore, strong investment was made in the environmental area in the Group's industrial facilities, and in the
collection and treatment system of non-condensable gases, the new washing press in the bleaching stage and the new
lime kiln at the Cacia Industrial Complex, besides the investment in a washer for concentrated non-condensable gases,
which are used as a source of energy in the lime kiln at the Figueira da Foz Industrial Complex.

The investments mentioned helped to improve the environmental performance of the Portucel Group, both in terms
of air and water emissions and the rational use of sources.

In order to honour the commitments made in the Management Systems Policy and the Sustainability Policy, the
Portucel Group identifies, monitors and controls the environmental aspects of its operations, with the aim of
eliminating or minimizing impact, by implementing practices based on strict compliance with legislation and the
principle of ongoing improvement.

Management Report 20 of 54
S) Semapa
Report and Accounts 2015

Environmental indicators continued to present sustained positive performance at all industrial units, due to the
improvements to processes which have been consistently implemented in various areas: air, water, waste, energy and
materials.

With 2009 as the reference year, improvements to processes translated into environmental gains, per ton of product,
pulp and paper produced, namely 9% less water used and approximately 7% less primary energy consumption.

Water and air emissions per ton of goods produced evolved favourably, down by 14% and 31% in the same period.

In addition to the aforementioned reductions, the stabilisation of the Group's performance in line with the sector's
top technologies must be highlighted.

3.6.5 Innovation, Research and Development

The Group is known for focusing on the development of innovative products, not only in terms of intrinsic quality, but
also of consumer segmentation, which continued to receive particular attention in 2015.

In 2015 the Directorate for Innovation and Internal Consulting was created, whose main mission is to foster
programmes and projects applied across the Portucel Group, addressing matters relating to Innovation, Lean
Manufacturing and the program management of internal projects. It is informally linked with the company's different
business areas, developing specific governances for each of the subjects mentioned above.

In 2015, the Group continued to invest in research in forestry, pulp and paper, through the work of its forestry and
paper research institute, RAIZ, conducted in close cooperation with the Group's respective business sectors and a
range of bodies in the national and international science and technology sector.

The main contributions of RAIZ in Forest Research and Consulting were (i) the onset of the production of the improved
seed at the orchard in Espirra; (ii) the incorporation of new materials in the Genetic Improvement Programme; (iii) and
the support lent to the PSF for the review of the fertilisation programme, the irrigated eucalyptus project and the
implementation of a more precise model for estimating forest productivity.

The main contributions of RAIZ in Forest Research and Consulting resulted in the completion of two QREN Projects in
the areas of new cellulosic materials and the new bio-based products, as the predecessors of chemical synthesis bio-
industry and biomaterials from lignocellulose renewable sources.

In connection with environmental research, sludge production and management, in particular, are a growing concern
due to the amounts generated and the present management cost thereof, the growing pressure and the
environmental requirements in this field. In 2015, significant progress was achieved in the search for technological
solutions to drying sludge and biomass for the Group's three industrial units to assess the technical-economic
feasibility, in view of using it for energy production and efficiency gains.

4.3. OVERVIEW OF THE CEMENT AND DERIVATIVES BUSINESS AREA

Financial year 2015 for Secil in Portugal, as in the previous year, was expected to be subject to uncertainties, much
due to the economic situation of the building industry in Portugal and the relevant developments. The other markets
where the Group operates, Tunisia and Lebanon, although not in recession, are limited by other instability factors,
including political and social turmoil, with not always predictable developments constraining activities. In the case of
Angola, the negative effects of oil price developments and the difficulties felt since the end of 2014 in processing
payments abroad as a result of the foreign-exchange restrictions imposed by the National Bank of Angola, paint a
rather negative image for the construction and public works sector.

In 2015 the entire share capital of Supremo Group was bought. At the end of June 2015, the Semapa Group, through
its subsidiary NSOSPE - in which Secil held 49.9% of the share capital - purchased the remaining share capital of
Supremo Cimentos, S.A.

After the Supremo Group integrated the Secil Group, the Group's installed cement capacity grew by approximately
two million tons, thus playing an important part in the Secil Group's operations and results from 2015 onwards. The
construction project of the new plant of Adriandpolis, in Brazil, was concluded in April; the clinker line began
producing on 3 April and the cement mill on 19 April.

In 2015, the turnover of the Cement and Derivatives business area was 476.7 million euros, 11.0% higher than the
figure in the previous year. This increase was mainly due to the growth in turnover of operations in Portugal, Lebanon
and Angola, and the integration of the Supremo Group on 1 July 2015.

EBITDA in the cement business area stood at 85.4 million euros, which translated into an increase of 14.7% in relation
to 2014. In 2015, the EBITDA margin stood at 17.9%, 0.6 p.p. up from that recorded in the previous year. The EBITDA
grew essentially as a result of operations in Portugal, where this indicator increased 7.2 million euros.

Operating income stood at 23.4 million euros, as compared with the figure of 24.4 million euros recorded in the
previous year, due to an increase in the EBITDA mentioned before, which was offset by the increase in depreciations

and impairment losses.

The Group recorded a financial loss of 41.7 million euros, a significant drop against the negative figure of 14.7 million
euros in 2014. The net cost of financing increased, mostly due to the integration of the Supremo Group with high
financing costs, the investment made in the new Adrianopolis plant and the high interest rates charged in Brazil.

Consolidated net income in 2015 totalled -25.3 million euros.

grew by 55.2%, specially due to market growth and the construction of the Mardo Tunnel in Portugal. The Aggregates,
Mortar and Pre-cast segments together also increased against the previous year's figure, which stood at 20.1%.

The share of turnover from total operations outside Portugal and from exports by Portugal-based operations
decreased: 63.7% as compared to the figure of 65.8% recorded in 2014.

EBITDA in the Cement and Clinker segment in 2015 grew by 1.1% in relation to 2014. The Ready-Mixed concrete
segment and the other segments achieved a positive EBITDA.

The geographical breakdown shows that the share of EBITDA for total operations in Portugal increased in relation to
the previous year, with these operations accounting for 40.5% of total EBITDA in 2015.

4.4. BUSINESS REVIEW

4.4.1. Portugal

4.4.1.1. Market Background

After a 0.9% growth in GDP in 2014, a 1.6% growth is seen for 2015 (Bank of Portugal - December 2015 Economic
Bulletin). In 2015, construction continued its unstable behaviour, some of the business indicators in the sector
improving, whilst others declined. According to the latest figures available from FEPICOP, the Portuguese Construction
and Public Works Industry Federation, in the 1st half of 2015, building investment grew 4.7% year on year. While the
core indicators in the housing segment recovered, public works dropped by 38%.

In November 2015, the construction production index (INE — the Indices of Production, Employment and
Remuneration in Construction — November 2015) was down by 2.4%, on a year on year basis. The Building and Civil
Engineering sectors both registered a decline in the aggregate index, presenting both a drop of 2.4%. Although these
indices continue to fall, the year-on-year variation has decreased, extending the trend of less negative numbers in the
construction sector.

In this adverse environment, the Secil Group presented the following overall indicators for its operations in Portugal in
2015:

4.4.1.2. Cement and Clinker

According to the latest figures available, cement consumption in Portugal was up by 5.1%, for the first time since
2008. It is thus estimated that the market reached approximately 2.7 million tons (CEMAPRE — the Centre for
Mathematics Applied to Forecasts and Economic Decision).

Cement sales by Secil in the Portuguese market were in line with this trend, standing at 1,048 thousand tons, 2% more
than in 2014. Generally speaking, monthly growth in sales was recorded throughout 2015. Overcapacity in Portugal
and Spain remained unchanged, creating a competitive environment in the domestic market.

White cement manufactured by Secil was used in a number of high-profile construction projects, including: the
headquarters of the Santander Lisboa Bank building — expansion, at the Vila Real University — Classroom building of
the School for Life Sciences and Environment, the Health Care Centres of Abrantes and Vila Nova de Gaia and grey

Output of the Hydroelectric Plants of Salamonde (II) and Venda Nova (Ill), new Fire Station in Braga, Leroy Merlin —
Braga, Jer6nimo Martins - Distribution Centre North — Alfena, Valongo, etc.

In the international markets, the European Industry, which is equally overproductive, caused a higher level of
competition. In the external market, countering the trend seen in previous years, sales decreased in relation to 2014.
Cement and clinker sold amounted to 1.57 million tons, which is 301 thousand tons less than in the previous year.

Cement and clinker business in Portugal, including sales in Portugal and exports, recorded turnover of 154.9 million
euros, down by 10.7% in relation to the figure for the previous year.

As already mentioned, this decrease reflected the drop in the export business, which showed a drop in turnover of
19.3%, and the decrease in turnover in the domestic market of 2.0% over the same period in 2014.

The EBITDA reached 28.5 million euros, 9.4% less than the figure recorded in 2014, as a result of thermal and electrical

energy cost reduction.

Less fuel costs resulted from the increase in the amount of fossil fuels replaced with alternative fuels and lower fuel
prices. The Group has also increased the use of industrial waste as thermal fuel. Overall, the rate of use of alternative
fuels went from 41% in 2014 to 46% in 2015. Efforts and investment in this area continue to be a priority, in order to
obtain a higher rate of use of alternative fuels, with consequent savings in energy costs.

Electrical energy cost reduction resulted from lower energy price, and mostly from greater efficiency in operations,
which helped to reduce consumption.

The cement produced at the Secil Group's three plants in Portugal continues to present fairly uniform final
characteristics and high quality standards, an aspect which is regarded as essential to ensure general market
recognition of the high standards set by Secil.

Operational performance in 2015 was quite positive, having improved the efficacy of output management and
reduced clinker and cement production costs below 2014 levels.

Sales of ready-mixed concrete grew the most, 57.1% more than in the previous year. The year featured the supply of
concrete to the Mardo Tunnel project, unrivalled project in recent years. The rest of the market also grew over the
previous year, and the estimated growth of the ready-mix market on mainland Portugal is 13%, of which the Mardo
Tunnel project is accountable for 10%. This particularly impacted sales on the mainland, which is accountable for the
largest share of sales of ready-mixed concrete of the Group in Portugal, since sales in Madeira were down by 29% due
to overcapacity and the slowdown in building activity.

EBITDA of this business unit stood at around 3.3 million euros, representing a clear improvement in relation to the

4.4.2 Lebanon

4.4.2.1. Market Background

According to the latest figures published by the IMF, the Lebanese economy is expected to have grown by 2% in 2015,
as was the case in 2014 (World Economic Outlook, IMF, October 2015).

Lebanon is still feeling the impact of the global slowdown and regional instability, especially with the situation in Syria.
The Syrian crisis and the influx of refugees continue to overshadow the short-term outlook on Lebanon, exacerbating
the long-running political weaknesses and vulnerabilities there. Despite this situation, there are expectations of
modest economic growth.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Lebanon in 2014 and 2015:

4.4.2.2. Cement and Clinker

In regard to cement consumption in 2015, there has been a significant drop. The market fell by 8.6% as a result of the
slowdown in the construction sector due to the unstable environment in the region, and the adverse weather
conditions in the first quarter of 2015. The construction business, according to the data available (Blominvest Bank),
dropped 11.76% in the first ten months of 2015, a trend that has been ongoing since 2011 and which was aggravated
by the political insecurity and unrest. The cement industry has also been impacted by the decrease in public
investment in infrastructure works by the Portuguese government. The demand for cement was also negatively
impacted by the rise in the demand for small housing projects, including in the Beirut and Mount Lebanon regions,
which are considered the most attractive for land and housing development.

In this context, the sales volume in the cement business unit in Lebanon decreased, totalling 1,133.8 thousand tons,
down by 8.9% on the previous year, with all sales being made on the domestic market.

In 2015, turnover stood at 87.5 million euros, up by 6.2% compared with the same period of the previous year, due
fundamentally to the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro, since the competitive environment in the market
is increasingly challenging, as reflected on the average sales prices in the local currency, which dropped. Decreasing
demand and projects and the subsequent rise in competition caused discount levels to rise.

EBITDA reached 34.8 million euros, 18.3% more than the figure recorded in 2014. In 2015 production improved its
performance. No clinker was purchased in 2015, which helped to raise margins. Production costs were also lower than
in 2014, due to less spending in thermal energy, as a result of the overall decrease in fuel costs, with more favourable
effects as from the second half of 2015, and due to the replacement of 4.5% with 6% petcoke. Fixed costs also
decreased compared with the previous year, due to lower maintenance costs.

Industrial Operations

Annual cement output from the Sibline plant stood at 1,162 thousand tons. Clinker output recorded an all-time high of
1,007 thousand tons, representing an increase of 5.9% over the previous year, mostly due to improved performance in
production. Clinker production grew and production indicators also improved (average daily clinker output and the
kiln utilisation factor increased).

4.4.3 Tunisia

4.4.3.1. Market Background

In Tunisia, after the political transition, the economic transformation required to ensure sustained growth remains to
be concluded. The year 2015 was marked by trade union claims, terrorist attacks, and ongoing political instability, thus
hampering economic recovery.

According to the latest figures published by the IMF, the Tunisian economy is expected to grow by 1% in 2015, below
the 2.3% figure registered in 2014 (World Economic Outlook, IMF, January 2016). In Tunisia, the economy remained
fragile and growth was insufficient to bring high levels of unemployment down. The IMF will continue to help Tunisia
to implement its economic programme through financial support, policy advice and technical assistance.

In 2014, specially from June onwards, cement demand on the domestic market contracted, due to the recession in the
residential and commercial construction and public works industry. This trend worsened in the first half of 2015 and
recovered in the second half. The market is estimated to have dropped approximately 0.4% in relation to 2014.
Competition on the Tunisian market is growing and pressure on sale prices is high, with the consequent drop in local
market prices. Installed capacity is higher than cement demand, particularly aggravating competition in sales prices on
the domestic and the export markets.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Tunisia in 2014 and 2015:

4.4.3.2. Cement and Clinker

Secil cement sales were down over 2014 and sales volume decreased 11.6%, impacted by declining sales on the
domestic market, down by 24.6%, partially offset by export sales, which increased significantly. Domestic market sales
decreased, as a result of the unfavourable competitive framework and the social and industrial unrest, which made it
difficult to operate the mill during some periods of the year (occasional stoppages due to strikes).

Following an increase in the beginning of 2015, the price of cement sold on the domestic market dropped at the end
of February to levels below that in January 2014. This price reduction resulted from the reduction in the prices of most
other operators.

Despite the increase in supply and competition, in the export market sales increased in comparison with 2014, with
129 thousand tons sold. This rise was brought about by lower prices than in the previous year, due to competitive
pressure on prices. This increase also resulted from the rise in the monthly exports authorised by the Tunisian

government, compared to 2014. Libya was the main export destination. However, in spite of the growth in sales,
political unrest has been a big challenge.

The turnover of the cement business unit amounted to approximately 62.4 million euros, down by 8.4% over the
figure for 2014, due to less sales on the domestic market, partially offset by the rise in export volume. The
appreciation of the Tunisian dinar against the euro by approximately 3.4% produced a positive impact.

In 2015, the cement unit recorded EBITDA of 11.2 million euros, 34.8% below that recorded in the previous year. This
drop was largely due to decreased sales on the domestic market and less clinker produced as a result of the strikes.
The variable costs of clinker production were identical to that in the previous year, with a slight decrease. The energy
gains helped to improve thermal energy consumption indicators in comparison with 2014, due to the decrease in gas
used (as a result of the investment made in 2014 in the petcoke feed to the pre-heater to replace natural gas). The
cost of electrical power, on the other hand, was largely the result of the rise in electric power price.

Industrial Operations

Cement output stood at approximately 1.2 million tons, 12.9% down on the output recorded in the previous year.
Clinker output reached 943 thousand tons, 5.4% less than in the year before. Total production in 2015 was affected by
strikes of external staff working in the quarry, which resulted in a drop in kiln output and occasional stoppages.

Capital expenditure

Investment amounted to 2.2 million euros, and included the installation of a concrete station to supply the second
stage of the motorway project connecting Gabés to Medenine, which required the installation of a station on the
construction site.

overall unstable economy. The drop was more significant in the Sfax region, motivated by less public and private
works. In addition to the shrinking market, the drop in sales also reflects enhanced competition, with two new
operators in the market, one in Sfax and another in Gabés. The appreciation of the Tunisian dinar against the euro by
approximately 3.4% produced a positive impact.

4.4.4 Angola

4.4.4.1. Market Background

The outlook for 2015 is moderately favourable and although the IMF is forecasting growth of 3.5% for Angola in 2015
(World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2015), the impact from the recent variations in the price of oil cannot help but
affect the economy over the course of this year. The steep drop in international oil prices, on which tax revenue is
strongly dependent (around 75%), impacted tax performance 2015. This situation had organisations review growth
forecasts for 2015 downwards. Less revenue caused the kwanza to depreciate sharply vis-a-vis major world
currencies, inflation to rise and difficulties in foreign payments.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Angola in 2014 and 2015:

Angola Turnover EBITDA Quantities Sold

Total 24.2 21.7 11% 1.4 1.1 -224%

4.4.4.2. Cement and Clinker

The cement market in Angola was not immune to these difficulties and domestic consumption in 2015 decreased by
around 8.8% year on year, standing at 5.2 million tons. This amount was almost entirely supplied by cement produced
in Angola, since the Joint Executive Decree No. 01/15 of 05 January, adopted by the Government, established a cap for
all cement imports in 2015. This decree limited the effect of the market downturn on domestic producers, however
cement output capacity is currently higher than needs, resulting in oversupply.

The amounts sold by Secil Lobito grew by 8.2% compared to the previous year; 200 thousand tons were sold, 15
thousand tons more than in 2014, countering the market trend. This growth was influenced by the stoppage during a
part of the year in a competitor, which faced financial problems and whose installed capacity represents 17% of the
production capacity in Angola.

CEM | 42,5R cement, with increased value added, reached record sales levels, accounting for 28.4% of sales, which put
Secil Lobito in a stronger position regarding the production of differentiated, high-resistance cements.

Turnover grew by 11.2% and stood at 24.2 million euros, due to the combined effect of greater quantity and higher
sales price. In 2014 sales prices dropped significantly, while in 2015 they increased 5%. As was expected, in virtue of
the deterioration of the margins of national producers due to the depreciation of the kwanza (increased cost of all
imported materials) and the rise in fuel prices (diesel for producing electric energy and fuel oil for thermal energy).

However, in spite of the adjustment in sales prices, the rise in cost was marked, causing the profit of national
producers to deteriorate.

The turnover of our operations in Angola was negatively affected by the depreciation of the kwanza against the euro
by 630 thousand euros.

The EBITDA was up compared with the previous year, when it was less 1.1 million euros, amounting to 1.4 million
euros in 2015. This improvement was due to the increase in turnover, the maintenance of variable costs and the cuts
in staff costs.

Regarding input costs, the variable costs remained unchanged, in spite of the increase in the cost of clinker imports.
The fixed costs also dropped, due to staff costs that decreased as a result of Workforce cuts. In the late 2015, the
Workforce amounted to 211, representing a reduction of 16 Employees; staff costs were cut by around 15%.

Capital expenditure

Investments in 2015 totalled 665 thousand euros (down by 47% against 2014), of which around 365 thousand euros
were used to build walls and fences around the company's properties to prevent illegal occupations.

4.4.5.1. Market Background

The economy of Brazil was significantly affected by the political instability, tax adjustments and a number of
proceedings/inquiries which received plenty of media coverage in 2015. The combination of these events produced a
great deal of uncertainty about which way the economy would go, making expectations difficult to manage. In this
scenario, there was a strong deterioration of the major macroeconomic indicators, specifically: a decline in the GDP,
the currency depreciation and an increase in the interest rates in order to control the inflationary pressure.

Economic agents expect GDP to have dropped around 3.8% and inflation to have reached 10.7%. Interest rates
increased several times to 14.25% and the behaviour of the exchange rate is still unstable. Recent IMF projections also
point to a contraction of the Brazilian economy of 3.8% (World Economic Outlook-Update, IMF, January 2016).

Recent information (SNIC — January 2016) about the cement market in Brazil suggest a drop in the market of around
9.2% year on year; in the South and South-East (Supremo Group markets) the fall may have been slightly below the
average. Added to the economic situation and the decrease in investment, the entry of new operators made the
market even more competitive.

In 2015, total operations by the Supremo Group generated turnover of 60.0 million euros, representing an increase of
around 10.2% in relation to the previous year. Limited production capacity in the first three months of the year and
problems in importing cement precluded higher growth in sales. Such constraints were offset at the end of April when
the Adriandpolis plant began production and the average daily sales volume increased.

When the Adriandpolis plant went into operation, some of the operating costs and financial expenses (interest on
loans) that were being capitalised previously began to be recognised directly in the results, in accordance with the
applicable accounting standards. This had the corresponding (negative) impact on the EBITDA, which registered a
negative figure of 1.4 million euros, significantly lower than in the previous year, and on the financial results of the
Supremo Group which were a negative 25.5 million euros at the close of 2015 vs. the negative 4.7 million euros in the
previous year.

Consequently, net income in 2015 totalled the negative figure of 24.4 million euros, which translates a loss of
approximately 22.7 million euros year on year, as a consequence of the increase in debt and interest rates and
currency depreciation.

At the end of 2015, net debt of the Supremo Group amounted to 121.0 million euros, which translated a decrease of
47.6 million euros compared to the figure on 31 December 2014, mostly due to the currency exchange.

size of the plants and a totally different operating structure. The new plant consumes less thermal and electric power
than other plants, fostering better performance of the variable costs, in addition to producing better quality clinker,
which helps to reduce the amount of clinker added to the cement. Consequently, unit costs of production reduced
significantly.

Capital expenditure

Capital expenditure by the Supremo Group in 2015 stood at 58.5 million euros, mostly related to the completion of
the new cement mill project in Andrianopolis.

4.5. RESOURCES AND SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS

4.5.1. Sustainability

Sustainability is a strategic issue for the management of the Secil Group, which is why it is committed to participating
in the CSI — Cement Sustainability Initiative, under the WBCSD — World Business Council for Sustainable Development,
namely through the measures for redesigning the priority goals and establishing the most suitable structure for their
fulfilment, in the context of the rejuvenation of the CSI.

Furthermore, Secil's CEO participated in the drafting of and outspokenly supported the Low Carbon Partnership
Initiative for the cement industry, the WBCSD's input to the Paris Agreements.

The following steps have been taken in the cement business unit in Portugal:
= The alternative fuel substitution rate rose slightly to 45%, allowing further substitution of fossil fuels;

= The total rate of clinker incorporation in cement was down to 75.5% in 2015, from 77.0% in 2014, which was
due to the decrease in the rate of all types of cement, and the drop in the volume of exported cement,
namely the more resistant type;

=" Carbon emissions went down from 656 kg of CO’ released per ton of cement products in 2014, to 620 kg of
CO, per ton of cement products in 2015, lower than the set target (629 kg of CO, per ton of cement
products), reflecting the lower proportion of clinker incorporated in cement and the reduced specific
emission factor at the Secil-Outdo plant;

= Carbon emissions of all 3 plants together were lower than the licences granted by the Portuguese
Government under the NIMs — National Implementing Measures for allocations 2013-2020.

4.5.2. Environment

The cement industry has proven its commitment by reducing carbon emissions. It was the first industry to deliver a
roadmap of progress against the targets for a low carbon economy (Cement Technology Roadmap — Carbon emissions
reductions up to 2050), jointly published by the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) and the International Energy
Agency (IEA) in 2009.

In 2013, the European Cement Association (CEMBUREAU) published a roadmap of the European cement industry,
titled “The role of Cement in the 2050 Low Carbon Economy”.

Secil participated actively in the drafting of these two documents as member of the CSI and the CEMBUREAU.

In the latter of the two documents mentioned above, CEMBUREAU proposed to reduce CO, emissions by 32%
compared to a 1990 baseline, using proven conventional technologies. Such reduction may increase to 80%, as soon
as ground breaking technologies, such as the Carbon Capture and Storage/Use (CCS/U), become technically and
economically viable.

In July 2015 the European Commission (CE) tabled a proposal to revise the Directive on the European Carbon Dioxide
Emissions Market (EU-ETS), which will have to be adopted in co-decision with the European Parliament and the
European Council.

The EU-ETS should be an incentive for investment, growth and the creation of jobs, allowing the cement industry and
the equivalent to foster innovative solutions in shaping the Europe of tomorrow. Therefore, the proposal submitted
should protect the more efficient facilities in the European market from competition by non-European manufacturers,
which are not subject to proportionate restrictions for reducing CO, emissions, and foster competition between

Management Report 37 of 54
S) Semapa
Report and Accounts 2015

European producers for exporting outside Europe. Consequently, it should ensure technically viable emission
reduction rates, while guaranteeing affordable energy prices.

However, the proposal of the EC does not provide for these two situations and, if it is not changed, it will burden the
more efficient facilities with undue costs, up to 30% of the Gross Value Added.

The EP and the European Council will assess the proposal in 2016 and the EC is also available to discuss its details.
Either individually or as a member of the CEMBUREAU, Secil undertakes to ensure that it is reviewed fairly and
realistically by the relevant entities.

Nevertheless, we recall that under the Paris Agreements (definitely the biggest event in 2015) the negotiating
conditions are expected to deteriorate further for the sectors covered by the EU-ETS. We believe that a greater effort
is needed to support those areas that are not included, namely the carbon efficiency of buildings and infrastructures,
to which the cement industry can contribute significantly, by providing concrete construction solutions of proven
sustainability.

4.6. ORGANIZATION

The priorities set in 2012 and 2013 for the implementation of an activities adjustment and rationalisation plan in
Portugal are still reflected in 2015 financial year for all units. Although most of the measures for reducing costs and
maximising efficiencies had been implemented by 2012 and 2013, in 2015 plants continued their efforts to streamline
and pursue excellence in the different procedures. Improved efficiency is one of the Group's main priorities in all
geographical regions, and not only in Portugal. The various operational units have continued to pursue a series of
initiatives/projects of this type, with the aim of improving their profitability and the efficiency of procedures.

Sales - used food oil 1 000t 1.9 1.8 6.7%

5.3. OVERVIEW OF THE ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS AREA

The ETSA Group recorded turnover of approximately 27.6 million euros in 2015, up by around 4.9% vs. 2014.

This favourable development was essentially caused by the consolidated provision of services amounting to 11.5
million euros, mostly due to (i) the amounts of animal carcasses collected, under the SIRCA service delivered to the

Management Report 39 of 54
S) Semapa
Report and Accounts 2015

Portuguese government, and (ii) the increase in the average value of contracts per store for collection of animal by-
products from hypermarkets in Portugal.

Consolidated sales over the relevant period amounted to approximately 16 million euros, dropping around 8.0% in
relation to the previous year. This change is mostly due to the decrease in fat sales of around 26.3%, compared to the
same period in 2014 (arising from the combined 13.9% drop in amounts sold and decrease of around 14.4% of its
average sales price). The decline in fat sales was partially offset by sales of blood meal (about 0.9 million euros in
2015), the production and marketing of which began at the end of 2014.

EBITDA for the ETSA Group totalled approximately 8.1 million euros in 2015, reflecting an increase of about 109.6% in
comparison with the previous year. This is explained fundamentally by the progressive and selective reduction in the
average cost of goods sold per ton of raw material processed.

The implementation of Phase II of the Programme for Structural Cost Reduction and the overall reduction in the cost
of thermal and mineral fuels used in the industrial conversion process and transport of by-products, respectively, as a
result of the investment made and of the drop in oil prices, produced a positive impact on the period's performance.

The financial results were a negative 0.9 million euros, lower than in the previous year, arising particularly from the
repricing of the applicable loan terms.

The combined impact of these factors resulted in Net Income attributable to equity holders of the ETSA Group for
2015 of approximately 3.8 million euros.

6. Semapa Group Human Resources

The Semapa Group’s human resource policy is geared to continuous improvement in productivity by developing
Workforce skills and expertise, in conjunction with streamlining and rationalization.

A commitment to a highly skilled workforce, with specialized professional careers, continues to be one of the key
features of the Group’s human resources policy, reflected in professional development and training activities and
programmes.

The Workforce of the Semapa Group went from 4,668 at the end of December 2014 to 5,621 at the end of December
2015, as shown in the following table:

31-12-2015 31-12-2014 Var.

Cement 2,647 2,034 613
Environment 287 285 2
Holdings 25 24 1
Total 5,621 4,668 953

The increase in the Paper and Paper Pulp and Cements and Derivatives areas is essentially the product of staff hired
for the new businesses and Supremo, respectively.

7. Social Responsibility in the Semapa Group

Helping to sustainably develop its local communities is one of the strategic principles guiding the Semapa Group. The
Group has been aware at all times that sustainable growth depends on the well-being of its Workforce, and on the

support and ties it builds with the communities around its production units and commercial premises.

The Group is accordingly involved in a wide array of projects designed in the last instance to improve the quality of life

of the communities around its plants and facilities, and to preserve the environment.

Taken together, donations by the Semapa Group to welfare charities totalled approximately 2.2 million euros in 2015.

The following were some of the numerous initiatives and projects supported by the Group:

Cooperation agreements with institutions working in the fields of social inclusion, sport and the arts, with
programmes in the local communities around the Group’s facilities.

Pera Project: supported by the Group since 2013/ 2014 school year, the project pays for the breakfasts of
pupils with food shortage at the schools in the catchment areas of the Group's plants. The partnership with
the Ministry of Education and Science supports the Eixo board of schools, Jaime Magalhdes Lima secondary
school, Vila Velha de Réddo board of schools, Figueira Mar - Figueira da Foz and the Ordem de Santiago
Setubal board of schools.

Floresta Segura: one of the Group's most important sustainability and social responsibility initiatives. With a
strong national impact, the project was developed jointly with the National Fire Fighting School since 2012,
and is aimed at reducing the number of fire events by raising the awareness about prevention. In 2015, close
to 15 sessions were held in the areas where the likelihood of fires breaking out is higher, for example in
Azambuja, Paredes and Monchique, and they aimed at teaching the rural population how to burn
undergrowth safely.

Paper grants: in 2015 grants were given out to schools and charities in the plants' catchment areas; 146
social, educational and cultural projects were donated up to 23,000 tons of paper. Furthermore, ongoing aid
is provided to the boards of schools of the communities around the Group's plants and facilities, which is
translated into fundamental support for the educational communities.

Support to the Salvador Association: an Association that works to defend the interests and rights of persons
with reduced mobility, especially individuals with motor disability.

Support to the Quinta Esséncia Association: a charity that helps people with intellectual disabilities to achieve
independence through the integrated development of their personal, social and vocational skills.

Support to SMDV Projecto Familia: a pioneering project in Portugal, seeking to work with families with
children at risk. The aim is to keep the family together through intensive, immediate and individualised
support.

Support to AMI - Assisténcia Médica Internacional and also to the Ronald McDonald Foundation, in both
Lisbon and Porto.

On 31 December 2015, consolidated net debt stood at 1,803.0 million euros, representing an increase of 417.3 million

euros over the figure recorded at year-end 2014, positively influenced by the creation of operating cash flow of

around 391.6 million euros and:

Pulp and paper: + 380.9 million euros, as a result of payment of dividends and reserves in the total amount of
440.5 million euros (310.5 million euros in May and 130 million euros in December), 98.2 million euros of
which were appropriated by minority holders of Portucel, and of the closing of the AMS acquisition process,
with a payment of 41 million euros. The capital expenditure totalled approximately 152.3 million euros,
including 67 million euros in the pulp and paper business (42 million euros of which were in the Cacia
expansion project), 36 million euros in tissue capacity expansion at the Vila Velha de Rddao plant, 18 million
euros in the Mozambique project and 32 million euros in the construction of the pellet mill in the United
States.

Cement: + 279.0 million euros, resulting essentially from investments in Brazil and the full consolidation of
the Supremo Group;

Environment: + 2.8 million euros; and

Management Report 43 of 54

=" Holdings: 245.3 million euros less, essentially due to the net effect of the dividends of around 342 million
euros received from Portucel and the dividends and reserves paid of 101.2 million euros (39.9 million euros in
May and 61.2 million euros in December).

8.2. FINANCIAL RESULTS

In 2015 financial results amounted to a negative figure of 122.3 million euros, down by 17.7% in relation to the figure
recorded in the previous year. The negative figure of 18.4 million euros was primarily the result of:

= Recognition of the costs (contractual premium) associated with the early redemption of part of the Portucel
Senior Notes 5.375% retail bond issue, in a total amount of about 14.6 million euros, as well as the
recognition of around 2.3 million euros associated with costs incurred with the issue of this loan, which at the
date of reimbursement were yet to be reflected in the results;

= The effect of acquiring the remaining 50% of the Supremo Group and the investment made in the new
Adrianopolis plant, which had an impact of around 20.3 million euros;

= Positive effect resulting from a decrease in interest rates and debt renegotiation.

8.3. RISK MANAGEMENT

Details of risk management may be consulted in the relevant section of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements (Semapa Group).

8.4. LISTED SHARE PRICE

In 2015, stock markets were impacted by severe volatility, due to several of the year's events, including central banks'
monetary policies, exchange rate development and, in particular, euro depreciation, the drop in oil price and
geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. However, the shares were still one of the financial assets
with the best yield in 2015 (2.20% average), exceeding the average yield of bonds and commodities.

European stock markets had a positive performance globally, with the German and Portuguese stock exchanges in
particular valuing around 10%, in spite of the events that impacted the domestic stock markets negatively, namely in
the banking sector.

Semapa stock set itself apart positively, having registered during the period in analysis a rise of 26.6%, above the PSI20
average. The Semapa stock value reached a high of 14.185 euros on 10 April, and a low of 9.755 euros on 7 January.

8.5. DIVIDENDS

In May 2015, Semapa distributed dividends with a total value of 39.9 million euros, corresponding to 0.375 euros per

share andi

n December 2015 it distributed free reserves of 61 million euros, corresponding to 0.75 euros per share.

In May 2015, Portucel paid dividends and distributed reserves totalling 310.5 million euros, corresponding to 0.433
euros per share. In December 2015, Portucel distributed in advance the earnings of 2015 in the amount of 30 million
euros, equivalent to 0.0418 euros per share, and earnings carried forward amounting to 100 million euros, equivalent
to 0.1395 euros per share, within the information included in the Voluntary General Tender Offer Prospectus dated 3
July 2015, as stated in Portucel’s communication to the market released on 23 November 2015.

Management Report 45 of 54

Report and Accounts 2015

8.6. NET EARNINGS

Consolidated net income in 2015 attributable to shareholders of Semapa was 81.5 million euros, which translated a
reduction of 27.7% in comparison with the previous year. Net income was 0.849 euros per share, which represents a
drop of 15.0%, lower in percentage than the absolute results due to the decrease in the number of shares.

This decrease is explained essentially by the combined effect of the following factors:

= An increase in total EBITDA of approximately 68.2 million euros;

= Increase in amortisations and impairment losses, resulting from the revised useful life of some industrial
equipment, the integration of AMS and the full consolidation of Supremo;

= Areduction of provisions with a value of 20.6 million euros, due essentially to the release of provisions which
proved to be unnecessary;

= Aworsening of net financial results by about 18.4 million euros, in relation to the previous year;

= An increase of about 64.9 million euros in income taxes, due primarily to the reversion of deferred taxes on
tax losses incurred by Semapa and to the termination of the Special Tax Regime for Company Groups applied
to Portucel and its subsidiaries, of which Semapa is a controlling company, due to the fact that, with the
settlement of the Public Exchange Offer made by Semapa, the legal requirement of holding a minimum stake
in order for that Special Taxation Regime of Company Groups to be applied to those companies, effective as
from 1 July 2015, is not met;

Following the decrease in Semapa's holdings in Portucel, after the completion of the Public Exchange Offer in July
2015, Semapa appropriated lower results from Portucel in the second half (69.40% versus 81.19%, previously).

The net results of the individual Financial Statements in 2015 came to a positive 236.0 million euros, as explained
next.

8.7. MAIN EFFECTS OF THE PUBLIC EXCHANGE OFFER ON THE CONSOLIDATED
AND INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS

In the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Public Exchange Offer was entered in the accounts as an acquisition of
own shares in the amount of 305 million euros, which produced a decrease in equity by that amount, and as a sale of
Portucel shares, which resulted in a capital gain of 165 million euros that was recorded in results carried forward, as
required by the implementation of the IFRS rules. The net impact of this operation on consolidated equity was
therefore negative, in the amount of 140 million euros.

On the Individual Statements, the net impact on equity was a negative 144 million euros: the acquisition of own
shares produced, as was the case in the Consolidated Financial Statements, a 305 million euro reduction in equity, and
the gain from the sale of Portucel shares, which came to a positive 161 million euros, was recorded in the results of
the period, as required by the application of the Accounting Normalisation System (SNC). The net results of the
individual Financial Statements in 2015 came to a positive 236.0 million euros, as shown before.

9. Highlights in 2015

GENERAL MEETINGS

On 30 April 2015, Semapa's Annual General Meeting approved the proposal for the reduction of its share
capital by 11,822,445 euros, from 118,332,445 euros to 106,510,000 euros, through the cancellation of
11,822,445 own shares.

The Extraordinary General Meeting of Semapa was held on 23 June 2015, at which 98.6% of the capital
present or represented voted favourably to approve the only two proposals presented by the shareholder
Sodim, SGPS, S.A.: a) Acquisition of a maximum of 48,461,924 own shares by Semapa, and each shareholder
who accepted this offer would receive 3.40 shares of Portucel for each Semapa share owned by it, and b)
Reduction of the share capital of Semapa, by up to 48,461,924 euros, through the cancellation of a maximum
of 48,461,924 own shares to be purchased according to the terms of the offer. The shareholders of 74.97% of
the share capital of Semapa were present or represented at the shareholders' meeting. After the public
exchange offer, which occurred from 6 to 24 July 2015, Semapa purchased 24.864.477 own shares, which
were cancelled as a result of the share capital reduction, which now stands at 81,645,523 euros, represented
by 81,645,523 shares. The Semapa Group reduced its stake in Portucel from 75.85% to 64.84% of the share
capital and from 81.19% to 69.40% of the non-suspended voting rights, the effect of which was the Portucel
Group's withdrawal from Semapa’s tax consolidation, thereby increasing the heading of taxes.

The Company's Board of Directors met on 1 July 2015 and approved, effective immediately, the co-opting of
Engineer Jodo Nuno de Sottomayor Pinto de Castello Branco to act as a member of the Board of Directors of
the company and his appointment as Chairman of the Executive Board, following Mr. Pedro Mendong¢a de
Queiroz Pereira’s resignation from this position. This decision was ratified by the Extraordinary General
Meeting (EGM) on 3 November 2015. The EGM also approved i) the election of a Director, Eng. Carlos
Eduardo Coelho Alves, to exercise non-executive functions, until the end of the current term of office for the
other company officers; and ii) the adjustment of the number of Semapa shares that correspond to one vote,
going from 100 shares to 83 shares as a result of the public tender offer carried and the corresponding
alteration in the share capital of the Company.

INVESTMENTS

In February 2015, Portucel S.A. purchased 99.87% of the tissue producing company, AMS BR — Star Paper S.A.,
Portugal, with a production capacity of 30,000 tons of tissue and 50.000 tons of converting. The company
completed its plan to double the tissue paper production capacity in September 2015. On 13 October, the
Portucel Group inaugurated two investments made in the Cacia and Vila Velha de Rddao plants, totalling 95.3
million euros, and announced a new investment of 121 million euros in Cacia, in a new tissue paper
production line with a capacity of 70 thousand tons per year, based on a set of assumptions, including the
approval by AICEP of the application to the Portugal 2020 programme for financial and/or tax incentives,
among others.

During the month of April 2015, Supremo Cimentos, S.A. completed the construction of a new integrated
clinker and cement plant in Adriandpolis, in the State of Parana, Brazil, which went into operation at the end
of April. The installed cement capacity of Supremo reached two million tons. At the end of June 2015, the
Semapa Group, through its subsidiary NSOSPE, acquired the remaining 50% of the share capital of Supremo

Report and Accounts 2015

Cimentos, S.A. Then in July 2015, Semapa sold its stake in NSOSPE to Secil; this company now directly and
indirectly holds 100% of Supremo, which is why the subsidiary is now fully consolidated in the Group.

Subsequent Events

= Between 1 January 2016 and 2 March 2016, Semapa — Sociedade de Investimento e Gestdo, SGPS, S.A.
purchased 374,999 own shares, and now owns 0.466% of its share capital.

10. Outlook

The latest economic projections for 2016 and 2017 continue to point to a downward trend in global economic growth.
The review considers a slower recovery of the emerging and developing economies, but also points to less expected
growth in the USA in the coming two years. The Euro Area, on the other hand, progressed quite positively, and growth
is expected to speed up in 2016. The main risks for global economic growth are still the slowdown in Asian economies
and changes in the growth model of China, the fall in the prices of raw materials, oil in particular, and the
normalisation of US monetary policy by setting quantitative easing aside.

In Portugal, the general economic outlook for 2016 is slightly better than in recent years. The latest projections of the
Bank of Portugal point to a 1.7% growth in economic activity in 2016. The most recent projections of the IMF also hint
at 1.5% growth.

Paper and Pulp

While pulp prices are still at an interesting level, sustaining good demand levels, the drop in prices at the beginning of
2016 suggests a less favourable behaviour for the sector in the coming months. The severe pressure that the prices of
raw materials are still under and the slowdown in economic growth in China lead to much market instability, causing
the fear that growing demand may not follow in the steps of the new pulp capacity that is expected for this year.
Exchange rate developments will remain the core factor of competitiveness between pulp manufacturers.

The tissue paper sector should continue to perform well, specifically in terms of demand, with interesting levels of
growth in consumption in Europe and emerging economies, like China, Turkey and Latin America. However, there is
more competitive pressure, especially among companies which intend to reinforce their production capacity in the
short term.

In the UWF paper market, the prospects are still positive and Portucel has confirmed with its customers in Europe that
the price rose again in February 2016. The impact of the recent reduction in and conversion of capacity of some
productive units in Europe should be visible in 2016, helping towards balancing the market. It is worth noting,
however, that there are a set of factors that could cause some instability in the paper market over the next few
months. On the one hand, the impacts resulting from the anti-dumping case brought by American authorities will
cause changes between supply and demand in various locations, specifically a greater pressure on the supply in
several countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe. The depreciations in exchange rates and the control of foreign
currency in some countries of the Middle East, Africa and Latin America may also create additional difficulties for
international trade.

The anti-dumping measures taken by the US Department of Commerce also affected the Portucel Group, on which a
provisional rate of 29.53% was applied on 20 August 2015. Portucel finds the duty inappropriate, and it highlighted
that the calculation had been partly founded on opposite assumptions to the information that the Department of
Commerce classified as wrong, which was proven by the announcement on 11 January 2016 of the decision of the
Department of Commerce to fix the final anti-dumping rate at 7.8%.

In the scope of this proceeding the final anti-dumping rates applied to the other countries (Australia, Brazil, China and
Indonesia) ranged between 22% and 222%; in the case of China and Indonesia, these anti-dumping rates accrue the
countervailing duties.

While the current rate is well below that of 20 August, Portucel still disagrees entirely with any anti-dumping margin
and it will continue to resort to procedural means to prove that the measure is inappropriate.

Following Portucel Group’s strategic option to diversify its business and enter the tissue business, Portucel intends to
invest in a tissue paper production line and the corresponding transformation into a final product, with a nominal

capacity of 70 thousand tons per year, with an estimated value of around 121 million euros. However, the decision to
invest will depend on several assumptions, including the approval by AICEP of the application to the Portugal 2020
programme under assessment, which will grant funding and/or tax allowances. The Group also applied to the PIN
project, which was awarded by AICEP last January.

The construction project for the pellet factory in the USA continues at a good pace, specifically through the
consolidation of the project team based in Greenwood, South Carolina. The civil construction projects got underway at
the beginning of August 2015. With 90% of the investment amount already awarded, the equipment assembly is well
under way and should be completed by April 2016. The commissioning and test period will begin in May, and the start
up of production is planned for July. During the year, the initial investment amount estimated at 110 million USD was
reviewed upwards to 116.5 million USD, and the plant's nominal production capacity grew from 460,000 tons to
500,000 tons a year.

In Mozambique, after an initial phase centred primarily on trials to select the best genetic material for producing raw
material for paper pulp and energy processing, operations will grow significantly in 2016 as the Group presses ahead
with its new forestry plantations.

Cement

For Portugal, the projections of GDP growth in 2016, the recovery in domestic demand and investment, with a
reversal in the licensing of home construction and an increase in construction productivity, helped to foresee a slight
growth in the construction market and in cement consumption in 2016. The expected recovery in the domestic
market, combined with savings and gains achieved through the streamlining measures implemented in previous years,
offer the prospect of an improvement in results.

In Lebanon, 2016 should not be very different to 2015. The changes which have occurred in the Middle East have not
helped to preserve macroeconomic stability. The cement market is expected to decline in 2016 due to the expected
slowdown in residential construction and lower investor confidence, caused by the lingering uncertain political
situation in the country and region. Continuation of a challenging and competitive environment with impact on sales
prices is expected. However, these negative effects may be partly offset by less energy costs due to lower oil prices.
Block sales should rise in the coming months, as the new plant is receiving more orders and is beginning to build a
customer portfolio.

For Tunisia, the latest IMF figures point to 3% growth of the economy. However, economic growth prospects remain
very uncertain due to recent events and the unstable environment. Competition should continue to be intense and
increased pressure on sales prices is expected (in the domestic and foreign markets).

The outlook for 2016 for Angola is negative. Although the IMF is forecasting growth of 3.5% for the economy in 2016,
the negative impact from the recent variations in the price of oil cannot help but affect the economy over the course
of this year. The difficulties in processing payments abroad, as a result of the foreign-exchange restrictions imposed by
the National Bank of Angola, paint a rather negative image for the construction and public works sector. The year got
off with decreasing diesel and fuel oil prices, together with a new and steep 15% depreciation of the kwanza.
Although the cement market is expected to drop in 2016, increasing costs will impact clinker producers more than
other Group activities.

In Brazil, no improvement in the macroeconomic scenario is expected in 2016, which foretells the continuation of the
difficulties in economic activity and especially in the activities tied to the construction sector, due to the difficulty in
investments coming to fruition. The economy may shrink 3.5%, according to the latest estimates of the IMF (January
2016).

The cement market is expected to drop again, albeit slightly less than in 2015. Public works should not perform better
than in 2015, but there are the elections for the local governments that may bring some dynamics to the sector. On
the other hand, the privatisation programme that was announced is anticipated with some excitement.

Environment

Considering the current macroeconomic, financial and sector environment, slight improvements are envisaged in the
medium term in the sector operated by the ETSA Group. The boosting consumption of foodstuffs (due to effective
increase or simply to changes in the average shopping basket) will result in a slight increase in the animal slaughter
rate, after a period of reinvestment in the main collection centres and especially after the implementation of gradual
import replacement mechanisms which, consequently, although deferred and still uncertain, will allow an increase in
some categories of by-products generated. However, the competition between operators in arranging raw material,
which is scanty, will remain intense, because of the pronounced overcapacity of industrial processing.

The ETSA Group’s prime objectives in the short term include (i) concentrating on the horizontal expansion of its
production and destination markets of its end products (exports accounted for close to 32.8% of total accrued sales in
2015), (ii) identifying fresh opportunities for vertical growth, channelling its investments to improving operational
efficiency, extracting maximum value from the channels operated and retaining the loyalty of the main conventional
and alternative collection centres, (iii) the gradual and progressive recovery of balanced sales margins in the market,
and (iv) focus on sustained innovation and research and development addressed at ensuring new profit thresholds for
the business.

be adjusted, while the amount payable per share will remain unchanged.

2. That the individual distribution of the share in profits be made by the Executive Board in that which relates to the
Employees and by the Remuneration Committee in that which relates to the directors and, since this amount was
already reflected in the financial statements, it shall be transferred to item Free Reserves.
