CEO letter

Building the Future
Relationship Bank

Dear Shareholder

In 2014 Nordea not only delivered
robust results, but also took the next
steps in the transformation to meet
our customers’ changing behaviour
and the new regulatory requirements.

Last year proved to be yet another
challenging year for our societies and
the European economy. Growth
expectations were disappointed, infla-
tion and interest rates turned towards
zero, the oil price tumbled and unfore-
seen geopolitical tensions rose. Mean-
while, the challenges with high debt
levels, budget deficits and weak com-
petitiveness remained unsolved.

I’m pleased that despite this eco-
nomic environment we delivered
improved revenues and lower costs
leading to increased profitability. We
welcomed more new customers and
strengthened our relations with exist-
ing customers, financing their activities
and facilitating growth in our societies.
And we further strengthened our capi-
tal position, safeguarding our position
as a trusted partner and our ability to

Nordea Annual Report 2014

deliver great customer experiences at
any time. Achievements that were also
recognised during the year as we were
awarded best bank in the Nordics by
Euromoney and safest bank in the
Nordics by Global Finance.

More customers and continued
swift transformation

In Retail Banking 90,000 new rela-
tionship customers chose Nordea as
their financial partner. We now have
3.16 million relationship customers,
demonstrating our strong position in
the Nordic retail market.

The swift transformation of our cus-
tomers’ behaviour continues, as they
increasingly use our online services
and interact with us whenever and
wherever they want to. The number of
new mobile banking users increases
by 1,000 each and every day, and dur-
ing 2014 the number of mobile trans-
actions grew by 90%, illustrating the
pace of the changing behaviour.

We continue to expand our digital
banking offerings, be it via mobile or

tablet, our contact centre, Netbank,
remote online meetings or via Face-
book. Among the new offerings
launched last year were new mobile
banking solutions, providing custom-
ers with features like drag and drop
payments and transfers, full overview
of loans and credit cards and secure
e-mail. New convenient digital solu-
tions like instant approval of con-
sumer loans in Private Netbank in
Denmark and an automated mortgage
loan process for our Swedish custom-
ers were also introduced.

To meet the swiftly changing
demands we are inviting our custom-
ers to take part in the development of
new solutions. In the fall we initiated
Nordea Next, where we involve and
engage customers in validating
selected ideas for new digital services.
And in November we and IBM
invited developers to the Nordea
Innovation Challenge competition,
with the winning solution being a
visualisation of the customer's spend-
ing habits.

Consolidated position as

leading wholesale bank

In Wholesale Banking we further
consolidated our position as market
leader serving the largest corporates
and institutions. During the year, the
number of large transactions on the
market increased significantly. Nor-
dea took a leading role in many of
these transactions, providing cus-
tomers with access to attractive
financing.

Several number one positions in
league tables confirmed our strong
capital market franchise, and Whole-
sale Banking was ranked as the leading
bank for large corporates in the Nor-
dics by Greenwich as well as number
one in Nordic Equities by Prospera.

Assets under management

at new record high

Also in Wealth Management we took
a big step in 2014 solidifying our posi-
tion as the largest provider in our
region. A record-high net inflow of
EUR 18.6bn, coming from all client
segments contributed to the increase
in assets under management to an all-
time high of EUR 262bn.

As in Retail Banking also Private
Banking within Wealth Management
attracted more customers reaching a
total of 109,500. Strengthened advi-
sory capabilities and solutions con-
tributed to the all-time high inflow of
assets under management, and in
October, Nordea was awarded best
private bank in the Nordics by the
global financial magazine The Banker,
part of the Financial Times Group.

As an important part of ensuring
sustainable and strong returns to our
customers, we are consistently work-
ing on integrating assessments of envi-
ronmental, social and governance

(ESG) issues into our investment deci-
sions. Recognising our success in this
field, the European magazine Capital
Finance International in 2014 awarded
Nordea for having the best ESG invest-
ment process in Europe.

Delivering on the 2015 plan

Asa result of the continued inflow of
new customers and strengthened
relationships in all business areas,
revenues increased by 2% in local
currencies and excluding non-recur-
ring items. At the same time we have
increased our efficiency and costs
were lowered by 1%. Loan losses
decreased by 6 basis points to 15 basis
points and are now below the 10-year
average. As a consequence the operat-
ing profit was up by 12%, and the
return on equity was 11.6%. Since the
beginning of the financial crisis, Nor-
dea has never delivered a return on
equity below 10.6%.

Our strong capital generation con-
tinued and Nordea is now fully com-
pliant with the Swedish FSA’s capital
requirement.

For 2015 we are planning for another
year of low growth, subdued loan
demand and continued changed cus-
tomer behaviour.

The conclusion of our stress tests in
the credit portfolios is that no signifi-
cant short term deterioration is
expected in credit quality, and we will
continue to increase efficiency, lead-
ing to a 5% cost reduction in local
currencies in 2015 versus 2013 and
strengthened capital efficiency — and
thus deliver on our 2015 plan.

Great customer experiences

in the future

In 2015 we will also continue adapting
to the changing behaviour among our

CEO letter

customers and to the new regulation.

Digitalisation is changing our soci-
eties as consumers go online shop-
ping, use streaming or interact in new
ways that have already transformed a
number of industries. This is a com-
plex and challenging situation, but
digitalisation is first and foremost an
exciting opportunity to deliver great
customer experiences in new ways. To
make everyday services easier and
more convenient to use and to create
more personalised and relevant solu-
tions for each customer, whether a
large international company or a
young household customer.

To facilitate the development of
more convenient customer solutions
and systems that efficiently fulfil the
increasing monitoring and reporting
requirements under the new regula-
tion, we are simplifying processes in
all parts of the bank. As part of this
process, we will increase our IT
investments by 30-35% over the
coming years and build new core
banking and payment platforms,
significantly increasing our agility,
benefits of scale and resilience.

Also in the digital future the highly
committed and skilled employees in
every part of Nordea will make the
difference. With our values and rela-
tionship strategy guiding our work
and our strong financial performance
as foundation, we continue the jour-
ney towards the Future Relationship
Bank — ensuring great customer expe-
riences also in the future.

Best regards

Strategy

- the future

relationship bank developing

Our relationship strategy
and leading market posi-
ions have created and con-
inue to create significant
value for all our stakehold-
ers. This has been achieved
by focusing efforts on cus-
omers’ needs in a cost-
efficient manner, managing
our capital base and main-
ining our low-risk profile
and low earnings volatility.
The needs of customers
and our relationship strat-
egy are also the starting
point for our return on
equity target of 13% at

the required common equity
tier 1 (CET1) ratio, taking
prevailing low interest rates
into account. Nordea aims
at operating with a CET1
capital ratio of approx. 15%,
including a management
buffer.

Nordea Annual Report 2014

Nordea is a universal bank guided by
its established customer-centric and
advisory-led relationship strategy.
The main pillar supporting this strat-
egy is our awareness that our success
and the purpose of our operations
start with meeting the needs of our
customers. Moreover, our long-term
strategic objectives reflect our convic-
tion that we are an integral part of the
societies we serve. Our aim is to be an
enabling, positive force for customers,
society and investors by focusing on
creating a sustainable business model
for all our stakeholders.

Our vision is to be a Great European
bank, acknowledged for its people,
creating superior value for customers
and shareholders. Our vision and stra-
tegic targets are firmly supported by
our culture and values — Great cus-
tomer experiences, It’s all about peo-
ple and One Nordea team.

Our roadmap towards the future is
primarily a result and reflection of the
needs of our customers and the chal-
lenging macroeconomic and regula-
tory environment in which we oper-
ate. Our work begins with the
customer, as we strive to provide
Great customer experiences and holis-
tic financial solutions in a low-risk,
efficient and diversified manner. In
operational terms, we have during the
last four years had a clear focus on
constantly improving our cost and
capital efficiency in order to maintain

a sustainable operating model, secure
competitive offerings and remain a
solid banking institution. By servicing
our customers and fine-tuning our
business system, we are convinced
that we can continue to access funding
at competitive price levels, lend to the
real economy and deliver an attractive
return on equity and top-tier total
shareholder return among European
peers.

In order for our banking model to
evolve going forward, we will con-
tinue to work with our main focus
areas:

¢ Balanced customer focus — Building
on a customer-centric organisa-
tional design, we strive to deliver
the right products in the right man-
ner at the right price. In all of our
business areas, we provide a full
suite of advice-driven products
continuously adapted to the chang-
ing demand and environment. Our
focus is to be close to our custom-
ers’ needs, and thereby be the natu-
ral choice when customers choose
the advisor for their event-driven
transactions — be they corporate or
household related.

People focus — We nurture clear val-
ues and principles, reflected in our
objectives, how we lead, listen to,
develop and support our people.
Our values and leadership are the

The needs of customers and our relationship strategy
are the starting point for our return on equity target of

ratio, taking prevailing low interest rates into account.

strongest drivers of performance and
corporate culture. We believe in put-
ting people first - Nordea can reach
its goals only if its employees reach
theirs.

¢ Value chain optimisation — Our three
business areas’ value chains are
designed to support the focused
relationship strategy. Having one
operating model and business area
ownership of the end-to-end value
chain ensures a comprehensive view,
accountability and congruity. It safe-
guards operational efficiency by
improving the quality of customer
relationships, increasing the time
spent with customers and reducing
the time required to bring new prod-
ucts and services to market.

¢ Simplification — In order to continue
to deliver Great customer experiences
in the face of digitisation, changing
customer behaviour and increased
operational regulations we need to
become more agile and realise the full
potential of our scale while ensuring
continued resilience. To do so, we will
continue to adopt and develop best
practice and strive for transparency
and reduced complexity in our prod-
ucts and processes. In addition, we
have launched a programme and
investments to make the transition to
a New Core Banking Platform, a New
Payment Platform, and a Group
Common Data Warehouse.

¢ Trust and responsibility - Our contin-
ued focus on compliance, and

emphasis on implementing new rules
and regulation quickly, make it possi-
ble for us to capture the benefits of
the compliance driven investments
also in the form of a deeper under-
standing of our customers and risks.

Nordea benefits from the strong com-
bination of leading businesses in the
Nordics, and global capabilities well
on par with international peers within
prioritised product segments. This
enables us to reap the benefits of both
relationship banking and economies
of scale.

Nordea Strategy

Household strategy

Household customers are divided
into four segments, based on their
business with us. For each segment,
a distinct value proposition has been
developed — including contact policy,
service level, pricing and product
solutions. The core philosophy of this
strategy is to provide the best ser-
vice, advice and product solutions to
customers — thus ensuring loyalty,
brand value and increasing business
and income. Prices are transparent
and generally non-negotiable. We
have a broad and competitive prod-
uct range, a highly skilled product
organisation and strong distribution
power. Product development is
geared towards reducing complexity
and developing capital-efficient
products, in order to meet both the
demands of customers and regula-
tory requirements. Our savings

offering is designed to take into
account each customer's wealth, level
of involvement, stage of life and risk
appetite.

We pursue a multichannel distribu-
tion strategy. The aim is to improve cus-
tomer satisfaction while reducing the
cost of service. Customer interaction is
conducted through local branches, con-
tact centres, video meetings, online ser-
vices and the mobile bank — the latter of
which is becoming increasingly impor-
tant. We proactively offer recurring
advisory meetings to all existing and
potential relationship customers, taking
their entire finances, risk/return profiles
and long-term objectives into account
in order to provide a comprehensive
financial solution.

Corporate strategy
Corporate customers are also divided
into four segments, based on their

business potential and the complex-
ity of their banking needs. For each
segment, we have developed a dis-
tinct value proposition — including
contact policy, service level and
product solutions — to provide com-
prehensive offerings and ensure
“house bank” relationships. Rela-
tionship managers take holistic
views of the customers’ situations
and targets, and organise the rela-
tionships accordingly. Our strength
and size as the foremost banking
group in the Nordics enable us to
offer leading solutions to the benefit
of our corporate customers.

Our strategy towards our largest
corporate customers has proven
robust during the ongoing transforma-
tion of our industry. We remain com-
mitted to becoming the leading bank
in the wholesale segment in all our
Nordic markets.

Proposed dividend and dividend
ambition

responding to a payout ratio of 70% of
the net profit after tax excluding the
net effect from the charge for impair-
ment of intangible assets of EUR
344m. The dividend yield calculated

The dividend is denominated in
EUR, Nordea’s accounting currency.
The payment currency depends on
the country in which the shares are
registered. Owners of shares regis-
tered in Sweden can choose between
dividend in SEK or EUR. An official
exchange rate is published. In Den-
mark, dividends are paid in EUR. If
the shareholder does not have a EUR
account the dividend is converted
into local currency. Each custody
institution decides its own conver-
sion rate. In Finland, the dividend is
paid in EUR.

Nordea has one of the largest share-
holder bases of all Nordic companies.
The number of shareholders in
Sweden is approx. 98,000, in Finland
approx. 193,000 and in Denmark
approx. 154,000 — largely unchanged
numbers from last year.

The largest shareholder category is
Finnish institutions (including Sampo

shares at year-end. Swedish institu-
tional shareholders held 24% while
non-Nordic shareholders held 31% of

Our people

Great people create
great customer experience

We can only achieve our
goal of ensuring a great
customer experience if we
employ the right people and
develop them in the right
way. Recruiting, developing,
motivating and retaining the
best people are therefore
among our highest priorities.

Staying value-driven

Our values — Great customer experi-
ences, It’s all about people and One
Nordea team — continue to underpin
our People strategy and drive every-
thing we do. The values are incorpo-
rated in all our processes, training
and leadership, as well as forming the
basis for our leadership capabilities.

Enhancing our leadership

At Nordea, we put relationship first,
striving to create superior value for
every one of our customers and
shareholders. We know that requires
strong leadership — since great leaders
are a prerequisite for great employees.
Leadership is one of the most impor-
tant drivers of culture, performance,
motivation and job satisfaction. How
our leaders perform is key to how our
people perform, which in turn
impacts the quality of our customer's
experience. Our leaders also have an
important role in helping the staff to
live the company values.

When the world changes, leaders
have to change. When leaders are
remote from their direct reports —per-
haps even in another country — it is
even more important that they are
‘present’ in the way they manage.
They need to be very clear about
responsibilities, what tasks need
doing and how people are expected to
perform. Increasingly, leaders will be
held accountable for developing the
talents that report to them and creat-
ing the right team to lead the future
relationship bank.

Managing our talents
Ensuring that our customers have a
positive experience in their dealings
with us is central to everything we do.
It is therefore critical that we employ,
develop and retain the people who are
best placed to help us deliver this goal.
We have identified some of the
most critical competences we think
our employees need to have today
and in the future. These include lead-
ership capabilities, strong execution
and agility and not least the ability to
understand and relate to our custom-
ers. Having identified those compe-
tences, we target our recruitment
activities to the most suitable candi-
dates. While we are the leading Nor-
dic bank, we also hire from outside
the Nordic region to ensure we find
the best people we can.

CSR performance

counts

Nordea is actively committed
to building trust in the finan-
cial industry by increasing

our transparency, improving
engagement with our cus-
tomers and always acting
with integrity.

We want to use our capabilities and
competencies not only to have a
financial impact, but to have a social
impact too. The two go hand in hand.
Conscious of our responsibilities, we
can operate in a way that makes a dif-
ference to the lives of individuals and
to society at large.

Focused on performance

Our commitment starts with taking a
more structured and integrated
approach to sustainability. Over the
past year we have developed group-
wide CSR focus areas at the core of
our business. Approved by our CSR
Committee in November 2014, these
focus areas are the first step in setting
anew CSR ambition level and meas-
uring our CSR performance. These
are being implemented within the
business areas, and coordinated by
the CSR Committee.

CSR as part of our identity

In 2014, the CSR unit, Group Identity
& Communications and Group Mar-
keting were brought together into a
new unit, Group Marketing and
Communications headed by Helena
Andreas, reporting to the CEO. This
structure enables us to make sustain-
ability an integral part of Nordea’s
brand and to fully use our strong
business-driven CSR activities in our
communications. Alongside this, our
new CSR governance model ensures
we are placing these issues at the cen-
tre of what we do by driving decision-
making into our business areas.

Acting with integrity

Through managing risk and operat-
ing with integrity, we build trust and
perform better. Our Operational Risk
and Compliance Awareness Pro-
gramme ensures that our employees
are fully aware of these policies and
commitments. Our whistle-blowing
system, Raise Your Concern, comple-
ments this programme. It encourages
employees to speak up if they have a
serious concern about any misconduct
or irregularities, including any action
that constitutes a violation of laws or
regulations, or of Nordea’s internal
policies, instructions or guidelines. In
2014, three cases were reported and
two are still under investigation.

Understanding our place in soci-
ety

Asa bank, we are a source of finance
and a trusted financial partner, gen-
erating financial value directly for our
customers, suppliers, business part-
ners, employees, shareholders, the
companies in which we invest, and
other investors. We generate social
value through the benefits our prod-
ucts bring to people, through our
community programmes, and by pay-
ing taxes. Moreover, since we are sig-
nificant owners of the companies in
which we invest, we can encourage
those companies to operate more
responsibly, both in our own home
markets and globally.

As we further develop our CSR pro-
gramme in the years ahead, we are
confident we can create a positive
impact through all of our roles in
society and generate more value for
all of our stakeholders.

“We have a responsibility to think
and act in the long term. With clarity,
transparency and commitment, | am
sure we can do more and see Nordea
have a greater positive impact on
society.”

Gunn Weersted,
Head of Wealth Management

Nordea’s CSR Report 2014, available on
www.nordea.com/csr

Our approach to CSR

“We aim to create shareholder
value, great customer experi-
ences and be an attractive
financial employer in the mar-
kets where we operate. And we
strive to do so in a way that
benefits society in the long
term.

“To do this, we need to be clear
about what kind of business we
should and shouldn't do and
transparent about how we have
reached our decisions. That
will mean some difficult discus-
sions but we have a willingness
to work through those to reach
the best outcome. One that is
consistent with our values.

“We will not shy away from
these issues just because they
are challenging. We will accept
this is a complicated area and
deal with it. What we must

remember is that this is not
about being perfect, it is about
striving to become better.”

Gunn Weersted, Head of Wealth
Management, Chairman of the

Banking operates under one common
strategy, operating model and gov-
ernance system across markets. In
each of our markets, our main focus is
to deliver great customer experiences.

Strategy

Retail Banking’s ambition is to create
a leading retail banking operation in
the Nordic region in terms of cus-
tomer experience, profitability and
efficiency. The ambition builds on a
strong commitment to relationship
banking.

The banking sector and particularly
the Retail part is transforming, with
swiftly changing customer behaviour
in the direction of using services and
receiving advice online.

To cater for the changing customer
needs and preferences, we strengthen.
our online offerings. The goal is to
build broad and deep relationships
with our customers also online.
Rather than just providing a customer
with one single product, our ambition
is to create online solutions for those

to make all customer relations profit-
able. The relationship customers
have access to our advisers in order
to cover their banking needs.

Our household and corporate advis-
ers are also proactively contacting
customers with further business
potential.

We witness fast changes in custom-
ers’ way of using the bank these
years. Customers increasingly make
use of our online services and want to
interact when and where they want
to. We thus continuously expand the
opportunities for customers to inter-
act with us as they prefer, whether it
be through mobiles or tablets, calling
our contact centre, using the Netbank,
meeting an adviser in a remote net
meeting, chatting with an adviser or
getting a fast answer to an inquiry via
Facebook etc.

Across channels we had close to
656 million interactions with our cus-
tomers throughout the year. We aim
to get the customer experience right
in each touch point as each of these is
an opportunity to deliver good cus-

tomer experiences and to advise,
serve and sell to our customers.

Nordea’s branch network has been
adjusted in accordance with the
changes in customer behaviour where
our customers conduct significantly
fewer manual transactions. We have
today a more efficient and customer-
focused branch network with propor-
tionally more of our employees focus-
ing on advising customers.

We will continue to support our
customers’ good projects while con-
trolling and optimising scarce
resources, attract new relationship
customers to bank with us while
expanding business with our existing
customers.

Capital management is concentrated

to three areas:

¢ Allocating capital to the most profit-
able business

¢ Capital-optimisation of individual
customer relationships, securing
less capital-intensive solutions

¢ Efficiency in models and internal
processes.

The main drivers for keeping costs
down derive from optimisation of
processes, continued optimisation of
the distribution mix, digitalisation, a
continued reduction of manual cash
handling combined with customers’
increased use of online banking solu-
tions. In addition, manual processes
are being further centralised, auto-
mated and some of them off-shored to
the Nordea Operation centre in
Poland.

Business
development

Weak macroeconomic environment
with interest rates at record-low levels
continued to affect the business.
Investments were subdued, resulting
in weak demand for financing from
corporate customers.

The number of Gold and Premium
household customers amounted to
3.16 million, of whom 90,000 were
new Nordea relationship customers,
and 1.8 million household and corpo-

Nordea Annual Report 2014

rate advisory meetings were held.

The swift transformation of our
customers’ behaviour continues,
as they increasingly use our online
services and interact with us
whenever and wherever they prefer
to. In 2014 the number of mobile
transactions increased by 90%,
illustrating the pace of the changing
behaviour.

Within the corporate business, ini-
tiatives to improve capital efficiency
and ancillary income were success-
fully initiated. Further measures were
taken to focus even more on custom-
ers’ needs and our firm belief is that
we by this customer centric focus, in
combination with our size, can give
the best customer offering.

Result

The depreciation of the SEK and NOK
has had a substantial impact on the
reported financials, especially on vol-
umes.

In local currencies, total income
increased by 4% from the previous
year. The growth came from all major
income lines and was driven by all
countries.

In local currencies, lending volumes
increased by 3% while deposit vol-
umes grew by 1%, despite the low
interest rate environment. Net inter-
est income improved by 3%, driven by
the lending book.

Net fee and commission income
showed a steady growth, driven by
the development in the savings area
as well as payment commissions. Net
result from items at fair value
increased by 9% in local currencies,
partly driven by FX transactions.

Our cost efficiency programme is
progressing as planned. Processes are
optimised and distribution is adjusted
to better reflect changed customer
behaviour as manual transactions
continue to decrease. The number of
FTEs continued to decline and total
expenses were down by 1% in local
currencies.

The risk exposure amount (REA)
decreased during the year following
the weakening of the NOK and SEK

and a continued focus on capital effi-
ciency. RAROCAR increased by 1.6
%-points.

Credit quality

Net loan losses decreased and the loan
loss ratio was 19 basis points (21 basis
points in 2013). This was driven by the
development in Denmark and Sweden.

Banking Denmark

A continued high activity level with
customers paved the way for
increased business volumes, leading
to higher total income despite
decreasing interest rates and weak
GDP development. The high level of
inflow of both new corporate and
household customers was maintained
and the cost efficiency programme
continued to be on track with lower
year-over-year costs and a lower
number of FTEs. Loan losses included
a collective provision related to agri-
culture, but continued down.

Banking Finland

Operating profit increased substan-
tially, driven by improved income and
flat costs. A positive development in
the lending spreads was the main
driver behind the good net interest
income. Net fee and commission
income was higher than in 2013,
mainly as a result of the higher stock
market values. Foreign exchange and.
derivatives in the fourth quarter were
important factors for the high net
result from items at fair value.
Expenses were flat. The number of
FTEs decreased by 6% from Decem-
ber 2013. Net loan losses increased
from 2013, but are still at a relatively
low level, especially considering the
weak macroeconomics.

Banking Norway

The weakening of the NOK, due toa
significant reduction in oil prices, had
a substantial impact on the reported
income and expense development.
Customer activity was however high
in 2014, which was also reflected in the
business volume development with
solid growth in local currencies both
for household and corporate. Cross

Lennart Jacobsen is Head of Retail Banking.
“Throughout 2014 we have attracted many
new relationship customers, boosted the
mobile banking usage and improved capital
efficiency. We have won new customers from
all parts of the countries and across all ages.
The constant inflow of new relationship cus-
tomers substantiates Nordea’s strong posi-

sales activities continued and ancillary
income grew compared to 2013. Capi-
tal efficiency and risk pricing was a
focus area in 2014 as well and, despite
the high volume inflow, REA contin-
ued to decline.

Banking Sweden

In 2014 the improving trend of the
Swedish economy was under pressure
which by year end resulted in the
Riksbank lowering the central bank
rate to 0%. Corporate customers’
demand for financing remained mod-
est while competition for new lending
contracts remained fierce. Household
business volumes however continued
to grow in 2014, supported by an
increasing amount of new customers.

The growth in total income was
driven by net interest income, which
in turn was a result of a favourable
direction of lending spreads espe-
cially on the corporate market. Staff
costs increased, but total expenses
were kept at the same level as 2013.
Lending volumes were down 2%,
whereas the strengthening of the
relationship strategy with a focus on

grow deposit volumes and thereby
improved the deposit/lending ratio.

to provide customers with access to
attractive financing in the capital
markets.

Wholesale Banking focuses on
increasing returns through continu-
ous improvements and strict resource
management. Effective business
selection and a strengthened cus-
tomer service model support income
development and capital allocation.

Strategy

The business area has since 2011
undergone a large transformation
developing and advancing the organi-
sational platform. These endeavours
have resulted in the strongest whole-
sale bank in the Nordics with number
one rankings and leading positions
across product offerings.

Wholesale Banking advocates a solu-
tion-oriented approach with a cus-
tomer-centric and return-driven cul-
ture focused on value creation. Central
to this is our strong culture of business
selection and discipline, at both cus-
tomer and transaction level when allo-
cating resources, and monitoring and
managing customer profitability.

A Nordic operating model is
deployed throughout Wholesale
Banking to leverage our core capabili-
ties and scale. These core capabilities
have in turn been strengthened
through focused recruitment and
emphasis on talent management.
Essential to this is to drive the success
of customers, people and business in
alignment with our values.

Core for the relationship strategy is
a close interaction of units across
Wholesale Banking. This is strength-
ened via our integrated financing and
capital markets platform. From

The disintermediation of banks in
the loan market affecting the lending
volume and re-pricing opportunities
was evident through the year. This
was largely offset by strong capital

position as preferred corporate advi-
sor leading to key roles in numerous
major value-adding transactions.

Wholesale Banking’s successful
relationship strategy was recognised
externally with a flourish of top ranks
and awards. Among other, Nordea
was awarded Best Bank, Best Invest-
ment Bank and Best Trade Finance
Bank 2014 in the Nordics by Global
Finance, and was for the fifth consec-
utive year given the StarMine Award.
Positions as number one in league
tables confirmed our strong capital
market franchise throughout the year.

Banking

Corporate customer activity was
modest whereas the event-driven
activities improved with a number of
large transactions. Daily business was
relatively stable with no larger fluctu-
ations in margins and transaction
flows at normal levels during the
year.

Institutional customer activity was
challenged by the macroeconomic
environment with low interest rates
and low volatility leading to a subdued
sentiment for risk management prod-
ucts.

Customer activity in Shipping, Off-
shore & Oil Services was moderate for
the year with improved business
activity in the tanker segment. Off-
shore & Oil Services experienced
weaker market conditions mainly as a
result of reduced oil prices and
increased uncertainty related to
future exploration and production
spending in the oil industry.

In Russia, customer activity was at
a satisfactory level, despite the RUB
volatility and the geopolitical turmoil,
causing a slowdown in the economy
and low capital investments. Monitor-
ing of the development continued and
Nordea is well prepared in case of
further escalation.

Capital markets

FICC delivered a strong result despite
2014 being characterised by low inter-
est rates, low volatility, low risk pre-
miums and compressed margins.

A decline in topline seemed to bottom
out during the summer as customer
activity generally picked up in the
second half of the year, especially
within asset products. Hedging activ-
ity also increased during the same
period as volatility picked up slightly.
Throughout the year, FX volumes
were strong partly offsetting the com-
pressed margins.

The primary bond issuance
improved. Particularly the high yield
sector benefitted from investors’
search for yield further strengthening
the Nordic fixed income market.
Strong corporate balance sheets, liq-
uid financing markets and the low
interest rates fuelled M&A activity in
the Nordic region in 2014 making it
the most active year since 2007. The
ECM market overall was down
slightly from 2013, but high asset
prices made it the largest IPO market
in years.

Equities business improved during
2014, with both secondary and pri-
mary equity contributing positively
throughout the year, proving a strong
result in all aspects of the business.
The Nordic efforts were strongly
backed by the UK client franchise
established in the beginning of the
year targeted towards the interna-
tional clientele. By all measures Nor-
dea strengthened its position as the
best Nordic equity house as most
recently evidenced by the Nordic
Prospera 2014 review.

Credit quality

Net loan losses amounted to EUR
98m. The loan loss ratio was 10 basis

Nordea Annual Report 2014

points (26 basis points in 2013). In
Shipping, Offshore & Oil Services,
net reversals were reported of EUR
37m compared to net loan losses of
EUR 95m in 2013. The loan loss ratio
in Corporate & Institutional Banking
was 32 basis points (45 basis points in
2013) and in Banking Russia 24 basis
points (net reversals in 2013).

Result

Total income was EUR 2,449m, a
decrease of 3% in local currencies
from the previous year (-6% in EUR).
The shift in income composition from
items at fair value to fee and commis-
sion income was underlined by the
year-over-year development.

Total expenses decreased by 2% in
local currencies from the previous
year (-6% in EUR). Continued strict
resource management resulted in
lower REA and a competitive cost/
income ratio, up somewhat compared
to the previous year.

Operating profit increased to EUR
1,506m, up 6% in local currencies
from last year (+3% in EUR). The
business area RAROCAR amounted
to 14%.

Corporate & Institutional Banking
Total income was down by 1% com-
pared to last year, although fee and
commission income increased by 7%.
2014 was characterised by intense
competition, both from international
and Nordic competitors affecting the
market pricing. Daily business was
moderate with stable transaction
flows. Event-driven transaction level
was strong during the year, with
some local differences. The low vola-
tility in capital markets and stable low
interest rates challenged the business
mainly in the first half of the year of
2014 affecting the demand for hedg-
ing products.

Institutional customer activity was
modest with a few large deals closed
in the first and latter part of the year
and a strong Equity activity. The
income result was overall impacted
by low income in the risk manage-
ment activities.

Shipping, Offshore & Oil Services
Total income was up 5% compared to
last year, mainly due to an increase in
commission income on lending. Busi-
ness activity was somewhat higher
than in 2013, with stable lending vol-
umes and the overall customer activ-
ity remained at a moderate level. The
dry cargo and container markets were
generally weak during the year. Loan
volumes at the end of the year were
EUR 11.6bn, 2% up from year-end
2013. Net reversals were reported of
EUR 37m, compared to net loan losses
of EUR 95m in the previous year,
reflecting an improvement in credit
quality.

Banking Russia

Total income increased 7% from the
previous year to EUR 274m due to
strong net interest income throughout
the year. Average lending volumes
decreased 8% in local currencies in
2014 compared to 2013, and were down
by 7% in local currencies in the corpo-
rate portfolio (+2% in EUR mainly due
to the appreciation of the USD, which
makes up ~70% of the lending portfo-
lio). Expenses were decreased by 11%
in EUR, primarily due to the deprecia-
tion of RUB. Operating profit remained
strong, up 4% in EUR from last year.
This includes moderate provisions for
future loan losses of EUR 15m com-
pared to reversals in 2013.

Wholesale Banking other
(including Capital Markets unallo-
cated)

Wholesale Banking other total
income was down 39% from the pre-
vious year, reflecting continuous low
interest rates and subdued market
activity. Wholesale Banking other is
the residual result not allocated to
customer units. This includes the
unallocated income from Capital
Markets, Transaction Products and
International Units. It also includes
the additional liquidity premium for
the funding cost of long-term lending
and deposits in Wholesale Banking.
Optimisation of the business takes
place in the relevant customer and
product units.

Wealth Management provides high
quality investment, savings and risk
management products. It manages
customers’ assets and gives financial
advice to affluent and high net worth
individuals as well as institutional
investors.

The area consists of the businesses:
Private Banking serving customers
from 80 branches in the Nordics as
well as from offices in Luxembourg,
Zurich and Singapore; Asset Manage-
ment responsible for actively managed
investment funds and mandates and
for serving institutional asset manage-
ment customers; Life & Pensions serv-
ing customers with a full range of pen-
sion, endowment and risk products.
Additionally, the area consists of the
service units Savings & Wealth Offer-
ings and Strategy, Support & Control.

Wealth Management is the largest
Nordic private bank, life & pensions
provider and asset manager. Wealth
Management has approximately 3,500
employees, approximately 500 of
whom are employed outside the Nor-
dic region, primarily in Europe.

Strategy

It is our vision to become the leading
Wealth Manager in each Nordic mar-
ket, with global reach and global
capabilities. To reach this position we
are continuously ensuring that our
business model provides our custom-
ers with high-quality advice, a high

standard of service and a broad and
deep offering of high-quality prod-

ucts through a cost and capital-effi-
cient value chain. Throughout 2014

Wealth Management has continued
the work focusing on the three stra-
tegic priorities, communicated and

presented at Nordea’s Capital Mar-

kets Day in 2013:

¢ Enhance Value Propositions
* Capitalise Growth Momentum
¢ Efficiency & Prioritisation

To enhance our value propositions,
we have introduced a state of the art
financial planning tool for advisory
sessions in Retail and Private Bank-
ing. Additionally we have strength-
ened our online and mobile savings
value proposition for retail customers.

To capitalise on growth momen-
tum, and grow at low costs, we have
increased the share of highly cost-
efficient and profitable bancassurance
in Retail Banking through realloca-
tion of resources to enable low-cost
profitable growth in existing busi-
ness. We have continued to focus on
attracting more profitable institu-
tional volumes and to attract clients
with higher assets in Private Banking.

As part of our continued focused
prioritisation, we have divested our
Life portfolio in Luxembourg and in
the Isle of Man.

of Nordea funds, primarily covering
non-Nordic customers, demonstrates
well the progress towards our vision
to have global reach and global capa-
bilities. Global Fund Distribution has
throughout 2014 achieved record-high
net flows of EUR 4.8bn demonstrating
the high quality of our offerings.

Business
development

Nordea’s Assets under Management
(AuM) increased to EUR 262.2bn, up
EUR 30.1bn or 13% from 2013. The
increase in AuM was due to net flow
of EUR 18.6bn and market apprecia-
tion of EUR 11.5bn. 2014 ended with
AuM at another all-time high.

All businesses contributed posi-
tively to the net flow.

Customers’ interest in investing in
discretionary management solutions
continued to increase in 2014. In the
prevailing low interest rate environ-
ment, it is difficult to achieve a satis-
factory investment return without
taking too much risk. The discretion-
ary solutions allow customers to ben-
efit from Nordea’s investment process
in which risk levels are closely man-
aged to match future possible returns
with client expectations and risk pro-
files.

The number of Private Banking
customers increased to 109,500 by the
end of 2014. A continued strong focus
is held on customer acquisition as
well as aligning the Private Banking
service and advisory model with the
needs of the customers and the regu-
latory changes in the market.

As a step towards further improving

Nordea Annual Report 2014

customer satisfaction, Private Banking
has during 2014 taken a focused
approach to take the quality of cus-
tomer meetings to the next level. Net
inflow in Private Banking amounted to
EUR 3.9bn, mainly due to flow from
newly acquired customers.

In 2014, Nordea Private Banking was
recognised for this continued work,
when Nordea was awarded “Best Pri-
vate Bank in the Nordics” by the global
financial magazine The Banker, part of
the Financial Times Group.

Throughout 2014, Asset Manage-
ment has maintained its strong
momentum in sales and revenues in all
client segments. Net flows into the
Nordic retail funds across all four Nor-
dic countries were EUR 4.9bn in 2014.

Net flow from Institutional Clients
and Global Fund Distribution was
EUR 2.9bn and EUR 4.8bn respec-
tively. The institutional segment had
positive net flows with especially
high value of the flow in Germany
and Norway and the strong develop-
ment in value of AuM continued.
Global Fund Distribution too contin-
ued the strong growth, and achieved
record-high net flows of EUR 4.8bn
in 2014. The net flow was well diver-
sified in terms of products with
Multi-Asset solutions continuing to
attracting the highest net flows. The
growth remained strong across all
countries of distribution during 2014,
with a noticeable strong development
in continental Europe.

During 2014 Nordea has drawn
benefits from new EU legislations
that enable a fund company to man-
age and market funds across borders
and merged Nordea’s four Nordic
fund companies into one Nordic fund

company, domiciled in Finland with
branches in Sweden, Norway and
Denmark.

Investment performance was satis-
factory in 2014 with 62% of compos-
ites outperforming benchmarks. The
3-year performance is strong with
72% of all composites outperforming
benchmarks.

Life & Pensions’ gross written pre-
miums continued to exceed the
record levels reported in 2013, reach-
ing EUR 7,601m in 2014 which is 14%
higher than 2013.

The market return product driven
sales momentum in the Nordea Bank
channel continued to fuel new busi-
ness sales. The Nordea distribution
network continued to generate two-
thirds of total sales during 2014. Mar-
ket return products continued to sup-
port the growth in AuM and
amounted at the end of the year to
52% of total AuM in Life & Pensions.

Result

Total income was EUR 1,693m in 2014,
up 11% from last year. The increase
from 2013 is mainly due to double
digit increase in income in Life & Pen-
sions and Asset Management.

Costs have decreased 2% compared
to the previous year as a consequence
of successful cost management. Due
to increased income and lower costs,
operating profit was EUR 903m, up
24% from 2013.

Private Banking

Total income was EUR 542m in 2014, a
3% increase compared to 2013, and
the strongest year yet for the Private
Banking business. The increased
income level was supported by higher

Legal structure
Nordea aims at continuous simplification of its legal struc-
ture and as regards the Nordic banks the aim is that Nordea
Bank AB (publ) will be converted into a European company.
Among other things, a conversion is conditional on Nordea
obtaining necessary approvals from the relevant authorities.
The final regulatory responses to the financial crisis are
yet to be fully seen, and to be evaluated. Nordea is follow-
ing up and analysing the changes in process, which are not
expected to be finalised during 2015.

Macroeconomic development

2014 was another year of low growth and low interest rates
as these declined further, even reaching negative levels in
some areas. The global scene was characterised by mixed
developments in economic data and by increased geopolit-
ical tensions. The US and UK economies showed continued
strong signs with strong GDP growth and US unemploy-
ment falling below 6%. In Europe, the improvements were
more modest with still low GDP growth.

The Nordic economies showed some growth, and the
overall picture still appeared relatively robust. In Sweden
and Norway, GDP growth continued to hold up relatively
well. Economic growth in Norway is however expected to
slow down. The growth in Denmark has remained at
lower level, but showed signs of improvement. In Finland,
growth was subdued and followed the more mixed picture
seen in the Euro area. Unemployment has been largely
unchanged in the region.

Result summary for 2014

EUR 344m) and are in line with the cost-efficiency pro-
gramme. Net loan losses decreased from last year to a level
of 15 basis points of loans. Operating profit was up 12% in
local currencies excluding non-recurring items (+9% in
EUR).

The result comments relate to the continuing operations,
excluding the Polish operations which, in the reporting,
are separated as discontinued operations.

Income

Net interest income increased 2% in local currencies com-
pared to 2013 (1% in EUR). Lending volumes increased
4% in local currencies excluding reverse repurchase agree-
ments. Corporate and household lending margins were
higher, while deposit margins overall were down from one
year ago. Net interest margin, the average net interest
income on lending and deposits, was 1.08%, largely
unchanged from last year (1.07%).

Net fee and commission income increased 10% in local
currencies (+8% in EUR), mainly due to strong commission
income from savings and investments as well as higher
lending commissions.

Net result from items at fair value decreased by 6% in
local currencies (-7% in EUR) compared to last year, fol-
lowing lower customer activity.

Income under the equity method was EUR 18m (EUR
79m) and other income was EUR 79m (EUR 106m) exclud-
ing the gain from the divestment of the shareholding in
Nets Holding of EUR 378m.

Expenses

Total expenses were down 1% in local currencies (-4% in EUR)
compared to 2013 excluding impairment charge and restruc-
turing costs. Staff costs were up 3% in local currencies exclud-
ing restructuring costs (largely unchanged in EUR). Other
expenses were down 8% in local currencies excluding restruc-
turing costs (-11% in EUR). Restructuring cost related to the
cost efficiency programme amounted to EUR 190m (see also
Note G7). Depreciations were EUR 582m including a charge
for impairment of intangible assets of EUR 344m, following the
decision to replace some of the current IT systems.

Net loan losses

Net loan loss provisions decreased 26% in local currencies
to EUR 534m (-27% in EUR), corresponding to a loan loss
ratio of 15 basis points (21 basis points last year). The loan
loss ratio was somewhat below the average loan loss ratio.

Taxes

The effective tax rate in 2014 was 22.0% (including the
bank tax in Finland of EUR 60m), compared to 24.5% last
year. The 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the non-
taxable gain from the divestment of the shareholding in
Nets Holding A/S of EUR 378m.

Net profit and Return on equity (ROE)
Net profit increased 9% in local currencies (+7% in EUR) to
EUR 3,332m, due to somewhat higher income and lower
expenses and net loan losses compared to last year.

Return on equity (ROE) was 11.6% excluding non-recur-

ring items and 11.5% including these (last year 11.0%).

Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV)
The MCEV increased 1.2% to EUR 4,758m (EUR 4,700m).
The value of new business was EUR 248m.

Financial structure

Total assets increased by 6% or EUR 39bn to EUR 669bn in
2014. Total liabilities increased by 6% or EUR 38bn to EUR
640bn. All balance sheet items in foreign currencies are
translated to EUR at the year-end rates when consolidated
into the Nordea Group. See Note G1 for more information
on accounting policies and section 27 therein for cross-cur-
rency rates used.

The euro strengthened against the Swedish and Norwe-
gian krona and against the Russian Rubel in 2014. It was
largely unchanged against the Danish krona. The effect of
changes in currency exchange rates amounted to a total
decrease in the Group’s assets of EUR 13bn. Liabilities
decreased by EUR 12bn.

Loans
The total lending increased EUR 2bn or 1% compared with
previous year.

Securities
Investments in interest-bearing securities and shares
increased by EUR 6bn (5%) compared with previous year.

Deposits and funding activities

Deposits and borrowings decreased by EUR 6bn or 2% to
EUR 254bn, while debt securities in issue increased by
EUR 9bn or 5%. Total debt securities in issue as per the end
of 2014 amounted to EUR 194bn. In 2014, long-term issu-
ance under Nordea funding programmes amounted to
EUR 22bn, excluding Danish covered bonds (EUR 23bn).

Life insurance activities

Net premiums received in the Life business are invested in
interest-bearing securities, shares and properties.
Increases of fair values on these investments as well as
higher premiums written led to an increase in “liabilities
to policyholders” of EUR 5bn or 10%.

Derivatives

The balance sheet items “Derivatives” reflect the net pre-
sent value of derivative contracts split on positive and neg-
ative fair values. Positive market values of derivatives
increased from EUR 71bn to EUR 105bn and negative mar-
kets values increased from EUR 66bn to EUR 97bn. The
reason for this was steep decreases in the long-term inter-
est rates during 2014. The derivatives volume, in nominal
terms, was largely unchanged. For more information, see
Notes G1 and G17.

Financial target

Nordea has return on equity (ROE) target of 13% at the
required common equity tier 1 (CET) capital ratio, taking
prevailing low interest rates into account.

Capital position and capital policy
The Group’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio,

Board of Directors’ report

excluding Basel I floor, increased to 15.7% at the end of
2014, a strengthening of 1.8%-points from the estimated
Basel III ratio at the end of last year. The total capital ratio
excluding Basel I floor increased to 20.7%. Improved capi-
tal ratios were achieved by strong profit generation and a
decrease in risk exposure amounts (REA). In September
2014, Nordea issued a CRDIV-compliant Additional Tier 1
instrument, which strengthened the Tier 1 ratio by 75 basis
points.

The current capital policy states that Nordea Group
should have a target minimum of 13% in CET1 and 17% in
total capital ratio. The most recent review, performed in
the fourth quarter of 2014 leaves the capital targets
unchanged as there are still uncertainties with respect to
the Swedish FSA’s view on standardised models to be used
by the banks for calculating the size of the pillar II add-on,
as well as other ongoing regulatory uncertainties such as
the replacement of the current capital floor. The capital
policy will be revised once the regulatory regime is further
clarified. However, Nordea’s current view is that the bank
should operate with a CET1 ratio of approximately 15%,
including a management buffer, although there is still
some regulatory uncertainty.

Nordea’s dividend ambition is to increase the dividend
payout ratio in 2014 and 2015, while maintaining a strong
capital base.

A description of the Capital position is presented under
Capital management on page 45 and in Note G38.

Credit portfolio

Loans to the public excluding reverse repurchase agree-
ments increased by 4% in local currencies to EUR 304bn
(unchanged in EUR). The share of lending to corporate cus-
tomers was 54%. Lending to shipping, offshore and oil ser-
vices constituted 2.9% of the Group’s total lending and lend-
ing to companies owned by private equity funds was less
than 3% of total lending, of which 99% are senior loans.

The overall credit quality is solid with strongly rated
customers and a positive effect from rating migration on
total in the portfolio. The total effect of improved credit
quality on REA was a decrease of approx. 0.7% in 2014.

Impaired loans gross in the Group were down to EUR
6,425m at the end of the year compared to last year (EUR
6,564m). 64% of impaired loans gross are performing and
36% are non-performing.

Further information about the credit portfolio is
presented under Risk management on page 36, in Note
G47 and in the Capital and Risk Management Report 2014
published on the web pages.

Divestment of the Polish banking, life and financing
businesses completed
The sale of Nordea Bank Polska S.A. was completed on 1
April 2014, following that the Polish Financial Supervision
Authority (PFSA) on 3 March 2014 issued a decision stating
that there were no grounds for objections to the acquisition
as announced on 12 June 2013 by PKO Bank Polski S.A. of
the shares of Nordea Bank Polska S.A., which satisfied the
last condition precedent for the closing of the transaction.

Nordea issued approx. EUR 22bn of long-term debt during
the year, excluding Danish covered bonds.

Liquidity management is presented on page 43. A matu-
rity analysis is presented in Note G45.

Market risk
A description of Market risk is presented on pages 41-42.

Hedge accounting

Nordea uses hedge accounting in order to have a symmet-
rical accounting treatment of the changes in fair value of
the hedged risks in the hedged items and of the hedging
instruments and in order to hedge the exposure to varia-
bility in cash flows and net investments in foreign opera-
tions. More information on the hedged risks is presented
in Note G1.

The Nordea share

According to the Articles of Association, shares in Nordea
may be issued in two classes, ordinary shares and
C-shares. The total number of shares in the Company is
4,049,951,919. All shares are ordinary shares, see also State-
ment of changes in equity on page 64 and a table showing
the change in share capital is found on page 15. The voting
rights are described on page 49. C-shares are not entitled
to any dividend.

In addition, there are provisions in the Articles of Asso-
ciation which will ensure that the reciprocal rights and
obligations between each owner and each class remain in
case of any issuance of new shares, warrants or converti-
bles. There are no restrictions in law or in the Articles of
Association regarding the right to transfer shares and the
Company is not aware of any agreements between share-
holders in this respect.

However, since Nordea is a credit institution, a direct or
indirect acquisition of shares in Nordea, which causes the
acquirer's total holding to comprise a qualified holding (rep-
resents 10% or more of the equity capital or of the voting
capital) or an increase of qualified holdings, may only take
place following consent by the Swedish Financial Supervi-
sory Authority according to the Swedish Banking and
Financing Business Act.

On 31 December 2014, Sampo ple was the largest individ-
ual shareholder with a holding of 21.4% and the only share-
holder with a holding of more than 10%. A table showing
the largest registered shareholders in Nordea end of 2014 is
found on page 14.

On 31 December 2014, the employees had an indirect
shareholding of 0.5% in the Company through the Nordea
Profit-sharing Foundation and a minor indirect sharehold-

Nordea Annual Report 2014

ing in the Company through the pension foundation. The
voting rights are in neither case exercised directly by the
employees.

Holding of own shares

As of 31 December 2014, Nordea held 23,009,458 shares
(0.6% of total number of shares) in Nordea, a decrease of
8,778,474 shares compared to 31 December 2013. The quota
value is EUR 1 and the acquisition price amounts to EUR
83m. These shares are partly held for trading purposes and
partly as hedges of conditional rights in the Long Term
Incentive Programmes.

Dividend
The Board of Directors proposes to the AGM a dividend of
EUR 0.62 per share (EUR 0.43) and further, that the record
date for dividend should be 23 March 2015. The dividend
corresponds to a payout ratio of 70% of net profit excluding
the net effect from the charge for impairment of intangible
assets of EUR 344m. Total proposed dividend amounts to
EUR 2,501m.

The ex-dividend date for the Nordea share is 20 March
2015. The dividend payments are scheduled to be made on
30 March 2015.

Mandate to acquire and convey own shares

The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM 2015 should
authorise the Board of Directors to decide on acquisition of
own shares on a regulated market where the company’s
shares are listed, or by means of an acquisition offer
directed to all shareholders. The authorisation is limited so
that Nordea’s holdings of own shares may not exceed 10%
of all shares.

The purpose of acquisition of own shares is to facilitate an
adjustment of the company’s capital structure to prevailing
capital requirements and to facilitate the use of own shares
as payment for or financing of acquisitions of companies and
businesses.

The Board further proposes an authorisation to decide on
conveyance of own shares, to be used as payment for or
financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses. Con-
veyance may be made in another way than on a regulated
market and with deviation from shareholders’ pre-emptive
rights.

The AGM 2014 decided on corresponding authorisations
to acquire and convey own shares.

Mandate to issue convertible instruments

The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM 2015
should authorise the Board of Directors to decide on issu-
ing of convertible instruments, with or without preferen-
tial rights for existing shareholders. The authorisation
means that the share capital may be increased by maxi-
mum 10% of the Company’s share capital. The authorisa-
tion may be used on one or several occasions up until the
next AGM.

An issue of convertible instruments should be done on
market conditions. The purpose of the authorisation is to
facilitate a flexible and efficient adjustment of the Compa-
ny’s capital structure to the capital requirements.

The AGM 2014 decided on a corresponding authorisation
to decide to issue convertible instruments.

Rating
Ratings of the Nordea Group are presented on page 215.

Personnel

Personnel expenses, significant agreements with key man-
agement personnel and the distribution by number of
employees by country and gender are disclosed in Note
G7. More information is presented on the page about Our
people on page 16.

Profit sharing and share-based incentive systems
For 2014, a total of approx. EUR 92m was expensed under
Nordea’s ordinary profit-sharing scheme for all employees
and the Long-Term Incentive Programmes for managers
and key employees (EUR 62m last year).

For 2014, each employee could receive a maximum of
EUR 3,200, of which EUR 2,600 was based on RAROCAR
and EUR 600 on the level of customer satisfaction.

The Profit Sharing scheme and the share-based incen-
tive systems as well as other remuneration principles are
presented in the chapter Remuneration on page 55-58 and
in Note G7.

Pension liabilities

The total pension obligation in defined benefit plans has
increased from EUR 3,130m to EUR 3,727m in 2014. The
increase is mainly due to re-measurements from changes in
financial assumptions, mainly the discount rates, slightly
offset by translation differences. Pensions paid have had a
decreasing effect offset by new pension rights earned and
discounting effects. The fair value of plan assets is EUR
3,229m, fairly unchanged from 2013 (EUR 3,117m). Return
on plan assets has had an increasing effect, offset by pen-
sion payments and translation differences. The net pension
liability amounts to EUR 498m. See Note G32 for more
information.

Legal proceedings
Within the framework of normal business operations, the
Group faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and dis-
putes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts.
Presently, none of the current disputes are considered
likely to have any significant adverse effect on the Group
or its financial position.

Further information is presented in Note G36.

Impact on the financial statements and regulatory
capital from the assets quality review as of 31
December 2013

An Asset Quality Review (AQR) and stress test for banks
within the euro area has been performed by the European
Central Bank (ECB) and includes the assessment of the
Nordea Bank Finland Group. The results confirm Nordea
Bank Finland’s strong position with a CET1 capital ratio of
10.4% at the end of the stress test horizon. The main find-
ings in the AQR relate to:

¢ Individual loan loss provisions — Negative AQR adjust-
ment EUR 164m (EUR 231m including projection of find-
ings)

¢ Collective loan loss provisions — Negative AQR adjust-
ment EUR 122m

¢ Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA) — Negative AQR
adjustment EUR 62m (EUR 75m including Nordea Group
internal transactions)

After tax and Nordea Group internal risk protection the
AQR impact on available capital in the Nordea Bank Fin-
land Group was negative by EUR 213m, which translated
to a 40 basis points negative impact on the CET1 ratio.

Board of Directors’ report

Although the AQR shall be considered to be a prudential
exercise, an internal assessment has been made on
whether any of the findings should impact the financial
statements 2014. Following this assessment Nordea has to
a certain extent adjusted individual and collective loan loss
provisions in the financial statements in line with the ordi-
nary credit process, but not as a direct consequence of the
findings in the AQR. No adjustment in the financial state-
ments has been made following the AQR findings on CVA,
although the prudent valuation adjustment has been
increased in the capital adequacy reporting.

Environmental concerns and corporate social
responsibility

Nordea is committed to sustainable business and develop-
ment by combining financial performance with environ-
mental and social responsibility as well as sound govern-
ance practices. Nordea has adopted a Nordea
Sustainability policy that spells out the Group's values and
commitments to ethical business. The policy is based on
the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, the UN Dec-
laration of Human Rights, ILO-conventions and the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The Sustainabil-
ity Policy has a specific section on environmental issues
providing guidance on how the Group is to manage and
control environmental issues in its business activities and
its own operations. All employees of Nordea Group,
including non-permanent staff working on behalf of Nor-
dea, are subject to this policy.

Nordea policies are supported by a number of specific and
concrete policies to ensure compliance with the principles in
everyday business. Examples are the human resources poli-
cies, the anti-corruption policies and investment and credit
policies.

Further information is presented under Corporate Social
Responsibility on page 17 and in Nordea’s CSR Report avail-
able on the web pages.

Foreign branches

The parent company has foreign branches in Norway,
Finland, Denmark, the Baltic countries, Poland and China.
On 1 January 2015, the branches in the United Kingdom
and Germany were transferred from Nordea Bank Finland
to the parent company.

Annual General Meeting 2015

The AGM will be held on Thursday 19 March 2015 in
Stockholm. Further information is presented on the last
page of the Annual Report.

Risk, Liquidity and

Board of Directors’ report

Capital management

Management of risk, liquidity and capital
is a key success factor in the financial
services industry.

Maintaining risk awareness in the organisation is
ingrained in the business strategies. Nordea has defined
clear risk, liquidity and capital management frameworks,
including policies and instructions for different risk types,
capital adequacy and capital structure.

Management principles and control

Board of Directors and Board Risk Committee

The Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for
limiting and monitoring the Group’s risk exposure as well
as for setting the targets for the capital ratios. Risk is meas-
ured and reported according to common principles and
policies approved by the Board of Directors, which also
decides on policies for credit risk, counterparty credit risk,
market risk, liquidity risk, business risk life insurance risk
and operational risk management as well as the ICAAP. All
policies are reviewed at least annually.

The Board of Directors approves the credit instructions
where powers-to-act for all credit committees in the organ-
isation are stated. These authorisations vary for different
decision-making levels, mainly in terms of the size of lim-
its but also depending on the internal risk categorisation of
customers. The Board of Directors furthermore decides on
the limits for market and liquidity risk in the Group.

The Board Risk Committee assists the Board of Directors
in fulfilling its responsibilities in terms of overseeing man-
agement and control of risk, risk frameworks as well as
controls and processes associated with the Group’s opera-
tions.

Responsibility of CEO and GEM

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has the overall respon-
sibility for developing and maintaining effective risk,
liquidity and capital management principles and control of
the Bank and the Group.

The CEO in Group Executive Management (GEM)
decides on the Group’s earnings volatility measurement
framework(s) and targets for these, such as the Structural
Interest Income Risk (SIR).

The CEO and GEM regularly review reports on risk
exposure and have established a number of committees for
risk, liquidity and capital management.

¢ The Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), chaired by the
Chief Financial Officer (CFO), prepares issues of major
importance concerning the Group’s financial operations and
balance sheet risks as well as capital management either for
decision by the CEO in GEM or for recommendation by the
CEO in GEM and for decision by the Group Board.

¢ The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer
(CRO), oversees the management and control of the

Group’s risks at an aggregate level and evaluates the suf-
ficiency of the risk frameworks, controls and processes
associated with these risks. Furthermore, the Risk Com-
mittee decides, within the scope of resolutions adopted
by the Board of Directors, on the allocation of the market
risk limits as well as the liquidity risk limits to the risk
taking units. The limits are set in accordance with the
business strategies and are reviewed at least annually.
The heads of the units allocates the respective limits
within the unit and may introduce more detailed limits
and other risk-mitigating techniques such as stop-loss
tules. The Risk Committee has established sub-commit-
tees for its work and decision-making within specific risk
areas.

¢ The Group Executive Management Credit Committee
(GEM CC) and Executive Credit Committee (ECC) are
chaired by the CRO, while the Group Credit Committee
Retail Banking (GCCR) and the Group Credit Committee
Wholesale Banking (GCCW) are chaired by the Chief
Credit Officer (CCO). These credit committees decide on
major credit risk customer limits. Credit risk limits are
granted as individual limits for customers or consoli-
dated customer groups and as industry limits for certain
defined industries.

Responsibility of Group Risk Management and Group
Corporate Centre

Within the Group, two units, Group Risk Management
and Group Corporate Centre, are responsible for risk,
capital, liquidity and balance sheet management. Group
Risk Management, headed by the CRO, is responsible
for the risk management framework and processes.
Group Corporate Centre, headed by the CFO, is respon-
sible for the capital policy, the composition of the capital
base, the capital adequacy framework and for liquidity
risk management. Each business area and group func-
tion is primarily responsible for managing the risks in
its operations within the decided limits and framework,
including identification, control and reporting.

Risk appetite
Risk appetite within Nordea is defined as the level and
nature of risk that the bank is willing to take in order to
pursue the articulated strategy on behalf of shareholders,
and is defined by constraints reflecting the views of share-
holders, debt holders, regulators and other stakeholders.
The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the
Group's overall risk appetite and for setting principles
regarding how risk appetite is managed. The Board Risk
Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling these
responsibilities by reviewing the development of the risk
profile in relation to risk appetite and making recommen-
dations regarding changes to the Group’s risk appetite.
Nordea’s risk appetite framework is based on explicit
top-down risk appetite statements ensuring the compre-
hensive coverage of key risks faced by the Group. These

Nordea Annual Report 2014

statements collectively define the boundaries for Nordea’s
risk-taking activities and will also help identify areas with
scope for additional risk-taking. The statements are
approved by the Board of Directors, and set the basis for a
new risk reporting structure. Moreover, the framework
supports management decision processes such as planning
and target setting.

The Risk Appetite framework considers key risks rele-
vant to Nordea’s business activities and is at an aggregate
level represented in terms of credit risk, market risk, oper-
ational risk, solvency, compliance/non-negotiable risks and
liquidity risk.

The Risk Appetite framework is further presented in the
Capital and Risk Management Report.

Monitoring and reporting

The “Policy for Internal Control and Risk Management in
the Nordea Group” states that the management of risks
includes all activities aimed at identifying, measuring,
assessing, monitoring and controlling risks as well as meas-
ures to limit and mitigate the consequences of the risks.
Management of risk is proactive, emphasising training and
risk awareness. The Nordea Group maintains a high stand-
ard of risk management by means of applying available
techniques and methodology to its own needs. The control
environment is, among other things, based on the principles
for segregation of duties and independence. Monitoring and
reporting of risk is conducted on a daily basis for market
and liquidity risk and on a monthly and quarterly basis for
credit and operational risk.

Risk reporting, including reporting on the development of
Risk exposure amount (REA), is regularly made to GEM and
the Board of Directors. Group Internal Audit (GIA) makes
an independent evaluation of the processes regarding risk
and capital management in accordance with the annual
audit plan.

Risk management

Credit Risk management

Group Risk Management is responsible for the credit pro-
cess framework and the credit risk management frame-
work, consisting of policies, instructions and guidelines for
the Group. Group Risk Management is responsible for con-
trolling and monitoring the quality of the credit portfolio
and the credit process. Each division/unit is primarily
responsible for managing the credit risks in its operations
within the applicable framework and limits, including
identification, control and reporting.

Within the powers to act granted by the Board of Direc-
tors, credit risk limits are approved by credit decision mak-
ing authorities on different levels in the organisation. The
risk categorisation and the exposure of the customer
decide at what level the decision will be made. Responsi-
bility for a credit risk lies with a customer responsible unit.
Customers are assigned a rating or score in accordance
with Nordea’s rating and scoring guidelines.

Credit risk definition and identification

Credit risk is defined as the risk of loss if customers fail to
fulfil their agreed obligations and that the pledged collat-
eral does not cover the existing claims. Credit risk stems
mainly from various forms of lending, but also from guar-
antees and documentary credits, counterparty credit risk
in derivatives contracts, transfer risk attributable to the
transfer of money from another country and settlement
risk. For monitoring of the distribution of a portfolio,
improving the risk management and defining a common
strategy towards specific industries there are industry
credit principles and industry credit policies in place estab-
lishing requirements and caps.

Individual and collective assessment of impairment
Throughout the process of identifying and mitigating
credit impairments, Nordea continuously reviews the
quality of the credit exposures. Weak and impaired expo-
sures are closely and continuously monitored and
reviewed at least on a quarterly basis in terms of current
performance, business outlook, future debt service capac-
ity and the possible need for provisions.

A provision is recognised if there is objective evidence
based on loss events and observable data that the custom-
er’s future cash flow is weakened to the extent that full
repayment is unlikely, collateral included. Exposures with
provisions are considered as impaired. The size of the pro-
vision is equal to the estimated loss being the difference of
the book value of the outstanding exposure and the dis-
counted value of the future cash flow, including the value
of pledged collateral. Impaired exposures can be either
performing or non-performing. Exposures that have been
past due more than 90 days are by definition regarded as
non-performing, and reported as impaired or not impaired
depending on the deemed loss potential.

Forbearance is negotiated terms or restructuring due to
borrowers’ financial stress. The intention with granting
forbearance for a limited period of time is to ensure full
repayment of the outstanding debt. Examples of negoti-
ated terms are changes in amortisation profile, repayment
schedule, customer margin as well as ease of financial cov-
enants. Forbearance is undertaken on a selective and indi-
vidual basis and followed by impairment testing. Loan loss


--- Page 30 ---

provisions are taken if necessary. Forborne customers
without impairment charges are fully covered by either
collateral and/or the net present value of future cash flows.

In addition to individual impairment testing of all indi-
vidually significant customers, collective impairment test-
ing is performed for groups of customers that have not
been found to be impaired on individual level. The collec-
tive impairment is based on the migration of rated and
scored customers in the credit portfolio as well as manage-
ment judgement. The assessment of collective impairment
reacts to up- and down-ratings of customers as well as
new customers and customers leaving the portfolio. More-
over, customers going to and from default affect the calcu-
lation. Collective impairment is assessed quarterly for each
legal unit. The rationale for this two-step procedure with
both individual and collective assessment is to ensure that
all incurred losses are accounted for up to and including
each balance sheet day.

Further information on credit risk is presented in Note
G47 to the Financial statements.

Credit portfolio

Credit risk is measured, monitored and segmented in dif-
ferent ways. On-balance lending constitutes the major part
of the credit portfolio and the basis for impaired loans and
loan losses. Credit risk in lending is measured and pre-
sented as the principle amount of on-balance sheet claims,
ie. loans to credit institutions and to the public, and off
balance sheet potential claims on customers and counter-
parts, net after allowances. Credit risk exposure also
includes the risk related to derivative contracts and securi-
ties financing.

Including off-balance sheet exposures and exposures
related to securities and Life insurance operations, the total
credit risk exposure at year end was EUR 598bn (EUR 581bn
last year). Total credit exposure according to the CRR defini-
tion was at year end after Credit Conversion Factor EUR
488bn (EUR 480bn). See more information and breakdown
of exposure according to the CRR definition in Note G47

and in the Capital and Risk Management Report.

In the following section, lending related to the divested
Polish operation is excluded.

Nordea’s loans to the public increased by 2% to EUR
348bn during 2014 (EUR 342bn in 2013). It is attributable to
an increase of approx. 3% in the corporate portfolio and an
increase of 1% in the household portfolio. The lending to
the public sector was stable. The overall credit quality is
solid with strongly rated customers and a positive effect
from rating migration on total in the portfolio. Out of lend-
ing to the public, corporate customers accounted for 54%
(53%), household customers for 44% (45%) and the public
sector for 2% (2%). Lending in the Baltic countries consti-
tutes 2.0% (2.4%) and the Shipping and offshore industry
2.9% (3.0%) of the Group's total lending to the public. Lend-
ing to companies owned by private equity funds constitutes
less than 3% of total lending, of which 99% are senior loans.
Loans to central banks and credit institutions, mainly in the
form of inter-bank deposits, decreased to EUR 19bn at the
end of 2014 (EUR 22bn).

Loans to corporate customers

Loans to corporate customers at the end of 2014 amounted
to EUR 188bn (EUR 184bn), up 3%. The sector that
increased the most in 2014 was Reverse repurchase agree-
ments while Energy (oil, gas, etc.) and Metals and mining
materials decreased the most. The concentration of the
three largest industries is approximately 20% of total lend-
ing. Real estate remains the largest industry in Nordea’s
lending portfolio, at EUR 42.2bn (EUR 42.5bn). The real
estate portfolio predominantly consists of relatively large
and financially strong companies, with 87% (84%) of the
lending in rating grades 4- and higher. Approx. 40% of the
lending to the real estate industry is to companies manag-
ing mainly residential real estate.

Loans to shipping and offshore decreased by 2% to EUR
10.0bn in 2014 (EUR 10.2bn). The portfolio is well diversified
by type of vessel, has a focus on large and financially robust
industrial players and exhibits strong credit quality, with an

average rating of 4. Nordea is a leading bank to the global
shipping and offshore industry with strong brand recogni-
tion and a world leading loan syndication franchise. Reflect-
ing Nordea’s global customer strategy, there is an even dis-
tribution between Nordic and non-Nordic customers.

The distribution of loans to corporates by size of loans
shows a high degree of diversification where approx. 73%
(71%) of the corporate volume is for loans up to EUR 50m
per customer.

Credit risk mitigation is an inherent part of the credit
decision process. In every credit decision and review, the
valuation of collaterals is considered as well as the ade-
quacy of covenants and other risk mitigations.

Pledging of collateral is the main credit risk mitigation
technique. In corporate exposures, the main collateral
types are real estate mortgages, floating charges and leas-
ing objects. Collateral coverage is higher for exposures to
financially weaker customers than for those who are
financially strong.

Rating distribution IRB Corporate customers

Regarding large exposures, syndication of loans is the
primary tool for managing concentration risk, while credit
risk mitigation by the use of credit default swaps is applied
to a limited extent.

Covenants in credit agreements are an important comple-
ment to both secured and unsecured exposures. Most expo-
sures of substantial size and complexity include appropriate
covenants. Financial covenants are designed to react to early
warning signs and are carefully monitored.

Loans to household customers

In 2014 lending to household customers increased by 1% to
EUR 154bn (EUR 153bn). Mortgage loans increased slightly
to EUR 126bn (EUR 125bn) and consumer loans were sta-
ble at EUR 28bn. The proportion of mortgage loans of total
household loans was unchanged at 82%, of which the Nor-
dic market accounted for 98%.

Geographical distribution
Lending to the public distributed by borrower domicile
shows that the customers residing in the Nordic countries,
Baltic countries and Russia account for 89% (89%). The
portfolio is geographically well diversified with no market
accounting for more than 28% of total lending. Other EU
countries represent the main part of lending outside the
Nordic countries.

At the end of 2014, lending to customers in the Baltic
countries was EUR 8.4bn (EUR 8.2bn), and to Russian cus-
tomers EUR 4.3bn (EUR 4.5bn).

Rating and scoring distribution

One way of assessing credit quality is through analysis of
the distribution across rating grades, for rated corporate
customers and institutions, as well as risk grades for
scored household and small business customers, ie retail
exposures.

The credit quality was slightly improved in the corporate
credit portfolio as well as in the scoring portfolio in 2014. 28%
of the number of corporate customers migrated upwards
(26%) while 21% were down-rated (23%). Exposure-wise, 24%
(21%) of the corporate customer exposure migrated upwards
while 16% (20%) was down-rated.

84% (82%) of the corporate exposure were rated 4— or
higher, with an average rating for this portfolio of 4+. Institu-
tions and retail customers on the other hand exhibit a distri-
bution that is biased towards the higher rating grades. 91%
(92%) of the retail exposures is scored C- or higher, which
indicates a probability of default of 1% or lower. Impaired

Impaired loans

Impaired loans gross in the Group decreased to EUR
6,425m (EUR 6,564m), corresponding to 174 basis points of
total loans (178 bps). 64% of impaired loans gross are per-
forming and 36% are non-performing. Impaired loans net,
after allowances for individually assessed impaired loans
amounted to EUR 4,096m (EUR 4,167m), corresponding to
111 basis points of total loans (113 bps). Allowances for
individually assessed loans decreased slightly to EUR
2,329m from EUR 2,397m. Allowances for collectively
assessed loans were stable at EUR 420m from EUR 422m.
The ratio of individual allowances to cover impaired loans
decreased to 36% and total allowances in relation to
impaired loans were unchanged at 43%.

The decrease in impaired loans was mainly related to the
improved conditions in the shipping industry, where a
decrease in impaired loans of EUR 341m was seen in 2014.
The industries with the largest increases in impaired loans
were Consumer durables in Denmark and Norway, and
Paper and forest materials in Finland.

Past due loans 6 days or more to corporate customers that
are not considered impaired decreased significantly to EUR

628m (EUR 1,209m), mainly due to improvements in Den-
mark, and past due loans to household customers decreased
to EUR 1,258m (EUR 1,470m) in 2014.

tive contract defaults prior to maturity of the contract and
that Nordea at that time has a claim on the counterpart.
Counterparty credit risk can also exist in repurchasing
agreements and other securities financing transactions.

For information about financial instruments subject to
master netting agreement, se note G41.

Market risk

Market risk is defined as the risk of loss in Nordea’s hold-
ings and transactions as a result of changes in market rates
and parameters that affect the market value, for example
changes to interest rates, credit spreads, FX rates, equity
prices, commodity prices and option volatilities.

Nordea Markets, Group Treasury and Group Asset and
Liability Management are the key contributors to market
risk in the Nordea Group. Nordea Markets is responsible
for the customer-driven trading activities, Group Treasury
is responsible for funding activities and investments for
Nordea’s own account, and Group Asset and Liability
Management is responsible for asset and liability manage-
ment, liquidity portfolios and pledge/collateral account
portfolios. For all other banking activities, market risks are
managed by Group Treasury and Group Asset and Liabil-
ity Management.

Structural FX risk arises from investments in subsidiar-
ies and associated enterprises denominated in foreign cur-
rencies. Generally, Nordea hedges investments by matched
funding, although exceptions may be made in markets
where matched funding is impossible to obtain, or can be
obtained only at an excessive cost.

Earnings and cost streams generated in foreign curren-
cies or from foreign branches generate an FX exposure,
which for the individual Nordea companies is handled in
each company’s FX position. Currency translation differ-
ences in the Group’s equity are generally the difference of
equity and goodwill in foreign currency less net invest-
ment hedges and tax.

In addition to the immediate change in the market value
of Nordea’s assets and liabilities that could be caused by a
change in financial market variables, a change in interest
rates could also affect the net interest income over time.
This is structural interest income risk (SIIR) which is dis-
cussed further below.

Market risk on Nordea’s account also arises from the
Nordea-sponsored defined benefit pension plans for
employees (pension risk) and from the investment of poli-
cyholders’ money with guaranteed minimum yields in Life
& Pensions.

Measurement of market risk

Nordea calculates value-at-risk (VaR) using historical sim-
ulation. The current portfolio is revaluated using the daily
changes in market prices and parameters observed during
the last 500 trading days, thus generating a distribution of

499 returns based on empirical data. From this distribu-
tion, the expected shortfall method is used to calculate a
VaR figure, meaning that the VaR figure is based on the
average of the worst outcomes from the distribution. The
1-day VaR figure is subsequently scaled to a 10-day figure.
The 10-day VaR figure is used to limit and measure mar-
ket risk both in the trading book and in the banking book.

Separate VaR figures are calculated for interest rate, credit
spread, foreign exchange rate and equity risks. The total
VaR includes all these risk categories and allows for diversi-
fication among them. The VaR figures include both linear
positions and options. The model has been calibrated to
generate a 99% VaR figure. This means that the 10-day VaR
figure can be interpreted as the loss that will be exceeded in
one out of a hundred 10-day trading periods.

It is important to note that while every effort is made to
make the VaR model as realistic as possible, all VaR models
are based on assumptions and approximations that have
significant effect on the risk figures produced. While his-
torical simulation has the advantage of not being depend-
ent on a specific assumption regarding the distribution of
returns, it should be noted that the historical observations
of the market variables that are used as input may not give
an adequate description of the behaviour of these variables
in the future. The choice of the time period used is also
important. While using a longer time period may enhance
the model's predictive properties and lead to reduced cycli-
cality, using a shorter time period increases the model's
responsiveness to sudden changes in the volatility of finan-
cial markets. Nordea’s choice to use the last 500 days of
historical data has thus been made with the aim to strike a
balance between the pros and cons from using longer or
shorter time series in the calculation of VaR.

Market risk analysis
The consolidated market risk for Nordea, presented in the
table above, includes both the trading book and the bank-
ing book. The total VaR was EUR 43m at the end of 2014
(EUR 148m at the end of 2013). The decrease in total VaR
over the year is mainly related to the decrease in interest
rate VaR which is a reflection of changed positions and a
decreased interest rate level. Interest rate VaR was EUR
37m (EUR 153m), whereof half is driven by USD and EUR
exposures. Commodity risk was at an insignificant level.
The fair value of the portfolio of illiquid alternative
investments was EUR 448m at the end of 2014 (EUR 497m
at the end of 2013), of which private equity funds EUR
190m, hedge funds EUR 134m, credit funds EUR 112m and
seed-money investments EUR 12m. All four types of invest-
ments are spread over a number of funds.

Structural Interest Income Risk (SIIR)
SIIR is the amount by which Nordea’s accumulated net
interest income would change during the next 12 months if
all interest rates were to change by one percentage point.
SIIR reflects the mismatches in the balance sheet items
and the off-balance sheet items when the interest rate
repricing periods, volumes or the reference rates of assets,
liabilities and derivatives do not correspond exactly.
Nordea’s SIIR management is based on policy statements
resulting in different SIIR measures and organisational proce-
dures. Policy statements focus on optimising financial struc-
ture, balanced risk taking and reliable earnings growth, iden-
tification of all significant sources of SIIR, measurement under
stressful market conditions and adequate public information.
Group Corporate Centre has the responsibility for the
operational management of SIIR.

SIIR measurement methods

Nordea’s SITR is measured through dynamic simulations
by calculating several net interest income scenarios and
comparing the difference between these scenarios. Several
interest rate scenarios are applied, but the basic measures
for SIIR are the two scenarios (increasing rates and
decreasing rates). These scenarios measure the effect on
Nordea’s net interest income for a 12 month period of a one
percentage point change in all interest rates. The balance
sheet is assumed to be constant over time, however main
elements of customer behaviour and Nordea’s decision-
making process concerning Nordea’s own rates are taken
into account.

SIIR analysis

At the end of the year, the SIIR for increasing market rates
was EUR 384m (EUR 409m) and the SIIR for decreasing
market rates was EUR -160m (EUR —466m) These figures
imply that net interest income would increase if interest
rates rise and decrease if interest rates fall.

Operational risk

Operational risk is defined as the risk of direct or indirect
loss, or damaged reputation, resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, from people and systems, or from
external events. Operational risk includes legal risk and
compliance risk, which is the risk of business not being
conducted according to obligations pursuant to laws, stat-
utes and other regulations applicable to the operations
subject to authorisation, and internal rules thereby jeop-

Nordea Annual Report 2014

ardizing customers’ best interest, other stakeholders trust
and increasing the risk of regulatory sanctions, financial
loss or damage to the reputation and confidence. Opera-
tional risk is inherent in all activities within the organisa-
tion, in outsourced activities and in all interactions with
external parties.

Managing operational risk is part of the management’s
responsibilities. The operational risks are monitored
through regular risk assessment procedures and a system-
atic, quality and risk focused management of changes.
Development of new products, services, activities as well
as processes and systems shall be risk assessed. Identified
risk elements and consequences of risk events are miti-
gated with, inter alia, up to date Business Continuity Plans
as well as Group Crisis Management and Communication
plans ensuring a good contingency preparedness in all
business plans and crisis management structures. External
risk transfer is used in the form of insurance, including
reinsurance, to cover certain aspects of crime risk and pro-
fessional liability, including the liability of directors and
officers. Nordea furthermore uses insurance for travel,
property and general liability purposes.

The key principle for the management of Operational
risks is the three lines of defence. The first line of defence is
represented by the Business Areas and Group Functions
who are responsible for their own daily risk management
and for operating their business within limits for risk expo-
sure and in accordance with decided framework for internal
control and risk management at first line of defence. The
control functions Group Operational Risk, in Group Risk
Management, and Group Compliance are in the second line
of defence responsible for activities such as independently
monitoring, controlling and reporting of issues related to
key risks, including compliance with internal and external
regulations. Group Internal Audit performs audits and pro-
vides assurance to stakeholders on internal controls and risk
management processes in third line of defence.

The key process for management of operational risks is
the annual Operational Risk Assessment process. The pro-
cess includes the risk and control self-assessment (RCSA)
and the scenario analysis, and puts focus on both the risks
on a divisional and unit level threatening its daily activi-
ties and the risks which could cause extreme financial
losses or other significant impacts to Nordea as well as
ensuring fulfilment of requirements specified in Group
directives. The risks are identified both through top-down
and through bottom-up analysis of results obtained from
control questions as well as existing information from pro-
cesses, such as incident reporting, scenario analysis, qual-
ity and risk analyses as well as product approvals. The
timing of this process is synchronised with the annual
planning process to be able to ensure adequate input to the
Group’s overall prioritisations.

With the sanction imposed by the Swedish FSA on Nor-
dea in 2013, Nordea has continued and further increased
its efforts to ensure compliance in the areas of anti-money
laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions
management during 2014. A large part of the focus has
been on obtaining full KYC information on existing cus-
tomers, where major progress has been made in all Busi-
ness Areas. Though, given the complexity of the issues
both from a regulatory perspective and an organisational
perspective, the work to complete this will continue during
2015 and 2016, primarily in Retail Banking where most of


--- Page 36 ---

the customers are located. In addition, new processes for
making sure the proper KYC is in place for new customers
have been rolled out along with training related to KYC
processes and procedures. Furthermore, Nordea has con-
tinued to strengthen its automated monitoring of suspi-
cious activities as well as expanded its screening of trans-
actions against international sanctions lists. The AML area
is in focus also from the supervisory authorities. The
supervisory authorities, including the Swedish FSA, have
during 2014 conducted ongoing investigations with
regards to Nordea’s compliance to the AML requirements
which for some investigations covers several years. The
outcome of the investigations is pending and it cannot be
excluded that these investigations could lead to criticism or
sanctions.

Life insurance risk and market risks in the

Life & Pensions operations

The Life & Pensions business of Nordea Life & Pensions
generally consists of a range of different life & health prod-
ucts, from endowments with a duration of a few years to
very long term pension savings contracts, with durations
of more than 40 years. There is a strategic move away from
traditional business, where policyholders are offered guar-
anteed investment returns to market return business,
where policyholders bear more of the investment risk and
benefit from any upside in the return achieved. The two
major risks in the life insurance business continue to be
market risk and life & health insurance risks.

Market risk arises due to a mismatch between assets and
liabilities and the sensitivity of the values of these assets
and liabilities to change in the level or in the volatility of
market prices or rates. In addition, market risk arises from
the investment of the shareholders’ equity. The market risk
is mitigated through liability driven investment where
appropriate aiming at reducing the asset-liability mis-
match, while at the same time creating an investment
return enabling Nordea Life & Pensions to meet the guar-
antees offered and customer's expectations.

The life and health insurance risk is the risk of unex-
pected losses due to changes in the level, trend or volatility
of mortality rates, longevity rates, disability rates, surren-
der/lapse risks and selection effects. These risks are primar-
ily controlled using actuarial methods, i.e. through tariffs,
rules for acceptance of customers, reinsurance contracts,
stress tests and setting up adequate provisions for risks.

Board of Directors’ report

Liquidity management

Key issues during 2014

During 2014, Nordea continued to benefit from its focus on
prudent liquidity risk management, in terms of maintain-
ing a diversified and strong funding base. Nordea had
access to all relevant financial markets and was able to
actively use all of its funding programmes. Nordea issued
approx. EUR 22bn in long-term debt, of which approx.
EUR 13bn in the Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian covered
bond markets. Swedish FSA introduced Liquidity Cover-
age Ratio (LCR) requirement in the beginning of 2013, and
Nordea is LCR compliant in all currencies combined and
separately in USD and EUR.

Management principles and control

Group Corporate Centre is responsible for pursuing the
Nordea’s liquidity strategy, managing the liquidity and for
compliance with the group-wide limits set by the Board of
Directors and the Risk Committee. Furthermore, Group
Asset & Liability Management develops the liquidity risk
management frameworks, which consist of policies,
instructions and guidelines for the Group as well as the
principles for pricing liquidity risk.

The Board of Directors defines the liquidity risk appetite
by setting limits for applied liquidity risk measures. The
most central measure is survival horizon, which defines
the risk appetite by setting the minimum survival of one
month under institution-specific and market-wide stress
scenarios with limited mitigation actions.

Liquidity risk management

Liquidity risk is the risk of being able to meet liquidity
commitments only at increased cost or, ultimately, being
unable to meet obligations as they fall due. Nordea’s
liquidity management and strategy is based on policy
statements resulting in various liquidity risk measures,
limits and organisational procedures.

Policy statements stipulate that Nordea’s liquidity mana-
gement reflects a conservative attitude towards liquidity
risk. Nordea strives to diversify its sources of funding and
seeks to establish and maintain relationships with investors
in order to ensure market access. A broad and diversified
funding structure is reflected by the strong presence in the
Group’s four domestic markets in the form of a strong and
stable retail customer base and the variety of funding pro-
grammes. Funding programmes are both short-term (US
commercial paper, European commercial paper, commercial
paper, Certificates of Deposits) and long-term (covered
bonds, European medium-term notes, medium term notes)
and cover a range of currencies.

Nordea’s funding sources are presented in a table below.
As of year-end 2014, the total volume utilised under short-
term programmes was EUR 53.1bn (EUR 52.3bn) with the
average maturity being 0.3 (0.2) years. The total volume
under long-term programmes was EUR 141.2bn (EUR
133.3bn) with average maturity being 6.4 (5.8) years. During
2014, the volume of long-term programmes increased by
EUR 7.9bn whilst the volume of short-term programmes
increased by EUR 0.8bn. Trust is fundamental in the fun-
ding market, therefore Nordea periodically publishes infor-
mation on the liquidity situation of the Group.

Nordea’s liquidity risk management includes stress tes-
ting and a business continuity plan for liquidity manage-

ment. Stress testing is defined as the evaluation of potential
effects on a bank’s liquidity situation under a set of excep-
tional but plausible events. Stress testing framework inclu-
des also survival horizon metrics (see below), which repre-
sents a combined liquidity risk scenario (idiosyncratic and
market-wide stress).

Liquidity risk measurement methods

The liquidity risk management focuses on both short-term
liquidity risk and long-term structural liquidity risk. In
order to manage short-term funding positions, Nordea
measures the funding gap risk, which expresses the
expected maximum accumulated need for raising liquidity
in the course of the next 30 days. Cash flows from both
on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are included.
Funding gap risk is measured and limited for each cur-
rency and as a total figure for all currencies combined. The
total figure for all currencies combined is limited by the
Board of Directors.

To ensure funding in situations where Nordea is in
urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do
not suffice, Nordea holds a liquidity buffer. The buffer
minimum level is set by the Board of Directors. The
liquidity buffer consists of central bank eligible high-grade
liquid securities held by Group Corporate Centre that can
be readily sold or used as collateral in funding operations.

During 2011, the Survival horizon metric was intro-
duced. It is conceptually similar to Basel Liquidity Cover-
age Ratio. The metric is composed of the liquidity buffer
and funding gap risk cash flows, and includes expected
behavioural cash flows from contingent liquidity drivers.
Survival horizon defines the short-term liquidity risk
appetite of the Group and expresses the excess liquidity
after a 30-day period without access to market funding.

The Board of Directors has set the limit for minimum
survival without access to market funding during 30 days.

The structural liquidity risk of Nordea is measured and
limited by the Board of Directors through the NBSF, which
is defined as the difference between stable liabilities and
stable assets. These liabilities primarily comprise retail
deposits, bank deposits and bonds with a remaining term
to maturity of more than 12 months, as well as sharehold-
ers’ equity, while stable assets primarily comprise retail
loans, other loans with a remaining term to maturity
longer than 12 months and committed facilities. The CEO
in GEM has set as a target that the NBSF should be posi-
tive, which means that stable assets must be funded by
stable liabilities.

Liquidity risk analysis

The short-term liquidity risk remained at moderate levels
throughout 2014. The average funding gap risk, i.e. the
average expected need for raising liquidity in the course of
the next 30 days, was EUR +11.3bn (EUR +16.8bn). Nor-
dea’s liquidity buffer range was EUR 59.5 — 67.3bn (EUR
58.2bn — 72.5bn) throughout 2014 with an average buffer
size of EUR 62.5bn (EUR 64.4bn). Nordea’s liquidity buffer
is highly liquid, consisting of only central bank eligible
securities held by Group Treasury, as shown in the table
below. Survival horizon was in the range EUR 42.1bn —
54.7bn (EUR 49.0bn — 68.2bn) throughout 2014 with an
average of EUR 46.9bn (EUR 59.0bn). The aim of always
maintaining a positive NBSF was comfortably achieved
throughout 2014. The yearly average for the NBSF was
EUR 51.1bn (EUR 52.8bn).

Nordea Annual Report 2014

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for the Nordea
Group was at the end of 2014 149% (117%) with yearly
average of 131%. At the end of 2014 the LCR in EUR was
307% (140%) and in USD 169% (127%), with yearly aver-
ages of 194% and 136%, respectively.

Capital management

Capital management

Nordea strives to be efficient in its use of capital and there-
fore actively manages its balance sheet with respect to dif-
ferent asset, liability and risk categories. The goal is to
enhance returns to shareholders while maintaining a pru-
dent capital structure.

The Board of Directors decides ultimately on the targets
for capital ratios, capital policy and the overall framework
of capital management in Nordea.

The ability to meet targets and to maintain minimum
capital requirements is reviewed regularly within the Asset
and Liability Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee.

Capital requirements

The capital requirement and the own funds described in
this section follow the CRR rules and not accounting
standards, see Note G38 for details. Therefore the capital
requirement and the own funds are only applicable for
Nordea Bank AB (publ) on its consolidated situation, in
which the insurance companies are not consolidated.

Board of Directors’ report

Capital policy

The current capital policy states that Nordea Group should
have a target minimum of 13% in CET1 and 17% in total
capital ratio. The most recent review, performed in the
fourth quarter of 2014 leaves the capital targets unchanged
as there are still uncertainties with respect to the Swedish
FSA's view on standardised models to be used by the
banks for calculating the size of the pillar II add-on, as
well as other on-going regulatory uncertainties such as
the replacement of the current capital floor. The capital
policy will be revised once the regulatory regime is fur-
ther clarified. However, Nordea’s current view is that the
bank should operate with a CET] ratio of approximately
15%, including a management buffer, although there is
still some regulatory uncertainty.

Minimum capital requirements

Risk exposure amount (REA), previously referred to as
risk-weighted assets or RWA, is calculated in accordance
with the requirements in the CRR. Nordea had 80% of the
credit risk exposure covered by internal rating based (IRB)
approaches by the end of 2014. Nordea aims to implement
the IRB approach for some remaining portfolios. During
the first quarter of 2014 Nordea implemented the
advanced IRB approach for the Group’s corporate expo-
sures in the Nordic region. In the fourth quarter, Nordea
was approved to use the retail IRB approach for the major-
ity of the retail exposures in Finland which were not pre-
viously reported in IRB.

Nordea is approved to use its own internal Value-at-Risk
(VaR) models to calculate capital requirements for the major
share of the market risk in the trading book. For operational
risk the standardised approach is applied.

Internal capital requirement

Nordea bases its internal capital requirements under the
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)
on risks defined by Capital Requirements Directive (CRD)
and risks internally defined under Pillar II. The following
major risk types are included in the internal capital
requirement: credit risk, market risk, operational risk and
business risk. Additionally, interest rate risk in the bank-
ing book, risk in Nordea’s sponsored defined benefit pen-
sion plans, real estate risk and concentration risk are
explicitly accounted for.

In addition to calculating risk capital for its various risk
types, Nordea conducts a comprehensive capital adequacy
stress test to analyse the effects of a series of global and local
shock scenarios. The results of the stress tests are considered,
along with potential management interventions, in Nordea’s
internal capital requirements as buffers for economic stress.
The internal capital requirement is a key component of Nor-
dea’s capital ratio target setting.

The ICAAP also describes Nordea's management, mitiga-
tion and measurement of material risks and assesses the
adequacy of internal capital by defining internal capital
requirements reflecting the risk of the institution. However,
regulatory buffers are being introduced with the implemen-
tation of CRD IV which might lead to higher capitalisation
requirements than what is determined in the internal capital
requirement.

Economic Capital (EC)
Economic Capital is a method for allocating the cost of
holding capital, as a result of risk taking, and is a central
component in the Economic Profit (EP) framework. The
allocation of costs within the EC model is based on the
same risk components as the ICAAP but also includes
tisks in the insurance businesses. EC is calculated for the
conglomerate whereas the ICAAP, which is governed by
the CRD, covers only Nordea Bank AB (publ) on its con-
solidated situation. EC has been aligned to CET1 capitali-
sation requirements according to CRR. Additional capital
items were introduced in the EC during 2014 to reduce the
gap between legal equity and allocated capital.

Economic Capital (EC including Nordea Life and Pen-
sions) was at the end of 2014 EUR 23.9bn (EUR 24.4bn as of
2013, restated).

Economic Profit (EP)

Nordea uses EP as one of its financial performance indica-
tors. EP is calculated as risk-adjusted profit less the cost of
equity. Risk-adjusted profit and EP are measures to sup-
port performance management and for shareholder value
creation. In investment decisions and customer relation-
ships, EP drives and supports the operational decision
making process in Nordea. The EP model also captures
both growth and return. EC and expected losses (EL) are
inputs in the EP framework.

Expected losses (EL)

EL reflects the normalised loss level of the individual
credit exposure over a business cycle as well as various
portfolios. During 2014 there were no changes to the EL
framework apart from the regular update of parameters
based on the latest validations.

The EL ratio used in the EP framework, calculated as EL
divided by exposure at default (EAD), was 12 basis points
as of year-end 2014 (13 basis points as of 2013) excluding
the sovereign exposure class.

EL is a more stable measure than actual losses, but it
will vary with the business cycle as a consequence of
shifts in the repayment capacity (PD dimension) and col-
lateral coverage (LGD dimension) distributions.

Own funds

Own funds is the sum tier 1 and tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capi-
tal consists of both common equity tier 1 (CET1) and addi-
tional tier 1 capital. CET1 capital is considered to be capital
of the highest quality with ultimate loss-absorbance char-
acteristics and consists predominately of paid in capital
and retained earnings. Profit may only be included after
permission from the financial supervisory authority and
after deduction of proposed dividend. Due to the imple-
mentation of CRR deductions that according to previous
tules were made 50 % from tier 1 and 50 % from tier 2 are
now fully deducted from common equity tier 1. Further-
more, CRR also changed the treatment of investments in
financial sector entities and deferred tax assets that rely on
future profitability and arise from temporary differences,
which are now risk weighted instead of deducted from tier
land tier 2.

Additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital consist mostly of
undated and dated subordinated loans, respectively. Hold-
ings of other financial sector entities’ subordinated loans
are deducted from the corresponding tier.

New regulations

The Capital Requirement Directive IV (CRD IV) and Capital
Requirement Regulation (CRR) entered into force from 1 Jan-
uary 2014. The CRR became applicable in all EU countries
from 1 January 2014 while the CRD IV was implemented
through national law within all EU member states during
2014, through national processes.

Parts of the CRD IV/CRR are still being phased-in. As com-
municated by Swedish authorities already in 2011 the Com-
mon Equity Tier 1(CET1) requirement for the four large Swed-
ish banks will be 12% from 2015. This has been achieved by
setting the capital conservation buffer to 2.5% CET1 and by
activating the systemic risk buffer to 3% from 2015. In addi-
tion there has been an additional systemic risk buffer require-
ment of 2% CET1 within Pillar II from September 2014. On
top of the 12% CET1 requirement, the Swedish FSA has
decided that the countercyclical capital buffer will be set to 1%
CET! for Swedish exposures from 13 September 2015.

Updates on Basel Ill and the CRD IV/CRR

On 22 December 2014 the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS) published a consultation on the design
of a permanent floor, replacing the current Basel I (transi-
tional) floor. The proposal is that the floor shall be based
on the revised standardised approaches for credit-, mar-
ket- and operational risks that is currently, or has recently
been, on consultation. The intention from the BCBS is to
finalise the work by end-2015.

In December 2014 the Swedish FSA published a proposal
for standardised methods for assessing the capital adequacy
requirement within Pillar II for concentration risk, interest
rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and pension risk. The
intention is to use the methods in the SREP in 2015.

The CRR introduced a non-risk based measure, the lever-
age ratio, in order to limit an excessive build-up of leverage
on credit institutions’ balance sheets. The impact of the ratio
is being monitored by the supervisory authorities with an
aim to migrate to a binding measure in 2018. The leverage
ratio will be calculated as the tier 1 capital divided by the
exposure (on-balance and off-balance sheet exposures, with
adjustments for certain items such as derivatives and securi-
ties financing transactions). On 17 January 2015 a revised
version of the calculation of the leverage ratio was published
in the Official Journal entering into force the day after. The
revised version is an update of the CRR to be more in line
with the BCBS leverage ratio framework from January 2014.

The CRR also introduces two new quantitative liquidity
standards; liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable fund-
ing ratio (NSFR). LCR requires that a bank hold liquidity buff-
ers which are adequate to face any possible imbalance between
liquidity inflows and outflows under gravely stressed condi-
tions over a period of 30 days. The EU Commission has pub-
lished a delegated act on LCR specifying details for calcula-
tions of inflows and outflows. The detailed LCR rules will
enter into force on 1 October 2015 with phase-in of 60% in
2015, 70% in 2016, 80% in 2017 and 100% in 2018. NSFR
requires that a bank shall ensure that long term obligations are
adequately met with a diversity of stable funding instruments
under both normal and stressed conditions. BCBS published a
final recommendation on NSFR in October 2014 with the
intention to introduce NSFR as a minimum standard in 2018.
Within the EU, the EU Commission is expected to present a
proposal by late 2016, if it is deemed appropriate.

Board of Directors’ report

Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive

The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)
was published in the Official Journal in June 2014 together
with the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Scheme. The
BRRD outlines the tools and powers available to the rele-
vant authorities in the EU, which are aimed at both prevent-
ing bank defaults as well as handling banks in crises, while
maintaining financial stability. The DGS strengthens the
protection of citizens’ deposits in case of bank failures. The
BRRD require banks to draw up recovery plans to describe
the measures they would take in order to remain viable if
their financial situation is considerably weakened. The
BRRD also sets the minimum requirement for own funds
and eligible liabilities (MREL) for all EU banks. In Novem-
ber 2014, the EBA published a technical standard describing
the calculation of the MREL requirement. The final version
of the EBA technical standard will be applied for all EU
banks at the latest in 2016. In November 2014 the Financial
Stability Board (FSB) published a consultation on the total
loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). The TLAC is intended to
ensure adequate availability of loss-absorbing capacity for
global systemic banks in resolution, similar to the MREL.
The TLAC requirement will not be applied before 2019.

Bank structural reform

In February 2012, the EU Commission established a high-
level expert group (HLEG) with the task to assess whether
additional reforms on the structure of individual banks
should be considered. The HLEG answer to the task was
presented in a report in October 2012 and suggested man-
datory separation of proprietary trading and other high-
risk trading activities from the normal banking activities.
The main purpose would be to separate certain particu-
larly risky parts of financial activities from deposit taking
activities within a banking group. The underlying objec-
tive is to make deposit taking banks safer and less con-
nected to trading activities. Risky financial activities are
defined as proprietary trading and all securities or deriva-
tives incurred in the process of market-making as well as
exposures towards hedge funds, private equity invest-
ments and structured investment vehicles.

Solvency Il

The Solvency II regime, which will come into force from 1

January 2016, introduces a consistent prudential frame-

work for insurance regulation across Europe. The main

objectives of Solvency II are to:

¢ have a forward-looking risk-based solvency capital
assessment and replace the old “volume-based” capital
requirement framework

¢ ensure that the risk ownership is anchored with execu-
tive management and the Board of Directors

¢ ensure that the risk measurement and governance is
embedded into business operations and strategic planning

strengthen the supervision of insurance groups.

Accounting

Nordea’s accounting policies, which follow IFRS, are under
change. Nordea’s assessment is that the most important
changes are related to Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and
Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4), although other changes might
also have an impact on Nordea. IFRS 9 will become manda-
tory from 2018 if endorsed in the EU. The finalisation dates
and effective dates for the amended IFRS 4 is still pending.

Corporate Governance Report 2014

Strong corporate governance is about companies having
clear and systematic decision-making processes, thus pro-
viding clarity about responsibilities, avoiding conflicts of
interest and ensuring satisfactory internal control, risk man-
agement and transparency. Commitment to Nordea’s mis-
sion and vision requires the integration of sound corporate
governance practices into regular business activities in order
to, attain — as far as possible — a company that is well gov-
erned and well managed.

This Corporate Governance Report is prepared in accord-
ance with the requirements in the Swedish Annual
Accounts Act and the Swedish Code of Corporate Govern-
ance (the Code). The main emphasis is on the Board of
Directors in its role as the main decision-making body in
Nordea’s corporate governance structure, and the interac-
tion with the other bodies to ensure sound corporate gov-
ernance. Nordea’s system for internal control and risk man-
agement regarding financial reporting is also covered.

Corporate governance at Nordea

Nordea Bank AB (publ) is a Swedish public limited company
listed on the Nasdaq stock exchanges in Stockholm, Hel-
sinki and Copenhagen. Corporate governance at Nordea
follows generally adopted principles of corporate govern-
ance. The external framework that regulates corporate gov-
ernance work includes the Swedish Companies Act, the
Banking and Financing Business Act, the Annual Accounts
Act, the Annual Accounts Act of Credit Institutions and
Securities Companies, EU regulations for the financial
industry, rules issued by relevant financial supervisory
authorities, the Nasdaq's rules for each stock exchange and

Nomination process (2)

The AGM 2014 decided to establish a Nomination Com-
mittee with the task of proposing Board members, the
Chairman of the Board and auditor as well as remunera-
tion for the Board members and auditor to the AGM 2015.

The Nomination Committee shall comprise the Chair-
man of the Board (Bjérn Wahlroos) and four members
appointed by the four largest shareholders in terms of vot-
ing rights on 31 August 2014, who wish to participate in
the Committee.

The composition of the Nomination Committee was
made public on 16 September 2014. Sampo ple had
appointed Torbjérn Magnusson, Nordea-fonden had
appointed Mogens Hugo, Alecta had appointed Per Frenn-
berg and The Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund had
appointed Monica Caneman. Torbjérn Magnusson had
been appointed chairman of the Nomination Committee.
At the date of constitution, the Nomination Committee
represented 28.7% of the shareholders’ votes.

The proposals of the Nomination Committee are pre-
sented in the notice of the AGM 2015 and at
www.nordea.com.

Nordea Board of Directors (3)
Composition of the Board of Directors
According to the Articles of Association, the Board of
Directors consists of at least six and no more than fifteen
members elected by the shareholders at the General Meet-
ing. The term of office for Board members is one year. Nor-
dea has neither a specific retirement age for Board mem-
bers nor a time limit for how long a Board member may
serve on the Board. There are no such requirements in the
external framework.

According to the Articles of Association, the aim is to
ensure that the Board as a whole for the purpose of its

Board of Directors’ report

work possesses the requisite knowledge of and experience
in the social, business and cultural conditions of the
regions and markets in which the main activities of the
Group are carried out. Furthermore, according to the Code,
the board is to have a composition appropriate to the com-
pany’s operations, phase of development and other rele-
vant circumstances. The board members elected by the
General Meeting are collectively to exhibit diversity and
breadth of qualifications, experience and background.
According to the Code, the company is to strive for equal
gender distribution on the board.

All board assignments in Nordea are based on merit
with the prime consideration being to maintain and
enhance the Board's overall effectiveness. In order to fulfil
this, a broad set of qualities and competences are sought
for and it is recognised that diversity, including age, gen-
der, geographical provenance and educational and profes-
sional background, is an important factor to take into con-
sideration.

The Board currently consists of eight members elected
by the General Meeting after Svein Jacobsen’s resignation
of his own accord on 31 July 2014. The resignation was
made public on 17 July 2014.

In addition, three members and one deputy member are
appointed by the employees. Employees are entitled under
Swedish legislation to be represented on the Board. The
CEO of Nordea is not a member of the Board. The compo-
sition of the Board of Directors is shown in the table on
page 51 and further information regarding the Board
members elected by the AGM 2014 is presented in the sec-
tion "Board of Directors" on page 212.

Independence of the Board of Directors

Nordea complies with applicable rules regarding the inde-
pendence of the Board. The Nomination Committee con-
siders all of the members elected by the shareholders to be
independent of the Company and its executive manage-
ment.

All Board members elected by the shareholders, apart
from Bjérn Wahlroos and Kari Stadigh, are independent in
relation to the Company’s major shareholders. Bjérn Wah]-
roos is chairman of Sampo ple and Kari Stadigh is manag-
ing director and CEO of Sampo plc, which owns more than
ten per cent of all shares and votes in Nordea.

Thus, the number of Board members who are independ-
ent in relation to the Company and its executive manage-
ment, and independent in relation to the Company’s major
shareholders, exceeds the minimum requirements.

No Board member elected by the General Meeting is
employed by or works in an operative capacity at the Com-
pany. All Board members and the deputy Board member
appointed by the employees are employed by the Group
and are therefore not independent of the Company.

The independence of the individual Board members is
also shown in the table on page 51.

The work of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors annually establishes its working
plan, in which the management and risk reporting to the
Board is also established. The statutory meeting following
the AGM 2014 elected the vice Chairman and appointed
the Board Committee members. The Board has adopted
written work procedures governing its work and its work
carried out in the Board Committees (the Charter). For
example, the Charter sets forth the Board’s and the Chair-

Nordea Annual Report 2014 49

Board of Directors’ report

50

man’s areas of responsibility, documentation and quorum
as well as the frequency of meetings. It also contains rules
regarding conflicts of interest and confidentiality. Further-
more, the Board of Directors has adopted instructions for
the CEO specifying the CEO’s responsibilities as well as
other charters, policies and instructions for the operations
of the Group. These, together with the Articles of Associa-
tion, the Charter and Nordea’s values, constitute the inter-
nal framework that regulates corporate governance at Nor-
dea. Further information regarding Nordea’s values is
presented in the section Strategy — the future relationship
bank developing, on page 10.

The Board is charged with the organisation of Nordea
and the management of the Company’s operations and the
overall management of the Nordea Group’s affairs in
accordance with the external and internal framework. Fur-
thermore, the Board shall ensure that the Company’s
organisation in respect of accounting, management of
funds and the Company’s financial position in general
includes satisfactory controls. The Board is ultimately
responsible for ensuring that an adequate and effective
system of internal control is established and maintained.
Group Internal Audit (GIA) annually issues to the Board
an overall assurance statement on Nordea’s governance,
risk management and control processes. The assurance
statement for 2014 concludes that the internal control sys-
tem is adequate and effective. Further information regard-
ing internal control within Nordea is provided below
under “Internal Control Process”.

At least once a year, the Board meets the external auditor
without the CEO or any other member of Group Executive
Management (GEM) being present. In addition, the auditor
in charge meets separately with the Chairman of the Board
and with the Chairman of the Board Audit Committee.

In 2014, the Board held ten meetings. Nine meetings
were held in Stockholm, and one in Finland. For more
information see the table on page 51. The Board regularly
follows up on the strategy, financial position and develop-
ment and risks. The financial targets and the strategy are
reviewed on an annual basis. In 2014, the Board also dealt
with for example reports on and issues related to the
financial market and macroeconomic trends, new regula-
tory initiatives, capital and liquidity, Internal Capital Ade-
quacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), internal control,
AML, compliance, the group simplification programme,
the work of the Board Committees, HR and remuneration
issues, and transactions of significance.

The Secretary of the Board of Directors is Lena Eriksson,
Head of Group Legal.

The Chairman

The Chairman of the Board is elected by the shareholders
at the General Meeting. According to the Charter, the
Chairman is to ensure that the Board’s work is conducted
efficiently and that the Board fulfils its duties. The Chair-
man is to organise and lead the Board’s work, maintain
regular contact with the CEO, ensure that the Board
receives sufficient information and documentation and
ensure that the work of the Board is evaluated annually
and that the Nomination Committee is informed of the
result of the evaluation.

Evaluation of the Board

The Board of Directors annually conducts a self-evaluation
process, through which the performance and the work of

Nordea Annual Report 2014

the Board is evaluated and discussed by the Board. The
evaluation is based on methodology that includes ques-
tionnaires to evaluate the Board as a whole, the Chairman
and individual Board members. According to European
regulatory requirements, an internal process has been set
up for assessing the suitability of the Board of Directors as
a whole as well as of the members of the Board of Direc-
tors.

Board Committees

In accordance with the external framework and in order to
increase the effectiveness of the board work, the Board of
Directors has established separate working committees to
assist the Board in preparing matters, belonging to the
competence of the Board and to decide in matters dele-
gated by the Board. The duties of the Board Committees,
as well as working procedures, are defined in the Charter.
Each Committee regularly reports on its work to the
Board. The minutes are communicated to the Board.

The Board Audit Committee (4)

The Board Audit Committee (BAC) assists the Board of
Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by, for
instance, monitoring the Nordea Group’s financial report-
ing process, and, in relation thereto, the effectiveness of
the internal control and risk management systems, estab-
lished by the Board of Directors, the CEO and GEM, as
well as the effectiveness of Group Internal Audit. The BAC
is further accountable for keeping itself informed as to the
statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts
assisting the Nomination Committee in preparing propos-
als on auditors and reviewing and monitoring the impar-
tiality and independence of the external auditors and, in
particular, the provision of additional services to the Nor-
dea Group. In addition, the BAC is accountable for the
guidance and evaluation of the GIA.

Members of the BAC are Tom Knutzen (chairman), as of
AGM 2014 and as chairman as of 31 July 2014, Elisabeth
Grieg and Sarah Russell. Svein Jacobsen was a member
and chairman from the AGM 2014 until his resignation of
his own accord from the Board on 31 July 2014. Generally,
the Group Chief Audit Executive (CAE) and the Chief
Financial Officer (CFO) are present at meetings and are
entitled to participate in discussions, but not in decisions.

According to the Swedish Companies Act and the Code,
the majority of the members of the BAC are to be inde-
pendent of the Company and the executive management
of the Company. At least one of the committee members
who are independent of the Company and its executive
management must also be independent of the Company’s
major shareholders. Nordea follows the legal requirement
as well as complies with the Code. For more information,
see the table on page 51.

The Board Risk Committee (5)

The Board Risk Committee (BRIC) assists the Board of
Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities con-
cerning the management and control of the risks, risk
frameworks, controls and processes associated with the
Group's operations, including credit, market, liquidity,
business, life and operational risk.

The duties of the BRIC include reviewing the develop-
ment of the Group’s overall risk management and control
framework, as well as the Group’s risk profile and key risk
issues. In addition, the BRIC reviews and makes recom-


--- Page 44 ---

mendations regarding the Group’s risk appetite and limits
for market and liquidity risks. Furthermore, the BRIC
reviews resolutions made by lending entities concerning
credits or limits above certain amounts, as well as strategic
credit policy matters and the development of the credit
portfolio.

Members of the BRIC are Kari Stadigh (chairman),
Lars G Nordstrém and Robin Lawther, as of AGM 2014.
Tom Knutzen was a member until the AGM 2014. Gener-
ally, the Head of Group Risk Management and, when
deemed important and to the extent possible, the CEO are
present at meetings and are entitled to participate in dis-
cussions, but not in decisions. Further information regard-
ing the credit decision-making structure for main opera-
tions and risk management within Nordea is presented in
the section “Risk management”, on page 36.

There are no rules on the independence of the BRIC
members in the external framework. For more informa-
tion, see the table on page 51.

The Board Remuneration Committee (6)

The Board Remuneration Committee (BRC) is responsible
for preparing and presenting proposals to the Board of
Directors on remuneration issues. This duty includes pro-
posals regarding the Nordea Remuneration Policy and
underlying instructions, as well as guidelines for remunera-
tion for the executive officers to be decided by the AGM.
The BRC is also responsible for proposals regarding remu-
neration for the CEO, other members of GEM as well as the
CAE and, on the proposal of the CEO, for the Group Com-

Board of Directors’ report

pliance Officer and the Head of Group Credit Control.

At least annually, the BRC follows up on the application
of the Nordea Remuneration Policy and underlying
instructions through an independent review by the GIA,
and exercises an assessment of the Nordea Remuneration
Policy and remuneration system with the participation of
appropriate control functions. The BRC also has the duty
of annually monitoring, evaluating and reporting to the
Board on the programmes for variable remuneration for
GEM, as well as the application of the guidelines for remu-
neration for executive officers. At the request of the Board,
the BRC also prepares other issues of principle for the con-
sideration of the Board.

Members of the BRC are Marie Ehrling (chairman), Peter
F Braunwalder (until AGM 2014) and Bjorn Wahlroos. Gen-
erally, the CEO and the Head of Group Human Resources
are present at the meetings and are entitled to participate
in discussions, but not in decisions. The CEO does not par-
ticipate in considerations regarding his own employment
terms and conditions.

According to the Code, the members of the BRC are to be
independent of the Company and the executive manage-
ment of the Company. Nordea complies with this rule.

Further information regarding remuneration at Nordea
is presented in the separate section “Remuneration”, on
page 55 and in Note G7, on page 97.

the Company as well as to the major shareholders.

The CEO and Group Executive Management (7)
Nordea’s President and CEO is charged with the day-to-
day management of Nordea Bank and the Nordea Group’s
affairs in accordance with the external and internal frame-
work. The internal framework regulates the division of
responsibilities and the interaction between the CEO and
the Board. The CEO works closely with the Chairman of
the Board with the planning of Board meetings.

The CEO is accountable to the Board for the manage-
ment of the Nordea Group’s operations and he is also
responsible for developing and maintaining effective sys-
tems for internal control within the Group. Further infor-
mation regarding the control environment for risk expo-
sures is presented in the section; “Risk, Liquidity and
Capital management”, on page 35. The CEO works
together with executive officers within the Group in GEM.
Presently, GEM consists of six members and the CEO.
GEM meets regularly and whenever necessary upon
request by the CEO. These meetings are chaired by the
CEO, who reaches decisions after consulting with the
other members of GEM. Notes of meetings, verified by the
CEO, are kept. Further information regarding the CEO
and GEM is presented in the section “Group Executive
Management”, on page 214.

Internal control process

The Internal Control Process is carried out by the Board of
Directors, management and other staff at Nordea and is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding objec-
tive fulfilment in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of
operations, reliability of financial and non-financial
reporting, compliance with external and internal regula-
tions, safeguarding of assets as well as sufficient manage-
ment of risks in the operations. The Internal Control Pro-
cess is based on five main components: Control

Nordea Annual Report 2014

Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Infor-
mation & Communication and Monitoring.

The framework for the Internal Control Process aims to
create the necessary fundamentals for the entire organisa-
tion to contribute to the effectiveness and high quality of
internal control through, for instance, clear definitions,
assignments of roles and responsibilities and common
tools and procedures.

Roles and responsibilities with respect to internal con-
trol and risk management are divided into three lines of
defence. In the first line of defence, the business organisa-
tion and Group Functions are responsible for conducting
their business within risk exposure limits and in accord-
ance with the decided internal control and risk manage-
ment framework. As second line of defence, the central-
ised risk group functions are responsible for providing the
internal control and risk management framework. Group
Internal Audit performs audits and provides assurance to
stakeholders on governance, risk management and inter-
nal controls, which is the third line of defence.

Internal audit (8)
Group Internal Audit (GIA) is an independent function
commissioned by the Board of Directors. The Board Audit
Committee is responsible for guidance on and evaluation
of GIA within the Nordea Group. The Group Chief Audit
Executive (CAE) bears overall responsibility for GIA. The
CAE reports on a functional basis to the Board of Direc-
tors and the Board Audit Committee and reports on an
administrative basis to the CEO. The Board of Directors
approves the appointment and dismissal of the CAE.

GIA does not engage in consulting activities unless the
Board Audit Committee gives it special assignments. The
purpose of GIA’s assurance activity is to add value to the
organisation by assuring the quality of the governance,
risk management and control processes, and by promot-
ing continuous improvement.

All activities, including outsourced activities, and enti-
ties of the Nordea Group, fall within the scope of GIA.


--- Page 46 ---

GIA operates without interference in determining the
scope of internal auditing, performing its audit work and
communicating its results. GIA is authorised to carry out
all investigations and obtain all information required to
execute its duties. The work of GIA shall comply with the
Standards for the International Professional Practice of
Internal Auditing issued by the Institute of Internal
Auditors and the Standards for Information Systems
Auditing issued by ISACA. The annual audit plans are
based on a comprehensive risk assessment.

External audit (9)

According to the Articles of Association, one or two audi-
tors must be elected by the General Meeting for a term of
one year. At the AGM 2014, KPMG AB was re-elected
auditor until the end of the AGM 2015. Hans Akervall is
the auditor-in-charge.

Report on internal control and risk management
regarding financial reporting

The systems for internal control and risk management of
financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable
assurance about the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external pur-
poses in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, applicable laws and regulations, and other
requirements for listed companies. The internal control
and risk management activities are included in Nordea’s
planning and resource allocation processes. Internal con-
trol and risk management of financial reporting at Nordea
can be described in accordance with the COSO Frame-
work as follows below.

Control Environment
The control environment constitutes the basis for Nordea’s
internal control and contains the culture and values estab-
lished by the Board of Directors and executive manage-
ment.

Further information regarding Nordea’s values is pre-

Control activities

Board of Directors’ report

sented in the section “Strategy — the future relationship bank
developing” on page 10.

A clear and transparent organisational structure is of
importance for the control environment. Nordea’s business
structure aims to support the overall strategy, with strong
business momentum and increased requirements on capital
and liquidity. The business and the organisation are under
continuous development. Further information on the rela-
tionship strategy is presented on page 10.

The key principle of risk management at Nordea is the
three lines of defence, with the first being the business
organisation and Group Functions, the second being the
centralised risk group functions, which define a common set
of standards, and the third being the internal audit function.
The Accounting Key Control (AKC) function, implements a
Nordea Group-wide system of key controls. This is done to
ensure that controls essential to the financial reporting are
continuously identified, monitored and assessed in the
Group.

Risk Assessment

The Board of Directors bears ultimate responsibility for
limiting and monitoring the Nordea Group's risk exposure,
and risk management is considered to be an integral part of
running the business. The main responsibility for perform-
ing risk assessments regarding financial reporting risks lies
with the business organisation. Performing risk assess-
ments close to the business increases the possibility of iden-
tifying the most relevant risks. In order to govern the qual-
ity, central functions stipulate in governing documents
when and how these assessments are to be performed.
Examples of risk assessments, performed at least annually,
are Quality and Risk Analysis for changes and Risk and
Control Self-Assessments at divisional levels.

Control Activities

The heads of the respective units are primarily responsible
for managing the risks, associated with the units’ opera-
tions and financial reporting processes. This responsibility

is primarily supported by the Group Accounting Manual
(GAM), the Financial Control Principles and various gov-
erning bodies, such as the Group Valuation Committee.
The GAM includes a standard reporting package used by
all entities to ensure consistent use of Nordea’s principles
and coordinated financial reporting. Fundamental internal
control principles at Nordea are the segregation of duties
and the four-eyes principle when approving, for instance,
transactions and authorisations.

The quality assurance vested in the management report-
ing process, where a detailed analysis of the financial out-
come is performed, constitutes one of the most important
control mechanisms associated with the reporting process.
The reconciliations constitute another set of important
controls in which Nordea works continuously to further
strengthen the quality.

Information & Communication

Group Functions are responsible for ensuring that the
Group Accounting Manual and the Financial Control Prin-
ciples are up-to-date and that changes are communicated
with the responsible units. These governing documents
are broken down into instructions and standard operating
procedures in the responsible units. On an annual basis,
accounting specialists from Group Finance provide ses-
sions for accountants and controllers in order to inform
about existing and updated rules and regulations with an
impact on Nordea.

Organisational
Objectives.

Nordea Annual Report 2014

Matters having impact on the fulfilment of financial
reporting objectives are communicated with external par-
ties, with Nordea actively participating in relevant national
forums, for example forums established by the Financial
Supervisory Authorities, Central Banks and associations
for financial institutions.

Monitoring

Nordea has established a process with the purpose of
ensuring proper monitoring of the quality of the financial
reporting and follow-up regarding possible deficiencies.

This interactive process aims to cover all COSO-compo-
nents in the Framework and is illustrated with the diagram
below.

The Risk and Control Self-Assessment process includes
monitoring the quality of internal control for financial
reporting. The assessment is presented in the annual
Operational and Compliance Risk Map, which is submit-
ted to Group Executive Management, the Board Audit
Committee, the Board Risk Committee and the Board of
Directors.

The Board of Directors, the Board Audit Committee, the
Board Risk Committee and Group Internal Audit have
important roles with respect to monitoring the internal
control of financial reporting at Nordea Group. For further
information, see “The work of the Board of Directors (3)”,
“Board Audit Committee (4)”, “Board Risk Committee (5)”
and “Group Internal Audit (8)” above.

Remuneration

Nordea has clear remuneration policy,
instructions and processes, securing sound
remuneration structures throughout the
organisation.

The Board of Directors decides on the Nordea Remunera-
tion Policy, based on an analysis of the possible risks
involved, and ensures that it is applied and followed-up as
proposed by the Board Remuneration Committee (BRC).

The Nordea Remuneration Policy will

¢ Support Nordea’s ability to recruit, develop and retain
highly motivated, competent and performance-oriented
employees and hence the People strategy.

¢ Supplement excellent leadership and challenging tasks as
driving forces for creating high commitment among
employees and a Great Nordea.

¢ Ensure that compensation at Nordea is aligned with
efficient risk management and the Nordea values: Great
customer experiences, It’s all about people and One
Nordea team.

Nordea offers competitive, but not market-leading com-
pensation packages.

Nordea has a total remuneration approach to compensa-
tion that recognises the importance of well-balanced but
varied remuneration structures based on business and
local market needs, and of compensation being consistent
with and promoting sound and effective risk manage-
ment, and not encouraging excessive risk-taking or coun-
teracting Nordea’s long-term interests.

Nordea remuneration components - purpose and
eligibility

Fixed Salary remunerates employees for full satisfactory
performance. The individual salary is based on three cor-
nerstones: Job complexity and responsibility, performance
and local market conditions.

Profit Sharing aims to stimulate value creation for cus-
tomers and shareholders and is offered to all employees.
The performance criteria for the 2014 programme are Risk
adjusted Return on Capital at Risk (RaRoCaR) and Cus-
tomer Satisfaction Index (CSI).

Variable Salary Part (VSP) is offered to selected manag-
ers and specialists to reward strong performance. Individ-
ual performance is assessed based on a predetermined set
of well-defined financial and non-financial success crite-
ria, including Nordea Group criteria.

Board of Directors’ report

Bonus scheme is offered only to selected groups of
employees in specific businesses areas or units. The aim is
to ensure strong performance and to maintain cost flexi-
bility for Nordea. Assessment of individual performance
shall be based on a predetermined set of well-defined
financial and non-financial success criteria, including Nor-
dea Group criteria.

One Time Payment (OTP) can be granted to employees in
the event of extraordinary performance that exceeds
requirements or expectations, or in connection with tem-
porary project work.

Pension and Insurance schemes aim at ensuring an
appropriate standard of living after retirement and personal
insurance during employment. Pension and insurance pro-
visions are according to local laws, regulations and market
practice and take the form either of determined public col-
lective agreements, company-determined schemes or a
combination thereof. Nordea aims to have defined contribu-
tion pension schemes.

Benefits at Nordea are granted as a means to stimulate
performance and well-being. Benefits are either linked to
the employment contract or local conditions.

Executive Incentive Programme (EIP) may be offered to
recruit, motivate and retain selected managers and key
employees, and aims to reward strong performance and
efforts. EIP contains predefined financial and non-finan-
cial performance criteria at Group, BA/GF/Division and
Unit/individual level. The Group performance criteria for
EIP 2014 are Nordea’s internal version of ROE being Risk-
Adjusted Return On Capital At Risk (RAROCAR), Operat-
ing Profit, Total costs and Customer Satisfaction Index
(CSD).

Further information regarding Profit Sharing, VSP,
Bonus schemes and EIP is provided below in this section.

Risk analysis

Nordea’s remuneration components are evaluated annu-
ally to ensure compliance with both international and local
remuneration guidelines. In addition to the evaluation of
Nordea’s remuneration components, the risk analysis
addressing issues arising with respect to Nordea’s Remu-
neration Policy was updated in March 2014. Key factors
addressed include risks related to the governance and
structure of the remuneration schemes, target-setting and
measurement of results, as well as fraud and reputation.
The main focus of the analysis is the variable components
that potentially lead to total compensation that could be
considered high.

Nordea mitigates these risks by regularly reviewing the
structure of the remuneration components, including the
participants and potential payout amounts, and by disclos-
ing relevant information to the public. Furthermore, Nor-

Nordea Annual Report 2014

55

56

dea has established clear processes for target-setting,
aligned with the Group’s strategy, and predefined growth
and development initiatives. The measurement of results is
aligned with Nordea’s overall performance measurement,
and payout decisions are subject to separate processes and
the Grandparent principle (approval by the manager’s
manager). Nordea also mitigates relevant risks by means of
its internal control framework, which is based on the con-
trol environment and includes the following elements: Val-
ues and management culture, goal orientation and follow-
up, a clear and transparent organisational structure,
separation of duties, the four-eye principle, quality and
efficiency of internal communication and an independent
evaluation process.

Performance-related compensation for 2014 for employ-
ees in the risk analysis defined as Identified Staff will be
partially deferred in 2015 to comply with international
guidelines and national regulations. Amounts deferred
and details about the deferrals will be published on
nordea.com one week before the ordinary Annual General
Meeting on 19 March 2015.

Audit of the remuneration policy

At least annually, the BRC follows up on the application of
the Nordea Remuneration Policy and supplementary
instructions with an independent review by Group Inter-
nal Audit.

Remuneration for the Board of Directors

The AGM annually decides on remuneration for the Board
of Directors. Further information is found in Note G7 on
page 97.

Remuneration for the CEO and Group Executive
Management (GEM)

The Board of Directors prepares the proposal for guide-
lines for remuneration for executive officers to be approved
by the AGM annually. According to these guidelines, the
Board of Directors has decided on the actual remuneration
for the CEO and members of GEM following a proposal
from the BRC. More information regarding the BRC is
found in the separate section “Corporate Governance
Report 2014”, page 48.

The external auditors presented a report to the AGM
2014 stating that, in 2013, the Board of Directors and the
CEO complied with the guidelines for remuneration for
executive officers as adopted by the AGM 2012 and 2013.

Further information about remuneration is found in
Note G7 on page 97.

Approved guidelines for remuneration for executive
officers for 2014
The AGM 2014 approved the following guidelines for
remuneration for executive officers.

“Nordea shall maintain remuneration levels and other
employment conditions needed to recruit and retain execu-

Nordea Annual Report 2014

tive officers with competence and capacity to deliver on
the strategy and targets thus enabling Nordea to become a
Great European bank.

The term “executive officers” shall in this context mean
the CEO of Nordea Bank AB (publ) and the executives
reporting directly to him, who are also members of Group
Executive Management.

Remuneration for executive officers will be decided by
the Board of Directors in accordance with Nordea’s inter-
nal policies and procedures, which are based on the Swed-
ish Financial Supervisory Authority’s (“SFSA”) regulations
on remuneration systems, national implementation of the
EU's directive on capital requirements for banks as well as
international sound compensation practices.

Salaries and other remuneration in line with market lev-
els constitute the overriding principle for compensation for
executive officers at Nordea. Compensation for the execu-
tive officers shall be consistent with and promote sound
and effective risk management and not encourage exces-
sive risk-taking or counteract Nordea’s long term interests.

Annual remuneration consists of fixed salary and varia-
ble salary.

Variable salary to the executive officers will be offered as
an Executive Incentive Programme 2014 (“GEM EIP 2014”)
to reward performance that meets predetermined targets
at Group, business area/group function and individual
level. The effect on the long term result is to be considered
when determining the targets. The outcome from GEM
EIP 2014 will be paid over a five-year period in cash and be
subject to forfeiture clauses, Total Shareholder Return
indexation and retention based on the SFSA’s regulations
on remuneration systems, taking account of domestic rules
and practices where relevant. GEM EIP 2014 has a one year
performance period and the outcome shall not exceed the
fixed salary. The executive officers were offered a similar
programme year 2013 (GEM EIP 2013). In accordance with
SFSA’s remuneration regulations guaranteed variable sal-
ary is to be exceptional and may only occur in the context
of hiring a new executive officer and then be limited to the
first year of employment.

Non-monetary benefits are given as a means to facilitate
executive officers’ performance. The levels of these bene-
fits are determined by what is considered fair in relation to
general market practice.

The executive officers shall be offered retirement bene-
fits in accordance with market practice in the country of
which they are permanent residents. Fixed salary during
the period of notice and severance pay shall in total not
exceed 24 months of fixed salary for executive officers.

The Board of Directors may deviate from these guide-
lines if there are special reasons for this in a certain case.”

Additional information about variable compensation
Profit Sharing scheme

The Profit Sharing scheme is capped and not based on the
value of the Nordea share. It is a benefit through which
employees receive a share of the profit to encourage sound
performance and one Nordea team which, in turn, will
lead to better profitability and make working for the Nor-
dea Group more attractive.

In 2014, a total of EUR 80m was provided for under Nor-
dea’s Profit Sharing scheme for all employees. For 2014,
each employee can receive a maximum of EUR 3,200, of
which EUR 2,600 is based on a pre-determined level of
Risk adjusted Return on Capital at Risk (RaRoCaR) and
EUR 600 is based on the level of customer satisfaction. If
all performance criteria were met, the cost of the scheme
would have amounted to a maximum of approx. EUR 88m.

Variable Salary Part (VSP)

VSP may be offered to selected managers and specialists to
reward strong performance and as means to recruit, moti-
vate and retain strongly performing employees at the Nor-
dea Group. VSP must be transparent and have predefined
success criteria with clear weightings. A VSP must include
financial and non-financial success criteria based on Nor-
dea Group KPIs decided annually by CEO. In the event of
weak or negative overall results for the Nordea Group, VSP
outcomes can be adjusted downwards at the discretion of
the CEO.

A VSP agreement does not exceed a maximum outcome
of 25% of annual fixed salary, except for few managers and
key specialists within specific areas, where the amount can
be a maximum of 50% of annual fixed salary. The respon-
sible GEM member may, in extraordinary cases, approve a
VSP agreement up to 100% of annual fixed salary.

Nordea adheres to the Grandparent principle when.
enrolling employees to any VSP scheme and approving the
outcome. Nordea has introduced deferral programmes for
the staff in the risk analysis defined as Identified Staff.

Bonus schemes

Bonus schemes are only offered to selected groups of
employees in specific business areas or units approved by
the Board of Directors. Nordea pays bonuses linked to per-
formance, with both divisional bonus pools and individual
allocations being explicitly based on defined performance
measures. Divisional financial performance is measured as
risk-adjusted profits, explicitly incorporating capital and
funding costs, and is adjusted for multi-period revenue
effects and minimum required profit. In the event of weak
or negative overall results for the Nordea Group, bonus
pools can be adjusted downwards at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. As such, individual compensation is
determined based on detailed performance evaluations
covering a range of financial and non-financial factors.

Inappropriate individual bonuses are prevented through
both caps on the percentage of risk-adjusted profit that can
be paid out, as well as individual caps. Nordea has intro-
duced deferral programmes for the staff in the risk analy-
sis defined as Identified Staff.

Care is taken to ensure that control and compliance staff
employed in divisions with bonus schemes are competi-
tively rewarded although not eligible for bonus.

The Board of Directors decides on new or revised bonus
schemes and the outcome of divisional bonus pools by
proposal from BRC. GEM is responsible for the implemen-
tation of the agreed bonus schemes. Nordea also applies a
stringent process to ensure that compensation for individ-
uals does not encourage excessive risk-taking behaviour.
To supplement the division-level assessment, there is an
approval process for significant bonuses for individuals.

Nordea Annual Report 2014

Executive Incentive Programme

In 2013, Nordea introduced Executive Incentive Programme
2013 (“EIP 2013”) which aims to strengthen Nordea’s capabil-
ity of retaining and recruiting the best talents. Furthermore,
the aim is to stimulate the managers and key employees
whose efforts have a direct impact on Nordea’s result, profit-
ability and long-term value growth. In 2014, Nordea offered
an EIP 2014 with similar aims and structure as EIP 2013.

EIP rewards performance that meets agreed predeter-
mined targets at Group, business areas, group functions,
divisions as well as business unit and individual level. The
effect on the long-term result is to be considered when deter-
mining the targets. EIP shall not exceed the fixed salary.

EIP shall be paid in the form of cash and be subject to
TSR-indexation, deferral, forfeiture clauses and retention
as per relevant remuneration regulations. The main part of
EIP 2014 is paid no earlier than October 2018.

Participation in the programme was offered to up to 400
managers and key employees, at the Nordea Group, except
GEM, who is offered a similar programme named GEM
EIP 2014. Since 2013, EIP has been offered instead of Nor-
dea’s LTIP and VSP for the invited employees and mem-
bers of GEM.

Long-Term Incentive Programmes
Nordea offered Long-Term Incentive Programmes (LTIP)
years 2007-2012, while the Board of Directors did not pro-
pose a LTIP to the AGM 2013 or AGM 2014 and has
decided not to propose a LTIP to the AGM 2015.

More information on Nordea’s LTIPs is presented in
Note G7 and on www.nordea.com, as well as in the
Annual Reports of previous years.
