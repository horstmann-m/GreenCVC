6.1.1 Management report

Revenues fell by 6.4% on a reported basis to €69.9 billion (down by
8.8% on an organic basis) compared with 2014. This decrease is mainly
attributable to lower commodity prices, a decline in LNG activities,
outages at the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear power plants, and the
shutdown of the Doel 1 reactor in Belgium, partially offset by the
appreciation of the US dollar against the euro and by more favorable
climatic conditions in France despite very mild temperatures towards the
end of 2015 (2014 had been a particularly warm year)

EBITDA" amounted to €11.3 billion, down 7.2% on a reported basis
and down 9.1% on an organic basis. It was affected by the same
factors as revenues, and also offset by the commissioning of new assets
and by continued cost performance efforts.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method" declined by 11.6% on a
reported basis and by 13.8% on an organic basis, to €6.3 billion. This
fall was in line with the EBITDA performance.

Net income/(loss) Group share" represented a net loss of €4.6 billion,
negatively impacted by €8.7 billion in impairment losses, and down
€7.1 billion on 2014 which had been boosted by gains on remeasuring
the interest in Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) following the acquisition
of control over the company and the loss of significant influence over the
Walloon inter-municipal companies.

Net recurring income Group share” amounted to €2.6 billion, down
€0.1 billion on 2014. The decline in current operating income after share
in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method was.
partially offset by lower tax expense and recurring financial expenses.

Cash flow from operations amounted to €9.8 billion, up €1.9 billion
year-on-year. This increase is notably due to the favorable change in
working capital requirements which had been affected in 2014 by the
one-off impact of commodity price fluctuations on margin calls, and by
lower interest payments owing to the decrease in the average cost of
debt, partially offset by the fall in cash generated from operations before
income tax and working capital requirements, in line with EBITDA
trends.

Net debt stood at €27.7 billion at December 31, 2015, up €0.2 billion
compared with net debt at December 31, 2014, reflecting (i) net
investments (including changes in the scope of consolidation) carried out
by the Group (€5.7 billion), dividends paid to ENGIE SA shareholders.
(€2.4 billion) and to non-controlling interests (€0.5 billion), the impact of
changes in exchange rates related to the depreciation of the euro
against major currencies (€0.5 billion), cash outflows related to tax
payments (€1.7 billion) and to interest payments on net debt
(€0.8 billion), (li) offset by cash generated from operations before income
tax and working capital requirements (€10.9 billion) and the favorable
change in working capital requirements (€1.2 billion).

(1) Comparative data at December 31, 2014 have been restated due to the retrospective application of IFRIC 21 (see Note 1.1.1 to the consolidated

financial statements).

(2) As an agreement was entered into on November 30, 2015 between the Belgian State, ENGIE and Electrabel, the expense relating to the nuclear
contribution was reclassified to recurring income (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).

the full consolidation of GTT by Global Gas & LNG (positive €35 million
impact) at the end of February 2014.

Exchange rates had a positive €1,969 million impact on Group
revenues, mainly reflecting the depreciation of the euro against the US
dollar, the pound sterling and the Thai baht. This was partly offset by the
euro's appreciation against the Brazilian real and Norwegian krone.

Organic revenue performance varied across the Group's business lines:
Infrastructures reported growth for the period, while revenues decreased
slightly at Energy International and Energy Services and fell sharply at
Energy Europe and Global Gas & LNG.

EBITDA declined by 7.2% to €11.3 billion over the period. Excluding the
impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and exchange rates,
the decrease in EBITDA came out at 9.19%:

6.1 Management report

Departures from the scope of consolidation had a negative €112 million
impact on EBITDA, largely due to disposals and deconsolidation of
power generation assets in France, Italy, and Central America, and to
the disposal of exploration-production assets. Conversely, additions to
the scope of consolidation had a positive €64 million impact, resulting
chiefly from acquisitions made by Energy Services.

Changes in exchange rates had a positive €299 million impact, mainly
due to the depreciation of the euro against the US dollar, the pound
sterling and the Thai baht, partially offset by the fall in the value of the
Brazilian real and Norwegian krone.

On an organic basis, EBITDA was down 9.1%, or €1,123 million, and
down 10.8%, or €1,373 million, when adjusted for climatic conditions in
France. Besides the positive impact of Perform 2015 and the swift
action plans in all business lines, this reflects the following trends:

= EBITDA for the Energy International business line amounted to
€3,589 million, down 6.8% on an organic basis. This was driven
mainly by (i) a weaker performance from power generation activities in
mature markets (United States, Australia and United Kingdom) and
from LNG operations, and (ii) planned maintenance in Thailand.
However, the decline was partly mitigated by improved performances,
mainly in Brazil despite unfavorable hydrological conditions, in Peru,
and in the Australian retail business;

= EBITDA for Energy Europe totaled €1,612 million, down 18.6% on an
organic basis, due mainly to outages at the Doel 3 and Tihange 2
nuclear power plants and the shutdown of the Doel 1 reactor, the
decrease in average electricity market prices and the adverse impact
of market conditions on LNG sales, despite the positive impact of
supply contract renegociations, more favorable climatic conditions for
gas sales in France and liquidated damages for delay collected in
connection with two coal-fired power plant projects in Germany and
the Netherlands;

= EBITDA for Global Gas & LNG was down 30.5% on an organic basis
to €1,625 million, reflecting plummeting oil prices, gas prices on the
European and Asian markets and a contraction in the LNG activity,
largely attributable to the disruption of LNG shipments from Yemen
since April 2015. These effects were partially offset by the increase in
production recorded by the exploration-production activities as a
result of the commissioning of new assets in 2014;

= EBITDA for the Infrastructures business line improved 3.9% on an
organic basis compared with the same prior-year period, to
€3,402 million, reflecting colder temperatures in 2015 and rate
increases, partially offset by a downturn in volumes and the related
revenues from Joint Transport Storage (JTS) services and gas
purchases and sales to maintain technical storage performance;

= EBITDA for Energy Services was up 3.9% on an organic basis to
€1,227 million.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method amounted to €6.3 billion, down
13.8% on an organic basis compared with 2014. This indicator shows
trends by business line comparable to those of EBITDA.

(1) The Energy International business line also has a “headquarters” function, the costs for which are not broken down in the table above.

Energy International’s revenues, at €14,534 million, rose by 4.0% on a
reported basis (down 3.8% on an organic basis). These movements
reflect, on the one hand, the negative €216 million impact of changes in
the scope of consolidation and the favorable €1,354 million impact of
changes in exchange rates (due mainly to the appreciation of the US.
dollar, but also the pound sterling and Thai baht), and on the other
hand, an organic decrease resulting chiefly from the impact of lower
prices and volumes of power generation activities in the mature markets.
and in Turkey, partially offset by improvements in the US and Australian
retail businesses and the commissioning of assets in Latin America and
South Asia, Middle East & Africa (SAMEA).

EBITDA amounted to €3,589 million, down 3.4% based on reported
figures and 6.8% on an organic basis after taking into account the
negative €160 million impact of changes in the scope of consolidation
and favorable exchange rate movements of €294 million. This organic
decrease was driven mainly by (i) a weaker performance from power
generation activities in mature markets (United States, Australia and
United Kingdom) and from LNG operations, and _ (ii) planned
maintenance in Thailand. However, the decline was partly mitigated by
improved performances, mainly in Brazil despite more unfavorable
hydrological conditions, in Peru, and in the Australian retail business.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method, at €2,596 million, decreased
by 5.4% on a reported basis and by 7.9% on an organic basis, in line
with EBITDA trends.

Latin America

Revenues for the Latin America region totaled €3,683 million,
representing a 3.5% decrease on a reported basis and a 3.5% organic
increase, reflecting the negative foreign exchange impact (the sharp
depreciation of the Brazilian real was partly offset by the appreciation of
the US dollar) combined with the impact of the disposal of all assets in
Central America in December 2014.

In Brazil, higher sales resulted from the increase in average sales prices,
primarily due to inflation indexation, and the progressive commissioning
of the Jirau Hydro complex. Peru trended upwards thanks to new PPAs
mainly related to the Quitaracsa Hydro Power Plant (commissioned in
October 2015), while in Chile, revenues contracted slightly mostly due to.
lower tariffs linked to fuel price indexation. Electricity sales remained
stable at 56.1 TWh, while gas sales rose by 0.3 TWh to 9.8 TWh.

6.1 Management report

EBITDA totaled €1,439 million, representing an organic increase of
12.3%, mainly reflecting:

= a stronger performance in Brazil despite more adverse hydrological
conditions affecting the overall system. For Tractebel Energia, this
improvement was attributable to an increase in the average price of
bilateral contracts, mainly due to inflation, combined with positive
results in the spot market. In addition, EBITDA benefited from the
commissioning of the Jirau Hydro complex;

= positive trends in Peru, mainly due to higher electricity sales thanks to
new contracts, primarily related to the Quitaracsa Hydro power plant;
and

= improved results in E-CL: a lower tariff due to the fuel price indexation
was more than offset by a lower cost base following the depreciation
of the local currency.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method amounted to €1,084 million, up.
16.1% on an organic basis primarily due to improved EBITDA.

Asia-Pacific

Revenues for the region totaled €2,684 million, down 2.0% based on
reported figures and 10.6% on an organic basis. There was a decline in
the Glow IPP business in Thailand due to planned maintenance and
lower demand. The Australian coal-fired power plants suffered from
lower market prices, especially in the first half of the year due to the
repeal of the carbon scheme on July 1, 2014. However, this was
partially offset by the growth of revenues in the Australian retail business,
reflecting an increase in the number of customers and_ higher
consumption due to the cold winter.

Electricity sales decreased by 1.5TWh to 41.3TWh, with higher
volumes in Australia (up 1.0 TWh) only partially offsetting the 2.5 TWh
decrease in Thailand. Natural gas sales rose by 0.6 TWh to 4.3 TWh.

EBITDA came in at €803 million, down 6.2% on a reported basis and
down 15.3% based on organic figures, mainly reflecting the weaker
performance of the Australian thermal facilities, which suffered because
of difficult market conditions, and the lower availability of the Gheco One
and Glow IPP facilities in Thailand due to major planned maintenance
outages, as well as the negative impact of persistently low oil prices on
gas distribution margins. This was partly offset by the strong
performance of Indonesian thermal assets and the growth of the
Australian retail business.

Current operating income after share of net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method turned out at €585 million
decreasing by 18.1% on an organic basis, in line with overall EBITDA
trends.

North America

Revenues for the North America region totaled €4,450 million, up 17.6%
on a reported basis reflecting the weakening of the euro against the US.
dollar, but remained unchanged organically. The organic stability
resulted from a combination of higher third-party LNG sales volumes,
US retail volumes at higher prices, and higher generation volumes which
offset lower electricity and gas prices.

Electricity sales increased 7.1 TWh to 72.0 TWh, reflecting higher sales
volumes across the generation fleet and US retail business.

Natural gas sales, excluding intra-Group transactions, increased by
8.0 TWh to 39.7 TWh following a combination of higher third-party LNG
sales and higher gas distribution in Mexico.

EBITDA came in at €751 million, down 23.0% on an organic basis. This
resulted from a combination of lower margins on LNG cargoes and
one-off items (either adverse this year and favorable last year). These
factors were partially mitigated by higher capacity revenues in the United
States and commissioning effects in Mexico. EBITDA decreased by
21.5% on a reported basis, impacted by the transfer of operations for
the Yemen LNG contract to the Global Gas & LNG business line.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method amounted to €437 million,
down 33.5% organically, primarily as a result of EBITDA movements.

United Kingdom & Turkey

Revenues for the United Kingdom & Turkey region totaled
€2,872 million, down 2.9% on a reported basis, and down 13.1% on an
organic basis. Lower power prices led to lower generation volumes.
across the UK and Turkey fleet. In the UK retail business, revenues were
down following lower gas prices and electricity sales volumes. These
adverse effects were slightly offset by higher gas sales volumes in
Turkey.

Electricity sales fell 4.0 TWh to 26.1 TWh, mainly due to lower volumes
across the UK thermal assets as a result of weaker market spreads. Gas.
sales totaled 42.1 TWh, up 7.0 TWh following higher transportation
volumes in Turkey.

EBITDA came in at €341 million, down 17.5% on an organic basis.
Weaker performances in the UK generation facilities resulting from
declining spreads were mitigated by favorable results in Turkey and cost
reduction initiatives. Additionally, 2015 benefited from the impact of
favorable one-off items.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method was €259 million, down 12.9%
on an organic basis, due primarily to the decrease in EBITDA but
mitigated slightly by lower depreciation charges following asset
writedowns in December 2014.

South Asia, Middle East & Africa

Revenues for the South Asia, Middle East & Africa region (SAMEA)
totaled €846 million, an increase of 24.5% on a reported basis reflecting
the weakening euro against the US dollar, and 5.6% on an organic
basis. This organic growth is mainly related to the commissioning of
Uch II in Pakistan in April 2014 as well as higher volumes and prices in
Meenakshi Phase | in India.

Electricity sales amounted to 8.5 TWh down 0.2 TWh on the previous
year, mainly reflecting the lower production levels of the Al Kamil power

Meenakshi Phase |.

EBITDA came in at €371 million, up 5.6% on an organic basis. This
increase stems mainly from the commissioning of Uch II and Tarfaya, the
improved performance of Meenakshi Phase |, as well as higher O&M
margins in the Middle East.

Current operating income after share of net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method amounted to €355 million, up.
4.9% on an organic basis. This increase is explained by the same
factors that impacted EBITDA.

Energy Europe’s revenues totaled €32,011 million, down 9.0% on a
reported basis, or 8.8% on an organic basis. This decrease chiefly
reflects the impact of the shutdown of three nuclear power plants in
Belgium (Doel 3 from March 26, 2014 to December 21, 2015, Tihange 2
from March 26, 2014 to December 14, 2015 and Doel1 from
February 15, 2015 to December 30, 2015), as well as the fall in gas
sales volumes, particularly in France and Italy, partially offset by the
positive impact of climatic conditions in France (2015 was colder than
2014). Gas sales represented 485.2 TWh, including 54.1 TWh to key
accounts. Electricity sales amounted to 165.4TWh. At
December 31, 2015, Energy Europe had over 12.7 million individual gas
customers and almost 6.1 million electricity customers.

The business line's EBITDA dropped 20.0% on a reported basis to
€1,612 million (down 18.6% on an organic basis). 2015 was penalized
by outages at the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear power plants and by the
shutdown of the Doel 1 reactor, the fall in average sales prices on the
electricity market and the unfavorable impact of market conditions on
LNG sales. These factors were partly mitigated by more favorable
climatic conditions for gas sales in France, the positive impact of supply
contract renegociations and by liquidated damages for delay collected in
connection with two coal-fired power plant projects in Germany and the
Netherlands.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method also fell, reflecting the decline in
EBITDA despite lower depreciation and amortization charges.

Central Western Europe (CWE)

The contribution of CWE to Group revenues amounted to
€26,859 million, down 8.3% on a reported basis and 8.1% on an
organic basis. The decrease chiefly reflects the shutdown of three
nuclear power plants in Belgium, and the decline in gas sales volumes in
France.

CWE's EBITDA was down 4.1% on a reported basis to €1,536 million,
due chiefly to the factors affecting revenues discussed above. The
decline was partially offset by improved gas supply conditions for the
Group and by favorable climatic conditions in France.

However, current operating income after share in net income of
entities accounted for using the equity method increased (up 3.8% on
a reported basis to €718 million), due to lower depreciation and
amortization charges in Belgium, Luxembourg and France.

France's contribution to Group revenues for 2015 amounted to
€12,494 million, down 8.8% on a reported basis (down 7.2% on an
organic basis) due to a negative volume impact on gas sales, mainly in
the B2B segment, and a negative price effect in both the B2C and B2B
segments. These negative impacts were partly countered by more
favorable climatic conditions in 2015 compared to 2014 and by the
increase in electricity sales to end customers.

Natural gas sales were down 29.4 TWh despite colder weather than in
2014 (+15.1 TWh), following the loss of customers due to competitive
pressure in the key accounts segment and the end of regulated tariffs
on the B2B market. ENGIE maintains a share of around 77% of the B2C
market and around 31% of the B2B market. Electricity sales were up on

volumes sold and the transfer of drawing rights on the Chooz B and
Tricastin nuclear reactors to CWE Benelux & Germany (negative

Revenues for the Benelux & Germany region amounted to
€9,620 million in 2015, down 3.5% on a reported basis and down 5.3%
on an organic basis compared to 2014. Volumes of electricity and gas
sales declined due to outages at the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear
power plants and the shutdown of the Doel 1 reactor, and to a drop in
sales to key accounts. These factors were partially offset by the transfer
of CWE France’s drawing rights on the Chooz B and Tricastin nuclear
reactors.

Electricity sales in Belgium and Luxembourg were down 9.7 TWh,
mainly reflecting a decrease in market sales. The retail market share in
Belgium remained stable at around 47% at end-December. Electricity
sales in the Netherlands and Germany were up 1.9 TWh and 1.2 TWh,
respectively.

SOUTHERN & EASTERN EUROPE

Financial information
6.1 Management report

Natural gas sales declined 11.1 TWh, or 12%, in the Benelux &

accounts. Retail market share in Belgium has stabilized at around 44%.

EBITDA for the region amounted to €611 million, up 22.9% on a
reported basis and 7.0% on an organic basis, chiefly reflecting liquidated
damages for delay collected in connection with two coal-fired power
plant projects in Germany and the Netherlands. Nonetheless, EBITDA
was penalized by outages at the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear power

OF ENTITIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

Global Gas & LNG's contribution to Group revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2015 amounted to €4,246 million, down 38.3% on a
reported basis compared to 2014 and down 42.0% on an organic basis.

The decrease in the revenue contribution was mainly due to plummeting
oil prices, gas prices on the European and Asian markets, which sharply
reduced LNG arbitrage opportunities in 2015, and also to the disruption
in supplies shipped from Egypt as from January 2015 and from Yemen
as from April 2015.

The unfavorable price impact on exploration-production activities was
offset to a large extent by the 3.6 Mboe increase in total hydrocarbon

production (59.1 Mboe in 2015 compared to 55.5 Mboe in 2014),
thanks to the restart of production at the Njord facility in Norway in
July 2014 and to contributions from the Amstel field in the Netherlands
and the Gudrun field in Norway, commissioned in February 2014 and
April 2014, respectively.

External LNG sales fell 47.8 TWh to 71.4 TWh, representing 86 cargoes
for 2015 compared with 119.2 TWh, or 142 cargoes, for the prior-year
period, and were adversely impacted by the fall in LNG sales prices in
Europe and in Asia, where LNG sales prices are currently very close to
European prices based on comparable shipping costs.

30.5% on an organic basis compared to the same prior-year period,
due to the abovementioned reasons.

OF ENTITIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

Total revenues for the Infrastructures business line, including
intra-Group transactions, amounted to €6,608 million, down 3.0% on
2014, reflecting:

the decrease in gas purchases and sales at Storengy to maintain
technical storage performance (low summer/winter spreads) and the
related revenues at GRTgaz and Storengy, linked particularly to Joint
Transport Storage (JTS) services and market coupling (due to a very
low North-South GEP spread);

= despite:

= a 19.9 TWh" increase in volumes distributed by GRDF due to
colder weather conditions in 2015 compared to the prior-year
period;

= the annual review in France of distribution infrastructure access
tariffs (3.9% increase on July 1, 2015 and 4.1% increase on
July 1, 2014) and of transport infrastructure tariffs (2.5%
increase on April 1, 2015 and 3.9% increase on April 1, 2014);

= improved marketing of storage capacity in France linked to the
commissioning of new storage caverns in Germany
(Peckensen 4 and 5) and the United Kingdom (Stublach).

In this climatic and regulatory context, the business line’s contribution to
Group revenues was €3,055 million, a slight 2.0% increase on 2014.
The improved contribution essentially reflects the development of third
party services in increasingly deregulated markets, despite the downturn
in gas purchases and sales activities at Storengy.

EBITDA for the Infrastructures business line amounted to €3,402 million
for the period, up 3.9% on the prior-year period thanks to favorable
climatic conditions (positive 19.9TWh impact) and rate increases,
partially offset by a decrease in volumes and revenues from JTS services
and performance gas purchases and sales.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities

OF ENTITIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

Revenues for the Energy Services business line, up 2.1% on a reported
basis to €16,001 million for 2015, buoyed by the acquisitions carried out
in the second half of 2014 of Lend Lease FM in the United Kingdom,
Ecova in the United States, Keppel FMO in Singapore, and Lahmeyer in
Germany, essentially offset by the disposal of oil trading operations in
Italy, for a net amount of €189 million, and positive exchange rate effects
in the United Kingdom (€148 million) and Switzerland (€59 million).

Revenue slipped 0.4% on an organic basis, mainly owing to a decline in
maintenance services in the North Sea oil and gas industry following the
collapse of crude oil prices, and to a downtum in the Services business.
in France and Southern Europe linked to the fall in investments by public
authorities and to continued lackluster business investment.

This decline was partially offset by an upturn in sales of heat by
networks and co-generation facilities triggered by the return to colder
temperatures in 2015 after exceptionally mild weather conditions in
2014, and by a good performance from Engineering activities.

EBITDA for the Energy Services business line rose 8.9% on a reported
basis to €1,227 million, due chiefly to the acquisitions referred to above.
Organic growth came out at 3.9%, essentially reflecting:

= new facilities commissioned in France.

These items were partially offset by:

Current operating income after share in net income of entities

Income/(loss) from operating activities represented a net loss of
€3,242 million in 2015. The year-on-year decline results chiefly from the
fall in current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method and the impact of impairment
losses recognized against goodwill, property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets and financial assets.

At December 31, 2015, the Group recognized impairment losses of
€2,628 million against goodwill, €5,731 million against property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets, and €402 million against financial
assets and investments in entities accounted for using the equity
method. These impairment losses mainly concerned the Global Gas &
LNG, Energy International and Energy Europe business lines. After
taking into account the deferred tax effects and the share of impairment
losses attributable to non-controlling interests, the impact of these
impairment losses on net income Group share for 2015 amounts to
€6,761 million. These impairment losses are described in Note 7.2
“Impairment losses” to the consolidated financial statements.

Impairment losses recognized in 2014 totaled €1,037 million, chiefly in
respect of GlobalGas & LNG (€362 million), Energy International
(€306 million) and Energy Europe (€291 million).

Income/(loss) from operating activities was also affected by:

= changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives (mark-to-market)
that had a negative impact of €261 million on income/(loss) from
operating activities (reflecting the impact of transactions not eligible
for hedge accounting), compared with a negative impact of
€298 million in 2014. The impact for the period results chiefly from
negative overall price effects on these positions, partly offset by the
net positive impact of unwinding positions with a negative market
value at December 31, 2014;

restructuring costs of €265 million (€167 million in 2014), including
€47 million in external costs relating to the change in the Group's
corporate brand;

= changes in the scope of consolidation (gains and losses on disposals
of consolidated equity investments or remeasurements of
previously-held interests in accordance with IFRS 3) which had a
negative impact of €46 million versus a positive impact of €562 million
in 2014 (relating mainly to gains on remeasuring the previously-held
interest in GTT after the Group acquired control of the company, and
on the Walloon intermunicipal companies due to the loss of significant
influence);

= other non-recurring items representing a loss of €248 million,
integrating additional dismantling and site rehabilitation costs for one
production unit versus income of €353 million in 2014 (primarily
resulting from the capital gain on the disposal of interests in the
Flemish inter-municipal companies).

The Group's net financial loss narrowed to €1,547 million in 2015 from
€1,876 million in 2014, owing to a €100 million fall in the cost of debt on
the back of the lower average cost of gross debt, and to the positive
€216 million impact of lower non-recurring expenses compared to 2014
(corresponding to changes in the fair value of derivatives not eligible for
hedge accounting which had a positive €104 million impact and debt
restructuring transactions which had a positive €99 million impact).

The 2015 income tax charge amounts to €324 million (versus
€1,586 million in 2014). It includes an income tax benefit of
€1,110 million arising on non-recurring income statement items (versus.
€659 million in 2014), essentially related to the impairment losses
recognized against property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
in 2015 and €338 million of deferred tax income in Luxembourg.
Adjusted for these items, the effective recurring tax rate was 39.0%,
lower than the 42.5% rate in 2014 due mainly to the impacts of one-off
reversals of various tax provisions and to the decrease in the nuclear
contribution.

Net income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests was down
year-on-year at a loss of €496 million, due primarily to impairment losses
impacting net income from exploration-production activities.

Total equity amounted to €48.8 billion, a decrease of €7.2 billion
compared to December 31, 2014. This decrease results essentially from
the net loss for the period (negative €5.1 billion impact), the payment of
cash dividends (negative €2.9 billion impact), and other comprehensive
income (positive €0.9 billion impact, chiefly translation adjustments,
actuarial differences and net investment and cash flow hedges net of

Provisions remained stable, as the fall in actuarial differences on
provisions for post-employment benefits (negative €0.4 billion impact),
and provisions for tax disputes in Australia and the United Kingdom
(negative €0.2 billion impact) was offset by the positive €0.6 billion
impact of unwinding the discount on provisions.

The Company posted a net operating loss of €744 milion versus a net benefit of €350 million and €368 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

operating loss of €1,354 million in 2014. This improved performance
chiefly reflects advances in electricity transmission partially offset by the
decline in the energy margin and the decrease in personnel costs.

Net income for the year came out at €268 million.

Shareholders’ equity amounted to €39,903 million at end-2015, versus.
€41,896 million at December 31, 2014, mainly reflecting the cash

cash equivalents totaled €9,158 million

The Company reported net financial income of €1,089 million compared
with €1,589 million one year earlier. This mainly includes dividends
received from subsidiaries for €2,055 million versus €2,297 million in
2014, and the cost of debt which remained stable at €837 million,
chiefly consisting of the interest expense on bond issues.

6.1.1.7. Outlook

The Group is committed to a 3 year transformation plan aiming at
creating value and at improving the Group's risk profile. This plan is
based on 3 main programs:

= a portfolio rotation program of €15 billion (net debt impact) over
2016-2018, aimed at reducing its exposure to activities sensitive to
commodity prices, by means of disposals, partnerships and/or sites
closures;

= a Capex program of €22 billion over 2016-2018, of which €7 billion
on maintenance and at least €500 million on innovation, mainly
financed by operational cash flow generation; and

= an ambitious performance program named Lean 2018, which
targets recurring savings on operational costs, with a cumulated net
impact on EBITDA of €1 billion by 2018.

Financial information
6.1 Management report

For 2016", and despite a difficult market context characterized by the
major and prolonged drop of oil, gas and power prices, which will
continue to weigh on its results, the Group anticipates a net recurring
income Group share resilient compared with 2015, comprised
between €2.4 and €2.7 billion. This guidance is based on an estimated
range for EBITDA”! of €10.8 to €11.4 billion, assuming no significant
scope out impact.

For the period 2016-2018, the Group anticipates:
= anet debt/EBITDA ratio below or equal to 2.5x; and
= an “A” category credit rating.

For fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Group confirms the payment of
€1/share dividend per year, payable in cash.

For fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the Group commits to pay a
€0.70/share dividend per year, payable in cash.

6.1.2 Cash and shareholders’ equity

6.1.2.1 Borrowing conditions and financial

structure applicable to the issuer

Debt structure

Gross debt (excluding bank overdrafts, amortized cost and financial
derivative instruments) amounted to €36.9 billion at December 31, 2015,
up slightly from the previous year, and was primarily made up of
€24 billion in bond issues and €7.1 billion in bank loans (including
finance leases). Other loans and drawdowns on credit lines accounted
for a total of €0.5 billion. Short-term loans (commercial paper)
accounted for 15% of this total gross debt at the end of 2015.

79% of the gross debt was issued on financial markets (bond issues and
commercial paper).

Net debt, excluding amortized costs, the effect of financial derivative
instruments and cash collateral, came to €27.5 billion at the end of
2015.

At the end of 2015, the net debt was 67% denominated in euros, 17%
in US dollars and 7% in British pounds, excluding amortized cost but
after the foreign exchange impact of derivatives.

After the impact of derivatives, 83% of the net debt was at a fixed rate.
The average cost of gross debt was 2.99%, down by 15 basis points
compared to 2014. The average maturity of net debt is 9.5 years at the
end of 2015.

Main transactions in 2015

The main transactions performed in 2015 affecting financial debt are
described in Note 15.3.2 of Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial
statements”. In addition, the Group renewed a €4.5 billion centralized
syndicated credit line ahead of schedule, taking the total to €5.5 billion
and extending its maturity to November 2020.

In 2015, the annual update of the prospectus for ENGIE’s €25 billion
EMTN program received approval No. 15-518 from the AMF, dated
October 8, 2015.

Ratings

Moody's and Standard & Poor's have put ENGIE's rating on review for
downgrade / negative credit watch respectively on 13 and 26 February
2016. ENGIE was rated A/A-1 by Standard & Poor's with stable outlook
since July 2014, and A1/P-1 negative outlook since June 2015 by
Moody's.

6.1.2.2 Restrictions on the use of capital

On December 31, 2015, the Group had total undrawn confirmed credit
lines (usable, among other things, as back-up lines for the commercial
paper programs) of €14.0 billion. 92% of these lines are centrally
managed and their availability is not subject to any financial covenant or
linked to a credit risk rating. The counterparties of these lines are well
diversified, with no single counterparty holding more than 6% of the total
of these pooled lines. No pooled credit facility was in use as at the end
of 2015.

Furthermore, the Group has set up credit lines in some subsidiaries, for
which the documentation includes ratios related to their financial
standing. These lines of credit are not guaranteed by ENGIE SA or GIE
ENGIE Alliance.

The definition, as well as the level of these ratios, also known as
“financial covenants”, are determined by agreement with the lenders and
may be reviewed during the life of the loan.

(2) As from January 1, 2016, EBITDA will no longer include the non-recurring contribution from entities accounted for using the equity method (which

represents in 2015 an amount of -€12 million).

expense) or for servicing interest (Interest Cover Ratio
= EBITDA ‘interest expense);

Free Cash Flows debt divided by the borrowed amount still owed);

At December 31, 2015, all Group companies whose debt is
consolidated were compliant with the covenants and representations
contained in their financial documentation, with the exception of an
Energy International subsidiary, which was not compliant with some of
its commitments. Appropriate waivers are currently under discussion.

6.1.2.3. Expected sources on financing to
honor commitments relative to
investment decisions

The Group believes that its funding needs will be covered by available
cash and the possible use of its existing credit facilities. However, it may
call upon the capital markets on an ad hoc basis.

If necessary, dedicated financing could be established for very specific
projects.

The Group has a total of €4.0 billion in credit lines or loans expiring in
2016 (excluding the maturity of €5.4 billion in commercial paper). In
addition, at December 31, 2015 it had €9.4 billion in cash (net of bank
overdrafts) and a total of €14.0 billion in available lines (not net of the
amount of commercial paper issued), including €1 billion expiring in
2016.
