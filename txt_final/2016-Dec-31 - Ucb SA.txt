2.2 | 2016 KEY EVENTS‘

There have been a number of key events that have
affected or will affect UCB financially:

IMPORTANT AGREEMENTS/INITIATIVES

UCB divested its nitrate business to selected parties:
In January 2016, UCB divested three cardiovascular
products from its established brand portfolio to Merus
Labs International Inc. (Canada). The transaction
relates to nitrate products sold in Europe and selected
markets and amounted to € 92 million. In May 2016,
UCB handed over its nitrate franchise in China to
Chinese company Jilin Yinglian Biopharmaceutical
and its financial partner PAG Asia. The transaction
amounted to € 60 million. In July 2016, UCB divested
the remaining nitrates business in Russia and Ukraine.

UCB entered into an agreement with Avara
Pharmaceuticals Services to divest UCB’s Shannon
manufacturing site in Ireland in February 2016.

UCB reduces its indebtedness:

In March 2016, UCB exercised its option to redeem
the € 300 million perpetual subordinated bonds.
The perpetual subordinated bonds were issued

in 2011 at 99.499% and offered investors a coupon
of 7.75% per annum during the first five years.

In December 2016, the € 500 million institutional
bond matured and was repaid. The senior unsecured
bonds were issued in December 2009 at 99.635%,
carrying a coupon of 5.75% p.a.

In July 2016, UCB out-licensed UCB6352 to Syndax
Pharmaceuticals to develop the antibody which is
expected to be tested in clinical trials in oncology.

The Delaware District Court confirmed the validity of
U.S. patent RE38,551 related to Vimpat® (lacosamide),
UCB’s anti-epileptic drug, in August 2016. The District
Court decision is currently under appeal before the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).

In November 2016, UCB divested venlafaxine ER, for
the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders and
marketed in the U.S., to Osmotica Pharmaceuticals
Corp. (Marietta, GA) amounting to € 102 million.

REGULATORY UPDATE AND
PIPELINE PROGRESS

NEUROLOGY

> Briviact® (brivaracetam) as adjunctive therapy for
partial-onset seizures in patients from 16 years of
age was approved in EU in January and in the U.S.
in February 2016 and received Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) scheduling in May 2016.
Briviact® is now available to patients with epilepsy in
the EU and in North America. In January, 2017, UCB

filed a supplemental New Drug Application to the

U.S. authorities for Briviact® as monotherapy in the
treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 16 years
of age and older with epilepsy.

In July 2016, the Japanese regulatory authorities
approved Vimpat® (lacosamide) as adjunctive therapy
in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adult
patients with epilepsy. In August, Vimpat® was filed

in Japan for the treatment of partial onset seizures

as monotherapy.

In August, Vimpat® was filed in the EU for partial onset
seizures (POS) add-on and monotherapy in children
(older than four years).

In December, the European Commission

approved a license extension for Vimpat® for use

as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset
seizures in adolescent (16-18 years) and adult patients
with epilepsy, following the filing in January 2016.

In February 2016, the Japanese regulatory authorities
approved E Keppra® (levetiracetam) as adjunctive
therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-
clonic seizures (PGTCS).

The Phase 2a study with UCB0942 — aimed at highly

drug resistant epilepsy patients, who failed four anti-

epileptic drugs and have at least four seizures/week —
showed positive top line results and will progress into
further development.

All other clinical development programs are continuing
as planned.

IMMUNOLOGY

In March 2016, UCB announced top-line results from
EXXELERATE, the first head-to-head superiority study
of two treatments in the anti-TNF class, comparing
Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) plus methotrexate
(MTX) to Humira® (adalimumab) plus MTX in adult
patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis
who are inadequate responders to MTX. The primary
endpoints for superiority were not met, as results
between Cimzia® and Humira® were numerically
comparable. This study was designed as a treatment
strategy trial in line with core principles of the treat-
to-target guidelines, which advocate evaluating
response early and ensuring a change in therapy

for patients not responding at three months.

In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has accepted UCB’s filing for a proposed new
indication for Cimzia® to treat juvenile idiopathic
arthritis (JIA). Also in August, UCB reported positive
topline results for RAPID-C, a Phase 3 study evaluating
Cimzia® in rheumatoid arthritis in China. In September,
the AutoClicks® prefilled pen was approved for the
European Union as a new administration option for
patients treated with Cimzia®.

* From 1 January 2016 up to the publication date of this report.

In October and December 2016, UCB and its partner
Dermira announced positive topline results from
CIMPASI-2 and CIMPASI-1, two Phase 3, multi-
center, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating
the efficacy and safety of Cimzia® in adult patients
with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
These studies were completed in January 2017,

with the announcement of positive topline results
from CIMPACT, a Phase 3, multi-center, placebo-
controlled and active-controlled clinical trial
evaluating the efficacy and safety of Cimzia®. The
submissions of marketing authorization applications
based on these three Phase 3 studies to regulatory
authorities are expected in the third quarter of 2017.
UCB continues to advance the science and expand
the availability of data bringing valuable information
to women with autoimmune diseases who are
planning to build a family. This includes two Phase 4
studies, CRADLE and CRIB, which recently completed
and provided positive results. During the fourth
quarter of 2016, UCB presented at various scientific
congresses the positive results from a multicenter
study evaluating the concentration of Cimzia® in
mature breast milk of lactating mothers (CRADLE).
In January 2017, the second study, a multicenter
study evaluating the transfer of Cimzia® from the
mother to the infant via the placenta (CRIB), provided
positive topline results. These results are planned
for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting.
These results strengthen previous data on women
treated with Cimzia® during pregnancy and the effect
on their newborn infants, and will be submitted to
regulatory authorities in Q2 2017.

In March 2016, UCB7665 started a Phase 2, proof-of-
concept (POC) study, in idiopathic thrombocytopenic
purpura (ITP); topline results are expected in Q3 2017.

In May 2016, seletalisib started a Phase 1b study in
activated PI3 kinase delta syndrome (APDS), a rare
cause of immunodeficiency. The Phase 2a study in
patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is
ongoing with first results expected at the end of 2017.

In June 2016, a Phase 1 study successfully completed
with UCB4144/VR942, an immunomodulatory inhaled
biologic for patients with uncontrolled asthma in
development partnership with Vectura. The generated
data package supports the continued development of
UCB4144/VR942 and progression to Phase 2 which is
expected in 2017.

In June 2016, the Phase 2b program started for
dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40L pegylated Fab
being developed in systemic lupus erythematosus
jointly with Biogen. The dose-ranging study aims to
enroll around 160 patients for 12 months. First results
are expected in H2 2018.

In June, positive results from a Phase 1b study in
patients with psoriatic arthritis (PSA) were presented at
EULAR (Annual European Congress of Rheumatology)
for bimekizumab, an investigational humanized

lgG1 monoclonal antibody rationally designed to
potently and selectively neutralize the biological
function of both IL-17A and IL-17F, two closely related
proinflammatory cytokines. Both IL-17A and IL-17F are
key drivers of chronic inflammation in many severe
skin and joint diseases.

UCB started the Phase 2b program for bimekizumab
in various indications: in psoriasis (August 2016 — with
first results expected in Q3 2017), in psoriatic arthritis
and in ankylosing spondylitis (October 2016 — both
with first results expected in Q3 2018).

In July, UCB7858 for potential treatment of auto-
inflammatory diseases entered Phase 1.

All other clinical development programs are continuing
as planned.

BONE

In February, UCB and Amgen announced positive top-
line results from a Phase 3 study evaluating Evenity™
(romosozumab) for the treatment of osteoporosis in
postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture
(FRAME), which met the co-primary endpoints of
reducing the incidence of new vertebral fracture
through months 12 and 24.

UCB and Amgen announced in March positive top-
line results from a Phase 3 study evaluating Evenity™
in men with osteoporosis (BRIDGE), which met the
primary endpoint of increasing bone mineral density
at the lumbar spine at 12 months.

In July, UCB and Amgen submitted the biologics
license application (BLA) for Evenity™ to the U.S.
authorities, which was accepted for review in
September. The New Drug Submission (NDS) for
Evenity™ was also submitted to Health Canada during
the second half of 2016.

In December, UCB and Amgen submitted an
application seeking marketing approval of Evenity™
for the treatment of osteoporosis for patients at high
risk of fracture for review to the Pharmaceuticals and
Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan. Evenity™ is
developed in collaboration with Amgen globally, as
well as with Astellas in Japan.

The current liabilities amounted to € 2 418 million,
down € 643 million, due to decrease of income

tax payables related to the sale of Kremers Urban

in 2015, and the repayment of short term borrowings
and bonds.

The net debt decreased by € 83 million from

€ 921 million as of end December 2015 to € 838 million
as per end December 2016, and mainly relates to

the underlying net profitability, the sale of non-core
assets and the repayment of the Lannett note offset

by the dividend payment on the 2015 results, the
repayment of the bonds, payment of taxes related to
the sale of Kremers Urban in 2015. The net debt to
recurring EBITDA ratio for 2016 reached 0.8 after 1.12
for 2015 and thus surpassed UCB mid-term target of 1:1
two years ahead of time.

2.13 | CASH FLOW STATEMENT

The evolution of cash flow generated by bio-
pharmaceuticals activities is affected by the following:

Cash flow from operating activities amounted to

€ 427 million, of which € 726 million from continuing
operations, compared to € 204 million in 2015.

The underlying net profitability and the improvement
of working capital is offset by the taxes paid related
to the sale of Kremers Urban.

Cash flow from investing activities showed an inflow
of € 317 million in 2016, of which € 133 million from
continuing operations, compared to € 19 million

in 2015. The divestment of non-core assets from

the established brand portfolio (mainly nitrates and
venlafaxine ER) generated € 273 million and Lannett
reimbursed the US$ 200 million outstanding senior
unsecured loan notes, offset by the investment

in tangible and intangible assets.

Cash flow from financing activities has an outflow
of € 1 267 million, which includes the dividend paid
to UCB shareholders and the shareholders of the
perpetual subordinated bond (€ 231 million), the
reimbursement of the perpetual subordinated bond
(€ 300 million) and the senior unsecured bond

(€ 500 million), the acquisition of treasury shares

(€ 49 million) and the repayment of short term
borrowings (€ 107 million).

2.14 | OUTLOOK 2017

For 2017, UCB expects the continued growth of its
core products driving company growth. UCB will also
advance its development pipeline to offer potential
new solutions for patients.

2017 revenue reporting is impacted by the product
divestitures in 2016 as well as IFRS 15, and is

expected to reach approximately € 4.25—4.35 billion.
Recurring EBITDA should increase to approximately

€ 1.15-1.2 billion. Core earnings per share are therefore
expected in the range of € 3.70-4.00 based on

an average of 188 million shares outstanding.

The figures for the outlook 2017 as mentioned above
are calculated on the same basis as the actual figures
for 2016 as mentioned earlier in this management
report as well as in the consolidated financial
statements as at 31 December 2016 and 2015 with
the exception of the following:

The assumptions taken for the outlook 2017
conservatively take into account the expected
restrained effect on revenue from the
implementation of IFRS 15;

Lower net sales of established brands due to
divestitures during 2016 (nitrates, venlafaxine ER).
