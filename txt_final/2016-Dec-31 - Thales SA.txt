In 2016, Thales recorded a high level of order intake, strong sales growth
and improved profitability in line with its medium-term objectives.

The Group exceeded all the financial objectives it had set for 2016: an
order intake of between €15.5 billion and €16.0 billion, organic sales
growth slightly above 5%, and an EBIT of between €1,300 million
and €1,330 million, based on February 2016 exchange rates

1.1.1.2 Presentation of financial
information

Accounting policies

Thales’ consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards} as approved by
the European Union at 31 December 2016.

These principles, described in Note 14 of the consolidated financial
statements, are consistent with those applied for the year ended

1 December 2015. In particular, the new mandatory standards
applicable as from 1 January 2016 (annual improvements for
2010-2012, then 2012-2014 cycles, amendments to IAS 16 and
IAS 38, amendments to IFRS 11 and amendments to IAS 19) have no
impact on the Group's financial statements

Definitions of non-GAAP financial indicators

In order to facilitate monitoring and benchmarking of its financial and
operating performance, the Group presents three key non-GAAP
indicators, which exclude non-operating and/or non-recurring items.
They are determined as follows

¢ EBIT, an adjusted operating indicator, corresponds to income from
operations plus the share in net income of equity-accounted
companies, before the impact of entries relating to the amortisation
of intangible assets acquired (purchase price allocation — PPA)
recorded as part of business combinations. From 1 January 2016,
it also excludes the other expenses recorded in income from
operations that are directly related to business combinations, which
are unusual by nature.

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

e Adjusted net income corresponds to net income, excluding the

following items and net of the corresponding tax effects:

= amortisation of acquired intangible assets (PPA) recorded as part
of business combinations,

= expenses recognised in income from operations, that are directly
related to business combinations, which are unusual by nature;

= gains and losses on disposals of assets, changes in scope of
consolidation and other,

= changes in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments
{recognised under "Other financial income and expenses” in the
consolidated financial statements),

= actuarial gains {losses) on long-term benefits (recognised under
“Finance costs on pensions and other long-term employee
benefits” in the consolidated financial statements);

© Free operating cash flow corresponds to the net cash flow from
operating activities before contributions to reduce the pension deficit
in the United Kingdom, and after deducting net operating investments.

Readers are reminded that only the consolidated financial statements at
31 December were audited by the statutory auditors, including the
calculation of EBIT, which is described in Note 2 “Segment Information"
to the consolidated financial statements, and free operating cash flow,
which is described in Note 11.1. Adjusted financial information other
than that provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
is subject to the verification procedures applicable to all information
included in this management report.

The impact of these adjustment entries on the profit and loss account for
2016 and 2015 is presented in the tables on pages 9 and 10
Calculation of free operating cash flow is outlined on page 11

In this management report, the amounts expressed in millions of euros
are rounded to the nearest million. As a result, the sums of the rounded
amounts may differ very slightly from the reported totals. All ratios and
changes are calculated based on underlying amounts, which feature in
the consolidated financial statements.

“Organic change" measures the movement in monetary indicators
excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates and scope of
consolidation. It is defined as the difference between (i) the indicator for
the prior period, recomputed at the exchange rates applicable for the

the contribution of entities divested during the current period, and (ii) the
value of the indicator for the current period less the contribution of
entities acquired during the current period

1.1.1.3 Order intake

2016 order intake amounted to €16,514 million, down 13% on 2015 (down 11% at constant scope and currency'''). The book-to-bill ratio was

1.11 for the year, compared to 1.34 in 2015

[o} Mature markets: Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand. Emerging markets: all other countries.

The order intake significantly outperformed sales for the third consecutive
year. Powered by this strong sales momentum, the consolidated
order book was €33.53 billion at 31 December 2016, an increase
of €9.06 billion over three years (from €24.47 billion at
31 December 2013)

Thales received 14 large orders with a unit value of over
€100 million, representing a total amount of €4,665 million

e One contract booked in QI] 2016, covering support for the
Watchkeeper unmanned aerial vehicle for the British army;

¢ Two contracts booked in Q2 2016: one covering the security of
170 Ministry of Defence locations in the Netherlands and the other
relating to the production of a military satellite for a Middle East
customer;

e Three contracts booked in Q3 2016:
= one relating to the order of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft by the Indian
government,
= one to provide satellite operator SES with a satellite specifically
designed for onboard internet connectivity (SES 17}, and

= in-flight entertainment systems (IFE) for Emirates’ future Boeing

Eight contracts booked in Q4 2016:

= four additional tranches of contracts with the European Space
Agency and the European Commission in the fields of
observation (Sentinel 1C/ID and Sentinel 3C/3D), space
exploration (Exomars} and navigation (Galileo program),

= one signalling contract for the extension of the Dubai metro;

= one contract to modernise civil and military air traffic
management across Bolivia,

= one contract to supply airborne radars to the UK Ministry of
Defence (Crowsnest project], and

= one additional contract within the scope of the Franco®British
MMCM autonomous mine countermeasures programme

Orders with a unit value of less than €100 million remained robust,
growing 8% year-on-year.

The total order intake was as expected down on 2015, which had
been boosted by an exceptional volume of large orders with a unit
value of over €100 million (€7.9 billion). These included in particular

five major contracts (with a unit value of over €500 million): orders
placed by Egypt and Gatar for Rafale fighter aircraft, the signalling of
four lines of the London underground, an order from the Australian army
for over 1,000 Hawkei vehicles, and a military satellite communications
system for France (ComSat NG}

From a geographical point of view, orders fell as expected in mature
markets [€10,138 million, a decrease of 20%), where the clients of
three of the five major 2015 orders listed above were located
Emerging markets continued to report a solid order intake
(€6,376 million, up 3%), driven by good momentum in both the
Middle East and Asia.

Order intake in the Aerospace segment fell 7% to €5,872 million,
compared to €6,281 million in 2015. Avionics continued to report a
good level of orders in both civil and military segments. In-flight
entertainment (IFE) posted an excellent commercial performance,

1.1.1.4 Sales

announcing two major airline successes: Singapore Airlines and Emirates.
The Space segment benefited from good commercial momentum,
although the order intake was understandably down on the high 2015
figure

Order intake in the Transport segment represented €1,504 million,
down 47% on 2015. The Group landed a large contract (worth
over €100 million) in the United Arab Emirates, to supply leading-edge
signalling, surveillance and telecommunications technologies for the
extension of the Dubai metro. In 2015, the order intake had been
driven by three large urban signalling contracts (Doha, Hong Kong and
London)

Order intake in the Defence & Security segment remained very high,
at €9,052 million. The 7% year-on-year deciine reflects fewer large
contracts booked in this segment (six large contracts in 2016 versus
nine in 2015)

[a] Mature markets: Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand. Emerging markets: all ther countries

Sales for 2016 were €14,885 million, compared to €14,063 million
in 2015, up 5.8% on a reported basis, and up 6.8% at constant scope
and currency" (“organic” change}, driven by very good momentum in
all segments

As expected, sales fell slightly in the fourth quarter [down 1.6% based
on reported figures, down 0.7% on an organic basis), affected by a
strong basis of comparison, particularly in the Transport and
Defence & Security segments.

From a geographical perspective, this good performance reflects both
continued strong growth in emerging markets (up 14.0%, following on
from 16.0% in 2015) and a return to organic growth in mature markets
(up 3.9%, after 0.5% in 2015). Emerging markets accounted for 30%
of the Group's sales, up from 28% in 2015 and 25% in 2014.

Sales in the Aerospace segment came in at €5,812 million, up 7.9%
compared to 2015 (up 8.5% at constant scope and currency). Sales of
commercial and military aircraft avionics and in-flight entertainment
proved particularly buoyant. However, sales of helicopter avionics, and
of microwave and imaging systems were down. Sales in the Space
segment experienced strong growth, lifted by the ramp-up of contracts
signed in 2014 and 2015 in both observation and telecommunications
activities

In the Transport segment, sales totalled €1,603 million, up 5.5%
compared to 2015 (up 8.3% at constant scope and currency). This growth
reflects the start of invoicing on the three major projects won in 2015,
combined with the recovery of activity after the execution difficulties that
had impacted 2015. The decline in sales in the fourth quarter was not
a reflection of a slowing momentum, but of a tough comparison basis,
due particularly to the catch-up impact of certain project execution
delays.

Sales in the Defence & Security segment were €7,383 million, up
4.3% compared to 2015 (up 5.0% at constant scope and currency]
Almost all businesses contributed to this momentum. The Land & Air
Systems segment posted strong growth, specifically in air defence, civil
and military radars, optronics and missile electronics. The Defence
Mission Systems segment delivered vigorous growth in fighter aircraft
systems, surface ship systems and in intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR) solutions. Only the Secure Communications and
Information Systems segment witnessed a slowdown, due mainly to the
delivery in 2015 of several large military network projects such as the
new French Ministry of Defence site ("Balard")

As expected, sales for this segment fell slightly in @4 2016 (down 3.5%
based on reported figures and down 2.7% on an organic basis). This is
explained by a contract phasing effect and a tough prior-year
comparative basis.

The Aerospace segment posted EBIT of €571 million (9.8% of sales},
versus €518 million (9.6% of sales) in 2015. The EBIT margin was driven
by a good performance in the Avionics and Space segments. Margin
growth was slowed down by a rise in restructuring costs, particularly for
microwave and imaging systems activities, and by a change in the
tules for allocating shared sales and marketing expenses to operating
segments 2)

EBIT for the Transport segment increased sharply, at €11 million (0.7%
of sales}, compared to a negative €37 million (negative 2.4% of sales)
in 2015. The operational recovery plan implemented by the new
management team continued on track, but low or zero margin contracts
still weighed on profitability. Ongoing transformation efforts and the
gradual phasing-out of low-margin contracts should help this business
regain its past profitability levels by 2018/2019.

EBIT for the Defence & Security segment was €788 million (10.7%
of sales), compared to €760 million (10.7% of sales} in 2015
On a reported basis, the EBIT margin for this segment remained stable
(down 0.1 points), affected namely by the sale of interests in two joint
ventures" The EBIT margin gained 0.3 points on an organic basis.

The contribution made by DENS to EBIT stood at €34 million in 2016,
compared to €22 million in 2015, benefiting from the gradual upturn
in its profitability, and from a non-recurring, non-operating item

Adjusted financial income

Net interest income remained low at €6 million versus €4 million in
2015. The same can be said for other adjusted financial income
(expense) ), which represented a net expense of €10 million in both
2016 and 2015. Adjusted finance costs on pensions and other
employee benefits decreased (€66 million versus €72 million in
2015), due mainly to the fall in the deficit between | January 2015 and
1 January 2016, and changes in the EUR/GBP exchange rate.

{1} Non-GAAP measure, see definition and computation on pages 8 and 9.

Adjusted net income

Adjusted net income, Group share" stood at €897 million versus
€809 million in 2015, taking into account an adjusted tax charge"!
of €314 million (€266 million in 2015). The effective tax rate was up
slightly, at 27.2% compared to 26.7% in 2015. Following the French
parliament's adoption of a reduction in corporate income tax as from
2020, the Group recognised a one-off tax charge of €18 million
reflecting the revaluation of its net deferred tax position. The effective tax
rate would have declined if this one-off item had not been recorded

Adjusted net income, Group share, per share came out at €4.25,
up 9% on 2015 (€3.89).

1.1.1.6 Consolidated results

Income from operations

Income from operations amounted to €1,097 million versus
€965 million in 2015, up 14%. This increase reflects the improvernent
in gross margin and greater discipline over indirect costs, which were
up just 4% despite the increase in R&D expenses.

Income from operations after share
in net income of equity-accounted companies

Income from operations after share in net income of equity-accounted
companies advanced 26% year on year to €1,422 million
from €1,131 million in 2015. In addition to the increase in EBIT, it was
also boosted by disposal gains, including the Raytheon (€92 million)
and Hanwha (€114 million) joint ventures. The share in net income
of equity-accounted companies came in slightly higher year on year at
€120 million, with the impact of the disposal of the two above-mentioned
joint ventures offset by higher contributions of the Group's other
equity-accounted companies.

Net income

Consolidated net income, Group share climbed 24% to €946 million,
buoyed by EBIT growth and by the sharp rise in disposals of assets.

1.1.1.7 Financial position at
31 December 2016

Free operating cash flow, at €954 million (€1,110 million in 2015)
remained high, lifted by EBIT growth and by advance payments
received on orders during the year. The Group slighty increased its
operating investments as part of the optimisation of its industrial base
(€472 million, up from €458 million in 2015). The cash conversion
rate from adjusted net income into free operating cash flow was 106%.

At 31 December 2016, net cash amounted to €2,366 million
compared to €1,978 million at end-2015, after the distribution
of €297 million in dividends (€234 million in 2015)

The net balance of acquisitions and disposals is an expenditure
of €94 million: the acquisition of Vormetric, finalised in March
[€372 million expense] was partly offset by the balancing cash
payment received in connection with the change in scope of the Thales
Raytheon Systems joint venture (€81 million) and by cash received in
relation to the sale of the shareholding in Hanwha Thales
(€204 million). In November 2016, the Group entered into exclusive
negotiations with a view to selling its ticketing business"), which reported
sales of €190 million in 2016. This project is currently in consultations
with employee representative bodies, and will be subject to customary
closing procedures

1.1.2 Risk factors

Thales is exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties which could
materially affect its business, reputation, financial position, results or
ability to achieve its objectives. The risks described below are not the
only ones that Thales faces. Other risks, currently unknown to Thales,
or which presently appear to be non-significant, could also have an
unfavourable impact on the business, profitability and financial position
of the Group or its ability to achieve its objectives

Generally, Thales may be faced with a number of operational and
strategic risks (Section 1.1.2.1), legal risks (Section 1.1.2.2) and financial
risks (Section 1.1.2.3]

governance, internal control and risk management”

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

Equity, Group share remained stable year-on-year at €4,640 million,
compared to €4,646 million at 31 December 2015, as the rise in the
net pension obligation and the dividend payout offset the impact of
consolidated net income, Group share (€946 million]

1.1.1.8 Proposed dividend

At the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2017, the Board of Directors
will propose the distribution of a dividend of €1.60 per share, an
increase of 18% on 2015

fF approved, the ex-dividend date will be 31 May 2017 and the
payment date will be 2 June 2017. The dividend will be paid fully in
cash and will amount to €1.20 per share, after deducting the interim
dividend of €0.40 per share paid in December 2016

1.1.1.9 Outlook

In 2017, Thales should benefit from positive trends in most of its markets.
Although below the highs recorded in 2015 and 2016, the order intake
in 2017 should remain brisk, at around €14 billion.

Sales should see mid-single digit organic growth compared to 2016

This positive trend, combined with continuing efforts to improve
competitiveness, should result in Thales delivering between €1,480
and €1,500 million in EBIT (based on February 2017 scope and
exchange rates], representing an increase of 9% to 11% versus 2016

Thales also confirms its mid-term objectives of a mid-single digit organic
sales growth on average in the 2016 2018 period, and an EBIT
margin of between 9.5% and 10% in 2017/2018

1.1.2.1 Operational and

strategic risks

1.1.2.1.1 Control of bids and programmes

Many of Thales’ products and systems are highly complex due to their
advanced technology content, the rigorous operational constraints and
harsh environments in which they operate (which require them to be
extremely reliable), and the contractual arrangements surrounding their
sale (comprehensive prime contractorships for large-scale systems,
public-private partnerships or their equivalent, local shares,
compensation commitments (see Section 1.1.2.1.11}, etc.)

The actual cost of design, development and manufacture may therefore
exceed initial cost estimates, which in turn may adversely impact
Thales’ results and financial position, especially considering that the
associated contracts are generally based on a fixed, all-inclusive price
In addition, many contracts include stringent performance levels and/or
tight delivery schedules for the products or systems sold, particularly
given the increased competition. If Thales is unable to deliver these
products or systems in line with the required level of performance
and/or delivery schedule, customers may demand penalty payments
or even decide to terminate the contract.


--- Page 8 ---

Bid and project management is therefore subject to a detailed risk
management and assessment process. Thales ranks the various levels of
criticality. Critical bids and projects are specifically monitored at the
management level of the operating entities (Business Lines and Global
Business Units) and, as needed, by Group management.

Contractual risk assessment is an integral part of the tendering process.
Depending on the complexity of the bid, this procedure involves
a number of steps which progressively sharpen the estimated level
of profitability and the associated risks to be assessed.

Numerous Thales contracts, particularly those that involve the most
complex products and services, run for several years. Their economic
contribution to the Group's result over a given period is therefore
assessed, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, based
on an estimate of their cost to completion

These assessments can result in uncertainties that require subsequent
correction despite the careful attention that is paid to estimates for each
project through regular reviews to measure the technical, contractual
and financial progress made

The Group pays special attention to analyses and action plans for
efficiently managing bids and projects by measuring and monitoring
financial variance on the projects as well as appropriately applying
corrective actions

As part of the Ambition Boost performance programme (see also
Section 1.1.2.1.8 "Risk of lower impact of performance improvement
measures"), the Group has also implemented action plans to improve
the management of bids and projects, engineering and the supply
chain. These actions aim in particular to:

¢ improve product policy and ensure it is better adapted to customer
needs in order to streamline new developments and thus reduce risks;

improve the management of commitments made, with the widespread
use of independent peer reviews, closer involvernent of Engineering,
Purchasing, Production, Legal and Quality Control, and the
introduction of Product and Project Design Authorities responsible for
developing the technical solutions for products and projects (during
the bid or execution phase);

@ improve the supply chain, by increasing its global dimension and
enhance the increasing maturity of emerging countries in project
implementation;

¢ improve methods, practices and tools to make them more relevant to
international products/projects {e.g., through the implementation of
a project management tool adapted to emerging countries, SAP by
Design|;

¢ introduce advanced training for project managers to obtain
International Project Management Association (IPMA) certification
At the end of 2016, nearly 1,200 project managers within the Group
had gained IPMA certification, with approximately 180 certified
during the year.

1.1.2.1.2 Supplier risk

Purchases constitute a very significant proportion of Thales’ business,
representing nearly half its sales with purchases ranging from industrials
fo services, equipment and sub-systems. Thales is therefore exposed to
the risk of the industrial, technical or financial failure of any of its
suppliers, which in turn could affect the Group's profitability and
performance

Management report — 2016 Financial Information

There are two major types of supplier risk

e legal or regulatory non-compliance (ethics, export control,
intellectual property, etc.); these risks are handled by the
departments concerned using the Group Risk Management system
with the support of the Purchasing department;

estructural and operational risks that could disrupt supply, which are
dealt with by the Purchasing department using the Group Risk
Management system. The Purchasing department has identified two
key triggers: supplier default and economic dependence

Risk of supplier default

Supplier default could be caused by a major incident at one of its sites,
by its external environment (shortage of raw materials or components,
major political instability, natural disaster, etc.) or through
mismanagement. The supplier's management performance is monitored
both in operating terms (poor procurement planning, failure to manage
tier 2 suppliers, loss of control over industrial processes, plant
obsolescence, etc.) and in cross-disciplinary and financial terms [poor
skills management, loss of know-how, fall in sales, mismanagement of
working capital requirement, cash flow problems, administration or
bankrupicy protection, etc.). A combination of problems could lead to
the disappearance of a company or its takeover by investors with
different interests from those of Thales.

Consequently, faced with this risk of a supply shortage, Thales
implements a dual sourcing (or alternative-source} policy as frequently
as possible for each technology family, regularly updated and
accompanied by buffer stocks that cover its requirements until customer
contracts have been fulfilled

In addition, given the increased risk of fragility of certain suppliers in the
current economic climate, Thales has introduced a special approach
Based on close cooperation between buyers and financial teams, it is
aimed at identifying, from among its critical suppliers, those that would
be particularly susceptible financially and implementing an appropriate
action plan to ensure continuity of supply. Apart from individual
monitoring, an analysis is carried out by technology field in conjunction
with the professional bodies concerned, to identify appropriate
solutions.

Alongside these financial supervision measures, Purchasing and Quality
Control have stepped up their appraisal, accreditation and
management of supplier performance to better identify structural risks.
Supplier performance audits are broad-based (covering quality control,
industrial maturity, flow optimisation, compliance with environmental
regulations, expertise in technical and technological processes,
financial strength, etc.) and therefore allow a complete risk analysis to
be carried out. When executing a purchasing contract, Thales closely
monitors the implementation by the supplier of measures aimed at
tackling the risks identified during the selection process.

Risk of economic dependence

The economic dependence of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
(SMEs) on Thales is considered a separate risk in its own right. It is
particularly significant now that the economic crisis has disrupted the
sales portfolios of a number of them, jeopardising the operating cycle
with Thales and potentially leading to a supply shortage.

In order to mitigate this risk, the commitment rate (orders placed by
Thales as a percentage of the supplier's total annual sales} is monitored
for each panel of suppliers by market segment (vertical approach) and
for the main countries where the Group is established (France, the UK,
the Netherlands, etc.)

2016 Registration Document — THALES

15


--- Page 9 ---

2016 Financial Information — Management report

16

If the commitment rate exceeds 50% for more than two consecutive
years, an action plan coordinated with internal specifiers and internal
users is drawn up and implemented in order to return to a commitment
rate of 25%.

The purchasing policy, supplier selection and performance monitoring
processes and supervisory and risk mitigation measures are also all
designed to reduce these risks, during both the bidding phase and the
project implementation phase.

1.1.2.1.3 Human resources risk

a) Workplace health and safety

Ensuring a healthy and safe working environment for its employees
pursuant to the laws in force, monitoring procedures, preventing health
and professional risks and employee training are key priorities for
Thales.

These principles are reflected in a structure designed to prevent risks
related to health and safety in the workplace, whether on Thales sites or
external sites, and to manage major health crises that could occur
internationally.

Regular monitoring of the risks to which the Group's employees may be
exposed is performed each year.

Practical measures are also implemented by the Group’s Human
Resources department and Health, Safety and Environment department
in relation to employee health and safety in the workplace. Thales is
also committed to increasing the quality of life in the workplace.
In France, for example, a three-year Group agreement on “quality of
life at work” was signed on 4 February 2014. Continuing the
approach adopted in the agreement signed in 2009 on the same
subject, the agreement defines a general framework for prevention and
aims to place particular focus on psycho-social risks by implerenting
individual and collective preventive actions.

Proof of the Group's continuing commitment to certification, 106 Thales
entities (representing 82% of the workforce) had obtained
OHSAS 18001 certification by the end of 2016

b) Talent development

If Thales is not attractive enough to recruit the qualified staff it needs in a
timely manner and to retain and motivate its employees to develop and
Tun its business, sales and operating profitability could be negatively

affected
Thales’ success and performance effectively depend on:

its capacity to recruit employees in the different employment markets,
in France and abroad;

the quality of the key skills and the commitment of its employees; and

e its capacity to globally manage the talent required for the
development of its activity worldwide.

Thales therefore attaches great importance to its attractiveness and
positioning as a top employer, ensuring a positive external image which
will boost recruitment and an internal work environment that will
contribute to retain employees.

As an attractive and recognised employer in France, Thales is also
building up its image in all the countries where the Group is already
present or plans to develop, notably through communication campaigns
and partnerships with leading universities. In addition, a global
recruitment function, attached to the HR general management has been
created to help the Group develop in these geographical zones

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

The global process of identifying and managing talent within the Group
has also been reinforced by encouraging interaction between
management teams in different parts of the organisation.

Thales is also continuing its proactive skills management policy for the
Group's main professional families. A Steering committee per family,
composed of operational and HR managers, conducts a yearly analysis
of changes in jobs, expertise, and the needs of the Company, and
establishes action plans (for training, anticipated management of
internal mobility, external recruitment, etc.). To complement this tool,
each year the Group's internal university updates key training
programmes in response to changing needs. Significant work has been
carried out to pinpoint employee soft skills, namely for those employees
attached to the R&D Systems, R&D Hardware and R&D Sofware job
families. This work helps to more precisely identify training and
recruitment requirements. This approach is now being extended to other
job families such as Purchasing, Engineering and Project Managernent

Lastly, in 2013, the Group signed a series of agreements with the
unanimous support of the trade union organisations in France that
encourage the integration of young people, either on work-study training
schemes or post-qualification, and the transfer of knowledge (the Generation
Contract); that develop diversity (the Gender Equality Agreement); and
that take a forward-looking approach to jobs and skills

These agreements will allow the Group to better manage the integration
of young graduates in France, improve the development of its critical
skills, promote diversity and better anticipate changes within the Group.

1.1.2.1.4 Environmental risks

For many years, Thales has conducted a regular analysis and update of
environmental risks in accordance with its business activities, scientific
and technical developments as well as with current regulatory change.

This analysis is aimed a

© regularly ensuring that employees and neighbouring residents are
not exposed to health and environmental risks (pollution, asbestos,
etc.) through their activities or work environment, whether on Thales
or external sites;

e ensuring the compliance of activities and products (substances,
waste, etc.);

analysing the impact of new regulations (e.g., REACH in Europe) on
the supply chain and on product design;

analysing the impact of the environment on activities {water stress,
climatic events, etc.);

identifying an appropriate organisational structure and associated
action plans, either at Group level or locally, based on the results of
this analysis.

To support this analysis, an Environmental Management System has
been rolled out at all sites in order to ensure that the environmental
impacts of products and operations are controlled and limited. Part of
the Group reporting arrangement, this management system encompasses
the different functions, such as engineering, manufacturing, supply chain,
purchasing, contract management, auditing and risk management, etc.
Special training, communication tools and shared experience are used
to support the approach

At the end of 2016, 120 entities had been certified ISO 14001,
representing 89% of the Group's workforce.

Thales also regularly assesses the risks linked to climate change in order
to evaluate their impact on activity and costs. The main risks identified are:

regulatory change (reporting, carbon taxes, etc.) which has a very
limited impact for Thales (not affected by the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme]. Nevertheless, Thales closely monitors current and future
laws and regulations in order to analyse and anticipate their impact
and set in place the requisite measures;


--- Page 10 ---

climate change (floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, water stress, etc.)
that can lead to damages and a continuous disruption in activity at
Thales sites as well as the sites of its subcontractors and partners.

To manage this risk and reduce its vulnerability, Thales has carried
out regular assessments of the exposure of its different sites to natural
disasters and their consequences for several years now. Action plans
linked to these assessments have been defined in order to attenuate
this risk (see Section 5.2.4), and the Group's insurance policies [see
Section 1.1.2.4 Insurance) are also based on these assessments.

A tisk mapping linked to water shortages has also been carried out.
The majority of Group sites in vulnerable areas are offices that have
very limited risk exposure given their low water consumption

An analysis of “natural disaster” and “water stress” risks is now
included in the regular prevention visits at the Group's sites and
those of its critical subcontractors;

e any failure by Thales to implement adequate measures in the fight
against climate change that would have a negative impact on its
corporate image. As a Group that is regularly consulted by
increasingly exacting stakeholders (customers, investors, civil society,
etc.) regarding its carbon strategy, Thales publishes information on the
measures in place and the results obtained (see also Section 5.2.4).
In 2016, it was awarded a rating of A- for its “climate change”
performance (Carbon Disclosure Project], making it one of the
best-performing companies listed

At 31 December 2016, reserves for environmental contingencies
amounted to €6.7 million.

1.1.2.1.5 Security breaches in respect of
sites and employees

Thales is exposed to attempts to breach the security of its sites (attempts
by unauthorised persons to access confidential information, threats to
the physical security of sites and facilities, etc.). The occurrence of such
events could affect the rollout of the Group's activities and its reputation
and, consequenily, its results and financial position

In order to minimise this risk, the Group Security department has drafted
a policy for regulating access to and movement around all Group sites.
This policy is applied by the Group's network of security officers. In its
defence businesses, the Group is subject to different national
regulations requiring it to implement measures to protect its employees
and industrial assets.

The Group is therefore required to undergo to a large number of audits
and inspections by the national supervisory authorities.

It has also implemented a global procedure for employee safety and
protection in all of the countries in which they perform their work. In
certain countries, this global procedure runs alongside a local
intervention system, which ensures a quick response to incidents.

Lastly, faced with the current heightened terrorist threat, the Group has
also increased the level of security and protection for its most sensitive
sites. These measures are particularly important in France given the
number and nature of sites in the country.

1.1.2.1.6 Risk of IT system failure

The Group operates — whether directly or through service providers —
complex IT systems and infrastructures that are essential to the smooth
running of its commercial, industrial and financial processes. These
information systems include management, development and engineering
systems as well as platforms operated on behalf of our customers, and
must be protected against any malfunctions, natural disasters, malicious
acts or human error at all costs. The malfunction or failure of these
systems may have external causes [viruses or hacking, power cuts or
network failures, natural disasters, etc.) or internal causes (malicious

Management report — 2016 Financial Information

acts, breaches of data confidentiality, human error or obsolescence}
Any such malfunction or failure can have an impact on the Group's
operations and its financial results.

To guard against these growing risks, the Group has implemented
multi-year plans to deal with part of its IT systems being temporarily or
permanently unavailable, as well as any cyber-security threats to these
systems.

The plan is completed by efforts to raise employee awareness of these
threats.

Lastly, the Thales IT system security strategy has been approved by Group
management, in close cooperation with the national and governmental
authorities of the countries concerned. Any such incidents could have
an impact on the Group's operations and its financial results.

Business continuity

The Disaster Recovery Plan in case of the failure of part of Thales’ IT
systems has been adapted to the countries in which the Group is
present. A methodology to prevent the risk of a failure of the Group's IT
systems also exists to ensure disaster recovery solutions are adapted to
the degree of risk and their operational impact. More specifically,
the plan is based on an analysis of the criticality of the different services
given their impact on the Group's operations, and undergoes regular
fest runs.

Cyber-security

A plan to protect against risks related to cyber-security has been
defined and implemented in countries where the Group currently
operates. As well as continuing to adapt the means of protection
already in place, the plan includes the implementation of new measures
to heighten the protection of sensitive information, and the development
of systems for early identification and prompt correction of any
non-compliances. It is adapted to new regulations and practices e.g
the use of Cloud computing}, uses new technologies (e.g., solutions
developed by Vormetric which was recently acquired by the Group],
and includes the implementation of “CyberSecurity Operation Centers"
so that anomalies and incidents that could affect the security of our
systems are identified as early as possible and the appropriate solutions
put in place.

In order to ensure the convergence and coherence of cyber-security
and defence measures throughout the Group, a number of “key rules”
linked to Thales’ IT systems have been adopted by the IT departments at
a global level. Their effective application is regularly monitored and
reporting submitted to the Group IT Security department.

The implementation and control of internal cyber-defence measures
benefits from the expertise of the Group teams responsible for the
protection of customer IT systems.

Awareness and know-how

The plan is completed by ongoing efforts to raise employee awareness
of these threats. Communication campaigns and training are rolled out
to remind users of the best practices that will help ensure the security of
their IT systems. More recently, regular website forums have also been
held in which all employees are encouraged to take part

While all of the measures and action plans put in place by Thales
significantly reinforce the level of protection for the Group's information
systems, they do not guarantee complete immunity against failures that
may have an impact on business and operations.

1.1.2.1.7 Risk related to failure of
equipment or technology

Thales systems and equipment are highly complex and technical and
are likely to be integrated within high-value civil or military platforms
A malfunction of any such systems, equipment or technologies could
result in client claims or third-party litigation. Thales could therefore be
held liable, notably in the event of damage to property or personal
injury, or in the event that they result in a disruption in the business and
activities of its customers. Were they to occur, such events would be
liable to impact Thales’ results and financial position, as well as its
reputation

In order to limit the impact, Thales has put Group-wide standards in
place (Design Authority, quality, documentation, contractual
arrangements and risk management). In addition, Thales follows
a policy of maintaining appropriate insurance coverage [see
Section 1.1.2.4 “Insurance")

1.1.2.1.8 Risk of lower impact of
performance improvement
measures

In 2014, to support its medium-term financial targets, Thales launched
the “Ambition Boost" performance plan to increase the entire Group's
performance

This global performance plan provides a common framework within
which the units can implement plans and initiatives adapted to their own
issues in terms of performance improvements. Five new cross-disciplinary
initiatives are also now in place to complete and strengthen the
performance plans: Going Global; Competitiveness; Leadership
Governance; Diversity and Inclusion; and Digital Transformation

The earings and financial position of Thales could be negatively
impacted if the initiatives planned under the Ambition Boost framework
could not be fully implemented or if they failed to generate the expected
results according to the original timetable. Moreover, the cost of
implementing these initiatives could end up being higher than expected,
which is why Thales has introduced specific monitoring for performance
improvement initiatives. The Group's corporate management regularly
reviews the progress of the main initiatives.

1.1.2.1.9 Competitive environment

Thales operates in highly competitive markets, both in terms of
international groups and in terms of local or niche companies in certain
market segments. This competitive pressure could negatively impact
Thales’ commercial position, sales and profits

It could also intensify in an unfavourable economic environment and
there is no guarantee that Thales will be able to position itself
successfully against its current or future competitors.

In order to limit the impact of this risk, Thales continues its research and
development efforts in order to provide more competitive and
differentiating elements, and it also works to structure and upgrade its
product offer in order to meet the needs of its customers in both the
defence and civil markets.

The Group's success and performance in relation to its competitors also
depend on its capacity to recruit and retain quality employees with the
requisite skills and commitment. Thales therefore attaches great
importance to its attractiveness and positioning as a top employer,
ensuring a positive external image which will boost recruitment and
an internal work environment that will help retain employees (see
Section 1.1.2.1.3-b} “Talent development”)

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

1.1.2.1.10 Offsets

In some countries, the awarding of major contracts, particularly defence
contracts, may be dependent on a legal or regulatory requirement to
fulfil a direct, semi-direct or indirect offset requirement. The Group's ability
to factor this into a proposal can be a major source of differentiation
and, as such, have a decisive impact on its commercial success or failure.

The non-fulfilment of contractual offset obligations within the requisite
deadlines can result in penalties, the payment of which does not
always release the obligor from its obligations. It can also compromise
the Group's capacity to develop its activities in a given country.

Thales’ order intake in recent years (particularly the order for the Rafale
fighter aircraft placed by the Indian authorities in the third quarter of
2016) has led to a substantial increase in its offset obligations

Faced with these risks, Thales has set in place a dedicated structure,
both at a central level and for its exporting units and destination
countries, which is responsible for integrating and overseeing these
obligations as early as the bid phase. The Group also has a specific
unit that is entirely devoted to the management of indirect offsets, Thales
International Offsets (TIO).

1.1.2.1.11 Market trends

The markets on which Thales operates are broadly correlated to the
current economic backdrop, but can also be impacted by specific
factors: technological breakthroughs, drastic changes in Business Models,
deregulation, new standards, real or perceived increase in the threat of
terrorism, changes in oil prices, conflicts or major political change,
epidemics and disasters that could have an impact, however temporary,
on these markets. This is particularly true of the civil aviation market. As
part of the development of its activities related to in-flight broadband,
Thales entered into a strategic agreement with SES to secure bandwidth
over the Americas. Under this agreement, Thales committed to an
annual bandwidth purchasing programme over the period 2016 to
2028 and the payment to SES of a set minimum fee. The profitability of
this business could therefore be affected if the sale of the broadband
services was lower than forecast for several consecutive years

The main risk mitigation factors are Thales’ efforts to promote the offer to
airlines and the flexibility built into the agreement.

More generally, to limit the impact of market risk, Thales constantly
seeks (i) to adapt its product lines to foreseeable changes in demand
and to improve their competitive performance and industrial flexibility in
line with fluctuations in activity, and (ii) a comprehensive strategy
to balance its business portfolio.

1.1.2.1.12 Dependence on public
procurement

Thales generates a significant share of its business from governments,
particularly in the defence markets in France and the UK, and, to a lesser
extent, in the rest of Europe, North America and Australia. In these
markets, public spending is dependent on political and economic factors
and is therefore likely to fluctuate from one year to the next. A reduction
in the budget resources of government customers, for example, could
generate delays in order booking, contract execution and payments, or
mean a cut in funding for research and development programmes.

Thales has based its strategy on a balanced portfolio of defence
operations and civil operations, each accounting for approximately
50% of sales. The overall solidity of the portfolio is underpinned by a
diversified order base with a unit value of less than €100 million
Finally, the broad geographic spread of Thales’ business, particularly
through its international operations, ensures further diversification of its
customer base


--- Page 12 ---

1.1.2.1.13 Political risks

A significant proportion of Thales’ sales is subject to the risk of
economic and/or political instability in the countries in which the Group
operates. The materialisation of these risks may affect the Group's
financial position and profitability.

In particular, a change in government, major political event, armed
conflict, act of terrorism, sharp deterioration in the balance of payments,
industrial action, strike or protest could lead to various types of risks.
These include:

¢ more restrictive currency control, with limitations or exclusions on
withdrawing currency from a customer country, preventing it from
honouring its financial commitments to Thales;

impairment of assets because of devaluations of the local currency
or other measures taken by public authorities that significantly affect
the value of operations;

¢ expropriation (by confiscation, nationalisation, requisition, etc.) or
the forced sale of Thales’ interest in a local company, of, more
broadly, discriminatory measures that compromise Thales’
operations in a country;

e a security situation entailing a risk of bodily harm for its employees
and/or security breaches at its facilities, which severely limit or
prevent Thales from assuming its performance obligations under
acontract, or reduce or prohibit the use of its local industrial assets;

¢ an unexpected breach of a contract or commitment;
© an unfair call of a bond or a guarantee;

the non-certification of documents eligible for payment, or non-payment
on the due dates stipulated in a contract, that prevent the
anticipated progress of that contract.

To limit the financial impact of these risks, Thales seeks to protect its
interests as far as possible through contractual provisions. In addition,
the Group may use government and/or private sector insurers when
necessary to provide appropriate cover. If applicable, it may also
transfer receivables without recourse to financial institutions

Lastly, the Group has implemented a global procedure for employee
security, crisis detection and response, protection and monitoring (see
Section 1.1.2.1.5 Security breaches in respect of sites and staff}.

On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom, which represents
approximately 10% of Group sales and 6,500 employees, voted by
referendum to leave the European Union. This decision could have
a number of consequences on the activities and financial performance
of Thales. It could notably lead to a higher degree of volatility beween
the pound sterling and the euro, in interest rates and in the value of plan
assets covering the Group's pension commitments in the United
Kingdom. The management of these financial risks is part of the
procedures set in place by the Group and described in Section 1.1.2.3
on Financial risks. The risk of an increase in tariff barriers is
automatically reduced by Thales’ predominant use of local country
production resources, a strategy which also tends to reduce the effects
of greater volatility in the pound since sales and production costs are
essentially denominated in the same currency. In the long term, the
hardest risk to assess relates to the possible impact of this decision on
UK economic growth and its defence budget. The geographic
diversification of Thales’ activities limits the potential impact of this risk.

Management report — 2016 Financial Information

1.1.2.1.14 Risks relating to strategic
acquisitions and investments

Thales regularly looks to acquire new companies [as well as making
strategic investments and combining business activities through joint
ventures, etc.) in order to round out its technological portfolio and
strengthen its presence in certain markets. Integrating these businesses
into Thales could prove more difficult and take longer than envisaged,
requiring more significant involvement by senior managers and the
teams concerned and, in turn, negatively impacting the Group's results
and financial position

In addition, there are no guarantees that the newly acquired companies
will perform as well as expected in accordance with the initial business
plans, which form the basis of the investment decision. This type of
variance could lead to the recognition of impairment losses on goodwill
and other intangible assets, thereby negatively impacting Thales’ results
and financial position

Before any planned acquisitions, Thales conducts audits and due
diligence with the assistance of external consultants where necessary, in
order to analyse the fundamentals of the target company. A review is
also conducted at each key stage in the acquisition process to confirm
Thales’ interest and set the necessary conditions and parameters to
ensure a successful outcome. The newly acquired company is then
integrated into Thales’ financial reporting system so that its performance
can be monitored.

An internal audit is carried out for all major acquisitions within 18 months
of the finalisation of the operation. These audits assess the different
stages of the transaction, the strength of the business plans that led to
the decision, the implementation of the initial synergies and the level
of performance in relation to the commitments made.

1.1.2.1.15

ks related to minority
investments

Thales generates part of its sales from companies in which control is
shared with, or exercised by, other partners; in accordance with the
accounting principles in force on | January 2016, these companies are
consolidated using the equity method"

The share in net income of equity-accounted companies is included in
Thales’ EBIT!2| and adjusted net income. A deterioration in the
performance of these companies may therefore impact on the Group's
income and financial position

Since Thales’ influence over these minority investments varies, decisions
that are detrimental to the interests of Thales may be taken, without
Thales necessarily having the means to oppose them

In addition, the risk of disagreement or deadlock, inherent in any
jointly-controlled entity, exists, particularly in those where important
decisions require the unanimity of members or where there are limited
exit rights.

Lastly, the application of management rules and principles in these
entities may differ from those adopted by Thales for entities over which
it exerts exclusive control. This also means that the ability to carry out
analyses and give instructions regarding financial or operational data,
‘or even fo access this data, may be more limited than in the entities
over which Thales exerts exclusive control.

As a result, the Group aims to define appropriate governance methods
by seeking to be represented on the Board of Directors {or a similar
decision-making body], and more generally, to negotiate contractual
provisions that are in Thales’ best interests.

1.1.2.2 Legal and
compliance risks

1.1.2.2.1 Compliance with laws
and regulations

The Group operates its business in a strict and evolving complex legal
and regulatory environment, both nationally and internationally.

Thales’ international activities mean that, although it must monitor
developments in the legal and regulatory environments in which it
operates, it is not always able to foresee them which may affect its
business.

Despite the steps taken by Thales to comply with all applicable legislation,
risks still exist due to their inherent nature, the interpretative powers
of regulatory agents, the extraterritorial reach of certain regulations,
and changes in legal/judicial precedent and sanctioning powers

In most cases, regulators in conjunction with the judicial authorities have
the right to initiate legal proceedings, which could expose the Group or
its employees to civil, administrative or criminal rulings. Such rulings
could, if applicable, involve a temporary ban on trading, which would
in turn have an adverse impact on the Group's profitability and financial
position

Using a risk map, the Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department carries
‘out assessments and audits of the implementation and improvement of
compliance plans within the Group's units. Compliance measures rely
for these needs on networks of compliance officers who may be
specialists (in export control) and on risk advisors responsible for
the prevention of each of the major risks identified and monitored by
the Risk Assessment Committee.

The Audit, Risks & Internal Control department takes into account these
compliance areas when preparing its audit plan

a) Business ethics

Thales’ business encompasses a variety of sectors in more than 50 countries.
Infingement of applicable laws and regulations may have severe legal
and financial consequences and seriously harm the Group's reputation

An integrity programme linked to corruption risk prevention has been in
place in all Group entities for more than 15 years. A Code of Ethics
exists for all Group employees that is regularly updated in line with
external and internal reference systems and is posted on the Group
intranet. With a preface by the Chairman and CEO, it reaffirms in
particular the principle of zero tolerance for any act of corruption
Thales’ integrity programme was certified by independent third parties
Mazars and ADIT in 2014. It is currently being updated following the
publication of the French law on Transparency, the fight against
corruption and the modernisation of the economy, known as the
loi Sapin Il law, in order to ensure that the measures taken by the
Group are in line with the latest legal requirements

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

The risk factors inherent in business are handled by the various
processes that govern the management of bids and projects in the
Thales reporting system (Chorus 2.0). From the preliminary phase of a
project, these operating processes envisage action plans to mitigate
business risks, focusing particularly on the prevention of corruption

Thales strictly supervises the use of agents and consultants by means of
a very detailed procedure that provides for in-depth upstream checks
and controls (due diligence) - backed by an analysis of the risk factors
at play — and all appropriate declarations and undertakings on the part
of these agents or consultants. Designed by the Group's Ethics &
Corporate Responsibility department, this procedure is regularly revised
in conjunction with the Group's Legal department and International
Development department.

The players in the supply chain are also stakeholders in the integrity
policy: at the end of 2016, 10,500 suppliers and subcontractors in the
portfolio pledged to adhere to the terms of the Thales Company
Purchasing and Corporate Responsibility charter.

Thales is particularly keen to make its employees aware of ethical
business conduct as soon as they join the Group. Adherence and
accountability are key to the awareness and training model designed
by the Ethics and Corporate Responsibility department. A wide range
of guides reference guide and ethical business conduct guides) and
training (both face-to-face and via e-learning) is available to employees
throughout their careers. More than 8,000 employees have been
trained since 2008, including 1,346 in 2016.

In order to reinforce the Thales approach to Ethics & Corporate
Responsibility, and to ensure that each employee is involved in the
prevention of risks, a set of ethics alerts is available to all of the Group's
employees

In addition to its rigorous internal control procedures, the Audit,
Risks & Internal Control Department conducts regular compliance and
integrity audits on the various components of the model

The Thales integrity programme has been recognised by stakeholders,
and Thales’ listing on the DJSI [Dow Jones Sustainability Indices) Europe
and World has been confirmed for the second year in a row. The
Group is one of the four leading European companies in Transparency
International's “Corruption Perceptions Index" covering companies in the
defence sector. Moreover, the Group has renewed its support for
the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. It is one of
600 companies around the world to have submitted their
Communication on Progress to the UN with Global Compact Advanced
status

The overall system is completed by Thales’ active participation in
various initiatives in the fight against corruption. Thales also actively
participates in national professional organisations (including MEDEF,
GIFAS and ADS") and international organisations (Business Ethics
committee of ASD), ICC! B20"), IFBEC"), etc.) dealing with business
ethics, and has an active presence within the working groups of
intergovernmental organisations (OECD, United Nations, etc.).

b) Export control

Exports account for a significant proportion of Thales’ business. Many
of the Group's products and systems are designed for military or dual
use applications. Consequently, the export of these products or systems
to customers located outside Thales’ domestic markets where they are
manufactured, particularly in the defence sector, may be subject to
limitations, export licences or specific export controls (imposed by the
countries in which Thales operates, as well as by other countries where
the suppliers of component products or technologies are based, most
notably the United States)


--- Page 14 ---

There are no guarantees that (i) the export controls to which Thales is
subject will not be tightened; (ii) new-generation products or systems
developed by Thales will not be subject to similar or tighter controls;
and (iii) geopolitical factors will not make it impossible for Thales or its
suppliers to obtain export licences for certain customers or make it more
difficult for Thales to execute previously signed contracts. Further
limitations on access to military markets would thus have a negative
impact on Thales’ business, profitability and financial position

Thales has introduced systems and formal procedures to ensure
compliance with applicable regulations and controls, and reinforces
these measures through awareness-raising programmes with dedicated
elearning modules and alerts on legislative and regulatory changes
relating to export control that are relevant to Thales’ business. Operating
units have access to a network of specialists within the Group, who are
responsible for monitoring the application within operating units of
compliance rules decided at Group level as well as monitoring the
necessary authorisations and the conformity of their implementation.

c) Competition law

Thales’ business activities are subject to a wide range of national and
international regulations mainly aimed at combating anti-competitive
practices.

Infringement of these rules could lead to severe sanctions, such as fines,
payment of damages and interest, and legal bans, and could also
have a serious impact on the Group's reputation

To avoid any such infringements, Thales has initiated a programme to
raise awareness of these rules, in particular through dedicated training
programmes

d) Intellectual property

Thales is exposed to two main types of intellectual property risk:
dependence on third-party technology and third-party actions against
the Company for perceived infringement of their intellectual property
rights.

To reduce the risk of reliance on critical third-party technology, Thales
has implemented a process to identify and manage each situation with
a precise, strategic "Make/Team/Buy” (MTB) plan

Given the nature of its activities and the specific features of its products,
Thales conducts most of its research and development work in-house
and controls the technology which is critical to the business. Thales’
extensive intellectual property portfolio (over 16,500 patents, as well as
software and know-how] and its presence throughout the value chain
(equipment, systems and systems of systems) reduce its reliance on third-party
technology. As a result, Thales’ dependence on such technology can
be considered very low.

To reduce the risk of third-party actions for alleged infringement of their
intellectual property rights by Thales entities, the Group identifies and
analyses this risk in the context of its own patent filing procedures
and/or when embarking on technical research or product development.

In the event of a third-party infringement claim against a Thales
company, the legal and technical analysis of the allegedly infringing
products and intellectual property rights are handled centrally by Thales
experts, with the assistance of specialist external consultants where

needed

Management report — 2016 Financial Information

1.1.2.2.2 Litigation

Due to the nature of its business activities, Thales is exposed to the risk
of technical and commercial litigation

To prevent disputes or limit their impact, Thales’ policy is to systematically
seek alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This policy is reviewed
‘on a regular basis to take into account changes in the Group's core
areas of business and is backed by employee training programmes

In addition, Thales implemented a procedure several years ago to
centralise all civil commercial and criminal litigation and claims. These
are handled by the Corporate Legal Affairs department, with the
support of the Group companies involved

At the end of 2002, a group of French manufacturers, including Thales
and one of its subsidiaries, collectively received a request for arbitration
from a shared customer claiming an amount which allegedly should be
no less than $260 million and for which the group of French
manufacturers might be jointly liable towards the claimant. This request
for arbitration is related to the execution of old contracts by the group of
French manufacturers. Pursuant fo an agreement signed by all of the
parties in June 2003, the claimant withdrew its request for arbitration.
In November 2012, the claimant filed a new request for arbitration for
a revised amount of €226 million of which Thales’ share would be
around 28% of the amount claimed. The manufacturers are strongly
disputing this demand and at this date it is not possible to evaluate any
potential financial risk. Accordingly, Thales has not set aside a provision
in respect of this dispute. Proceedings are ongoing

There are no other government, judicial or arbitration claims of which
the Group is aware, which are pending or threatened and which could
have or have had, any significant effect on the financial position or
profitability of the Company and/or the Group in the last 12 months

1.1.2.3

nancial risks

1.1.2.,

1 Liquidity

The Group's liquidity risk is the risk of it being unable to meet its cash
needs out of its financial resources. In particular, it relates to Thales’
level of exposure to changes in the main market indicators that could
lead to an increase in the cost of credit, or even to a temporary
limitation of access to external sources of financing,

The Group manages this risk by trying to anticipate its cash needs and
ensures that these are covered by the short-term and long-term financial
resources, as follows:

e shareholders’ equity, listed by heading in Note 8 to the
consolidated financial statements;

gross debt, listed by maturity in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements;

committed, undrawn credit facilities granted by banks as backup to
the commercial paper programme and acting as a financial
reserve. These are described in more detail in Note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements.

The principle of centralising the entities’ short-term assets and liabilities
(cash pooling) is applied to the combination of entities in the same
currency zone (eurozone, sterling zone, dollar zone and Australian
dollar zone, etc.) and, in some cases, in the same country.

By consolidating and centralising the cash requirements and surpluses
of its units, the Group is in a position to:

simplify cash management and match the cash positions of units to
produce a single consolidated position that is easier to manage; and

gain prime access to financial markets through the parent
company’s financing programmes, rated by Standard & Poor's and
Moody's (see below}

2016 Registration Document — THALES

21


--- Page 15 ---

2016 Financial Information — Management report

22

At 31 December 2016, cash recorded under consolidated assets
amounted to €3,616.9 million (compared with €3,450.2 million at
end-2015], including

© €3,183.1 million held by the parent company and available for
immediate use (€2,949.8 millon in 2015];

¢ €433.8 million in the bank credit balances of subsidiaries
(€500.4 million in 2015), most of them outside of France. This
figure includes, inter alia, payments received in the last few days of
the financial year and subsequently transferred to the corporate
treasury account.

Cash at bank and equivalents at year-end is invested solely in bank
deposits, in very short-term bank certificates of deposit with first-tier
banks or in money market funds. At the date of publication, Thales’
credit risk ratings were as follows:

The decrease of Thales’ credit risk rating would not trigger the financial
covenants included in its financing contracts. The coming into effect of
the unique clause providing for accelerated repayment would only
apply in the event that the French State no longer held its golden share
and, simultaneously, the ratio of consolidated net financial debt to
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation)
were to exceed 3

A lower rating would result in an increase (capped) in the margins
applicable to the committed credit facility of €1.5 billion (described in
Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements); at the same time, these
margins would be improved (with a minimum threshold) in the event
of a rating upgrade.

1.1.2.3.2 Interest rates

Moody’s Standard Thales is exposed to interest rate volatility and in particular its impact on
& Poor's the conditions associated with variable-rate financing. To limit this risk,
Thales operates an active interest rate hedging policy.
Medium & long-term loans 42 A the Corporate Financing and Treasury depariment consolidates data
Outlook Stable Stable on Thales’ exposure to interest rate risk and uses appropriate financial
Commercial paper & short-term loans Prime-1 2 _ instruments to hedge those risks
Thales policy is to control interest rate and counterpart risks and to
optimise its funding and banking operations.
The breakdown of Thales’ debt by type of interest rate is described in
Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The table below
summarises the Group's exposure to interest rate risk before and after
hedging. Based on the average net cash {taking into account hedging
instruments), a 1% rise in interest rates would increase the financial
interest, net by €21.6 million in 2016 (€11.4 million in 2015).

1.1.2.3.3 Foreign exchange

Due to the international nature of its business, Thales is exposed to the
risk of exchange rate fluctuations

a) Business-related currency risk

Business-related currency risk occurs when some of the business is billed
in a currency other than that of the related costs

a. As a general tule, Thales is structurally immune to exchange rate
fluctuations for a significant part of its business activity. Around 40%
of Thales’ sales are generated in the eurozone, which a significant
portion of its industrial operations are located. More generally,
the reinforcement of the Group's international industrial footprint
allows it to manufacture and invoice in local currency, which helps
to reduce exchange rate risk on local sales.

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

b. The accounts of Thales subsidiaries located in countries where the
official currency is not the euro are translated into euros in the
Group's consolidated financial statements. A fall in these currencies
against the euro is likely to have a negative impact on the accounts.
lis impact on profitability is limited, however, since the cost base of
these subsidiaries is essentially in the same currency as their sales.
The main currencies are the pound sterling, the US dollar,
the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar.

°

For certain Group businesses (civil avionics and microwave systems,
civil space, etc.}, the US dollar ("$” or “USD"} is the reference
transaction currency. For business activities outside the dollar zone
(the in-flight entertainment and connectivity business is based
essentially in the United States and is therefore naturally immune
to this risk], a specific currency risk hedging policy is implemented

= for equipment transactions (avionics and microwave systems), this
policy is defined on the basis of sales forecasts in USD, after
accounting for corresponding purchases in USD. For these
transactions, net exposure to dollar risk represents around 3.5%
of the Group's total sales for 2016;


--- Page 16 ---

= for longerterm programmes in markets traditionally denominated
in USD (primarily in civil space}, each bid is examined
for profitability in light of the effect of currency fluctuations,
after accounting for corresponding purchases in USD, and,
if necessary, is specifically hedged through market transactions
(forward exchange-rate contracts and options)

Where necessary, a similar approach is adopted for other Thales
activities if a customer specifically requires a contract denominated
in USD on an ad hoc basis.

Overall, net exposure amounted to around 2.5% of the Group's
total sales for 2016;

= as well as this direct dollar risk, which concerned around 6% in
total of consolidated sales at end-2016, the Group is also
exposed to an "indirect" dollar risk on contracts denominated in
currencies other than the dollar. This occurs when it is bidding
against companies that benefit from a cost base in dollars.
Approximately one quarter of total sales may be exposed to this
“indirect” dollar risk.

The “dollar risk” is thus the main currency risk thot Thales needs to hedge
The figures corresponding to the hedging of business-related dollar risk
are as follows

¢ $2,985 million, the amount of financial instruments hedging net firm
commitments (US dollar risk against the euro, Canadian dollar and
pound sterling) at 31 December 2016 compared with $3,309 milion
at 31 December 2015;

¢ $310 million, the amount of financial instruments hedging bids in
US dollars against the euro, Canadian dollar and pound stetling at
31 December 2016 compared to $124 million at 31 December 2015

Operating receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency
are exchange-rate hedged and therefore not exposed to currency risk.

The change in value of financial instruments (forward transactions) used
as cash flow hedges is recognised in shareholders’ equity. A decrease
(increase) of 5% in the US dollar compared to the euro, pound sterling

Management report — 2016 Financial Information

and Canadian dollar, would have increased (decreased) shareholders’
equity by approximately €153 million at 31 December 2016 and
31 December 2015. The premium/discount component is not eligible to
cash flow hedge accounting and is recognised through profit and loss
In 2016, the change in market value of the premium/discount was
a negative €54.0 million (compared to a negative €15.5 million
in 2015}

The change in value of financial instruments matched with portfolios of
sales offers which are not eligible for hedge accounting is recognised
in profit and loss. A decrease (increase) of 5% in the US dollar
compared to the euro, pound sterling and Canadian dollar, would
have had no impact at 31 December 2016 and would have increased
(decreased) income by approximately €1 million at 31 December 2015

Foreign currency-denominated financial debt does not generate any
exposure in profit and loss, as it is either denominated in the functional
currency of the entity in which it is recognised, or is used as a net
foreign investment hedge.

b) Management of risks relating to foreign
currency-denominated assets

The Group may hedge a portion of its foreign currency-denominated
assets, mainly those likely to be disposed of at a future date. The main
criteria for determining whether or not a given foreign currency
denominated asset should be hedged are as follows

the nature of the business operations involved;

e the structure of Thales’ commitment with respect to jointly held
companies, in particular the specific features of the shareholders’
agreement in each joint venture.

The actual application of this policy also depends on

e the objective of optimising hedges in light of market conditions
(availability of foreign currency, interest rates, hedging rate, etc.);

the risks inherent in the future value of the assets being hedged and
the nature of the business of the corresponding subsidiaries.

1.1.2.3.4 Shares

Thales was not exposed to any significant equity risk at end-2016,
excluding the risk on treasury shares.

At 31 December 2016, Thales held 749,559 treasury shares,
representing 0.35% of the share capital

1.1.2.3.5 Pension commitments

Defined-benefit pension plans are in place for certain Group
employees, mainly in the UK, which are financed by the Group under
the provisions of the applicable national legislation. As such, at
31 December 2016, Thales’ pension commitments in the United Kingdom
amounted to €4,605.7 million, hedged by €3,246.2 million
in investments, representing an underlying shortfall of €1,359.5 million

Changing market parameters can lead to a substantial increase or
decrease in the amount of the shortfall and the annual costs of
defined-benefit plans. At 31 December 2016, the sensitivity factors
were as follows

a reduction or increase in the discount rate applied to liabilities,
which could increase or reduce the underlying shortfall; this variable
is partly offset by changes in the value of fixed-rate hedging bonds
held as plan assets and interest rate swaps;

e changes in the total return on investments in equities and other
assets;

changes in the forecast inflation rate;
© a substantial change in mortality tables;

exchange rate fluctuations [mainly sterling against the euro}

2016 Registration Document — THALES 23


--- Page 17 ---

information — Management report

Thales has introduced quarterly reporting on its pension plan positions
and makes regular projections measuring the sensitivity of underlying
shortfalls to possible changes in market parameters taking into account
correlation factors. In the UK, Thales plan assets are managed
by trustees in accordance with the applicable regulations and in
consultation with the Group. Plan assets are allocated with regard to
the long-term maturity of the commitments they cover.

Additional information on the amount of commitments and the annual
costs linked to pension and other employee benefits, as well as the
valuation and allocation of plan assets and the sensitivity of net
commitments to different actuarial assumptions is given in Note 9.3
of the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2016.

1.1.2.3.6 Customer credit

Credit risk relates to the risk that a party to a contract will default on its
commitments or fail to pay what it owes.

a) Risk of default by private sector customers

Non-governmental customers (aircraft manufacturers, airlines, private
infrastructure operators and industry) account for approximately 25% of
Thales’ sales. These customers may encounter major and/or prolonged
financial difficulties that could lead to payment defaults or order
cancellations. Such occurrences could have a negative impact on
Thales’ sales, profitability and financial position

To mitigate these risks, Thales conducts regular analyses of the ability of
customers to meet their obligations. When necessary, Thales may
request bank guarantees or corporate guarantees, or may use credit
insurers.

b) Credit risk relating to public sector customers

Public, government and institutional customers account for around 75%
of Thales’ sales. Thales works with a large number of countries. Some
of them could present a significant credit risk which could, for example,
lead them to suspend an order in production, or render them unable to
pay on delivery, as agreed under the terms of the contract. To limit its
exposure to these risks, Thales takes out insurance with export credit
agencies (such as BPIFrance] or private insurers

At 31 December 2016, only three customers accounted for annual sales
in excess of €500 million: the French State (around €2.5 billion), the
UK government (around €1 billion) and the Australian government
(around €0.6 billion). At 31 December 2016, these three countries had
first-class or high-quality ratings (France was rated AA by S&P and Aa2
by Moody's, the United Kingdom was rated AA by S&P and Aal by
Moody's, and Australia was rated AAA by S&P and Aaa by Moody's)

1.1.2.4

Thales’ Insurance and Risk Management department, based at head
office and reporting to the SEVP Finance & Information Systems,
is responsible for the Group's insurance activities and insurable tisk
management. It is in charge of Group operations and oversees policy
implementation by Group companies.

Insurance

The Group covers the financial consequences of the risk of accidental
damage suffered or caused by property or people using appropriate
insurance policies with leading international insurance and reinsurance
companies.

The insurance policies arranged by the Group to cover these major risks
relate to areas such as

¢ damage to property and consequent operating losses;
transport;
¢ assembling and testing;

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

civil aviation liability, including civil ibility for aeronautical products
and hull/test flight insurance;

civil liability for space products;

risks of damage to or by naval vessels by subsidiaries, as nava
equipment suppliers;

general third-party liability;

environmental liability;

liability of executive officers and directors;

individual accident — repatriation assistance for employees on
assignment

Whilst certain harmful events were notified to insurers, the Group had
no major loss in 2016

Thales’ policy is to arrange cover on the insurance market based on the
tates and limits that it considers reasonable, in view of the conditions
offered by the market. Limits are applicable to insurance for major risks,
while general exclusions for the entire market (e.g., asbestos} also apply
to Thales.

In 2016, the maximum coverage limit for insurance against damage to
property and consequent operating losses was €1.3 billion. This limit
takes into account the estimated maximum possible loss caused to an
industrial site which the Group could incur in this regard. In 2016, the
Group took out specific cover against cyber incidents and damages
that could compromise its internal IT systems.

Levels of liability cover depend on the quantification of a reasonable
claim expectancy for Thales, as identified by the risk map of the main
business activities and at Group level, and on cover capacity available
on the insurance market. The insurance coverage for civil aviation
liability commitments, which is covered by a specific programme,
amounts to $2 billion

The insurance industry depends on the financial markets. There are
therefore no guarantees that Thales will be able to maintain current
levels of insurance under similar financial conditions in the future

In order to reduce its exposure to insurance market volatility, Thales
insures major risks on a two-tier basis:

e the Group's contribution, through captive insurance and reinsurance
companies, towards the settlement of claims, to a maximum net
retention of €12 million per year, for damage to property and
consequent operating losses, Transport, general third-party liability,
assembling and testing, development and space risks;

© transfer to insurers of payment for catastrophic losses.

In parallel, an active Prevention and Protection policy for industrial sites
is designed to reduce the magnitude and frequency of the accidental
risks of fire or explosion and to detect other exposures, such as
environmental or natural disasters and the vulnerability of critical
industrial facilities. In 2016, more than 66% of the assets insured were
the subject of a “multi peril” audit by the insurers during their visits to the
principal operating sites and infrared thermography inspections by an
outside organisation specialised in the prevention of electrical damage.

In accordance with Group processes, measures were taken fo minimise
business interruption and the consequences of any unforeseen events.
An organisational structure and crisis management tools are in place to
deal as efficiently as possible with the immediate consequences of a
catastrophic event and to take the necessary emergency measures.

A tisk prevention policy for critical supplier sites was also set in place to
reduce the risk of operating losses for Thales in the event of an
accidental disaster at one of their sites

Furthermore, Thales continues to roll out an insurance policy for its staff
to cover them in the context of their professional activity. Lastly, specific
and/or local cover has been arranged to comply with the regulations in
force and to satisfy the specific requirements of certain business
activities or projects, particularly public-private partnerships.

2016 Financial Information — Consolidated financial statements

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FRAMEWORK

Thales’ consolidated financial statements for the year ended

1 December 2016 were approved and authorised for issue by its
Board of Directors on 27 February 2017. In accordance with French
legislation, the financial statements will be deemed to be definitive
once they have been adopted by the shareholders of the Group
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2017.

1.1
statements
Thales’ consolidated financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
approved by the European Union at 31 December 2016

These accounting policies, described in Note 14, are consistent with
those applied by the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015

Thales (parent company) is a French joint-stock company (société
anonyme) registered with the Nanterre Trade and Companies’ Register
under number 552 059 024.

Furthermore, the new standards that were mandatory from | January
2016 (2010-2012 Annual Improvements Cycle, 2012-2014 Annual
Improvements Cycle, and the amendments to IAS 16, IAS 38, IAS 19
and IFRS 11) have no impact on the Group's financial statements.

1.2 New standards effective from 31 December 2016

The following standards have been adopted by the IASB and will be effective for the periods indicated below pending their adoption by the

European Union

[a] Clarifications to IFRS 15 stil in progress.

The assessment of the potential impacts of these new standards for the
Group's consolidated financial statements is underway.

Thales Group has a dedicated project team responsible for analysing
the differences between IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with
Customers} and existing standards (IAS 18 — Revenue and IAS 1] -
Construction Contracts} which continued to carefully monitor the possible
implications for the Aerospace and Defence sectors throughout 2016.

In particular, the new standard provides for:

© the unbundling of multiple performance obligations within a single
contract;

the recognition of revenue based on the transfer of control of goods
and services to the customer: this transfer can occur at a given point
in time or over time;

new criteria proving the transfer of control over time and allowing
for the recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion
method. For the vast majority of Group construction contracts, Thales
must be able to demonstrate that the goods sold have no alternative
use and that it has an irrevocable right to payment for the work
performed to date in the case of termination for convenience by the
customer;

appropriate methods to determine the stage of completion of
contracts (or of each performance obligation). In this respect,
the Group is currently assessing the implications of switching to the
cost to cost method

The Group will comment on the impacts of IFRS 15 in the second half
of 2017 and confirm its choice in respect of the transition method

1.4 Main sources of estimates

The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements
involves making estimates and assumptions, which have an impact on
the valuation of the Group's performance and its consolidated assets
and liabilities. These estimates are based on past experience and factor
in the economic conditions prevailing at the end of the reporting period
and any information available as of the date on which the financial
statements are prepared.

In today’s global economic environment, the degree of volatility and
subsequent lack of visibility are particularly high. Future facts and
circumstances could lead to changes in these estimates or assumptions
which would affect the Group's financial situation, profit and loss and
cash flows, notably with regard to:

Construction contracts (Note 10.1)

The recognition of income and expenses relating to construction
contracts is based on estimates of the overall profit or loss on their
completion (see Note 14-c). These estimates are performed by project
managers under the supervision of General Management and in
accordance with Group procedures

Goodwill (Note 4.1)

Goodwill is subject to impairment tests. The recoverable amount of
goodwill is assessed based on forecast data from the strategic plans
prepared in accordance with Group procedures. Sensitivity tests are
carried out on key assumptions which lend greater weight to the
conclusions reached.

Development costs (Note 4.2)

Development costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation (Note 14-e}
are recognised as intangible assets and amortised over their useful

lives. Compliance with the criteria is assessed in line with forecast
activity and the profitability of the corresponding projects.

Pensions and other long-term employee benefits (Note 9.3)

Pensions and other long-term employee benefit commitments are
estimated on statistical and actuarial bases in accordance with the
policies outlined in the Note 14-j. Actuarial assumptions made by the
Group (discount rates, inflation rate, mortality tables, etc.) are reviewed
each year with the Group's actuaries

Deferred tax assets (Note 7)

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carryforwards and
temporary differences between the book value and the tax value of
assets and liabilities. Recovery of these assets is assessed on the basis
of the forecast data in the strategic plans of each of the tax groups
considered, and generally over a period of five years

Litigation (Note 12)

The Group regularly identifies and reviews litigation in progress and
recognises the accounting provisions that it considers to be reasonable
in light of the circumstances. Any uncertainties concerning litigation in
progress are described in Note 12

Purchase price allocation in respect of business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with the
purchase accounting method described in Note 14-b: on the date of
the takeover of a company, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value. These
valuations are performed by independent experts who base their work
‘on assumptions and estimate the effects of future events, which are
uncertain at the acquisition date.

NOTE 2. SEGMENT INFORMATION

2.1 Information by

business segment

The operational segments presented by the Group are as follows:

e the Aerospace segment, which combines the “Avionics” and
"Space" Global Business Units that develop on-board systems,
solutions and services, mainly for private sector customers (aircraft
manufacturers, airlines, satellite operators, etc.) but also to a lesser
extent for government/defence customers states, space agencies
and other semi-public organisations};

the Transport segment, which comprises the “Ground Transportation
Systems” Global Business Unit that develops systems and services
for an exclusively civilian customer base of ground transportation
infrastructure operators;

e the Defence and Security segment, which combines the “Secure
Communications and Information Systems”, “Land and Air Systems"
and “Defence Mission Systems” Global Business Units that develop
equipment, systems and services for the armed and security forces
and for the protection of networks and infrastructures, mainly for a
government/defence customer base.

In order to monitor the operating and financial performance of the
Group entities, the Group's executives regularly consider certain key
non-GAAP indicators as defined in Note 14-a, which enable them to
exclude certain non-operating and non-recurring items.

In particular, EBIT, presented by business segment below, corresponds
to income from operations plus the share in net income of equity
affiliates, excluding amortisation of acquisiton-related intangible assets
[purchase price allocation - PPA) reported under business
combinations. From 1 January 2016, it also excludes other expenses
booked to income from operations that are directly linked to business
combinations, which are unusual by nature.

NOTE 3. IMPACT OF CHANGES IN SCOPE

OF CONSOLIDATION

3.1 Main changes in scope

of consolidation

In 2016:

e At the end of March 2016, Thales finalised the acquisition of
Vormetric, a leading provider of data protection solutions for a total
of $408 million (€372.4 million). Vormetric has been consolidated
since its acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to
amortisable intangible assets in the amount of $243.6 million
{technology and customer relationships acquired) net of a deferred
tax liability of $85.3 million. Residual goodwill amounted
to €208.1 million (€189.9 million).

As part of the transaction, Thales signed compensation agreements
with key managers subject to their remaining with the company until
2020. The related amounts are being taken to income on a
straight-line basis in tranches over the vesting period

These amounts are recognised in income from operations, but
excluded from EBIT as they concern an event that is unusual nature
(€19 million in 2016, Note 2.1)

e Atthe end of June 2016, Thales signed an agreement with Raytheon
to reduce the scope of their joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems,
which specialises in control systems and air operation command,
surveillance radars, and ground-based weapon-locating radars
As of | July 2016, the scope of this joint venture extends only to
NATO customers and programmes.

As part of the agreement, Thales acquired Raytheon’s non-
controlling interest in French company TRS SAS and sold its stake in
US company TRS LLC to Raytheon. Taken together, these
transactions resulted in a net gain of $90 million (€81 million) in
Thales’ consolidated financial statements.

In Thales’ consolidated financial statements, the acquisition of
Raytheon’s non-controlling interest in TRS SAS led to a
reclassification in equity. The disposal of the interest in TRS LLC
resulted in a disposal gain of €91.8 million. Thales-Raytheon
Systems Air and Missile Defense Command remains jointly owned
by the Group and is accounted for under the equity method

e In October 2016, Thales sold its interest in Hanwha Thales,
a jointly-owned company that specialises in defence electronics in
Korea, for €204.4 million. The disposal gain recognised in the
consolidated financial statements amounted to €113.8 million

e In mid-November 2016, Thales entered into exclusive negotiations
to sell its payment collection and road toll and car park
management systems business. The transaction was still in progress
at the closing date.

In 2015:

© In August 2015, Thales sold its 30% stake in ESG Elektroniksystem-
und Logistik GmbH to Munich investment holding for €75.2 million.
The disposal gain recognised in the consolidated financial
statements amounted to €47.2 million.

[o} Goodwill on Vormetric after purchase price allocation
[b}_ Allocation of goodwill of cyber securiiy and communication security activites.

b) Impairment tests The assumptions used concern growth in sales and terminal values and
are based on reasonable estimations in line with specific data
available for each business secior (generally, terminal value is based on
the average income from operations over the three years of the strategic

plan, with growth capped at 2%).

At end-2016, the overall value in use of the Group CGUs was higher
than its carrying amount.

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
Group's budgetary timetable. Value in use is determined on the basis of
discounted future operating cash flows over a three-year period and a
terminal value. This calculation is based on data from the strategic plans
prepared in accordance with Group procedures. In certain specific cases
(recent acquisitions, non-typical annual results, etc.), the terminal value

is determined based on forecasts over an appropriate period of time c) Sensitivity of values in use

At end-2016 and end-2015, impairment tests were performed with the

initial assumption of a 8.5% discount rate for all CGUs (each of which
presented a similar degree of risk given that the specific CGU tisks are
factored into forecasts)

The Group also tests the sensitivty of values in use based on reasonable
key assumptions. At the end of 2016, a 1% increase in the discount
rate, a 1% decrease in the growth rate or a 2% decrease in operating
profitability of the Group CGUs would not require any additional
impairments

Receivables, payables and refundable grants as detailed in the
Note 10.1, are financial assets and liabilities within the meaning of
IAS 32/39 and are measured at amortised cost.

IFRS 13 categorises valuation techniques for each financial asset and
liability according to a fair value hierarchy with three levels:

e level 1: valuation is based on quoted (non adjusted) prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities;

level 2: valuation is based on information other than quoted market
prices that is observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly;

e level 3: valuation is based on unobservable information for an asset

or liability

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised
cost approximates their carrying amount.

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

The fair value of bond debt is based on quoted prices [level 1). The fair
value of other borrowings and debt is determined for each loan by
discounting the expected future cash flows at the Euribor interest rate
at the closing date, adjusted for the Group's credit risk (level 2)

The fair value of monetary and non-monetary UCITS is measured
based on the last known net asset value. The fair value of interest rate
products (certificates of deposit, short-term deposits, negotiable
medium-term notes, etc.) is based on the discounting of coupons flows
(nominal and interest) over the remaining life of the product at the
closing date. The discount rate used is the market rate corresponding
to the maturity and product characteristics.

The fair value of derivatives is based on models commonly used to
measure these financial instruments (models including observable
market data). Counterparty defaut risk and credit risk have no material
impact on the fair value of derivatives.

6.5 Financial risk

Consolidated financial statements — 2016 Financial Information

Thales’ financial risk management policy is described in detail in the Group management report (section 1.1.2}

a) Market risk

Thales hedges its foreign exchange and interest-rate risk using over-the-counter derivatives from tier-one banks. The book value of derivatives used to

manage the Group's market risk is presented below:

Foreign exchange risk

Thales hedges currency risks arising in connection with the negotiation of contracts denominated in currencies other than the main production
currency, currency risks generated by ordinary commercial operations, risks relating to cash pooling and, in some cases, risks relating to its net

investments in foreign operations

At 31 December 2015 and 2016, the amount of derivatives in the portfolio can be analysed as follows:

Interest-rate risk

Thales is exposed to interest-rate volatility and in particular its impact on the conditions associated with variable-rate financing. To limit this risk,
Thales operates an active interest-rate hedging policy. At 31 December 2015 and 2016, the amount of derivatives in the portfolio was as follows:

b) Customer credit risk

Credit risk relates to the risk that a party to a contract will default on its
commitments or fail to pay what it owes.

Risk of default by private sector customers

Non-governmental customers (aircraft manufacturers, airlines, private
infrastructure operators and industry) account for approximately 25% of
Thales’ sales. These customers may encounter major and/or prolonged
financial difficulties that could lead to payment defaults or order
cancellations. Such occurrences could have a negative impact on
Thales’ sales, profitability and financial position

To mitigate these risks, Thales conducts regular analyses of the ability of
customers to meet their obligations. When necessary, Thales may request
bank guarantees or corporate guarantees, or may use credit insurers.

Consolidated financial statements — 2016 Financial Information

Credit risk relating to public sector customers

Public, government and institutional customers account for around 75%
of Thales’ sales. Thales works with a large number of countries. Some
of them could present a significant credit risk which could, for example,
lead them to suspend an order in production, or render them unable to
pay on delivery, as agreed under the terms of the contract. To limit its
exposure to these risks, Thales takes out insurance with export credit
agencies (such as BPIFrance] or private insurers

At 31 December 2016, only three customers accounted for annual sales
in excess of €500 million: the French State (around €2.5 billion), the
UK government (around €1 billion) and the Australian government
(around €0.6 billion). At 31 December 2016, these three countries had
first-class or high-quality ratings (France was rated AA by S&P and Aa2
by Moody's, the United Kingdom was rated AA by S&P and Aal by
Moody’s, and Australia was rated AAA by S&P and Aaa by Moody's)

The Group's Finance department consolidates all the information relating to the Group's exposure to credit risk, notably by identifying and analysing
the ageing of overdue accounts and notes receivable that have not been impaired. At 31 December 2016 and 2015, the ageing of these accounts

and notes receivable is as follows:

31/12/2016 Total ‘Accounts and notes receivables past due
Less than 3 to 6 months More than
3 months 6 months

Overdue accounts and notes receivables not impaired

Credit risk related to banking counterparties
Financial investments are diversified. They relate to first ranking debt
and are negotiated with tier-one banks

Thales Group trades over-the-counter derivatives with tier-one banks
under agreements which provide for the offseting of amounts payable

and receivable in the event of default by one of the contracting parties.
These conditional offsetting agreements do not meet the eligibility
criteria within the meaning of IAS 32 for offsetting derivative instruments
recorded under assets and liabilities. However, they do fall within the
scope of disclosures under IFRS 7 on offsetting

¢) Liquidity risk

The Group's liquidity risk is the risk of it being unable to meet its cash
needs out of its financial resources. In particular, it relates to Thales’
level of exposure to changes in the main market indicators that could
lead to an increase in the cost of credit or even to a temporary
limitation of access to external sources of financing,

The Group manages this risk by trying to anticipate its cash needs and
ensures that these are covered by the Group's short-term and long-term
financial resources, as follows

e shareholders’ equity (Note 8.1);

¢ gross debt (listed by date of maturity in Note 6.2);

e committed, undrawn credit facilities granted by banks
(€1,500 million maturing in 2021) as backup to the commercial
paper programme and acting as a financing reserve.

The parent company’s financing programmes are rated by
Standard & Poor's and Moody's. At the date of publication, Thales’
credit risk ratings were as follows:

NOTE 7. INCOME TAX

Moody's Standard

& Poor's
Medium & long-term loans A2 A
Outlook Stable Stable
Commercial paper & short-term loans Prime-1 A2

The decrease of Thales’ credit risk rating would not trigger the financial
covenants included in its financing contracts. The single accelerated
repayment clause would apply only in the event that the French State
ceased to hold its golden share and, simultaneously, the ratio of
consolidated net debt to EBITDA" were to exceed 3x.

A lower rating would result in an increase (capped) in the margins
applicable to the €1.5 billion committed credit facility. A higher rating
would lead to a decrease in the applicable margin (with a minimum
threshold). No other financing arrangements are subject to covenants
based on financial ratios.

The income tax charge takes into account specific local tax rules, including the tax consolidation systems in France and the United States, group

relief in the United Kingdom and Organschaf rules in Germany,

The weighted average rate corresponds to the sum of theoretical taxes
of consolidated companies, divided by the consolidated net income
before tax and the share in net income of equity affiliates
The theoretical tax of each consolidated company corresponds to net
income before tax at the local tax rate.

Accordingly, the average tax rate reflects the relative contribution of the
different countries to consolidated net income. France, which has a tax
rate of 34.43% before additional contributions, represented almost
70% of income before tax in both 2016 and 2015

and jobs (crédit d‘impét pour la compétitivité et l'emploi - CICE)
recognised in operating income;

e the tax advantages related to research, which are recognised in
income tax (notably in Australia and the Netherlands).

Taxes excluded from the average tax rate mainly include state taxes in
the United States, taxes on foreign establishments, and the additional

e) Reserves for cash flow hedge

The Group uses foreign exchange derivatives to hedge against changes in the value of future cash flows related to commercial cash flows in foreign
currencies. In the consolidated financial statements, the effective portion of changes in fair value of these derivatives is recognised directly in equity,
until such time as the hedged flows affect profit and loss

2016 2015

[a] A negative balance at closing means that the exchange rates of the derivative instruments documented as hedges are generally less favorable than the exchange rates prevailing at

the closing date.

benefits (long-service and jubilee awards, etc.)

a) Description of the plans

The Group's existing plans are either defined contribution plans or
defined benefit plans

Defined contribution plans

In certain countries, the Group pays contributions based on salaries to
state organisations in charge of basic pension schemes |e.g., Sécurité
sociale or compulsory supplementary schemes ARRCO and AGIRC in
France}. Beyond these basic pension schemes, Thales also contributes
to other defined contribution plans (e.g., Netherlands and United
Kingdom since 2002). These plans do not impose any other
obligations on the Group except for the payment of contributions: there
is no related benefit obligation and contributions are expensed in the
period they are incurred

d) Actuarial assumptions used

The actuarial assumptions used are determined according to the economic environment and specific criteria of each country and each system

The most sensitive assumptions are as follows:

2016 UK France 2015 UK France
Inflation rate 3.22% 1.40% Inflation rate 3.02% 1.60%
Discount rate 2.79% 1.50% Discount rate 3.96% 2.03%
Average duration of the plans 17 years 10 years ~— Average duration of the plans 17 years ‘11 years

For each country, the discount rates are obtained by reference to the Iboxx
Corporate AA index which reflects the rate of return of very high-quality
corporate bonds, with maturity dates equivalent to the duration of the
plans being measured, and in the same currency.

The difference in assumptions between 2015 and 2016 (decrease in
the discount rate and increase in inflation), is due to the climate of
uncertainty generated by the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom

At 31 December 2016, the sensitivity of the net obligation to a change in the discount rate is as follows:

Sensitivity in basis points +0.25%

0.25%

+0.50% -0.50% +1% -1%

256.9

Dectease (increase) in provision (in € millions)

(273.0)

498.5 (564.6) 939.0 (1,205.0)

In the United Kingdom, a 25-basis-point increase in the inflation rate would lead to a €129.8 million increase in the obligation. Conversely,
a 25-basis-point decrease in the inflation rate would give rise to a €112.6 million decrease in the obligation

e) Allocation and return on plan assets

Plan assets generated an actual average return of 14% in 2016,
compared with 4% in 2015. At 31 December 2016, the allocation of
assets, mainly invested in the United Kingdom, breaks down as follows

2016 2015
Fixed-rate bonds 32% 36%
Index-linked investments 13% 1%
Equities 33% 31%
Alternative liquid investments 8% %
Alternative non-liquid
investments (property, etc.) 14% 12%
Cash - 1%
TOTAL 100% 100%
f) Funding

Thales is subject to funding obligations in respect of its defined benefit
pension commitments in the United Kingdom.

In accordance with the regulations in force, the level of funding for its
pension obligation is remeasured every three years, further to which the
suitability of a new funding plan and/or the implementation
of guarantees for the plan is decided in consultation with the trustees.
The latest measurement, based on the situation at end-2014, was
finalised in September 2016 and led to an annual contribution of
£60 million to the main Thales UK Pension Scheme (£6 million for other
schemes}.

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

Depending on changes in the degree of deficit increase or decrease],
future contributions to the main scheme could range between
£45 million and £75 million

Thales UK Holding has also guaranteed the future liabilities linked to the
funding plan for the subsidiaries concerned in the United Kingdom
At 31 December 2016, the balance of the guarantee of £858.9 milion
will be reduced by any sums paid. This guarantee is underwritten by
Thales for €974 million

9.4 Share-based payment
At 31 December 2016, the following options, shares and units were
outstanding

e 40,850 share purchase options with a weighted average exercise
price of €44.64;

© 1,320,693 share subscription options with a weighted average
exercise price of €36.01, including 236,472 performance shares;

© 859,445 free shares, including 374,405 performance shares;

NOTE 10. CURRENT OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Current operating assets and liabilities include working capital
components and reserves for contingencies. The changes in these items
are presented below.

Contracts falling within the scope of IAS 11 are subject to specific
classification in the consolidated balance sheet: for each contract, the
balance of unbilled receivables, work in progress and reserves for
contingencies are presented in assets or liabilities under “Construction
contracts” (Note 14-c}

The Group is authorised to assign trade receivables, mainly from the
French State, and commercial paper. At 31 December 2016,

derecognised receivables amounted to €130.3 million (€103.7 million
at 31 December 2015]. The organic change in derecognised
receivables represents an increase of €21.1 million for 2016
(a decrease of €126.3 milion in 2015}

As these assignements without recourse in case of default by the debtor
involve the transfer of substantially all corresponding risks and rewards,
they are derecognised. Thales’ continued involvement (within the
meaning of IFRS 7) in the related risks and rewards corresponds to the
share of dilution risk not transferred to the bank and the remuneration
received under the recovery mandate.

10.4 Bonds and warranties
linked to commercial
contracts

In the ordinary course of its activities, the Group regularly responds to
invitations to tender. When requested by the customer, bid bonds are
delivered in order to demonstrate the definitive nature of the bid and
to indemnify the customer if the Group fails to meet its commitments.
At 31 December 2016, bid bonds issued amounted to €26.2 million
(€66.2 million at 31 December 2015)

From the signature of a contract up until its completion, the Group may
also issue performance bonds for its customers, with a bank acting as

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

an intermediary, in order to cover the payment of damages to the
customer in the event that the Group does not meet its contractual
commitments. At 31 December 2016, performance bonds amounted
to €2,288.6 million (€2,038.6 million at 31 December 2015}

Technical, operational and financial costs incurred by the Group in
order to meet its obligations are valued, on a contract-by-contract
basis, and are included in the cost to completion of the contract.
Where this is not the case, a provision is set aside in the consolidated
financial statements for any potential risk, estimated on a contract-by-
contract basis

In order to finance contract execution, the Group may receive advance
payments from its customers, in accordance with contractual terms,
which are recognised in liabilities in the balance sheet. In order to


--- Page 56 ---

guarantee reimbursement of these advance payments if the contractual
obligations are not met, the Group may deliver, at the customer's
request, an advance payment bond. At 31 December 2016, advance
payment bonds amounted to €2,336.7 million (€2,183.4 million at
31 December 2015)

The maturity dates of these commitments are:

Consolidated financial statements — 2016 Financial Information

The Group evaluates and sets aside provisions for warranty costs in
order to guarantee the conformity of goods sold to the customer during
the contractual warranty period. In most cases, the provisional
withholding of payment contractually applying during this period can
be replaced by a warranty retention bond using a bank as
intermediary. At 31 December 2016, warranty retention bonds amount
to €114.9 million (€115.2 million at 31 December 2015).

The awarding of major contracts, particularly within the defence sector,
may be subject to local or regulatory offsetting obligations, which can
take the form of direct offsetting, semi-direct offsetting or indirect
offsetting. The associated risks are described under “tisk factors” in the
management report.

NOTE 11. CASH FLOWS

Parent company guarantees

In addition, Thales may grant parent company guarantees to third
parties in support of its subsidiaries’ obligations without using a bank as
an intermediary. At 31 December 2016, these guarantees amounted
to €13,697.1 million (€14,688.3 million at 31 December 2015)

These guarantees include all commitments given on behalf of Thales
Alenia Space, which are backed by a counterguarantee from Leonardo
in proportion to its interest in the capital of Thales Alenia Space (33%),

NOTE 12. LITIGATION

Due to the nature of its business activities, Thales is exposed to the risk
of technical and commercial litigation

To prevent disputes or limit their impact, Thales’ policy is to systematically
seek alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This policy is reviewed
‘on a regular basis to take into account changes in the Group's core
areas of business and is backed by employee training programmes.

In addition, Thales implemented a procedure several years ago to
centralise all civil commercial and criminal litigation and claims. These
are handled by the Corporate legal Affairs department, with the
support of the Group companies involved

At the end of 2002, a group of French manufacturers, including Thales
and one of its subsidiaries, collectively received a request for arbitration
from a shared customer claiming an amount which allegedly should be
no less than $260 million and for which the group of French

manufacturers might be jointly liable towards the claimant. This request
for arbitration is related to the execution of old contracts by the group of
French manufacturers. Pursuant fo an agreement signed by all of the
parties in June 2003, the claimant withdrew its request for arbitration

In November 2012, the claimant filed a new request for arbitration for
a revised amount of €226 million of which Thales’ share would be
around 28% of the amount claimed. The manufacturers are strongly
disputing this demand and at this date it is not possible to evaluate any
potential financial risk. Accordingly, Thales has not set aside a provision
in respect of this dispute. Proceedings are ongoing

There are no other government, judicial or arbitration claims of which
the Group is aware, which are pending or threatened and which could
have or have had, any significant effect on the financial position or
profitability of the Company and/or the Group in the last 12 months

NOTE 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

To the best of the Group's knowledge, no significant events occurred after the end of the reporting period

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

Consolidated financial statements — 2016 Financial Information

NOTE 14. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a) Presentation of the financial statements

Consolidated profit and loss account
Expenses in the income statement are presented analytically by destination.

Income from operations is equal to income of operating activities before
taking into account:

© gains and losses on disposal of disposals of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets, businesses or investments;

the impact of changes in scope on consolidated net income (Note 14-b};

¢ the impact of the amendment, curtailment or liquidation of pension
plans and other long-term benefits;

the impairment of non-current operating assets;

¢ other operating income [expense] resulting from events that are
unusual by their frequency, nature and amount.

Consolidated balance sheet

A significant portion of the Group's activities in its different business
segments have long-term operating cycles. Accordingly, assets
(liabilities) that are usually realised (settled) within the entities’ operating
cycles [inventory, accounts receivable and payable, advances,
reserves, etc.) are classified in the consolidated balance sheet as
current assets and liabilities, with no distinction between the amounts
due within one year and those due after one year

Consolidated statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows provides an analysis of the change in cash
and cash equivalents, as presented in the balance sheet and defined in
Note 14-h. The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect
method based on consolidated net income and is broken down into
three categories:

net cash flow from operating activities (including interest and taxes};

e net cash flow used in investing activities, including net operating
investments (acquisition and disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets, capitalisation of development
costs) and net financial investments;

«net cash flow used in financing activities including dividends paid,
from capital subscriptions (exercise of options by employees}, the
purchase/sale of treasury shares, the issuance and repayment of
debt, and changes in bank overdrafts, etc.

The Group also presents the changes in its net cash, which is a non-GAAP
measure and includes gross debt, net of cash and cash equivalents and
liquid investments. Changes in net cash, presented in Note 11.1,
notably reflect Free operating cash flow, defined as net cash flow from
operating activites less net operating investments, plus the payment of
the UK pension deficits.

Adjusted net income

In order to monitor and compare its operating and financial
performances, the Group presents the following key indicators:

EBIT, corresponding to income from operations plus the share in net
income of equity affiliates minus the amortisation of acquired intangible
assets (purchase price allocation — PPA) recorded when significant
businesses are combined. From | January 2016, it also excludes the
other expenses recognised in current operationnal result that are directly
related to business combinations, and which are unusual by nature.

Adjusted net income is regarded as pertinent by the Group as it
excludes non-recurring items. It corresponds to consolidated net income
attributable to shareholders of the parent company, less the following
items, net of the corresponding tax impacts

¢ amortisation of acquired intangible assets (PPA);
other expenses recognised in current operational result that are directly
related to business combinations, and which are unusual by nature;

«disposal of assets, changes in scope of consolidation and other;

© changes in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments,
recognised in “Other financial income";
actuarial gains and losses on long-term employee benefits, included
in “financial income on pensions and other employee benefits”

Adjusted net income per share corresponds to the adjusted net income
attributable to shareholders of the parent company, divided by the
average number of shares outstanding during the period concerned

Off-balance sheet commitments

Disclosures regarding off-balance sheet commitments are presented
in the following notes:

e Note 4.3: lease commitments;
Note 9.3-f: pension commitments;
Note 10.4: commercial contract commitments.

Related parties

The Group has identified the following related parties: shareholders of
Thales (parent company], notably the French State and Dassault
Aviation, companies controlled by these shareholders, companies
under joint control or significant influence, Directors and Senior
Corporate Officers.

Section 4.3.3.3 of the 2015 Registration Document describes the main
provisions concerning the shareholders’ agreement governing relations
between the French State (“public sector") and Dassault Aviation
(‘Industrial Pariner”) within Thales, the convention on the protection of
national strategic interests and the specific convention binding the State
and Thales

Information related to transactions with related parties is presented
in the following notes:

e sales with the French State [mainly with DGA: French defence
procurement agency) in Note 6.5-b;

transactions with companies under joint control and their joint
shareholders in Note 5.1-e.

Transactions with other related parties are not material

Expenses recognised in respect of compensation, benefits and social
security contributions attributable to Directors and members of the
Executive Committee are presented in Note 9.5

b) Scope of consolidation and changes i

scope

Scope of consolidation

The financial statements of material subsidiaries directly or indirectly
controlled by Thales are fully consolidated. The financial statements
of material subsidiariesjointly controlled by Thales(joint ventures) or in
which the Group has significant influence {associates} are accounted
for under the equity method

Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method as
described in IFRS 3. Under this method, the Group recognises identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value on their acquisition
date. It also recognises non-controlling interests in an acquiree on their
acquisition date:

Non-controlling interests are measured either at fair value or proportionate
to the share of the identifiable net assets. This is determined on a
case-by-case by the Group depending on the option it wishes to apply.

Acquisition-related costs (valuation fees, consulting fees, etc.) are
recognised under “other operating expenses” as incurred

Negative goodwill is immediately recognised in “other operating
income (expenses}". Positive goodwill related to controlled companies

2016 Registration Document — THALES

65


--- Page 59 ---

information — Consolidated financial statements

is recognised in balance sheet assets under intangible assets. Positive
goodwill related to equity affiliates is recognised under “share in net
assets of equityaffiliates”

Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to impairment tests each year.
Goodwill impairment is booked as an expense under “impairment of
non-current operating assets” and may not be reversed. Goodwill
impairment related to equity affiliates is recognised in “share in net
income of equity affiliates’ and may be reversed

c) Revenue recognition

The Group's sales can be divided into two main accounting categories:
sales of goods and services, and construction contracts.

Sales are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable. When the deferral of payment has a material effect on the
determination of fair value, the amount at which sales are recognised is
adjusted to take the financial impact of the deferral of payment into
account

Sales of goods and services

Income from the sales of goods and services together with royalty and
licence income are recognised when future economic benefits are likely
to flow to the Group and when the amount of sales can be measured
reliably. The following specific criteria must also be satisfied in order for
sales to be recognised

@ income from the sale of goods is recognised when the Company
has transferred the principal risks and rewards inherent to ownership
of the goods to the purchaser;

© income from services rendered is recognised according to the
percentage-of-completion method

The costs related to the service provided sale of goods or services
rendered) are recognised in the statement of income at the same time
as the corresponding sales

Construction contracts

A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the
construction of an asset or group of assets that are closely linked or
interrelated in terms of their design, technology, function, purpose or use.

According to its characteristics, a notified construction contract can
either be accounted for separately, be segmented into several
components which are each accounted for separately, or be combined
with another construction contract in progress in order to form the scope
of the contract for accounting purposes in respect of which sales and
expenses will be recognised

Sales and expenses on construction contracts are recognised in
accordance with the technical percentage-of-completion method
However, when there is no significant time difference between technical
percentage of completion and contractual dates of transfer of
ownership, the percentage of completion is determined according
to the contractual transfer of ownership.

Penalties for late payment or the improper execution of a contract are
recognised as a deduction from sales. In the balance sheet, provisions
for penalties are deducted from assets related to the contract.

Expected losses on contracts are fully recognised as soon as they are

identified.

Selling, administrative and interest expenses are directly charged to the
profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred

Estimates of work remaining on loss-making contracts do not include
sales from claims made by the Group, except when it is highly
probable that such claims will be accepted by the customer.

Progress payments received on construction contracts are deducted
from contract assets as the contract is completed. Progress payments
received before the corresponding work has been performed
are classified in “advances received from customers on contracts”
in balance sheet liabilities.

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

The cumulative amount of costs incurred and profit recognised,
less any recognised losses and progress billings, is determined on a
contractby-contract basis. If this amount is positive, it is recognised
under “Construction contracts: assets” in the balance sheet. If it is
negative, it is recognised under “Construction contracts: liabilities”

d) Inventories and work in progress

In the consolidated balance sheet, work in progress related to
construction contracts is included under “Construction contracts: assets”
or “Construction contracts: liabilities”

Inventories and work in progress are carried at their production cost
(determined using the FIFO or weighted-average cost method) and
written down when production cost exceeds their net realisable value.
Work in progress, semi-finished and finished goods are stated at direct
cost of raw materials, production labour and subcontractor costs
incurred during production, plus an appropriate portion of production
overheads and any other costs that can be directly allocated to
contracts

When material, the cost of debt incurred during the construction of a
qualifying asset is incorporated in the value of the asset. When the
funding is specific, the loan interest rate is used, otherwise the Group's
financing rate is used

e) Research and development expenses

A significant share of research and development expenses is funded by
customers and government agencies. Internally funded research and
development expenses are charged to the profit and loss account as
incurred, except for project development costs which meet the criteria
below. In this case, the development costs are capitalised in balance
sheet assets:

e the product or process is clearly defined, and costs are separately
identified and reliably measured;

the technical feasibility of the product or project is clearly demonstrated,
and the Group's experience in this area is established;

e adequate resources are available to complete the project
successfully;

a potential market for the products exists or their usefulness, in case
of internal use, is demonstrated;

e the Company intends to produce and market, or use the new
product or process, and can demonstrate its profitability. Profitability
is assessed on the basis of prudent commercial assumptions in order
to reflect contingencies inherent to the long cycles of the Group's
activities, in particular Aerospace. Minimum internal rates of return
ate required in the case of projects deemed risky.

Capitalised development costs mainly relate to the Group's Aerospace
and Security activities, for which the products developed are relatively
generic and can be sold to a larger number of potential customers.
By contrast, development costs linked to Defence activities are for more
specific and restricted markets with a more limited number of players:
the specific features of the products developed make it harder to share
development work and therefore harder to capitalise the associated costs.

Development costs are then amortised over the useful life of the product.
The method of amortisation is generally determined by reference to
expected future quantities over the period in which future economic
benefits will be earned. If the method cannot be determined reliably,
linear amortisation is adopted. The period of amortisation depends on
the type of activity.

Assets are also subjected to impairment loss tests. The terms and
assumptions taken into account to conduct these tests are described in
Note 4. These impairment losses can be reversed. Impairment loss
reversal criteria are identical to those retained when first capitalising
development costs on a new project.


--- Page 60 ---

The Group receives tax credits related to research carried out by its
subsidiaries. These tax credits are considered as operating grants and
are therefore included in income from operations, when their award
is not dependent on the generation of taxable income. Otherwise,
they are recognised as a deduction from income tax expense.

f) Restructuring costs

Provisions for restructuring costs are set aside when restructuring
programs have been agreed and approved by Group management
and have been announced before the balance sheet date, resulting in
an obligating event of the Group to the third parties in question, as long
as the Group does not expect consideration for these costs.

Such costs primarily relate to severance payments, costs for notice
periods not worked and other costs linked to the closure of facilities
such as write-offs of fixed assets. These costs and the costs directly
linked to restructuring measures [removal costs, training costs of
transferred employees, etc.) are recognised under “restructuring costs”
in the profit and loss account.

g) Property, plant and equipment
and inten! le assets

Intangible assets
The Group's intangible assets mainly include
© goodwill (Note 14-b};

¢ assets acquired in business combinations, primarily acquired
technologies, customer relationships and the order backlog. These
assets are recognised at fair value and amortised over their useful
lives. The fair value of the assets is based on the market value. If no
active market exists, the Group uses methods based on forecasts of
the present value of the expected future operating cash flows (excess
earings method, royalty method, etc.);

¢ capitalised development costs (Note 14-e).

Intangible assets are submitted to impairment tests.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of any accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation of
property, plant and equipment is generally calculated on the basis of
the following typical useful lives:

© 20 years for buildings;

¢ 11010 years for technical facilities and industrial equipment and tooling;

e 5 to 10 years for other property, plant and equipment (vehicles,
fixtures, etc.)

The depreciable amount takes into account the residual value of the
asset. The different components of property, plant and equipment are
recognised separately when their estimated useful lives or patterns of
use, and thus the period over which they are depreciated or the
depreciation methods applicable to them, are materially different.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or
construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

h) Financial assets, financial liabilities
derivatives

Financial assets

Financial assets are initially recorded at fair value. They are
subsequently measured at either fair value or amortised cost, depending
on the category they fall into, as defined by IAS 39.

e Investments are designated as “available for sale" assets and
measured at fair value. The fair value corresponds to the market
price for shares quoted on a regulated market. For other shares, the
fair value is usually determined using valuation models provided by
independent third parties, or by reference to the share in net equity

Consolidated financial statements — 2016 Financial Information

held by the Group. Changes in fair value are recognised directly in
equity. If an impairment indicator is identified, impairment is
recognised in “other financial income (expensel’. Such impairments
are only written back to profit and loss at the date of disposal of the
security in question

e Receivables and financial loans are recognised at amortised cost.
They are subject to impairment if an impairment indicator is
identified. Such impairment, recognised in “other financial income
expense’, may subsequently be reversed through profit and loss if
the conditions which led to the impairment loss being recognised
cease to exist

¢ Deposits that Thales intends to hold until maturity are recognised at
amortised cost.

Other financial assets are estimated at fair value, with changes in
fair value recognised in profit and loss. They include money market
funds and other mutual funds, and interest rate products (certificates
of deposit, term deposits, medium-term negotiable notes, etc.)

© “Cash and cash equivalents” includes cash at bank and in hand as
well as cash equivalents [short-term and liquid investments that are
easily converted into a known amount of cash and exposed to
negligible risk of a change in value}

Financial liabilities

Borrowings and other financial liabilities are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest rate. Upon initial recognition, premiums,
redemption and issuance costs are included in the calculation of the
effective interest rate and are recognised in the profit and loss account
‘on an actuarial basis over the life of the loan.

Derivatives

The Group uses financial instruments to manage and reduce its
exposure to risks of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

Foreign exchange derivatives eligible for hedge accounting are
accounted for as follows

e the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging
instrument is recognised directly in equity until such time as the
hedged flows affect profit and loss. The ineffective portion is
recognised in profit and loss;

e the amount of the foreign currency denominated transaction is
subsequently translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date
of inception of the hedge

Changes in the fair value of premiums or discounts related to forward
foreign currency contracts, as well as the time value of foreign currency
options, are recognised in “other financial income {expense}” as they
are excluded from the hedging relationship.

Interest-rate derivatives are used either as fair value hedges or cash flow
hedges:

© a fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in the
value of assets and liabilities,

a cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in the
value of future cash flows (unknown future interest flows payable on
existing variable-rate borrowings or on highly probable future
borrowing issues, for example)

In the case of fair value hedge relationships, particularly for the portion
of fixed-rate bond debt swapped for a variable rate, the financial
liabilities hedged by the interest-rate derivatives are remeasured to the
extent of risk hedged. Changes in the value of hedged items are
recognised in profit and loss for the period and are offset by
symmetrical adjustments in interest-rate derivatives

In the case of cash flow hedging relationships, the effective portion of
changes in fair value of interest-rate derivatives shown in the balance
sheet is recognised directly in equity until such time as the hedged flows
affect profit and loss.

information — Consolidated financial statements

i) Deferred taxation

Thales recognises deferred taxes when the tax value of an asset or

liability differs from its book value.

Deferred tax assets are not recognised in the balance sheet if the
company concerned does not reasonably expect to recover the tax
asset. To assess its ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Group
takes into account forecast taxable income of the tax entities concerned,
generally over a five-year time-frame, non-recurring past events and tax
strategies specific to each country.

j) Pensions and other long-term employee benefits

The Group's defined benefit plan commitments are measured by
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method on the
basis of estimated salaries at the date of retirement. The calculations
mainly take into account assumptions concerning discounting as well as
inflation, mortality and staff turnover rates, etc.

Changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments —
corresponding to the effects of differences between previous actuarial
assumptions and what has actually occurred — give rise to actuarial
gains and losses:

¢ actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are
recognised in full within other comprehensive income, and are not
subsequently reclassfied to profit and loss. Where appropriate, the
same treatment is applied to adjustments linked to the ceiling on net
assets for plans in surplus.

e actuarial gains and losses on other long-term benefits are
recognised immediately in financial income (Note 9.3}

Past service cost, measured in cases of amendments or curtailments of
plans, and plan settlements are recognised in full within non-recurring
‘operating income in the period in which it is incurred

Net interest expense, determined based on the discount rate of
obligations, is recognised in financial income.

k) Share-based payment

Free share plans

Between 2007 and 2013, and then again in 2016, Thales granted
free shares and/or performance shares to its employees. These allotments
give rise to an expense representing the fair value of services received
at the grant date. This payroll expense is recognised against equity.

The fair value of the services received is calculated by reference to the
fair value of the shares at the grant date, less the present value of
dividends forfeited by employees during the vesting period, taking into
account the presence conditions.

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

Internal performance conditions are taken into account only by means
of an adjustment in the projected number of instruments acquired by
employees at the end of the vesting period. Therefore, they are not
taken into account in the fair value estimate of the instruments granted,
which is determined at the grant date.

The expense related to these plans is included in the current operating
income with the consolidated reserves account as counterpart without
impact on total equity. As the payment of compensation is subject to
presence conditions, the corresponding expense is recorded over the
vesting period on a straight-line basis. When appropriate, the expense
is adjusted over the vesting period to reflect any losses of rights.

Share unit plans indexed
to the value of the Thales share

A share unit plan indexed to the value of Thales shares, some of which
are performance shares, was implemented in 2014 and in 2015
At the maturity date, the beneficiaries will receive the value, about half
of which is in the form of shares and half in the form of cash-settled
share-based payment,

The proportion delivered in shares follows the sarne accounting policies
as those applied to free share plans. The accounting treatment
applicable to cash-settled share-based payments is governed by
IFRS 2. Under this policy, the services acquired and the liability incurred
are measured at fair value. Until the liability is settled, debt is
remeasured at each reporting date, with any changes in fair value
recognised in income for the period. The remeasurement of the liability
at the reporting date takes into account any changes in the value of the
underlying shares, as well as whether or not the presence conditions
and performance criteria have been met.

Phantom shares

Since this is a cash-settled plan, IFRS 2 requires an evaluation of vested
services and the liability assumed at fair value. Until the payment of the
liability, the debt is remeasured at the closing date and taken to profit
and loss. The remeasurement of the debt takes into account the
achievernent of performance and/or presence conditions, as well as
the change in value of the underlying shares

Company savings plans

Employee share offerings with a discount to the market price proposed
within Company savings plans do not include any vesting period
for rights but are subject to a legal five-year lock-up period
The measurement of the advantages granted to employees takes into
account the cost of the five-year lock-up period

1.2.7 Statutory auditors’ report

on the consolidated financial statements

To the Shareholders,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual
General Meetings, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
December 31, 2016 on

the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of
Thales;

the justification of our assessments;

© the spectfic verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the
Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards
applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or
other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the
Group as at December 31, 2016 and of the results of its operations for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

Il. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French
Commercial Code (Code de commerce} relating to the justification of
‘our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:

As stated in Note 1.4 “Main sources of estimates" to the consolidated
financial statements, your Company's general management is required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts included
in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to


--- Page 64 ---

these consolidated financial statements. These assumptions are by
nature uncertain, and the actual figures may vary from these estimates
under the circumstances anticipated in Note 1.4 “Main sources of
estimates” to the consolidated financial statements.

We considered that the items that have been subject to significant
accounting estimates, and which are likely to require justification of our
assessments, include construction contracts, impairment tests relating to
acquisition goodwill, deferred tax asset valuation, provisions for pension
plans and related contingency, and litigation and contingency provisions

e Customers contracts

Your Company recognizes income on its contracts, and in particular on
its construction contracts, in accordance with the methods set out in
Note 14-c “Sales” to the consolidated financial statements. Such
income is based on estimates of income on completion made by the
project managers, according to the Group's procedures and under the
control of Group's management.

Based on the information provided fo us at the time of our audit, our
work consisted in assessing the data and assumptions used to estimate
the income on completion for these contracts, comparing the amounts
of income on completion from previous financial periods with the
corresponding actual figures, and checking that the notes to the
financial statements provide appropriate information

© Acquisition goodwill

Acquisition goodwill, which appears in the balance sheet as at
December 31, 2016 for a net amount of €3,424.4 million, was
subject to impairment tests in accordance with the methods set out in
Note 4.1-b “Accounting policies — Impairment of non-current assets” to
the consolidated financial statements. We reviewed the methods for
carrying out these tests, based on discounted cash-flows of the business
activities, verified the consistency of the assumptions used with the
forecast data taken from the strategic plans drawn up for each business
activity under the Group's control and checked that Note 4.1
“Goodwill” provides appropriate information

Deferred tax assets

As stated in Notes 14-i “Deferred taxation" and 1.4 “Main sources of
estimates” to the consolidated financial statements, the recoverability
of net deferred tax assets amounting in the balance sheet as at

Consolidated financial statements — 2016 Financial Information

December 31, 2016 to €681.2 million was assessed on the basis of
forecast data taken from the strategic plans drawn up for each
consolidated tax group concerned, under the Group's control
We reviewed the recoverability tests performed by your Company on
these deferred tax assets and checked that Notes 14-i and 1.4 to the
financial statements provide appropriate information

Provisions for pension plans and related commitments

Certain headings in both the assets and liabilities sides of the balance
sheet drawn up for the consolidated financial statements, as well as off-
balance sheet commitments, are estimated on a statistical and actuarial
basis, in particular, the provisions for pension plans and related
commitments. The methods for calculating these headings are set out in
Notes 14-j “Accounting policies- Pensions and other employee benefits"
and 9.3 “Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits” to the
consolidated financial statements. Our work consisted in assessing the
data and assumptions used in the models for valuing these headings,
with due regard, in particular, to your Company's experience, its
regulatory and economic environment; as well as the overall consistency
of the assumptions and the appropriateness of the information given in
Notes 14-j and 9.3 to the financial statements

Litigation and contingency provisions

As regards litigation and contingency provisions, we ensured that the
procedures in force in your Group allow their identification, evaluation
and recognition from an accounting standpoint in satisfactory
conditions. We checked that the significant litigation and contingency
provisions identified during the implementation of these procedures
were described in appropriate terms in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements, and, in particular, in Notes 12 “Litigation” and 6.5

“Financial Risk Management’

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the
opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

I. Specific verification

As required by law we have also verified in accordance with
professional standards applicable in France the information presented
in the Group's management report.

We have no matters to report as fo its fair presentation and its consistency
with the consolidated financial statements.

PARENT COMPANY MANAGEMENT REPORT

AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.3.1

1.3.1.1 Activity and results

Operating income amounted to €636 million, compared with
€627 million in 2015. Sales came to €233 million, compared with
€209 million in 2015

Operations are described by sector in the Notes.

Sales mainly consist of rents re-billed to operating subsidiaries and sales
of research, chiefly conducted by the Central Research and Technology
depariment of Thales Group. The increase in sales is mainly due to the
centralisation of specific facility management and Thales (the parent
company) taking direct responsibility for the Massy site lease.

Other operating income amounted to €379 million, compared
with €393 million in 2015. It is made up of royalties paid by operating
subsidiaries and re-billed expenses, including for general and specific
centralised services provided by the parent company and capitalised
production. In 2015, it included re-billed costs of €15 million in relation
to the employee share purchase plan.

Net loss from operations amounted to €93 million, compared with a
loss of €70 million in 2015.

Net financial income came to €464 million, compared with
€849 million in 2015

Increases in provisions for equity investments and subsidiary risks
totalled €58 million in 2016 compared with €36 million in 2015
Reversals of provisions for equity investments and subsidiary risks
represented €53 million in 2016 compared with €193 million in
2015

Income from investments amounted to €496 million in 2016, versus
€701 million in 2015

Non-recurring expense amounted to €17 million, compared with
€1 million in 2015, mainly due to the recognition of a partial
reimbursement of Thales Suisse capital for €14 million in 2016

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of €78 million
compared with €94 million in 2015, due largely to Group relief from
the tax consolidation applied by Thales and its subsidiaries

In 2016, non-deductible expenses pursuant to Articles 223 quater and
39.4 of the French Tax Code (Code Général des Impéts) amounted to
€0.2 million

Profit for the year came to €431 million in 2016, compared with
€872 million in 2015

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

2016 parent company management report

1.3.1.2 Balance sheet
at 31 December 2016

The total balance sheet at 31 December 2016 represented
€14,302 million, up €493 million from €13,809 million at year-end
2015

The total non-current assets of €9,002 million (€8,882 million in
2015) are mainly composed of financial investments. The €114 million
increase in equity investments is mainly due to the Thales Avionics
Electrical Systems SAS capital increase for €76 million, and the
acquisition of shares in Thales Canada Inc and Forges de Zeebrugge
for €32 million and €26 million, respectively.

Other financial investments rose by €14 million, largely as a result of
loans granted to Group subsidiaries in an amount of €26 million,
of which €10 million was allocated to Thales South Africa Systems,
parially offset by the full repayment in 2016 of the €10 million loan in
relation to the employee share purchase plan that was granted in 2015.

Current assets rose €373 million to €5,300 million at 31 December 2016.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by €233 million reflecting the
improved operating cash flow of subsidiaries. The €71 million
decrease in other receivables is mainly due to foreign exchange
revaluations and a decrease in tax receivables from the French State,
with negative impacts of €43 million and €37 million, respectively.

The €33 million increase in treasury shares assigned to plans results
from the market purchase of shares for €46 million in 2016 for allocation
to the 2013 plan, offset by the delivery of shares worth €17 million under
the 2012 free share plan

Other investments of €250 million corresponded to deposits with first-tier
banks with maturities of 3 to 12 months.

The balance of Group company current accounts represented a net
payable of €4,350 million at year end 2016, compared
with €3,963 million at year-end 2015

Borrowings amounted 10 €1,459 million at 31 December 2016,
versus €1,460 million at 31 December 2015. They mainly include
bond issues for €1,400 million, as well as foreign-currency and euro
denominated borrowings from Group subsidiaries and associates

At 31 December 2016, share capital stood at €636.6 million and total
equity came to €6,829 million, compared with €6,650 million at
year-end 2015

Supplier payment schedules

Thales pays its suppliers 60 days after the invoice date, in line with the
maximum period allowed under the French law on the modernisation of
the economy (Loi de modernisation de I'économie — UME).

NOTE 6. INCOME TAX

General framework
and accounting principles

6.1

Since 1 January 1992, Thales has opted for the Group tax
consolidation regime. Thales is the head of a tax consolidation group
that includes the majority of its French subsidiaries pursuant to the tax
regime provided by Article 223A of the French Tax Code

In accordance with the tax consolidation agreement entered into
between Thales and its subsidiaries, each subsidiary in the tax group
records the amount of tax it would have paid had they been taxed
separately. Any tax savings arising on the use of tax losses of
subsidiaries are recorded by the parent company and recognised in the

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

income statement. However, the parent company may have to record a
corresponding tax expense, if and when these subsidiaries return to
profit and are able to deduct the losses as they would have done had
they been taxed separately.

The income tax rate for 2016 decreased to 34.43% from 38% in
2015, following the decision not to renew the 10.7% surtax in 2016.
Tax loss carryforwards are attributable up to the limit of 50% of taxable
profit in excess of €1 million. In addition, since 17 August 2012, French
companies have been subject to a 3% tax on dividend distributions.

Thales also benefits from tax credits related to its research and
development activities at the Palaiseau site, which are recorded against
income tax expense

reintegrated as a result of a tax audit. Expenditure excluded from
deductible expenses in accordance with Articles 223 quater and 39.4

6.3 Deferred tax

¢ temporary differences arising on the different tax and accounting
treatments of income and expenses [€128.0 million at 31 December 2016
compared with €127.66 million at 31 December 2015}. They mainly
reflect provisions for contingencies and losses, in particular
provisions for post-employment benefits, which are not deductible
for tax purposes; and

of the French Tax Code amounted to €0.2 million in both 2016 and
2015, reflecting excess amortisation of vehicles.

NOTE 8. EQUITY INVESTMENTS

8.1

Equity investments are recorded at cost price and related acquisition
costs are recognised in the income statement. In the event that the
carrying value exceeds value in use, a provision for impairment is
recorded for the difference.

Accounting policies

Value in use is determined based on profitability forecasts, the underlying
assets, recent transactions or the market price of any listed securities.

The profitability forecasts are determined on the basis of expected future
cash flows set out in the three-year strategic plans and a terminal value.

The assumptions used are prudent with forecast growth in sales and
terminal values limited to 2%.

The discount rate used is calculated on the basis of the Group's
weighted average cost of capital (8.5% in 2016 as in 2015], adjusted
if necessary for the specific risks attributable to each equity investment.
This rate is mainly based on the market risk-free rate, risk factors
inherent in the Group's businesses, the Group's marginal borrowing rate
and specific risks for which cash flows have not been adjusted.

Impairment tests are carried out annually at year-end in line with the
Group’ internal schedule for the preparation of Group entity strategic plans.

8.2 Change in equity investments

A breakdown of equity investments is presented in Note 24. Changes are presented below:

10.1 General framework and
accounting principles

The Group company current-account amounts presented in the parent
company balance sheet represent the receivables and payables
between the parent company and its subsidiaries as part of the Group's
cash pooling organisation

Under this centralised system, the cash surpluses of subsidiaries are
generally transferred to the parent company. In return, the parent
company ensures that the cash requirements of its subsidiaries are met.
Except in special cases, this system is applied to all subsidiaries in
which Thales exercises majority control.

recognised as due within one year

NOTE 14. TREASURY SHARES

14.1 Accounting policies

Thales carries out transactions in its own shares in accordance with the
authorisations granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General
Meeting

At year-end, treasury shares are recognised and measured on the basis
of their assigned function

treasury shares that have not been assigned are recorded under
other financial investments at their acquisition cost. At the reporting
date, an impairment loss is recognised if their carrying value
exceeds the average stock market price for December;

© treasury shares assigned to a free share plan are recorded under

14.2 Change in treasury shares

Change in the number of treasury shares

marketable securities, either at their acquisition cost if the shares
were assigned from the beginning of the plan, or at their net carrying
value at the reclassification date if they were assigned after their
acquisition,

These treasury shares are not measured at market value because
they are set aside to be granted to employees. Consequently:

= shares allocated to parent company (Thales) employees are
amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the plan
(48 months) through an increase in provisions for contingencies
and losses recorded in liabilities,

= shares allocated to other Group employees are maintained at
historical cost, as they will be re billed to the relevant subsidiaries
for the same amount.

At 31 December 2016, Thales held 749,559 treasury shares, including 126,044 shares (0.10% of share capital) that were freely transferable, and
623,515 shares (0.30% of share capital) assigned to the 17 September 2013 free share plan

NOTE 16. RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

16.1 Accounting policies

Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are
generally hedged and are consequently translated at the hedged
foreign exchange rate

The Thales parent company hedges currency risks related to contracts
‘or normal commercial transactions on behalf of its subsidiaries. At each
reporting date:

derivative instruments subscribed by Thales (parent company) with
bank counterparties are measured at market value and presented as

an asset or a liability in the balance sheet under “Translation
difference and exchange rate adjustments”;

e exchange guarantees granted to subsidiaries are measured at
market value and presented as an asset or a liability in the balance
sheet under “Translation difference and exchange rate adjustments”

The balance of these accounts corresponds mainly to cash
management timing differences between amounts received from and
paid to subsidiaries and cash in-flows and outflows between Thales and
the bank in the context of foreign exchange derivatives management.

17.1 Accounting policies

The Group records a provision when it recognises a legal or
constructive obligation resulting from a past event for which an outflow
of resources will be required and a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount, Provisions are generally recorded for the following

Provisions for post-employment

contributions to State plans (social security, compulsory additional plans

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

such as ARRCO and AGIRC, etc.| for which the recognised expense for
the financial year is equal to the amounts paid

The Company grants its employees termination payments and other
long-term benefits (long-service awards and an additional week of
paid holidays during the employee's 35! year of service within the
Group]. Some senior executives also benefit from a supplementary
pension plan

In accordance with ANC Regulation 2013-02, a provision is
recognised for obligations that qualify as defined benefit plans. It is
calculated on the basis of an actuarial valuation, determined using the
projected unit credit method and taking into account future salary levels.

Parent company management report and financial statements — 2016 Financial Information

This method consists in assessing for each employee, the present value of
the benefits that he or she can expect at the due date, by applying
assumptions concerning discount rates, inflation, mortality and staff turnover.

These plans are recognised in the Company's financial statements as
follows:

the service cost, which corresponds to the increase in the obligation
during the reporting period, is recognised in income (loss) from
operations;

the costs of unwinding the net obligation as well as actuarial gains
and losses due to changes in assumptions and experience
adjustments are recognised in financial income (expense);

e the impact of plan amendments following renegotiations of
employee benefits is recognised in non recurring income (expense)

17.2 Breakdown of provisions

Provisions for subsidiary risks

Equity investments held by Thales are measured at the end of each
reporting period and an impairment loss is recorded if necessary.
In the event that the investment is fully written down and Thales’ share in
the equity of the subsidiary or associate becomes negative, a provision
for subsidiary risks may be recognised when considered necessary.

Provisions for restructuring

Provisions for restructuring costs are recorded when a restructuring
programme has been agreed with a third party, approved by Group
management and announced before the reporting date, resulting in an
obligation to the third parties in question, and for which the Group does
not expect any consideration for the costs

NOTE 18. LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

18.1

Due to the nature of its business, Thales is exposed to the risk of technical
and commercial disputes

Legal risks

To prevent disputes or limit their impact, Thales’ policy is to
systematically seek alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This policy
is reviewed on a regular basis to take into account changes in the
Group's core areas of business and is backed by employee training
programmes

In addition, Thales implemented a procedure several years ago to
centralise all civil, commercial and criminal litigation and claims. These are
handled by the Corporate Legal Affairs department, with the support of
the Group companies concerned

At the end of 2002, a group of French manufacturers, including Thales
and one of its subsidiaries, collectively received a request for arbitration
from a shared customer claiming an amount which allegedly should be
no less than $260 million and for which the group of French
manufacturers might be jointly liable towards the claimant. This request
for arbitration is related to the execution of old contracts by the group of
French manufacturers. Pursuant fo an agreement signed by all of the
parties in June 2003, the claimant withdrew its request for arbitration
In November 2012, the claimant filed a new request for arbitration for
a revised amount of €226 million of which Thales’ share would be
around 28% of the amount claimed. The manufacturers are strongly
disputing this demand and at this date it is not possible to evaluate any
potential financial risk. Accordingly, Thales has not set aside a provision
in respect of this dispute. Proceedings are ongoing.

There are no other government, judicial or arbitration claims, of which
the Group is aware, which are pending or threatened, which could
have, or which had, in the course of the last 12 months, any significant
effect on the financial position or the profitability of the Company
and/or the Group.

18.2 Environmental risks

Due to the nature of its business, Thales is exposed to environmental
risks related to potential adverse environmental and health effects
resulting from its activities, the impact of the environment on its
operations and non-compliance with new regulations applicable to its
activities and products.

For many years, Thales has regularly analysed and updated its
environmental risks on the basis of its business activities, scientific and
technical developments and emerging environmental challenges.

This analysis, represented by risk mapping, is intended to

ensure that employees and local residents are not exposed to health
and environmental risks;

© ensure the compliance of its activities and products;
© analyse the impact of new regulations, including on product design;

e identify an appropriate organisational structure and associated
action plans, either at Group level or locally, according to the risk
mapping results

In support of this analysis, an environmental management system has
been deployed at all sites in order to ensure the control and limitation of
the environmental impacts of the Group's products and activities. This
management system is deployed throughout the different business lines
as part of the Group's framework. Consequently, environmental skills
and know-how have been rolled out to services such as engineering,
research, procurement and contracts.

At 31 December 2016, provisions for environmental risks amounted
to €1.0 million

NOTE 20. MARKET RISKS

20.1 Accounting policies

The Thales parent company Treasury and Financing department is
active in the financial markets in order to reduce the interest rate and
foreign exchange risks of the Group

Interest rate derivatives

Thales uses interest rate derivatives to manage and reduce its exposure
fo interest rate fluctuations. When the derivatives are designated as
hedging instruments, the gains and losses on the hedge are recognised
in the same period as the hedged item.

Currency derivatives

Thales hedges currency risks arising on commercial offers entered into
by its subsidiaries, which are denominated in currencies other than the
main operating currency. The gains and losses on currency derivatives
subscribed by Thales with bank counterparties are recognised in the
income statement. A provision is recorded in the event that the valuation
of Thales’ commitment to hedge the offers of its operating subsidiaries
is negative.

20.2

Thales hedges currency risks related to firm contracts and normal
commercial transactions on behalf of its subsidiaries. As such, it
guarantees its operating subsidiaries a specific exchange rate for each
transaction and backs up its position by arranging currency derivatives
with banking counterparts. Both the unrealised and realised gains and
losses, on the bank derivatives and the subsidiaries’ guarantees, are
recognised symmetrically in the income statement.

Thales hedges the currency risks related to its cash pooling system. The
gains and losses on currency derivatives are offset by the gains and
losses resulting from the revaluation of the hedged Group company
current accounts and loans. However, gains or losses related to the
derivatives’ swap points are spread over the term of the hedge.

In some cases, Thales hedges the property liability risks on its net
foreign assets. The gains and losses on currency derivatives are
recognised in the balance sheet under “Translation difference and
exchange rate adjustments” [see Note 16), with the exception of the
gains or losses related to the derivatives’ swap points, which are
spread over the term of the hedge.

Interest rate risk management

At 31 December 2016 and 2015, Thales held the following derivative instruments, which all qualify as hedges

performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of
selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the
assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at
December 31, 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then
ended in accordance with French accounting principles.

Il. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French
Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of
‘our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:

2016 for a net amount of €8,787.6 million are assessed at their cost
price and subject to impairment tests in accordance with the methods
set out in Note 8 to the financial statements.

Our work consisted in assessing the data used to estimate the net
realizable value, in particular, we reviewed the update of forecast
profitability of the subsidiaries and investments, and verified the
consistency of the assumptions used with the forecast data taken from
the strategic plans drawn up for each of these subsidiaries or
investments under management's control and checked that the notes to
the financial statements provide appropriate information.

Litigation and contingency provisions

As regards litigation and contingency provisions, we ensured that the
procedures in force in your Company made it possible to identify,
evaluate and recognize such provisions from an accounting standpoint
in satisfactory conditions. We also ensured that the disputes identified
during the implementation of these procedures were described
in appropriate terms in the notes to the financial statements, and,
in particular, in Note 18

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial

2.1.1.2.3 Significant events in 2016

In civil avionics, Thales partnered with Airbus as it increased its
production levels during the year, particularly for the A350. 2016 also
saw the successful first flight of the Cessna Citation Longitude business
jet, which is equipped with Thales flight controls. In parallel, there were
very positive results from the flight tests carried out for TopMax head-
worn display systems. More than 20 airlines chose to use the
flight management systems (FMS) and terrain collision avoidance
systems (T3CAS} in over 400 Airbus planes. The teams of Thales and
Brussels Airlines (BEL) made a technical breakthrough by successfully
testing a new live weather service that sends weather updates to the
pilot's Electronic Flight Bag system throughout the flight. The flight tests
were carried out on A330 aircraft with BEL pilots. Thales also
confirmed its positioning in airline support, as it was named best
avionics support supplier for the year by Airbus and came in number
two worldwide for airlines.

In military avionics, a new export contract was won for the Rafale, in
India. In addition, the Scorpion helmet-mounted sight and display
system was selected for 80 EF-18 fighter planes of the Spanish air force
and 200 lightarmed helicopters in South Korea. The South Korean
armed forces also chose Thales’ military avionics system to equip their
MRIT refuelling planes.

In terms of in-flight entertainment business, several airlines — including
Gul Air, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Emirates — opted for the
AVANT solution, and in the connectivity market a major agreement was
signed with SES to offer airlines and their passengers in-flight
broadband connectivity over the whole of the Americas, with optimal
speeds thanks to Ka-band high-throughput satellite (HTS) services.

In training and simulation, Thales and AMST were selected by the
United Kingdom Ministry of Defence to supply a new mission simulation
training centre for fighter jet pilots. Airbus Helicopters chose Thales and
their joint venture Helisim to design and build the full flight simulator
(FFS) for the new H160. Two helicopter training centres were opened
during the year, in Norway (Stavanger) and Australia (Brisbane).

In electrical systems, Thales reached another milestone at the
beginning of the year, by successfully completing a round of fight trials
using a prototype ATR 72 turboprop equipped with a new energy
management system that optimizes power demand

In microwave and imaging subsystems, a number of new orders were
taken in 2016, including a contract signed with SES for the supply of
high-power Ka-band tubes for the new SES 17 satellite ordered from
Thales, which will increase SES's in-flight connectivity capabilities

meet the needs of society in general. They provide communications and
navigation services, monitor the environment and the oceans, help
better understand climate change and drive scientific progress. Going
beyond planet Earth, they also respond to the challenges of exploring
the Universe, and thanks to the partnership with the International Space
Station they create tangible links between humans and outer space.

At the forefront of a digital and connected world

Thales Alenia Space has drawn on its long-standing expertise in
satellite telecommunications to launch cutting-edge offerings that meet
today’s fast-changing needs: Spacebus NEO, a modular geostationary
platform (including a version with an all-electric propulsion}; EliteBus for
low and medium Earth orbit missions; and flexible, digital and very
high-speed payloads. Thales Alenia Space puts all of these new
technologies to the service of its customers and users, who are
becoming more and more connected, with increasingly high-quality
data services, all thanks to these space technology projects. The O3b
and Leosat constellations as well as Iridium NEXT satellites (for mobile
voice and data communications) are already providing - or will soon
provide — broadband connections in numerous areas of the world. The
new projects that Thales Alenia Space is currently working on not only
concern communications but also the protection of people and
countries, using military satellites (Comsat NG in particular),

A key participant in environmental programmes

Thales Alenia Space's expertise in high-resolution (sub-metric) optical
and radar payloads for military, civilian or dual missions covers a wide
range of uses, including information gathering, target designation,
meteorology, altimetry, oceanography, climatology, cartography and
crisis management. Thales Alenia Space satellites help provide a better
understanding of planet Earth and how to protect it, with prime
examples being the Sentinel satellites for Copernicus and the different
generations of Mefeosat meteorological observation satellites.

At the forefront of exploring the ori

Thales Alenia Space is the prime contractor for the flagship
ExoMars 2020 programe dedicated to the search for life on Mars,
which follows on from the ExoMars 2016 scientific mission that
launched the trace gas orbiter (TGO}. The company is also the prime
contractor for EUCLID — the satellite used for a scientific mission
launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) to explore the roles
played by dark matter in the evolution of the Universe. In addition it led

called KASS (Korean Augmentation Satellite System). This is the
Company's first export contract in this area based on EGNOS
(European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System), which was
developed by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor. The Company
was also awarded a contract by the European Commission to provide
system engineering and operational support services for the Galileo
programme

In 2016, Thales Alenia Space participated in the following seven
launches: three satellites dedicated to the climate and the environment
jason 3, Sentinel 3A and Sentinel 18], two Cygnus cargo resupply
craft for the International Space Station, one high-resolution observation
satellite for Turkey (Gokturk], and the interplanetary probe for the
ExoMars programme whose TGO module dedicated to the search for
life on Mars is now operational and in orbit.

The development of Thales Alenia Space's European operations
continued in 2016, with (i) the acquisition of RUAG's opto electronics
division, which led to the creation of Thales Alenia Space Switzerland
as well as the opening of white rooms dedicated to the Company's

2.1.2.2.3 Significant events in 2016

Following on from 2015 - which was a record year in terms of order
intake for the urban signalling activity (especially in London, Hong Kong
and Doha) ~ in 2016, Thales signed a major contract for the extension
of the Dubai metros Red Line, in preparation for Expo 2020.

Thales continued to roll out its CBTC™ (Communications-Based Train
Control) technology, extending it to more than ten new lines, primarily in
Canada, the United States, Chile, Malaysia, Singapore and South
Korea.

In China, which represents a significant proportion of the international
market for new metro lines, the Thales SAIC Transportation System (TST)
joint venture continued to develop its business in 2016. TST won several

1% ey

contracts for new metro lines and line extensions, notably in Nanjing,
Ningbo, Jinan, VWuhan and Shanghai. In Autumn 2016, line | of the
Hefei metro opened several months ahead of schedule, demonstrating
TST's capacity to successfully complete the numerous projects it has in its
portfolio.

Thales was chosen to supply the signalling system for the extension of
the light Rail Transit (LRT) network in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, having
completed Taiwan's Danhai LRT project.

In Egypt, Thales won the contract for the communications, security and
passenger information systems control centre for the third phase of line 3
of the Cairo metro.

In mainline signalling, Thales continued to roll out its ETCS (European

Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and Poland. The mainline
activity was also underpinned by framework agreements to supply
signalling systems in several European countries, including Germany,
Austria, Switzerland and Norway.

In Switzerland, the signalling system for the Gothard tunnel — the world’s
longest railway tunnel — was delivered and brought into service in
2016, one year ahead of schedule. Following this success, which
came on the heels of the successful completion of the signalling project
for the Létschberg tunnel, Thales signed another contract for a railway
tunnel signalling system, this time for the Ceneri tunnel. This new tunnel
is the final section of the European rail corridor connecting the North
Sea with the Mediterranean Sea, passing under the Alps. It will link
Zurich with Milan in less than three hours compared with five with the
current infrastructure.

Thales strengthened its presence in Africa during the year, marking
significant milestones in its rollout of electronic interlocking systems in
South Africa's Cape region

In Saudi Arabia, Thales won the maintenance contract for the 2,400 km
North South Rail (NSR) line linking the north of the country with the
south. This contract follows on from the successful deployment of ETCS
technology on this line — one of the longest to be equipped with ETCS

In ticketing, Thales successfully pursued the introduction of the
Transcity™ solution onto the market, thanks to new projects in India,
Holland and Taiwan. In November 2016, the Group announced that it
had entered into negotiations with the private equity firm Latour Capital
with a view to selling its ticketing business. This project is currently in
consultations with employee representative bodies and will be subject
to customary closing procedures.

2.1.3 Defence & Security segment

Thales is a long-standing pariner to military and security forces around
the world, providing support on the ground to increase operational
effectiveness as well as ensuring the highest levels of protection

Thales designs systems for all sectors: land, ai, naval, space and
cyberspace (digital networks). These systems detect and assess threats,
manage information, support rapid command decisions and the
implementation of suitable responses {including threat neutralisation),
with maximum reliability. Furthermore, by facilitating the coordination of
joint or coalition forces’ operations, they contribute to the decision-making
superiority of these forces.

As new risks emerge, defence alone cannot protect against new threats
such as trafficking, terrorism, organised crime, cyber-attacks, natural
disasters, etc

2.1.3.1 Key data

This convergence of defence and security requires new solutions and
technologies to be implemented to enable the sharing of existing
information and communication systems, as well as the protection of

2.1.3.2 Secure communications
and information systems

2.1.3.2.1 General overview

At the heart of the defence-security continuum, Thales offers
interoperable and secure information and telecommunications systems
for military forces, security forces and essential operators. These
activities, which include radiocommunications, networks, protection
systems, critical information systems and cybersecurity, respond to the
needs of markets in which the use of new digital technologies such as
AG mobile communications, cryptography, cloud computing and big
data are of the utmost importance. Thales is present throughout the
value chain, from equipment through to systems and systems of systems,
as well as logistical support and related services.

These activities are developed around four segments:

© radiocommunication products: Thales designs radios and
embedded and tactical communications systems for all three sectors
(land, air and sea}, friend or foe identification systems (IFF), radio
navigation systems and solutions for electronic communications
warfare. The armed forces of more than 50 countries around the
world are equipped with Thales solutions. The Group is a major
player in the development of interoperable, secure Software-Defined
Radio (SDR) solutions and is the prime contractor for the French
army's CONTACT programme

e network and infrastructure systems: ensuring the security, integrity,
service continuity and resilience of deployable or mobile
infrastructure and telecommunications networks are major challenges
for governments, armed forces and “essential” businesses
(healthcare, water, energy, communications, etc.). For these needs,
Thales designs, builds and operates secure infrastructure networks
for its customers, including for theatres of operations (in Afghanistan,

THALES — 2016 Registration Document

Mali and the Central African Republic}. In France, the Group
operates the information, communication and security systems at the
new French Ministry of Defence site (“Balard") in Paris. Thales has
also been selected to upgrade the French Ministry of Defence's
resilient communications network as part of its DESCARTES
programme, as well as its transmission programmes related to
nuclear deterrence

© protection systems: Thales develops information, command and
intelligence systems for armed forces (military functions known as
CAISR — Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance). The Group also
responds to the growing security needs of nations (identity
management, border control and surveillance systems}, of cities
(urban security, smart cities, crisis management, security for large
events) and of critical infrastructure (protection of airports, public
transportation, sensitive sites and energy sites]. These systems are
intended to facilitate rapid decision-making for operators as well as
the coordination of the various players in command and control
centres or in mobile situations, by providing users with relevant,
clear and immediate information about their environment.

© critical information systems and cybersecurity: Thales is one of the
world leaders in business data protection and a European leader in
cybersecurity. Through its network, cloud and mobile equipment
protection products and data security solutions, Thales offers
solutions to protect the information systems and critical data of its

In the Netherlands, the Defence Cyber Command (DCC] and Thales
entered into a contract to set up a virtual cybersecurity training and
testing facility, known as “Cyber Range”

During the year, the Group completed its acquisition of Vormetric, a
leading provider of data protection solutions in physical, virtual and
cloud infrastructures. This investment reinforces the portfolio of solutions
offered by Thales eSecurity — a major player in hardware security
modules (HSM) - and has created a global leader in corporate data
security.

Thales secured several key contracts in this field during 2016, including
with Salesforce for setting up a pilot programme enabling customers to
keep control over the encryption keys of their sensitive data, and with
Samsung for deploying data security technologies on its ARTIK™
“Internet of things” platform.

Following the trend of other large corporations in recent years, the
ENGIE energy group has chosen Thales to help it reinforce the security
of its IT infrastructures.

Meanwhile, in France, the Group submitted its cyberattack detection
probe for certification from the French agency for information systems
security (ANSSI). This digital confidence solution meets the requirements
of the French military programming law which all essential operators
will have to comply with by 2019

2.2 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION

Thales needs to be able to offer increasingly sophisticated technologies,
particularly in the detection, analysis and decision-making fields,
in order to design and develop critical information systems. These
innovative solutions serve customers in the aeronautics, space, ground
transportation, defence and security markets.

2.2.1

Thales bases its vision of innovation on openness and parinership

across multiple dimensions

© a technological dimension, by collaborating with academic
laboratories;

® an entrepreneurial dimension by forging closer ties with SMEs and
start-ups;

a “market” dimension, by jointly innovating with customers and their
ecosystems fo create new usages.

Research and development,

the key to competitiveness and growth

Some 25,000 Thales employees, over 70% of them engineers, are
involved in the Group's technical operations, ranging from research to
engineering. In 2016, Thales spent €741 million (approximately 5%
of sales) purely on self-funded R&D, an essential lever to remain
competitive.

A significant portion of this budget is devoted to upstream research,
conducted both at Thales Research & Technology (TRT] laboratories and
the Group's centres of expertise, in order to develop:

new technologies;

new system and product concepts;

new engineering tools and methods for critical information systems.

2.2.2 Four key technical domains

Governance of research and development for key technologies is split
into four domains

hardware technologies: electronics, electromagnetism, optronics,
acoustics, radiofrequency techniques and management of thermal
constraints;

software technology: processing computers, real-time on-board
systems, distributed systems, service-oriented architectures,
model-driven engineering, and cybersecurity;

information and cognitive sciences: data fusion, data mining,
autonomous systems, synthetic environments, and human factors;

systems: focused on systems design architecture, this area provides
support for methodology, processes and expertise

Active electronic scanning antennae come of age

Active electronic scanning antennae not only give radars extreme
agility, they also enable them to simultaneously track multiple
targets. Thales has already produced this type of antenna for all
environments — land, sea, air and space — with the most well-known
being the one used for the Rafale fighter aircraft

Thanks to the innovations developed since 2010 by the Group's
R&D teams, it can now offer all of the benefits of these new
antennae at no extra cost compared with conventional
mechanical antennae. Both architectural and technological
advances have enabled the Group to fine-tune a “tiled”
approach, whereby each of the thousands of active
transmitters-receivers making up the active antenna is as compact
as a small electronic component.

Available in two versions depending on the density level of the
beamed energy, this concept has delivered excellent radioelectric
performances. The Group has the necessary manufacturing
capabilities in place to mass produce this new generation of
active antennae in a cost-effective way.

Research and innovation — Business review

2.2.3 Thales at the heart of innovation ecosystems

Wherever it is located, Thales seeks to build partnerships within
innovation ecosystems, with academic partners, design centres,
innovative businesses and industrial groups for joint innovation on
applications, business models and technologies

To develop the technologies it needs, the Group relies heavily on
cooperation between its research teams and the academic world
Thales Research & Technology [TRT), an international network of
corporate laboratories, is responsible for building relationships with
academic partners.

TRT has facilities in France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
Singapore and Canada. In France, the Palaiseau laboratory, located
on the Ecole Polytechnique campus, is heavily involved in the
programme to build up the world-class science and technology
complex in Saclay,

Similarly, Thales’ research centre in the Netherlands is located at Delft
University, while the Singapore centre has partnered with Nanyang
Technological University and with France's national research institute
CNRS, in one of the few joint international research units with an
industrial partner.

In France, Thales has numerous strategic parinerships, for example, with
the CNRS, Ecole Polytechnique, Telecom Paris Tech, and Université
Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC-Paris VI), whose partnership was renewed
in 2016 for a further five years

The most advanced form of partnership is the joint laboratory, such as
those operated by Thales with the CNRS for physics, with CEA-LETI
as part of the Ill-V Lab (an EIG whose members are Alcatel Lucent SA,
Thales and CEA-LETI), with CEA-LIST for artificial vision and the
implementation of formal approaches in critical software, and with
UPMC in data mining, etc.

Thales is positioned as a major player in numerous high-tech clusters
(including Systematic Paris-Région, Aerospace Valley in southwest
France, the Maritime clusters in Brittany and Provence-Alpes-Céte
d'Azur, the Images ef Réseaux (images and networks} telecommunications
cluster in Brittany, etc.) and the IRT (Institut de Recherche Technologique
SaintExupéry], of which it is a founding member

In the United Kingdom, TRT has direct links with several major Universities
through its R&T centre, including Cambridge, Bristol and Southampton
Thales is an active member of many collaborative partnerships in the
United Kingdom: the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT),
based at Queen's University Belfast; the Centre for Smart Infrastructure
and Construction (CSIC) and the Institute for Manufacturing (IM), based
at Cambridge University; the UK Defence Growth Partnership (DGP);
the mobile Virtual Centre of Excellence (mVCE}, with numerous
Universities; the Defence Academic Pathways (DAP) and the UK
Catapults, particularly the Digital Catapult where Thales has contributed
to the emergent loT defining the security implications of pervasive digital
Sensors and their associated data. Thales participates in a number of
key UK associations and councils to influence UK government policies
in Science, Technology and Innovation: the Engineering & Physical
Science Research Council EPSRC], the Confederation of British Industry
(CBI) Inter Company Academic Relations Group (ICARG} and the
National Centre for Universities & Business (NCUB) Science &
Innovation.

In Canada, the Group regularly works with research networks and
institutions such as CRIAQ (Consortium de Recherche et Innovation en
Aérospatiale au Québec), the University of Toronto, McGill University,
the Ecole Polytechnique de Montréal and Laval University, with which
Thales has entered into an agreement for a joint research unit in urban
sciences. In 2016, Thales joined the IVADO — an institute for data
valorisation that brings together industry professionals and academic
researchers to develop cutting-edge expertise in big data which has
significant value-creation potential for numerous business sectors.

In the United States, Thales has forged links with innovation ecosystems
in Boston (centred on MIT) and the Silicon Valley.

In emerging countries, the Group is developing its R&D activities by
establishing innovation platforms locally, using the tried and tested
principles of joint innovation with local players and, in so doing,
building long-term, trust-based relationships.

In 2016, Thales continued to step up its work with start-ups. For example,
during the year it increased its investment in Starburst — a start-up
incubator specialised in aerospace, of which Thales is a founding
member — to help it expand its activities in North America and Germany.
In just wo years, over 300 start-ups have been analysed and 25 real-life
case studies have been carried out with the Group's business units.

Training also forms part of this overall strategy of linking the Group with
the academic world. The Group supports around 200 Ph.D. students
worldwide. They work on subjects directly connected with the technical
issues facing Thales, which therefore reinforces its appeal to young
scientists. Thales also supports ten teaching chairs in subjects that are in
line with its technical priorities.

FOCUS 2
Sentry of the seas

In Autumn 2016, Thales unveiled its Autonomous Underwater and
Surface System (AUSS), which represents a veritable breakthrough
in terms of both concept and technology in the field of maritime
surveillance. In hostile and dangerous environments, autonomous
systems constitute the state-of-the-art solution that naval forces

need

AUSS is a hybrid unmanned system based on a totally new
propulsion concept. Navigating in total security and with agility, it
is capable of operating both above and below the surface and
can avoid obstacles. It is designed for missions including naval
surveillance, intelligence gathering on the surface, maritime
counter-errorism and mine countermeasures

In order to complete the development of AUSS in a record three
years, Thales teamed up with 18 French SMEs to create a

2.2.4 A dynamic approach to intellectual property management

Thales supports its R&D activities with a dynamic approach to intellectual
property management.

The Group filed more than 300 new patent applications in 2016.
The continued large number of patent applications in recent years
reflects Thales’ commitment to innovation and its ability to translate
research results into competitive advantages. In 2016, Thales was once
again included in the Top 100 Global Innovators ranking compiled by
Clarivate Analytics (formerly Thomson Reuters Intellectual Property &
Science], with the Group standing out for the volume, success and
influence of its patents. This achievement underlines Thales’ commitment
to innovating, protecting its ideas and bringing its inventions to market.
Thales has been included in this prestigious ranking four times since 2011,
which testifies to the importance the Group places on implementing an
active and ambitious intellectual property management strategy.

The Thales portfolio, which includes more than 15,000 patents and
patent applications, is regularly adapted to operational requirements,
particularly to protect Thales’ market share.
