Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

GROUP
HIGHLIGHTS

The Maersk Group delivered a profit of USD
925m (USD 5.2bn) and an underlying profit
of USD 3.1bn (USD 4.5bn). After a satisfac-
tory result in the first half of the year with a
ROIC of 10.2%, Maersk Group was severely
impacted by a widening supply-demand gap
across most of our businesses, leading to
significant oil price and freight rate reduc-
tions. ROIC for the second half of the year
was negative 6.3%, impacted by impair-
ments of USD 2.5bn after tax in Maersk Oil
and for G4 there was an underlying loss of
USD 9m (profit of USD 1.0bn).

The Group delivered a strong cash flow from
operating activities of USD 8.0bn (USD 8.8bn)
for the year and USD 2.0bn (USD 2.4bn) in 04,
despite a significant decline in container
freight rates and oil prices.

The demand for transportation of goods was significantly lower
than expected, especially in the emerging markets as well as
the Group's key Europe trades, where the impact was further
accelerated by de-stocking of the high inventory levels. At the
same time, the container transportation industry experienced
asignificant increase in new tonnage ordered two to four years
ago on the back of higher economic growth expectations and

a focus on larger and more fuel-efficient vessels. The combi-
nation of low demand and high supply increase led to sharp
freight rate declines in the second half of 2015.

The Group's oil related businesses were similarly impacted by
the increasing oil supply-demand gap combined with a signifi-
cant increase in oil supply from especially US shale and OPEC
production. This resulted in a continued oil price decline in the
second half of 2015, leading to significant layoffs and reduction
of activities across the global oil industry.

The Group reacted to the unexpected challenges by trimming
our businesses through accelerating and initiating further cost-
reduction initiatives across all our businesses, cancelling sailings
and laying up vessels in our shipping businesses, reducing our
oil exploration activities as well as reviewing, postponing and
cancelling investments across our businesses. We further
strengthened our focus on delivering value to our customers
and ensuring our fair share of activities.

With six out of eight businesses, equal to more than 93% of
the Group's invested capital, delivering top quartile perfor-
mance in their industries end of 02 2015, we have executed
on our strategy, and we will continue to do so, even in diffi-
cult times. Our global network of businesses, strong global
brand, highly skilled workforce and strong balance sheet,
gives us an excellent platform to benefit from the current
downturn and thereby augment our winning position in
the industries in which we compete. We continue to pursue
value creating investment opportunities within and adjacent

to our present industries, however only when we believe that
we can create sufficient value.

In 2015, global economic conditions remained unpredictable and
our businesses and long-term assets were significantly impacted
by large short-term volatility. Predicting the value and future
income streams from our assets in such volatile times remains
uncertain, but on the basis of our current market position and
historical performance we continue to believe in our ability to
outperform competition in our businesses and we remain con-
fident in our aspiration to be a premium conglomerate.

The Group delivered a profit of USD 925m (USD 5.2bn) anda
ROIC of 2.9% (11.0%) in 2015, negatively impacted by post tax im-
pairments of USD 2.6bn on oil assets due to the low oil price ex-
pectations as well as the revenue impact from the lower oil price
and lower average container freight rates. The impairments
of USD 80m in 02 and USD 2.5bn in 04 were primarily related
to production assets with short lifetime such as Kazakhstan,
Kurdistan and the UK as well as our deepwater development
assets in Angola and Brazil, where the current conditions do
not allow for viable projects. While we have fully impaired the
assets and significantly reduced our on-site activities in Angola
and Brazil, we continue our efforts to seek solutions in Angola
through concept changes and negotiations with authorities,
partners and contractors, and in Brazil we are pursuing exten-
sions of the Wahoo and Itaipu licences which expired in 04 2015.

The underlying profit of USD 3.1bn was within our expectations
of around USD 3.4bn. Compared to last year, profits were lower
in Maersk Line, Maersk Oil and APM Terminals and higher in
Maersk Drilling and APM Shipping Services.

The Group's cash flow from operating activities remained at a
high level of USD 8.0bn (USD 8.8bn) and net cash flow used for
capital expenditure came at USD 6.3bn (USD 6.2bn), excluding
the sale of shares in Danske Bank of USD 4.9bn.

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

With an equity ratio of 57.3% (61.3%) and a liquidity reserve
of USD 12.4bn (USD 11.6bn), the Group maintains its strong
financial position.

Maersk Line made a profit of USD 1.3bn (USD 2.3bn) anda ROIC
of 6.5% (11.6%). The underlying profit declined to USD 1.3bn (USD
2.2bn) due to poor market conditions leading to significantly
lower freight rates, in particular in the second half of the year,
only partially offset by lower bunker prices, USD appreciation
and cost efficiencies.

Maersk Oil made a loss of USD 2.1bn (loss of USD 861m) and
a ROIC of negative 38.6% (negative 15.2%). The result was neg-
atively affected by impairments after tax of USD 2.6bn due to
the low oil price expectations. The underlying profit was USD
435m (USD 1.0bn) negatively impacted by lower average oil

APM Terminals made a profit of USD 654m (USD 900m) and
a ROIC of 10.9% (14.7%). The underlying profit declined to USD
626m (USD 849m) due to lower volumes particularly in West
Africa, Russia and Brazil only partly offset by revenue improve-
ment and cost saving initiatives. APM Terminals accelerated
their global growth ambition with several significant acquisi-
tions and new projects.

Maersk Drilling made a profit of USD 751m (USD 478m) and
an underlying profit of USD 732m (USD 471m) positively im-
pacted by good contract coverage, fleet growth, cost savings
and strong operational performance. Furthermore, the result

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR

Maersk Line placed three newbuilding orders for a total of 27
vessels with a total capacity of 367,000 TEU. Further invest-
ments have been postponed due to the weak market conditions.

During the first part of 2015, the implementation of the Vessel
Sharing Agreement (VSA) with Mediterranean Shipping Com-
pany (MSC) on the East-West network was completed success-
fully with the phase-in of 193 vessels.

For Maersk Oil, the unmanned Tyra South East platform in
the Danish North Sea delivered first oil as planned in O1.

Qatar Petroleum initiated a tender process for the selection of a
partner to undertake the future development of the Al Shaheen
field, when the current agreement expires in mid-2017.

The Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approved
the field development plan for the first phase in the Norwegian
Johan Sverdrup field, where Maersk Oil is expected to invest
around USD 1.8bn. First oil is expected in 2019. The Norwegian
Authority changed Maersk Oil's share of the Johan Sverdrup
field from 8.12% to 8.44% with a final ruling from the King in
Council in December 2015.

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

The Maersk Oil operated Culzean gas field was sanctioned by
the UK government in 03 with a total field development capex
programme of around USD 4.5bn. Maersk Oil is expected to
contribute with USD 2.3bn of this. First gas from Culzean is ex-
pected in 2019.

Maersk Oil agreed to acquire half of Africa Oil Corporation's
ownership in three onshore exploration licences in Kenya and
two in Ethiopia. The licences include nine recent oil discov-
eries with ongoing exploration and appraisal activities. The
acquisition price is split between an upfront payment of USD
365m including committed exploration costs and future con-
tingent payments of up to USD 480m for the Lokichar Project
depending on the resource volume after final appraisal and
the timing for first oil. The transaction is expected to be com-
pleted in 2016.

APM Terminals agreed to acquire 100% of the shares in Grup
Maritim TCB (TCB), the leading Spanish container terminal
operator, with terminals located in Spain, Colombia, Brazil,
Mexico, Guatemala and Turkey. APM Terminals’ global termi-
nal network will grow from 63 to 74 terminals in 37 countries
across five continents and with additional seven terminals
under implementation. The 11 acquired TCB terminals add an
additional 4.3m TEU in capacity and 3.5m TEU in estimated an-
nual container volumes (2.6m TEU throughput when weighted
with APM Terminals’ ownership interest in the individual
terminals). The acquisition has an implied enterprise value of
USD 1.1bn with additional capex investments of USD 400m over
the next five years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the trans-
action is expected to be completed in O1 2016.

APM Terminals agreed to invest around USD 800m in a new-
built container terminal and connected road infrastructure
next to its present facility in Tema, Ghana, with 3.5m TEU
annual throughput capacity. During 2015, APM Terminals
also agreed to invest in a greenfield grain terminal in Qingdao,

China and acquired a terminal in Cartagena, Colombia as
well as a reefer terminal in Vado, Italy. Additionally, APM
Terminals upgraded and expanded a number of its terminals
globally.

Maersk Drilling took delivery of one drillship, Maersk Voyager,
and one ultra harsh environment jack-up rig, Maersk Integrator.
Maersk Drilling has one ultra harsh jack-up rig under construc-
tion to be delivered in 2016. Maersk Drilling signed seven new
contracts during 2015, among which the drillship Maersk
Voyager secured a long-term contract of 3.5 years offshore
Ghana, Maersk Resilient secured a three-year contract and
Meersk Giant received a contract for 150 days, both for work
in the Danish sector of the North Sea. Furthermore, Maersk
Drilling signed five contract extensions, including a five-year
extension for Heydar Aliyev working in the Caspian Sea, anda
three-year extension for Maersk Discoverer working offshore
Egypt. Although at significantly lower day rates compared to
previous contracts, the new contracts and extensions added
USD 2.0bn to Maersk Drilling’s revenue backlog and 8,700 con-
tracted rig days.

As part of the fleet renewal, Maersk Tankers signed a new-
building contract for nine MR vessels with a contract value of
approximately USD 300m. The order book totals 17 MR new-
buildings to be added to the fleet over the next three years.
With the re-delivery of three VLCCs in 2015, Maersk Tankers
has two chartered VLCC vessels left in the fleet.

MAJOR PORTFOLIO DECISIONS

The sale of Danske Bank shares was finalised with 85% ordered
by AP. Moller Holding A/S and 7% by other shareholders, at an
offer price of DKK 177.27 per Danske Bank share. The Group's
retained 1.6% ownership in Danske Bank is classified as held
for trading. With the completed sale of the Dansk Supermarked
Group in 2014 and Danske Bank in 2015, the Maersk Group has
finalised its major portfolio adjustments.

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

GUIDANCE
FOR 2016

The Maersk Group expects an under-
lying result significantly below last year
(USD 3.1bn). Gross cash flow used for
capital expenditure is expected to be
around USD 7bn in 2016 (USD 7.1bn).

Forward-looking statements

The Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Such
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as various

factors, many of which are beyond A.P. Maller - Meersk A/S’

control, may cause actual development and results to differ
materially from expectations contained in the Annual Report.

Maersk Line expects an underlying result significantly below
last year (USD 1.3bn) as a consequence of the significantly lower
freight rates going into 2016 and the continued low growth with
expected global demand for seaborne container transportation
to increase by 1-3%.

Maersk Oil expects a negative underlying result (profit of USD
435m). Breakeven is reached with oil prices in the range USD
45-55 per barrel.

Maersk Oil's entitlement production is expected to be around
315,000 boepd (312,000 boepd). Exploration costs are expected
to be in line with 2015 (USD 423m).

APM Terminals expects an underlying result around the 2015
level (USD 626m).

Maersk Drilling expects an underlying result significantly
below last year (USD 732m) mainly due to lower dayrates and
more idle days.

APM Shipping Services expects the underlying result to be
significantly below the 2015 result (USD 404m) predominantly
due to significantly lower rates and activity in Maersk Supply
Service.

= Contents

SENSITIVITY GUIDANCE

The Group's guidance for 2016 is subject to considerable uncer-
tainty, not least due to developments in the global economy,
the container freight rates and the oil price.

The Group's expected underlying result depends on a number
of factors. Based on the expected earnings level and all other
things being equal, the sensitivities for the calendar year 2016
for four key value drivers are listed in the table below:

Effect on the Group's
underlying profit

Oil price for Maersk Oil +/-10 USD/barrel +/-USD 0.35bn

Bunker price +/-100 USD/tonne -/+USD 0.3bn

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

THE GROUP
STRATEGY

Maersk Group is executing

on the strategy to be a premium
conglomerate with six of our eight
businesses, representing more than
93% of the Group's invested capital,
being top quartile performers in their
industries.

We have focused the Group's portfolio by divesting non-core
assets, and we continue to apply a rigorous and disciplined
methodology for allocating capital to our businesses.

We will continue to build a premium conglomerate through
active portfolio and performance management, disciplined
capital allocation and a clear financial strategy. The Group's
financial ambition is to develop its businesses and achieve
above 10% ROIC over the cycle.

OUR SUCCESS FACTORS

As agroup, our business success is built on a number of strengths:
our size and global reach, our financial flexibility, our talented
employees, our time-honoured values, our commitment to safety
and sustainability and our drive to innovate.

Weuse our global network, skilled people and financial flexi-
bility to enable customers and countries to create wealth and
fulfil their economic potential. Our existing strong position in
growth markets will remain a focus area going forward, as
the Group is in a good position to profit from growth when it
returns.

THE GROUP STRATEGY PROCESS

The Board of Directors performs an annual strategy review to
ensure that the Group's strategy is regularly assessed according
to market developments. The integrated Group strategy review,
portfolio actions and capital prioritisation process starts at the
beginning of the year. The Board of Directors have their annual
strategy conference in June at which the Board discusses pro-
posals put forward by the Executive Board and decides on the
strategy.

Strategies, including detailed plans and opportunities for the
coming years, are developed for each business. The total capital
requirement across businesses is prioritised with a view to op-
timise the portfolio of the Group in line with financial policies.

= Contents

Evaluation parameters include industry attractiveness, financial
return forecasts, business performance and overall strategic
aspirations. The resulting plan provides the framework for each
business unit. Portfolio adjustments are integrated into the plan.

The outcome of the Board of Directors’ annual strategy confer-
ence will, as in previous years, be communicated in connection
with the Group's Interim Report for 02 2016. The outcome will
be available for download from:
http://investor.maersk.com/financials.cfm.

Between each strategy session, Management and the Board
evaluate the development compared to expectations, and
these evaluations give rise to short-term tactical adjustments
of our investment plans and key focus areas.

STRATEGY UPDATE

The low global economic growth with resulting low container
freight rates and oil price has fundamentally changed the short-
term outlook of almost all of our businesses. As a consequence,
we updated our business unit strategies during 2015 to provide
more flexibility on the short-term financial targets as we main-
tain our key focus on competitiveness and our customers.

The changed market conditions unfortunately also necessitated
achange to the Group's priorities for 2015, as all business units
were required to accelerate on cost and efficiency programmes
in order to improve profitability and remain ahead of competi-
tors, while at the same time revising the targets for short-term
organic growth.

In October, we downgraded our expectations for Maersk Line's
and the Group’s results for 2015, and consequently Maersk
Line adjusted the plans for short-term growth by postponing
further investments beyond our firm commitments to ship
yards.

410/102 b


--- Page 7 ---

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

The competitiveness of our businesses instills confidence in
our ability to weather the storm and we will continue to work
on further strengthening our strong foothold in our industries.

Difficult times also present opportunities and given our strong
financial position, we are making focused investments to pursue
growth.

In order to maintain and grow our businesses and thereby
achieve our ambition of a ROIC above 10% over the cycle, we
have to accept that in a low interest environment we have
to also opt for investments that at present do not on a stand-
alone basis fully comply with our 10% ROIC target.

Net interest-bearing debt is managed in line with the Maersk
Group's current Baal/BBB+ credit rating. The Group generally
intends to centralise funding at parent company level and to
raise funds from diversified sources, including bonds.

Focusing the Group's portfolio

After the sale of our shares in Danske Bank, the Group's remain-
ing businesses are all related to shipping or energy markets.
The proceeds from the sale were returned to shareholders as
an extraordinary dividend.

We maintain our focus on active portfolio and performance
management and we have created a strong platform for future
investment, growth and innovation.

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

FINANCIAL
REVIEW

The Group's profit for the year
was USD 925m (USD 5.2bn) and
the equity totalled USD 35.7bn
(USD 42.2bn).

The review of the financial statement is carried out
through the presentation of the Group’s businesses.

INCOME STATEMENT

Revenue decreased to USD 40.3bn (USD 47.6bn), predominantly
due to lower oil price and lower average container freight rates
only partly compensated by higher entitlement production. The
operating expenses decreased by USD 4.4bn mainly due to lower
bunker prices and cost saving initiatives.

Profit decreased by USD 4.3bn to USD 925m (USD 5.2bn). The
profit for 2015 was primarily impacted by the net impairments
after tax of USD 2.6bn on oil assets due to the low oil price ex-
pectations as well as the revenue impact from the lower oil
price and lower average container freight rates.

The profit in 2014 was positively impacted by a USD 2.8bn gain
from the sale of the majority share of Dansk Supermarked Group
and other divestment gains of USD 600m partly offset by net im-
pairments after tax of USD 2.2bn primarily related to the Brazilian
oil assets of USD 1.7bn, UK oil assets of USD 188m and goodwill
in Svitzer of USD 357m.

Further comments to the profit development are provided
per segment below.

MAERSK LINE

Maersk Line made a profit of USD 1.3bn (USD 2.3bn) anda
ROIC of 6.5% (11.6%). The underlying profit was USD 1.3bn
(USD 2.2bn).

Revenue of 23.7bn was 13.2% lower than in 2014 (USD 27.4bn).
The development was driven by a 16.0% decline in average freight
rates to 2,209 USD/FFE (2,630 USD/FFE) and only partially
offset by a 0.8% increase in volumes to 9,522 FFE (9,442 FFE).

The freight rate decline was largely attributable to bunker price
savings being passed through to customers and to deteriorating
market conditions. Container freight rates declined across all
trades except North America, especially in Maersk Line's key

= Contents

trades to/from Europe and Latin America. Recognised freight
revenue was USD 21.3bn (USD 25.0bn) and other revenue was
USD 2.4bn (USD 2.4bn).

To minimise the impact of declining freight rates, Maersk Line
accelerated further network rationalisations and operating
cost reduction programmes. In response to the weakening de-
mand, Maersk Line also reduced capacity by closing down four
services and adjusted the network over the course of 2015.

Global container demand is expected to have grown between
0-1% in 2015 compared to 2014 while the global container fleet
grew by almost 8%. The low growth is primarily due to weaker
imports into Europe as well as slowdown in emerging economies.

The EBIT margin gap to peers is estimated at around 6.6% for
the full year (04 2014 to Q3 2015) and around 5% for the last
quarter (03 2015), on par with the 5% ambition level. The EBIT
margin gap to peers narrowed considerably compared to 2014
(9%) as a consequence of the sharp decline in bunker prices,
as well as Maersk Line's relatively higher exposure to the key
Europe trades which was more impacted by the freight rate
decline than other trades. Maersk Line responded to the chal-
lenging market conditions by accelerating its cost focus, and
in November, Maersk Line announced its plans to reduce the
organisation by more than 4,000 staff positions by 2017.

Unit cost decreased by 11.5% to 2,288 USD/FFE benefitting from.
decreased bunker prices and USD appreciation. Bunker cost de-
creased 42.8% compared to 2014 driven by lower bunker prices.
Bunker efficiency deteriorated by 1.0% to 931 kg/FFE (921 kg/FFE).
Maersk Line's fleet utilisation was lower than expected in 2015
as reduction initiatives were only taken late in the year to adapt
to the weaker than expected market demand.

By the end of 2015, the Maersk Line fleet consisted of 285 owned
vessels (1.8m TEU) and 305 chartered vessels (1.1m TEU) witha

413/102 >

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

total capacity of 3.0m TEU, an increase of 0.5% compared to the
end of 2014. Idle capacity at the end of 2015 was 32,733 TEU (four
vessels) versus 18,138 TEU (three vessels) at the end of 2014.
Maersk Line's idle capacity corresponds to around 2% of total
idle capacity in the market.

The global container fleet grew by around 8% compared to 2014.
At the end of 2015, it stood at 20m TEU of which 7.0% were idle.
Deliveries amounted to 1.7m TEU (214 vessels) and 203,000
TEU (107 vessels) were scrapped during 2015. New ordering
amounted to 2.3m TEU (254 vessels), keeping the order book
close to 20% of the fleet (Alphaliner).

In 04, Maersk Line entered into an agreement to divest its five
Multi Purpose Vessels (MPV). Maersk Line will exit the MPV
segment during Q1 2016.

Cash flow from operating activities decreased by USD 848m to
USD 3.3bn compared to 2014. Cash flow used for capital expend-
iture was USD 169m higher at USD 2.1bn primarily related to
delivery of five Triple-E vessels and ordering of 27 new vessels
during 2015. In spite of challenging market conditions, Maersk
Line delivered a positive free cash flow of USD 1.1bn (USD 2.1bn)
in 2015.

MAERSK OIL

Maersk Oil reported a loss of USD 2.1bn (loss of USD 861m due
to Brazilian impairment) and a ROIC of negative 38.6% (nega-
tive 15.2%) with an underlying profit of USD 435m (USD 1.0bn).

The result was negatively affected by net impairments after tax
of USD 2.6bn due to the low oil price expectations. The impair-
ments were primarily related to production assets with short
lifetime such as Kazakhstan, Kurdistan and the UK as well as
our deepwater development assets in Angola and Brazil, where
the current conditions do not allow for viable projects. While
we have fully impaired the assets and significantly reduced our

on-site activities in Angola and Brazil, we continue our efforts to
seek solutions in Angola through concept changes and negoti-
ations with authorities, partners and contractors, and in Brazil
we are pursuing extensions of the Wahoo and Itaipu licenses
which expired in 04 2015.

The underlying profit of USD 435m was negatively affected by
the lower average oil price of USD 52 per barrel versus USD 99
per barrel in 2014. This was partly offset by 24% higher entitle-
ment production of 312,000 boepd (251,000 boepd), deferred tax
income of USD 170m due to reduction of the UK tax rate and
45% lower exploration costs of USD 423m (USD 765m).

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 1.8bn (USD 2.6bn).
Cash flow used for capital expenditure of USD 2.0bn was 8.2%
lower than 2014 (USD 2.2bn) with the recent sanctioned Johan
Sverdrup in Norway, and Culzean in the UK contributing
the most.

The increased entitlement production came primarily from the
UK increase of 76% where Golden Eagle came on stream in 04
2014, from Qatar with an increase of 29% where the decreased
oil prices give more barrels for cost recovery as well as from
Jack in the US coming on stream in 04 2014 delivering a Maersk
Oil entitlement production of 6,000 boepd. The increases were
partly offset by the natural field decline in Denmark by 7%.

Maersk Oil reduced operating expenses, excluding exploration
costs, by 12% to USD 2.5bn (USD 2.8bn). This is in line with the
targeted 20% reduction by the end of 2016 compared to the 2014
baseline. As a consequence, the total number of positions was
reduced by approximately 1,250 during 2015.

Maersk Oil completed nine exploration and appraisal wells. The
East Swara Tika-1 well in Kurdistan found hydrocarbons in com-
mercial volumes whereas four wells encountered hydrocarbons
in sub-commercial volumes and four wells were dry.

= Contents

The 2012 development project at the Al Shaheen field offshore
Qatar is progressing as planned and more than 80% of the drilling
programme is now completed.

Recent acquisitions to be completed in 2016 include interest
in exploration licences in Kenya and Ethiopia. The Kenyan au-
thorities have approved the transaction whereas Ethiopia is
still pending. Shortly after the acquisition, an exploration well
encountered oil and commercial viability of the discovery is
being assessed.

The yearly update of Maersk Oil's reserves and resources as per
end of 2014 showed entitlement reserves and resources (2P+2C)
of 1.31bn barrels of oil equivalent (1.47bn) including proved and
probable (2P) reserves of 0.50bn barrels of oil equivalent (0.60bn).
2015 reserves and resources numbers will be released in connec-
tion with the Interim Report for 01 2016.

APM TERMINALS

APM Terminals made a profit of USD 654m (USD 900m) and
a ROIC of 10.9% (14.7%) with an underlying profit of USD 626m
(USD 849m). The low oil price resulted in a sharp decline in
import volumes into oil producing countries in West Africa,
Russia and Brazil. Along with divestments in 2014, this caused
revenue to decrease by 4.8% and the EBITDA-margin to decrease
by 2.7% compared to last year (22.7%). Operating business
generated a profit of USD 696m (USD 931m) while projects
under implementation had a loss of USD 42m (loss of USD 31m)
stemming from their upstart costs.

The 2014 result was positively impacted by net divestment
gains after tax of USD 232m and negatively affected by USD
181m impairments related to European activities of which USD
154m was related to joint venture companies. The result for
2015 does not include any impairment but includes net divest-
ment gains of USD 10m and positive impact from reversed im-
pairments of USD 14m.

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

Global market conditions have had an unfavourable effect
on container volumes and rates in several key terminals.
Specifically, key terminals in oil dependent markets have de-
clined significantly compared to 2014. Partly mitigating this,
performance in APM Terminals’ North American businesses
has increased compared to 2014, mainly due to increased vol-
ume and storage income.

The number of containers handled by APM Terminals (weighted
with APM Terminals’ ownership interest) decreased by 6.0%
compared to 2014, reaching 36.0m TEU (38.3m TEU). The de-
crease was mainly due to divestments of terminal facilities in
Charleston, Jacksonville and Houston, USA, and Gioia Tauro,
Italy, in 2015 as well as APM Terminals, Virginia, USA, and Termi-
nal Porte Océane S.A. Le Havre, France, in 2014. Excluding these
divestments, like-for-like volumes decreased by 1.1%, whereas
the overall global container market grew by 1.3% (Drewry).

Revenue improvement and cost saving initiatives continue to
be driven across the global portfolio and have delivered ap-
proximately USD 200m to the bottom line, however the impact
from the adverse market conditions was only partly mitigated.

The acquisition of the TCB portfolio will initially have a negative
impact on ROIC of just over one percentage point due to the
increased asset base and the amortisation of terminal rights.
The acquisition has an implied enterprise value of USD 1.1bn
with additional capex investments of USD 400m over the next
five years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is
expected to be completed in O1 2016.

The share of profit in joint ventures and associated companies
increased to USD 199m (USD 79m), mainly caused by the USD
154m impairments in joint venture companies in 2014.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 874m (USD 925m).
Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 774m (positive
USD 2m).

MAERSK DRILLING

Maersk Drilling delivered a profit of USD 751m (USD 478m)
generating a ROIC of 9.3% (7.1%), positively impacted by good
contract coverage, fleet growth, cost savings and strong op-
erational performance. The result was also positively impacted
by fewer yard stays and further a gain from the sale of the
Venezuela business partly offset by increased idle time and
Maersk Endurer (built 1984) being decommissioned and recycled
in July 2015. The underlying profit was USD 732m (USD 471m).

The economic utilisation of the fleet was 85% (90%) adversely
affected by increased idle time. The average operational up-
time was 98% (97%) for the jack-up rigs and 94% (96%) for
the floating rigs. Maersk Drilling’s safety performance saw a
further improvement in the LTI frequency from 0.57 to 0.31
during the year as a result of a relentless drive towards an
incident free workplace.

Although at significantly lower day rates compared to pre-
vious contracts, the new contracts and extensions signed in
2015 added 8,700 rig days and USD 2.0bn to Maersk Drilling’s
revenue backlog. At the end of 2015, Maersk Drilling's forward
contract coverage was 77% for 2016, 52% for 2017 and 43% for
2018. The total revenue backlog by the end of the year amounted
to USD 5.4bn (USD 6.0bn).

While significant uncertainty remains in the medium to long-
term outlook for offshore drilling services and particularly the
deepwater market, Maersk Drilling maintains a competitive
advantage due to its comparatively young rig fleet, although
the short-term profitability will continue to be under pressure.

The semi-submersible rig Meersk Deliverer finalised yard stay as
planned and was back on operating rate mid-September 2015.

Operating costs increased due to four new rigs entering the
fleet and starting operation during the last six quarters partly
offset by the divestment of the Venezuela business in 03 2014.

= Contents

The initiated cost reduction and efficiency enhancement pro-
gramme delivered a saving of more than 8% in 2015 compared.
to 2014, excluding positive effect from exchange rates.

The increased cash flow from operating activities of USD 1.3bn
(USD 701m) was mainly related to three additional rigs in oper-
ation and cost savings. Cash flow used for capital expenditure
declined to USD 854m (USD 2.2bn), mainly due to fewer instal-
ments paid for the newbuild projects.

APM SHIPPING SERVICES

APM Shipping Services made a profit of USD 446m (loss of
USD 230m) and a ROIC of 9.5% (negative 4.2%). The under-
lying profit was USD 404m (USD 185m).

Maersk Tankers made a profit of USD 160m (USD 132m) and
a ROIC of 9.9% (6.8%). The underlying profit was USD 156m.
(USD 139m). The result was positively affected by improved
rates and cost saving initiatives.

Average Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) earnings in the prod-
uct segments increased by 29% compared to 2014 due to
higher demand in the market for transportation of refined
oil products.

Operating cost decreased mainly as a result of cost saving ini-
tiatives contributing positively by USD 16m, the divestment of
the VLCC vessels, re-delivery of long-term chartered tonnage

and lower bunker fuel costs.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 291m (USD 232m).
Net cash flow from capital expenditure was USD 185m (positive
USD 650m), primarily driven by the acquisition of nine Product
tankers and newbuilding instalments, partly offset by the sale of
eight Product tankers and two VLCC vessels.

During 2015, Maersk Tankers took delivery of two MR new-
buildings and placed an order for nine more vessels. The order

415/102 >

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

book totals 17 vessels, of which seven will be delivered during
2016, and the last ten in the following two years.

Maersk Supply Service reported a profit of USD 147m (USD
201m) and a ROIC of 8.5% (11.9%). The underlying profit was
USD 117m (USD 189m).

Revenue for the year decreased to USD 613m (USD 778m) fol-
lowing lower rates and lower utilisation as well as fewer vessel
days available due to divestments and lay-ups. The decreased
revenue was partly mitigated by significant cost reductions
with total operating costs at USD 345m (USD 430m).

The continued market decline in the offshore industry led to
a number of vessel lay-ups globally, including Maersk Supply
Service with nine vessels laid up at the end of the year. Asa
consequence, Maersk Supply Service announced during the
year the need to adjust the crew pool by more than 300 off-
shore positions and a 15% reduction in headquarter positions.

Contract coverage going into 2016 was 42% (50% for 2015)
and 16% (29% for 2016) for 2017.

Cash flow from operating activities decreased to USD 250m.
(USD 356m) primarily caused by a lower operational result.
Cash flow used for capital expenditure increased to USD 206m
(USD 188m) mainly due to investment in a second hand vessel.

During the year Maersk Supply Service took delivery of anew
Anchor Handling Tug Supply vessel (AHTS), acquired one sec-
ond hand Subsea Support vessel and sold five AHTS. Total order
book stands at 11 vessels.

Svitzer delivered a profit of USD 120m (loss of USD 270m) anda
ROIC of 10.9% (negative 19.2%). The underlying profit was USD
116m (USD 82m). The 2014 result was impacted by goodwill im-
pairment of USD 357m primarily related to the 2007 Adsteam.

acquisition in Australia. Disregarding goodwill impact, 2015 saw
a positive development compared to 2014 due to successfully
implemented cost and productivity initiatives.

Revenue decreased by USD 143m as a result of a substantially
stronger USD compared to AUD and EUR, as well as salvage
revenue being excluded after the activities were merged with
Titan Salvage, USA (USD 80m). These effects were partly offset
by higher activity in harbour towage and Svitzer's entry into
Brazil.

The industry experienced significant overcapacity and slow-
down in most shipping segments, not least bulk trades, but
Svitzer managed to increase its market share in competitive
ports in both Australia and Europe.

Underlying profitability improved through pricing, produc-
tivity and cost saving initiatives, which resulted in an EBITDA
margin of 28.4% (20.9%).

Cash flow from operating activities decreased to USD 138m.
(USD 203m) driven by salvage activities. Cash flow from in-
vesting activities decreased by USD 83m to USD 152m.

Damco made a profit of USD 19m (loss of USD 293m) anda
ROIC of 7.1% (negative 63.2%). The underlying profit was USD
15m (loss of USD 225m).

Productivity improvements, overhead cost reductions and
growth in supply chain management activities were the pri-
mary drivers behind the improved result.

Revenue was USD 2.7bn (USD 3.2bn), with the reduction largely
caused by rate of exchange movements. Margins in both ocean
and airfreight segments saw improvements, whereas ocean
freight volumes declined over the whole of 2015 and ended
9% below 2014, partly due to de-selection of less-profitable

= Contents

business. Airfreight volumes fell by 4% over 2015, but grew
through the second half of the year. Supply chain management
volumes continued to show improvements and ended 5%
above 2014.

Over the past two years, Damco has been through a transfor-
mation phase and is now starting to see the planned benefits.
Costs have been reduced and productivity has increased with
improved bottom-line profitability and cash generation as out-
come, bringing Damco to a profitable result for 2015.

Cash flow from operating activities was positive USD 127m
(negative USD 201m) due to the improved operational result
and reduced working capital through stricter cash manage-
ment.

OTHER BUSINESSES

Other businesses made a profit of USD 316m (USD 408m). The
result for 2015 includes primarily the gain from the sale of
shares in Danske Bank of USD 223m and the sale of Esvagt of
USD 76m, while 2014 primarily included the Group's share of
profit in Danske Bank of USD 330m.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Discontinued operations included Dansk Supermarked Group
in 2014, while nothing was included as discontinued opera-
tions in 2015.

UNALLOCATED ACTIVITIES

Unallocated activities comprise activities which are not attrib-
utable to reportable segments, including financial items as well
as centralised purchasing and resale of bunker and lubricating
oil to companies in the Group. Financial items were negative by
USD 423m (negative by USD 606m); the positive development
was primarily driven by value adjustment on Danske Bank
shares, lower interest expenses due to lower debt and interest
rates as well as currency adjustments.

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

TAX

Companies in the Group are taxed under different tax regimes,
depending on location and activity. Special tax rules apply to
some of the Group's activities.

Generally, shipping activities are subject to a tonnage based or
similar tax system, under which the computation of taxable
income includes an amount calculated on the basis of the fleet's
tonnage. Moreover, in certain countries freight taxes are paid
mainly based on the gross freight income in those countries.

In most countries, oil and gas activities are subject to a special
form of taxation, which is often considerably higher than the
normal corporate tax rate.

The total tax charge for the Group in 2015 was USD 0.5bn (USD
3.0bn) of which taxes payable to Denmark were USD 0.2bn (USD

0.8bn). The amounts related to the special hydrocarbon tax were
USD O.1bn (USD 0.5bn) and USD 0.1bn (USD 0.3bn) represented
corporate tax on oil activities. The decrease in the special hydro-
carbon tax was largely due to the drop in oil prices. The shipping
activities’ tax payment to Denmark was USD 12m (USD 13m).

TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Total comprehensive income for the year was USD 540m (USD
3.6bn) and includes the profit for the year of USD 925m (USD
5.2bn) and other comprehensive income, which was negative
by USD 385m (negative by USD 1.6bn). Other comprehensive in-
come mainly includes exchange rate adjustment on translation
from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value
adjustment of certain securities, value adjustment of cash flow
hedges and actuarial gains and losses.

BALANCE SHEET
At 31 December 2015, total assets amounted to USD 62.4bn.
(USD 68.8bn).

Property, plant and equipment of USD 44.0bn (USD 44.7bn)
decreased by USD 672m. Investments in the year amounted to
USD 7.3bn (USD 8.9bn). Depreciation for the year was USD 4.6bn.
(USD 4.2bn) and net impairment losses of USD 2.1bn (loss of USD
421m) were recognised. Sale of property, plant and equipment
amounted to USD 773m (USD 512m) including the assets held
for sale. Currency adjustments resulted in a decrease of USD
435m (decrease of USD 399m).

For further description of significant accounting estimates and
judgements see note 25.

Derivatives were as of 31 December 2015 a net liability of USD
837m (net liability of USD 500m). The movement was primarily
related to the USD appreciating against main hedging currencies.

Cash and bank balances totalled USD 4.0bn (USD 3.5bn) at 31
December 2015, including offsetting bank overdrafts of USD
12m (USD 102m).

Equity totalled USD 35.7bn (USD 42.2bn). The decrease was
related to the extraordinary dividend related to the sale of the
Danske Bank shares of USD 5.2bn, the share buy-back of USD
780m, ordinary dividend paid of USD 1.0bn (USD 1.3bn) and other
comprehensive income is negative of USD 385m. The reduction
was partly offset by the profit for the year of USD 925m.

The actuarial net liability for pensions, etc. in relation to de-
fined benefit plans recognised totalled USD 131m (USD 217m) at
31 December 2015. Developments in the actuarial assumptions
as well as changes to the minimum funding requirements
resulted in actuarial gains of USD 68m (loss of USD 9m), which
are included in other comprehensive income. In 2015, the Group
paid USD 116m (USD 81m) to defined benefit plans.

Deferred tax liabilities totalled USD 280m (USD 701m) at 31
December 2015, and recognised deferred tax assets totalled USD

= Contents

891m (USD 536m). Furthermore, deferred tax assets of USD 1.9bn
(USD 1.5bn) have not been recognised, cf. note 9 in the consoli-
dated financial statements.

Net interest-bearing debt remained at the same level as at
the end of 2014 positively impacted by free cash flows of USD
6.6bn offset by ordinary dividend of USD 1.0bn, extraordinary
dividend of USD 5.2bn and share buy-back of USD 780m. In
2015, the Group issued bonds for USD 1.0bn in the US market
and EUR 600m in the euro market. USD 1.8bn of revolving
credit facilities were signed in 2015 while USD 687m of un-
drawn financing commitments were either cancelled or ex-
pired during 2015 due to the Group's strong liquidity position.

CASH FLOW

Cash flow from operating activities USD 8.0bn (USD 8.8bn) was
negatively impacted by the lower result which was partly offset
by decreased tax payments of USD 1.8bn and improved working
capital as well as lower interest payments.

Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 1.4bn (USD
6.2bn). The decrease was mainly due to the sale of Danske
Bank of USD 4.9bn.

OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS

The present value of the operating lease commitments totalled

USD 7.0bn at 31 December 2015 (USD 7.7bn at 31 December 2014)

using a discount rate of 6% (6%). The amount is divided into

the following main items:

e Maersk Line and Maersk Tankers of USD 3.3bn (USD 3.8bn)
primarily relating to vessels on time charter

¢ APM Terminals of USD 2.9bn (USD 3.1bn) primarily related
to future concession fees for port facilities

e Other commitments of USD 0.8bn (USD 0.8bn).

About one third of the time charter payments in Maersk Line
and in Maersk Tankers is estimated to relate to operational

RISK
MANAGEMENT

An established Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM) framework is embedded in the Group. This
enables and supports a consistent, robust and
focused approach to assessing the three main
categories comprising the Group's risk universe,
namely the Known Risks, the Emerging Risks
and the Portfolio Risks. The three categories are
explored through a combination of risk reporting,
internal analyses and external expert input. The
main findings are reviewed by the Executive Board
as well as the Board of Directors, and serve as
input to the annual strategy and capital alloca-
tion processes. The Audit Committee annually
reviews the process for adequacy and potential
improvements.

KNOWN RISKS

Known Risks are considered actual risks to business objectives
within the planning period 2016-2021. While some risks are in-
tegral in the industries we operate in and therefore are accepted
and managed as part of our operations, several risks continue
to have the potential of adversely impacting our business in the
short to medium term, such as:

Asharp and prolonged drop in oil prices continues to consti-
tute a key risk, as we are increasingly targeting technologically
demanding and costly industry segments. The declined and
persistently subdued oil price observed since end 2014 has led
to reduced cash flows and revised forecasts from our oil and oil
related businesses. The market developments and the duration
of the downturn exert pressure on securing commercially
viable contracts for Maersk Drilling, Maersk Supply Service
and the oil production pipeline in Maersk Oil. Ultimately this
could, in the long run, impact our ability to meet our financial
targets or moreover our investment and growth ambitions.
Conversely, the current environment, coupled with the Group's
financial strength, could also present investment opportuni-
ties within oil and oil related businesses. The Group is seeking
to mitigate this risk by continuing to be top quartile performer
through cost reduction programmes as well as by renegotiat-
ing terms with authorities, partners and contractors to make
projects more attractive.

A major accident or oil spill remains an inherent risk in the
Group's operations, particularly in the oil and gas, offshore and
tanker businesses. A high severity incident would first and
foremost present a risk to our employees as well as potentially
to the marine environment, wildlife and local communities. Ad-
ditionally it could result in large scale impact on assets, liquidity
position and reputation and put our license to operate at risk.
The Group is proactively building and supporting incident free
operations to mitigate this risk.

= Contents

A major cyber-attack could prove detrimental to our ability
to operate and deliver on our commitments, as the Group is
involved in complex and wide ranging global services, making
it highly dependent on well-functioning IT systems. Business
disruptions could be as severe as lasting several months, im-
pacting our fleet's and offshore equipments' ability to safely
continue operations. The Group is monitoring this threat closely
and proactively addresses it through enhancements of our
cyber resilience and focus on business continuity management
in the event that IT systems are affected.

A larger than expected downturn in the container market
underscores the severity of the threat that a potential widening
of the container liner business supply-demand imbalance could
be in an environment characterised by low global demand
growth. A structural gap and overcapacity, coupled with the
significant exposure that Maersk Line has to the Asia-Europe
trade where the larger vessels are increasingly deployed, leave
the Group vulnerable to substantial fluctuations in freight rates
and the risk of sustaining commercial losses. The Group is miti-
gating this risk by designing a competitive network, being a cost
leader in the industry, continuing to simplify the organisation
and optimising the network utilisation through alliances and
vessel sharing agreements.

The Board of Directors performs an annual strategy review to
ensure a regular assessment of the Group's strategy in accord-
ance with market dynamics, including developments in the oil
price and the fundamentals of the container freight markets.

EMERGING RISKS

Emerging Risks are potential future threats, looking over a time
horizon beyond that of the planning period. Most of our indus-
tries are capital intensive and investments often have long
return periods. As a consequence, we need to proactively con-
sider future uncertainties that may affect our earnings. This is
done through a comprehensive process aimed at identifying

419/102 >


--- Page 16 ---

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

emerging trends with the potential of posing long-term risks.
Some of the identified Emerging Risks are addressed through
deep dive studies. These studies facilitate a better understand-
ing of the key drivers, components and underlying dynamics
of the trend and the associated risks and opportunities. In se-
lecting the risks for further analysis, emphasis is put on their
assessed severity in terms of likelihood and impact, as well as
the velocity with which they may be approaching. Addition-
ally, the potential for action ability and support of informed
decision-making stemming from the gained insights are consid-
ered to optimise the use and focus of the Group's efforts and
resources in undertaking such studies.

In 2014, large vessel disasters surfaced as a potential signifi-
cant risk. Driven by rapid technological expansion in vessel
capacity and capability, the risk picture was considered rele-
vant for further analysis. Therefore, a deep dive study was con-
ducted to unveil the nature of the risk when considering the
tail risk scenarios, the triggers, the potential impacts as well
as existing key mitigations and possible future remedies to
further limit the exposure. Worst case scenarios and incidents
considered in the study were, among others, a vessel colliding
with an offshore installation or a total wreck removal. Techni-
cal, operational and process related perspectives were covered
during the analysis. The study was a wide collaboration within
the Group and has allowed for a deeper understanding of the
risks accompanying the inevitable technological progress. The
findings underscored the necessity of the already increased
focus and constant care, which the Group applies to the safety
of our seafarers and assets, as well as attention to all aspects,
including potential new risks, stemming from pursuing tech-
nological excellence.

Looking ahead, the Group continues to monitor developments
with the potential of impacting our business. Examples of
such dynamics surfacing as Emerging Risks in 2015 are the
prospects of shifts in trade flows from reshoring/nearshoring,

developments in the digital economy and its long-term effect on
shipping, as well as the projections of shale oil/gas reservoirs
development expansion outside North America and the result-
ing impact on the global supply of hydrocarbons.

PORTFOLIO RISKS

Being a global conglomerate spanning multiple geographies
and industries, the Group also considers risks associated with
its composition of businesses and countries of operation. This
means that when managing our portfolio, both dimensions are
assessed, ie. the balances in our industry exposure and our geo-
graphical presence. A depiction of the correlation between our
businesses, see the graph “Impact of diversification”, suggests

that managing them as a portfolio in a conglomerate, as op-
posed to standalone business areas, reduces the associated
risks. It also implies a well-diversified portfolio of businesses
capable of absorbing shocks inflicting volatility within single
businesses, evidenced by the Group's combined NOPAT vola-
tility being 31% lower than the aggregated volatility of the
four main individual businesses (those comprising solely one
industry). This combined volatility broadly remains unaffected
by recent portfolio concentration. From a geographic risk point
of view, the portfolio on average remains in the relatively low
risk category. The Group's agreed investments may modestly
increase this exposure, but it will overall remain well-balanced
by substantial investments in a number of low risk countries.

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

OUR
EMPLOY EES

During 2015, the Group introduced a new
job levelling structure, which applies across
all business units. MyCareer means that all
parts of the Group have a single, consistent
approach to both job grading and career
principles. It creates transparency and visi-
bility of different job opportunities and isa
platform for career development.

In 2015, we saw continued actions and progress towards our
diversity goals. More information on diversity can be obtained
from the Group's Sustainability Report.

The business units each have their key priorities and focus
areas to support their respective strategies; below are some
examples.

Maersk Line is progressing with the transformation to reduce
transactional work through standardisation and digitisation of
key processes. This transformation will result in a leaner, more
agile and more focused organisation.

At the same time, Maersk Line continues to invest in developing
our employees’ world-class leadership capabilities by bringing
Maersk Line leaders together to align on strategic direction and
vision and to accelerate personal development and help our
leaders to become more effective in driving the Maersk Line
strategy.

Maersk Oil is operating in a materially changed oil price envi-
ronment, which has led to necessary decisions to reduce activity
levels through 2015. This has resulted in a reduction of positions
by 1,250, affecting both employees and contractors. The busi-
ness remains focused on long-term growth opportunities, and
the staff reductions were done in a manner ensuring that we
safeguarded Maersk Oil's technical strengths and its good de-
mographic profile compared to industry peers.

The local content programmes in strategically important coun-
tries like Oatar, Kazakhstan and Angola, continue to drive devel-
opment of the local workforce, and in May 2015 Maersk Oil Qatar
won the award for the ‘Overall Best Support to Oatarization'
at the annual Oatarization Review Meeting of the Energy and
Industry Sector.

= Contents

APM Terminals continue its drive towards safe operations
across the business and achieved a substantial reduction in
high severity accidents, via the “Fatal 5" campaign focussing on
the five highest risk areas in terminal activities. APM Terminals
unfortunately suffered four fatal accidents in 2015.

For Maersk Drilling, all crews on the newbuildings delivered in
2014 and 2015 were hired well in advance, up to six months prior
to operation start, in order to participate in top class training
and performance enhancement, establish good teamwork and
ensure a safe and efficient operation of the new fleet.

Maersk Drilling aims to remain at the forefront of innovation
in safety, environment and operational efficiency within the
offshore oil and gas industry. The training conducted for all
new employees in Maersk Drilling has so far been very suc-
cessful, which is also why Maersk Drilling today has one of
the best safety and operational performance track records in
the industry. At the same time, ongoing competence building
is taking place for onshore staff, in technical, operational and
support functions, to enhance the overall performance in
Maersk Drilling and safeguard the internal talent pipeline for
the future.

Maersk Group — Annual Report 2015

INNOVATION

Maersk Maritime Technology successfully
manages a significant portion of the business
units' innovation. Furthermore, the Group Inno-
vation Board aims to identify and fund projects,
which are not directly related to the business
units' daily operations. Here are examples from
the Group's business units.

Maersk Line finalised the roll out of its Remote Container
Management (RCM) solution. Over 250,000 reefer containers
have now been equipped with a dedicated GPS unit, 3G high
temperature SIM card and two GSM antennas and terminals
have been trained in the new RCM processes. With near-real
time visibility into the conditions of each reefer container at
almost any part of the journey, RCM will optimise the opera-
tional processes leading to improved tracking and control of
high value reefer cargo.

Maersk Line also further invested in its data analytics and digital
capabilities. This will enable Maersk Line to optimise and mod-
ernise its processes and improve the usage of the vast amount of
data generated. Maersk Line continues to invest in improving the
quality and transparency of operational vessel data. Improved
fuel efficiency, voyage planning and operational efficiency con-
tinue to be an important innovation focus area.

During 2015, Maersk Line continued its retrofit programme
to upgrade its fleet with the latest energy efficiency technol-
ogies. Based on a technology screening, each vessel (class)

is retrofitted with a tailored package of technology improve-
ments. Maersk Line is working together with key partners
to prepare for upcoming regulations such as ballast water
and air emission abatement technologies. Maersk Line is also
working with the industry and regulators to find technologies
to ensure effective enforcement of recent sulphur regulations.
Effective enforcement of current and future sulphur regula-
tions is an important prerequisite to ensure a level playing
field in the maritime industry.

Maersk Oil is seeking to enhance business competitiveness
by developing further knowledge at extracting hydrocarbons
from complex reservoirs such as tight chalk reservoirs in the
North Sea and high-pressure, high-temperature fields like the
Culzean field. An example of this effort is Maersk Oil's and the
other Danish Underground Consortium partners’ investment
in the Danish Hydrocarbon Research & Technology Centre,
launched in September 2014, where the first major technology
programme has been initiated encompassing advanced water

= Contents

flooding of the Dan, Halfdan and Kraka fields. Other focus
areas are enhanced reservoir modelling, enhanced oil recovery
mechanisms and cost-effective well completions.

In addition, Maersk Oil is protecting own developed technology
with patent applications for new inventions, which in 2015 has
resulted in patent applications for new methods for improved
data and signal transmission in wells.

APM Terminals’ new Maasvlakte II facility is the world's first
fully-automated and emissions-free, sustainably-powered con-
tainer terminal. The facility has in 2015 transitioned from its
testing phase into operation, and despite start-up challenges,
the volume ramp-up continues.

Many of the systems and technologies applied in Maasvlakte II
willalso be utilised at APM Terminals’ project at Lazaro Cardenas,
Mexico. The terminal is expected to open late 2016, and will be
the first automated container terminal in Latin America and will
feature fully automated electric yard stacking cranes, and shuttle
carriers will be used for transport between the yard cranes and
ship to shore cranes.

Maersk Drilling is currently planning a test of Big Data analytic
tools for two applications: drilling productivity in order to in-
crease drilling efficiency as well as maintenance improvement in
order to reduce cost and to increase reliability. This will support
Maersk Drilling’s drive to reduce the overall maintenance cost,
including five-year survey cost, while maintaining uptime and
reliability. The tests are planned to be completed in 2016 and will
form the basis for an overall Big Data strategy in Maersk Drilling.

Maersk Drilling has designed the next generation drillship. To-
gether with key industry equipment and technology providers
the technical specification of the 20K™ drillship has been final-
ised. The 20K™ rigs will be able to safely and efficiently operate in
high-pressure, high-temperature reservoirs up to 20,000 pounds
per square inch and 350 degrees Fahrenheit. It will however
require higher oil prices before the new drillship can be realised
commercially.
